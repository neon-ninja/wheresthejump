1
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,509
It is said that blood
is thicker than water.

2
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,636
It is what defines us.

3
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,472
Binds us. Curses us.

4
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,182
Come, my love. Let's go.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,433
Come, Barnabas.

6
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:05,731
For some, blood means a life
of wealth and privilege.

7
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,317
For others, a life of servitude.

8
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,364
Angelique, how many times
do I have to tell you not to stare at him?

9
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,283
Remember your place.

10
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,412
When I was but a boy...

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,333
my father took us to the New World
to expand the Collins family empire.

12
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,920
We brought English industry
to the wilds of Maine...

13
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,506
and built a fishing business...

14
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,467
the likes of which America
had never seen.

15
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,014
A man should take pride in what he builds.

16
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:44,979
But remember, Barnabas,
family is the only real wealth.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,654
As our business grew,
the town of Collinsport grew with it...

18
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,450
and we decided to put down
permanent roots.

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,878
We spent the next 15 years
building our beloved home:

20
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,213
Collinwood.

21
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:20,723
But not everyone shared
in our family's success.

22
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,521
Let me hear you say
"I love you, Angelique. I want you."

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,862
Angelique...

24
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,031
I am sorry, my dear...

25
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,076
but you would be hearing a lie.

26
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,625
Make the high and mighty low

27
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,170
Arrogant creatures, down you go

28
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,773
Convinced my parents'
death was no accident...

29
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:15,319
I became obsessed with dark magic
and ancient curses.

30
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,614
"Lo! Above the gates of hell..."

31
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,284
he found a single letter.

32
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,621
A letter proclaiming Satan's true name.

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,208
"Mephistopheles."

34
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:36,799
But even then, in the depths
of my grief, not all was darkness.

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,553
For I had found my one true love.

36
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,305
Promise we'll be together forever.

37
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,600
God as my witness, Josette...

38
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,769
I swear it.

39
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,988
Of all the servants I could have spurned...

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,240
all the hearts I could have broken...

41
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,785
I got the one with the secret.

42
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,455
I got the witch.

43
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,624
If he doth another choose

44
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,419
To lend his heart an eye

45
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,964
Then magic shall the slighted use

46
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,092
So all he loves will

47
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,928
Die

48
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,182
Caught in Angelique's spell...

49
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,393
my beloved Josette wandered
helplessly towards Widow's Hill...

50
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,606
where many a despondent soul
had leapt to their death.

51
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,986
Josette!

52
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,224
Josette.

53
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,688
Help me.

54
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,430
Josette!

55
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,816
What have you done?!

56
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,492
Angelique had cursed me to be a vampire...

57
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,246
so that my suffering would never end.

58
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,266
There's the monster.

59
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,942
Resolved that I would
never belong to her...

60
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,527
Angelique turned the townspeople
against me...

61
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,782
and condemned me to suffer
my anguish alone in the dark...

62
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,991
Let me out!

63
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,284
For all time.

64
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,828
Let me out, I say!

65
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,499
Release me!

66
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,278
Hello. My name is Maggie Ev...

67
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,540
Hello. My name is Victoria Winters.

68
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,168
Please, call me Vicky.

69
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,007
So where are you from, Veronica?

70
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,094
New York. And it's Victoria.

71
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,139
"And it's Victoria." I
love this chick, man.

72
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,475
New York's a trip?

73
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,935
I guess.

74
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,022
What about you?

75
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,275
What brings a New York girl
out to the sticks?

76
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,322
An old friend.

77
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,330
- Be cool.
- Have a nice day.

78
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,085
- Catch you later.
- Take it easy, Veronica.

79
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,668
Hello. I'm Victoria Winters.

80
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,169
Congratulations.

81
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,007
I'm here to see Ms. Stoddard
about the governess position.

82
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,094
Oh, yeah. Been expecting you.

83
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,595
Come on.

84
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,516
Sorry I didn't grab you
down at the station.

85
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,476
Damn wagon's been acting up.

86
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,063
Miss Elizabeth won't spend the money
to get her fixed.

87
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,606
It's beautiful.

88
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,859
A bitch to dust is what it is.

89
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,863
This place was designed
for a staff of a hundred.

90
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,282
Now they got a staff of me.

91
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,326
Me and Mrs. Johnson.

92
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,621
She's about as useful
as a bucket without a bottom.

93
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,042
Still, not every family
has a house like this.

94
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,545
Or a whole town named after them.

95
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,213
Come again?

96
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,549
Collins. "Collinsport."

97
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,635
Never got that.

98
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,721
Who's that?

99
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,557
Barnaby, maybe.

100
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,892
Something with a "Barn" in it.

101
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,145
One of the real important ones
from way back.

102
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,565
Back when they were rich, rich people.

103
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,442
Barnabas.

104
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,070
His name was Barnabas Collins.

105
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,073
And he was the finest man
this family ever knew.

106
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,243
Welcome to Collinwood.

107
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,079
You'll have to imagine us
on a better day.

108
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,416
The house has some 200 rooms...

109
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,753
most closed off to save on heating.

110
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,507
We don't even go in
the old wing any more.

111
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,384
Sit.

112
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,220
There are only seven of us, after all.

113
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,389
My daughter, Carolyn, and I.

114
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,850
My brother, Roger, and his son, David.

115
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,520
Willie, who you've met.

116
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,774
Mrs. Johnson and Dr. Hoffman...

117
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:23,570
who I suspect is sleeping off
one of her legendary hangovers.

118
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,615
And where is David's mother,
if you don't mind my asking?

119
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,079
Laura was lost at sea...

120
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,539
when David was 5.

121
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,295
He's had a rather difficult time
accepting her passing.

122
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,300
I brought Dr. Hoffman here
to work with him for a month.

123
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,347
That was three years ago.

124
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,435
There are just a few questions,
if you don't mind...

125
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,979
that were not on the application.

126
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,815
Of course.

127
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,071
How do you feel about the president?

128
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,280
Never met him.

129
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,285
The war?

130
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,246
I don't watch television.

131
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,250
Do you think the sexes should be equal?

132
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,335
Heavens, no.

133
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,421
Men would become unmanageable.

134
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,050
I think we'll get along just fine,
Ms. Winters.

135
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,262
Vicky. Please, call me Vicky.

136
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,184
Carolyn.

137
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,523
Carolyn, this is Ms. Winters.

138
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,569
Sick of hanging around your pad

139
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,362
You're from New York?

140
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,281
I am.

141
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,825
What's Manhattan like?

142
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,702
I'm going to live there when I'm 16.

143
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,539
Carolyn has a fantasy
that I'm going to allow this.

144
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,209
And Mother has a fantasy
I won't run away if she doesn't.

145
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,879
So you're here to babysit the loony.

146
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,548
What have I told you
about using that word?

147
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,842
I'm here to teach David.

148
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,385
Good luck.

149
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,054
None of the others
have made it past a week.

150
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,390
Ms. Winters.

151
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,185
Please, call me Vicky.

152
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,414
Chop-chop, Willie, I'm starving.

153
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,752
And God help me
if it's another bone-dry pot roast...

154
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,379
Who's this?

155
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,257
Ms. Winters, this is my brother, Roger.

156
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,886
Roger, Ms. Winters
is to be David's new governess.

157
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,554
Please, call me Vicky.

158
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,098
It's nice to meet you.

159
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,561
Yeah. Yeah. Nice to meet you.

160
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,732
That it's strange

161
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,235
You're a liar.

162
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,615
I can tell, you know.
Just from a person's face.

163
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,117
Yours says:

164
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,205
"I might look sweet and innocent,
but I have secrets.

165
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,458
Secrets that'll make the hairs on your arms
stand straight up."

166
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,876
Leave her be, Julia.

167
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,963
You're the doctor.

168
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,550
Yeah. And you're "the nanny,"
and she's "the bitch."

169
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,178
How do you ever expect us girls
to advance...

170
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,973
if we keep reducing each other
to labels?

171
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,935
So, Vicky, where'd you c...?

172
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,313
Carolyn!
Will you please turn that noise down?

173
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,672
David, this is Vicky.

174
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,758
She's going to be your new governess.

175
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,968
You ruined it!

176
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,178
I was gonna scare her.

177
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,974
Damn it. What have I told you
about cutting holes in the sheets?

178
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,684
Those are Egyptian cotton.

179
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,353
I was gonna scare you.

180
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,730
Were you scared?

181
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,315
Terrified beyond belief.

182
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,528
You don't have to be nice to him
just because he's nuts, you know.

183
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,530
Carolyn...

184
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,783
Carolyn touches herself.
She makes noises like a kitten.

185
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,202
- David.
- You little shit.

186
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,038
Carolyn. Enough, both of you.

187
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,712
If I may, what is the family business?

188
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,717
Seafood, Ms. Winters.
We had a large cannery in town.

189
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,886
We still own a few fishing boats.

190
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,263
Rusty old boats that no one will hire.

191
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,849
And David's mother's at the bottom
with one of them.

192
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,684
Carolyn, go to your room.

193
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,067
Everybody in this house tiptoes
around him, but no one cares how I feel!

194
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,325
She didn't die.

195
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,827
- She can't.
- Enough, David.

196
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,040
Yes, David believes his mother
has some kind of...

197
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,417
cyclical immortality.

198
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,211
Fascinating, really.

199
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,588
I feel her.

200
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,423
She talks to me.

201
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,592
All the time.

202
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,553
Well...

203
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,098
I think ghosts are just people...

204
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,101
who've moved into
a slightly different dimension than ours.

205
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,979
And I think some people just have
antennas strong enough to pick them up.

206
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,275
There's actually scientific evidence
to support...

207
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,944
Thank you, Ms. Winters.

208
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,043
David, you startled me.

209
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,380
Getting ready for Halloween?

210
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,697
He's coming.

211
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,676
We hit something.

212
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,720
Let's dig it out.

213
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,142
Get down here.

214
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,399
What the hell is this?

215
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,693
Think it's a gas main?

216
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,196
Not supposed to be any out here.

217
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,993
You've gotta be shitting me.
Grab me some bolt cutters.

218
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,098
Jesus!

219
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,770
Run!

220
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,636
I am terribly sorry.

221
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,098
You cannot imagine how thirsty I am.

222
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,328
Mephistopheles.

223
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,676
Show yourself, Satan!

224
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,804
Mock me not
with your strange luminance!

225
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,623
Curious terrain.

226
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,048
What is this?

227
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,634
Some specter approaches.

228
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,805
It is the eyes of the devil himself,
come to drag me to my judgment.

229
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,559
Have at me, Lucifer.

230
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,353
My soul is prepared!

231
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,567
Asshole!

232
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,156
My beloved Collinwood.

233
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,284
What have they done to you?

234
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,589
I'll keep on drinking and trust my...

235
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,966
Hi, pumpkin.

236
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,513
Fear me not, drunkard.

237
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,973
You shall not be harmed...

238
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,935
so long as you tell me
all that I need to know.

239
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,189
Well, here's all you need to know.

240
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,859
See me, derelict.

241
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,530
Look into my eyes...

242
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,700
and deliver me
your innermost thoughts.

243
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,458
Awaken.

244
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,669
Well done.

245
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,839
Now, tell me, the Collins family...

246
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,133
do they endure?

247
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,302
A-yuh. There's four of them.

248
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,555
Thank heaven.

249
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,141
Pray, what month is it?

250
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,644
October. That's why there's pumpkins.

251
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,814
- What is the year?
- '72.

252
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,233
Wait. '71.

253
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,069
A-yuh, 1972.

254
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,948
1972?

255
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,577
Hear me, future-dweller.

256
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,038
You shall be my loyal servant...

257
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:51,377
until such time as I release you.

258
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,257
So, what first, master?

259
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,260
You will cleanse me, miscreant.

260
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,430
And then you will take me
to these living Collinses you speak of.

261
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,682
Okay.

262
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,195
Have you ever seen such majesty?

263
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,446
Every day.

264
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,241
The perfect marriage
of European elegance...

265
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,369
and American enterprise.

266
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:33,419
Nine of the finest craftsmen
the world will ever know...

267
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:38,299
lost digit, limb and life...

268
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:42,136
in the process of carving
these glorious pillars.

269
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,892
And they all considered it
worth the sacrifice, I assure you.

270
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:53,397
The opulence and complexity
of this magnificent chandelier...

271
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:58,486
should only be found
in the palaces of nobility.

272
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,073
The fireplace...

273
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:07,662
sculpted entirely of the most
exquisite Carrara marble...

274
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,790
from Firenze, Italia...

275
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:16,504
each joint containing a single pearl.

276
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,469
Are you stoned or something?

277
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,640
They tried stoning me, my dear.

278
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,100
It did not work.

279
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,647
When did they start allowing
women of the night on estate grounds?

280
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,440
Carolyn.

281
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,860
- Look.
- Yes.

282
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,029
Uncanny, is it not?

283
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,782
Worth every hour I spent posing.

284
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,787
Forgive me.
My name is Barnabas Collins.

285
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,332
I'm David Collins.

286
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,918
- Are we...?
- Related?

287
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,628
Distantly, you might say.

288
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,717
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Master David.

289
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,343
Children!

290
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,345
Get away from that man.

291
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,473
He says his name is Barnabas Collins.

292
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,684
And I'm pretty sure
he called me a hooker.

293
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,603
That'll do, Carolyn.

294
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,734
A word, please.

295
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,990
If this is some kind of a joke,
consider it played.

296
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,328
If it's money you're after,
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

297
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,206
But whoever you are, you're not to look
at those children again. Am I clear?

298
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:42,006
Your devotion to family...

299
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,759
is admirable, madam.

300
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,135
And your suspicion...

301
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,513
understandable.

302
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,351
A stranger arrives...

303
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,937
claiming to be a distant relation.

304
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,733
The question of motive
is to be expected.

305
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,614
As a Collins...

306
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:13,079
surely you are aware of the darkness
that has long plagued our family.

307
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,874
You mean our curse.

308
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:21,670
Witches, ghosts and vampires.

309
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,673
Myths.

310
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,137
And like so many before you...

311
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,890
I suppose you're here
to rid us of them.

312
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,809
For a price, of course.

313
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,190
- I can prove that I am different.
- Oh?

314
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,610
Firstly, I do not come seeking money.

315
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,279
Rather, to provide it.

316
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,657
Secondly...

317
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:54,495
I know the body of this mansion
as well as I know my own.

318
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,206
Every nook...

319
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,667
every corner...

320
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,169
every secret!

321
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,801
That's where I keep my macramé.

322
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,930
A disgraceful misuse.

323
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,891
Impressive.

324
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,689
But there are plenty of old houses
with hidden doors.

325
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,692
I hope you have a "thirdly."

326
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,694
Indeed.

327
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,863
Tell me...

328
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,823
what do you know...

329
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,868
of Barnabas Collins?

330
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,203
Just legends, really.

331
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,457
He was confident and strong.

332
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,376
Admired by all.

333
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,920
But he believed our family was cursed...

334
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,591
and when his parents were killed,
he went mad.

335
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:53,804
Went around insisting that a witch
had turned him into a vampire.

336
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,057
And what is known of his death?

337
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,018
Nothing.

338
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,312
Not that I can think of.

339
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,063
That, madam...

340
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,566
is because he never died.

341
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,839
I am Barnabas Collins.

342
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,429
That means you're...

343
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,974
A vampire, madam. Yes.

344
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,352
And most regrettably so.

345
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:48,526
But more importantly, I am a Collins.

346
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,611
And I give you my word of honor:

347
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:58,077
Neither you nor any under this roof
need fear my cursed nature.

348
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:21,308
My father had quite a flair
for secret passages and rooms.

349
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:28,357
As a boy, I took it upon myself
to discover each one.

350
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,733
But this one...

351
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,862
This one was always my favorite.

352
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:40,202
"Family is the only real wealth,"
he would often remark.

353
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:42,788
Though clearly...

354
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,543
he was not opposed to other kinds.

355
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,505
Oh, my God.

356
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:56,343
We've been sitting on top of a fortune
all these years.

357
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,889
Know this:

358
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,392
I mean to stay.

359
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,771
I mean to be a part of this family again.

360
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,524
On one condition.

361
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,192
Yes.

362
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,570
Promise me that this...

363
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,616
all of this, will remain our secret.

364
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,994
So be it.

365
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,372
Partners.

366
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,965
Welcome home, Barnabas Collins.

367
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,470
I was awakened...

368
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,557
by a yellow dragon with iron teeth.

369
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:49,855
Confronted by a giant letter M
with the luminance of a thousand lanterns.

370
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,816
He's not staying with us forever, is he?

371
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,235
I like him.

372
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,074
Yes, well, I'm sure things
are very different in England.

373
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,703
So, Barnabas, what sort of business
are you in back home?

374
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:09,249
The Collins family has always been
in the fishing business.

375
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,502
But after two centuries
of consideration...

376
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,047
I have decided to devote
the entirety of my energies...

377
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:18,217
to family.

378
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,513
He means it seemed like two centuries.

379
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,766
Morning.

380
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,397
Who the hell is this?

381
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:38,195
Dr. Hoffman, this is our distant relative,
Barnabas Collins.

382
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,239
The Third.

383
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,576
Barnabas Collins lll
is going to stay with us from England.

384
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,788
Barnabas? Dr. Julia Hoffman.

385
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,458
My God...

386
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,253
a woman doctor.

387
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,463
What an age this is.

388
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,800
Is he for real?

389
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,637
I think he's just tired from his long trip.

390
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,433
I see that you have grown
desperate enough...

391
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,310
to sell off the prized
family silverware.

392
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,813
How could you tell?
These are exact replicas.

393
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,315
Had this fork been real silver...

394
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:20,446
my hand would have burst into flames
upon its slightest touch.

395
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,785
Yes, you mentioned
you have a terrible metal allergy.

396
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,874
Anyway, the fishing business
is all but gone.

397
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,793
The manor is nearly in ruins.

398
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,087
Well, I have returned.

399
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,508
And in short order,
so shall our fortunes.

400
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,677
Good luck.

401
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,263
Angie has deals
with most of the boats in Maine.

402
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,348
- "Angie"?
- Angelbay.

403
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,478
They've taken just about every port
on the East Coast.

404
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,190
Then that is where my work begins.
And with your blessing...

405
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,694
I shall restore the family business
to its former glory.

406
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,240
Josette.

407
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,368
That's Vicky.

408
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,537
She believes in ghosts, like me.

409
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,878
Hi.

410
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,049
Enchanted.

411
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,802
Surely you do not let them
call you "Vicky."

412
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,847
A name like Victoria is so beautiful...

413
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,976
I could not bear to part
with a single syllable of it.

414
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,896
Yeah, well...

415
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,816
money might grow on trees
where you're from...

416
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,485
but it's a little
harder to come by here.

417
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,695
Do not concern yourself
with my methods.

418
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:48,075
I should like to see the factory immediately.
How soon can the horses be ready?

419
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,828
We don't have horses.

420
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,038
We have a Chevy.

421
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,504
Hey, Angie, have a great day!

422
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,549
- Morning, Angie!
- Hi, Angie!

423
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,425
Morning!

424
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:38,417
One of the seamers blew a clutch.
It'll be two hours before it's back online.

425
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,503
Make it an hour.
And start cracking the whip out here.

426
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,298
Everybody looks like
they're moving at half speed today.

427
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:48,594
Tell you the truth, I think they're a little
spooked about what happened last night.

428
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,470
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you hear?

429
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,849
They found 11 workers dead in the woods
off Route 9 this morning.

430
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,309
Well, accidents happen.

431
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,855
It wasn't an accident.
Some maniac ripped their throats out.

432
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,150
Where off Route 9?

433
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:12,159
Yeah, Helen, it's me. Yeah, you heard me right.
It's carnage here.

434
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:33,805
All right! I heard you the first 20 times.

435
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,099
Keep your damn panties...

436
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,020
- ...on.
- I'll do my best.

437
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,314
A word with Barnabas Collins, please.

438
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,150
Oh, he's... Who?

439
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,028
Oh, I think you know who.

440
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,697
Black hair, handsome features.

441
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,867
Strange clothes covered in fresh blood.

442
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:06,171
My, we've let this place go to hell,
haven't we?

443
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,549
Right where it belongs.

444
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,684
You must be Carolyn.

445
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,186
You're like a hungry tiger

446
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,815
We're growing into
quite the fetching creature.

447
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,191
Angelique.

448
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,818
Elizabeth.

449
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,240
You're looking well.

450
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,535
And to what do we owe the pleasure?

451
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:41,999
I'm here on behalf of the town council
to welcome our new visitor to Collinsport.

452
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,835
He's asleep, I'm afraid.

453
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,171
During the day? How odd.

454
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,717
What was that infernal banging?

455
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,719
Barnabas, we have a guest.

456
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,430
My apologies, madam.
I have just arisen.

457
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,765
You must think me a fright. Miss...?

458
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,434
Hello, Barnabas.

459
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,273
My name is Angie Bouchard.

460
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,026
So it is.

461
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,531
Do you know what I would very much
like to do with you?

462
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,409
I can only imagine.

463
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,621
I would very much like to have a word
in the drawing room.

464
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,083
With your permission, Elizabeth.
Would you excuse us?

465
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,838
How dare you defile my manor
with your noxious...?

466
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,392
It's really you.

467
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:48,648
How dare you place
your wicked lips upon me?

468
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,610
I remember this place
being less depressing.

469
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:58,200
I also remember the two of us
having a lot of fun.

470
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,409
Here...

471
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,580
and...

472
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,375
here.

473
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,754
Have you any idea
what you put me through?

474
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:14,925
You killed the woman I love
and cursed me to be this hideous creature.

475
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,843
Barnabas, get over it.

476
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,846
Locked in a box for 200 years!

477
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:24,184
Don't exaggerate, it was only 196.

478
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,269
It was an eternity.

479
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,982
I shall have you tried for witchcraft
and burnt at the stake.

480
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,529
Poor, sweet Barnabas.

481
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,533
Things have changed
while you were taking your little nap.

482
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,996
My Angelbay is Collinsport now.

483
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,376
So you are the one who has sent
the Collins family business into the abyss.

484
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,253
They love me here.

485
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,965
I'm the only big fish left
in their little pond.

486
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,842
Is that so?

487
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,220
And do the good people of Collinsport
know that their beloved Angie...

488
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,222
is a whore of Beelzebub?

489
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:06,893
Do you really think anyone
would believe a word you said?

490
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,647
I've been an upstanding member
of this community for 200 years...

491
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,316
in one form or another.

492
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:18,947
Your name may have changed,
but you remain the succubus of Satan.

493
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,158
Harlot of the devil. Vulgar...!

494
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,414
The people of Collinsport
are my worshippers now.

495
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,915
And to them...

496
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,252
you're just a stranger
who's afraid of the sun.

497
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:39,593
Welcome back to the shadows,
Barnabas Collins.

498
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,928
I've missed you.

499
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,607
Angelbay.

500
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:58,278
The very audacity of the name summons
vomit into the recesses of my mouth.

501
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:03,116
I always knew there was something off
about Angie. But a witch?

502
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,910
Indeed.

503
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,788
But a witch with
an impenetrable hatred of me.

504
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,373
Hate?

505
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,919
No, if she merely hated you,
she would've killed you.

506
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,297
A curse takes devotion.

507
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,924
Why must I alone...

508
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,595
bear the rotten fruit
of our cursed family tree?

509
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,307
My parents, taken.

510
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,980
My true love, taken.

511
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,900
And what did you do?

512
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,489
I attempted to throw myself from a cliff.

513
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,158
Tragically, to no avail.

514
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,118
And then...

515
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,330
I became a vampire...

516
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:54,626
and started to kill
innocent townspeople.

517
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,007
Yes...

518
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,970
but you also kept
the family business afloat...

519
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,306
and tried to keep the manor
from falling apart.

520
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,768
Yes.

521
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,353
Yes, I did, didn't I?

522
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,815
You fought on, Barnabas.

523
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:22,529
In your own crazy and miserable way,
you fought on...

524
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:26,199
until they had to drag you away
and lock you in an iron box...

525
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,035
- ...to keep you from fighting.
- My God, you're right.

526
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,538
You fought on
because it's in your blood.

527
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,999
In our blood, madam.

528
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,210
And now you have a chance
to fight again.

529
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,923
And fight I shall.

530
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:35,453
Just the same for you and me

531
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,999
All I need will be mine if you are here

532
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,752
I'm on the top of the world looking down

533
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,423
What sorcery is this?

534
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,302
Reveal yourself, tiny songstress!

535
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,205
You want fishermen,
you gotta get Silas Clarney first.

536
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,625
He's got the ear of every captain
from Bar Harbor to Boston.

537
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,920
They call him the
"Godfather of the Grand Banks."

538
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,840
Excuse me. Captain Clarney?

539
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:19,474
Captain Clarney,
I'd like you to meet Barnabas Collins.

540
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,769
"Collins"?

541
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:27,273
And why does a Collins
want to talk to me?

542
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,782
To offer you a contract.

543
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,742
I have a contract...

544
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,452
with Angelbay.

545
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,414
And if I told you
I could offer you a better one?

546
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:49,212
Then, Mr. Collins, I would tell you
to take a long walk off a short pier.

547
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:54,717
There is such a thing as loyalty
in our line of work.

548
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,470
I see.

549
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,473
Mr. Clarney...

550
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,896
you have grown rather weary
of working for Angelbay.

551
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:12,402
In fact, you would rather
sell your soul to Satan...

552
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,655
than sell another fish
to Angelique Bouchard.

553
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,157
Do you understand?

554
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,327
I...

555
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,329
understand.

556
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,373
Very good.

557
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,750
Now...

558
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,670
if you would be so kind
as to introduce me...

559
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,339
to some of your fellow captains...

560
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,237
Barnabas? Why are you
staring into Carolyn's room?

561
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,907
What is that thing?

562
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,242
It's a lamp.

563
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,121
It looks like a pulsating blood urn.

564
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,750
I think it's time I showed you
my office, Barnabas.

565
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,878
Do you know what a psychiatrist is?

566
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,422
Regrettably, the word is foreign to me.

567
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,218
May I assume it is some species
of American delicacy?

568
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,264
It's a medical doctor that specializes
in disorders of the mind.

569
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,810
I'm a psychiatrist.

570
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,438
Now, where were you born?

571
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:16,067
- Liverpool.
- Can you describe it for me?

572
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:17,777
Filthy.

573
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,279
The air is choked with soot
and the streets reek...

574
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,573
of freshly hurled chamber pots.

575
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,785
The smell of urine permeates the air.

576
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,456
Have you any experience
with hypnotism, Barnabas?

577
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,710
I find it very useful, yes.

578
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,795
Yes, I agree.

579
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,715
You see...

580
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:44,137
sometimes we make up
a fantasy world...

581
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,973
to help us erase horrible memories
from our past.

582
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,060
I find hypnotism cuts through all that.

583
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,481
I employ it for other purposes.

584
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,900
May I hypnotize you, Barnabas?

585
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,611
Madam...

586
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,490
I do not believe that remotely possi...

587
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,454
Good.

588
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,167
Now...

589
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,253
I'd like you to tell me a few things.

590
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,673
A vampire?

591
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,051
Keep your voice down.

592
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,596
What on earth are you talking about?

593
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,725
Oh, spare me.
I had him under hypnosis for hours.

594
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,351
Barnabas?

595
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,188
There's a point where delusions fail,
but his didn't budge.

596
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,939
He told me everything...

597
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,817
including that you've known
his secret since he arrived!

598
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,779
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was protecting the children.

599
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,948
Oh, by letting a vampire
use one of the guest bedrooms?

600
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,826
He admitted killing those men
at the construction site.

601
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,496
- He's a murderer.
- He's a Collins and a good man...

602
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,957
and these days,
that's a desperately rare combination.

603
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,835
Oh, yes, I almost forgot,
the family that can do no wrong.

604
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,171
You know, Julia, I'm surprised at you.

605
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:05,510
I'd think a physician like you
would find him fascinating.

606
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,304
Well, sure.

607
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:13,476
Medically, psychologically
and physically, he's fascinating.

608
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,896
Which is exactly why I came to you
instead of the police.

609
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,482
Then be fascinated, Julia.

610
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:24,403
And if you have an ounce of love
or respect for this family...

611
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,405
keep your mouth shut.

612
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:30,243
I don't feel comfortable
discussing this with you.

613
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,119
Do not fear, my child.

614
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:36,833
I simply seek advice on the art
of courting a woman of this time.

615
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,042
Land.

616
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,421
And who better to tutor me
than a woman of your age.

617
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,257
What is your age, if I may?

618
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,886
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen and no husband.

619
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,597
You must put those birthing hips
to good use at once...

620
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,101
lest your womb shrivel up and die.

621
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:56,936
You're weird.

622
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:01,274
But do you think me too weird
for a woman of this...

623
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,441
land?

624
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,902
You obviously mean Vicky.

625
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:12,577
She has the most fertile birthing hips
I have ever laid eyes upon.

626
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,954
You're way too weird.

627
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,956
Do you really think so?

628
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:21,043
You're all stiff, proper and old-fashioned.

629
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,338
And Victoria...

630
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,925
is she not proper?

631
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,679
She likes to pretend she's rock 'n' roll.

632
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,390
She's a Carpenters kind of chick for sure.

633
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:39,228
Do you mean to say that she has
a penchant for woodworkers?

634
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,564
The Carpenters are musicians, stupid.

635
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,817
Music.

636
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:49,155
Yes, I'm rather fond
of the music of the day.

637
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,993
I am a picker

638
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,787
I am a grinner

639
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,998
I am a lover

640
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,169
And I am a sinner

641
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,338
I play my music

642
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,049
In the sun

643
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,346
If only Shakespeare
had been as eloquent.

644
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,222
Okay.

645
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,060
If you wanna get with her, you're
gonna have to change your approach.

646
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,562
Drop the whole weird
Swinging London thing...

647
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,106
and hang out
with a few normal people.

648
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,823
You know what's good
about this war, man?

649
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,241
- What?
- No way, man.

650
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,535
No, no, no, listen up.

651
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,704
What's good about this war...

652
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,998
is that it's so bad...

653
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,459
it's gonna be the last one.

654
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,836
- Yeah.
- The last one.

655
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,131
And this last war we're in the middle of...

656
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,467
who wins?

657
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,807
- Peace wins, man.
- Yeah.

658
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:01,686
- Peace wins every war.
- Yeah.

659
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,438
- Every war.
- Yeah.

660
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:10,194
- You speak of peace.
- Yeah.

661
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,534
I have spent the last two centuries
locked in a box...

662
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,997
staring into the all-consuming void.

663
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,001
The dark shadows of one's soul.

664
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,420
That's heavy, man.

665
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:32,842
Man, you tripped for two centuries?

666
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,885
Indeed.

667
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,847
But with great purpose, methinks.

668
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:43,936
For I believe that I have found
my one true love.

669
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,940
Alas, I know not how to win
her tender affections...

670
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:52,111
for I fear that I am
a relic in her eyes.

671
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,947
- That's what they say about us.
- Yeah.

672
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,784
Where I'm from...

673
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:03,289
the love of a woman is won
by giving money to her father.

674
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,834
Or sheep.

675
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,629
And if the love is earnest enough...

676
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,467
then perhaps even
a combination of the two.

677
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,846
Women don't care about money...

678
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,931
or sheep.

679
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,767
Yeah.

680
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,977
Are you absolutely certain?

681
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,230
Love.

682
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,649
Chicks dig love, man.

683
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,111
Yeah.

684
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,696
Yes.

685
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,823
I am reminded of a line...

686
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:42,495
from Erich Segal's wonderful novel,
Love Story.

687
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:48,125
"Love means never having to say...

688
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,252
you are sorry."

689
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,423
That is so beautiful.

690
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:59,970
However, please know
that it is with sincere regret...

691
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:05,184
that I must now kill all of you.

692
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,520
Yeah.

693
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,032
No, it's brilliant.

694
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,867
Theoretically, anyway.

695
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,371
A series of transfusions
to try and purify your blood.

696
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:29,083
And my soul with it.

697
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:34,213
I should warn you, Barnabas,
there's a slight chance it won't work.

698
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,341
It isn't exactly the kind of thing
they teach in medical school.

699
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,426
You must have faith, doctor...

700
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:44,098
for if a man can become a monster,
then a monster can become a man.

701
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,225
But why become a man, Barnabas?

702
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,019
Why give up the gift of eternal youth?

703
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,064
Look at me. Every year I get half as pretty
and twice as drunk.

704
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,734
If that is true, madam...

705
01:00:55,902 --> 01:01:01,031
you must have started as the most
beautiful creature that has ever lived.

706
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:07,913
Barnabas...

707
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:12,418
are you aware of the concept
of doctor-patient confidentiality?

708
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,753
No.

709
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,423
Perhaps you would be kind enough
to enlighten me.

710
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,926
All right.

711
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,941
Barnabas!

712
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,277
Victoria.

713
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,613
Mind if I tag along?

714
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,073
Nothing would make me happier.

715
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,451
You've come down for a stroll?

716
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,912
Actually, I came down looking for David.

717
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,997
God knows where he's run off to now.

718
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:53,167
We'll be lucky if we see him
before Christmas.

719
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,960
He's a fine lad.

720
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,547
Every bit as curious and rambunctious
as I was.

721
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,300
He idolizes you.

722
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,638
Between you and his mother, I can hardly
get him to talk about anything else.

723
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:11,310
You believe him, that he sees her
and speaks to her?

724
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,899
Part of me believes he's a lonely boy
looking for comfort.

725
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,946
Part of me believes there are things
in this world we don't understand.

726
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:26,867
Things like magic, death, destiny.

727
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,997
I guess as long as it makes him happy,
what does it matter what anyone believes?

728
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,835
Eloquently put.

729
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,507
Maybe we're getting too worked up
about this, Angie.

730
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,677
They spruced up the cannery
and renovated their house. So what?

731
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:49,390
We still hold pink slips on 95 percent
of the nets dragging the Grand Banks.

732
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,766
He's right.

733
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,644
It doesn't mean anything
to our bottom line.

734
01:02:54,020 --> 01:03:01,443
"Doesn't mean anything"?

735
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,365
My great-great grandmother
started Angelbay...

736
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:12,246
to show those Collins
that they didn't own the water.

737
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:16,458
That they couldn't look down
their entitled noses at us.

738
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,170
The Bouchard women slaved
for over two centuries...

739
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:24,049
sacrificing their lives
to build this business.

740
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,886
So that means something, gentlemen.

741
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:32,391
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna see it
destroyed by those bastards.

742
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,062
Call and arrange a meeting.

743
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,240
Sell to you? Never.

744
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:53,412
One cannot put a price on the restoration
of a family's honor.

745
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,706
Let me try.

746
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:06,425
I had no idea that my business acumen
was giving you such spasms.

747
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:10,763
Hypnotizing fishermen
isn't business acumen, Barnabas.

748
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,015
Those are my terms.

749
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,725
Here are my terms:

750
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,353
Goest thou to hell, and swiftly, please.

751
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,441
And there may Asmodeus himself
suckle from your diseased teat.

752
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,944
No one talks like you any more,
Barnabas.

753
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,614
Yes, indeed.

754
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,826
I must say this age
does remain a mystery to me.

755
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,955
Give me one good reason
why I should not kill you this instant.

756
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,708
Because I'd kill you if you tried.

757
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,294
Impossible.

758
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,922
That would require mercy.

759
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,383
Instead, you have made me a monster.

760
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,301
We're both monsters, Barnabas.

761
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,848
Just two big fish in an itty-bitty pond.

762
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:59,395
Now, we can either fight
until one of us is dead...

763
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:03,857
or we can make...

764
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,445
little fish together.

765
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:15,536
I'll be honest. I was really angry at you
for the first century or so.

766
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,998
Sure, it was fun...

767
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:24,128
watching your family squirm
and burn away...

768
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:27,339
like ants under a magnifying glass.

769
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:32,010
And yes, it was fun being adored
as the Collins name crumbled...

770
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,222
growing wealthy on the backs
of their despair.

771
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,391
But lately...

772
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:41,019
Lately it's just been...

773
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,021
lonely.

774
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,526
We're different from
these people, Barnabas.

775
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,862
We're better than they are.

776
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,324
That's why I've missed you.

777
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:58,704
You're the only ant I couldn't...

778
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,956
burn.

779
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,876
What is it you want, Angelique?

780
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,043
Your love.

781
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,213
You do still love me, don't you?

782
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,383
Somewhere deep down in that cold,
un-beating heart.

783
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:17,055
My dear, even Aphrodite herself
could not construct a more odious union.

784
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,390
What if I made you?

785
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,017
With what, a spell?

786
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,644
A little doll filled with pins?
That is not love.

787
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:26,315
- With this.
- Oh.

788
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,319
The body you once begged me for.

789
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,697
I must admit,
they have not aged a day.

790
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,949
I'm willing to start over, Barnabas.

791
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:40,245
I'm willing to call a truce
if you'll just take me.

792
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,750
I am not as I once was.

793
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,752
I could change that.

794
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,004
And if I refuse?

795
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,882
I'll take everything you love...

796
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:56,094
starting with that little creature
you've been eyeing so fondly.

797
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,848
The one who looks like Josette.

798
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,893
Well, then...

799
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:08,524
I suppose strictly
in the name of her honor...

800
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,735
I must now defile...

801
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:15,197
your most intimate
and womanly segments.

802
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:18,594
That was a regrettable turn of events.

803
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,097
You didn't seem to regret it.

804
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:23,307
Yes.

805
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:30,022
Seems that even in death,
I have a weakness for the living flesh.

806
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,357
Especially yours.

807
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,613
What a cold way
to describe something so hot.

808
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,073
Perhaps.

809
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,706
But I cannot succumb to your charms
ever again.

810
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,711
Please, forgive me.

811
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,717
If I can't have you, my love...

812
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,761
I'll destroy you.

813
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,236
Five more minutes.

814
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,906
This is a very silly play.

815
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,866
A werewolf.

816
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,493
A werewolf?

817
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,245
Yeah, well, it's the only station
we get out here.

818
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:29,498
How are we doing?

819
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,960
I do not feel as though
I'm becoming more human as yet.

820
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,218
Give it some time.

821
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:47,099
Time, doctor,
I have an unfortunate excess of.

822
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:55,399
This is my favorite doll, called Lucy.

823
01:09:55,566 --> 01:10:00,320
And my favorite bit about Lucy
is her crazy, crazy red hair.

824
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:02,614
I mean, look at her red hair.

825
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,701
And my second favorite bit about her...

826
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,454
is her nice, shiny, pink bow and...

827
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,957
No! Please! Please, no! Please!

828
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,459
Please, I'm begging you! Please, don't!

829
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:18,338
It's really true! Mommy, Daddy, please!

830
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,966
Mommy! Daddy!

831
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,300
Mommy!

832
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,720
Please, Daddy! Daddy!

833
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,307
Help me.

834
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,668
Help you what?

835
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,428
A what?

836
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,721
A ball.

837
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,681
And a most splendid one.

838
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,683
A ball for who?

839
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,852
For the entire town, of course.

840
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,271
Don't you know the entire town
kind of hates us?

841
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,191
Balls are demonstrations of power.

842
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:24,613
Balls are how the ruling class
remain the ruling class.

843
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,699
Exactly what I've been saying.
This family could use some balls.

844
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:32,537
Indeed. And the Collins family
have always held the biggest...

845
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,331
and the most wonderful balls.

846
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,209
Jesus, can somebody shut the drapes?

847
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,211
You know, Barnabas has a point.

848
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:42,214
It's about time
we threw a little dough around.

849
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,716
Show the peasants
that we're back in action.

850
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:48,637
People don't throw balls any more,
stupid.

851
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,472
Do they not?

852
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,808
They throw happenings.

853
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:57,854
And how, pray,
does one throw a happening?

854
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,231
Well...

855
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,901
first things first,
you'll need a mirror ball.

856
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,195
Whatever that is, we shall have it.

857
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,405
And booze, lots of booze.

858
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,615
Carolyn.

859
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:12,577
We shall have spirits enough
to fill a schooner's hull.

860
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,162
And...

861
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,915
Alice Cooper.

862
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:22,504
I seem to recall an Alice Cooper
from my youth.

863
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,340
Does she reside in Collinsport?

864
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,883
Not exactly.

865
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,220
Well, she shall be our guest
nonetheless.

866
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,357
How do you do?

867
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,609
- Thank you for having us.
- Evening.

868
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,528
Good evening. Welcome to Collinwood.

869
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:50,323
I have to hand it to you.
This is a happening.

870
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:53,076
I guess the only thing missing
is Alice Cooper.

871
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:57,789
Perhaps you should go and acquaint
yourself with the evening's entertainment.

872
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:14,890
I used t be such a sweet, sweet thing
Till they got ahold of me

873
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:20,103
I opened doors for little old ladies

874
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:23,064
I helped the blind to see

875
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:28,153
I got no friends 'cause
they read the papers

876
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:32,073
They can't be seen with me

877
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:37,120
And I'm getting real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

878
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,456
Ugliest woman I've ever seen.

879
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:42,334
No more Mr. Nice Guy

880
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:46,171
No more Mr. Clean

881
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,798
No more Mr. Nice Guy

882
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:54,179
They say he's sick,
He's obscene.

883
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,977
I got no friends 'cause
they read the papers

884
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,687
Master David.

885
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:05,357
Where is the female coat attendant?

886
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,859
My dad's talking to her inside.

887
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,864
But he told me to keep everybody out.

888
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:16,034
I'm sure he did, David.
And you've done a marvelous job.

889
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:20,705
But now I would like you to go
and watch Alice Cooper with the others.

890
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:22,916
But my dad said...

891
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:27,712
Go and watch the Cooper woman.

892
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,561
You were right about this stuff.

893
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:46,231
Nothing but the best for you, pussycat.

894
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,483
Who was the kid?

895
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,237
I have no idea. I never saw him before.

896
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,991
Now...

897
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,410
come here.

898
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,259
Mommy, where's Daddy?

899
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:17,262
He's been gone for so long.

900
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,056
Is he ever coming home?

901
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:39,367
I was gone for 14 days

902
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,997
I could've been gone for more

903
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,624
Whatever are you doing outside,
my dear?

904
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,877
You'll catch your death of cold.

905
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,588
I've caught the only thing
that matters, Barnabas.

906
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,965
Your eye.

907
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,220
I have withheld my tender affections...

908
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,931
fearful that they were unrequited.

909
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:06,478
I've not spoken of my feelings
to another soul.

910
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:10,899
Right. You've only spoken
of my birthing hips.

911
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,277
Yes, well...

912
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:21,284
I don't know why, but for some reason,
I feel like I can tell you anything.

913
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,913
It's like I've known you forever.

914
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,165
Yes.

915
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:31,419
It's almost hypnotic.

916
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,505
Yes.

917
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:34,756
But, wait, no.

918
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:38,968
I have used no such trickery
to summon your ardor, I assure you.

919
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:43,515
I don't know what it is. I just know there's
always been something pulling me here.

920
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,850
Pulling me to Collinsport.

921
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,852
To you.

922
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,191
Oh, my dear Victoria.

923
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,861
- Hath my scent offended thee?
- No, no.

924
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,530
I'm sorry. It's just...

925
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,993
The people I love
haven't always loved me back.

926
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:10,625
My own family sent me away.
Swept me under the rug...

927
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,462
because it was easier than having
a daughter who was different.

928
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,549
Who was cursed.

929
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:21,386
Cursed because I saw things
other little girls didn't.

930
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:27,725
They were the loneliest, most painful years
a child could know.

931
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,521
Now, hold still, Maggie.

932
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,731
This will only hurt for a minute.

933
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,990
But as hard as they were,
I never lost my will.

934
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,034
The need to feel the sun
on my face again.

935
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,752
So I set out in search
of a new home.

936
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,589
A new life, far away from that pain.

937
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:06,598
But even in my wildest dreams, I never
thought I'd feel as happy as I do now.

938
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:11,603
To betray one's own kin,
and because she possesses a gift.

939
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,104
No, Victoria.

940
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,772
It is unforgivable.

941
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:21,112
And your parents deserve to boil
in hell's everlasting sulfur.

942
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:26,284
See my lonely life unfold

943
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:30,413
Since I've gone away

944
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,709
Hey.

945
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,794
Hey, you're not invited.

946
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,715
Hey.

947
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,425
But...

948
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:45,470
Sleeping don't come very easy

949
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,806
In a straight, white vest

950
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:56,272
Should like to see that little children

951
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,608
She's only 4 years old

952
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:01,986
For most of my life,
I've wanted a place where I belonged.

953
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,239
A place where I could feel at home again.

954
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,574
Feel loved again.

955
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:10,286
And I've found that place
here at Collinwood.

956
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,666
And here.

957
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:39,524
We must intensify our efforts.

958
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,943
I have urgent need to be human again.

959
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,194
I can explain.

960
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,363
My God.

961
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,116
You're not using your blood
to make me human.

962
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:52,203
You're using my blood
to make yourself immortal.

963
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:56,708
Yes, but, Barnabas, you have a gift.
It isn't fair to keep it all to yourself.

964
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:00,086
The Collins family took you in,
bestowed their sacred trust upon you.

965
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,963
And you brazenly betray that trust.

966
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,548
I'm sorry.

967
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,133
I just don't want to grow old.

968
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,552
I want to be beautiful again.

969
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,472
- I want to live forever, like you.
- I'm afraid that is out of the question.

970
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:16,561
A stout man contains
some five quarts of blood...

971
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,855
which, if you will forgive the boast...

972
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:22,066
I can consume in a mere
seven and a half seconds.

973
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,902
But you, my dear little wisp...

974
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:28,906
I dare say I shall drink you
to a withered husk in less than five.

975
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:32,076
Please don't kill me. You're a good man.
You're a gentleman.

976
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,412
- Please, forgive me.
- Madam.

977
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:39,542
I am neither good nor gentle,
and I do not forgive.

978
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,728
I should tell you, Willie...

979
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:01,314
if you ever speak a word of this
to anyone...

980
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:04,984
I shall have to kill you
in a most unpleasant manner.

981
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:06,444
Don't worry, Mr. B.

982
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:09,113
I never liked the bitch anyway.

983
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,699
Come on. I know you're here.

984
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,495
Hey.

985
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,497
Beautiful workmanship, isn't it?

986
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:03,251
I was just looking for the...

987
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:04,961
This?

988
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:09,257
There's nothing worth stealing,
I'm afraid.

989
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:13,845
Sadly, Elizabeth uses it
for the badminton equipment.

990
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:16,931
That's what I was looking for.

991
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:22,645
What are you?

992
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,523
I am about to do something so repellent...

993
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:29,026
that it sickens me to my very core.

994
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:35,616
I'm going to give you a choice.

995
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,369
What choice?

996
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:41,122
Either you remain at Collinwood...

997
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:45,376
and devote your every waking moment
to becoming an exemplary father...

998
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:51,507
the father David so desperately
wants and deserves...

999
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,217
Or?

1000
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,344
Or you leave...

1001
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,846
with sufficient money...

1002
01:22:57,014 --> 01:23:01,767
to live your thieving,
selfish life elsewhere.

1003
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,516
Where on earth is Dr. Hoffman
when we need her?

1004
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,101
Indeed.

1005
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:26,727
Barnabas, you're on fire.

1006
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:04,599
I'd like to teach the world to sing

1007
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:09,937
I demand that you release me
from my curse.

1008
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,106
You're late.

1009
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:16,861
What is that?

1010
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,030
The only thing you drink these days.

1011
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:24,910
From where does it come?

1012
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,203
No one you know.

1013
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,372
I promise.

1014
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,464
I knew it wouldn't be long
before you barged in...

1015
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,383
begging me to make you mortal again.

1016
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:43,304
Now that Dr. Hoffman isn't around
to give you your little transfusions.

1017
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:45,806
Yes.

1018
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,809
Yes, it was a shame...

1019
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:52,647
she was called away
on business so suddenly.

1020
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:57,443
Interesting. I don't know many people
who take business meetings...

1021
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,487
on the bottom of the ocean.

1022
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,740
She was a liar.

1023
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,409
She was stealing my blood.

1024
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,703
Aren't we being a smidge hypocritical?

1025
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:11,916
Lying and stealing blood
are things you're rather familiar with.

1026
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:16,087
Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman...

1027
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:20,007
and the workmen and those
very nice, unshaven young people.

1028
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,593
But know this:

1029
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:26,430
With each life I take...

1030
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,891
a piece of my wretched soul dies.

1031
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,729
For I only kill because I'm compelled to.

1032
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,606
Compelled by your witchcraft.

1033
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,441
By your curse.

1034
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,945
Why have you done this to me?

1035
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:44,448
It's a shame.

1036
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:49,745
You know, if you'd just been smart enough
to love me, I would've let her go.

1037
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,581
Speak plainly, snake.

1038
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:56,377
I sent your little girlfriend
over the cliffs once before.

1039
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,338
What makes you think
I wouldn't do it again?

1040
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,430
I'm gonna offer you
a business proposal, Barnabas.

1041
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,808
My final offer.

1042
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,937
Either you agree to rule
this little pond of mine side by side...

1043
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:17,606
partners and lovers...

1044
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:22,445
or I put you back in the box.

1045
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:27,116
I have already prepared
my counterproposal.

1046
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:29,285
It reads thusly:

1047
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:32,580
You may strategically place
your wonderful lips upon my posterior...

1048
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,290
and kiss it repeatedly!

1049
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:19,210
Sleeping flame, I summon thee

1050
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,629
To your form return

1051
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,215
Make the night as bright as day

1052
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,718
And burn, baby, burn

1053
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,162
Wha...?

1054
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:32,449
I've come to realize shutting you
in that box for all eternity...

1055
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,451
might've been a tad harsh.

1056
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,745
So here is the deal:

1057
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:41,500
I'm gonna destroy everything you love...

1058
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:47,423
and you're gonna take some more time
to think about us.

1059
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,470
See you in a couple centuries, lover boy.

1060
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:11,488
Do not dismay, Barnabas.
We shall yet again escape this nightmare.

1061
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:16,076
Perhaps only a few brief decades
this time.

1062
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,332
Oh, hello!

1063
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,542
Hello! I hear you!

1064
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:29,131
Oh, sweet glories be. Whoever you are,
fear not. I will not harm you.

1065
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:32,801
What year is it?
How many centuries have I...?

1066
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:34,720
How long has it been?

1067
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,015
It's been 20 minutes.

1068
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:41,518
Young Master David. How on earth
did you know I was imprisoned?

1069
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,188
My mom told me.

1070
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,273
You probably think I'm crazy.

1071
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:49,693
Young man, I think nothing of the sort.

1072
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,529
Uncle Barnabas...

1073
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:56,200
why do you have ladies' underwear
on your face?

1074
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:59,286
Never mind that. Where is your family?
Where is Victoria?

1075
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,663
I haven't seen Vicky...

1076
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,749
but everybody else is in the town
watching our cannery burn.

1077
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:05,292
We must save them! Hurry!

1078
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:08,253
Master David!

1079
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:12,132
Perhaps you should unchain me first?

1080
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,678
Hank, we need another brigade
out of Portland, quick as you can!

1081
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:17,554
Get these folks out of here!

1082
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:22,267
All right, everybody, stand back!
Please, stand back!

1083
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:25,896
Oh, boy.
Miss Elizabeth's gonna shit a brick.

1084
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,565
Sheriff, we need to talk.

1085
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:32,319
Christ, Angie, I ain't got time for chitchat.
The damned town's burning!

1086
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:37,157
You don't have time for proof that
the Collins family is harboring a murderer?

1087
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,663
Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman...

1088
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:46,500
and the workmen and those
very nice, unshaven young people.

1089
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:50,629
Well, I'll be damned.

1090
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:53,090
And to think the whole town's
named after them.

1091
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:56,093
I'd be willing to bet that Barnabas
has already skipped town.

1092
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:57,970
And I'd be willing to bet...

1093
01:31:58,138 --> 01:32:01,765
that you'll find the corpses of
more of his innocent victims in there!

1094
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:05,185
The Collins family has rebuilt
their business with murder!

1095
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:09,231
Well, I say, not in my town!

1096
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:13,944
There's one of them now!

1097
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:17,614
He's probably the one who started the fire
to cover his boss' tracks.

1098
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:20,743
- Time to go.
- Where you going?

1099
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,062
Willie. What on earth's happened?

1100
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:51,857
Fire. Murder. Angry mob. Run!

1101
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,610
David, go inside.

1102
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,131
Liz...

1103
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:19,051
I'm sorry.

1104
01:33:19,219 --> 01:33:21,345
We're gonna have to take you in.

1105
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:22,763
All of you.

1106
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:24,848
Bill...

1107
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:28,477
the Collins family built this town.

1108
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:32,356
We built it with our boats and our nets.

1109
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:35,025
With our sacrifices and our blood.

1110
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,985
And this is how you repay us?

1111
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:39,154
You've been harboring a murderer.

1112
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:41,490
Arrest them.

1113
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,200
I shall go willingly...

1114
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:47,496
to whatever punishment awaits...

1115
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,206
provided...

1116
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,709
no harm befalls my family.

1117
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,461
Hold it right there.

1118
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,554
And provided...

1119
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:06,515
Miss Bouchard goes along with me...

1120
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:09,143
for she is no less a monster than I.

1121
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,066
Perhaps it is best...

1122
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,235
if we are both destroyed.

1123
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:25,367
Mr. Collins, back off! I'm warning you!

1124
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:33,417
Go on, slaughter me.

1125
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:35,502
Show them what you are.

1126
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:37,087
No.

1127
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:39,381
I shall show them what we are.

1128
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,262
Unh!

1129
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,357
What's that man done to Angie?

1130
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,361
It's not him, it's her.

1131
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,197
She's a witch.

1132
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:09,620
Excuse me.

1133
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,712
You gotta get through me first, lady.

1134
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:28,138
All right, everybody, go on home now.

1135
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:30,140
- Nothing to see here.
- Let's move.

1136
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:31,892
You should've loved me, Barnabas.

1137
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,604
None of this would've happened
if you'd just loved me.

1138
01:35:35,772 --> 01:35:39,441
I should have destroyed you.
You've brought me nothing but misery.

1139
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:41,443
I gave you my heart!

1140
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:42,819
You have no heart.

1141
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,821
You're the curse!

1142
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:47,324
Women are undone by loving you.

1143
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:51,620
Josette, Dr. Hoffman.
And your beloved Vicky.

1144
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:55,999
I command you to release her
from your curse.

1145
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,711
"Command"? You make me sick.

1146
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:02,589
Missed me.

1147
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:11,848
Vulgar, hideous serpent,
I shall deliver you to hell's doorstep.

1148
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:29,157
Get out of my room!

1149
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,059
Angelique!

1150
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,603
Get out of my house.

1151
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,551
Your house?

1152
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,709
Enough trickery.

1153
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:06,797
I worshiped you.

1154
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:08,006
Plagued me.

1155
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:10,967
Adored you!

1156
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:14,346
Despised you!

1157
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,102
Fine.

1158
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:25,065
If Collins blood built this house...

1159
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:28,527
then let us bathe in it.

1160
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,060
Leave us alone.

1161
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,063
Carolyn?

1162
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:52,360
Carolyn, my God.

1163
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:57,324
I'm a werewolf, okay?
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

1164
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:00,827
Woof.

1165
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:35,278
What have you done to my daughter?

1166
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:37,864
Well, Liz...

1167
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:42,035
your perfect Collins pedigree
lacked a bit of substance...

1168
01:40:42,203 --> 01:40:46,289
so I sent the werewolf
who bit Carolyn in her crib.

1169
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:55,131
Just like I made David
no better than a bastard...

1170
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,802
when I sent his mommy to the ocean floor
to have tea with the tuna.

1171
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:02,806
And as for you, my love...

1172
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:07,477
I killed your mother and father.

1173
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:12,857
I cursed your family, my Barnabas.

1174
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:14,985
They kept us apart.

1175
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,862
They never understood, we're the same.

1176
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:20,156
We're meant to be.

1177
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:22,325
Leave him alone.

1178
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:28,498
I think I'll kill you first, orphan.

1179
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,836
David, get out!

1180
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:35,171
Your quarrel is with me.

1181
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:36,965
My quarrel is with all of you.

1182
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:38,925
I'm warning you.

1183
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:40,802
This is your last chance.

1184
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:42,804
Let us go.

1185
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:45,515
And what will you do if I don't,
you little bastard?

1186
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:47,976
Not me.

1187
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,519
My mom.

1188
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:24,471
Go!

1189
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:40,862
David, come on.

1190
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,200
Willie, come on.

1191
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:08,765
So this is how it ends.

1192
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:14,604
So quiet...

1193
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,190
as if you were asleep.

1194
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:23,071
You know, there was a time
when I might have loved you.

1195
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:26,658
We could have spent eternity together.

1196
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,035
We still...

1197
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,204
can.

1198
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:34,124
You never wanted my love.

1199
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:37,502
You wanted to possess me.

1200
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,129
No.

1201
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:42,048
I love you, Barnabas.

1202
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:45,969
You cannot love, Angelique.

1203
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,389
That is your curse.

1204
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,501
Take it.

1205
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:47,030
Victoria!

1206
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:48,740
Victoria!

1207
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,171
She said Widow's Hill.

1208
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,730
What do we do now?

1209
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:23,817
What we've always done.

1210
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,820
Endure.

1211
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,064
I thought I'd lost you.

1212
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:05,942
You have lost me.

1213
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,779
I live in the light, Barnabas.

1214
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:11,781
You live in the shadows.

1215
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:14,784
I'll grow old and die,
and you'll live forever.

1216
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,953
We will find a way, my love.

1217
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:20,540
There's only one way.

1218
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:25,253
No. I will not see you suffer as I do.
Never.

1219
01:46:30,134 --> 01:46:31,301
No!

1220
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:05,168
Oh, Victoria.

1221
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:07,712
My sweet Victoria.

1222
01:47:17,765 --> 01:47:19,515
Victoria.

1223
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,857
Josette.

1224
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:50,296
It is said that blood
is thicker than water.

1225
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:52,256
It is what defines us.

1226
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:54,092
Binds us.

1227
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:56,386
Curses us.

1228
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:59,555
My name is Barnabas Collins...

1229
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:03,893
and my curse has finally been broken.
