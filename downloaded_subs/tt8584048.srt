[phone vibrates]

3
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,021
Who's calling this late?

4
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:26,069
So annoying.

5
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,723
Hello?

6
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,246
Hello? Who is this?

00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:44,392
[phone vibrates]

8
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,048
Hello?

9
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,180
'What are you doing
with my daughter?'

10
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,096
Who was it?

11
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,186
It was your dad.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,753
Shut up!

13
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:58,710
I'm serious.

14
00:00:58,754 --> 00:00:59,972
My dad's dead.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,627
Then

16
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,629
Who was

17
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,241
[choking]

18
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,281
-Hey, you okay? What happened?
-[brakes squeal]

19
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,522
Uhh-

20
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,958
Dark eyes

21
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:16,005
Maybe a hat.

22
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,964
Like this?

23
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,536
No, it was more of a
hood and the mask was red.

24
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,106
Are you sure it was a mask?

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,542
Of course I'm sure.

26
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:32,891
Well-

27
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,415
I mean, you said it was dark.

28
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,113
No human face looks
like what I saw.

29
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,595
I never said human.

30
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:43,772
What do you mean?

31
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:46,166
Fiona

32
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:50,648
Tell me about your father.

33
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,433
I never knew him.

34
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,174
He died when I was a baby.

35
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,566
Well, if he died

36
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,394
then how did he call you?

37
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:04,575
I don't know, maybe it was
somebody pretending to be him?

38
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,540
Do you know what your
father looks like?

39
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,239
Yeah, my mom's got lots
of pictures. He, um...

40
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:17,240
He was tall.

41
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,720
He had dark hair.

42
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,156
How did he die?

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,331
Car accident.

44
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,465
Did they ever recover the body?

45
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
I don't know.

46
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:28,947
Never

47
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,558
recovered

48
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,689
body.

49
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,865
No, I said that I didn't
know, why? Why?

50
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,957
Maybe nothing.

51
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,002
Maybe everything.

52
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,659
Are you going to tell me
what's going on here?

53
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,051
Fiona

54
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,053
I've been researching

55
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,751
abductions.

56
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:53,581
Human abductions.

57
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,757
Reports of people being

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,454
abducted

59
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:58,586
and then returned.

60
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,591
I don't understand.

61
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,814
Abducted means kidnapped.

62
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,251
They're cinnamons.

63
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,387
No, I

64
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,346
I mean kidnapped by who?

65
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:28,616
There are implants.

66
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,705
Little sophisticated devices
that can be placed

67
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:33,055
inside of the cerebellum

68
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,276
to control what person
says and does.

69
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,321
Make them do things.

70
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:42,325
Things that he or she doesn't
necessarily want to do.

71
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,807
Like, kill a person.

72
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,113
Their technology is so advanced.

73
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:52,335
What, the...

74
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,729
The government?

75
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,121
No.

76
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,123
You don't believe in that
conspiracy BS, do you?

77
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,299
Then who?

78
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,304
Aliens.

79
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,526
I mean, you said it
yourself, right?

80
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,790
If the door was locked,
how did he get in?

81
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,489
Maybe it wasn't him?

82
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:16,751
Well

83
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:19,449
He was phone, wasn't he?

84
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,929
I don't know.

85
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,453
Fiona, your father was
obviously taken.

86
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:25,673
as many people are

87
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:29,546
Now his mind is not his own.

88
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,287
Now I ask

89
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
Is such a thing even possible?

90
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,120
Yes, it is.

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,086
Couldn't it just have been
somebody pretending to be him?

92
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:54,484
No.

93
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,358
I'm finished.

94
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,156
This is over!

95
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,592
Don't say anything else!

96
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:17,202
Mom, we were just talking.

97
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,029
Shut it, Fiona!

98
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,596
Okay.

99
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,469
I have the best attorney
on speed dial.

100
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:25,210
You two will be picking
up trash tomorrow.

101
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,085
Ma'am, your daughter
is not a suspect.

102
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:33,001
Don't ma'am me!

103
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,655
You don't scare me!

104
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:35,830
I know my rights.

105
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:36,918
Mom, stop!

106
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,358
Why don't we leave
you two alone?

107
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,055
You can decide if you
want an attorney present.

108
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,927
-We don't need an attorney.
-Oh, we most certainly will.

109
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,797
Cool.

110
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,626
Alright.

111
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,499
Fiona, if you think
of anything else.

112
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,501
My attorney will be
in touch with you.

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,765
Barbara, let's go.

114
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,331
My name is Annie!

115
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,202
Fantastic!

116
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:05,033
Are you okay?

117
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,774
Is he dead?

118
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,689
I just want to make
sure you're not hurt.

119
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,386
Is Dad dead?

120
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,736
That wasn't your father
on the phone, honey.

121
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,608
That was just someone
playing a mean joke.

122
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,479
You're not answering
my question.

123
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,568
And what were you doing out
last night, anyway?

124
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,875
It is a school night.

125
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,529
It's summer.

126
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,922
And I don't like you spending
the night with your boyfriend.

127
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,576
Premarital sex is wrong.

128
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,621
He's not my boyfriend.

129
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,753
Premarital sex is wrong!

130
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,886
I was born three months
after your wedding!

131
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,193
You were premature.

132
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,206
So you're not going to
answer my question?

133
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,515
You already know the answer.

134
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,298
No, I don't!

135
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,343
I don't know anything.

136
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,257
That's right.

137
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:02,525
If it wasn't Dad on the phone,
then who was it?

138
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,179
I don't know.

139
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:08,009
One of your cool new friends?

140
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,619
That's right.

141
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,491
I don't like this new group
you've been running around with.

142
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,188
What ever happened
to your nice friends?

143
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:17,845
Like Aiden or Brayden or

144
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,368
Phladen?

145
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,572
[papers shuffling]

146
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,460
Hashtag nightmares.

147
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:54,115
He's been writing her
letters this entire time.

148
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,555
Your dad's a psycho.

149
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,731
Was a psycho.

150
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:02,906
Is a psycho.

151
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,647
Come on, Stacy.

152
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,344
It's true.

153
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:07,563
Hey, can I see that?

154
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:16,877
Hey!

155
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,834
You're on!

156
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,227
"Coming up next"

157
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,925
"the brutal murder of
a local college student."

158
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,797
"Are children safe in campus--"

159
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,494
"The fuck are you doing?"

160
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,934
Turn it off.

161
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,327
What? No, I want to see this.

162
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,981
Turn it off!

163
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,460
Stacy, come on

164
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:36,766
We've all had enough.

165
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,639
Fine.

166
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:44,687
Clarence was a good friend.

167
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,646
The best.

168
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:47,951
We have to get this guy.

169
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,910
What did the police say so far?

170
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:50,954
I don't know.

171
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,173
They don't know anything.

172
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,044
Hashtag as usual

173
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,655
Man, I want to shoot the police

174
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,093
An email

175
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:01,051
So they're up to date with
the information that we have.

176
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,226
Man, fuck the police.

177
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,532
You know, they're the only ones

178
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,839
standing in a way
of total anarchy.

179
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,928
I can't believe
you would say that.

180
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,059
What does that mean?

181
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,108
Well, what does it mean, Stacy?

182
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,030
Um Fiona?

183
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,467
We've known each other for
a really long time now.

184
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,382
Whatever you need,
anything at all

185
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,558
I'm going to always
be there, okay?

186
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,778
Aww, thanks Phil.

187
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,127
You're such a good friend.

188
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,701
What's up, losers?

189
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:42,789

any more annoying?

Uh, yes.

196
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,514
I think it's cute that you hang
out with your little brother.

197
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,516
Hey, let's get this straight,
I babysit him.

No!

How do you know?

204
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:24,526
That's right, you don't.

205

Good one!

208
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,931
Jessica, you've seen pretty much
every horror movie out there.

209
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:38,845
I guess.

210
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:43,545
Then you should know what's
going on better than any of us.

211
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:46,461
Yeah, what is it, nerd girl?
Don't keep us in the dark.

212

Maybe your pops
is a vampire, Fiona.

Vampires sparkle in daylight.
Did you see him in daylight?

No.

215
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,295
There was a phone
call in The Ring.

216
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:55,905
Have you seen the
Japanese version?

217
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:56,993
It's a lot different
from the American--

218
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:57,907
Gross!

219
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,213

It wasn't a remake!

So Steve-O, when did you want
to do that photo shoot?

224

I don't know if you're
hot enough, Stacy.

Whatever.

Alright, this weekend.
All three of you.

I guess you never really
know your parents.

You just have to believe
what they tell you.

What if we try to
find your father?

238

'We found him.'

248
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,495
And we're bringing him in now.

249
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,932
You assured me that
I could speak.

Gentlemen, this is

See the chap here?

Get your hand off my penis!

This is the bloke got
me on the penis, people!

257
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,388
What are you doing
this to me for?

258
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,173
What's the reason?

259
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,609
What's the charge?

260
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:15,958
Eating a meal?

261

'A succulent Chinese meal?'

00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,963
Oh, ah yes!

263
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,531
That's a good headlock, sir.

I was home at 7PM every night.

273

And I didn't leave
the house after that.

274
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,884
None of this happened.

275
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:16,149
Detective, why am
I under arrest?

276
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:19,021
What, I'm a prime
suspect because

277
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,763
somebody pretended to be
me on the telephone?

278
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,509
You aren't the prime
suspect, Mr. Stephens.

279
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,163
Well, then who is?

280

Mr. Stephens

281
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,300
Let me ask you a question.

282
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,041
Have you ever seen a UFO?

283
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:42,392
No!

00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,177
Are you sure?

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,788
Of course.

Hey, what is this?

287
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,707
Whether you have or
whether you haven't

288
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,491
it's irrelevant, Mr. Stephens.

289
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,754
Doesn't mean that
they aren't out there.

290
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:10,464
I'm not so sure what
you're getting at.

291
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,468

292
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,644
I'm not going to
say it was aliens

But it was aliens.

294
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,522
Aliens.

295
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,438
What about vampires
and werewolves too?

296
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,918
Don't be ridiculous,
Mr. Stephens

297
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,093
Those aren't real.

298
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,268
And aliens are?

299
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:33,139
Yes.

Mr. Stephens

301
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,500
Why do your wife and daughter
think you're dead?

302
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,243
Look, I'm going to
be honest with you--

Let me stop you there.

bullshit story starts with?

Be me.

309
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,434
All my friends say
she was a slut.

310
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:13,875
But they were right.

311
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:17,357
Well, I get a call
a month later.

312
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,621
Crazy slut knocked up.

313
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,449
Feels bad, man.

314
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:23,972
Why didn't you use a condom?

315
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,933
I hate condoms.

316
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,805
I think it feels
better with a condom.

317
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:35,679
Anyway Mr. Stephens,
let me ask you this.

318
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,856
Why were you speaking with an
accent when we picked you up?

319
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,467
Was I?

320
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,121
Uh, yeah.

321
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:47,691
I thought it'd be cool.

00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,084
More menacing.

323
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,220
Yeah, you know what?
It actually was kind of bad ass.

324
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:59,007
'Yeah, we're checking the
phone records right now.'

325
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,444
We'll nail him on something.

326
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,098
But in the meantime

327
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,795
'You're safe.'

328
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,710
He's not getting out
of here anytime soon.

329
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:08,103
I want to see him.

330
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,192
Oh, I'm sorry Fiona.

331
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:11,454
I can't allow that.

332
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:12,977
He's my father and until today

333
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,675
I didn't even know
that he was alive--

334
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,677
Yeah, and probably the guy who
killed your boyfriend.

335
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,200
It's not going to happen.

336
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,506
Listen, if you want,
I can take him out back

337
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,421
and beat the shit
out of him, but

338
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,423

best I can offer.

00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:42,850
What?

374
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,417
I'm kidding, Fiona, come on now!

375
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,157
Seriously, how much longer?

376
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:49,117
I don't know, another hour.
Maybe ten?

377
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,249
[laughs]

378
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,345
I wild each it

379
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,998
That meets their naked.

380
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,004
You know, crossing your
arms won't hide an erection.

381
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,835
Oh my God.

382
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:12,880
Sorry!

383
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,621
Damn, who knew?

384
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:16,927
Brian's packin'
some serious heat.

385
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,538
Man, get outta here!

386
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,975
No, it's okay!
Look, it's gone.

387
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:21,976
You're embarrassing me!

388
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:23,151
Come on, Steve!

389
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,457

I'm gonna run away

396
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,706

Whatever, man.

411
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,411
Seriously, somebody
go check on him.

412
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:53,459
All right, I'll go.

413
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:56,113
But you girls better still
be naked when I get back.

414
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:07,603
Hey Brian, you okay in there?

415
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,891
Does your brother
have any enemies?

416
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:35,544
Come on.

417
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:37,285
It's Fiona's dad.

418
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,765
My dad's in jail.

419
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:41,594
No, it wasn't Fiona's father.

420
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,639
He's not going anywhere.

421
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:46,033
He could, however,
have an accomplice.

422
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,600
An extraterrestrial one.

423
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,430
I wonder who's
going to die next.

424
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:57,958
Hey, wait a second!

425
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,568
No, no, no.

426
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,396
Could be anyone.

427
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,530
No one really knows how
these life forms operate.

428
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:08,098
It's probably going
to be the slutty girl.

429
00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:09,360
Wait.

430
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:11,624
And then, more than
likely, the Oriental.

431
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,930
Can't you protect us?

432
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:14,801
Yes.

433
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:24,201
Well, what should we do then?

434
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,507
Listen.

435
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,509
We're going to get
whoever's behind this

437
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,773
or

438
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:31,861
Or what we have to...

439
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,997
What?

440
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,478

Hello.

444
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,845

00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:08,637
Hello?

450
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,160
Hello!

451
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,032
Listen you little punk!

452
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:15,514
I'm going to find you,
no matter where you are

453
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,167
or what you are.

Seven what?
Seven proxies?

458
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:29,310
Listen, don't give me
this alien gibberish!

Hello!

Hello!

461
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,359
Hello?

462
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:41,975
Who was that?

463
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:50,853
You kids better get home.

464
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,652
Hey guys

465
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:10,351
Once again, I am looking
for a girlfriend.

466
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,613
But now

467
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,832
I got a chest

468
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,442
I got a six pack

469
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,096
and I am back to tell you

470
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,489
no chest, no sex!

471
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,884
So I am back and I am
looking for a girlfriend.

472
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:22,885
Alright?

473
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,150
So if you know a
girl who's single

474
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:30,153
and who can't resist
my sexy body

475
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,590
tag her right now

476
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,984
because I am looking for a girl
to sleep on my body

477
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:36,638
to feel my chest

478
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,118
and to hold hands with

479
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,554
and have sex with me

480
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,991
Because now,
I got a chest

481
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,166
I got a six pack

482
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,517

for a girlfriend.

Phil, I can't find
anything about this mask.

486
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:04,187
The thing is, I can't even
remember what I saw anymore.

487
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,406
Everything's a blur.

488
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,930
Well, you were in shock.

489
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,324

anything either.

494
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,073
What is it?

-I'm here.

'Phil, thanks for always
being there for me.'

You're my best
friend, you know.

498
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:34,653
In fact, you know, I think of
you as more than a friend.

00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:38,134

501
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:40,833
I also think of you as
more than a friend.

502
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:42,704
I think of you like a brother.

503
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:50,712
Have you heard anything
from the police at all?

504
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:51,974
No.

505
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,454
Nothing.

506
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,412
I hate this. We've got nothing.

507
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:57,284
Can't they just trace the call?

508
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:59,068
I hope so.

509
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:02,506

have, otherwise we're totally--

All right, hang on.

picture of the killer.'

Good! You have
more time to study.

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,848
He's totally in love with Fiona.

560
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,545
I don't really know why.

561
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,243
Well, he better
make his move soon

562
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:13,812
because Steve seems
to like Fiona too.

563
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,378
And what if Steve-O's
the killer?

564
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:16,858
I mean, I always thought
he was kind of stupid,

565
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,077
but he is kind of a dick.

566
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,426
Not a chance.

567
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,863
I've known Steve my whole life,
he's harmless.

568
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,038
Then I guess it's one of us.

569
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:24,474
Or maybe it's Fiona.

570
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,215
How well do any of us
even know her anyway?

571
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,566
I mean, she was the only one
there when Clarence died, right?

572
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,046
Now you sound crazy.

573
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,613
No, hear me out.

574
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,833
She's got her abandonment
issues, her dad up and leaves

575
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,313
and her crazy
overprotective mother.

576
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,185
She was in the tub
when Brian died.

577
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:40,795
They were all in there.

578
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,709
Exactly.

579
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:47,671
Look guys, it's not Fiona.

580
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,151
It's not Steve.

581
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:50,326
It's some deranged psychopath,

582
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,893
and until we figure
out who it is

583
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:54,243
we have to stick together
and watch each other's backs.

584
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,462
I'll watch your back.

585
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,767
Hey!

586
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:59,248
Hashtag get a room.

587

What's the matter, Kerry?

588
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,904
Not interested in a little
trick or treating?

589
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:03,992
Now I didn't say that.

590
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:08,170
Whoa... whoa...

591
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,966
Yo, yo, yo, I'm
turnt up in the spot.

592
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,534
My boy, Kerry, and his girl,
Stacy are over here

593
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,536
and Fiona, hey baby girl.

594
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,146
This video is just for you.

595
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,582
Hey, sexy girl.

596
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:17,544

day, baby. All day!

00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:20,851

In your ass!

602
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,770
What do we got here?

603
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,816
Let's see what this does.

605
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:33,821
Did he just tase himself?

606
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:34,953
Mm hmm!

607
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,432
Aw shit!

608
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,478
Steve!

609
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,697
Steve!

610
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,916
Here, help me with him.

611
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,396
No babe, I gotta go.

612
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,701
Library's going to close.

613
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,007
Just help me get him up.

614
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:48,531
No... I'll talk to
you tonight, okay?

615
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:50,446
Yeah, yeah.

616
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,709
Can't believe you even know
where the library is.

617
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,711
Why's Stacy going
to the library?

No replies at all?

Wait, who's that?

634
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:53,950
Who's Violet Pepper?

635
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:54,864
No one.
It's no one.

636
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,649
No, come here, I want to see!

637
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:57,954
She's just some girl.

638
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,391
She emailed me a few weeks ago.

639
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,305
She's cute!

640
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:01,610
She's not that cute.

641
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,308
What, are you kidding me?

642
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,831
Elbows too pointy.

643
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,747
6 out of 10 at best.

644
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,271
She would be lucky to
meet a guy like you.

645
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,533
Any girl would.

646
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,927
She's probably a guy,
using fake pictures,

647
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,277
like 90% of the girls
on the Internet.

648
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,671
No, hey wait, if you
look at this link

649
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,980
She has to record
herself saying that.

650
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:29,421
"The little black dog
jumped over the silver car."

651
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:35,557
She's real.
Wow.

652
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,219
Hmm...

653
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,656
Just got all these cute
girls contacting you

654
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,659
I'm kind of jealous.

655
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:54,228
They're not as beautiful as you

656
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,318
Isn't it weird that we
haven't hooked up before?

657
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:00,800
Why haven't we hooked up before?

658
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:04,151
[awkward laughter]

659
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,893
Ahh, what's going on in here?

660
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,592
Should we leave?

661
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,333
Where's Stacy? I thought
that she was coming with you.

662
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:15,031
She is comin', oh yeah!

663
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:16,555
Easy there, tiger.

664
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,034
Jerk!

665
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,558
Where did you post the picture?

666
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:22,952
On 4Chan and reddit and a
couple of paranormal sites.

667
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:24,345
Did anyone reply?

668
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,347
Not yet I don't think.

669
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,740
Checking right now.

670
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:31,178
[phone vibrates]

671
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,092
Hello.

672
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,748
Hi, hey, hang on a second,

673
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,663
I'm going to put you
on speaker phone.

674
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,754
Okay, we're all here.

675
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:42,929
Can you say that again?

676
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:46,454
Yeah so, we had to
let your father go.

677
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:47,499
Why?

678
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,239
Well, your friend
Brian was killed

679
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,459
while your dad was
in jail, I mean

680
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:52,765
'He couldn't have done it.'

681
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:54,593
How do you know that he
wasn't involved somehow?

682
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:55,985
Listen.

683
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:59,772
We can't just hold someone
without any evidence.

684
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:01,295
'But this is a
good thing, right?'

685
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,603
'I mean, your father
couldn't have done it.'

686
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:06,256
It means your dad's innocent.

687
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,346
Yeah, but now you have no idea
who killed my little brother.

688
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,652
What about the call?

689
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,524
Did you trace the call?

690
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,742
No.

691
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:17,659
Why not?

692
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:19,531
'Why can't you trace the call?'

693
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:22,447
Because we lost
the phone records.

694
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,188
What do you mean, lost?

695
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:26,712
So...

696
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,931
I accidentally the evidence.

697
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:33,371
What does that mean?

698
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,242
Yeah, I accidentally
the evidence.

699
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,070
The whole thing.

700
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:47,385
Listen guys, I, um, I teach
a self-defense class and

701
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:50,953
I don't necessarily believe
you're in any eminent danger

702
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:52,477
But...

703
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,348
maybe stop by.

704
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,394
Couldn't hurt, right?

705
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,134
Okay.

706
00:39:58,178 --> 00:39:59,832
Thanks.

707
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:00,876
I guess.

708
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:03,749
[call ends tone]

709
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:07,143
Slut.

710
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:12,366
Hashtag we're so screwed.

711
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,498
No, we're not.

712
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,674
We'll figure this out.

713
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:17,415
Promise.

714
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,896
If the police can't do anything,
what can we do?

715
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,943
Oh, there has to be
something missing.

716
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:24,683
There's gotta be.

Check this out.

720
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:32,908
Holy wall of text, Batman.

721
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,693
Fuck readin' all that, man.

722
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:38,392
My name is Rav.

723
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,915
I want to meet.

724
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:43,353
I've been following this case
for the past three years.

725
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:45,704
I've attached a video.

726
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,009
This killer seems
to target people

727
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:49,577
with popular videos online.

728
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:57,367
"Here in my garage, I just
bought this new Lamborghini"

729
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,370
"But you know what I like more
than materialistic things?"

730
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:01,371
Knowledge.

731
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,982
In fact,

732
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:05,506
I'm a lot more proud of these
bookshelves I had installed

733
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,989
to hold the 848,331
books that I bought.

734
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:12,687
I read a book a day
not to show off

735
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,124
but again, it's about
the knowledge.

736
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:18,345
And the real reason I keep
this Lamborghini here

737
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,346
is that it's a reminder

738
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:20,608
Oh no.

739
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,262
"A reminder that dreams
are still possible"

740
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:23,524
Because it wasn't that long ago

741
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,744

of it as money anymore.

00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,186
I think of it as fuel units,
and I use those fuel units.

I use these fuel units
to get mentors.

can follow my 67 step program.

can get here tomorrow

but you can get there
faster than you think

752
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:50,377
and you can have knowledge

753
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,161

here in the Hollywood Hills

00:41:52,205 --> 00:41:54,642

your Lamborghinis

01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:49,809
Wait guys!

1111
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,377
Over here.
Come look at this.

1112
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,421
Jess, wait!

1113
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:54,248
Seriously?

1114
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,423
That bitch is so annoying.

1115
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:00,559

Finally.

1119
01:03:24,975 --> 01:03:27,673
Are we really going in there?

1120
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:30,067
Hashtag no one can
hear us screaming.

1121
01:03:36,595 --> 01:03:38,162
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

1122
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,687
No. No, we've come this far
already. Let's see this through.

1123
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,863
Are you sure?
Might not be safe.

1124
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:47,040
Well, we got a bat.
And golf clubs, right?

1125
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:48,650
Back in the car.

1126
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:50,304
Whatever.
Bat's good enough.

1127
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,620
What if he's got a gun?

1128
01:04:14,546 --> 01:04:17,418
Wait, are you sure?

1129
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:18,506
I don't know.

01:04:35,784 --> 01:04:37,569
Fiona, what are you doing here?

1132
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:39,440
What am I doing here?
You're supposed to be dead!

1133
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:40,789
You can't be here!

1134
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:43,053
What, you ain't gonna
invite us in, bro?

1135
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:44,315
Relax, Steve.

1136
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:45,490
Okay, come on.

1137
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:46,708
Get inside.
Hurry up.

1138
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:48,319
Come on.

1139
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:50,495
Just relax, relax! Calm down!

1140
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,907
Don't touch those.

1141
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:13,126
You murder people with
some fancy ass shit.

1142
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,954
Hey, they're strictly
for self defense.

1143
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,173
Of course.

1144
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:17,609
What do you use to
murder people with then?

1145
01:05:20,612 --> 01:05:22,353
I guess I owe you
an explanation.

1146
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:23,571
You think?

1147
01:05:23,615 --> 01:05:27,227
Someone's after me, or,
something, maybe.

1148
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:29,403
And it wants nothing
more than to hurt you.

1149
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,494
I thought if I left,
you'd be safe.

1150
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:36,236
And it worked.
For 20 years it worked.

1151
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,107
Why?

1152
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,720
I was young and stupid.

1153
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:43,896
And I offered myself to be
a host for this entity.

1154
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,767
-Whatever, man.
-A demon.

1155
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:49,902
I just wanted us to have a
good life. The best life.

1156
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,948
But it didn't want me.

1157
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:55,168
My body was too sick and
poisoned from the drugs.

1158
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:56,691
Aww yeah!

Cool story, bro.

1162
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:09,269
I don't believe you.

1163
01:06:09,313 --> 01:06:10,444
I wish I were making this up.

1164
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:12,185
Why would you make
a deal with a demon?

1165
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:13,404
Yeah.

1166
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:16,015
Haven't you seen like
every movie ever?

1167
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,322
I'm paying for the mistakes
I made when I was young.

1168
01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:19,801
I'm paying every day.

1169
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:22,674
I just want to make sure
you're not paying for them too.

1170
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,026
How did it find me?

1171
01:06:28,593 --> 01:06:30,116
-Facebook.
-Dammit!

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,119
I told you! I told you to
change your privacy settings.

1173

1175

Should we leave?

1179
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:45,131
No, it already knows we're here.

1180
01:06:45,175 --> 01:06:47,916

do now is prepare.

1185
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,078
About the privacy thing.

1186
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,949
Fiona should've set
her Facebook to private.

1187
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:22,908
They still could have found her.

1188
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:24,214
How?

1189
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:26,999
I don't know.
I don't know this Internet shit.

it, will you?

No!

1476
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:23,509
Fiona, run!

1477
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:05,899
Oh, this goddam bullshit.

1478
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,999
Fuckin' bugs and shit.

Oh, shit!

1488

You okay, man?

Yeah, yeah

1490

Damn, you okay?

1491
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:45,738
I'll be fine, just put me
in a bag of rice.

1492
01:27:45,782 --> 01:27:47,131
Where's Fiona?

1493
01:27:47,174 --> 01:27:49,351
I don't know, man, I
think she went that way.

1494
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:53,790
Oh my God!

1495
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:54,704
I'll be fine.

1496
01:27:56,836 --> 01:27:58,795
You two, get back to the house.

1497
01:27:58,838 --> 01:28:00,362
No!

1498
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:01,624
I'll find Fiona.

1499
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:07,282
I got this.

1500
01:28:10,154 --> 01:28:12,504
Be careful!

1501
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:14,637
Fiona!

1502
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,507

Wait, it's me!

We have to go!
He's coming!

1509
01:29:33,759 --> 01:29:34,456
Who's coming?

1510
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:35,413
He's out here!

1511
01:29:35,457 --> 01:29:36,414
Who's out here?
Your dad?

1512
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:38,068
What? No, not my fucking dad!

1513
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:39,156
Fiona!

1514
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,592
Calm down.

1515
01:29:40,636 --> 01:29:42,072
Alright, let's just go.
Let's just get out of here.

1516
01:29:42,115 --> 01:29:42,594
Alright?

1517
01:29:42,638 --> 01:29:43,900
Hey! HEY!

1518
01:29:43,943 --> 01:29:45,945
Listen, I'm a cop, remember?

1519
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:48,426
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you!

1520
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,514
Now let's go find your dad.

1521
01:29:49,558 --> 01:29:51,081
My dad is dead!

1522
01:29:51,124 --> 01:29:52,517
That's right, you said that.

1523
01:29:52,561 --> 01:29:53,518
Okay.

1524
01:29:53,562 --> 01:29:54,867

before I put a bullet
in your head?

1533

Spoiler alert!

1534
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:18,238

Aww, shit!

1544
01:31:07,549 --> 01:31:09,855
Hey man,
you okay?

1545
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:10,726
Mmm...

1546
01:31:18,995 --> 01:31:20,518
Look, you're going to be okay.

1547
01:31:20,562 --> 01:31:22,520
Just stay here.
Try not to move.

1548
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:24,261
Where's Fiona?

1549
01:31:24,304 --> 01:31:25,523
I'm going to go find her.

Godammit!

1558
01:32:51,087 --> 01:32:52,349
I'll fucking kill you!

1559
01:32:52,392 --> 01:32:53,437
I'll kill you!

1560
01:33:37,742 --> 01:33:38,961
Just do it already!

Wait!

It's a prank!

1565
01:33:59,677 --> 01:34:01,157
It's a prank!

1566
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:01,723
What?

1567
01:34:01,766 --> 01:34:02,506
Chill, bro.

1568
01:34:02,549 --> 01:34:03,681
It's just a prank.

1569
01:34:03,725 --> 01:34:05,291
There's a camera guy
right over there.

1570
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:08,381
Whoa, back off!

1571
01:34:08,425 --> 01:34:09,078

01:34:14,431 --> 01:34:16,172
Take it easy!

1577
01:34:16,215 --> 01:34:19,566
This was all a prank?

Yeah, it's for my channel.

Aww man!
I knew I knew you!

1582
01:34:36,148 --> 01:34:38,455
I subscribe to his channel!

You're an asshole.

I know.

1589
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:53,862
Alright...

1590
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,039
I'm going to get you
back, you know.

1591
01:34:57,082 --> 01:34:58,388
I know.

Hell yeah, motherfucker!

Hey Brian, get over here!
What's taking so long?

1597
01:38:44,005 --> 01:38:46,094
Hey Fiona.

1598
01:38:46,137 --> 01:38:47,312
Hi, baby girl.

1599
01:38:49,053 --> 01:38:53,101
Everything's okay.
Don't worry about it.

1600
01:38:53,144 --> 01:38:54,102
Everything's okay.

1601
01:38:56,017 --> 01:38:58,193
I love you more

1602
01:38:58,236 --> 01:39:03,981
than there are grains of sand
on every beach, on every planet

1603
01:39:04,025 --> 01:39:06,897
on every galaxy of the universe.

1604
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:11,946
You mean more to me

1605
01:39:11,989 --> 01:39:16,472
than golden diamonds
mean to the greediest

1606
01:39:16,515 --> 01:39:17,821
burglars.

1607
01:39:21,259 --> 01:39:23,479
I hope you enjoy watching
this, baby girl.

1608
01:39:27,004 --> 01:39:28,179
I love you.

1609
01:39:39,799 --> 01:39:42,367
ey, whatever this is... whatever
this is, it's not right.

1610
01:39:42,411 --> 01:39:43,586
What page are you reading?

1611
01:39:43,629 --> 01:39:44,543
The page, the words,
they're right there.

1612
01:39:44,587 --> 01:39:45,675
There's nothing on there!

1613
01:39:45,718 --> 01:39:46,589
There's nothing...
there's no words!

1614
01:39:46,632 --> 01:39:47,938
What - what does it mean?

1615
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,592
What, the other side?
What does that mean?

1616
01:39:49,635 --> 01:39:50,941
Over there.
The other side.

1617
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:52,856
Over there, what?
The other side of the door?

1618
01:39:52,899 --> 01:39:53,465
-Is that where?
-Yeah.

1619
01:39:53,509 --> 01:39:54,379
Yeah.

1620
01:39:54,423 --> 01:39:55,554
Alright. Alright, go, go, go!

1621
01:39:55,598 --> 01:39:56,120
Come on.

1622
01:39:56,164 --> 01:39:57,252
Come on!

1623
01:39:57,295 --> 01:39:58,296
And five

1624
01:39:58,340 --> 01:39:59,254
four

1625
01:39:59,297 --> 01:40:00,124
three

1626
01:40:03,171 --> 01:40:05,521
Fuck, I can't...!

1627
01:40:05,564 --> 01:40:06,652
Fuck!

1628
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:07,784
Fuck it, I can't -
I can't fucking--

1629
01:40:07,827 --> 01:40:09,003
I can't do this!

1630
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:09,655
I can't -
Fuck it!

1631
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:10,395
We'll do it live!

1632
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:11,048
I'll write it!

1633
01:40:11,092 --> 01:40:11,962
We'll do it live!

1634
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:12,658
Fuck it!

1635
01:40:12,702 --> 01:40:14,008
Fucking thing sucks!

1636
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,460
I really admire his work.

1637
01:40:31,503 --> 01:40:33,201
I was psyched when
I got the chance

1638
01:40:33,244 --> 01:40:35,072
to work with him
on this project.

1639
01:40:35,116 --> 01:40:36,465
But, yeah...

1640
01:40:36,508 --> 01:40:38,119
After a while I realized that

1641
01:40:38,162 --> 01:40:40,469
everything might
look spontaneous,

1642
01:40:40,512 --> 01:40:43,559
but careful planning
goes into each scene.

1643
01:40:43,602 --> 01:40:44,777
I didn't realize that until

1644
01:40:44,821 --> 01:40:47,606
I became the one doing
all the prep work.

1645
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:51,697
I mean, I scrubbed that garbage
bin for like six hours,

1646
01:40:51,741 --> 01:40:55,353
and in the end, he
wouldn't even get in!

1647
01:40:55,397 --> 01:40:59,183
So I had to climb in and I got
blamed for breaking the mask

1648
01:40:59,227 --> 01:41:03,970
because I let that guy
punch me in the face.

1649
01:41:04,014 --> 01:41:07,104
It took me three days to
make that goddam mask!

1650
01:41:07,148 --> 01:41:08,975
Three days!

1651
01:41:09,019 --> 01:41:11,848
And I didn't even
get a thank you?

1652
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:14,024
That's where it hurts the most.

1653
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:16,635
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not complaining.

1654
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:20,465
I'm just a camera guy,
after all.

1655
01:41:20,509 --> 01:41:24,208
I'm not asking for
fame or for money.

1656
01:41:24,252 --> 01:41:28,212
All I'm saying is a little
'thank you' once in a while.

1657
01:41:28,256 --> 01:41:29,735
What about the garbage bin?

1658
01:41:29,779 --> 01:41:30,954
What?

1659
01:41:30,997 --> 01:41:32,173
How did you get out
of the garbage bin?

1660
01:41:32,216 --> 01:41:34,131
You just disappeared.
How'd you do that?

1661
01:41:34,175 --> 01:41:36,438
Oh, it's just this
trick that I learned.

1662
01:41:36,481 --> 01:41:37,482
It's very easy.

1663
01:41:37,526 --> 01:41:38,701
Let me show you.

1664
01:44:43,842 --> 01:44:45,975
Yeah, buddy!

1665
01:44:46,018 --> 01:44:48,630
Our video hit two
million views today.

1666
01:44:48,673 --> 01:44:50,806
Oh, we're going to
be so rich, bro!

1667
01:44:50,849 --> 01:44:52,590
'Did we make the Top Ten?'

1668
01:44:52,634 --> 01:44:53,330
'How many do we--?'

1669
01:44:53,374 --> 01:44:56,333
[grunting and choking]

1670
01:44:56,377 --> 01:44:57,116
Hey...

1671
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,814
Hey Mike?

1672
01:44:58,857 --> 01:45:00,511
Mike, you there?

1673
01:45:00,555 --> 01:45:01,469
Hey Mike!

1674
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:07,170
What?
