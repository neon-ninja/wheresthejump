1
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,000
What is this?

2
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,000
Hurry and do it!

3
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Let's get started.

4
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
It's not you.

5
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Did you stay up all night again?

6
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,950
There are only 4 hours left until the deadline.

7
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,890
So dangerous.

8
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,320
You're irresponsibly damaging your body.

9
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,220
Aah, but I guess I work better at night.

10
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,280
Would you like some coffee?

11
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,840
Oh, thank you.

12
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,900
Akane...

13
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,980
Hmm?

14
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Didn't you have a bad dream?

15
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,070
No, I'm okay.

16
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,950
Please wash the rest off.

17
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,430
Yes.

18
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,510
Alright, shall we go?

19
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,600
Yes.

20
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Goodbye!

21
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,720
It was a suicide, right?

22
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,260
Yes, we suspect that.

23
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,710
Is that so? Thank you very much.

24
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,200
Oh, how is it?

25
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,630
Tominaga Tetsuo, 35 years old.

26
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,470
He was a salaryman who lived
in an apartment further down.

27
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,630
According to an eyewitness,
he was sitting on this bench.

28
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,470
Seems he had a PC with him.

29
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,990
And then he suddenly appeared on the road.

30
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,150
Well, it's suicide, isn't it?

31
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,390
Isn't that too much? How
many cases like this have been

32
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
in only our jurisdiction this week?

33
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
How is it?

34
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,660
I don't understand.

35
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,150
Nakamura, do young guys nowadays
commit suicide while looking at a computer?

36
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,440
I don't.

37
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,070
Koiso-san, that man
was holding on to a PC, but...

38
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,030
It looks like some video was playing.

39
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,830
But the video itself didn't remain, right?

40
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,350
He committed suicide
while watching the video, right?

41
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,430
Koiso-san, have you heard
about it? The "cursed video".

42
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,660
Huh?

43
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,350
Lately it has become a hot topic on the net.

44
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,030
It's said that "people who watch it
suffer from a curse and commit suicide".

45
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,320
By any chance, is the series
of suicides these days also...

46
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,160
Nakamura,

47
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,830
are young detectives nowadays
investigating on the Internet?

48
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,660
Properly investigate by foot, will you!

49
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,860
I should, shouldn't I?

50
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,540
Ayukawa-sensei, good morning!

51
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,820
Good morning.

52
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,950
In this kind of entrance
examination, the problem will be

53
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,470
the underline that is attracted
in the expression technique part.

54
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,960
Since I put together the problems that
appeared in the previous exams in a handout,

55
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,760
look through it, okay?

56
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
What are you doing?

57
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,730
I'm searching. For the cursed video.

58
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,040
What?

59
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,030
The "cursed video".

60
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,280
What is that?

61
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,200
Risa, you don't know?

62
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
I don't know.

63
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,910
Somehow, it seems the
person in the video dies.

64
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,300
Jeez, I just don't like this.

65
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,990
And the people who saw that,
suffering from the curse, died too.

66
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,580
That's a lie.

67
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,750
But it's true! Because it
appears on the net pretty often.

68
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,470
Noriko, are you looking for it?

69
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,980
That's right.

70
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,600
Why?

71
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,430
Because I want to see it.

72
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,630
Since the other day I've
always been searching for it,

73
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
but I can't find it, you know?

74
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,390
Again a 404 error.

75
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,240
Is it this? It's here!

76
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,540
You're lying!?

77
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Morisaki-san...

78
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,270
Cellphones are prohibited during lessons.

79
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,760
Cursed video

80
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
What is this?

81
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,910
You die when you watch
it. It's the cursed video.

82
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,300
What's that? Sensei, I want to see!

83
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,150
Sensei, we want to see it! Let's watch!

84
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,270
Hurry, hurry! Play it, play it!

85
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's watch it!

86
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,150
How is the curse?

87
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,190
What, this is totally different!

88
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,520
What is this?

89
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,920
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,790
I'll keep this in custody, okay?

91
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,500
I'll turn off the power supply,
so come and get it after school.

92
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,190
Then, I'll borrow these documents.

93
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Ayukawa-sensei!

94
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,590
I'm sorry about the cellphone.

95
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,510
Morisaki-san's cellphone is strange.

96
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,630
The power supply was cut, but it moved.

97
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Eh? You're lying.

98
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
What is this?

99
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,230
Morisaki-san, don't look
at so many weird sites, alright?

100
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Okay! Goodbye!

101
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Goodbye.

102
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,160
I'm home!

103
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,910
Ah, welcome home.

104
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,230
Enoki-kun, you're here.

105
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,480
Hi.

106
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,430
Hey, because of you I was up all night.

107
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,910
I'd like to sleep.

108
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,160
Thanks for your hard work.

109
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,950
Thanks to you, it was
handed to a successful system.

110
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,400
But, a little longer...

111
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,990
Enoki-kun, what are you doing?

112
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,730
He's looking for it.

113
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,400
For what?

114
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,750
The "cursed video".

115
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Just like a high schooler.

116
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,790
No, no.

117
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,750
That's not just a mere rumor.

118
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,670
It's said there was a
Nico Nico Video live broadcast.

119
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,220
That a guy in some way
made his suicide publicly available.

120
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,880
A suicide live broadcast?

121
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,670
That's right. And, Nico-dou's administrator

122
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,300
(Nico-dou is a nickname for the Nico Nico Video site)

123
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,430
also committed suicide
right after the live broadcast.

124
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,860
Wha... what's that?
That's probably just a rumor.

125
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,150
No, no, no! Since I heard
it from the Nico-dou people.

126
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,660
It's seriously dangerous.

127
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,860
Are you for real?

128
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,860
I am.

129
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,830
Furthermore, some people who were watching
that live broadcast also committed suicide.

130
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,920
"If you watch it, you die."

131
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,910
Exactly like the "cursed video".

132
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,470
It's a "rumor".

133
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,070
Yeah, it's a rumor.

134
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,390
Ah...

135
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,510
Aah! It has been deleted after all.

136
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,190
If there was a live
broadcast video like that,

137
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,190
you probably shouldn't
remain on that site.

138
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,430
Well, that's for certain, isn't it?

139
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,310
I wonder if someone saved it.

140
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,310
Even today it seems to
be upped in a guerrilla-like way.

141
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,070
In my intuition, it
smells slightly different

142
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,990
from the former
urban legend, doesn't it?

143
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,070
It would be seriously dangerous
if an amateur got involved.

144
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,150
Well then, don't search it at my place.

145
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,720
Don't bring anything unlucky into here.

146
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,150
Ah, say Takanori-san...

147
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,990
Hmm?

148
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,830
Did you already tell Akane-san?

149
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,320
What?

150
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,150
No, no, about marriage.

151
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,150
You- Go home already!

152
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,710
Aah, really... I give up, I give up.

153
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,610
Let's get started.

154
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,370
It's not you.

155
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,470
Yes, hello. This is Ayukawa.

156
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,850
Yes...

157
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,150
Morisaki-san is...?

158
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,990
That's...

159
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,620
Ah... I understand.
I- I'll go immediately.

160
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,630
Stop, stop...

161
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,550
There are no lessons today.

162
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,950
Everyone, please return to your homes.

163
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,750
About what to do from tomorrow
on, I'll contact your homes.

164
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,430
Also, about Morisaki-sans funeral wake,

165
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,750
I'll contact you if the details are decided.

166
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,710
Although I'm sorry that this is so sudden,

167
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,950
have there recently been some

168
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,550
changing signs by Morisaki Noriko-san?

169
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,190
Maybe something that worried you?

170
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,230
No, I didn't notice anything.

171
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,430
Even in class she was a bright student.

172
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,370
What about yesterday?

173
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,990
She was taking the lesson pretty normal.

174
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,830
What about after the lesson was over?

175
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,010
Eh?

176
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,760
No...

177
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,430
No matter how trivial the things are,
it's okay. If you remember anything...

178
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Nothing in particular...

179
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,880
I see.

180
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,400
It's just... it's common, isn't it?

181
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,830
Bullying?

182
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,190
There isn't.

183
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,150
It's true.

184
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,950
And if anything
she was a popular person.

185
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,630
Ah, uhm...

186
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,750
Did Morisaki-san really commit suicide?

187
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,110
Actually she...

188
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,820
She broke through the
windowpane and jumped off.

189
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,830
Furthermore, she
still had her cellphone.

190
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,150
It's strange, isn't it?

191
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,590
She still had her cellphone?

192
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,320
Yes.

193
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,670
Apparently, just before her death,

194
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,740
it seems she was watching
a video on the cellphone.

195
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,740
Video...

196
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,070
Kitayama-san.

197
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,030
Sensei, why did Noriko die?

198
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,890
That is...

199
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,830
You talked to the
police officer, didn't you?

200
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,550
The police determined
that it looks like suicide.

201
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,310
Noriko couldn't commit suicide.

202
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,390
That she committed
suicide, I can't believe it.

203
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,640
I can't believe it either.

204
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,430
Maybe Noriko was
killed by someone...

205
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,370
Eh?

206
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,430
Noriko... I think she
saw the cursed video.

207
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,810
Thus, she suffered from the curse...

208
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,930
Something like that...

209
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,070
But Noriko—

210
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,830
She said "I want to see the cursed
video" and was always searching for it.

211
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,720
Kitayama-san,

212
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,750
there is no cursed video.

213
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,710
Then sensei, do you really
think Noriko committed suicide?

214
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,430
I'm sorry, I don't know either.

215
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,790
It's certainly the cursed video's fault.

216
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,750
Kitayama-san...

217
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
It's enough.

218
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,390
Oh, Nakamura! Earlier you
were talking about a rumored video.

219
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,830
You know, the "cursed something".

220
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,630
The source of it,
investigate it just in case.

221
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,590
Idiot, it's just in case! "Just in
case". Why are you so excited about it!

222
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,930
Sorry I'm late!

223
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,710
Akane, are you alright?

224
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,090
Yeah.

225
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,390
That child... is really pitiful.

226
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,110
Takanori... could you get
in touch with Enoki-kun?

227
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,640
Why?

228
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,990
There is a bit I
want to ask him about.

229
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,110
It's bad, Koiso-san!

230
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,550
The cursed video is real!

231
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,440
What?

232
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,230
It exists; the cursed video!
But currently the rumor's source

233
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
was on Nico Nico Video
and came from there.

234
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,380
Calm down!

235
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,950
The people who watched the
live broadcast are really dead!

236
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,920
What does that mean?

237
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,950
The origin of the rumor was
a live broadcast 10 days ago.

238
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,950
The live broadcast was being monitored
and the Nico Nico Video administrator

239
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,630
committed suicide
shortly after the broadcast.

240
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,150
So,

241
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,750
I had everyone who watched
the live broadcast investigated.

242
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,000
Is such a thing possible?

243
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,990
Yes. Because Nico-dou
has a registration system.

244
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,590
Hey, Koiso-san, please
come over for a bit.

245
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,580
Hurry a little.

246
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,470
I tried to investigate those
5 people who saw it in my way.

247
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,870
And then, everyone of the 5
who watched the live broadcast

248
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,910
died at the exact same time.

249
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,520
What was the content
of that live broadcast?

250
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,030
That broadcast's
content, don't you know?

251
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,470
It has been decided, that the rumor was
"a man who publicly committed suicide", hasn't it?

252
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,630
But, on Nico Nico Video

253
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,670
there seems to be
no data of the video left.

254
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,060
No, usually... even if
it's deleted on the site,

255
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,830
all videos are stored on the server.

256
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,470
Then, that video that shouldn't exist

257
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,430
is up on the net even now.

258
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,610
As the cursed video.

259
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,840
Roughly, you can't kill
people with that video, right?

260
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,630
I don't know that.

261
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,350
If you watch it, you'll "subliminal"
commit suicide and are absorbed.

262
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,910
Really?

263
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,390
If you watch it,
you'll commit suicide...

264
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,040
Earlier I tried to check
the agency's database.

265
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,710
Within 10 days after the broadcast,

266
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,870
there were more than 20 similar,
suspicious suicides throughout the country.

267
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,030
And even after the live broadcast
ended, the suicides are continuing...

268
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,280
It's the cursed video after all.

269
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
Absolutely not!

270
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,110
How can a video kill people?
Does poison come out of the PC?

271
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,110
But even if that's the case,
doesn't everything connect?

272
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,390
That man at the bus stop as well as
the high school girl who jumped off.

273
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,430
Nakamura, who is the guy that
aired that initial live broadcast?

274
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,990
A guy called Kashiwada Seiji.

275
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,970
There's nothing, is there?

276
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,090
Is this the only room here?

277
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,740
Yes.

278
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,830
When was the last time
you met Kashiwada-san?

279
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,310
I saw him once 2 weeks ago.

280
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,630
What kind of person is he?

281
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,030
He is a quite person,
with a gentle kind of feeling.

282
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Was there some problem with him?

283
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,760
No, nothing.

284
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,350
The room he is using is clean and

285
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,750
the rent for this month
has been properly paid as well.

286
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,540
It's a strange room, isn't it?

287
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,150
Something is missing. No...

288
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,990
It somehow seems fake.

289
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,450
Fake?

290
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,660
But... isn't everyone
out there a fake?

291
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Can we stay a little longer?

292
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,310
Please. I'll be right over there.

293
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,870
Kashiwada Seiji, attending a significant Shingakko.

294
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,800
(Shingakko: A high school with a considerable
high percentage of graduates that get into college)

295
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
It's a boarding school.

296
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,590
But when his parents passed away,
he voluntarily dropped out of there.

297
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
And?

298
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,280
And...

299
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,390
Kashiwada seems to be
quite famous on the net.

300
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,900
What was he doing?

301
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,190
He's an artist.

302
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,190
He upped Airbrush Art
and stuff on the net.

303
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,880
He's pretty charismatic.

304
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,180
There's also a fan site.
That's why he sells so much.

305
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,790
I didn't understand even half
of what you said right now.

306
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,070
I said he was a popular
painter on the Internet.

307
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,550
Ah, a little while
ago, he was flamed.

308
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,140
A fire?

309
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,550
He was criticized on the Internet
and eventually ended up being insulted.

310
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,790
Other artists were
the first to criticize him.

311
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,780
Exposed - Kashiwada is cornered-Thread - Plagiarism

312
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,780
"I'll become the New World's god!" What is the person who was saying that? LOL

313
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,230
This feeling resembling revenge
ended up equivalent to getting hit.

314
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,950
The data drawn on a PC was stolen in a trace attack!

315
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,460
It's plagiarism and even from his parents.

316
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,590
Rumor has it that his parents sexually abused him, but the
behavior of running away on the pretext of that is disgusting.

317
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,590
It's plagiarism~

318
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,590
The video of Kashiwada committing suicide

319
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,520
That's more than disgusting.

320
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,350
After that Kashiwada publicly
committed suicide in a live broadcast.

321
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,670
Kashiwada committed suicide.

322
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,230
But the video that shouldn't
exist is wandering about the net.

323
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,750
Followed by suspicious deaths.

324
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,750
After all everything is
because of Kashiwada's curse...

325
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,140
There is no such thing as a curse.

326
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,070
You're really naive.
Kashiwada is alive.

327
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
Since there is no corpse.

328
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,850
I guess so.

329
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,110
Just... what was he going to do?

330
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,430
Don't know.

331
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,610
Are we going?

332
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,860
Stand.

333
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,780
Bow.

334
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,750
Goodbye.

335
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,560
Let's go home!

336
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,790
Let's go back!

337
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,360
Sensei, goodbye!

338
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,040
Goodbye.

339
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,390
Goodbye.

340
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,950
Goodbye!

341
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,600
Goodbye.

342
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,110
Ayukawa-sensei, how is it?
Have the students calmed down?

343
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,910
A little bit.

344
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,400
Okay.

345
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,550
Ah, is Kitayama-san absent?

346
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,750
Uh... she came,
but why do you ask?

347
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,270
Ah, because she isn't
attending club activities.

348
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,070
Well, such a thing happened and
not much time has passed yet, so

349
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,840
it can't be helped, can it?

350
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,150
That's right. Since she
received the biggest shock...

351
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,560
Isn't he awfully cool?

352
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,110
He isn't my type at all.

353
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,960
Right?

354
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,750
She's more the White Prince Charming-Type...

355
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,110
No way, no way!

356
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,910
Hey, hey! Did Kitayama-san go home again?

357
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,280
Who knows...

358
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,740
Ah, she isn't in the study hall?

359
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Right, thank you.

360
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,590
Hey, hey. Isn't Risa
a little strange lately?

361
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,900
Since Noriko died.

362
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,470
Right, right.

363
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,470
Wicked, isn't it?

364
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,470
And she is always saying

365
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,180
"I'm looking for it", the cursed video.

366
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,490
Let's get started.

367
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,230
I'll take revenge on this
world's guys who eliminated me.

368
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,350
If she is revived, it'll
be the end for everyone.

369
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,510
The resurrection of S.

370
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,710
S...

371
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,990
will eliminate all human beings.

372
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,550
No!

373
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,090
It's you.

374
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,830
Kitayama-san, are you alright?

375
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,870
No!

376
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,310
Don't come, stay over there...

377
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,190
Sensei did this, right?

378
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,540
Kitayama-san, hey.

379
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,320
Stay back!

380
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,820
Don't come!

381
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,300
Kitayama-san.

382
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
What's wrong?

383
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,990
When Kitayama
Risa-san was brought here

384
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,720
she was terribly scared.

385
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,310
But now, with the administration of the
tranquilizer, she considerably settled down.

386
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,780
I wonder what she was scared of.

387
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,910
Well, she said "I'll be killed".

388
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,230
Be killed?

389
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,560
Yes.

390
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,910
Moreover, also when the homeroom teacher came,
I had the feeling Kitayama-san became a little strange.

391
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,970
Over there.

392
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,310
Sensei, could you please
explain what happened?

393
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,010
I don't know.

394
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,670
But we were told that she said not to
put a TV or monitor in her hospital room.

395
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,350
Well, if a PC bursts on it's
own, anyone would be surprised.

396
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,630
And who was she talking
about, when she said

397
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,180
"I'll be killed", huh?

398
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,510
What exactly did she see, huh?

399
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,010
I don't know...

400
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,870
For example, the recently trendy

401
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,790
cursed video or something.

402
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,430
Detective-san, do you
believe the cursed video exists?

403
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,020
No.

404
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,030
Because I'm a police officer, I don't believe
in such things like supernatural power or curses.

405
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,890
I'm sorry, okay?

406
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,390
But the strange happenings
are continuing, aren't they?

407
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,030
Do you know this person?

408
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,670
This man is Kashiwada Seiji.
You haven't heard about him?

409
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,140
No.

410
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,550
Say, Detective-san,

411
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,750
isn't it enough for today?

412
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,910
Oh, I'm sorry,
although you're tired.

413
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,250
Ayukawa-sensei.

414
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,890
Ah, sensei.

415
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,270
Kitayama-san pretty
much calmed down, so

416
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,710
are you going to meet with her
one more time before you go back?

417
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,910
No... please excuse me.

418
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,680
Akane, eat.

419
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,350
Ah, sorry.

420
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,990
Akane, did something happen at school?

421
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,670
Oh... but it's alright if you
don't want to talk about it.

422
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,230
I think it might sound strange, but

423
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,830
on the school's PC, a student...

424
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,030
searched for the cursed video in question.

425
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,110
And... when I entered the classroom,

426
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,370
from inside the PC,

427
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,190
a woman with long hair
came out and kept attacking.

428
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,050
The cursed video...

429
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,170
Do you believe it?

430
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,170
Because, Akane...
you saw it, didn't you?

431
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,870
Takanori...

432
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,710
That subliminal or
something, it... it's not like that.

433
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,370
It's scarier.

434
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,590
It wasn't out of this world.

435
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,550
I think, that Morisaki-san died is
without doubt due to that video.

436
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,490
So please,

437
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,430
Takanori... do-don't use the PC
or something like that again.

438
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,290
Got it.

439
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,190
But in the end,
the cursed video was a lie.

440
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,360
What?

441
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,210
Because...

442
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,060
Akane is perfectly alive here.

443
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,150
Enoki-kun?

444
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,190
Akane-san? Can you talk right now?

445
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,780
Yeah.

446
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,630
Somehow, seems like
you have various problems, huh?

447
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,310
Did you hear from Takanori?

448
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,630
Okay okay, please.

449
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,950
Akane-san, rather than that, I received
new information on the cursed video.

450
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,700
Eh?

451
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,990
You know, somehow, the person in
the video seems to search for somebody.

452
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,090
What do you mean?

453
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,910
After watching the video,
apparently one can hear

454
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,050
"It's not you."

455
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,930
It's not you...

456
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,140
No, seriously.

457
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,550
Please be absolutely cautious, Akane-san.

458
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,910
Run away! Hurry up and run! Quickly!

459
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,750
Hurry up and run! Get away from the PC! Everyone, run away!

460
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,830
Sensei! Sensei!

461
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,810
It's just a blackout!

462
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,370
Sensei, are you alright?

463
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,250
Ayukawa-sensei,

464
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,030
since Morisaki-san passed away,
you seem considerably tired, don't you?

465
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,240
No...

466
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,110
You'd better take a break for a while.

467
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,270
I'm sorry. But I'm really all right.

468
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,430
Then, what did you mean
by the commotion like today?

469
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,190
I think you're certainly not all right.

470
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
One more thing.

471
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,430
We're also very concerned
about Kitayama-san's case.

472
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,950
Kitayama-san is still
staying in the hospital, right?

473
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,300
Yes.

474
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,100
She's afraid of you, isn't she?

475
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,670
Ah, uhm... that's...

476
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,510
Anyway, please take a break.

477
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,430
Also, for today's class another
teacher will take your place.

478
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,120
Understood.

479
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,600
I...

480
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,950
I have to rest and must not
go to school for a while.

481
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,230
I see. And I also didn't take in work.

482
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,780
Ah, should we go
somewhere and have fun?

483
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,270
I'm sorry. It's my fault, right?

484
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,290
That's not true.

485
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,270
It's true...
everything is my fault.

486
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,170
Hey Takanori,

487
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,270
you don't have to be with me anymore.

488
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,840
Huh?

489
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,270
Being with me, surely,
again bad things will happen.

490
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,680
That's not true.

491
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,030
Because it was so in the past and...

492
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,790
Again, this time as well...

493
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,630
Hmm,

494
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,610
how should I say it...

495
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,350
Somehow...
Akane has a honest heart.

496
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,910
That's why I like Akane.

497
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,550
Whatever people say,
I believe in Akane's power.

498
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,120
Takanori...

499
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,820
I'm afraid of myself.

500
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,150
Up until now, I've looked
away from various things.

501
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,830
By chance, it might have
been likely even for Takanori.

502
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
But, I...

503
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,940
I accept that I'm
a conceited person.

504
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,630
I must face it properly, don't I?

505
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,190
Well, no matter how much more
bad things may happen from now on,

506
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,960
I'll be together with Akane.

507
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,850
Thank you.

508
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,870
Come on, let's go eat.

509
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,750
Let's get started.

510
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,470
The resurrection of S.

511
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,830
S-... S will eliminate all human beings.

512
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,300
Ta-Takanori! Don't look, turn it off!

513
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,830
Turn it off! Hurry and turn it off!

514
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,390
Hey, turn it off! Hurry!

515
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,750
It just won't disappear!

516
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,100
Hurry up and turn it off! This!

517
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,360
Damn it, disappear!

518
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,440
Takanori!

519
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Akane!

520
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,330
It's you.

521
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,760
Akane...

522
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,750
Akane!

523
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,480
Akane, are you alright?!

524
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,530
Yeah.

525
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,960
Takanori!

526
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,070
Takanori, Takanori! Ah... Takanori!

527
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,270
Hey, hey! What the hell are
you doing! Hey, stop, stop it!

528
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,150
What are you, hey! Stop, get away!

529
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,040
Takanori!

530
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,910
What are you up to, hey! Let go!

531
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,310
Hey, stop! What are you doing! Stop!

532
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:21,400
P-Please stop!

533
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,060
Aren't you scared?

534
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,530
Let's go back together, okay?

535
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,930
Okay.

536
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,030
Takanori-kun, if you are with
me, you'll be disliked by everyone.

537
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,160
Is that so?

538
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,400
Because... I'm not normal, don't you think?

539
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,500
I think Ayukawa is amazing.

540
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,160
I didn't have a reason to say "stay back".

541
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,530
Ayukawa! For saving me... thank you.

542
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:50,060
I think, it's a previous
power to protect people.

543
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,700
Even if there's such a
thing, I'm totally okay.

544
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:58,560
Well, but if Ayukawa is
comforted, it cant be helped.

545
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,160
Let's go eat.

546
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,070
The truck you were talking about...
there were no particularly doubtful points.

547
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,120
What the heck is your problem?

548
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,830
I don't know at all
what you're telling me.

549
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,590
A woman came out of the
truck and kidnapped your boyfriend?

550
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,250
What are you talking about?

551
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,910
Koiso-san...

552
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,490
Yeah?

553
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,950
The cursed video is real.

554
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
That again...

555
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
Have you also seen it?

556
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
Yes.

557
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,870
Then why didn't you
die from the curse?

558
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,680
Everyone died, didn't they?

559
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,350
First, show me that video.

560
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,810
It's impossible.

561
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,710
That video is alive and is moving.

562
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,580
Seriously.

563
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,070
In the video... Kashiwada died.

564
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,830
There was no corpse in
Kashiwada's home. That guy is alive.

565
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,020
If he isn't, who in the
world is controlling the video?

566
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,030
Coming out from the video...

567
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
is a woman with long hair.

568
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
It's true.

569
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,110
Assuming there is
such a thing as a woman,

570
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,790
coming out of the video, at times
killing and at other times kidnapping,

571
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,750
how did Kashiwada create such a monster?

572
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,040
What is he trying to do?

573
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,910
In the video, Kashiwada was saying

574
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
"The resurrection of S".

575
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Resurrection of S?

576
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,690
He is probably...

577
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,750
trying to revive that
woman with the long hair.

578
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,590
You mean, for the sake
of that monster's food,

579
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,790
Kashiwada is using
the video to kill people?

580
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,720
No.

581
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,240
I think...

582
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,980
he's definitely looking for a vessel.

583
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,160
Vessel?

584
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,990
That woman still doesn't have a form.

585
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,190
I think, Kashiwada
made the video, because

586
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,590
he's searching for a
vessel that fits to the woman.

587
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,130
It's you.

588
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,670
That...

589
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
is me.

590
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,190
Don't understand...
I don't understand.

591
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,210
Koiso-san.

592
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,390
Hmm?

593
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,890
Nakamura, is that you?

594
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,750
...I... I saw it.

595
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,920
Huh?

596
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,950
It... it was real; the cursed video.

597
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,790
Ka... Kashiwada is...

598
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,610
Kashiwada?

599
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,570
Stop!

600
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,650
Nakamura!

601
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,670
Akane-san!

602
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,870
Enoki-kun!? You...

603
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,470
Akane-san, you're late!
What are you doing?

604
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,280
What?

605
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,630
Aren't you going to
look for Takanori-san?

606
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,550
Enoki-kun, why?

607
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,100
Akane-san, you're really slow.

608
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,230
So it's alright if
Takanori-san never comes back?

609
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,290
He will die.

610
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,310
Takanori!? Do you
know where he is?

611
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,470
Well... I wonder where...

612
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,210
Where is Takanori!?

613
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,830
That's why I said,

614
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,160
you have to hurry or he'll die.

615
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,480
What are you talking about?

616
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,680
You know, later

617
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,870
if you're moving so slow,
everyone else... everyone...

618
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
Everybody will die.

619
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,550
Eh?

620
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:42,070
The next one is in the hospital.
It seems it's a student called Risa-chan.

621
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,440
Kitayama-san?

622
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,920
What are you doing to her!?

623
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,560
Hey, stop it! Hey!

624
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
Over here, here!

625
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,730
This way!

626
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,670
Sadako's resurrection...

627
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,060
Sadako, Sadako...

628
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,190
Sadako's resurrection, Sadako's resurrection...

629
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,950
Due to dreadful feelings, energy's...

630
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,810
Sadako will eliminate all human beings.

631
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,350
Sadako's resurrection. Sadako's perfect resurrection...

632
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,300
Based on a large vessel, I should
create the ultimate dreadful existence.

633
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,860
Her thoughts still remain inside the well.

634
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,010
For the sake of Sadako, I offer this death.

635
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,510
Everything is for the sake of
Sadako, for Sadako's resurrection.

636
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,990
For the sake of Sadako's resurrection,
I'll hand this woman's body into the well.

637
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,710
The concept is the annihilation of life
forms with energy due to elimination...

638
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,510
The release of energy by feelings.

639
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,630
For the sake of Sadako's resurrection,
I'll hand this woman's body into the well.

640
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,200
Her thoughts still remain inside the well...

641
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,830
For the sake of Sadako's resurrection,
I'll hand this woman's body into the well.

642
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,700
Her thoughts are... desperate...

643
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,650
Death is everything...

644
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,670
Sadako's resurrection, her perfect resurrection.

645
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,710
The resurrection of S?

646
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,820
Kashiwada!

647
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,800
Enough already!

648
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,000
Kitayama-san!

649
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,630
Sen... sei...

650
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,650
Kitayama-san?

651
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,850
No!

652
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,650
Sensei!

653
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,400
I was so scared...

654
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,850
I'm sorry...

655
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:05,070
It's alright already. I'm sorry, okay?

656
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,910
For saving me... thank you.

657
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,000
I'll go, too.

658
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,520
Takanori is there.

659
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,390
I'll save Takanori.

660
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,560
It's as you said.

661
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,510
Kashiwada was trying to
perform Sadako's resurrection.

662
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,760
Sadako?

663
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,840
It's a girl who died decades ago.

664
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:28,790
Because she had something like psychic powers,
she was casted out by humans and eventually...

665
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,600
that power killed a large number of people.

666
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:38,710
Some people were afraid of that and
threw Sadako in a well while she was still alive.

667
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,510
Kashiwada was trying to resurrect Sadako.

668
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:59,300
In order to provide a body to
Sadako, he kept kidnapping and

669
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,630
pitched the women, who
were still alive, into the well.

670
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,790
It was when that live broadcast was aired,

671
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,470
that the nationwide search
for Sadako's vessel had begun.

672
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,400
And then...

673
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,260
Sadako has found me.

674
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,320
It's the well?

675
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,910
Takanori, where are you?

676
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,130
Let's get started.

677
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
Koiso-san!

678
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,470
No! No!

679
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,520
Koiso-san!

680
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,040
Go...

681
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,670
Hurry... go.

682
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,450
No...

683
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
Takanori!

684
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,360
Takanori!?

685
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,800
It's you.

686
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,080
Sa... Sadako.

687
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,470
Give Takanori back!

688
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,430
Takanori, stop! Stop it!

689
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,280
Make him stop!

690
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,990
The one you want is me, right!

691
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,520
Takanori!?

692
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,800
Takanori, what's wrong!?

693
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:47,830
You and I are the same.

694
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,720
No!

695
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,630
I neither bear a grudge
against nor curse people!

696
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,430
You are...

697
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,940
me.

698
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,470
You... you're wrong!

699
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,950
You use your power to kill people!

700
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,110
I use this power for the sake of people!

701
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,280
Takanori!

702
01:26:57,730 --> 01:27:01,630
Takanori!

703
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,840
Akane!

704
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,830
Takanori!

705
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,080
Akane!?

706
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,550
Akane! Akane, Akane!

707
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Akane!

708
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,520
Akane!?

709
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,310
Akane, Akane!

710
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,800
Akane!

711
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,400
Akane?

712
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,920
Takanori...

713
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,430
Akane, are you alright?

714
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,840
Yeah...

715
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,280
Thank god.

716
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:01,120
Akane...

717
