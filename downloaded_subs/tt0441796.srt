1
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,700
- How was it?
- I played this game. "Stay Alive."

2
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Seriously, man,
the sickest shit since Fatal Frame.

3
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,600
It was creepy. Really creepy.

4
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,900
Are you gonna make it over here? Can you
come over? You wanna come over?

5
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Dude, look, I'll come up this weekend,
we'll burn it solid.

6
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,100
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Late.

7
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,700
- Shit, man. Don't you knock?
- All right. Whoops.

8
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,100
- Shut the door, perv.
- I found you in the game. You got it good.

9
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,000
We haven't played for hours.

10
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
OK.

11
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
This is not real. Don't freak.

12
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,200
- Hello?

13
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,100
- Hello?

14
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,700
Rex?

15
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,100
Sar...

16
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
Sarah?

17
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,900
Rex! No!

18
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,700
Please!

19
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Oh!

20
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,300
- That was fast.
- Hi. How are you?

21
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,100
- Did you take care of the marina report?
- I was just about to.

22
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Oh, don't bother.

23
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,400
He wants to see you right away,
and he's in one of his moods.

24
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,900
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Oh, merci. darling.

25
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,200
Hi.

26
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,700
- I was just gonna...
- Over a month.

27
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,700
That's how long
I've been working on this.

28
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,900
Right? That's, uh...

29
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,200
That's 100... that's 100 hours.

30
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry. I'll finish
the marina report as soon as possible.

31
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The ma... The what?

32
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
- Marina report?
- Yeah.

33
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Oh, man.

34
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Hm.

35
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,600
- Hutch.
- What?

36
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,000
You know what?
Have a seat. Enjoy yourself. OK?

37
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,000
All right, listen to me now, OK? I hired you
for one reason, and one reason only.

38
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Now, the walk-through says
I dump the ammo and the boss dies.

39
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm sorry. We're not still talking
about Silent Hill 4, are we?

40
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Yes.

41
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,700
OK. Damn. All right. Uh... I don't know what
else to tell you. You got the hyperblaster?

42
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:05,700
Do I look like an asshole?
Yes, I have the hyperblaster.

43
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,100
Right, OK. Yeah, dump it.

44
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,300
I mean, it's got unlimited ammo,
nullifies the... Hey, can I get tomorrow off?

45
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Let me think about that.

46
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,500
No, no, no.
I need it to get to the final boss.

47
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,200
Beat her up.
It's the way God intended.

48
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,300
You know, Hutch, if you put as much effort
into clerking as you did into gaming,

49
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,700
you could end up like me someday.
You know that, right?

50
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
OK.

51
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
All right, you can take tomorrow.
How do I do it?

52
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,100
It's easier to kill her
without the blaster.

53
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,700
So lose it right before going down the
stairs. She'll die on her own. Game over.

54
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,400
All right. OK. Hey, man,
are you hip to this PDA sex thing?

55
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,200
- I haven't got into that.
- You've got a phone call, Hutch.

56
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Thank you.

57
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,600
I think that's a vegetable.

58
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Hello?

59
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,300
What?

60
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,700
Oh, Hutch. I'm so glad that you came.
It means so much to me.

61
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,300
Today we lay to rest
Loomis Crowley...

62
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,700
- Did you just take a picture of me?
- I did.

63
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,600
There are so many crying faces
at this funeral and you seem the saddest,

64
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,500
but you weren't crying,

65
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,100
so I took a picture.

66
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,400
- You and Loomis must have been close.
- Yeah, we were close.

67
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,900
I mean, we were so close, but...
Did you know Loomis?

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Kinda.

69
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,600
I grew up with Sarah back in Georgia. I was
supposed to hang out with her that night.

70
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,300
Really? Yeah, so was I.

71
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,900
I always thought I'd be taking pictures
on her wedding day, not her funeral.

72
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,300
- Looks like you're up.
- Emma. Hi.

73
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,900
- Hi.
- How are you? God, look at you.

74
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,500
You're so grown-up.
How are you doing?

75
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm OK. Um, here.

76
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,500
This is your brother's bag.
You don't want this?

77
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,200
Mom and Dad won't let me play those
video games. They were gonna toss 'em.

78
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,100
You know, they're too violent.
Besides, he would want you to have 'em.

79
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
Come here. Take care, all right?

80
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
OK.

81
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Here. If you need to talk,
that's my number.

82
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
- Hey, sunshine.
- Hey.

83
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,100
Didn't think you'd be back so soon.

84
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Give us a kiss.

85
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,400
- Sorry, Hutch. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to believe.

86
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,700
Tragedy, Hutch.
I tell you, bro, first your parents, now this.

87
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,800
God dealt the straws
and gave you a short one, man.

88
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
You know, Phin,
the problem with your mouth

89
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,700
is that stupid insensitive shit
comes out of it. You're an idiot.

90
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,800
Be strong - that's all I'm saying. You know
what I mean, bro? You're a rock. I love you.

91
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,500
- I love you too.
- Who talks to their brother like that?

92
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,000
- Somebody with an idiot for a brother.
- Oh, my God, you're a terrible person.

93
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, do they know what happened yet?

94
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,800
He was murdered -
him and two of his friends.

95
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
- That's awful.
- What's in the bag?

96
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,000
- Games, pictures, crap like that.
- From Loomis?

97
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah.

98
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,300
- No shit! Is this you two?
- Yeah.

99
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,000
Look at that.

100
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,000
Lighter works.

101
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,100
- Gorgeous.
- Dude, you can keep that if you like it.

102
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,000
- I'm sorry, Hutch.
- You must have been adopted.

103
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,100
Thank you, Loomis.

104
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,300
- So he was a real gamer, huh?
- Yeah.

105
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,100
- Any good titles in the bag?
- I'm not sure. Check it out.

106
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,300
Goddamn, y'all.

107
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,800
Stay Alive? Never heard of it.

108
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,100
Yeah, that was the game
he was playing out the night he died.

109
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,900
He asked me to come over and play.
I totally blew him off.

110
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,000
- Hutch, come on. You didn't know.
- I know. It's just...

111
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
- How'd he get his hands on it?
- He did some beta-testing.

112
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,400
I beta-tested for a while. It's awesome
at first, then it's goddamn monotonous.

113
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,800
- Let's burn a round for Loomis.
- Are you an idiot?

114
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,100
I told you, that'd be weird.
That was the last thing he was doing.

115
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,300
Hey, sack up, bro.

116
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:25,500
If Loomis was indeed testing this game,
that means it is barely legal.

117
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,800
Yeah, this could be nice.

118
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,100
- Hey.
- Jesus Christ!

119
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,500
Can Hutch come out and play?

120
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,800
Swink,
you scared the crap out of me, man.

121
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,700
Why, yes, I'd love to come in.
Thank you for asking.

122
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I wanna make sure we're all set up.

123
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,700
So, uh...

124
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry, you know,
about your friend and all.

125
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,200
It...

126
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,900
stinks.

127
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,600
Thanks, man.
Look, it's all good. No worries.

128
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,400
It'll be good to hang out with you guys,
get my mind off things.

129
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,500
Hey. Ooh.

130
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,400
Dollface, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

131
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,900
Hey, you made it.
October, fellas, this is Abigail.

132
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,600
She's kind of a friend of Loomis's.
She's gonna hang out for a while.

133
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,000
- What's up, mama?
- What's up? I gotta pee.

134
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,700
- Oh, yeah. It's right down the hallway.
- Oh, sorry.

135
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,400
- All right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

136
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,100
Girl has got body karate going on.

137
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,800
Anyone who says size doesn't matter
never played a third-person shooter.

138
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,500
You're a whore.

139
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,600
- Here.
- No.

140
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,700
- What did you say?
- Hey.

141
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,800
God, that thing is gay.
And it smells.

142
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,400
- Don't worry, I'll get your back.
- Sweet Sebastian Bach, I wanna play.

143
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,000
- Bossman hooking up?
- Miller, you signed in? You there?

144
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,400
Yeah, I'm here.

145
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, Loretta called my wife, told her
I got caught up in a partner meeting.

146
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,200
All right, guys. Enough chatter.
The name of this game is Stay Alive.

147
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,900
We don't know much else,
other than we're not supposed to have it.

148
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Sit back down.

149
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,700
Bro!

150
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,100
Let's do it.

151
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,700
- Dude.
- Put your hands on it.

152
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
- Disgusting.
- Touch it.

153
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,300
She's stubborn.
Isn't letting me get to the game.

154
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,300
Maybe you're supposed to read
that prayer right there.

155
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,300
- Just a thought.
- Voice-activated? No way.

156
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,200
- That's next-generation technology.
- OK.

157
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,500
"Come to me, clouds."

158
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Whoa.

159
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,900
- What?
- It's... it's like a séance or...

160
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,300
Can we skip this bullshit cinematic
foreplay? I wanna butter this muffin.

161
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,200
- OK. Let's go. Everybody say this, right?
- OK.

162
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,900
"Come to me, clouds.

163
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,200
"May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.

164
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,000
"Let the cover of night bear witness
and destroy those who resist

165
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,600
"so they shall harm me not.

166
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,100
"Let the blood of many cleanse me,

167
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,400
"preserving beauty eternal, I pray you."

168
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,700
Welcome.
If you're listening to this.

169
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,300
it means you've made a grave mistake.

170
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,000
You spoke the words.
and soon you will die for it.

171
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,100
At this very moment. the evil of this place
courses through your veins.

172
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,400
You have been marked for death.

173
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,800
Your choice has brought you here.

174
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,700
to Gerouge Plantation.

175
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,400
200 years ago.
Countess Elizabeth Bathory

176
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,900
opened Gerouge
as a finishing school for young...

177
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
- Gerouge.
- You've heard of it?

178
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Yeah. Grandma used to tell us if we didn't
get home before dark, we'd get taken off...

179
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Yeah, but do you remember Grandma
used to wear panties on the outside?

180
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,300
Seriously, though, I know this, guys.
I've heard this story.

181
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,700
What happened to those girls
was so depraved

182
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,900
that all accounts were stricken
from public record.

183
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,000
The evil of Gerouge has been reborn.

184
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Your salvation lies
beyond the gates of this plantation.

185
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,200
Your only chance is this:

186
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,800
uncover the horrible truth about
Gerouge Plantation and stop the evil.

187
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:16,800
But. in order to do that.

188
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,600
you must stay alive.

189
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,400
- My God.
- I'm starting to get a little creeped out.

190
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
- Sh!
- Shut the hell up.

191
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,500
- Where the hell are you going?
- Just trying to figure it out.

192
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,100
- What is that?
- Whoa.

193
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,900
- You guys feel that?
- Hell, yeah. Feel it in my pants, baby.

194
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,600
- Must mean we're close to something.
- Or something's close to us.

195
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Uh, you better pull your weapon, bro.

196
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,600
- Somebody do something. Swink?
- No, I'm good.

197
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,100
How do you kill her?
She's already dead. Look out!

198
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,100
When fear cripples you.
when death's shadow surrounds you.

199
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:15,800
drop a rose.

200
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,000
It will help you stay alive.

201
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Right. It'll give us a chance
to escape ghosts we can't face.

202
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,400
Undead can't cross
the twig of a wild rose.

203
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,800
That is what you learn when you read
too much goth chick-lit. Lay off the incense.

204
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,800
And the game's fun,
but it kind of moves along at a snail's pace.

205
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
Left, go left.
Left! On your left!

206
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,800
Left! Left!
Goddamn it, you noob!

207
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,100
OK. and you eat my nails.
and you eat my nails.

208
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,800
Go round the mausoleum. man.
Nice. And eat this.

209
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,800
Come on! Sweet Jesus, these dead bitches
are coming out in droves.

210
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,200
Miller. the Bathory tomb.
in front of you.

211
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,400
Do not close the door. man.
Do not close the door. No! Oh. my God!

212
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Hello, Mumsy.

213
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,300
- Whoa, whoa. What's that?
- What's... where?

214
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,600
- There. Is something in that wardrobe?
- Oh, nice eye.

215
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Thank you.

216
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,100
- Congrats, Abs.
- It's a secret room or something.

217
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,300
- Is that a diary?
- Yeah.

218
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,000
The one from the beginning
with the prayer in it.

219
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,800
- Miller. are you OK?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

220
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,100
Are you in those tunnels again? There is
no action there. The doors are locked.

221
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,500
Well, they're open now.
You know, I'm exploring, tearing shit up.

222
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:46,600
- Ownin' fools.
- "Ownin' fools"?

223
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,800
- I'm telling you, my controller is vibrating.
- You'd better drop a rose.

224
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,500
Now I'm out of... I'm out of...
I'm out of goddamn roses, man.

225
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,200
- Tell us what you see before you book it.
- Some sort of sick torture room or...

226
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,200
God, man.
I just saw a flash of dead girls, or...

227
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,700
Goddammit, man.

228
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
- She got me.
- One of the girls?

229
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,400
Some woman, man. I think it was the dame
from the painting. You know, that countess.

230
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I didn't even
get a chance to fight her, man.

231
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,900
- Where's the torture chamber?
- I went through a secret entrance.

232
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey, are you gonna try
and get back in the game?

233
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Well...

234
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Hey, is somebody out there?

235
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,900
- Miller. who are you talking to?
- I don't know.

236
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Probably some goddamn rent-a-cop
trying to scare the shit out of the living.

237
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,900
You know what they say. You play
the game too long, you start seeing shit.

238
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,400
- You know, or have seizures.
- Games could cause seizures.

239
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,800
Perceptive reality, on the other hand,
has yielded some interesting studies.

240
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,300
- And you've read them all.
- I have. It seems the longer you play,

241
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,000
the more your mind
perceives the game world to be a reality.

242
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,600
It's interesting, but it's only a theory.
But then there's retinal memory, which...

243
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,800
That is so fascinating, sweetie,
but I'm feeling like we should call it a night.

244
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,700
Yeah, some of us
have gotta be at work.

245
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,700
All right.
Miller. you can rejoin us. then.

246
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,200
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll check my schedule.

247
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Thanks again for hanging, you guys.
I really needed it.

248
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,400
- To Loomis.
- To Loomis.

249
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
To Loomis.

250
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
All right. OK. OK.

251
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Perceptive reality.

252
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,800
- Hutch!
- Loretta.

253
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,000
- What's going on? What's going on?

254
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,600
- What's going on?
- It's Miller.

255
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Miller?

256
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,800
Miller. Miller!

257
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,200
Hey, it's a crime scene.
You have to clear out.

258
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,800
Can I get a damn curtain over here?

259
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,200
- I just spoke to him a few hours ago.
- Whoa. A few hours ago?

260
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,300
- Get off me.
- All right, buddy. Come on. Come on.

261
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,900
Thanks.

262
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,500
I know this kind of thing ain't easy, son.
I'm gonna try to be quick about it.

263
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,600
You were here
with Mr. Banks last night?

264
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,500
Uh, no. I was at my house.
We were playing a video game.

265
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,800
Oh.

266
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,100
His wife said that he was working late.

267
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah, sorry. What I meant was, he was
playing from here and I was at my place.

268
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,900
- Just the two of you?
- I was with four friends. We were online.

269
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Uh-huh.

270
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,500
- Make sure we get those names.
- Roger that.

271
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,300
- Do you live close by?
- Yeah, uptown. Off Magazine.

272
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Oh, yeah?
That's only ten minutes away.

273
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Those figures could place you
at the scene of the crime.

274
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Charlie, chill.

275
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
- I just wanna know what happened to him.
- All right, now.

276
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
OK, if you ever need to give me a call,

277
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,800
my name is Detective Thibodeaux.

278
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,600
I may need to speak with you again.

279
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
And I'm sorry about your friend.

280
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,300
Thanks.

281
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
All right.

282
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
Sweet shit! Get a load of this!

283
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,700
I think I've found bossman's body.

284
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,400
- Oh, God!
- That's off-putting.

285
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,700
- Didn't you just say Miller was stabbed?
- Man, I can't look at this.

286
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,700
I'll have to quit
hanging around with you.

287
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm sorry. Phin, if you had any less sense,
you'd be half a penny.

288
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,400
Now shut the goddamn game up.

289
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,100
- Because we found Miller's body in it?
- It is a horror survival game.

290
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,700
I hate to be a dick, but I think
you guys are overreacting a little bit.

291
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,800
- Would you show some respect, man?
- Respect?

292
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,400
You pay respect to gamers by gaming,
so let's boot it up. To Miller.

293
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,000
- You're not playing for Miller or Loomis.
- You didn't even know those guys, right?

294
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,100
If you wanna curl up in the fetal position
for the day, fine, but don't expect me to.

295
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,700
As for you,
I just met you yesterday, so kiss my ass.

296
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:51,800
- Phin!
- What?

297
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,900
Look, why don't you guys get out of here
and let me play in peace?

298
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,500
Peace.

299
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,100
Hey, take it easy.

300
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm sorry.

301
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,700
Are you OK?

302
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,200
- I'm just having a hard time, you know?
- Yeah.

303
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,100
Abigail, what's your story?
We don't know much about you,

304
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,600
other than you can't game for shit.

305
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,700
Well, I grew up in Georgia.

306
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,200
My dad's an architect and my mom's
a kindergarten schoolteacher.

307
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,200
I'm going to Princeton in the fall.

308
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,800
Sounds like you've got
a perfect little family.

309
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't know about perfect.

310
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,600
- Uh...
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

311
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,600
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

312
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,400
I've got a thing with fire.
It's a long story. No big deal.

313
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,100
What's up?

314
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Finding Miller's body in the game...

315
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,400
Look, I'm no gamer, but there are only so
many ways you could die in a video game.

316
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,200
It's all just really bad timing.

317
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,400
Not really. In a sense, the timing is bad
because he overresponds to deaths.

318
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,900
But the coincidence of finding Miller's
game body and his real body was perfect.

319
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:28,900
That's why we're freaked out.

320
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,700
It's better in single player anyway.

321
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,500
Dickheads.

322
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,000
All right, Countess, let's go.

323
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,900
There you are.
Oh, you hate mirrors. I forgot.

324
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,500
- You can't break this one.

325
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,200
Maybe timing had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was inevitable.

326
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,800
Possible homicidal replication
on a sociopathic level.

327
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Where are you going?

328
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,600
Loomis and his friends were playing that
video game the night they died. Now Miller.

329
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,900
What are the chances of all of them being
murdered right after playing that game?

330
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Jesus, if Phineus is playing...

331
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,700
- Come on, honey. You've gotta relax.
- It's just bad timing.

332
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,700
Swink said
maybe timing has nothing to do with it.

333
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,900
Did I say that? I have a penchant
for big theories. Don't listen to me.

334
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,900
Phineus!
Phin! Oh, my God!

335
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,800
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm pulling this bitch. What's it look like?

336
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,300
- What if Loomis and Miller...
- Was more than a coincidence?

337
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,400
They both played the game
and then they died, so...

338
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,900
obviously the video game
killed them, right?

339
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,300
- Are you serious, man? Listen to yourself.
- Phin.

340
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,500
I was ready to bite it anyway.
Check this mirror I found.

341
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,400
I flipped it. The back works like a mirror,
but it won't break like the others.

342
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,800
I think it's made out of polished silver.
I don't know. You guys don't have one.

343
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:13,600
You've been through a lot and I love you,
but you're freaking everybody out now.

344
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,400
I know. Yeah.

345
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,200
Nice.

346
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,200
"No distinguishing marks."

347
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,200
Had a broken banister.

348
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
"Adjoined twin blades."

349
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,400
This is why I'm missing
my G4techTV weekend wrap-up?

350
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
Hot sugar.
We had this conversation.

351
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,300
Call me crazy, call me paranoid,
I don't give a shit. Just look at this.

352
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,500
- Why isn't Phineus showing?
- He said he'd be here, so he'll be here.

353
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,700
OK. So we all saw
that Miller was stabbed to death.

354
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,000
The cops think he was stabbed
with shears. Loomis's friends too.

355
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,300
Sarah - her body was drained of blood.

356
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,300
The police report said Loomis's neck
was broken, and he was hung in the game.

357
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,400
They all died
the same way they died in the game.

358
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
This can't just be some coincidence.

359
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,100
I don't like this at all.

360
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,300
I think you're right.

361
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,500
You know I told you I heard
the story of Gerouge from my grandma?

362
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,300
This Elizabeth Bathory chick
was sick and twisted - and very real.

363
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,200
Guys, every detail of this game
is based on her real life.

364
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,400
The tower,
the cemetery, the torture chamber.

365
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,600
She'd hunt for victims in a black carriage.

366
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,600
She'd gut them with silver shears. The
shattered mirrors, why were they broken?

367
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,300
She couldn't stand to see herself get old.
All facts.

368
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,000
All I care about is finding out
what happened to Miller and Loomis,

369
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,100
and you are not helping.

370
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,200
As punishment, they walled the bitch up
in her tower alive - and here's the kicker.

371
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,600
The last thing she said
was that one day she'd be back.

372
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,000
So what if she's back and killing us
one by one after we die in the game?

373
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,900
This is insane. Listen to yourself.

374
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,700
You don't want to listen to me, fine. All
I care about is: Where the hell is Phineus?

375
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:52,400
# Close your eyes,
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams

376
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,900
# Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams

377
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Funky.

378
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,600
Is anybody out there?

379
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,800
Phin, are you OK?

380
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,600
- Yeah. I'm awesome.
- Phin, it's Hutch. Where are you?

381
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,600
I was on my way,
but my whip got stuck out on River Road.

382
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,200
- I'm just south of Binky's Adult Store.
- I'll drive.

383
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,000
- Who's that? Abigail?
- Yeah.

384
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,700
- What's up, mama?
- What's up?

385
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,500
Swink, when you were talking
about perceptive reality,

386
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,000
were you talking about
hearing or seeing things, or both?

387
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,500
Both. It's bizarre.
Retinally speaking...

388
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,500
Shut up. I've not tripped out like this
since I ate that matzo ball at Bible camp.

389
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,100
Hey. Phin. hang on.
We're coming to get you.

390
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,500
Let's go.

391
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,500
You didn't die in the game.
I'll be right there.

392
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,500
That's right!
I didn't die in the game, baby.

393
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Hey.

394
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,700
Wait a minute.
In the game, she only comes at night.

395
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,600
Is anybody out there?

396
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,000
OK, we're close.
Look for his car.

397
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,100
Stop, stop, stop. Stop! Wait.

398
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Phin!

399
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Phin.

400
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,200
Jesus. Phineus died
exactly the same way he died in the game.

401
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,200
Need to tell me something?

402
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,300
This is...

403
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,900
This is gonna sound crazy,

404
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,300
but this game, Stay Alive,

405
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,500
is about the Gerouge Plantation

406
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,800
and a woman, Elizabeth Bathory.

407
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,600
- I think I know that ghost story, yeah.
- OK. Phineus was run over in the game.

408
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:34,900
Miller died the same way
he died in the game too.

409
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,400
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, kid.
- I got this game last week from a friend.

410
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Him and two of his friends were murdered
the same way they died in the game.

411
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
Now, explain that.

412
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,500
Right.

413
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,700
That's the Crowley case,
over in Church Point.

414
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,200
You lived with that family, right?
After what happened with your folks?

415
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,300
Yeah.

416
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,800
You talked to that Crowley kid
the night he was murdered?

417
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,500
You know I did, Detective.

418
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,700
- Technically, anybody can hack into...
- Shut up.

419
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Let's take a walk.

420
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
- Let's see why you're so scared.
- I don't think...

421
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,600
Shut up.

422
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,800
- How do you do this thing?
- You have to read that.

423
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:22,800
All right.

424
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,400
"Come to me, clouds.
May you rise as..."

425
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,700
There must be a connection.

426
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,000
- Oh, yeah, there is, Hutch.
- Look, I already told you...

427
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,200
I'm telling you.
Friend or no friend, game or no game,

428
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,200
next time I see you on a crime scene,
I'm gonna take you in.

429
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,300
I wonder how you would feel
if that was your friend.

430
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,600
- Someone you cared about, Detective.
- I would let the cops do their job.

431
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Hey!

432
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,300
Hey, don't play that game.

433
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,900
Hey! Come on! Come on.

434
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,300
I just think
it would be better if no one plays.

435
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,700
I can see, at your tender age,
something like this might scare you.

436
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,500
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.

437
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
All right.

438
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,300
I'm gonna look into this,
but you're gonna have to go home, Hutch.

439
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Why don't you lock that kid up?

440
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,100
He rode up on a carriage
and mowed down the girl's brother?

441
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,300
This game business
sounds like bullshit.

442
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,400
That's great.
That's just really stupendous.

443
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,700
I know it! We all know it!
Something's happening, something bad!

444
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,100
Swink, shut the hell up!

445
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,400
You're not helping, man.

446
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,500
Why did you have to bring that game
into our lives, Hutch?

447
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,000
Why?

448
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,200
October.

449
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,800
My brother was all that I had.

450
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,200
That kid meant everything to me,
and now he's gone.

451
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
October...

452
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,300
I didn't know.

453
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,400
I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

454
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

455
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,800
Neither do I.

456
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,800
So we have to do something.

457
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,000
Hutch, I want you to find out
everything you can about this game.

458
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,000
OK. I can start with Loomis's house.

459
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,800
I need to stay with Swink
and take care of things for Phin.

460
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,200
Are you OK?
Are you sure you're up to this?

461
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,700
Hutch, somebody ran my brother down
in a horse-drawn carriage.

462
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,500
I'm gonna find whoever did it
and hurt them.

463
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:08,500
OK.

464
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,100
Abigail, stay with Hutch.
But if anything happens to him...

465
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,200
And we don't play that game,
not for a second.

466
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,200
Hey, a little help here?

467
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,300
Let me guess.
Your wife and kids are driving you nuts.

468
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,600
Need something to take the edge off?
Something with a high frag-count.

469
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,100
- Do I look 12, man?
- I take it you don't play, then.

470
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,400
I retired after I won
the Greater Louisiana Q*bert tournament.

471
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,100
- Oh, Q*bert, huh? Great.
- Yeah, listen.

472
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,900
I need information
on a horror game called Stay Alive.

473
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,600
Stay Alive? Never heard of it.

474
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,000
Maybe it's underground.

475
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,300
- Do you know who made it?
- Some basehead in his mom's attic.

476
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,100
You know, a game is just an extension
of the mind that created it.

477
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,700
You wouldn't play a game
by Charlie Manson.

478
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,300
No. Probably not.

479
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,200
Maybe you already have.

480
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Yeah. Yeah, I got nothing.

481
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,000
It's probably some sort of
underground game or something.

482
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,800
Yeah, right.
Hey, so, listen,

483
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,600
I'll talk to you in a little bit,
all right?

484
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
She must have left
at least one of these windows open.

485
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,900
- How do you know that?
- I lived with the Crowleys for a while.

486
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,600
Oh, yeah.

487
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,900
Yeah, it was like, you know,
Loomis's house just felt like home.

488
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah, I used to kinda run here
when things got, you know...

489
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,900
- You don't have to talk about it.
- No.

490
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,400
My dad went a little nuts,

491
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,300
thought my mom was sleeping around,
which she wasn't.

492
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,500
He figured
if she wasn't gonna be with him,

493
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:08,600
she wouldn't be with anybody,

494
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,500
so he set the place on fire.

495
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,400
Just torched it.

496
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,500
The firemen barely got me out alive,
but my mom...

497
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
She was still in bed
when they found her.

498
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,700
I tell myself if I'd been a little older
or a little braver,

499
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:32,200
I would've...

500
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,100
I would've stopped him.

501
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,800
I didn't move.

502
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,500
When he gets out, he'll be 76.

503
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,200
Ain't nothing like family.

504
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,100
This window's open.

505
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,300
So that's why you're scared of fire?

506
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,200
That's why I hate fire.

507
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,400
- I'll go around to the front door, OK?
- OK.

508
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,000
Come on.
Come on, come on.

509
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,500
Let's check out Loomis's room.

510
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,500
What could we find in here
that the cops haven't already found?

511
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,000
They didn't know where to look.

512
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,200
- Huh.
- What?

513
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,200
What is it?

514
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,500
It's the game company
Loomis tested for, where he got the game.

515
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,600
Scary.

516
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,600
I found the address for the game company.
Tell me where 1420 Cypress Road is.

517
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:06,700
Not a problem.

518
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,200
Let's see. Take the Belle Chasse Highway
to Breaux Bridge, near Spanish Lake.

519
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:13,400
Look, we're heading
to the game developer.

520
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,800
I've been reading this book
called The Malleus Demonium.

521
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,900
- What?
- It means "the witches' hammer."

522
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,300
It was a handbook for witch hunters
in the Inquisition. It says if we find her,

523
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,400
we need to put three nails through
her heart, neck, and then forehead.

524
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,900
The nails are gonna put
her human spirit back into her body,

525
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and then - this is really,
really important, you guys -

526
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,300
"An undead soul is only cleansed
by burning its blood."

527
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,100
So you think her ghost
could've been brought back?

528
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,400
It's like a séance. A strong enough spirit
can be brought back with the proper text.

529
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:49,400
I just can't believe this.

530
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,700
Detective Charles King
was murdered today at Clearwater Mall.

531
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:52,700
October?

532
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,600
Sources say
this murder may be linked...

533
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,100
Oh, my God!
The cop, King, he's dead.

534
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,200
What?

535
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,200
- We've got another problem.

536
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,400
Oh, God. The police are here.

537
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,700
OK, OK. Meet us at Loomis's.

538
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,200
- Loomis's?
- He's right.

539
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,200
- If you don't wanna go to jail, go now.
- Jail?

540
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,200
Now! Come on!

541
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,700
Give it to me.

542
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,200
Toss the apartment.

543
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,600
What have we got?

544
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,300
- You remember her diary?
- Her diary?

545
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,100
Yeah, in the game.

546
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,800
- What if that's it?
- What?

547
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,200
- The proper text.
- That would mean that...

548
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:04,200
This is not about some ghost.

549
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,800
You expect me to believe we conjured up
her evil spirit with a game séance?

550
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,300
- To start, we all had to recite that prayer.
- That just... It's highly unlikely.

551
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:18,500
What is it, Swink?

552
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,000
October and I were talking about this.
I don't know. Maybe she's onto something.

553
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,100
- Why is the game on?
- What?

554
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,100
The game.

555
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,000
I didn't turn it on.

556
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,000
I told you not to play.

557
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,800
- Where's October?
- She's out smoking.

558
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,100
But you said if we didn't play the game
we'd be fine. I thought those were the rules.

559
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,200
I don't know what the rules are.
Maybe there aren't any.

560
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:10,200
October!

561
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,200
It's not possible.
I didn't play. None of us did.

562
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,900
- If nobody played the game, that means...
- The game's playing by itself.

563
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,200
OK.

564
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,600
October!

565
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,100
October!

566
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,000
Shit!

567
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,300
No!

568
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,800
Let me go!

569
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,100
- October!
- October!

570
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,800
October!

571
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,500
Help me!

572
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
October!

573
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,700
Let me go!

574
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,700
- Open the window! Come on!

575
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,700
Come on!

576
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,100
Go fuck yourself.

577
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,100
Come on.

578
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,300
It's open. It's open.
October!

579
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,500
Oh, no! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

580
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,500
You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.

581
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,400
I can fix this. I can fix this. No, no, no, no.

582
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,400
Goddammit!
Please, don't do this to me!

583
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:33,300
- I shouldn't have left her alone.
- This isn't your fault, Swink.

584
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,000
This is all my fault.

585
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,300
You should've left
when you had the chance.

586
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,700
Your life was perfect before this.

587
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,200
My dad's not an architect.

588
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,300
- What?
- My dad's not an architect.

589
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,900
My mom doesn't teach first grade.

590
00:54:54,900 --> 00:55:00,200
- You mean kindergarten?
- Whatever. I'm not heading to Princeton.

591
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,800
Pretty much
everything I said was bullshit.

592
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,100
- So this van is...
- Home sweet home.

593
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:22,100
I hate telling people the truth and
watching them get embarrassed for asking.

594
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,700
We gotta end this.

595
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,400
We gotta stop it.

596
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,100
- I don't think we have much time.
- You're right. We don't have a lot of time.

597
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:31,900
We need to find her body.

598
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,900
Which means
we need to find her tower.

599
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,300
Whoever made this game
knows everything about Elizabeth Bathory.

600
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,500
They're the ones who are gonna know
exactly where her plantation really is.

601
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:50,500
Hey! Swink, what are you doing?

602
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,800
It's obvious we have to stay alive
in the game until we end this.

603
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,000
- One of us has to play.
- If you die in the game...

604
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,100
Something won't let us stop playing.
Am I right?

605
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,600
If it's gonna play with or without us,
at least I can use myself as a decoy.

606
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,100
I can protect us.

607
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,400
Let's go.

608
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,700
- All right, buddy, you know what to do.
- Stay alive.

609
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,500
Game time.

610
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,700
This thing is gay.

611
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,800
This is where
they made Stay Alive?

612
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,700
It seems like
a strange place to make a game.

613
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Come on. Let's go.

614
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,300
Hello?

615
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,600
Hold on.
I'm gonna check it out, OK?

616
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Wait here.

617
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh, my God.

618
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,100
Holy shit.

619
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,900
Thank God, man.
Tell me you haven't died in the game.

620
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,500
- No, we're fine.
- The place is deserted.

621
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,800
- OK, I need you to get to the back door.
- I'm not really sure where that is.

622
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,600
- What room are you in?
- Some kind of parlor.

623
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,300
All right. Hold on.

624
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,400
- You're looking at two entries?
- Yeah.

625
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,800
Move through the archway.
not the doorway. back into the hall.

626
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:44,800
There should be a staircase
to the right and the kitchen to the left.

627
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,900
What's going on, Swink?
How do you know all this?

628
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,700
Just pay attention. All right, go through
the kitchen and out the back door.

629
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,700
Just keep walking
until you see the steps with the statues.

630
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,400
- Do you see the iron gates?
- Uh. yeah. I see them.

631
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,000
Just like the game.

632
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,600
Oh, Jesus Christ.

633
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,600
This is Gerouge Plantation.

634
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,700
We're in the bitch's backyard.

635
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,100
Elizabeth.

636
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,100
- What does this mean, Hutch?
- It means her body's up in that tower.

637
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,000
No shit.

638
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,200
Elizabeth's diary.

639
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,700
All these girls. She killed them all.

640
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,400
Abigail's in trouble upstairs.
Which way do I go?

641
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:47,800
Uh...

642
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,400
It's faster to take
the staircase around the side.

643
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
OK.

644
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,200
It's locked! It's locked.
I need a crowbar or something.

645
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,000
Do you see one on the step?

646
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,400
You gotta be kidding me.

647
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,100
- Which way?
- Right, to the bedroom.

648
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,600
Aw, come on, Swink.

649
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,900
- I can't get in. It's locked.
- Wait. Wait. I have a key.

650
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,900
- This is...
- Insane. Now go!

651
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:01,900
Hutch!

652
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,900
- I don't think I'm gonna make it. Help me.
- I know. I see her.

653
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,400
Let me try something.

654
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,200
It's all right. It's all right.

655
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,100
It's OK.
It's all right. It's OK.

656
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,700
What happened?
Are you guys all right?

657
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,500
Yeah. You saved her life, man.

658
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,500
- Goddamn sweet!
- So. what now?

659
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,000
We need three nails. And one last thing.
Remember what October said.

660
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,200
The way to cleanse a witch's soul
is to burn her blood.

661
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,800
Wait. The roses. If you're gonna go
up there, you can't forget the wild roses.

662
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,700
- You never know, and I bet...

663
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,800
No! No!

664
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,300
Hell, yeah!

665
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,600
Swink!

666
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,100
Come on, you bitch.

667
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,900
Oh, shit.

668
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,200
Bitch, that's cheating!
I'm not dead yet.

669
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,500
Go!

670
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,200
- Swink!
- Swink!

671
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,000
- Swink!
- Help me!

672
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,500
Get away!
Get away from me!

673
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,600
Swink!

674
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,300
Hutch, I'm sorry.

675
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,000
OK, we're gonna need a hammer.

676
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,400
- Come on.
- Quick!

677
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,900
Open the door!

678
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,200
Hutch, come on.
Come on! Hutch!

679
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,500
Thanks, Swink.

680
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

681
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,200
It's OK. It's all right.

682
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
OK?

683
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,500
- I'm gonna go first. Stay right behind me.
- OK.

684
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,400
It's OK.

685
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,600
- Wait. Did you hear that?

686
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,200
OK. All right. All right, all right.

687
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,900
Come on.

688
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,100
This way. This way.

689
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,100
There should be a second door in here.

690
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,400
This should be the tower.
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

691
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,700
Hutch!

692
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,200
- It won't open.
- Oh, no! Open it!

693
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,200
OK. OK, wait, wait, wait. Let me think.
Let me think. I can get this open.

694
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,000
- How?
- I don't know. Just give me a second.

695
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,800
- Hutch. Hutch!
- It's just a... What?

696
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
We don't have the time!

697
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,600
Just think about it.
You gotta finish this.

698
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,200
No.

699
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,000
- Listen.
- I'm not leaving you.

700
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,600
Hutch.

701
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,200
I want you to go.

702
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,400
You're our only chance.

703
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
OK?

704
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,100
- This can't be happening.
- Well, it is.

705
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,200
I won't let her take you.

706
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,900
I know.

707
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,900
You be careful of that.

708
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,100
OK.

709
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,300
He loves me,

710
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,100
he loves me not.

711
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,500
He loves me,

712
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,300
he loves me not.

713
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,500
He loves me,

714
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,300
he loves me not.

715
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,800
He loves me...

716
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,400
Go away!

717
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,800
Go away!

718
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,500
No! Go away!

719
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,700
Hutch!

720
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,900
The broken mirrors - why? She
couldn't stand to see herself grow old.

721
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:19,800
It won't break like the others.
I think it's made out of silver or something.

722
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,000
Mom!

723
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,300
- Hutch!
- Come on! Move!

724
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,500
Come on, hurry.
Move! Come on, man!

725
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,900
- Move!
- Hutch!

726
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,800
Come on.
Come on, man! Come on!

727
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,700
Come on! Come on, Hutch!

728
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,800
Killer.

729
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,900
Come to me. clouds.

730
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,700
May you rise as an evil storm
born to rip them open.

731
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,400
Let the cover of night bear witness
and destroy those who resist

732
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:50,600
so they shall harm me not.

733
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,400
Let the blood of many cleanse me.

734
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,900
preserving beauty eternal.

735
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,400
I pray you.
