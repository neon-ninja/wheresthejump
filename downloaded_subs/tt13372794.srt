1
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,911
There we go.

2
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,539
Hands up.

3
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,335
Great. There we go.
Beautiful.

4
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,087
You remember what we did.

5
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,922
Higher, Mark.

6
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,215
Lovely. Ah.

7
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,426
To the side. Beautiful.

8
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,063
- Yay.
- Oh.

9
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,024
Aw, thank you.

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,946
- Sorry. I just gave away your piece.
- Who's next?

11
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,619
- Mom, take it easy.
- Oh, come on.

12
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,662
Kids keep us young.

13
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,583
Okay.

14
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,923
Are you okay?

15
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,552
Grandma.

16
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,264
- Are you okay, Grandma?
- Mom?

17
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,891
Somebody call an ambulance!

18
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,108
You don't
have to do this, Grandma.

19
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,695
Oh, I do. My health.

20
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,072
This'll be better for everyone,
believe me.

21
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:20,326
Hello. Welcome.

22
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,994
- You got it?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,996
This way, please.

24
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,165
It's a lovely second-floor room.

25
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,417
- You okay?
- Mm.

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,461
Here we are.

27
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,551
Oh. Hello there.

28
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,553
- Hi. Hi.
- I'm Liesel.

29
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,096
Uh, Judith.

30
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,431
Oh.

31
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,683
You didn't have to
unpack for me.

32
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,602
I could have done it myself.

33
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,188
Those are beautiful.

34
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,857
You were a professional dancer?

35
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,859
Mm, I dabbled.

36
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,152
Wow. I just...

37
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,612
Before I forget,
your medication...

38
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,364
For Parkinson's
and for your stroke...

39
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,657
Just leave it with me.

40
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,158
The nurses will
make sure you get

41
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,118
the right pills
for each meal or at bedtime.

42
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,120
Oh, I've always
managed myself, thank you.

43
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,581
Well, you'll no longer need
to worry about it now.

44
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,416
Isn't that a relief?

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,126
Perfect timing.

46
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,004
I need a new prescription,
actually.

47
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,465
At least it's quiet here.

48
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,841
That's good.
I'm a light sleeper.

49
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,468
Well, I'll leave you to it,

50
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,263
and let me know if there's
anything that you need.

51
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,933
Ms. Benson,
may I speak with you?

52
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,938
You don't belong here.

53
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,732
Oh, I'm 70, Josh.

54
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,859
Age is just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.

55
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,861
No, my darling.

56
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,864
That's just something old people
tell themselves to feel better.

57
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,408
Doesn't sound like you.

58
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,286
Age is what stops me
from dancing or teaching or...

59
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,289
keeping up pace with everybody.

60
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,709
You look younger than everyone here.

61
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,210
But you know what?

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,672
Every single one of these people
thinks the same.

63
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,091
We all still think we're 20.

64
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,218
I don't, I don't know how...

65
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:05,014
I don't know how
I'm gonna deal with this.

66
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,473
Well, can you deal...

67
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,058
Oh, what's that?

68
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,352
What? Oh! Stop!

69
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,979
Okay. Mom.

70
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,981
- We'll let you settle.
- Right.

71
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,733
Um... uh,
wh-why don't you go along?

72
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,235
I-I'll catch up later. It's...
You know, I'll just stay here

73
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,987
- for a little bit.
- Josh, you need to come with me.

74
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,405
Grandma needs to rest.

75
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,906
Call me if you need anything.

76
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,366
Sure.

77
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,868
Okay.

78
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,293
Don't worry. I'll be okay.

79
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,004
Bye, Grandma.

80
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,569
Tree.

81
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,912
Sorry. I didn't introduce myself.

82
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,289
Judith.

83
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,751
I guess we're roomies
like we're back in college.

84
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,924
Looks like I caught you
at a bad time.

85
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,634
Tree.

86
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm watching.

87
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,057
I'm watching, watching.

88
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,600
Looking for this?

89
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,976
Thanks.

90
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,562
I was just about to panic.

91
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,525
Of course, you know about
our no-cell-phone policy.

92
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,818
I-I'm sorry. What?

93
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,403
For the peace and quiet
of the house,

94
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,573
we don't allow any phones
anywhere in the building.

95
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,950
You're pulling my leg.

96
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,077
It was in the contract
that you signed.

97
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,331
So much for all the exciting
Insta updates

98
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,041
I could have posted from here.

99
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,055
I'm watching.

100
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,224
I'm watching. I'm watching.

101
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,488
She still hasn't texted back.

102
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,240
- I'm sure she's fine.
- She's fine?

103
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,908
Did you see her roommate and
the people she's staying with?

104
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:33,745
It's tough, but we have to
remember this was her choice.

105
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,957
You could've at least tried
to talk her out of it.

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,709
No one has ever
talked your grandma

107
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,044
out of anything
she's decided to do.

108
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,255
That's bullshit. You didn't
want to look after her.

109
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,048
She moved here
to take care of us

110
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,633
when we needed her the most.

111
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,011
- But now she needs help, she's out?
- That's not fair.

112
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,597
I'm gonna go watch a movie.

113
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,684
This is weird.

114
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,687
This may make you
a little tense.

115
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,981
It made someone
a little past tense.

116
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,735
Here's looking at you, kid.

117
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,826
No! Oh!

118
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,953
- Let go!
- That is enough.

119
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,622
- Imogen.
- Let go!

120
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,290
- It is time to go to bed. Come with me.
- I don't want to sleep!

121
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,750
Go away!

122
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,418
- Go away!
- No, this... Come with me right now!

123
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,961
- Go away!
- Please go back to bed.

124
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,713
No! Oh!

125
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,757
I want to go home!

126
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,342
You are home.

127
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,594
I want home. Please.

128
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,629
How are you today?

129
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,048
Would you like to visit
the grounds later?

130
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,759
I could make time for
a little stroll if you like.

131
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,428
- Oh, I'd love that.
- Okay, great.

132
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,688
I wasn't ready for this change.

133
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,147
I miss dancing,

134
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,191
and I miss it
more than anything else.

135
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,693
But my prognosis isn't good.

136
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,779
My symptoms are under control
for now, but...

137
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,490
who knows how long that'll last?

138
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,703
Whatever's coming next...

139
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:43,625
Whenever or however
I end up diminished...

140
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,045
I don't want my family
to see me like that.

141
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,841
Well, you look in great shape.

142
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,178
You want to see something fun?

143
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,014
Come on.

144
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,683
You okay?

145
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,060
Where the hell
are you taking me?

146
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,062
Been a while
since my last safari.

147
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,662
Well, this is it.

148
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,123
Wow.

149
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,002
Oh, it's beautiful.

150
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,628
Right?

151
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,715
You just wish you could sit here
with a good book.

152
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,134
Or-or curl up and nap
and dream of fairies.

153
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,845
What's this?

154
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,555
Damn kids.

155
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,807
They have these drunken
sleepovers on the grounds.

156
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,684
We've added a fence,

157
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,853
but now they cut their way
through with pliers.

158
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,855
Takes me back.

159
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,859
My friends and I had these
wild parties in the woods.

160
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,029
We'd smoke grass
and play guitar,

161
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,989
- dance around the fire.
- Mm.

162
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,200
It's where I met
my husband George.

163
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,284
Aw.

164
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,620
Life was easy then. Carefree.

165
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,372
An adventure.

166
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,088
What'd you find there?

167
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,339
Anyone you know?

168
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,133
No. I...

169
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,968
Probably not.

170
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,930
Come on.

171
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,058
We should probably head back
before they call a search party.

172
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,643
Hmm.

173
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,686
You should
find yourself a hobby here.

174
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,064
- Gardening?
- Oh.

175
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,607
There's lots of things to do.

176
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,528
Uh, watercolors, crafts,
even ballet.

177
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,571
Maybe something you'd enjoy.

178
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,198
Nope.

179
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,534
Who wants to see an old bat
fluttering about

180
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,452
in a leotard, anyway?

181
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,163
And here's our vegetable patch.

182
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,415
Liesel, hi.

183
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,624
Hi.

184
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,501
Oh, hello.

185
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,836
Ladies, this is Judith.

186
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,712
She just moved in last night.

187
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,465
- New blood.
- Yes, you don't say.

188
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,716
- Hi. I'm Ruth.
- Hi.

189
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,135
Oh, nice to meet you.

190
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,929
- Trish. Welcome.
- Thank you.

191
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,556
- A wormwood.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,849
Do you make absinthe?

193
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,517
Do you know much about plants?

194
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,687
No, but I, uh,
know a little about absinthe.

195
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,938
Ah.

196
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,568
Watch your step, young lady.

197
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,570
- Yeah.
- I didn't see you there.

198
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,029
I'm sorry, uh,
if I frightened you.

199
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,239
I'm Roland.

200
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,407
Oh. Uh, Judith.

201
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,992
I-I was just looking
at the, uh...

202
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,202
Well, yeah, don't mention it.
It's lovely to meet you.

203
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,579
I was planning

204
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,664
to come to you
later today to, uh...

205
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,375
Well, we have
a card group going,

206
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,044
and, uh, we're missing
a player for bridge.

207
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,963
Do you, by any chance, uh...

208
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,715
- Uh, bridge?
- What a cliché.

209
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,885
Uh, it's not as boring
as it sounds,

210
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,219
I promise you.

211
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,679
- Hmm?
- Uh...

212
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,264
Th-That... Yeah, sure.

213
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,016
- Oh?
- Sure, that'd be nice.

214
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,100
Lovely.

215
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,396
Nice to meet you all.

216
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,733
Yes.

217
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,234
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

218
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,944
Bye.

219
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,201
Attention, residents.

220
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,127
And plié.

221
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,463
Hmm.

222
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,549
Judith!

223
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,968
- Hi.
- So glad you could join us.

224
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,346
Yes, well, with this wealth
of exciting activity,

225
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,848
I wasn't sure I'd find time
in my schedule.

226
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,894
I, um, brought
a little something

227
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,563
- to get the party started.
- Oh.

228
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,689
Bring it on, sister.

229
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,775
Well, your spirit is
so visceral.

230
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,151
Wonderful.

231
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,445
Thank you, Judith.

232
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,658
So, first things first.

233
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,576
Any family?

234
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,662
Uh, my daughter and, um,

235
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,913
my grandson Josh.

236
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,122
He's 17.

237
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,416
Enjoy the visits,
if they do come.

238
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,628
I got to warn you,
they thin out quickly.

239
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,338
I hear you.

240
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,465
My friends deserted me
when I stopped being able

241
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,342
to teach their kids
how to dance.

242
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,010
- Uh-huh.
- But Josh will keep visiting.

243
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,720
He's the light of my life.

244
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,138
Keeps me young.

245
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,640
Does he? Really?

246
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,308
Well, his father died
when he was little,

247
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,936
and we were all affected,
of course,

248
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,314
but Josh, in particular,
just didn't know how to cope.

249
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,108
- Hmm.
- After a while, it was important

250
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,901
that he go back
to a normal life.

251
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,611
- You know, kids, fun.
- Mm, mm-hmm.

252
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,365
But his mother wasn't able
to provide that, so I...

253
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,159
Well, he and I grew very close.

254
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,204
A fact which his mother still
resents, I'm afraid, but...

255
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,999
Do you have family?

256
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,625
Oh, they're long gone.

257
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,462
Once you're here, you become,
uh, irrelevant to society.

258
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,339
You'd think we were in prison.

259
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,757
Well, we are on death row.

260
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,719
You married?

261
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,803
Oh, widowed.

262
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,763
- Oh.
- He was a good man

263
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,434
- and a great musician, and I do miss him.
- Mm-hmm.

264
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,768
You?

265
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,604
Same. I-I miss my wife.

266
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,649
Uh, it's good to have a
significant other in your life.

267
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,068
I sometimes think that the
toughest part of getting older

268
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:07,324
is that I might not get to see
the man Josh will become.

269
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,076
Geez, enough of
this depressing talk.

270
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,954
How do you like your new home?

271
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,207
- Uh, it takes time to adjust, right?
- Yeah. -Mm-hmm.

272
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,376
You've got to accept the change
and just move on.

273
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,086
- Right.
- People who don't,

274
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,547
they end up looking like, uh...

275
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,011
I-I can't cast the first stone.

276
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,263
I-I was a dancer, you know?

277
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,390
My-my work depended
on my youth...

278
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,059
Or the appearance of it, anyway.

279
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,770
I-I understand people's choices.

280
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,271
Well, I've had three face-lifts.

281
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,106
I've tried every fad diet.

282
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,691
Tried filler,

283
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,485
every Botox.

284
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,446
If I'd been told that "bathing
in the blood of virgins" stuff

285
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,866
actually worked, I'd have gone
the way of Elizabeth Báthory.

286
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,453
Oh.

287
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,080
Well, in the end,
there's only so long

288
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,706
you can hold the fort, right?

289
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,584
Fighting nature
always comes at a cost.

290
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,004
Wish you could recapture

291
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,422
the beauty of your youth?

292
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,800
Hebora, nighttime formula...

293
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,182
- No! No!
- In right here. Go.

294
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,351
No!

295
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,145
No, no.

296
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,897
Let me go!

297
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,566
- I don't want to go to sleep!
- Get her in the bed. Get her...

298
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,027
- No!
- You cannot sleep in the living room!

299
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,821
- No! No!
- Just relax.

300
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,988
Just relax.

301
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,865
No, no.

302
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,535
You're acting like a child!

303
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,837
Can I help you?

304
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,964
No, no. It's okay.

305
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,095
Don't you see him?

306
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,471
Pardon me?

307
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,473
Don't you see him?

308
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,226
He's watching us sleep.

309
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,310
Don't you see?

310
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,146
Are you talking about...

311
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,401
No.

312
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,278
It's okay. It's just Ozzie.

313
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,863
It doesn't mean anything, okay?

314
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,156
Look, see?

315
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,323
He's gone already.

316
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,913
Here.

317
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,642
My grandfather,
he had Alzheimer's

318
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,145
the last years of his life.

319
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:47,192
It was like little pieces
of his mind just...

320
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,194
falling apart one by one.

321
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,237
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,198
That's why I became a nurse.

323
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,284
I just wanted to help
make a difference.

324
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,620
My grandparents gave me this
when I was little.

325
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,330
Oh, nice.

326
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,209
I like to think that
they're watching over me.

327
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,963
Um, time for bed.

328
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,215
Uh...

329
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,306
What's that?

330
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,809
Oh, it's just something
to help you sleep.

331
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,394
We want to make sure
everyone has a good night.

332
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,146
You're drugging everyone.

333
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,314
Drugging?

334
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,441
That is awfully dramatic.

335
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,694
I know dealing with
screaming patients is hard,

336
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,073
but don't you think
your teammates are a bit rough?

337
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,200
We're all trained professionals,

338
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,411
and no one is sedated
against their will.

339
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,459
Look, don't worry,
it-it takes a bit of time,

340
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,921
but you'll fit right in.

341
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,530
No!

342
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,956
There! What is it?

343
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,583
Is she okay?

344
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,263
Where is he?

345
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,807
Are you having
a bad dream, Ms. Albright?

346
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,226
Fuck no.
He was standing right there.

347
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,978
Is that language
absolutely necessary?

348
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,230
- I'm not a child.
- Clearly not.

349
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,358
Good night, then.

350
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,098
Oh, Nurse, I...

351
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,724
Oh, it's you.

352
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,559
Do you need something?

353
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,019
Was anyone in my room
this morning?

354
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,187
My hairbrush is gone.

355
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,398
I wouldn't think so.

356
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,066
- Let me help you find it.
- I'm telling you,

357
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,693
someone took it.
It's gone.

358
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,319
Is this it?

359
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,407
Yes.

360
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,952
Yes.

361
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,412
You were probably
just distracted.

362
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,663
New habits.

363
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,625
People misplace objects here
all the time.

364
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,055
Whose turn was it?

365
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,559
Ah.

366
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,690
Easy one.

367
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,567
"At what job
do Wilbur and Chick work

368
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,902
in Abbott and Costello
Meet Frankenstein?"

369
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,612
Uh, baggage clerks.

370
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,948
Boom.

371
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,038
What's the deal with him?

372
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,373
Oh, he's here every day.

373
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,044
He keeps thinking his wife's
picking him up to go home.

374
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,254
Keeps forgetting
his wife's dead and buried.

375
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,048
Can you imagine?

376
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,466
He could've been a mob boss.

377
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,009
He could've trained dolphins
to become assassins

378
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,011
or... who knows?

379
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,514
But now... his mind's gone.

380
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,558
He's gone.

381
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,477
Geez, make me cry,
why don't you?

382
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,978
No, no. I'm-I'm serious.

383
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,189
I... It's the worst, I think.

384
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,900
Oh.

385
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,361
Worse than having to pull a
tapeworm out through your mouth?

386
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,281
Worse than your house keys
falling into dog shit?

387
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,741
Oh, way worse. Way worse.

388
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,535
Or getting tiny paper cuts
between each of your toes?

389
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,370
Oh, wait. Wait, wait.
Between your teeth.

390
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,705
Okay, okay, no, no, no.

391
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,957
Oh, God. Oh, what?
Oh, that...

392
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,293
No. You-you win. You win.

393
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,131
It's gonna get easier, right?

394
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,300
Boom.

395
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,601
Anyone there?

396
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,197
What are you doing
in the hallway?

397
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,740
You're supposed to be
in your room.

398
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,701
There was something
right there, on my bed.

399
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,452
Where the hell were you?
I called you.

400
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,871
You're not my only patient.

401
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,747
If you insist
on wandering about,

402
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,833
I'll have to lock your door.

403
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,710
Look.

404
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,588
It was right there.

405
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,423
What the hell? Let me go.

406
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,841
Calm down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

407
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,177
I can put myself to bed,
thank you very much.

408
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,888
Do you want me to call Gary
to come in here and assist me?

409
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,931
- He's right there in the hallway.
- He's there.

410
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,892
I knew it. He's the one.
Yeah, I knew it.

411
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,729
Gary has better things to do
than to lurk around your room.

412
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,565
It's just another nightmare.

413
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,651
Come on. Let's get you
back to sleep now, okay?

414
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,556
Annette.

415
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,434
Who is it?

416
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,811
You've seen him before.

417
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,232
Where's your crucifix?

418
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,917
Judith.

419
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,585
There you are.

420
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,879
- Hi. Thanks.
- Sit.

421
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,758
You look tired.

422
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,802
Speak for yourself.

423
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,888
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were hungover.

424
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,516
Where was the party?

425
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,559
Feeling better
from last night, I hope.

426
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,312
Quite the nightmare you had.

427
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,570
"Quite the nightmare you had."

428
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,448
- They all treat us like children.
- Right?

429
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,662
I wasn't having
a nightmare last night.

430
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,039
I was awake.
I saw something.

431
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,916
What was it?

432
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,461
Someone standing at the end
of my bed, watching me sleep.

433
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,338
And I know what you're thinking,

434
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,382
but the same thing happened
the night before.

435
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,718
Well, how clearly could you see?

436
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,761
Well, it was dark, but...

437
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,643
- Ms. Albright, how are you this morning?
- You.

438
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,186
Were you in my room last night?

439
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,564
- In your room? What are you...
- Around 1:00 a.m.

440
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:50,151
- What kind of creep watches women when they sleep?
- Uh...

441
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,527
And Annette's crucifix
is missing.

442
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,820
Is that what you do?
Steal from the elderly?

443
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,032
Uh, Judith,
the-the tea's getting cold.

444
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,242
This isn't achieving anything.

445
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,494
- All right.
- All right.

446
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,371
Okay.

447
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,250
I-I don't know what to do.

448
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,626
I mean, should I call
the police?

449
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,587
No, no, no.
Don't call the police.

450
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,965
Don't do anything dramatic.

451
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,843
Now, uh, you may be right,
and I-I don't like him, either,

452
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,054
but, Judith, everyone else,

453
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,431
not being able to distinguish

454
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,808
between what's real
and what's a dream,

455
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,518
that's a sign of dementia.

456
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:28,898
And they will have you diagnosed
and medicated in no time.

457
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,192
He's right. In their eyes,

458
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,487
none of us have both oars
in the water anyway.

459
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,780
Yeah, trust me.

460
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,907
The moment they see
any signs of illness,

461
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,242
they treat you like an invalid.

462
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,119
Look around you.

463
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,622
None of these people
are getting out of here.

464
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,665
Not for Thanksgiving,
not for Christmas,

465
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,418
not for their
grandkids' graduation.

466
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,296
Now, once they see weakness,

467
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,717
the only way you're getting
out of here is in a box.

468
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,982
Ms. Albright.
Is everything all right?

469
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,484
Oh, yes.

470
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,694
I'd just like to get some air.

471
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,655
Outside walks
must be accompanied.

472
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,240
What do you mean?

473
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,908
We're locked inside?

474
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,411
We need to know where
our residents are at all times.

475
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,831
Uh, some wouldn't be able
to make it back on their own.

476
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,541
Come with me.

477
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,252
We have a children's choir
recital in the living room.

478
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,547
I'd rather poke myself
in the eye.

479
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,925
Have a nice day, Ms. Albright.

480
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,341
George?

481
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,276
- How did you...
- It doesn't matter.

482
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,572
Come away with me.

483
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,283
This is no place for you.

484
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,922
Sorry.

485
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,507
I, um...

486
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,300
Um...

487
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,552
What was I...

488
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,970
Do... do I bid?

489
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,430
Bids are in.

490
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,516
Spades are up.

491
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,267
Are you okay?

492
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,061
Sure. Sure.
I think...

493
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,188
I must have been...
you know, I was dreaming.

494
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,690
- Uh-huh.
- For a minute there, I think.

495
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,068
Well, you'll adjust.

496
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,738
You'll find a... a new reason
to get up every morning.

497
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,449
Just give it time.

498
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,410
Look, we're all
in this together.

499
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,162
You know,
if ever you get the blues,

500
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,665
you just come see me and Ruth.

501
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,292
We're in the room
right next door.

502
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,995
Whoa. Oh.

503
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,581
What are you doing here?

504
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,499
Well, I thought that
we could prove to ourselves

505
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,917
we're not as old as we think.

506
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:18,752
- Roland.
- Oh, I was in my room,

507
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,714
and I thought about
that gorgeous woman

508
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,465
just across the hallway...

509
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,926
...and the connections
that we share.

510
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,305
And I thought that maybe...

511
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,681
No. No, no, no.

512
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,142
I-I mean, I really appreciate...

513
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,144
I mean, I'm flattered
by the attention,

514
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,271
but, um, I'm not ready for that.

515
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,480
Oh.

516
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,983
Ah, geez,
I got my signals crossed.

517
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,986
Listen, I-I... Sheesh.

518
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,155
I thought you'd be game.

519
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,407
- My apologies.
- Well, no harm done.

520
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,243
You move fast, Roland.

521
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,704
Let's not mention this,
all right?

522
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,080
All right.

523
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:57,333
Oh, cheese and crackers.

524
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:02,296
What a madhouse.

525
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,772
Who's there?

526
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,276
Roland?

527
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,044
Take a breath.

528
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,089
Another.

529
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,689
Uh, chick.

530
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,569
Uh, lemon.

531
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,572
Left hand.

532
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,242
The other hand.

533
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,876
I believe we are talking about

534
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,336
Parkinson's disease dementia.

535
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,339
I'm sorry, what?

536
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:10,841
It's not uncommon.

537
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,342
Hang on.

538
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,971
You can see dementia on the MRI?

539
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,973
I'm afraid so.

540
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,392
How can this be happening?

541
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,519
Would you mind waiting outside
for a moment, Ms. Albright?

542
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,022
I just have a detail or two
to settle with your daughter.

543
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,358
You're going to discuss
my treatment without me?

544
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,235
I'm not a child. I...

545
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:32,821
Ms. Albright, I-I understand
that this is a lot to take in,

546
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:37,159
but it would be easier
if you gave us a moment.

547
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,673
What can we do?

548
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,801
Your mother has complained
about vivid dreams

549
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,761
which she couldn't
differentiate from reality.

550
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,304
It's caused her to fall.

551
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,722
She needs
our constant supervision.

552
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,349
She'll be safer
here at the manor.

553
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,267
What's important
is that neither you

554
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,354
nor any member of your family
encourage her delusions.

555
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,357
She needs to understand
that her nightmares

556
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,025
are all in her head.

557
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,069
- Oh, God.
- Don't worry.

558
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,113
I've worked here
for over 20 years.

559
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,782
She's perfectly safe.

560
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,788
Listen to me. Listen to me.

561
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,749
Whatever I've seen at night,
it's real.

562
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,709
At first, I thought it was
a member of the staff,

563
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,003
but now I think...

564
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,215
Let me come home.

565
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,716
I mean, this clearly

566
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,260
is not working out for me.

567
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,262
Mom, I can't do that.

568
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,389
I can't go against
the doctor's advice.

569
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,349
Why won't you believe me?

570
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,060
Mom.

571
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,276
We all want you to feel better.

572
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,738
But, you know, you've always had
a vivid imagination.

573
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,200
We're all trying
to look after you.

574
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,245
I promise.

575
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,501
We'll see you soon, okay?

576
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,737
- Help me.
- What?

577
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,905
Help me get out.

578
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,489
- What?
- Imogen, come on.

579
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,700
- Let's go inside. Okay?
- Oh.

580
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,327
Come on.

581
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,916
- There you are.
- Sweetheart.

582
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,052
What's on your mind?

583
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,138
I don't want to worry you.

584
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,389
Then it's bad.

585
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,517
This place...

586
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,895
Being surrounded
by all these sick old people...

587
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,563
Makes me feel like I'm...

588
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,398
So, this must be the grandson.

589
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,151
Hi. I'm Roland. I'm a friend
of your grandmother's.

590
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,945
- Hi.
- I hope.

591
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,072
Anyway,
I heard a lot about you.

592
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,658
Hey.

593
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,993
I'll let you two catch up.

594
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,330
Hey, he seems cool.

595
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,581
Yeah, he is cool.

596
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,459
But we play cards
with his friends, and...

597
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,877
Don't judge.

598
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,673
Mm.

599
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,218
I better go.

600
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,765
You know, I'd-I'd really like
to get out this weekend.

601
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,308
Could you two pick me up?

602
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:52,938
Let's go for a, you know,
Sunday lunch or movie or...

603
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,856
Uh, no, I-I don't think...

604
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,984
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

605
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,151
Why?

606
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,028
They say you'll settle faster

607
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,907
if you don't go home right now,
so, you know,

608
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,117
maybe hang with
your-your new friend.

609
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,660
Roland, right? Yeah.

610
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,537
"They say"?

611
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,914
You listen to them now?

612
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:14,668
Do you know they won't even
give me the code to go out?

613
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,713
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

614
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,798
I'm such a wet blanket
right now.

615
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,174
Come back later, okay?

616
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,474
Your ticket out.

617
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,187
Good boy.

618
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,564
I'll be back tomorrow.

619
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,050
Are you guys...

620
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,720
Hang on.
Are you smoking grass?

621
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,764
Uh, no.

622
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,515
- No.
- Oh, my God, you...

623
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,392
you are smoking grass.

624
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:13,977
It's-it's purely medicinal.

625
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,772
- And that's the end of it. Sorry.
- Yeah.

626
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,315
Did you grow it?

627
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,484
- Is that why you have to...
- Uh, well...

628
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,029
Whoa.

629
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,698
How long have you two
lived here?

630
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:29,659
I mean, you've almost made it
into a home.

631
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:30,994
Oh, it's a mess.

632
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,330
We've been going through
some old clothes.

633
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,582
- Yes.
- Oh, really? May I?

634
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,000
Sure. Have a look.

635
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,211
See if there's
anything you like.

636
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,422
Really?

637
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,091
Were you 20 when you moved in?

638
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,842
- Oh, no.
- Sure feels like it.

639
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,179
Oh.

640
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,223
- This had to be you.
- Oh, yeah.

641
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,935
Oh, you can have that.

642
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,367
Your roommate is not
looking too good.

643
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,328
Mm-hmm, she had a turn
for the worse last night.

644
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,041
What's going on?

645
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,711
No. Off, kitty.

646
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,133
- Off you go.
- Shoo. You're scaring everyone.

647
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,759
I don't understand.

648
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,553
What's the deal with the cat?

649
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,139
I've seen Annette freak out
about it before.

650
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,515
Ozzie, the poor kitty.

651
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,351
He can sense who's about to die.

652
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,644
Cats are smart that way.

653
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,021
I mean, we may have
one foot in the grave,

654
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,858
but nobody wants to be
the next to go.

655
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,199
Annette.

656
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,326
Are you okay?

657
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,915
The doctor insists you take this
to help you relax tonight.

658
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,543
Insists? Why?

659
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,212
Residents get a little agitated

660
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,132
when Ozzie, um, misbehaves.

661
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,801
I don't need to be sedated,
thank you very much.

662
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,053
It might help with those dreams
you've been having.

663
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,264
Hey.

664
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,809
Did Annette ever say
what she saw in her nightmares?

665
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,605
Please take the pill, Judith.
You'll sleep better.

666
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,995
We've been marked.

667
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,081
You won't be saved.

668
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,375
Find it.

669
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,921
Annette! Annette!

670
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:31,007
Help us! Somebody!

671
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,884
Annette.

672
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,556
Holy shit, Annette.

673
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,811
Oh.

674
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,896
Annette.

675
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,898
Annette. Annette.

676
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,984
Gary, get the doctor quick.

677
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,652
Come on. Come on, Annette.

678
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,029
Are you okay?

679
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,447
Oh, God.

680
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,700
Annette? Hon?

681
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,128
I'm so sorry
you had to see this.

682
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,965
Will you be all right in here
for the night?

683
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,591
Okay.

684
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,414
"Find it"?

685
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,207
Find what?

686
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,205
Oh, fuck this.

687
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,180
Oh, thank Christ.

688
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,483
Shit.

689
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,531
Oh, you're squeezing
my arm too tight.

690
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,074
What are you doing there?

691
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:45,118
- Whoa, no.
- Oh, careful. You're...

692
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,204
- I don't think that I'm...
- Wait a minute.

693
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:51,958
I heard something.
Did you hear that?

694
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,006
Come on.
I'm freezing my ass off.

695
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,758
- Let's go.
- Oh, all right.

696
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:03,511
- You're so cranky.
- Oh. If you were a real gentleman,

697
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,680
- you'd give me your jacket.
- Really?

698
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,577
You eat your eggs with a fork?

699
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,787
I don't have a fork.

700
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,873
Have you seen Judith today?

701
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,458
Uh, no.

702
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,834
Can't say that I have.

703
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:36,044
Hmm.

704
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,338
Judith?

705
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,173
Ms. Albright?

706
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,765
Ms. Albright is MIA.

707
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,146
Shit. There she is.

708
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,194
Oh, am I glad to see you.

709
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,906
Yes, we found her, thank God.

710
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,824
How could this happen?

711
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:09,160
What do you mean, no harm done?

712
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:11,871
For Christ's sake,
she's not even dressed.

713
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,336
Josh.

714
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,213
I have to tell you something,

715
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:23,466
but you have to promise
you'll keep an open mind, okay?

716
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:25,885
Sure. Sure.

717
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:31,558
I think there's something out
there in that house killing us.

718
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,018
Wait. Wh-What?

719
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,021
Look at these names.

720
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:40,275
Annette, my roommate,
she died last night.

721
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,319
All the others above her name
have died, too.

722
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:46,197
I don't know who
or what it is, but...

723
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,243
Imogen's next, and then me.

724
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,744
Help me.

725
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,080
I need to get out of that place.

726
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,211
All this proves is that

727
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:02,630
whoever wrote this
was really paranoid.

728
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:08,011
God, why does everyone
treat me like I'm crazy?

729
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,429
Even you.

730
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,432
Remember when you were little

731
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,642
and I used to chase the monsters
out from under your bed,

732
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,477
and I'd listen to your stories,
and I'd listen

733
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,188
to your fears and your excuses
when you came home late?

734
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:22,066
I have faith in you.

735
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,861
Can't you have
the same faith in me?

736
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,914
Mom, you... you can't
do this again, ever.

737
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:41,085
If Ms. Benson hadn't called us,
if-if we hadn't found you...

738
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,212
I'm not a prisoner.
I shouldn't be locked up.

739
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:44,881
It's the rules.
You agreed when you signed them.

740
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,675
I didn't agree to have
my freedom taken away from me.

741
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,218
I'm not gonna
take you home, Mom.

742
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,638
You wanted a Sunday lunch,
fine, but the doctor...

743
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:52,805
That doctor's a charlatan.

744
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,307
I won't go back.

745
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,600
"The doctor's a charlatan."

746
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:56,726
All right, that's enough.

747
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,562
I'm your mother, not your child.

748
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:02,065
I'll be right back.

749
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,316
End of discussion.

750
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,030
She's clearly not happy there.

751
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,990
I think we should take her home.

752
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,867
They warned me about this.

753
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,912
I don't want to make things
worse than they already are.

754
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,538
Worse?

755
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,248
How can things be worse?

756
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,793
Open your eyes. Can't you see
the state she's in?

757
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,252
Honey, I know Grandma's scared.

758
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,462
I know she's worried.

759
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,922
We all are.

760
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,216
This is a difficult time
for everybody.

761
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,470
Dad would know what to do.

762
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,768
Josh, you should know, um...

763
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,731
She's not doing so well.

764
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:50,446
What do you mean?

765
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,581
Oh, shit.

766
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,419
Mom, they've come
to pick you up.

767
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,920
No. No. No.

768
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,046
- This way.
- No, Barbara, look.

769
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,715
- Look-look at this picture.
- Come on.

770
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,466
Leave me alone. I-I'm not crazy!

771
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,343
- Just look at the damn picture!
- Keep walking this way.

772
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:13,845
- Come on. -Yeah, okay.
- I don't want to go back!

773
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,263
How can you do this to me?

774
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,557
I'm your mother!
I'm your mother!

775
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,560
- Calm down.
- How can you do this?

776
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,548
Hey.

777
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,463
Roland Benson.

778
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,465
Ms. Benson.

779
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:40,473
Trish Price and Gary Price.

780
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,183
What the fuck?

781
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:46,395
Ruth Cooper and Elizabeth.

782
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:06,833
Annette.

783
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,710
Imogen.

784
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,520
What the hell?

785
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,039
This is Josh.

786
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:48,457
You know what to do.

787
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:52,545
Josh. Come here
as soon as you get this.

788
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,423
It's-it's very important.
Please.

789
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,220
...you as well.
I'm heading into my office.

790
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:03,472
Let me take a look
at the calendar.

791
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:07,393
We don't have any rooms
available right now, I'm afraid,

792
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,854
but I should have an opening...

793
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,772
in about a week.

794
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,651
I'll send the application
right away.

795
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:16,944
Okay.

796
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,321
Of course.

797
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,989
Thank you. Bye.

798
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,535
I was... I was just...

799
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,078
I know. I was...

800
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:28,581
Liesel, come in, please.

801
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,296
I need you to check
the medication for 312.

802
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,967
Okay, perfect. Yeah.

803
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,803
I actually did check...

804
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,104
Oh, God.

805
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,409
Oh, Josh.

806
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:07,787
- You okay?
- Oh, thank God you're here.

807
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,455
I have to get out.

808
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:10,957
No, again?

809
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,711
I know who's killing people.

810
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,213
It's Roland.

811
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,131
- Wait, the-the old guy you play cards with?
- Yeah, I...

812
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,299
I thought you liked him.

813
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,176
I'm in danger.

814
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,053
I haven't seen Imogen
since yesterday.

815
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,680
I'm next on the list.

816
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,057
Okay, okay, why don't you speak
to the director, then?

817
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,017
- She can help.
- No, she's his daughter.

818
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,560
Or his granddaughter.

819
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,187
- I mean, she's in on it.
- In on what?

820
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,606
These so-called nightmares
I've been having,

821
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,274
this man's behind them.

822
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,693
And his friends, too.

823
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,736
And they're all related
to members of the staff.

824
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,321
Isn't that weird?

825
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,741
Yeah, that's super weird.

826
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,326
- Yeah.
- Wait.

827
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,662
I-I thought you said
what you saw wasn't human.

828
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:53,124
Oh.

829
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,501
No, no, it's not them.

830
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,380
Or it could be.

831
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,424
It-it could be they-they turn...

832
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:05,553
turning at night
into something... else.

833
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,971
I don't... I'm confused.

834
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,348
I don't know...
What are you talking about?

835
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:15,312
I saw Roland in a photograph
at the diner in the hallway.

836
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,774
He looked exactly the same
40 years ago.

837
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:24,113
Oh, I know it sounds insane,
but it's the truth.

838
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,948
Um...

839
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:30,119
The doctors said...

840
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:35,750
...you might try to convince us
that you're seeing stuff.

841
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,337
Is that what you believe?

842
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,716
That I'm crazy?

843
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,678
He says you-you have...

844
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,891
Dementia?

845
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,269
That doctor's a crook.

846
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,731
And he's part of the conspiracy,
and I can prove it.

847
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,193
Where the hell...

848
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,236
What are you looking for?

849
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,738
The file.

850
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,114
What file?

851
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,658
It's gone.
It was... it was right there.

852
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:10,785
Somebody took it.

853
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,787
- What was it?
- My brain scan.

854
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,998
And-and those of others here
diagnosed with the same disease.

855
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,501
All exactly identical.

856
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,753
They're fake, Josh.

857
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,672
Brain scans?

858
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,841
How-how do you even know...

859
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,677
that they're brain scans and
if they're slightly different

860
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,805
and-and someone...
someone took them?

861
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,518
I hate to say this,
but it sounds bonkers.

862
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,235
You're right.

863
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,156
I should be going.
I should get back.

864
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,908
You only just arrived.

865
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,577
Yeah, I got to be home
for dinner.

866
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,542
Will you be coming back
tomorrow?

867
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,377
Tomorrow? I-I don't think so.

868
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,170
I, um...

869
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:06,340
I'm s-swamped this week, so I...

870
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,175
Next week, for sure.

871
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:10,136
Next week.

872
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,805
Yeah.

873
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,938
Good night, Grandma.

874
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,630
Time for bed.

875
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,716
Oh, not yet.

876
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,636
It's very late.

877
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,769
Wait, what's that?

878
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,607
Well, I've been asked
to restrain you.

879
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,983
Whoa, no. No, no.

880
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,610
Look, Judith,
it's for your own good.

881
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,361
So you won't fall out of the bed

882
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:12,239
- if you have nightmares.
- I said no. No.

883
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:14,158
Let go. Stop it.

884
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,284
No.

885
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,077
No, you don't touch me.

886
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,537
- Not you.
- Judith, Judith, calm down.

887
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:20,706
- No! No! Stop!
- Judith, get your feet together.

888
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,041
- Please just...
- Stop it!

889
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,626
- Please just hold her down. Please...
- Get off me!

890
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,085
- Get the fuck off me!
- Please, Judith.

891
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,463
- Get off me!
- Calm down!

892
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,006
- Judith, you need to calm down.
- No, I don't want this!

893
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,799
- Calm down right now. Calm down.
- Stop! -Judith. Wait.

894
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:33,302
No!

895
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,721
Good.

896
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,601
You said you wanted
to help people.

897
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,521
Your grandfather's real proud
of you, don't you think?

898
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:54,323
I once heard
Dr. Geoghegan say that

899
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,700
when you've experienced
something disorienting,

900
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:59,662
you should close your eyes
and count to five.

901
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,872
When you open them again,

902
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:04,708
whatever you saw or heard
will be gone.

903
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,836
Seriously?

904
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,297
Count to five?

905
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:12,883
What the fuck
kind of advice is that?

906
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,701
- I believe you.
- What?

907
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,911
But you're gonna
have to stay like this

908
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,037
and play along tonight.

909
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:43,831
I'm being watched.

910
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,582
But I know what's going on.

911
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,961
I'll check in on you,
and we'll talk in the morning.

912
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,170
- Okay?
- Yeah.

913
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:51,755
Okay.

914
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,959
Oh, my God!

915
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:31,211
Help! Help me!

916
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,589
Somebody help!

917
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,051
Help me!

918
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:43,390
Oh, my God, they're right.
I'm going crazy.

919
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,309
Oh, my God!

920
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,022
One.

921
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,274
Two.

922
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,569
Three.

923
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,862
Four.

924
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,447
Five.

925
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,293
Good morning, Judith.

926
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,170
Oh.

927
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,263
Oh, where's Liesel?

928
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,808
Oh, she won't
be back for a while.

929
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,518
She said she'd be here.

930
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,561
She's on sick leave.

931
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,023
What?

932
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:34,817
- I'm sorry.
- No.

933
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,444
I know you two get along.

934
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:40,322
Hopefully, you and I
can be friends, huh?

935
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,743
Imogen.

936
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:27,870
Help me get out.

937
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,037
Imogen, let's go.

938
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,207
Imogen.

939
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:37,296
Out and up to fifth position

940
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,839
and around.

941
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,595
Beautiful, class.

942
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,484
Oh, no.

943
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,904
No.

944
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,369
- -I've seen it...
- The photos on the wall

945
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,621
and these-these
friends of yours.

946
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:36,206
Look. Look.

947
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,711
Thought it might mean something,
so I looked it up on-online.

948
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,547
It-it's a Celtic sigil,
representing an oak tree.

949
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,675
A symbol of-of longevity
and regeneration.

950
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:49,094
Like-like a tree of life.
Do you understand?

951
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,430
- Celtic?
- Yeah.

952
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,056
- So?
- So... you were right.

953
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,766
You're not going crazy.

954
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,686
You're right.

955
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,563
There is something
going on here.

956
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,316
I-I don't know what it is,
but it's some Wicker Man magic.

957
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,654
But I-I don't think you should
stick around and find out.

958
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:12,159
Well, I can't...
I can't just leave.

959
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:15,203
I... We have to do something.

960
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,913
Go to the police.

961
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,373
No, we-we need evidence.

962
01:05:18,457 --> 01:05:21,293
Trust me, they won't
believe us without it.

963
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:26,131
I'm s... I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

964
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:30,177
Oh.

965
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,511
Come on.

966
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:34,598
Let's go before the nurse
starts her rounds.

967
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,851
Let's start with Roland.

968
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:56,411
Roland?

969
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,461
- You watch the door.
- Okay.

970
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:09,383
What are we looking for?

971
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,260
Anything incriminating.

972
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:13,637
Like what?

973
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,015
I don't know.
Cauldron, broomstick.

974
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,393
Just let me know
if anyone shows up.

975
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,739
Oh, my God. The scans.

976
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:34,783
Yeah.

977
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:39,871
I knew it.

978
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:43,333
I knew I didn't lose
my hairbrush.

979
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,460
What is that?

980
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,465
Oh, gross. Is that his?

981
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,050
Quite sure it's mine.

982
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:54,803
Oh, my God, what a perv.

983
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:58,223
Wait a minute.

984
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:00,642
Shit, shit, shit.

985
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:06,064
Someone's coming. Come on,
come on, come on. Under the bed.

986
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:08,400
Hurry.

987
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,319
Hurry up.

988
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,572
Come on. Hurry up.

989
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:16,843
No! What are you doing?

990
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:17,969
Fuck.

991
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:20,013
Roland?

992
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:27,229
Where the...

993
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,814
Where the fuck did he go?

994
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,148
Oy, language.

995
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:32,025
Hey, "language" yourself.
You cuss plenty.

996
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,735
Yeah, well, I fucking earned it.

997
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:36,029
You're 17.

998
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,454
Oh, my God.

999
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:47,082
Holy shit.

1000
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,458
What the hell was that?

1001
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,085
- It'll be all right.
- What-what was that?

1002
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,920
We have to follow them.

1003
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:53,964
I think I know where he's going.

1004
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,507
Do you know the new code?

1005
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,092
- I-I-I do, but, um...
- Yeah.

1006
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,426
Let's not waste time.

1007
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,053
We got to get moving.

1008
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,805
- Now.
- What the f...?

1009
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,066
This way.

1010
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,211
Pass me your cell phone.

1011
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,180
My grandparents gave me this.

1012
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,474
I'm being watched,
but I know what's going on.

1013
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:47,601
She's on sick leave.

1014
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,352
Oh, Liesel.

1015
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:30,518
Turn off your light.

1016
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,104
Before we go any further,

1017
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:36,191
if anything goes wrong...
Anything...

1018
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,610
I want you to run away
as fast as you can.

1019
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:42,530
I can't run, but I don't have
as much to lose.

1020
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,032
- No, no, no. I am not...
- You...

1021
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,867
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1022
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,913
I'm the Wilbur to your Chick.

1023
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:54,459
Fine.

1024
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,255
All right, let's do this.

1025
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:17,190
They're witches.
They're fucking witches.

1026
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,566
Holy shit.

1027
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,610
So they are.

1028
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,749
Lord of the forest,
we welcome you unto us.

1029
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,501
Into this circle we are bound.

1030
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:40,630
We refuse the degradation
of our bodies.

1031
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:44,092
Allow us to once again feed
upon the weak,

1032
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:46,386
through your minion,

1033
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:49,014
to absorb their energies
and replenish ours,

1034
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:51,349
to thrive
through their ill health

1035
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,643
and live beyond their death.

1036
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:58,231
Oh, tree of life,
send your minion to feed for us

1037
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:02,444
and extract
the last remaining energy

1038
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,696
of Judith Albright.

1039
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:05,822
No!

1040
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,115
Josh, no!

1041
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:11,286
No! Let him go!

1042
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:18,251
Judith, I knew
from the beginning

1043
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,211
you were a vivacious one.

1044
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:21,296
Help!

1045
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:22,881
There's no one here to help.

1046
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,341
- Why are you doing this?
- Isn't it obvious?

1047
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:28,094
I watched my wife
lose her mind bit by bit

1048
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:31,139
until she couldn't recognize
our grandchild.

1049
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,475
I'm not gonna
go through that ever.

1050
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,268
What about the people you kill?

1051
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,229
Their sacrificed souls
keep us going.

1052
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:39,939
They already had
one foot in the grave.

1053
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:44,235
If you're going to cheat death,
you got to pay the price.

1054
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,531
But from midnight until dawn,
the witching hour,

1055
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:51,201
I get to be young again
every night.

1056
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,871
Those kids I saw in the woods...
They were you.

1057
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,125
Incredible.

1058
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,960
This is nothing personal.

1059
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:03,922
Judith, you'll excuse the...
the cliché.

1060
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:06,132
I really like you, but...

1061
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:08,468
- you can't make an omelet without...
- No.

1062
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,512
...breaking a few eggs.

1063
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,182
No!

1064
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,209
No!

1065
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:12,365
No. I don't understand.

1066
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,826
It's your fucking hair, Roland.

1067
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:51,696
Oh.

1068
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:55,325
Let him go,

1069
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,869
or I swear I'll trim this fucker
into kindling.

1070
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,662
No!

1071
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:00,872
Judith, wait!

1072
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:03,625
It doesn't have to end this way.

1073
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,919
There's another way.

1074
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,963
We welcome you among us.

1075
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:11,299
Both of you.

1076
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,426
You can destroy that tree,

1077
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,804
and then sit
and wait to slowly die alone

1078
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,015
with all the other people
in that house.

1079
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:22,810
And you, young man,
you can watch her fall apart,

1080
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:26,564
lose her mind,
no longer recognize you.

1081
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:32,946
Or you can join us
and be young again.

1082
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,532
Healthy, vibrant forever.

1083
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:39,410
Think of the happiest time
in your life,

1084
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:42,038
when everything was exciting,

1085
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:45,166
you had a purpose,
you were loved.

1086
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,377
Think of all that you've lost.

1087
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,421
Remember that feeling,
those happy times.

1088
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:54,384
How easy it all was,
how carefree.

1089
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,970
We can give that all
back to you.

1090
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,846
And you have a young person...

1091
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,225
Like my Elizabeth
or Trish's Gary...

1092
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,352
Who can help you
and keep your secret.

1093
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:07,272
It's a perfect partnership.

1094
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:09,899
All those poor people.

1095
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:12,819
Imogen, Annette,
God knows how many others.

1096
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:16,906
The lives you sacrificed.

1097
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:18,116
Are they really living?

1098
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,492
They merely exist.

1099
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,743
They're awaiting death.

1100
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,245
They're ghosts.

1101
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,331
That's your future, Judith.

1102
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,375
Can't you see?

1103
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:31,045
We're just cutting short
their suffering.

1104
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:33,423
It's a mercy.

1105
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,467
The price to pay
is very small, really.

1106
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:39,429
And what other choice
do you have?

1107
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:43,141
A useless existence
in a broken body.

1108
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,101
Think about it, Judith.

1109
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,936
No more limping.

1110
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,857
No more pain, no more disease.

1111
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,234
We dance, Judith.

1112
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:56,571
We dance every night.

1113
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,614
Just think of it.

1114
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:05,246
And you, young man,

1115
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,749
will never have to know
the anguish

1116
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:11,252
of watching your loved one
slip away.

1117
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:14,464
Or die, like your father.

1118
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:17,592
Remember how hard that was?

1119
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:21,095
And how your grandmother
was there for you?

1120
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:26,559
Who will be there
for you, Josh, when she dies?

1121
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:30,271
Judith, do it for Josh.

1122
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:33,649
Grandma, please.

1123
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:37,195
Don't leave me alone.

1124
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:49,767
Oh, Barbara.

1125
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:51,936
- Come here, sweetie.
- Happy birthday.

1126
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:53,479
Aw.

1127
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:55,731
Josh, sweetheart.

1128
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:58,192
Mm.

1129
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:00,862
Isn't it the wrong birthday?

1130
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:03,823
Oh.

1131
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:07,493
We thought they'd remind you
of the past.

1132
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:09,245
Oh, that's wonderful.

1133
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:10,329
Oh.

1134
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,165
My grandson, everyone.

1135
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,833
He's joining the staff here.

1136
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,501
Isn't that great?

1137
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,378
He keeps me young.

1138
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:19,964
Oh, anybody want cake?

1139
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,258
Let's all have some.
