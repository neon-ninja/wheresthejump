1
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,070
Mm. Oh, yeah, baby.

2
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,766
Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,448
I'm gonna take a shower.

4
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,153

00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,689

16
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,345
Huh. Looks like Erik Henson's home.

17
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,311
Yeah. I heard he left his
wife for some college student.

18
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,155
He might be living here full time now.

19
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,825
Oh, that's a shame.

20
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,320
We're so isolated up here,
it might be nice to have a neighbor.

21
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,430
I guess.

22
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,827
I got this.
Okay.

23
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:05,833
That's funny.

24
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,705
What?

25
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,705
It's open.

26
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,655
Doesn't look like
anyone's been in here.

27
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:25,721
Oh, you know, I bet the workmen left the
door open last time they were here.

28
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,835
I'll get the groceries out of the car
and check on the furnace.

29
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,256
So your parents are pretty waded, right?

30
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,419
Yeah, I guess.

31
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:02,458
My dad retired from KPG last year, and
he got an insane severance package.

32
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,637
Wait, KPG?
As in, the defense contractor?

33
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,533
Yeah.

34
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,032
He was just in marketing, though.

35
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,536
Why?

36
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,208
Is that a problem for you, babe?

37
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,815
Having dinner with fascists?

38
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,043
No. No. I want to meet your family.

39
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,088
I hope this means there's gonna be
some good booze at your place, though.

40
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:32,058
Probably not.
My mom's on medication.

41
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,734
Can we stop somewhere
and get some, then?

42
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,496
Yes, we should. Good call. Heh.
Yes

43
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,365
Hey, I lit the furnace. Sorry.

44
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,764
You okay?

45
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,369
Were you just upstairs?

46
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,877
No, I was in the basement.

47
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,440
Did you hear that, just now?

48
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:27,808
Hear what?
I heard footsteps.

49
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,445
I think someone's in the house.
Are you sure?

50
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,351
Paul, we gotta get out of here!

51
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,851
Aubrey.
Hurry up!

52
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,360
No. You go outside.
I'm gonna check the upstairs.

53
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,896
You come outside with me!
It's a creaky old house.

54
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,693
Paul! There is someone up there!

55
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,208
I'll take this with me. Okay?
Are you happy?

56
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,571
No!

57
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,338
All right. You wait outside.
I'll be out in a minute.

58
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,676
Careful.
I will.

59
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,178
Hello?

60
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,819
Oh!

61
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,650
Crispian!
Dad.

62
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,623
You scared the shit out of me!
Yeah.

63
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,197
Oh, God.

64
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,526
Not to get off
on the wrong foot here,

65
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,533
but why is Mom
in the driveway crying?

66
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,308
Oh, God. Come with me.

67
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,494
Hey.

68
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,199
You Okay?

69
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,170
Crispian and I looked in every room on
the second floor. There's nobody there.

70
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,537
Oh, God.

71
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,910
I'm so silly.

72
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,748
Honey. I'm sorry.
No. No.

73
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,753
- You're embarrassed.
- No, I'm not.

74
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,822
- You must be Erin.
- Yes.

75
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,652
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

76
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,261
Glad you could make it.
Yeah, thanks for having me.

77
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,987
Hey, you. Come here.

78
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,000
It's okay.

79
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,733
Oh, we brought whiskey.

80
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,499
Well, come on in.

81
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,175
We'll be there in a minute.

82
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,443
Heh. What's going on?

83
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,210
I... I... Don't ask. I don't know.

84
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,459
So your dad bought this place
to fix up?

85
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:39,727
Yeah. Supposed to be
his retirement project,

86
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,907
something for him to work on,
but I'm pretty sure so far

87
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,940
he's just paid other people
to work on it.

88
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,445
Hey!

89
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,247
You're gonna break this bed.
It's like a hundred years old.

90
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,443
Sorry. Your folks seem cool.

91
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,780
I mean, for people with money.
You're lucky.

92
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,122
I guess.
No, you are.

93
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,320
You don't know what most people would
give to have folks like yours.

94
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,664
Whatever that means.

95
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,662
Come here.

96
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,668
So your brothers and sister
get in tomorrow?

97
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,439
Yeah. Tomorrow is my parents'
actual anniversary.

98
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,779
Thirty-five years,
can you imagine?

99
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,352
No. I can't, really.

100
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,651
Well, I look forward to meeting
the rest of your family tomorrow.

101
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,924
They're something.

102
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,698
It's been a long time
since we've all been together

103
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,631
so it should be interesting.

104
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,432
How so?

105
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,174
You'll see.

106
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,890
Not in person?
It's crazy.

107
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,251
- Not in person.
- Like old black and white videos.

108
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,236
You've seen them.
You've seen the videos.

109
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,899
But when they stand up, they're taller
than you, and if they've got baby...

110
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,545
I feel like kangaroos fight guys
named Gentleman Jack.

111
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,373
It's serious.
Like, twisty, curly.

112
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,947
Hey.
How you doing?

113
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,412
Morning. Good morning.

114
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,244
Good morning.
Hey, buddy.

115
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,944
You ever see kangaroos fight?

116
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,214
- Stop!
- Okay, okay.

117
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,982
Kelly?
Do some funny little...

118
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,414
- Up on their tails?
- Okay.

119
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,493
Ow! Don't hit me.

120
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,595
Stop it. Come on.

121
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,329
Pussy.
Don't.

122
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,159
You almost hit my face.

123
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,494
Crispian...

124
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,792
Don't kiss him. Don't
kiss my wife. It's rude.

125
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,603
Ugh. Gross! That is sick.
Thank you.

126
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,831
Come here and kiss me.

127
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,509
- Oh, I'm sorry. He's your brother.
- Yeah.

128
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,110
I'm not allowed
to kiss your brother.

129
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,609
Reminds me of when you were a kid.
You should've seen him.

130
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,341
No, you shouldn't have.
Oh, yeah?

131
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,417
Yeah. He was like a little chubby angel.

132
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,986
- Really?
- A little cherub.

133
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,850
Yeah.
I was always a little chubby.

134
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,525
He says "only a little chubby."
I have a round face.

135
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,285
That doesn't mean I'm fat.
It doesn't mean he's fat.

136
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,405
- It means you're beautiful.
- All the fat on him means he's fat.

137
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,966
- Don't go just by his face.
- I'm not fat.

138
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,781
Hey.

139
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,623
Oh, hello.

140
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,158
Um, I was just wondering if you need
any help in here with anything.

141
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,066
I think I'm all set.

142
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,529
Okay.
Actually... Erin?

143
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,799
Yeah?
I am out of milk.

144
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,969
Oh. Uh, okay.

145
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,415
Could you go over
to the neighbor's house

146
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,175
and see if he has some?
His name's Erik.

147
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,012
Okay.

148
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,513
Well, I'll be right back.

149
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,545
How's this look, Drake?

150
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,427
Beautiful. Great color.

151
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,102
- Grain looks nice, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

152
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,929
I don't know about this grain.

153
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,730
What's going on over here?
Work.

154
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,333
Hey, babe.

155
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,375
Boys. You look so adorable.

156
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,842
Can you hold that?

157
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,681
Ready?

158
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,951
Beautiful.
Come join us, Erin.

159
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,554
Your mom just asked me
to go to your neighbor's

160
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,520
to see if I could borrow some milk.

161
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:02,784
- Really?
- Yeah.

162
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,983
All right.
I'll be back in a minute.

163
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,357
- Sounds like your mom.
- That's right.

164
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,401
Don't start.
Don't start with me.

165
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,964
I'm gonna go check on Kelly.

166
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,205
- Looks so good, Dad.
- Thanks, Drake.

167
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,643
So how'd that fellowship thing
turn out?

168
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,785
Oh. Uh...

169
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,822
Not so good.

170
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,155
No?

171
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,987
No. Uh...

172
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,222
I guess there were a lot of applicants
this year, and...

173
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,260
I haven't exactly been
published recently, so...

174
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,170
Well, there are some people
that aren't published

175
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,636
that do get the fellowship,
you know.

176
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,645
Shut the door.

177
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,924
Where'd your brother
find that girl?

178
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,999
I don't know. Student?
Former student?

179
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,465
Huh.

180
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,428
Current student.

181
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,605
I'll bet she's kind of annoying.

182
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,874
Accent's just, like,
so jarring to me.

183
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,573
Hey, I lit the furnace. Sorry.

184
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,972
You okay?

185
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,576
Were you just upstairs?

186
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,084
No, I was in the basement.

187
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,647
Did you hear that, just now?

188
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:16,015
Hear what?
I heard footsteps.

189
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,653
I think someone's in the house.
Are you sure?

190
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,559
Paul, we gotta get out of here!

191
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,059
Aubrey.
Hurry up!

192
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,567
No. You go outside.
I'm gonna check the upstairs.

193
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,104
You come outside with me!
It's a creaky old house.

194
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,900
Paul! There is someone up there!

195
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,874
Babe, don't.

196
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:45,347
Okay. I don't...
I'm not feeling this right now, okay?

197
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,519
Don't give me that look.

198
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,033
Do you have any Vicodin?

199
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,464
Yeah. It's in my purse.

Hi, Mommy!

211
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,204
Oh, honey.

212
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,377
Look at you! You are so beautiful.

213
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,167
- Thank you. I lost a little weight.
- You look great.

214
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,153
- Thank you.
- You must be Tariq.

215
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,325
- Yes. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

216
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,624
My little Felix.
Hi, Mom.

217
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,223
I'd like you to meet Zee,
my girlfriend.

218
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,726
Zee?

219
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,699
With two E's. Z-E-E.

220
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,238
Wow. That's unique.
Nice to meet you, Zee.

221
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,403
Come on inside, everyone.
Come in.

222
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,475
Where's Crispian?

223
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,516
Did he bring his new girlfriend?

224
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,486
- This is my boyfriend.
- Hi.

225
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,925
Crispian.
How you doing?

226
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,359
- You must be Erin.
- Yes.

227
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,762
- Oh, my gosh. You're so beautiful.
Oh-ho-ho.

228
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,904
Thank you!
Hey. Good to see you.

229
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,937
You're Erin?
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

230
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,336
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.
Oh. And, Zee, right?

231
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,738
Erin.
I know.

232
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,880
- Hey, where's my princess?
- Daddy!

233
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,911
This is my boyfriend, Tariq.

234
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,610
How are you? Welcome.
Nice to meet you. Thank you.

235
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,083
Who'd like a glass of wine?

236
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,621
I would.
I'll take some wine.

237
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,622
Let me take care of that right now. Felix.
Dad.

238
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,692
I just want you all to know

239
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,791
how much it means
to us that you're all here. So...

240
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,931
Thank you for coming.

241
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,371
Oh. She's so cute. I'm in love.
Shh.

242
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,282
Let's bow our heads.

243
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,486
Dear Heavenly Father,

244
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,325
we thank thee for thy food.

245
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,633
Feed our souls on the bread of life,

246
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,271
and help us to do our part,
with kind words

247
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,441
and loving deeds. Amen.

248
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,405
Amen.

249
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,636
And thanks to Mom and Dad.

250
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,242
For having us ah here together.

251
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,112
It's our measure.

252
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,484
Um, so, Tariq, what do you do?

253
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,524
Uh, ahem. I'm a filmmaker.

254
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,593
- Is that right?
- Yeah. He's really good.

255
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,595
I don't think I know any filmmakers.
That is so...

256
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,665
- interesting.
- There's not a lot of us.

257
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,837
Have you been on TV?
Not on TV.

258
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,505
I've only made one documentary,

259
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,800
it was at the Cleveland Underground
Film Festival, 2008.

260
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,705
What is an underground
film festival?

261
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,140
Do they show the movies
underground?

262
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,508
No, no. They show them
aboveground, but they...

263
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,342
They show intellectual films.

264
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,519
So like an
intellectual film festival?

265
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,120
Do you do commercials?
Because those are my favorite,

266
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,191
No, he doesn't do commercials.
Mm-mm. No.

267
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,657
Really? I just think that is just the
height of the art form these days.

268
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,852
It is just short and punchy,

269
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,464
you really gotta just Zing the ideas
on in there.

270
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,998
That's why I watch TV.
I just think it's so...

271
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,635
it's better than the shows now.

272
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,998
He makes documentaries, so...
it's different.

273
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,970
Yeah, but I think that I've seen
documentary commercials.

274
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:35,543
I don't think they have to be
limited to any particular thing.

275
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:41,207
It's not a... You know, I mean, the starving-artist
thing just never made sense to me.

276
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:44,980
- I just think you should consider it, Tariq.
- Sure.

277
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,380
That's no fair!

278
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,923
Give ii back.
That was mine.

279
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,888
Stealer.

280
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,655
So, Erin, are you still in school?
Um... Heh.

281
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,231
Yes. I am. I'm in my final year.

282
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,096
I'm finishing my Master's.

283
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,593
- That's great, good for you.
- In what?

284
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:02,999
In literature.

285
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:07,166
Wow.
So were you a student of Crispian's?

286
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:10,779
I was. But I'm not anymore.

287
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,209
Not anymore.
Mm-mm.

288
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,782
She was my TA,

289
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,284
but we stopped, because we figured
that that was inappropriate,

290
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,753
It's a little unprofessional.

291
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,552
What?

292
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,894
What's that?

293
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,192
What you just said.
What was that?

294
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,132
About what?
You said it's unprofessional.

295
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,963
Is there something else
you wanted to say to me?

296
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,642
No, I was just agreeing with you.
You weren't agreeing with me.

297
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,442
I mean, I... What he...?

298
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,137
I thought he said it was unprofessional?
Don't look at her. I'm right here.

299
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,474
Crispian.
What?

300
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,548
We're having a dinner here.

301
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,913
I'm having a conversation
with my brother.

302
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,954
Is there something that you wanna say,
because I feel like...

303
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,285
I don't know what you want.
I don't think that you're in any position

304
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,962
to be judging my moral decisions.
Who says I'm judging you?

305
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:02,098
You are, with your eyes.
It's a big semantics conversation.

306
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,527
The whole time you've been here

307
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,798
you've been needling me,
and I'm not putting up with it.

308
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,472
You are so jealous of me.
I'm jealous of you?

309
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,642
Do we have to do this at the dinner table
right now? Please, I...

310
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,808
I'm jealous of you?

311
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,005
Always been jealous of me.
What have I done?

312
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,625
- Who have I been jealous of?
- I make more money than you.

313
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:30,119
Every time we have dinner,
you have to argue like this?

314
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,825
Pam, can you get a handle
on these boys?

315
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,425
Crispian, your mother's upset.

316
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,665
What the fuck is that?

317
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,333
Look in the mirror!

318
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,304
You look like The Elephant Man.

319
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,988
What can you not?
What can you not believe?

320
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,708
Go ahead and tell me what
you can possibly not believe.

321
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,548
What could come out of your mouth that's interesting
or of merit or value? I mean, I've had enough.

322
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,404
Ow! Aah!

323
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,144
Oh, my God!

324
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,351
Oh, my God! Aah!

325
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,160
Help me. Crispian!

326
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,420
Help me get her up.
We have to get out of here!

327
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,686
Aimee, no!

328
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,727
Mom, get down! Get
away from the window!

329
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,760
- Aah!
- Drake!

330
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,942
Is he all right?

331
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,668
Oh, my God!

332
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,077
Aubrey, get down!

333
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,750
Get down, get down, get down!

334
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,215
- Stay down, stay down!
- Get down, get down!

335
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,914
Stay away from the windows.
Get down!

336
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,891
Crispian! Get Drake, get over here.

337
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,617
Drake! Stay down!

338
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,191
Someone fucking do something!

339
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,423
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

340
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:21,071
Look at me. You're gonna be fine, okay?
Just stay down. Okay. We gotta call 911.

341
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,235
We're all gonna die!

342
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:26,099
I don't have a signal.
I don't have one, either.

343
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,869
Does anybody have a signal?
I had a signal today.

344
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,981
I was able to use the phone today!
Dad! Dad, they must be using a jammer.

345
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,616
What?
A cell-phone blocker.

346
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,878
They're illegal, but you can get them
on the Internet for 30 bucks.

347
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,453
Felix, you fucking low-life!

348
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,558
What are you calling me a low-life for?
I'm just trying to hem,

349
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:45,558
That's no fucking surprise
you're into that sketchy shit!

350
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:53,460
Oh, my God! We're gonna fucking die!
Oh, my God!

351
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,333
Crispian, grab your brother,
carry him out of this room!

352
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,302
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

353
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,272
Okay. You're gonna grab this chair.

354
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,312
Get yourself out of here!
Cover your face and run!

355
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,851
Stay low! Go!

356
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,256
Aimee, go!
Grab the chair! Go!

357
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,864
Aubrey? Aubrey?
Aubrey, Aubrey.

358
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,193
No, I can't! No!

359
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,667
I'm here with you. It's gonna
be okay. Come on. Let's go! Ready?

360
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,032
Go, go, go!
Come on.

361
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,217
- We have to pull this out, right?
- Yes.

362
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,196
- Somebody pull it out! Pull xl out!
- Maybe we should...

363
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,027
No, no, no, no.
No clipping, no pulling.

364
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:01,397
Can you just gently place your hands
over the wound slightly? That's it.

365
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,301
- Breathe!
- No, no, no, no. Don't do it.

366
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,307
- No. Stop!
- I'm sorry.

367
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,036
Drugs, babe! Find me drugs!

368
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:15,082
- My purse. Someone hand me my purse.
- Stop moving! Aw, fuck!

369
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,857
- Keep your hands on it, please!
- No, don't! Oh!

370
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,424
Stop!

371
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,869
Oh, my God.
What is happening to us?

372
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,403
What the hell is going on?
I have no fucking idea.

373
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,041
Dad, do you see anyone?
I don't. Do you see anyone?

374
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,733
No.
Somebody should make a run

375
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,372
for the cars.
And try to go get help!

376
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,071
No! We can't go out there.

377
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,772
It's the only way.
It's the only way we're out of this.

378
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,007
Whoever's the fastest runner.
Who is that?

379
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,915
I'm the fastest, but I've got this
fucking arrow in my back.

380
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,522
What does your shoulder have
to do with your legs? I'm the fastest.

381
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,751
He has a fucking arrow in his back!
Stop yelling at me, Kelly!

382
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,759
How the fuck do you know it has to do with
your legs if you never run, you fat fuck?

383
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,558
I'm not fat anymore! Damn it!
Shut the fuck up!

384
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,568
I'm the fastest! You guys never
give me any credit for anything!

385
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,868
Look, it's not about that.
Nobody needs to run.

386
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,545
We need to all stay inside.
You don't believe in me!

387
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,715
Honey, we believe in you.
We believe in you.

388
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,475
I can run three miles in 23 minutes.
I'm gonna do it.

389
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,947
- Aimee, no! No!
- Aimee, you can do this.

390
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,280
I believe in you, okay?

391
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:28,287
Just get out where you can make
a phone call to get help.

392
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,051
Zee, help me move this.
Help me get this out of the way.

393
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,819
Felix!

394
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,264
I can do this, Daddy.
Get down!

395
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,630
We'll pull the doors open
at the last second.

396
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:43,500
They're not gonna be expecting her
to be coming out full speed.

397
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,518
Help us! Help me!

398
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,191
Get her inside! Help me! Baby!

399
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,385
What happened? What happened?

400
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,699
Aimee!

401
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,267
Oh, my God. My baby!

402
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,988
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, no!

403
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,925
Oh, my God!

404
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:21,837
Oh, no. My God.

405
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,917
Erin!

406
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,082
What are you doing?

407
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:48,857
We need to make sure all the doors
and the windows are locked.

408
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,465
What?

409
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,270
Babe. Hey. What are you doing?

410
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,209
Some places, if you text 911,
they get it as a voice-mail.

411
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,815
If you even have one bar
you can send a text. Come on!

412
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,450
Those things are useless.

413
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,745
I'll have to keep trying.

414
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,091
Okay, the second floor is clear.

415
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,489
- Should be safer than down here.
- Aubrey, come on.

416
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,163
- Come on. Come on.
- No.

417
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,263
Oh, my God, no.
I'm taking her upstairs.

418
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,661
That's a good idea.

419
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,138
Drake, we need to take care
of this shoulder.

420
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:36,002
It's fine. I can't feel it anymore.
Are you sure?

421
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,269
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

422
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,312
Okay, we're all gonna
get out of this.

423
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,850
We need to cover up
and lock all the windows.

424
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:50,687
I've never seen you act like this before.
Well, it's a unique situation.

425
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,327
We still need someone to go
and try to get some help.

426
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,431
We should stay in and look everything,
and wait till the police come.

427
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,932
In fact, we should hang a sign out
an upstairs window, SOS or something.

428
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,106
That's a good idea.
I can pull a sheet off the bed upstairs.

429
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,371
We're almost there. Come on.

430
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,351
Stay with me.

431
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,854
I have to go check on the kids.

432
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,307
Get out of the way! Move!

433
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,208
Oh, my God.

434
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,545
Mom.

435
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:14,127
Oh, no. No! No! No! Oh, God! No!

436
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,562
No! Aubrey! No!

437
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,796
Oh, no! No!

438
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,219
I have to go see her.
I have to go see her!

439
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:47,419
Dad, Dad. No. Stay down here.

440
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,424
Stay down here with us.

441
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,766
Why would anybody do this?

442
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,843
Oh, my God!

443
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,419
Kelly!
No, Drake!

444
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,188
- Drake!
- Kelly!

445
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:32,966
Fuck!

446
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,374
What happened?

447
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:54,048
Help! Somebody help me!

448
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:02,361
Somebody help! Help me!

449
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,668
- Can you grab a rag?
- Yeah, okay.

450
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:16,677
Maybe we should try to run.
I mean, Kelly made it.

451
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,711
At least get to a car or something.

452
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,476
I'll try. I'll try. You guys stay here.

453
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,246
No, no, no. Wait. I'll come with you.
Zee, hold this.

454
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,561
But we'd have to carry Drake.
And Dad...

455
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:37,432
He... He can't run right now.

456
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,336
I'll go get the car.
I'll bring it right up to the front door.

457
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:45,906
Then you and Felix and Zee
carry Drake and Dad out.

458
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,667
Make sense?

459
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,608
Babe, it'll be okay.

460
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,908
I can do this.

461
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,085
It'll be just a second.

462
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,185
Honey?

463
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,623
Take this.

480
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:06,031
I think it's safe to assume
the other cars are out, but...

481
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,540
I didn't see anybody out there.

482
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:13,545
Maybe Kelly...
Maybe she got past them.

483
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:16,150
I mean, it gives us a chance.
What do you mean?

484
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,047
I'm going back out there.

485
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,489
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

486
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,787
Yeah. I mean, I didn't see anyone.
Maybe it's over.

487
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,091
Wait, so what, you're just gonna leave
the rest of us here?

488
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,659
Clearly, we need some help, man.

489
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,168
We need to get somebody out there,
in here.

490
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,771
I'm gonna go to the neighbor's.

491
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,434
As soon as I'm a safe distance away,
I'll try to text and call.

492
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,844
You guys stay in here.
Keep each other safe.

493
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,420
I'll come back. I'll come right back.

494
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,681
Wait, Crispian.

495
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,419
Don't go. I'm serious.

496
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,032
Everything's gonna be fine
out there.

497
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,474
You just stay in here.

498
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,337
Take care of yourself.

499
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,944
I'll come back soon, okay? Okay?

500
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,954
You promise?

501
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:29,987
I promise.

502
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,997
See you soon.

503
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,715
I think it's safe to say
at least one of them is already inside.

504
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,688
You think the person who killed my wife
is still in this house?

505
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,161
I'd assume so, yeah.

506
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:12,763
How is he, Zee?

507
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,770
Looks like the bleeding stopped.

508
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,834
Let's get him in there,
hide him someplace safe.

509
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,737
Felix, can you give us a hand?

510
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,077
On three. One, two, three.

511
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,862
What's the best room
for us all to be in?

512
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,861
All the rooms have windows
in them, except for the basement.

513
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,431
No, the basement's a bad idea.

514
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:48,467
They could just pour gas down the
stairs and throw in a match.

515
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,936
We should stay in there and keep boarding
up the windows. Shit, speaking of.

516
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,837
Okay, we should each carry a weapon.

517
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,154
So your dad bought this place
to fix up?

518
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,389
Yeah. Supposed to be
his retirement project,

519
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:26,568
something for him to work on,
but I'm pretty sure so far

520
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,634
he's just paid other people
to work on it.

521
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,140
Hey!

522
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,909
You're gonna break this bed.
It's like a hundred years old.

523
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,138
Sorry. Your folks seem cool.

524
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,476
I mean, for people with money.
You're lucky.

525
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,817
I guess.
No, you are.

526
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:50,015
You don't know what most people would
give to have folks like yours.

527
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,359
Whatever that means.

528
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,357
Come here.

529
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,363
So your brothers and sister
get in tomorrow?

530
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:09,101
Yeah. Tomorrow is my parents'
actual anniversary.

531
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,441
Thirty-five years,
can you imagine?

532
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,047
No. I can't, really.

533
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:57,648
Anyone know this guy?

534
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,096
Although it's kind of hard to tell.

535
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:30,151
Hey. I'm sure Crispian's fine.

536
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,957
Crispian's a tough guy.

537
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:36,029
No, he's not, but thanks.

538
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,956
Thanks for the help, by the way.

539
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,693
Hey, you...
You seemed to have a handle on it.

540
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,268
Yeah, don't worry about it.

541
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,840
Hey, where's your dad?

542
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,087
Where's the circuit box?

543
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,658
I don't know.
I think it's in the basement.

544
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,889
Why don't you go look for it? I'm gonna
go upstairs and try to find my clad.

545
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,552
Oh!
Dad!

546
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:15,787
Felix!

547
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:22,035
One of them was in the bedroom.

548
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:25,635
They've been watching us for days.

549
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,365
While we were sleeping.

550
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,477
This wasn't a random attack, Felix.
Dad, it's okay.

551
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:32,408
Yeah.
Calm down.

552
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,107
You understand what I'm saying?
Our family is being targeted.

553
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:36,308
Really? You had to do that
right in front of me?

554
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,607
Are you saying something?

555
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,978
Yeah, you know what? Never mind.

556
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,155
You Okay?

557
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:51,054
Yeah. I just...

558
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:56,222
I just need to get washed up.

559
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,720
Hey.

560
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,219
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

561
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,550
I woke up in there.

562
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,319
Yeah. You blacked out.

563
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,420
We put you there to hide you.

564
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,425
Thanks.

565
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,990
Welcome.

566
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:33,105
Where's Kelly?

567
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,167
Uh...

568
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,501
I don't know.

569
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,447
Are you guys okay?
What's going on?

570
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,983
We heard noises,
so we stayed upstairs.

571
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,813
What happened?

572
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,449
One of them came in
and attacked us.

573
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:52,154
I stabbed him and he ran away.
Come on.

574
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:55,159
- You stabbed him?
- Yeah.

575
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:57,764
Do you think you
might have killed him?

576
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,627
No, he ran out the door.

577
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,334
Was there anyone upstairs?

578
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:03,698
We didn't find anyone.

579
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:06,339
Whoever was there
could have climbed out the window.

580
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,436
Is your dad okay?

581
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:14,377
Yeah. He...
He just needed to lie down.

582
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,309
How many of them
do you think there are?

583
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,287
There'd have to be
at least two more of them.

584
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,986
Well, maybe they're gone.
Maybe you scared them off.

585
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:32,058
Come here.
Let's not count on that. Come on.

586
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:35,395
There's some tools left in the basement
that I think we could use.

587
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,036
Let's head down there.

588
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,409
Okay. Grab anything sharp or heavy
that might make a good weapon

589
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:46,842
but you need to do it fast.
We've gotta be upstairs.

590
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,717
Yeah, let's go through Dad's tools.

591
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,545
There's plenty of stuff
we could use there.

592
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,549
Zee, can you grab these?

593
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,418
Okay. That'll be enough
to get started.

594
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:59,388
Let's go. And don't take too long!

595
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,920
Drake doesn't need
to see her like this.

596
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,531
Zee, let me show you
something quickly?

597
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,214
Okay, so you just want to make sure

598
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,383
that the nail goes all the way through.

599
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,418
See that?
Mm-hm.

600
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:31,590
Just do, say, four or five on this one?

601
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,920
And we'll just do as many as we can.

602
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,596
Okay.

603
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,431
Can I ask you something?

604
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,029
How did you learn all this stuff?

605
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,264
Well, I had kind of a Weird childhood.

606
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:48,739
I grew up on a survivalist compound.

607
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,213
I haven't even told Crispian that yet.

608
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,638
Good answer.

609
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:02,483
Well, I guess when I was born,
my dad got kind of paranoid.

610
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,483
He was convinced that the world

611
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:07,718
was gonna run out of resources
in a matter of years.

612
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:14,063
Found a lot of guys who agreed with
him, and we all moved to the Outback.

613
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:18,068
Basically, if things got too
overpopulated, even out there,

614
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,969
he wanted me to be able
to take care of myself.

615
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,572
Moved to the States
with Mom when I was 15

616
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:28,511
but I learned a lot beforehand.

617
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,921
Wow. That's crazy.

618
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,431
Got some things here.

619
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,033
So nobody knows where Crispian is?

620
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:55,866
No, he... He ran out
right after Kelly did.

621
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,370
All right. I gotta go look for them.

622
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:05,886
I at least have to try.
I can't leave Kelly out there.

623
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:13,291
What do you mean?
Drake, Kelly's dead.

624
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,228
What?

625
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,867
Kelly's dead.
You didn't know that?

626
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,506
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

627
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,905
I didn't want to have to tell you
like this, but she got killed.

628
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:32,579
Her body's up there
on the floor right now.

629
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,878
Drake, I'm sorry. I...
Shut up! Felix!

630
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:43,649
I know you cared about her.
Shut up! Shut up! Stop talking!

631
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,401
I'm sorry.

632
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:21,857
Would you just die already?

633
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,622
This is hard enough for me.

634
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,195
Mm-hm.
Finished that one?

635
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,760
Cool. You know, it might not be a
bad idea to do at least one more.

636
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,838
I'm gonna go check
on their dad upstairs.

637
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,475
When the boys come up,
make sure they have some rope.

638
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,144
Uh, I can do it. I can go.

639
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,639
Do you wanna come with me?
We can go together.

640
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,884
No, that's okay.
I'll just do another board.

641
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,878
Okay. Be careful.

642
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:32,557
Oh! Oh, fuck!

643
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:38,603
Oh! Oh, you motherfucker!
Oh, fuck!

644
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,334
Hey. Would you
mind checking on that?

645
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,238
I believe this is
what I'm paying you for.

646
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,152
Uh, thanks.

647
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,436
What a fucking disaster.

648
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:18,008
It's okay, baby. It'll be over soon.

649
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,556
I'm not really in the mood
right new, Zee.

650
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:37,562
Come on. I'll make it quick.

651
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:43,526
I want you to fuck me on this bed,
next to your dead mom.

652
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:46,707
What? Why would you even
say something like that?

653
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,374
You never want to do
anything interesting.

654
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,375
I don't think that's a fair criticism.

655
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:56,572
Fuck me next to
your dead mom, then.

656
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,046
This conversation is over.

657
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,265
Hm.

658
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:26,877
Oh! Fuck. Unh!

659
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,380
Whoa, whoa, wait! Don't do that!

660
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,682
You don't want your DNA
in here, man.

661
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:39,893
I'll clean it up later.

662
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,619
Just like the rest
of this fucking mess.

663
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:46,629
Excuse me?
You say that like it's my fault.

664
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:49,698
Listen. Just so we're perfectly clear.

665
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,599
I just had to kill my own brother

666
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,638
because you guys keep
getting beat up by some girl!

667
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:58,107
I had to stab my brother,
more than once!

668
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:01,544
You were supposed to do that.
For all the good you guys did in here,

669
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,741
you could have stayed outside
with your fucking crossbows!

670
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:07,310
You wanna talk about brothers?

671
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:11,386
That's my brother,
laying dead right there.

672
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:14,962
And unlike you,
I liked my brother.

673
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:17,893
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

674
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,296
I mean,
I knew you guys served together.

675
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,662
I didn't know
you were related, though.

676
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,765
Man, she really fucked him up good,
huh?

677
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:32,305
I'm just trying to think of reasons

678
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:33,946
why I shouldn't kill you!

679
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:38,614
I'll... I'll pay you more.

680
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,116
What's that?

681
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,684
You kill me, you get nothing.

682
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:48,486
You pull this off, I'll give you 400,000.

683
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:52,029
Okay? I was supposed
to give you 2, right?

684
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:56,031
But you should have your brother's share.
That's only fair.

685
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:59,034
Plus, I'M throw in an extra 100. Each.

686
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:02,970
If we can finish this. Okay?
That's half a million for you.

687
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,669
And 300,000 for you. I'm looking at, uh...

688
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:13,011
I won't... I won't be able to pay you
until my inheritance comes through

689
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:17,988
but I'll have it soon.
We just need to finish this!

690
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,330
We did make it this far, man.

691
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,869
You two better be getting
enough money to pay us!

692
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,739
Would I be doing this if I wasn't?

693
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,411
I got it.

694
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,761
Get up! Get after her! Get after her!

695
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:01,247
Hell, the cops could be driving here
right now, for all we know.

696
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:04,907
What it they come across her down the road?
Did you even think about that?

697
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,347
You need to calm down.

698
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:10,422
Don't fucking tell me to calm down, Tom.
This entire situation is out of control.

699
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:12,388
We don't even know
what's going on.

700
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,758
She's hurt.
She's not faster than us.

701
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:19,865
You stick to the road. You don't
see her, you come back here.

702
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,932
Well, where are you going?

703
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,104
Back to the house
to check on Craig

704
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,773
and to make sure
she's not doubling back.

705
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,465
Wait, give us the crossbow.

706
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,807
Look, you got your machete.
We don't have any weapons.

707
01:19:34,038 --> 01:19:35,903
What are you standing there for?
Give it to me!

708
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:40,085
You know how to use that thing?
I know how to fucking use it.

709
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,654
I pull the trigger, arrow shoots, right?

710
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,291
Two bolts. Two shots.

711
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:50,794
You see her, you make it count.

712
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,090
Of course.

713
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,852
Shit.

714
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,176
What the fuck?

715
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:35,651
I fucking hit her, didn't I? Get in there.

716
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:39,150
Give me the crossbow.

717
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:40,960
Come on!

718
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,322
All right. I'm right behind you.

719
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,793
Okay.

720
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,395
Goddamn it.

721
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,349
Fuck!

722
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:44,220
It's not even hot,
you dumb bitch. Whoa!

723
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:03,891
<i>Felix?</i>

724
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:09,029
<i>Hey. Felix, is it all done
in there or what?</i>

725
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:12,505
<i>I saw my signal came back.
Is it over?</i>

726
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:19,043
Look, I know you're pissed at me
for not helping out.

727
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:23,272
I just... I couldn't do it, man. I...
I told you this might happen.

728
01:27:25,107 --> 01:27:29,681
I saw Mom, and the blood,
and you know I'm a pacifist.

729
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:32,256
I can't... I can't deal
with the violent stuff.

730
01:27:33,949 --> 01:27:37,419
Come on, now. I can hear you breathing
on the other end of the phone.

731
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:41,567
Felix?

732
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:46,970
It's... It's fucking freezing out here.
I'm coming inside.

733
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:01,448
Felix?

734
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:07,324
Felix?

735
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:21,505
Erin.

736
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,568
You're okay.

737
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:36,183
Where's Felix?

738
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:40,288
I stuck a blender in his head
and killed him.

739
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,761
Oh.

740
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:46,161
Okay.

741
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:48,356
I can't believe you were in on this.

742
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,671
Come on, babe. You do know
how broke we are, right?

743
01:28:56,198 --> 01:28:57,768
You would have killed me.

744
01:28:57,966 --> 01:29:00,446
No! That was never
supposed to happen.

745
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:04,048
Even if you hadn't meant to kill me,
you must have known I could have died.

746
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:05,342
No.

747
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,554
You were supposed to
be the witness.

748
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,484
A person with a clean record

749
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,888
that could attest that our family
and neighbors had been murdered

750
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:15,856
by unknown lunatics.

751
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:20,659
It was, in fact, a very important part
of my plan that you be unharmed.

752
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:25,531
We needed someone with no motive
to see what had happened here.

753
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,706
Someone other than Zee,
obviously.

754
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:34,841
Where is Zee?

755
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,413
I killed her too.

756
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:40,720
Oh.

757
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:43,587
Totally understand.

758
01:29:45,981 --> 01:29:51,431
Listen. I'm sorry
things got so out of control,

759
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:55,328
but how were we
supposed to know

760
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:59,437
that you were really good
at killing people?

761
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:02,835
Which is actually sort of weird,
by the way.

762
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:06,408
Had you reacted, um, normally,

763
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:09,241
my parents and siblings
would have been killed,

764
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:11,007
you'd have been untouched...

765
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,746
and we'd be rich.

766
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:17,788
We'd be on our way to,
like, a vacation in Paris.

767
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:21,955
Maybe an engagement?

768
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:24,896
Okay. Okay.

769
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:28,630
There is a silver lining here,
by the way.

770
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:32,395
I'm now the sole inheritor
of my family's estate.

771
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:36,565
We're talking millions, babe.
You. Me.

772
01:30:37,132 --> 01:30:38,736
Us.

773
01:30:41,703 --> 01:30:42,977
Look.

774
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:47,618
Regardless of
our current situation...

775
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:51,986
or whatever
we're going through right now...

776
01:30:53,148 --> 01:30:56,789
it would be insane
to throw that away.

777
01:30:56,985 --> 01:30:59,295
I mean, look at all
that would be wasted.

778
01:31:00,655 --> 01:31:06,230
I understand it might take a while
to make this up to you.

779
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:10,605
But in the meantime,
let's think about this logically.

780
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:13,445
I know you've got
your student loans.

781
01:31:14,002 --> 01:31:16,915
How would $500,000 go towards
fixing that problem?

782
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:19,676
You could quit your bartending job,
just study full time.

783
01:31:19,908 --> 01:31:21,581
You know you hate that job.

784
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:24,256
You could have 500,000
within the month.

785
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:30,988
Or I go to jail...

786
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:33,190
and you get nothing.

787
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,026
Hey.

788
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:40,372
I love you.

789
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:46,639
I promised you that
I'd come back, didn't I?

790
01:31:49,037 --> 01:31:50,607
Here I am.

791
01:32:07,122 --> 01:32:09,033
Why?

792
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:11,033
Why the fuck not?

793
01:32:30,512 --> 01:32:32,014
Oh, fuck.

794
01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:58,077
We need medic and backup
immediately at 5 Edelweiss Drive.

795
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:32,117
