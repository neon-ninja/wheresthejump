created by aksub

2
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,703
I remembered a joke.

3
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,538
It's funny.

4
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,081
Okay.

5
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,126
Seorg and his wife
were having sex one night,

6
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,921
when their young son
suddenly enters the room.

7
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,423
Hang on a sec.
Are we going in the right direction?

8
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,675
Olav!

9
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,055
What are we looking for?

10
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,432
Just keep going.

11
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,936
A little bit more or else
we will be flagged on the site.

12
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,897
Okay.
Continue the joke.

13
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:32,152
The boy gets scared and leaves
running from the room, crying.

14
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,697
The mother says, "Honey!
Now, what should we do? "

15
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,199
You know women...

16
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,953
The father says:
"Let me handle this".

17
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,415
Then he leaves
and goes to the child's bedroom

18
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,959
to say he was joking.

19
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,877
He opens the door and sees
the small bastard

20
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,840
is lying on top of his grandmother,
having sex with her!

21
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,760
Very animated too, rises and falls,
up and down.

22
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,221
Then he looks
for the father and says:

23
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,639
What's wrong, Dad?

24
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,183
You play with mine
so I play with her, right?

25
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,232
Stop!

26
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,866
Is it here?

27
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,038
It's right here.

28
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,772
Don't move!

29
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,244
Turn on the light.

30
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,550
Oh, my God!

31
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,540
Kate!

32
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,126
- Shit.
- Sorry, Kate.

33
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,461
These fellas said that you've been
expecting them?

34
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,463
- Of course, thanks, Hanks.
- Thanks.

35
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,928
Hey, uh...
you forgot, didn't you?

36
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,556
No, no, I just...

37
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,975
Yeah.

38
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,395
He just wanted to...
Actually, this is him.

39
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,315
I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson.

40
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,108
Kate Lloyd.

41
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,694
Yes.
Do you know who I am?

42
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,655
I do.

43
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,658
Adam told me
a little bit about you as well.

44
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,120
He said you specialized
in vertebrate paleontology.

45
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,747
Primarily, yes.

46
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,042
And obviously you extracted specimens
from pack ice.

47
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,170
I've worked on several cold weather digs.

48
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,172
Good.

49
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,095
An old friend of mine,
a colleague of Oslo,

50
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,057
runs a geological research station
in Antarctica.

51
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,268
48 hours ago, his team found something

52
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,437
quite remarkable.

53
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,272
Really?

54
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,066
What'd they find?

55
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,402
We're flying down there tommorow evening
to examine the site.

56
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,821
And I need a paleontologist.

57
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,742
Doctor, I'm sure you can understand that

58
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,037
I need to know a little bit about what
it is I'm being asked to dig up?

59
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,664
There is a structure.

60
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,457
A structure?

61
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,252
- Yes.
- In Antarctica?

62
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,504
And a specimen.

63
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,006
That's all I can tell you.

64
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,343
And I guess I don't have any time
to think about this.

65
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,471
No, I'm sorry. I need
your answer right now.

66
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,602
Well...

67
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,146
I'm in.

68
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,649
Great.

69
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,027
Adam will get you the details
of our departure.

70
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,658
- Right, I'll see you in the car.
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

71
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,161
Adam.

72
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,249
What the hell is it?

73
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,793
You now officially know as much as I do.

74
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:43,255
But I'll tell you one thing, I
worked for that guy for three years

75
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,133
and I've never seen him this excited.

76
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,297
She US?

77
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,560
Look at this guy.

78
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,315
I mean, how is that even
humanly possible?

79
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,372
I was hoping maybe you could
help me with something?

80
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:03,544
I can't seem to get ahold of a newspaper
three weeks old

81
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,547
and I'm a man in desperate need
for certain information.

82
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,341
Carter, don't do this to
yourself, man.

83
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,969
And what information would that be?

84
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,763
I want to know how the
Cavaliers are going.

85
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,267
I don't follow football.

86
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,978
It's a basketball team.

87
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,021
They play basketball.

88
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,066
Barely.
They're the Cavaliers, man.

89
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,196
- Sorry, I couldn't help you.
- Nah, that's all right.

90
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,867
Listen, just so you guys know,
whatever y'all are doing,

91
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,077
you might wanna wrap it up
in a couple of days.

92
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,537
Yeah, why's that?

93
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,249
There's a storm moving in.
A nasty one.

94
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,419
Good morning, Griggs.
Yeah, he's right.

95
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,921
And the last place
where you want to be

96
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,341
is cooped up with a dozen
Norwegian guys.

97
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,846
Trust me.

98
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,439
Base in sight of my 1 o'clock.

99
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:11,069
<i>This is H3 Sea King inbound to Thule.
Do you copy?</i>

100
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,741
<i>Hello, H3 Sea King.
Please, approach from the west.</i>

101
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,701
<i>Landing pad is cleared</i>

102
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,050
<i>Bravo, coming back.</i>

103
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,387
Good to go, Griggs.

104
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,310
- Dr. Halvorson?
- Yes?

105
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,230
- Welcome to Thule.
- Thank you.

106
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,691
Edvard asked you to go
to the site, right now.

107
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,778
Lars is going to drive you.

108
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,989
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.

109
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,991
<i>- Please go in the Spryte.
- Thanks.</i>

110
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,368
Hello, sir.

111
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,760
Watch your step.

112
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,767
Brighten.

113
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,769
Edvard!

114
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,191
- You got it.
- Sure, I did.

115
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,821
Yeah, this is Kate Lloyd.

116
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,491
- Columbia paleontology.
- Welcome.

117
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,493
Adam Finch,
my research assistant.

118
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,870
- Welcome.
- Hi.

119
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,538
This is Edvard, my good friend.

120
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:30,292
This is some of my team.
Karl and Juliette. Both geologists.

121
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,919
- Hi.
- Welcome.

122
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,421
Okay.

123
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,175
Let me show you why you flew
10,000 miles.

124
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,050
Holy shit!

125
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,972
We estimated this has been here
approximately 100,000 years.

126
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,642
We picked up a signal transmitting.

127
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,479
Some kind of distress call, perhaps.

128
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,773
Incredible.

129
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,817
We think the signal
was triggered

130
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,153
when the survivor
exited the craft.

131
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,284
Survivor?

132
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,602
My God.

133
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,121
How long will it take to get it out,
do you know, Kate?

134
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,919
Assuming you've the right equipment,
I'd say...

135
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,713
maybe half a day.

136
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,216
Good.

137
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,199
The ice, should I ask you how fragile
is it?

138
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,159
It's not in a fracture zone.

139
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,120
So there's very little risk of fissuring.

140
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,956
And the ice is quite dense.

141
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,667
So we think
we can get it out in one piece.

142
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,126
Good.

143
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,296
I mean, rough estimates about
6 by 12 feet, 3 and a half feet high.

144
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,757
- Probably some place right around...
- That's great...

145
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,553
Make sure that everyone stays off
the radio.

146
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,763
I do not want any information out.

147
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,975
And the crane... do we have
something appropriate for this?

148
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,936
Yes, it's already there.
It's all set up.

149
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,396
I'm Peder, by the way.

150
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,356
- Peder.
- Nice to meet you.

151
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,277
So, you've gotten it all taken care of.
I don't think you really need me.

152
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,655
What about him?
He's secretly disinterested or...?

153
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,073
Oh, that's Lars.

154
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,951
He does not understand English,
but he works like a bear.

155
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,536
And, as you can see
from the scans,

156
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,873
the ship carved a 200 meter tunnel
into the ice.

157
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,253
So, let me get this right.
You crashed into a glacier...

158
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,755
And then without enough information

159
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,383
you leave the cozy confines of your ship?

160
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:10,512
Maybe he was hurt and wanted to find
someplace warm.

161
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,850
Well, I guess it didn't find it.

162
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,141
The first night is hard.

163
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,813
- Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you up.
- No, no, it's fine.

164
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,238
I'll never look at them the same again.

165
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,618
What do you mean for transport weight?

166
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:02,499
To cut it down to a portable weight,
we have to take it from here to here.

167
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,378
Start with 4 inches.

168
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,755
I never believed in this shit.

169
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,508
I always did.

170
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,971
- We're all set?
- Nearly there.

171
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,681
Good.

172
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,725
Good.

173
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:26,231
But before we do,
I'm going to take a tissue sample.

174
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,778
Do you really that's a good idea?

175
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,698
Yes, I do.

176
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,993
I mean the conditions
are so unpredictable

177
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,078
and we don't have the proper equipment.

178
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,872
Sterilization is an issue.

179
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,667
Edvard, what do you have in the way of
a small diameter drill?

180
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,003
Up to 30mm.

181
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,255
Very good.

182
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,050
I think somewhere around here.

183
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,390
Kate.
Just a second.

184
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,979
In the future, don't contradict me
in front of those people again.

185
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,815
- I just thought...
- You're not here to think.

186
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,568
You're here to get that thing
safe out of the ice.

187
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,280
I hope we understand each other.

188
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,808
So, have you ever tasted this before?

189
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,019
- No, I haven't.
- It tastes very bad.

190
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,605
Gentlemen.
Ladies.

191
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,442
After a short but thorough investigation

192
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,653
of our visitor,

193
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,531
I can say, unequivocally,

194
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:25,452
that I've never seen anything
on any cellular level,

195
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:31,041
like what we have
in that other room.

196
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,211
<i>Now, the impact of this find...</i>

197
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,422
<i>will be felt
for thousands of years.</i>

198
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,967
<i>From this point on,</i>

199
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:44,388
<i>the world as we know it
has forever been altered.</i>

200
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,978
You, my friends,
will all be immortalized,

201
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,314
as the people
who made this discovery.

202
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,198
Thank you.

203
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,748
Do you think they're going to pay a bonus
for bringing over an alien

204
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,667
instead of coal samples?

205
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:26,096
You've got anything better than
this cough syrup?

206
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,056
- Hey, Griggy.
- Yeah?

207
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,392
You want to go out
and get the cabinet stash?

208
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,060
Sure, no problem.

209
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,396
I'm on it.

210
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,048
Where did I put this bottle?

211
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,652
Jesus Ch...

212
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,410
Screw you, man.

213
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,664
Son of a...

214
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,152
It broke out!

215
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,782
What?

216
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,660
It ain't a damn joke, man!

217
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:37,079
The freaking thing's alive!

218
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,290
I was in the room, man,
looking at the ice

219
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,084
then the freaking thing jumped out!

220
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,736
We search
in groups of two and three.

221
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,365
The entire camp.
If you find it, pull out,

222
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,242
don't attempt anything
on your own.

223
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:16,994
And be careful...

224
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:18,787
we don't know what condition it's in.

225
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:14,259
Griggs, did you leave that open?

226
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:20,432
- I don't remember.
- Shit.

227
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:29,441
Hey, just be careful, man. That thing
jumped through the fucking roof.

228
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:58,887
Jesus Christ.

229
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,627
Help! Over here!

230
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,797
Help! Somebody! Over here!

231
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,011
- It attacked Henrik.
- Come on.

232
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:28,310
- Jesus!
- In there!

233
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,609
- God, somebody do something!
- Oh my God.

234
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:42,908
Shoot it! Shoot the fucker, man!

235
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:07,641
We got to burn that fucker, man! Burn it!

236
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:15,983
Throw it, throw it!

237
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,668
His blood pressure's low.

238
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:26,803
Henrik and...
his small children.

239
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:34,311
Yes, it's horrible.
It's a horrible tragedy.

240
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:39,525
We're all shocked.
At what happened to Henrik.

241
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:44,822
But with due respect, we need to examine
the remains before it all disintegrates.

242
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,950
Hey, that was a man.
Not remains.

243
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,035
No, I know,
I'm talking about the creature.

244
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,414
And I'm sure we're all aware
of the importance of this discovery.

245
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,416
This may be the first
and only time...

246
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,211
mankind has been visited
by an alien lifeform.

247
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:03,674
And as scientists,
we're obliged to study it.

248
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:07,010
Didn't work out so well
the last time, did it?

249
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,929
I think you should destroy it.

250
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,349
Completely.

251
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,186
I think you've contributed
enough to this matter now.

252
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:17,855
Oh, really?

253
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:22,234
Listen, your guy, Olav, back there,
he's in bad shape.

254
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:26,321
Now, we're gonna fly him back
to McMurdo at sun-up...

255
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,073
and take him
to the military hospital.

256
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,201
And what're you gonna tell them, hmm?

257
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:36,999
I'm gonna tell them the truth, as crazy
as it sounds.

258
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,286
Kate?
Can you help here?

259
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,502
Come on.

260
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,466
Pull that side up.

261
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:39,621
His face is encased in some type
of amniotic sac.

262
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:10,402
The tissue. Looks almost new.

263
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,491
What was it doing to him?

264
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:19,077
It appears that it was absorbing him.

265
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,080
Some type of digestion.

266
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,583
It's fascinating.

267
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,837
<i>It is fascinating.</i>

268
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,689
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

269
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,483
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

270
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:52,277
- Do you need something?
- No, no. I'm okay.

271
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,932
What is this?

272
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,894
Looks like a titanium plate.

273
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:29,731
Used to reinforce bones
and compound fractures.

274
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,775
Yeah, that's right.

275
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,361
Henrik broke his arm last year.

276
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:37,447
He had to go to Argentina
to get it set.

277
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:44,663
So if this was in his arm,
what's it doing out of him now?

278
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,919
That's a good question.

279
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:12,566
What are you doing?

280
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,569
Took a sample of Henrik's tissue.

281
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,947
I want to find out what this thing
was doing to him.

282
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,792
I think you should take a look at this.

283
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,722
These cells aren't dead.

284
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,893
That's not possible.

285
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,901
Looks like the alien cells
are somehow

286
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:58,529
attacking Henrik's cells
and then they...

287
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:01,990
What is that? It looks like
they are transforming...

288
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,117
They're imitating his cells.

289
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,289
Okay, I don't know
if that's what I'm seeing, but...

290
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:11,291
They're imitating him.

291
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,028
It's going to be okay, Olav.

292
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:42,197
A doctor will see you in McMurdo.

293
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,285
Kate.

294
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,079
- Hey.
- Hi.

295
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,291
We're leaving.

296
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:56,003
Once the weather holds up,
we'll be back with help...

297
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:58,172
as soon as we can.

298
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,382
Okay.

299
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,010
Alright.

300
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,733
- Keep him warm.
- I will.

301
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,568
C'mon, let's go.

302
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,241
Sit down there.

303
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,286
There you go.

304
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,419
Ah, let's get the hell out of here.

305
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,817
Carter!
Carter, wait!

306
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,664
She's flagging us down.

307
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:41,251
- What's wrong?
- They shouldn't leave.

308
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,755
Carter.

309
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,924
Let's just get out of here, man.

310
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,183
Alright, fuck it, we're landing.

311
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,643
Shit.

312
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,394
Let's take her down.

313
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,982
Is there something wrong?

314
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,277
No, everything's fine.

315
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,994
Probably just forgot something.

316
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,706
We'll be in the air in no time, okay?

317
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,876
Don't worry.

318
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,962
Hang in there.

319
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:46,984
Something's wrong.

320
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:19,183
Hailing McMurdo, or any ears on
the emergency channel.

321
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,602
Do you copy? Over.

322
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:26,023
I repeat, this is Thule Station.

323
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,693
They crashed here,
right behind this ridgeline.

324
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,198
It's impossible to reach them.

325
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:38,410
This doesn't make any sense.

326
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,121
I mean, they have plenty
of visibility, right?

327
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:43,707
We're not going after them?
Shouldn't we try?

328
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:45,959
We need a chopper
to even get close to them.

329
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:47,669
And there's refueling and hailing.

330
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,173
All this can't be a coincidence.

331
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:56,512
Radio's dead. It's fucking dead.

332
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,765
The incoming storm.

333
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,141
Fuck.

334
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,851
There's too much interference.

335
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:34,174
We have four missing persons.
We have no helicopter or radio.

336
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:38,470
You made a mistake
for bringing these people here.

337
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:40,013
More people may die.

338
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,933
But, Sander, we don't know
even if they are dead or not.

339
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:46,270
Colin, Lars, get your gear.

340
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,232
<i>We'll take a snowcat
to the next base.</i>

341
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:51,775
Lars, do it now.

342
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,695
I don't think that's a good idea.

343
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:58,740
And why is that?

344
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:01,201
Because no one can leave this camp...

345
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:03,495
until we know more about
what's going on here.

346
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:06,165
- I make decisions about this camp.
- I know, Edvard, but...

347
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,083
Why did you flag down that helicopter?

348
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:09,918
Because I thought it was in danger.

349
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:11,378
Why?

350
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:14,590
I took a sample of Henrik's blood...

351
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:17,384
and I saw that the alien cells
were still alive.

352
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:21,138
They were alive and they were copying
Henrik's cells.

353
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:23,765
Replicating them.

354
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:26,810
Adam saw it too.

355
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:30,981
Is that true?

356
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:35,235
I don't know.

357
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,654
I mean, I don't know what we saw.

358
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:39,823
I mean, we saw something.

359
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:42,451
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

360
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,750
That this thing can,
and probably has,

361
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,793
replicated a person.

362
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:53,670
- What?
- That can't be.

363
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,422
- Who?
- This is insane.

364
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:58,592
Okay, Okay. Kate? Kate?
Okay! Kate.

365
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,678
This is not the time to be yelling fire.

366
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:05,015
Let's stop, gather our thoughts,

367
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,934
and discuss this in private.

368
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,269
We don't need
any private meeting, Doctor.

369
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:10,812
We all want the fucking information!

370
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,397
There's more.

371
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,276
What are those?

372
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:19,112
I think they are fillings
from someone's teeth.

373
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:21,740
I found them by a puddle of blood
in the shower.

374
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:23,158
Puddle of blood?

375
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:25,786
It can clone cells,
but not inorganic material.

376
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:29,081
It couldn't copy these, so
it spit them out.

377
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:32,167
We're wasting too much time already.
Lars?

378
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,126
Listen!

379
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:37,756
When I went back to check it,
someone had cleaned up the blood.

380
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,092
Someone had wiped it away.

381
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,512
Alright, so whatever it is...

382
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:47,015
It is still here.

383
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,356
I've heard enough.

384
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:57,693
Lars, Colin, get the gear.
Ten minutes.

385
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:00,821
Please, Edvard.

386
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:02,573
You can't leave.

387
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,285
You can't leave!
You don't know what we're dealing with.

388
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,540
Well done.

389
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:23,093
Kate?

390
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,225
I don't know
if I should be speaking about this.

391
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,352
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

392
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:33,520
Speaking about what?

393
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:35,647
You were saying...

394
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:39,860
about someone cleaning up the
blood from the shower.

395
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:42,112
And that someone here
may not be themselves.

396
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:43,238
Juliette, please...

397
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,325
What did you see?

398
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:53,790
After the crash, I think... I saw
Colin coming from the showers.

399
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,584
He was holding something.

400
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,963
It could've been a towel, a rag,
something to clean up.

401
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:05,511
Kate, I can't say for sure, but
it's just that I s...

402
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:23,195
He's leaving with Edvard.

403
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,863
We can't let them go.

404
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:27,032
We can't let any of them go.

405
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,495
I know where they keep
the keys for the vehicles.

406
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:41,880
- Where are they?
- In that drawer.

407
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:44,967
- This one?
- Yes.

408
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:52,349
- How many am I looking for?
- Five.

409
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,686
Three and four.

410
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:58,730
You said there were five?

411
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:37,728
Run!

412
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:49,990
Kate, what happened?

413
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:54,328
Karl. It got Karl.
It got... Karl.

414
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:15,516
Kate.

415
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,113
Burn it!

416
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:35,304
Enough, that's enough.

417
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:39,766
Burn in hell.

418
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,369
What the fuck's happening to us?

419
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,878
It attacks its prey,

420
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:11,465
copies it perfectly...

421
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,176
and then hides inside it.

422
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,637
Waiting.

423
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:21,350
Is it still among us?

424
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,355
It could be any of us.

425
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:34,279
We got to get out of here.

426
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:35,989
Yeah, right now.

427
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:38,742
And it could be getting
a vehicle with it.

428
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:42,079
You'll be alone.

429
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,206
Vulnerable.

430
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,377
That's exactly what it wants.

431
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,631
Not to mention you'll be giving it
a way out of here.

432
00:52:53,298 --> 00:52:55,259
A way to spread.

433
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,929
It's like a virus.

434
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,849
So what do we do with any virus?

435
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:03,851
Quarantine.

436
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:08,856
We isolate it and then we kill it.

437
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:11,441
Yeah.

438
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,570
We have to rely on science.

439
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:18,240
Exposing our uncontaminated blood to the
cells of the creature

440
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,493
might create a reaction...
of some kind.

441
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:24,079
So we take blood samples from everybody.

442
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:26,748
Yeah, and we test each one of them.

443
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,793
Yes, Adam and I can do that.

444
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:32,880
Okay.

445
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:37,176
Lars and I'll disable the vehicles.

446
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:41,430
We have to trust in this plan.

447
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:47,478
It's our only chance
of making it through this.

448
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,787
- Is that it?
- Yes.

449
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,665
- No more vehicles?
- Only these.

450
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,459
Okay.

451
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:21,470
What?

452
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,081
Grenades.

453
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:01,343
Is everything alright?

454
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:09,226
Yes, yes, everything's fine.

455
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:12,729
Good.

456
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:16,817
- Lars, you're okay?
- Yes.

457
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:18,861
Kate, we should go.

458
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:21,280
The storm is getting worse.

459
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,589
Who is that?

460
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,769
Hurry up. They're coming.

461
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,577
The Americans.

462
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:14,917
It is impossible for a human
to survive in that crash.

463
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:20,297
We should burn them.
Right here, right now.

464
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:23,425
- Let's finish them off!
- Peder?

465
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:26,011
It could be murder.

466
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,348
- It could be survival, Kate.
- Yes, but we don't have to kill them.

467
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,850
Right? We can just lock them up...

468
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,269
until the Sander's test is ready.

469
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:36,522
Please.

470
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,650
Please.

471
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,081
So this is a good idea?

472
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,169
Locking us up?

473
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,257
You need our help.

474
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:05,903
Warn your scientists they can't handle
with what we saw in that chopper.

475
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,615
For all I know,
you could be one of those things.

476
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:14,161
It's pretty hard to believe
you both walked away from that crash.

477
00:58:14,495 --> 00:58:17,456
- Yeah, I get that, I do, but...
- We're preparing a test.

478
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:21,335
And then we figure out who's who.

479
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,713
It's all I can offer you right now.

480
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,053
Damn!
There's a fire here!

481
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:34,283
Someone sabotaged it.
There's nothing left. Nothing.

482
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,076
Now there's no test.

483
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:38,495
How could this happen?

484
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:40,622
It was no accident.

485
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,749
You.

486
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,460
You were in there with him.

487
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:47,546
You were the last one.

488
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,090
- How are you accusing me?
- Why not?

489
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:53,302
- He's got something to hide.
- What are you, an asshole?

490
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:55,804
I was the one working on the test.
I left for 2 minutes!

491
00:59:55,888 --> 00:59:57,097
You just don't want us
to know the truth,

492
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:58,473
- do ya?
- Bullshit!

493
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:01,393
This is a goddamn fucking nightmare!

494
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:02,936
There might be another way.

495
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:11,737
I think there might be...
another way to tell.

496
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,005
Peder, give me your flashlight.

497
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:37,638
Now tell Lars...
to open his mouth.

498
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:40,098
Tell him to open his mouth.

499
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,104
Open your mouth.

500
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:55,656
That's good.

501
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:59,284
Lars has fillings.
So he's human.

502
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:01,578
It can't imitate
inorganic material.

503
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:04,289
See?

504
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,167
Yes.

505
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:18,595
Good.

506
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:21,223
Good.

507
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,560
Open.

508
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,645
Come on!

509
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:29,398
You're next!

510
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,275
Open your mouth!

511
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:40,242
Okay.

512
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:43,537
Good.

513
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:49,668
Right now, it's at least something.

514
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,588
A way to eliminate
some of us.

515
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:55,048
So I'm gonna get killed because
I floss?

516
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:57,134
Nobody's getting killed.

517
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:58,802
Kate?

518
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:01,805
Kate, come on.

519
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:03,640
Kate.

520
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:07,019
Just do it.

521
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:08,937
Kate.

522
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,317
Open.

523
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,668
Just go stand over there.

524
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,101
You know as well as I do,
there are too many variables.

525
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:52,105
Open your mouth.

526
01:02:57,736 --> 01:02:58,946
Open your mouth!

527
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:02,199
Theyre porcelain.

528
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:08,372
Go stand with Adam.

529
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:15,003
Anyone else with porcelain fillings?

530
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:17,172
Or clean teeth?

531
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:22,427
It's bloody absurd.

532
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:43,824
This is wrong.

533
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:13,020
Jonas, you and Lars go out.

534
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:15,606
Get Carter and Jameson,
bring them in here, we'll check them too.

535
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:19,151
But why don't we just leave them
where they are? They can't do anything.

536
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:20,277
We need to know.

537
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,696
- What?
- She wants us to find the Americans.

538
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:24,198
Let's do it, then.

539
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:26,909
Come on!

540
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:49,681
She is smart.

541
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:55,729
Yeah.

542
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,107
She is in control now.

543
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:49,158
Shit, they've gone.

544
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:51,702
They escaped.

545
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:53,787
Lars.

546
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:56,790
Let's go back inside.

547
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,836
No.
We have to find them.

548
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,673
Lars, be careful.
They are not human!

549
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:07,384
Lars!

550
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:09,428
Lars!

551
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:11,722
Lars!

552
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:13,056
Lars!

553
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,809
Lars Wait.

554
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:17,269
Lars.

555
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:22,274
Peder.

556
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:25,277
Stay calm!

557
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:30,324
The threat isn't here.

558
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:32,117
It's out there.

559
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:35,078
The Americans are the real enemy.

560
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,956
He's right, Peder.

561
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,626
Whatever they're saying right now,
it doesn't matter.

562
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,795
You can't trust them.

563
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,343
Watch them.

564
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:55,349
Kate!

565
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:57,017
Come on!

566
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:02,439
Come on!

567
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:04,691
Where are they?

568
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:07,611
- Where's the rest?
- They attacked them.

569
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:09,154
- Who?
- They got Lars!

570
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:11,949
- Peder!
- They took Lars!

571
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:13,617
- What happened?
- Peder, keep them back.

572
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,661
- We have to help him.
- Stay on them, Peder.

573
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:17,913
- What happened?
- Peder, they took Lars.

574
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:21,083
- The enemy is out there.
- We don't know if we can trust them!

575
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,377
Peder, don't listen to them.

576
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:25,963
Stay on them! Stay on them, Peder!

577
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,511
They're inside.

578
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:46,483
Where is Lars?

579
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:47,734
We haven't got Lars.

580
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:49,736
- Calm down!
- Where is Lars?

581
01:07:49,903 --> 01:07:51,321
I said calm down!

582
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:53,949
- Where the fuck is Lars?
- Drop it!

583
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:58,745
- Somebody tell him.
- Peder, don't listen to them.

584
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,707
- Put it down!
- They killed Lars!

585
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,711
Lars is killed.
Burn them! Burn them!

586
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:22,019
Peder? Peder?

587
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:27,274
Okay!

588
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:30,110
I just wanna check my friend, okay?

589
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:32,362
It's okay.

590
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:35,115
He was gonna fire.

591
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,796
It's gonna catch fire!
It will explode!

592
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:50,923
Come on! Let's go!

593
01:09:11,902 --> 01:09:12,820
Edvard?

594
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:16,698
Edvard?

595
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,960
- Pick him up.
- Okay.

596
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,090
You.

597
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:35,133
Yeah, you. Help him!

598
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:45,727
Alright, show yourselves!

599
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:48,897
Right fucking now!

600
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:56,905
Everybody in the rec room.

601
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:05,122
Pick him up, come on.

602
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:13,839
Sit down.

603
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:23,056
Not all of us are human.

604
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,602
Just put him over there
on the couch.

605
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:44,828
Help! Help me!

606
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,705
- My God!
- Get it off him!

607
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:50,250
What the fuck is this shit, man?

608
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:02,387
Carter, Carter!

609
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:03,722
Carter, burn it, man!

610
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:07,059
There's something wrong with it!
Hold on!

611
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:09,353
Goddamn it, Carter, burn it!

612
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,151
Look out!
Fuck!

613
01:11:17,152 --> 01:11:18,111
Adam!

614
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:27,329
- Shit!
- Carter, take it!

615
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:30,958
Carter!

616
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,584
There's something wrong
with the pressure.

617
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:34,545
Put some air in the pipe.

618
01:11:37,089 --> 01:11:38,090
Watch out!

619
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:40,968
Carter!

620
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:53,897
We gotta get the air up.

621
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:01,947
No.

622
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:18,046
No.

623
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:19,840
No.

624
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:21,592
God!

625
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:23,802
No, God!

626
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:26,180
Carter!

627
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:29,975
No! No!

628
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:39,711
I'm with you, buddy.

629
01:14:27,259 --> 01:14:28,135
Carter.

630
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:34,850
You're okay?

631
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,102
Yeah.

632
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:41,982
And you?

633
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:44,610
Not yet, no.

634
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:48,155
We find it and then we kill it.

635
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:00,519
I think that was Sander.

636
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:02,896
Yeah.

637
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,961
- Shit!
- Watch out! God!

638
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:30,090
Kate, do you see it?

639
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:31,383
Where'd it go?

640
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:34,219
There!

641
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:36,722
Get back!

642
01:16:47,191 --> 01:16:48,692
Don't.
Don't touch it.

643
01:17:07,544 --> 01:17:08,670
You hear that?

644
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:10,422
Yeah.

645
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:58,942
Kate!

646
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:24,384
- Sander.
- Wait.

647
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:26,136
So what?

648
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:28,889
He'll freeze out there.

649
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,307
And if he doesn't?

650
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,226
If it makes it out of here...

651
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:35,562
millions of people could die.

652
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:38,023
- It's got nowhere to go.
- Yes, it does.

653
01:21:49,827 --> 01:21:52,246
Alright.

654
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:37,082
What?

655
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,172
What happened to Lars?

656
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:46,425
We didn't kill him.

657
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:44,316
Come on.

658
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:14,179
Run, run!

659
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:33,031
Kate!

660
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:35,826
Kate!

661
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:39,413
Kate!

662
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,208
Kate?

663
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:12,047
Kate?

664
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:28,637
Kate!

665
01:31:37,664 --> 01:31:38,916
So what we do now?

666
01:31:44,922 --> 01:31:46,548
There's a Russian station...

667
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:49,092
about 50 miles from here.

668
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:52,930
Should have enough gas.

669
01:32:00,938 --> 01:32:02,856
We're gonna make it back, okay?

670
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,361
Okay.

671
01:32:27,256 --> 01:32:28,382
Let's go.

672
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:32,261
I'm ganna put this in the back.

673
01:32:50,112 --> 01:32:51,864
You know how I knew
you weren't human...

674
01:32:53,824 --> 01:32:55,367
when you showed up back at base?

675
01:32:57,828 --> 01:32:58,787
No.

676
01:33:02,082 --> 01:33:03,333
Your earring.

677
01:33:12,426 --> 01:33:13,927
It was on your other ear.

678
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:26,899
Kate?

679
01:33:27,524 --> 01:33:29,610
Kate, what're you doing?

680
01:33:30,861 --> 01:33:32,154
Let's talk about it.

681
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:34,239
Talk to me.

682
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:35,699
Kate?

683
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:37,075
Kate!

684
01:33:38,494 --> 01:33:39,411
Kate!

685
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:44,124
No!...

686
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:06,683
Oh my God.

687
01:36:14,566 --> 01:36:19,154
Hello?
Hello, can anybody hear me?

688
01:36:20,823 --> 01:36:21,865
Hello?

689
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:25,494
Edvard?

690
01:36:26,537 --> 01:36:27,579
Edvard?

691
01:36:31,959 --> 01:36:33,335
Edvard?

692
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:36,755
Edvard?

693
01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:39,967
Lars, it's me.

694
01:36:48,308 --> 01:36:49,476
Hello, Lars!

695
01:36:58,443 --> 01:37:02,114
Lars? Lars, it's Matias.
It's Matias!

696
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:04,074
- Open your mouth.
- What?

697
01:37:04,408 --> 01:37:11,790
- Do what I say, now!
- It's Matias. Lars, it's me, Matias.

698
01:37:22,718 --> 01:37:27,514
That's no dog.
Start the helicopter, now!

699
01:37:35,147 --> 01:37:38,066
Get it up, get it up! Now!
Come on!
