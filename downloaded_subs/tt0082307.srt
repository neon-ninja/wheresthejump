1
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,320
In this book i collected all

2
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,401
the prophecies of eibon,

3
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,070
handed down from generation to

4
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,334
generation over more then 4,000 years.

5
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,028
You ungodly warlock.

6
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,952
Because of you this hotel and

7
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:59,658
this town will be cursed forever.

8
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:05,506
The seven dreaded gateways are

9
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:08,005
concealed in 7 cursed places.

10
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:11,887
Woe be unto him who ventures

11
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:13,607
near without knowledge.

12
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:20,035
Be careful what you do because

13
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,030
this hotel was built on one of

14
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:24,533
the 7 doors of evil

15
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,206
and only i could save you.

16
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,123
Woe be unto him who opens

17
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,201
one of the 7 gateways to hell,

18
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:56,335
because through that gateway

19
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,714
evil will invade the world.

20
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:29,242
I told you martin, we can't. All i

21
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,205
inherited was the hotel, nothing else.

22
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,083
But it'd be such a pity not to.

23
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,545
Let me at least finish the plans.

24
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,540
No forget it.
I won't even charge you

25
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:39,126
for it. Look, really it's not the case.

26
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:41,214
Ljust wanted to clean up the outside

27
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:43,432
walls a bit, and maybe tidy up inside

28
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,348
a bit and then, well, business

29
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,056
starts booming we'll see.

30
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,024
It's better we do it now because wait

31
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,606
four months or six and believe me,

32
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,812
you are going to lay out.

33
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:51,773
You can't imagine the effect

34
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,944
that double digit inflation is

35
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:54,738
having on housing.

36
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,242
Hi larry. How's it going?

37
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,125
Oh, good morning. I'm gonna have

38
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,670
this whole wall finished by tonight.

39
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,465
Great.
Bye.

40
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,173
Outside is ok. Good old 1800th louisiana,

41
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,177
but the interior.

42
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,463
I mean, hotels just aren't...

43
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:16,906
the eyes!

44
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,208
The eyes!

45
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,006
The eyes!

46
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,381
Eyes!

47
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:35,138
Arthur. Where's that doctor?

48
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:39,316
He's on his way.

49
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:17,837
This man needs to get to a hospital.

50
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:19,091
I'll clean up the wounds first. Have

51
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,639
you got any water?

52
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,849
I'm sorry, but till the plumber comes

53
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,729
back i'm afraid i can't get you any.

54
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,473
Then we'd better move him right now.

55
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:27,849
Give me a hand, will you?

56
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,488
Take the legs... gently...

57
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:32,862
ok, up, right.
Thank you doctor.

58
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:33,902
It's ok.

59
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:35,825
How can i check up on him?

60
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,124
Ask me at the hospital. John mckay.

61
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:45,088
We're off to a great start. Let's just

62
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:47,057
hope there isn't any lasting damage.

63
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:48,972
I sure would like to know how a man

64
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,437
can fall off a scaffolding 6 feet wide.

65
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:57,909
Liza. Hey, look at this picture.

66
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,414
Weird.

67
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:23,030
I wasn't aware that you had

68
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:24,830
already scored a client.

69
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:29,370
Client? There isn't a soul here!

70
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:31,706
I guess it must have been arthur.

71
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:34,088
Yeah.

72
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:11,569
Hey, is anybody home?

73
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,073
Just a minute, i'm coming!

74
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:19,502
Good morning. Are you

75
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:21,383
the plumber? Joe, right?

76
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:24,092
Yes ma'm. What's the trouble?

77
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:26,935
No, thank you. I'm afraid i can't tell you.

78
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,515
Nothing comes out of the faucets,

79
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:29,887
and yet somehow the basement is flooded.

80
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,023
You tell me.

81
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,274
The whole basement?

82
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:34,064
And how!

83
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:35,568
Well, let's take a look.

84
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:38,412
Ok! Follow me, this way.
Off we go.

85
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:45,289
I hope it isn't too serious. Watch out,

86
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:46,629
the stairs are really slippery.

87
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,882
I'm an old sewer rat.

88
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:10,418
Well, here it is. How long do

89
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:13,761
you think it will take?

90
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:16,174
It'll take as long as it takes!

91
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:44,439
Martha?
I made this little pathway

92
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:48,395
to the far end just forjoe.

93
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:53,113
Thank you martha.

94
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:00,713
Well, i'll go take that look.

95
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:04,010
Where is arthur?

96
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:07,721
He is upstairs, tidying up,

97
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,558
we're doing our best to help

98
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,145
yeah, i know. Thank you.

99
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:16,363
Listen, i'll be going into town later.

100
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:18,444
Would you please make

101
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,571
me out a list of all the things

102
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,705
we'll need? Ok,
don't worry.

103
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:48,623
Arthur! What are you doing in my room?

104
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:53,918
I was looking for keys.

105
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,435
Which keys?

106
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:08,530
I told ma i was gonna clean up the

107
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,869
rooms but some of them are locked.

108
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,827
Well, ljust have to find those keys,

109
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:17,914
arthur, won't i? Or else we'll

110
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:21,045
simply call a locksmith.

111
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:22,930
In the meantime, could you go up on

112
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,511
the roof and check the chimney?

113
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,309
I think it is clogged.

114
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,939
I heard a car drive up before.

115
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:40,000
Was it joe?
Yeah. Why??

116
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:33,982
You are liza, aren't you? Yes.

117
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,155
My name is emily.

118
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:38,237
I've been looking foryou.

119
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:44,449
Joe!

120
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,301
Joe!

121
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:57,561
Joe!

122
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:03,856
Arthur?

123
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,954
Arthur?

124
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,670
I don't understand, emily.

125
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:15,711
How do you...

126
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,218
don't worry. I know the way by heart.

127
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,971
And there's always dickey here.

128
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:23,065
Come liza. I'll show you the way.

129
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:12,687
Joe?

130
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:39,291
Emily. Why did you say i must

131
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,372
give up the hotel?

132
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:44,461
I can't explain it to you.

133
00:22:44,555 --> 00:22:47,641
Just take my word for it.

134
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:49,720
Go back to where you came from

135
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:51,606
and hurry.

136
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:32,551
What's the matter?

137
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:35,305
I don't know. He is in amazingly

138
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,553
good condition for a corpse

139
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:38,351
who is supposed to have been
dead for 6 years.

140
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:39,932
Well, the d.a. Said to open him up

141
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:40,639
and see what he had for breakfast.

142
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:41,895
How about we give it

143
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:43,527
a try with...
forget it.

144
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:45,023
You wanna wire this old guy into

145
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:46,064
your brain wave machine?

146
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,151
Why not?
Okay. Okay.

147
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:49,823
But you're on your own with this one.

148
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,831
I warn you though. When i get back,

149
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:56,833
i'm gonna give him an autopsy.

150
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,632
Harris here.

151
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,934
Miller want you up at 24 on the double.

152
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:20,814
I'm on my way honey.

153
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,586
Wait here for me jill. I won't be long.

154
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,793
Mommy! Mommy!

155
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,999
So, what did you do in the big apple?

156
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,798
Just about everything a girl could do

157
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,260
without losing her good english

158
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,337
breeding and reputation,

159
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:30,932
modeling, dancing, secretary.

160
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,520
I almost became an unsuccessful

161
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,601
fashion designer.

162
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:36,644
When this letter arrived

163
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:38,316
announcing the inheritance.

164
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:39,653
Big surprise, uh?

165
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:42,913
More or less. I mean, i knew i had

166
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,375
a rich uncle who was a bachelor

167
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,083
with a lot of real estate

168
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:48,549
imagined for one day to the next

169
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,258
but i neverthat i'd be running a hotel.

170
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:52,300
Tell me, with all those accidents,

171
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,015
you know, joe the plumber

172
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,216
and the house painter.

173
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:56,474
Do you think you'll give up now?

174
00:31:58,608 --> 00:32:00,851
I couldn't do that if i wanted to.

175
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:04,610
This is my last chance.

176
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:09,164
Either i run this hotel or i go on relief.

177
00:32:11,338 --> 00:32:12,334
Well i tell you what,

178
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:14,001
when you get the hotel fixed up,

179
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:14,627
i'll come and stay there

180
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,178
so you can book me a room now.

181
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,473
Sure, you've got it. The best in

182
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:21,725
the house.

183
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,437
Of course. How long do you think

184
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,476
it'll be before it's ready?

185
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,563
I don't know, it's driving on so much.

186
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:30,067
Arthur and martha are more of a

187
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,490
hindrance then a help.

188
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,037
They just can't seem to get it together.

189
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:38,837
Well, if you hired them,

190
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:39,673
you can fire them.

191
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:41,339
But, i can't fire them.

192
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,806
They came with the hotel.

193
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:47,599
Strange, i've never heard of them.

194
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:52,819
Dr. Mckay,

195
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:55,909
dr. Mckay,

196
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:56,952
you're wanted on the phone.

197
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,036
It's the hospital.

198
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,074
Thank you. Excuse me.

199
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,777
Oh... harris, hi.

200
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:16,985
What?

201
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,031
...in heaven

202
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,202
give us this day our daily bread

203
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,416
and forgive us ourtrespasses, as we forgive those

204
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,170
who trespass against us.

205
00:33:30,262 --> 00:33:33,514
Lead us not to temptation, but deliver us from evil.

206
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:34,799
Amen.

207
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,604
...and as we commit the souls of

208
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:39,566
joe and mary ann, to ourfather

209
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:40,816
in heaven we pray together,

210
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:41,854
oh merciful father,

211
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,361
watch overjill, their daughter

212
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:46,861
whom joe and mary ann's untimely departure

213
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:49,995
has left alone in this world, as a helpless child

214
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:53,422
confort her, and guide her, and give her strenght

215
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,003
we ask this, o lord,

216
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:57,473
in the name of the father and of the son,

217
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:59,717
and of the holy ghost. Amen.

218
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,191
Courage, my child

219
00:35:40,856 --> 00:35:41,805
liza!

220
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:44,982
Liza!

221
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:50,199
Liza!

222
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:55,377
Emily?

223
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:00,587
Why didn't you listen to me liza?

224
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:08,143
We blind see things more clearly.

225
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:10,810
I wanted to spare you, but now

226
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:12,946
i'll have to tell you everything.

227
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:49,048
60 years ago everybody in this

228
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,760
hotel disappeared.

229
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,799
Every last person.

230
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:55,730
A painter called schweik,

231
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:58,224
who lived here closeted in his room

232
00:36:58,319 --> 00:36:59,897
had found a key.

233
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,445
What key?
The seven gateways to hell.

234
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,912
This house was constructed

235
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:11,749
on one of the...

236
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:16,595
who else is here?
There's nobody here.

237
00:37:19,813 --> 00:37:20,727
I can feel a presence.

238
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:22,013
Somebody else is in here.

239
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:25,361
No, emily. Nobody is here.

240
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:34,327
Yes, it's him. He is here again.

241
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,086
He has come back to the hotel.

242
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:40,801
Get ahold of yourself,

243
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:46,433
emily, please.
What is this?

244
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:51,236
That? A painting, just an old painting.

245
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:03,546
There's the bell.

246
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:10,475
That's the bell from room 36.

247
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:13,354
That's where he was killed, in his room!

248
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:16,364
36 was schweik's room,

249
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,574
the man who found the key.

250
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:21,499
He has returned, liza.

251
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:22,782
Don't ever enterthat room.

252
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:25,250
Now look emily, i've lived in ny

253
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,011
all my life and if there is one thing

254
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,638
i've learned not to believe in it's ghosts.

255
00:38:29,722 --> 00:38:32,760
I was lucky to inherit this hotel.

256
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,846
The first good break i've had.

257
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,776
It'll take more than a faulty electrical

258
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:39,653
contact or some crazy story to make me

259
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:40,439
give it up.

260
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:07,403
Emily! Emily! Emily!

261
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:07,009
Liza!
John!

262
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:11,186
Hey, hey, calm down, calm down.

263
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:16,358
Take it easy, take it easy, come on.

264
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:06,655
But i saw him. There, nailed to the wall.

265
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:09,746
He...

266
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:13,958
see these nails.

267
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,647
Well, they certainly look old,

268
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:29,192
but this seems more like rust

269
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:29,780
than blood.

270
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:36,079
Now it seems so impossible, so absurd.

271
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:43,256
And yet... i don't know.

272
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:45,888
Now look, come and tell me

273
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:48,185
exactly what you saw, hmm?

274
00:44:48,273 --> 00:44:51,810
No, never mind. It's useless.

275
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:54,862
I guess i must have a pretty wild

276
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:56,660
imagination.
Hmm?

277
00:44:56,746 --> 00:44:58,953
I got carried away with that story

278
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:01,119
that emily told me about room 36.

279
00:45:02,005 --> 00:45:07,133
Emily? Who's emily?
The blind girl

280
00:45:07,222 --> 00:45:08,218
that lives in the old house

281
00:45:08,307 --> 00:45:09,137
by the crossroads.

282
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:13,637
There's no blind girl living there.

283
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:14,563
And i know everyone around here.

284
00:45:21,245 --> 00:45:23,998
The book!
The what?

285
00:45:24,918 --> 00:45:25,949
The book that was on the desk. It's gone!

286
00:45:56,888 --> 00:46:00,009
Open two walls and enterthe basement

287
00:46:00,102 --> 00:46:00,849
and then you'll have a room

288
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:03,512
for a kitchen and maybe for a laundry.

289
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:04,438
Huh?

290
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:06,978
What do you think of that?
Martin,

291
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:08,103
i've already told you.

292
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:09,775
I don't have the money.

293
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,453
Do whateveryou want to as long

294
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:12,914
as it doesn't cost.
I have carte blanche?

295
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:14,577
Carte blanche, but not a blank check.

296
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,460
Okay? Okay. Well, the

297
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:17,547
first thing we do is bring someone

298
00:46:17,548 --> 00:46:18,414
in to pump out all the water.

299
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:20,252
That i can get done real cheap.

300
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,382
And then... oh, and on the other side

301
00:46:23,475 --> 00:46:24,934
i'll make a living room

302
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,348
and a game room. Have you got

303
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:27,719
the original plans of the cellar by any chance?

304
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:56,646
There was another book here.

305
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:58,398
A different one.

306
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:02,706
You wanna buy the book

307
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,202
no, not this one.

308
00:47:04,293 --> 00:47:05,622
The one that was here before,

309
00:47:05,712 --> 00:47:07,705
just a second ago.
That book has

310
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:09,044
been there fortwo years.

311
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:11,461
Nobody wants to buy it. It's very

312
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:15,008
nice though. Very, very interesting.

313
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:23,859
Liza! What's wrong?

314
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:27,618
About the book?
I was just looking

315
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,700
for...
what? Is anything the matter?

316
00:47:29,794 --> 00:47:30,957
You look sick.

317
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:33,883
You're sure
it's nothing?

318
00:47:33,968 --> 00:47:35,131
I'm just a little tired that's all.

319
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,964
I think i'm beginning to see things.

320
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,725
I get the picture. Later i'll have to

321
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:41,187
go to the town hall and dig out

322
00:47:41,272 --> 00:47:42,221
the originals from the files.

323
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:30,223
Re-open that hotel? Uh, huh.

324
00:48:32,983 --> 00:48:34,394
Anyway, all the turn of the century

325
00:48:34,486 --> 00:48:35,020
building plans are on those upper

326
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,904
shelves there.

327
00:48:37,574 --> 00:48:38,570
They should be under what

328
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,698
the cards say, m 13,012.

329
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,783
Well, let's get them down and look at them.

330
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,998
You surprised me mr. Avery.

331
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,672
You haven't heard about ourtown

332
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:52,306
employees latest labor victory?

333
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,219
It tooks three weeks strike to win.

334
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:56,768
Yeah. It was something about lunch.

335
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:58,601
An earlier break.

336
00:48:58,693 --> 00:49:00,069
I'm sure you'll be ok on your own.

337
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:03,192
I'll be out until one or a quarter of.

338
00:49:03,284 --> 00:49:04,660
You feel completely at home now,

339
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:06,869
you hear?
Have a happy lunch.

340
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:08,701
Thank you.

341
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,418
I'm gonna lock the door,

342
00:49:14,011 --> 00:49:15,589
that way you won't be disturbed.

343
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,348
First from one to two,

344
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,389
and now from twelve to one.

345
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:23,859
Three weeks of picketing.

346
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:25,522
A great labor victory!

347
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:28,105
Now, then. M 13,012. manderville.

7 doors hotel. Hotel... 7 doors.

349
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,772
What the...?!

350
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:57,489
"The 7 dreaded gateways to hell

351
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:00,250
are concealed in 7 cursed places."

352
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,218
"And the day the gates of hell are opened,

353
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:22,063
on that day the dead will walk the earth."

354
01:01:54,327 --> 01:02:02,078
Good boy, dicky, good boy.

355
01:02:22,499 --> 01:02:27,876
Who's there? Who's there?

356
01:02:46,915 --> 01:02:50,831
Answer me! I know you're there!

357
01:03:35,538 --> 01:03:40,167
Where are you? Who are you? Who?

358
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:49,058
I know it's you. I can sense it.

359
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,605
What do you want from me now?

360
01:03:54,319 --> 01:04:03,661
What is it now? Schweik, i know you're here.

361
01:04:14,144 --> 01:04:21,527
No, no, schweik!

362
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:25,447
Go away! I don't want to go back!

363
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:27,498
You can't take me.

364
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:30,498
I don't want to go back.

365
01:04:30,589 --> 01:04:32,879
Stop tormenting me! Don't get

366
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:35,840
any closer! Don't get any closer!

367
01:04:35,931 --> 01:04:42,472
No! Go away! Leave me in peace.

368
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:47,279
Don't touch me!

369
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:49,776
You can't take me back!

370
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:53,657
I did what i've been asked,

371
01:04:54,211 --> 01:04:58,923
now leave me alone! Go! Go away!

372
01:05:03,185 --> 01:05:05,309
No! I never spoke. You can't

373
01:05:05,397 --> 01:05:10,821
condemn me! I don't want to go back!

374
01:05:29,688 --> 01:05:31,728
Attack dicky! Attack dicky! Attack!

375
01:05:36,783 --> 01:05:39,026
Dicky! Dicky! Don't let them get

376
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:45,297
near me! Attack! Attack! Chase them

377
01:05:45,297 --> 01:05:53,048
away! Attack! Get rid of them, dicky!

378
01:05:53,144 --> 01:06:00,527
Attack! Dicky! Attack!

379
01:06:24,571 --> 01:06:25,318
Good boy.

380
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:34,327
Good boy. Good boy, dicky.

381
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:35,999
You made them go away.

382
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:26,815
Martha? Arthur? Arthur?

383
01:08:32,911 --> 01:08:36,531
No! No! No!

384
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,107
Stop it! Liza! Liza! Stop it!

385
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:22,532
Liza, come on, it's me.

386
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:27,332
Come on, calm down.

387
01:09:27,419 --> 01:09:28,119
Come sit down,

388
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:29,417
i saw arthur,
come on sit down.

389
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:31,334
He was dead but...

390
01:09:31,802 --> 01:09:34,092
liza, liza, stop it!

391
01:09:36,017 --> 01:09:39,304
I'm sick of hearing all these stories.

392
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:40,679
What stories?? Well, like the first one.

393
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:42,982
There was a man nailed to the wall in room 36.

394
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:44,863
And the blind girl that doesn't exist.

395
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:49,578
Emily's real. She does exist. I saw her.

396
01:09:49,665 --> 01:09:51,872
I spoke to her.

397
01:09:51,961 --> 01:09:53,076
The girl that lives in the old house

398
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:54,452
by the crossroads?
Yes!

399
01:09:54,548 --> 01:09:57,467
That house has been abandoned

400
01:09:57,553 --> 01:09:59,345
forthe last 50 years.

401
01:09:59,431 --> 01:10:03,431
But that's not true. It's not possible.

402
01:10:03,522 --> 01:10:06,311
I was there! I mean i went there.

403
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:08,026
I was there.

404
01:10:08,113 --> 01:10:11,983
Yes, i know you were there. I found

405
01:10:12,078 --> 01:10:14,202
the book you left for me to read.

406
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:19,121
You found the book?
And i read it.

407
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:24,425
What did it say?
Show me where is arthur.

408
01:10:33,948 --> 01:10:39,325
Here? And he tried to kill you? Huh?

409
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:43,331
Please john, you must believe me.

410
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:46,923
I swear.
So where is arthur now?

411
01:10:47,011 --> 01:10:50,596
But i don't know! He attacked me!

412
01:10:50,684 --> 01:10:51,633
I was trying to break free.

413
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:53,804
He was here!

414
01:10:53,898 --> 01:10:59,525
The cuts on my...
there are no!

415
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:09,454
I must be going crazy.
Perhaps, or else...

416
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:16,555
who are you liza? Who are you really?

417
01:11:19,232 --> 01:11:21,522
John, i don't understand you.

418
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,400
What a question. Why do you ask?

419
01:11:24,491 --> 01:11:25,689
Because according to the book of eibon,

420
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:28,786
this hotel is one of the

421
01:11:28,873 --> 01:11:30,866
7 gateways to hell.

422
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:39,113
"And you will face the sea of darkness

423
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,237
and all therein that may be explored."

424
01:13:19,851 --> 01:13:22,937
Strange. There isn't a soul in sight.

425
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:26,061
Yea. Well, we'll be at the hospital

426
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:27,612
pretty soon.

427
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:30,655
I wanna talk to harris.

428
01:14:03,674 --> 01:14:05,502
Where is everybody?

429
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:12,928
Let's try the laboratory.

430
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:30,133
But john...
no, liza, i'm a doctor,

431
01:14:30,219 --> 01:14:31,595
and i won't accept irrational explanations

432
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,717
i want to talk to harris.

433
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:35,973
I'm gonna call the fbi.

434
01:15:11,496 --> 01:15:13,536
John!

435
01:15:54,276 --> 01:15:57,148
The elevator! Get the hell going!

436
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:21,580
Jill?

437
01:17:21,673 --> 01:17:22,669
Jill!

438
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:24,797
Jill!

439
01:17:48,008 --> 01:17:50,001
Harris! What the hell is going on

440
01:17:50,095 --> 01:17:51,044
around here?

441
01:17:51,139 --> 01:17:53,845
I don't know. I think i'm going crazy.

442
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:57,021
Here they come!

443
01:19:14,612 --> 01:19:16,440
It's jill.

444
01:19:16,532 --> 01:19:19,321
She was in the autopsy theater all alone.

445
01:20:23,477 --> 01:20:24,473
This way.

446
01:20:27,651 --> 01:20:30,737
Come on.

447
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:59,738
Come on.

448
01:21:08,344 --> 01:21:09,340
No!

449
01:22:46,425 --> 01:22:51,588
We're underthe hotel.
Impossible!

450
01:22:51,684 --> 01:22:53,345
It's impossible!
It's crazy.

451
01:22:55,649 --> 01:22:59,945
What's happened? Why are we here?

452
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:30,616
Come on.

453
01:25:44,808 --> 01:25:47,300
"And you will face the sea of darkness

454
01:25:47,395 --> 01:25:52,107
and all therein that may be explored."
