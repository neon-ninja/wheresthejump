1
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,762
Cigarette.

2
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,198
Light.

3
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,303
We're almost
at my parents' house, sleepyhead.

4
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,878
l don't believe the dream l just had.

5
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,381
l was in a forest, running barefoot.

6
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,444
l was hurt, and l was being followed
by somebody, and....

7
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,149
Well, the more l ran,
the more l could sense him coming closer.

8
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,282
Who was the guy stalking you?

9
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,691
lt wasn't a guy. lt was me.
That's the weirdest part.

10
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,424
-lt was me running after me.
-Don't you ever have normal dreams?

11
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,522
No.

12
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,835
Being like everyone else is a bore.

13
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,602
We shouldn't have partied so much.
l feel shitty.

14
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,108
Take a rest. l'll wake you when we get there.

15
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,736
-Real funny.
-l'll drive if you like.

16
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,808
-Like last Friday?
-Oh, come on, it was late, and l was tired.

17
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,917
-Tired? More like wasted.
-Well, it was your fault for dumping me...

18
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,888
for three hours
and disappearing with God knows who.

19
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,287
l hope, at least, that he was worth it.

20
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,556
He was unbelievable.

21
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,261
What a slut!

22
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,800
-Asshole!
-Bimbo!

23
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,926
-Bitch!
-Skank!

24
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,526
You're a pig.

25
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,974
Are there any cool places to go out
here in the country?

26
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,511
l'm afraid the town hall
is about the only place.

27
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,479
Wow, if l had to live here all year round,
l think l'd shoot myself.

28
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,745
Well, it's just a different lifestyle.
Besides, remember...

29
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,517
we're here to study, not to party.

30
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,917
-We are not deaf, huh?
-Chill out, Marie.

31
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,204
Come on, Hendrix. Come on. Come on.

32
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,676
l'm gonna get you.

33
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,137
l'll get you, Hendrix.

34
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,952
Tom, stop shouting. Go inside.
You're giving me a headache.

35
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,879
l'm just waiting for Alex to get here.

36
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,151
She'll be here by the time
you take your bath.

37
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,093
No, l can't. Alex hasn't seen the cowboy.

38
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,355
All right, go inside, take your bath,
then put the cowboy suit on again.

39
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,862
Come on, Hendrix.

40
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,199
Come on. Let's go.

41
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,945
Eyes on the road.

42
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,711
You've still got some sarcasm, you know.

43
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,256
Are you sure it's this way?

44
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,022
Of course. Just up ahead.
You turn right at the cornfield.

45
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,993
Oh, look, look. There it is. Turn right.
Now you go straight for about 4 kilometers.

46
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,930
-Wow, easy to get lost.
-Nobody uses this road except for tractors.

47
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,098
Four kilometers of this,
and it's goodbye, car.

48
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,573
You can't act that way
every time a guy tries to talk to you.

49
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,949
-l don't act that way with everyone.
-Come on, Marie, it's always the same story.

50
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,611
And you know it.

51
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,853
-Stop!
-What's wrong?

52
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,058
l think l saw someone.

53
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,422
That's not funny, Alex.

54
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,294
l'm not kidding.
l saw someone in the cornfield.

55
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,733
Stop screwing around like that, will you?

56
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,907
Alex, come back, please.

57
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,038
Alex!

58
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,881
Shit.

59
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,722
Alex.

60
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,119
Alex.

61
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,930
lf this is a joke, l'll make you regret it.

62
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,199
Alex, where are you?

63
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,807
Alex?

64
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,136
Where are you?

65
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,319
l'll get you for this, damn it!

66
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,261
Alex, cut it out.

67
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,162
Alex?

68
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,669
Alex!

69
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,471
Stop, bitch. Come back.

70
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,619
Come back!

71
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,623
Come on, l am sick of your little game.

72
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,689
Damn you. Enough is enough.

73
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,425
-l could have left you out here, you know.
-Yeah, very funny.

74
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,329
-You scared the hell out of me.
-No.

75
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,031
Go on, laugh your head off. Very funny.

76
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,512
Marie, remember,
my family just moved here six months ago.

77
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,916
Their French is worse than mine.

78
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,121
Here we are.

79
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,752
All right.
l see why you passed your exams so easily.

80
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,927
You spend all your time here. There is
not too much else to do except study.

81
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,904
That's right. The only real excitement
around here is when a train runs through.

82
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,605
Take it easy, Hendrix.

83
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,671
Easy, boy.

84
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,177
-Hi.
-Hello, Dad.

85
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,446
How are you?

86
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,118
-Don't worry, he doesn't bite.
-Are you talking about me or the dog?

87
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,055
Marie, this is my pop. Pop, Marie.

88
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,387
Nice to meet you.

89
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,162
So nice to see a person
and not just a photo of you.

90
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,197
-Photo?
-You know, the one l took in Spain.

91
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,392
-lt's on the fireplace.
-You're part of the furniture.

92
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,628
And this is Tom. Hello, cowboy.

93
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,999
-Aren't you happy to see me?
-Of course he's happy.

94
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,172
He insisted on waiting up all night for you.

95
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,511
And your mother has been worrying
the whole day, of course.

96
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,141
Mom always worries for nothing.

97
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,245
-l think she left you something in the oven.
-l told her she didn't have to do that.

98
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,620
Well, she wasn't sure
if you were gonna have time to eat.

99
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,215
Oh, Mother.

100
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,358
l'll put Tom Thumb to bed,
and l'll show Marie her room.

101
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,919
Right. All right, then.

102
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,396
l still have some work to do.
Good night, girls.

103
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,298
-Good night, Pop.
-Good night, sir.

104
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,858
Sweet dreams.

105
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:24,305
-So, what was this place before?
-lt was an old farm that my father renovated.

106
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,539
There're lots of them in the area.
Most of them are in ruins.

107
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,714
lt's too bad.
They've lived here half a year now.

108
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,751
Did they have any problems with neighbors?

109
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,218
You mean the rednecks? Yeah.

110
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,484
They first thought my parents were hippies
here to make goat cheese...

111
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,617
but things are fine now.
Well, here's my room. Yeah?

112
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,355
Okay, follow me.

113
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,924
My parents' room is on the right.

114
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,761
This is Tom's room.
You're upstairs in the guest room, okay?

115
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,667
l'm just going to put him to bed.

116
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,814
Okay, all tucked in.

117
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,089
Nighty-night.

118
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,892
ls that you, Alex?

119
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,365
My mother. l'll meet you upstairs.

120
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,763
-Hi, Mom.
-ls your friend all settled in?

121
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,737
-Show her where the blankets are.
-Okay.

122
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,709
-Clean towels are in the closet.
-Don't worry.

123
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,939
Your very own bathroom, huh?
The heater's electric. Do you want it on?

124
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,545
-No, l can do it if l get cold.
-Well, then...

125
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,179
-what do you think?
-lt's like a doll's house, very pretty.

126
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,330
The problem is, he's got a girlfriend
he doesn't want to split up with.

127
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,461
-Why are you so interested, then?
-Someone who's taken must be worth it.

128
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,797
l'm skeptical of single guys.

129
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,700
-Here. Finished?
-Thanks.

130
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,574
l think it's too easy to be a womanizer
when you're already taken.

131
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,580
Could be right, l guess.

132
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,987
Maybe he doesn't even like me.

133
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,984
-What's his girlfriend like?
-She's Brazilian.

134
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,923
They've been together three months.

135
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,258
A Brazilian?
What, is he into exoticism or something?

136
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,890
Whatever. l need to get a tan, quick.

137
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,599
And l gotta work on my ass.
l tell you, that girl is built.

138
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,797
lf you do salsa, l'll go with you.

139
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,133
Go easy on them, all right?
Or they'll be up all night, chirping.

140
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,576
And you, Marie?

141
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:49,102
-Are you going to finally take the plunge?
-Don't start with that.

142
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,809
-You're gonna end up alone.
-l'm not a slut like you.

143
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,811
-You're so scared.
-Well...

144
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,612
l'm gonna have a smoke outside.
How about you?

145
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,091
l'm beat. l'm going to bed.
Don't be too long.

146
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,187
-l'll wake you at 9:00.
-What's the game plan?

147
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,061
-l was thinking international law to start.
-Okay.

148
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,793
-Good night, Alex.
-Good night.

149
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:12,826
Hey, Alex?
l'm glad that l finally met your family.

150
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,761
Come on, Hendrix. Let's go.

151
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,668
Good night, Hendrix.

152
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,096
l'm coming.

153
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,270
Quiet, Hendrix.

154
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,698
Who is it?

155
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,592
-What's going on, Mommy?
-Nothing much. Now go to sleep.

156
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,657
But what's that noise?

157
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,997
Tom, did you hear what l said?
l told you to go to sleep.

158
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,972
Daniel?

159
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,707
Daniel?

160
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,143
Daniel?

161
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,148
Dan?

162
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,202
Shit, the TV plug!

163
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,862
l can't believe it.

164
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,053
Why me?

165
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,410
Oh, shit!

166
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,905
Alex?

167
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,079
Alex?

168
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,348
Alex?

169
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,051
Alex!

170
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:33,903
Hold on.

171
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,739
lt won't come off.

172
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,814
Wait.

173
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,849
Mommy! Mommy!

174
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,524
Mommy! Mommy!

175
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,499
Mommy!

176
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,500
Mommy! Mommy!

177
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,270
Mommy!

178
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,673
Mommy!

179
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,814
Try to calm down, Alex.

180
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,879
lf he wanted to kill you,
he'd have already have done it.

181
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,151
Now listen to me, Alex. Listen. Listen to me.

182
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,420
Listen to me, for Christ's sake.

183
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,355
Tell me where l can find a telephone.
ln the kitchen?

184
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,457
ln the kitchen?

185
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:10,166
Answer me, Alex. Look, l need your help.
l can't do anything alone. l need you.

186
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,342
l'll be back.

187
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,571
l'll be back, Alex. l swear.

188
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:18,078
He couldn't know
anyone else is in the house. Okay?

189
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,471
l don't believe it.

190
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,076
The phone's been cut.

191
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,811
l'm gonna get you out of here. l promise.

192
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,036
You have to stay quiet, Alex.

193
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,048
You might have a chance to get away.
Come on.

194
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,689
Alex.

195
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,764
Alex, we're gonna get out of this,
l promise you.

196
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,742
Even if we have to fight our way out,
we're gonna make it.

197
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:08,084
Listen, Alex, those other girls were alone,
but there are two of us.

198
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,810
lt's gonna work. lt's got to.

199
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,150
Just a little more.

200
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,920
Alex, l got it open.

201
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,667
We're in a gas station.

202
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,044
This could be our only shot.

203
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,583
The knife.

204
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,515
ln case l don't come back.

205
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,256
-Miss?
-Please call the police.

206
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,526
What?

207
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,738
Miss!

208
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,013
Hey, Jimmy!

209
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:01,386
-How are you?
-Good.

210
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,621
On your own tonight?

211
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:11,732
Yeah, weekends are slow.

212
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,503
So they left you to mind the store.

213
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,506
l guess.

214
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,314
This is the ideal place to bring girls.

215
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,547
Don't tell me it's never happened.

216
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,847
lf l did, my boss would fire me.

217
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:40,996
Come on....

218
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,531
The old rich ladies that drive through....

219
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:51,563
Don't tell me
they never ask for your services.

220
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,977
Ain't that right, Jimmy?

221
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,775
Yeah, l guess.

222
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,214
How do l look?

223
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,991
Do they suit me?

224
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,451
Yeah.

225
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,226
They look good on you.

226
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,563
-They are good protection?
-From what?

227
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,069
From the sun.

228
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,606
Yeah, they're sunglasses.

229
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:26,608
They're good protection.

230
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,645
How much do l owe you?

231
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,853
28.... Are you taking the glasses?

232
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,316
l don't think so. But l need some booze.

233
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,225
Can you give me a bottle of J & B?

234
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,890
Do you have Campbell?

235
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:24,760
l'm not supposed to sell alcohol this late.

236
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,235
-Don't tell the boss, okay?
-l promise.

237
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,079
CLOSED

238
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,382
What were you looking at, Jimmy?

239
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,492
What were you looking at?

240
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:23,316
Fucking come on! Pick up!

241
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,530
-Come on!
-State police.

242
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,396
Please help me!

243
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,662
Calm down. What's happened?

244
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,931
The Sorals, they have a farm.

245
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,064
l'm a friend of their daughter's.

246
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:41,008
Some guy broke in and he killed them all!

247
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,478
He's taken Alex in his truck.
God knows what he'll do.

248
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:47,277
-He axed the gas station guy.
-The gas station guy?

249
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,784
Are you in a gas station? Which one?

250
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,889
Hold on. l'm looking.

251
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,428
l don't know. l was in his truck.
l couldn't see.

252
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,629
lt's an old rusty truck.

253
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:13,301
-Did you get the license plate number?
-No, l was inside! l couldn't see.

254
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,504
You know how many trucks
there are on the road?

255
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:21,073
lt can't be fucking hard to spot
an old truck at this time of day!

256
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,051
Stay calm and simply tell me where you are.

257
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,987
The bastard's getting away.

258
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,718
Send a car or Alex doesn't stand a chance.

259
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,022
l need your location to be able to help you.

260
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:36,187
lf l blow up this fucking place,
will you finally see it, asshole?

261
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,506
Keys....

262
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,542
Keys....

263
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,222
Where are you going, you bastard?

264
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,517
Fuck....

265
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,357
Where did he go?

266
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,082
What do you want from Alex?

267
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,483
She turns you on?

268
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,079
She turns me on, too.

269
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:24,421
She turns me on.

270
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,793
All lights are out. The station looks closed.

271
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,989
We'll take a look anyway.

272
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,004
Fernand, go round the back.

273
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,339
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

274
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,420
Sir, the back door is locked. We need....

275
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,560
Call the DA.

276
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,401
This is Fernand.

277
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:01,738
We got ourselves a homicide.

278
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:10,449
This is Fernand.
We got ourselves a homicide.

279
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,925
Oh, my God!

280
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,676
lt's me, Alex. lt's me.

281
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,855
lt's all over.

282
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,690
There.

283
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:46,141
Don't you touch me!

284
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:48,607
Don't you touch me, l said!

285
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,883
lt's all over. He's dead, Alex.

286
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,011
He's dead. lt's over.

287
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,555
l don't know what you're saying.

288
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,784
-He is dead.
-Just leave me alone!

289
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,689
-lt's over, Alex.
-Get out!

290
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,588
-Alex.
-Get out!

291
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,967
lt's over, Alex. l killed him.

292
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:11,733
Alex.

293
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,135
-Please, come down.
-Don't come near me!

294
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,369
Come on, Alex. Come.

295
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:20,709
lt's all over.
Now he can never do anything to you again.

296
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,844
You bitch, you're crazy.
l'm gonna tear you to shreds!

297
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,617
lt's me. lt's me, Marie, your friend.
l'm on your side.

298
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,887
l killed him, Alex. lt's finished. He's dead.

299
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,162
You murderer, you murdered my family.
God damn it, my family!

300
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:39,792
There was nothing l could do to save them.
There was just you.

301
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:41,858
Alex.

302
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,695
Everything's gonna be okay from now on.

303
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,832
Please, Alex, trust me.

304
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,772
Calm down.

305
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:30,717
You can't escape from me, bitch!

306
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:44,928
l'll take care of you, Alex!

307
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:54,171
l'm gonna take care of you, Alex.

308
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,667
Help! Help me, please.

309
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:22,158
Please!

310
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,732
She's not far. Come on! Come on!

311
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:29,970
What's going on?

312
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,006
Hurry!

313
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:45,779
l'll rip your head off!

314
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:28,586
You'd drive a woman crazy. You little slut.

315
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,827
Do you love me?

316
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:40,156
You don't love me, do you?

317
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,196
You don't love me, do you?

318
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,906
You don't love me, do you?

319
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:58,610
-You don't.
-Yes, l do.

320
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:02,846
Yes, l love you!

321
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:06,883
Yes, l do love you!

322
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,278
Nobody will come between us, ever...

323
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,684
ever again.

324
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,279
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

325
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:11,423
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

326
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,657
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

327
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,856
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

328
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,461
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

329
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,630
I won't Iet anyone come between us....

330
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,309
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

331
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,841
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

332
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:36,014
l won't let anyone
come between us anymore.

333
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,558
She can't see me, right?
