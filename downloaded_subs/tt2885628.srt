00:18:56,202 --> 00:19:00,872
      This is Nina, my...

158
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,173
          Girlfriend.

159
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,374
            Dead...

160
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,743
          Girlfriend.

161
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,812
         This isn't...
           [laughing]

162
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,783
     This isn't happening!

163
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,163
      How could you, Rob?

164
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,600
      Rob, she isn't real.

165
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,503
         She... isn't!

166
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,704
            [laughs]

167
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,374
     NINA: How old is she?

168
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,377
        No, you can't--

169
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,511
          You're dead!

170
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:46,450
      Sure, but I've kept
         my standards.

171
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,888
           I mean...

172
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,757
          supermarket?

173
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,266
      ROB: Holly, just go.

174
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,301
             You...

175
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:06,971
            This...

176
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,707
         This is my...

177
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,876
    Uh, you should just go.

178
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,378
            You can.
   You should just leave me.

179
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,881
 HOLLY: This has to be a dream.

180
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,816
           Oh, fuck!

181
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,651
         Can't be real.

182
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,758
     I can't believe this.

183
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,331
     You're my boyfriend's
      dead ex-girlfriend.

184
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,801
    You think I'm his ex ex?
            I'm not.

185
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,970
      And don't even think
        about calling me

186
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,805
     his late ex-girlfriend

187
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,709
 because that gives completely
     the wrong impression.

188
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,745
         I'm not an ex.

189
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,447
          You're dead!

190
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,016
 Doesn't mean we're on a break
        though, does it?

191
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,486
          Get the fuck
       out of my bedroom.

192
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:12,770
   NINA: You have to help me,
            my love.

193
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,376
 ROB: I can't. I can't. Please.

194
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:23,314
    NINA: I think I remember
     six or seven seconds.

195
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,950
        My mouth filled
       with my own blood.

196
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,451
      And then no change.

197
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,655
             - Rob.
  - Just the mortuary slab...

198
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:35,493
        with you and Dad
  bonding over my naked body.

199
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,996
       I don't want this.

200
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,865
     And then the funeral.

201
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:46,937
      Then you... and her.

202
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,839
       I don't want this.

203
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,742
        Rob, just move.

204
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,750
         Kiss me, Rob.

205
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,360
      Kiss me, beautiful.

206
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:11,962
             [sobs]

207
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,719
          Kissing you
    isn't how it used to be.

208
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,721
              Ow!

209
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:39,423
             Holly!

210
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,058
           Ow, fuck!

211
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,698
          Fuck's sake.

212
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,703
    Wait here for a minute.

213
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,439
             Holly!

214
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,808
          Holly, wait.

215
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,930
             Fuck.

00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:09,814

       [phone vibrating]

219
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,599
  Oh, you'll check your phone

220
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,468
 whilst giving mouth-to-mouth,
           will you?

221
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,704
       Hello? Yeah, uh...
        Ah, we lost him.

222
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,774
  Shame, I know, but I did get
   a text from my boyfriend.

223
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:37,942
           Oh, sorry,
    I don't mean boyfriend.

224
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:40,911
 I mean supermarket fuck buddy.

225
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,514
    Keep pumping the chest.
  You don't want to lose him.

226
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,650
 - The doll, I mean, not the--
       - Fuck off, Josh.

227
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,119

         You all right?
 Look like you've seen a ghost.

229
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,912
      How are things going
  with your sexy suicidal guy?

230
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:19,817
   Has he mentioned her yet,
        dead girlfriend?

231
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,853
       It came up, yeah.

         I'm just going
    to go ahead and say it.

264
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,437
     Have you met someone?

265
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,847
             Sorry.

266
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:12,449
       That sounds so...

267
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,485
         I just mean...

268
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:18,155
       - I mean you can.
          - I haven't.

269
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,130
          But you can.

270
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:31,935
        You should know
    that you can move on...

271
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,137
        if you want to.

272
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39,476
           It's okay.

273
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,383
    We all need to move on.

          did you see?

     First sign of spring.

276
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,071
           ROB: Yeah.

277
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,807
     Spring would be nice.

278
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:18,282

279
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:22,019
      SALLY: Yes, he's in
     the front room. He's--

280
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,121
     I think he's come off
        his bike again.

281
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,889
         DAN: Oh, God,
    is he still doing that?

282
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,992
      - Don't mention it.
      - Of course I won't.

283
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,996
           Hey, Rob.

284
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,998
        Good to see you.

286
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,004
        Yeah. You know.

287
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,206
             Yeah.

288
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,310
              Yep.

289
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,513
 Drink before the performance.
   I've certainly earned it.

290
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,615
    - Have you been writing?
    - Well, I call it that.

291
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:54,284
      Did you get to read
    that chapter I sent you?

292
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,153
 SALLY: That's how Martin Amis
         does it, Rob.

293
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,989
     Gets all his feedback
 from reluctant dinner guests.

294
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,024
  Rob's not reluctant, is he?

295
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,160
     Why does he come here
          every week?

296
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:06,029
 - Well, not to read your book.
 - You don't mind, do you, Rob?

297
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,531
      Well, how's he going
        to answer that?

298
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,900
     DAN: He's a free man.
 He can say whatever he wants.

  When did she do the painting
       in the front room?

300

   It was her A-level piece.

301
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,308
          Very strong.

302
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,143

306
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,297
    SALLY: Have you thought
       any more about...

307
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,633
starting up your studies again?

308
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,004
         I'm not sure.

309
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:50,307
    Feel like my maths brain
         has dried up.

310
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,642
     Seems a bit pointless.

311
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,677
          And working
    in a supermarket isn't--

312
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,414
      You're sounding like
  a nagging grandmother, Sal.

313
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:02,152
   So... how's that motorbike
         of yours, Rob?

314
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:05,489
      Quite a mean machine
       you've got there.

315
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,391
             Yeah.

316
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,593
           It's fine.

317
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,396
  I used to have a Moto Guzzi
          myself once.

318
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,033
      This is ridiculous.

319
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,674
         Fine machine.

320
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,717
            Come on,
    while we have a moment.

321
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,589
        Shall we adjourn
         to the parlor?

322
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,700
           DAN: Here.

            Cheers.

328
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,425
         No. Of course.

329
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,529
       Oh, you don't have
        to read it now.

330
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,769

00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,477
   in the urinal before him.

    Reaching inside himself,

335

      he pissed in the way
         only men can,

336
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,752
        with his hands."

337
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,424
     You know what I mean?
      That just came out!

338

       "With his hands."
           You know.

339
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,067
   I will. I'll... definitely
     read the rest of this.

340
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,636
          This is all
      a new thing for me.

341
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:04,741
     But that-- that's why
    it's so good, you know?

342
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,578
      Scary, but exciting,
           you know?

344
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,748
   It'd be good for you to--

345
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,651
         I mean, uh...

346
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,121
     Not that it has to be
           that PhD.

347
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,524
  You could do anything, Rob.

348
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,528
   Don't let her put you off.

00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:29,166
     Take care, won't you?

350
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,234
   - I'll see you next week.
            - Okay.

353
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,815
     Do you want her to be?

354
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,685
              No.

355
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,789
     I thought you'd gone.

356
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,958
      You stopped texting.

357
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,961
         There you go.

00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,483

373

    I have a shard of glass
   in the back of my throat,

374
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,716
        and that's about
        all I can feel.

375
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,186
    You might as well stop.

376
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:40,590
   - I wanna make you happy.
            - Stop.

    God, Rob, she is young.

379
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:10,720
 Naked, you could pass for 16.

         If I was just
      his old girlfriend,

384
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,997
 then I could see why you'd get
 your frothy little hopes up,

385
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,266
             but..

         by the window,

         into the sand

          in Cornwall.

391
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:40,116
          Or the time
       I went down on him

392
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,185
          on the sofa
   in my parents' front room,

393
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,988
    just before he met them
      for the first time.

             [sobs]

395
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,767
          These things
     will stay in his head

396
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:00,370
  precisely because I am dead.

397
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,374
     You're an oil painting
       that's still wet.

       Any good memories
        you slather out

399
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,846

     by what happens next.

  deal with this... situation,

   but that's just how it is.

405
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:33,169
         No, it isn't.
       We never broke up.

406
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,438
    - You died. I couldn't.
       - Did you want to?

407
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,874
             - No.
         - Well, then.

408
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,312
- I'm breaking up with you now.
          - You can't.

409
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,848
  - What do you mean? Why not?
      - Because I'm dead.

410
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,251
       Didn't change you
       very much, did it?

411
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,286
Well, that's sort of the point.

412
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:52,321
   Why do you always have to
   be like this when we row?

413
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:55,692
  I'm not being like anything.
           I'm dead.

414
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:58,728
  I'm very literally not being
     like anything at all.

415
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,898
    Holly is my girlfriend,
       and you are dead,

416
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,268
      and that means that
 we can't be together anymore.

417
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,871
  You can't expect me to be on
my own for the rest of my life.

418
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:09,939
          You're not.

419
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,015
       This doesn't mean
     I'm gonna forget you.

420
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:28,991
   What the fuck do you think
       you mean by that?

421
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,995
       You're impossible.

      give her a memorial.

427
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:17,460
     I know there's a grave
  but she's not there, is she?

428
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:21,964
  Besides, I want to show her
          how I feel.

429
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,674
  ROB: You know you were right
        about her grave.

430
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:36,579
        She's not there.
  She's not anyplace, is she?

431
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:41,083
   I used to take flowers to
the road where she died, but...

432
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,452
       it's just a field
      with a broken fence.

433
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:48,557
    You know, what matters,
    all that matters is us.

434
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,460
            You, me,

435
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,096
         Sally and Dan,

436
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,332
     what we carry with us.

437
00:48:56,334 --> 00:49:00,636
  Like when I came off my bike
      the first time, I...

438
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,172
   I wanted a lorry to come.

439
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,341
    I wanted to be crushed.

440
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:08,377
       Lose my legs or...

441
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:12,048
        I wanted scars,
   so she'd always be there.

442
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,555
       But you're right.
        This is better.

443
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:24,060
   She drew it on my T-shirt
   one night when we were out

444
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,695
         to wind me up.

445
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:30,566
  She'd decided I'd die first.

446
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,969
      Put a picture of me
     being eaten by sharks.

447
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,503
    Put my name and a date.

448
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,605
  So I said, "What about you?"

449
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:39,675
   She said she'd never die,
    and wrote it underneath.

450
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:44,480
   So was it after her crash
     that you had it done?

451
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,649
       Nope. That night.

452
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,686
  Neither of us felt permanent
  marker was permanent enough.

453
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:54,156
     Her art was all about
        leaving a mark,

454
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,424
   like a needle in a record.

455
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:05,534
     She loved letterpress.

456
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,403
         Old printing.

457
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:16,012
    Seeing the indentation.

458
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:20,583
   The impression stuff made
           always...

459
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:27,423
     Are you sure you wanna
      hear all this shit?

460
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:30,259
        Yeah, of course.

461
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:39,101
           <i> ¶¶ [rock]</i>

462
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:42,238
           [moaning]

463
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:03,325
         Don't know why
       you bought white.

464
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:19,208
      What the hell, Rob?
   You're branding them now?

465
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,310
        It was her idea.

466
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:24,847
   I know what this is about.

467
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:28,317
         You're scared
      you'll be forgotten.

468
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,420
       You don't want me
  to take your place. I won't.

469
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:35,558
         I never will.

470
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:44,600
        You can go now.
       I'm honoring you.

471
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,104
          Jesus wept.

472
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:53,609
You're a very silly little girl,
       aren't you, Holly?

473
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,345
This has nothing to do with me.

474
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,714
           It's him.

475
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,321
   Oblivion would beat this.

476
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:08,657
     Would beat lying next
   to the heat of your heart

477
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:13,429
     beating in your little
         living chest.

478
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:18,901
 The smell of your sweet stink
    rising between your legs

479
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:23,906
    as my boy puts his hand
       inside your pussy.

480
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:26,242
      Nina, don't do this.

481
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:29,278
 I'm just-- I'm trying to help.
           I'm sorry.

482
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,747
        No, you're not.

483
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:35,718
     You didn't even notice
I didn't do anything this time.

484
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,723
     You just rode him like
  a little toy rocking horse.

485
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:43,659
    No. Last time you said--

486
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,529
 I'm not doing this to get off.

487
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:47,863
       I don't want this.

488
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,502
        I don't... want.

489
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:01,644
             Fine.

490
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,681
     Far as I'm concerned,

491
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,217
 the least you could have done
      was leave me a book.

492
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:10,386
           Right now
    that'll be my pleasure.

493
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:13,822
    You know, I'll fuck him
     all day and all night

494
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:16,325
  and leave a fucking library
            for you.

495
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:19,328
    You won't drive me away.

496
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:25,834
    Trust me. I don't intend
        to drive again.

497
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:30,272
   I've had a bad experience.

498
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:34,777
        Rob, are you...
 are you going to say anything?

499
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,881
        What can I say?

500
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:43,519
          I love you.

501
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,521
         [Nina giggles]

502
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,925
  But it's me he can't forget.

503
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,728
       I'm honoring you.

504
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,930
    You won't be forgotten.

505
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:58,767
         Don't you see?
      That is the problem.

506
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:04,607
      And you've certainly
      made that one worse.

507
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:13,983
- Do you want her to come back?
           - ROB: No.

508
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,288
      But I don't know how
       to make her stop.

509
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,259
        [siren blaring]

510
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,836
 Would you meet Nina's parents,
         Sally and Dan?

511
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:36,739
        O-Okay, but I--

512
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:40,609
      - How's that gonna--
    - I think I need you to.

513
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:45,648
     You know, to show them
         I'm moving on.

514
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,550
           With you.

515
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,786
 Perhaps she'll accept it too.

516
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,863
    HOLLY: So what the hell
         was that, Rob?

517
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,732
        SALLY: I'm sorry
        I forgot to ask.

518
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,400
       Is there anything
     you don't eat, Holly?

519
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:40,669
     We're having a roast.

520
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,006
     Um, I'm a vegetarian.

521
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:51,947
         Oh. Um, well,
   there's potatoes and peas.

522
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:58,087
  It's no bother. I'll, um...
        I can do omelet.

523
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,724
         I didn't think
     it would go like that.

524
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:09,865
     Dan's writing a novel.

525
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,867
           Oh, cool.
      Is that what you do?

526
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,602
            - Uh...
       - [loud stirring]

527
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:18,140
         No. It's a...

528
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:19,541
       It's a new thing.

529
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,810
           Our friend
    the maths PhD over there

530
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,513
        helped me set up
        my writing den.

531
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,482
    SALLY: And every Sunday
          poor old Rob

532
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:29,551
 has to come over and give his
opinion on the latest chapters.

533
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,553
         Every Sunday?

534
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,658
        Why don't I know
      about your PhD, Rob?

535
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,094
        Why don't I know
      anything about you?

536
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,796
             What?

537
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,831
 Should I be writing equations
    on the fucking windows?

538
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,573
   HOLLY: Are you all right?

539
00:56:58,149 --> 00:57:01,583
           I'm sorry.

540
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,485
          It's just...

541
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:07,856
          It's just...

542
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:16,732
   HOLLY: What just happened?

543
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,801
     SALLY: You're sitting
        in Nina's chair.

544
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:20,636
          Oh, my God.

545
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:25,741
  What was with the mum, Rob?
         What was that?

546
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:29,011
 - If I can help in any way...
  - No, just leave him to it.

547
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:32,848
      If there's anything
          I can do...

548
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:37,019
   It's just something we all
  have to live with, isn't it?

549
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:39,788
          We just have
       to keep on living.

550
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:43,892
         Don't we, Rob?

551
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,100
           So, Holly,
    what books do you like?

552
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,136
  I don't really-- Textbooks.

553
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:57,840
   But I mean I don't really
      enjoy reading those.

554
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:00,809
     So do you really have
      to go to university

555
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,479
   to be an ambulance driver?

556
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:04,913
           Paramedic.

557
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:09,251
 So first time away from home.

558
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:12,621
 I bet your mother misses you.
     What are you, twenty?

559
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:14,490
     Uh, no, I'm nineteen.

560
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:24,166
   I guess Rob is your first
       proper boyfriend.

561
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:36,845
         They need me.

562
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:41,650
        Fine. Whatever.

563
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,653
             Holly!

564
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,657
     Excuse me, I'm just--

565
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:49,992
           Thank you.

566
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,684
           I'm sorry.

567
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:18,854
             Holly!

568
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,625
   Come on, look, I'm sorry.

569
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:25,961
        Don't ignore me.

570
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,601
      Oh, come on, Holly,
stop being so fucking childish.

571
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:34,002
  What's there to talk about?

572
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,604
         You wanna fuck
   your ex-girlfriend's mum.

573
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,673
        Fuck off, Holly!
  Just 'cause I hold her hand

574
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:40,576
          doesn't mean
      I want to actually--

575
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:43,645
     Can we talk about this
        somewhere else?

576
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:47,082
    - Do you wanna sit here?
       - No, you're fine.

577
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,952
       It just felt like
     I mean nothing to you.

578
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:56,124
           I'm sorry.

579
00:59:56,126 --> 01:00:00,228
    I'm all she's got left.

580
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,131
        And I wanted her
     to meet you because...

581
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:05,867
          I love you.

582
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:10,072
           - Do you?
       - Yes, I love you.

583
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,807
             [ding]

584
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:13,609
           Prove it.

585
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:26,388
       God, you are dark.

586
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,624
     Finally, he realizes!

587
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:29,891
          [Rob laughs]

588
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:40,035
- Oh, Jesus, it's fucking cold!
  - Shh! Someone will hear us.

589
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:42,137
  I really don't fucking care!

590
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,872
          [Rob laughs]

591
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,251
           I'm sorry.
         Oh, fuck yeah.

592
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,961
      Say goodbye to her.

593
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,896
        Don't you think
       that's a bit rude?

594
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:09,264
           - [gasps]
          - What the--

595
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,732
             Fuck!

596
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:12,801
           Ugh! Fuck!

597
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:14,302
         What the fuck
      are you doing here?

598
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:16,104
     Where else would I be?

599
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,906
    I'm not gonna apologize
    if that's what you want.

600
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:19,107
   We make each other happy!

601
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,109
   You don't make happiness.

602
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:23,712
     It blooms on anything
   you don't scrub too hard.

603
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:25,313
          Nina, stop!

604
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:33,355
 You don't think this is love,
         do you, Holly?

605
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,792
          I mean sure,
   he's made you feel useful.

606
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:40,028
  Every drop of semen that has

 has been a splash of sunshine
  on his grief-stricken brow.

608
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:47,035
      But basically you're
      Florence Nightingale

609
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,071
          job-sharing
      with Linda Lovelace.

610
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:52,474
          Jesus, Nina!
  This is fucking ridiculous.

611
01:01:57,114 --> 01:02:00,348
 Nina, come on. Is this really
  how you want to say goodbye?

612
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,085
   No, but neither was going
     through the windscreen

613
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:04,753
     of a Triumph Spitfire,

614
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:07,155
    but sometimes you don't
      get a choice, honey.

615
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:09,224
           Besides...

616
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,359
   you never can say goodbye.

617
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:14,996
             Ever.

618
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:16,765
             What?

619
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:20,102
    What are you doing here?

620
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:23,438
       Don't even mention
      the word "closure."

621
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,809
        Face it, Holly.

622
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:32,347
You've been swaddled and carried
    your whole life through.

623
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,883
  All these fucking lectures?

624
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,885
       You know nothing.

625
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:39,054
        You mean nothing.

626
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:42,157
         To him or me.

627
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,961
         You can't even
   put your own trousers on.

628
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:47,162
     Would you just stop?!

629
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,505
             Nina.

630
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:04,012
     This is the end, Nina.

631
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:11,086
 I'm saying goodbye to you now.

632
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,059
 I'm never gonna see you again.

633
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,795
           Poor Rob.

634
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:27,435
    I'm clearing everything
        out of the flat.

635
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:33,341
    There's not going to be
  a single trace of you left.

636
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:44,019
 I think he's going to ask you
      to move in with him.

637
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:47,355
      Do you think you can
      manage that, Holly?

638
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:50,826
      Living in my house?

639
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:53,028
      Do you really think
       you can eradicate

640
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,964
    every last trace of me?

641
01:03:57,568 --> 01:03:59,034
              Yes.

642
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,873
       I love you, Holly.

643
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:09,311
              Yes.

644
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,301
      [door knob turning]

645
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,304
           After you.

646
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:03,198
 You know you won't be able to
see her parents anymore, right?

647
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,402
 I mean, if this is gonna work.

648
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,938
        Yeah, no, yeah.

649
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,540
           I figured.

01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,979
    HOLLY: What d'you mean?

655
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,514
            For you.

656
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:57,719
     Now that you're here,
     rather than on campus.

657
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:00,188
        Yeah, all right.
           [giggles]

658
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:04,459
    What if I sold the bike?

659

    Rob, you can't do that.

660
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,400
             What?

661
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:15,603
        I don't ride it.
         It's a waste.

662
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:20,342
       I think walking is
    all I'm about ready for.

     Yup. That's where mine
          used to go.

679
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:04,139
         Can't believe
  you threw all my shit away.

680
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:07,375
  The least you could've done
       was gone to Oxfam.

681
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:09,878
        Yup. There too.

682
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:42,243
      Well, this is weird.
Why do you think I'm still here?

683

        Okay, ignore it.

684
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,815
     Good idea, sugar lump.

685
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:49,817
         You can finish
       reading it for me.

        Fuck you, Nina.

687
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:01,596
    You already tried that.

688
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:03,831
       Rob is never gonna
         see you again.

    NINA: You missed a bit.

694
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,443
     ROB: Hiya! Did you see
 the letterpress sold on eBay?

695
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:56,778
    I said we'd deliver it,

696
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,847
    Could be your first trip
        in your new car.

697
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:11,659
     Holly, what the fuck?
     Why is this all white?

     Is that... a new top?

01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:12,487
    SALLY: If I was her,
    I'd want you for myself
    for the whole weekend!

701
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:16,157
     You know what I mean.
        You deserve it.

702
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:20,762
            Thanks.

703
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,969
    I don't just mean, um...

704
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:32,573
     I couldn't get through
          without you.

705
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,510
             Sorry.

706
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:42,650
          I don't mean
       to offload on you.

707
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:45,019
     No, it's-- it's okay.

708
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,559
          I can't even
    walk out on him, can I?

709
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,671
       I mean, I could...

710
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,840
       walk out of here.

711
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,945
 But it's all the other stuff,
           you know.

712
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,017
        How can you take
      30 years of hang-ups

713
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:18,920
    into a new relationship?

714
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:21,689
    Wouldn't stand a chance,
           would it?

715
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,198
    Oh, you won't leave us,
           will you?

716
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,768
     No. No, of course not.

717
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:38,005
    This'll be good though,
           won't it?

718
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:41,008
      Get to see the sea.

719
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,044
     Drop this off to them
        in the morning.

720
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,580
     Make a weekend of it.

721
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:48,783
        Go to the beach.
     We could do anything.

722
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:57,091
      What are you doing?

723
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,860
      I dropped my phone.

724
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:00,728
       Come on. Let's go.

725
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:06,100
      Getting out of here
will do us both a world of good.

     HOLLY: You're driving.

727
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:11,539
        ROB: Yup. Sure.

728
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,639
        All right, mate?

729
01:16:57,347 --> 01:17:00,047
        After all that,
   I bet they don't want it.

           on eBay."

 Don't mess me about, old man.

      I'm a motherfucking
         Power Seller.

733
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:17,832
 So what d'you want to do now?
Fancy that chip shop we passed?

734
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:21,002
            Ah! Oh!
      What are you doing?

735
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:23,170
          - Printing.
          - Ah ha ha!

736
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:25,206
         - Stay still!
             - Uh!

737
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,909
          - Oh, shit.
           - [laughs]

738
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:32,313
  So... what's happening about
      fish and chips then?

01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,715

743
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:17,051
          Scratch me.

744
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:18,285
              Hmm?

745
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:19,520
          Scratch me.

746
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:22,890
         Make me bleed.

747
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:25,259
       I-I don't want to.

748
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:36,437
             Wuss.

749
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:45,146
   Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on.
     You'll break your arm.

750
01:19:45,148 --> 01:19:47,314
     You are such a pussy.

751
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:57,224
             - Oww!
     - Nina! Please! Stop!

752
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:59,894
         Shut up, Rob.
    This is what she wanted.

753
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:05,166
This is what darkness is, Holly.

  Flesh trapped between metal.

755
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:10,070
         Metal on bone.

756
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:13,107
   Almost makes me nostalgic.

757
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:17,044
        Oh, I can almost
       taste the petrol.

758
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:21,415

   the right time to end it.

     I had to speak to you.

909
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,269
       I know I didn't do
    everything I should've,

910
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:39,239
  but I'm a different person.

911
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:41,675
       Believe it or not,
         I'm happy now.

912
01:35:09,337 --> 01:35:10,804
           I'm sorry.

913
01:35:10,806 --> 01:35:12,806
      It wasn't you, Rob.

914
01:35:12,808 --> 01:35:15,141
       It was never you.

915
01:35:32,494 --> 01:35:34,494
     Are you gonna be okay?

916
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:37,464
             Yeah.

 we'll be living from now on ¶

928

         ¶ In clover ¶

929

 ¶ The lovely little sunbeams ¶

930
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:34,614
   ¶ Are dancing everywhere ¶

931
