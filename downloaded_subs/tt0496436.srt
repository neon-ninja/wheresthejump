1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,195
You'll like this. I guarantee it.

2
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,072
Yes!

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,952
Oh, Abe, I love this.

4
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,833
Well, you loved it
when you picked it out.

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,872
- OK, open yours.
- I will.

6
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,277
- Did you know?
- No.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,153
- He didn't tell you?
- No! I swear to God.

8
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,229
Like father, like son.
The two of you are from the same mould.

9
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,596
Happy anniversary.

10
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,910
Happy anniversary.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,314
Are you OK?

12
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,470
- You were tossing and turning all night.
- I know. I don't know what this is.

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,672
Come on. Let's go get some breakfast.

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,717
- Danny, are you hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

15
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,354
Come on. Let's get something to eat.

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,634
Danny, if you're gonna
play with your food,

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,550
at least you've gotta have fun doing it.

18
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,235
There. How's that?

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,757
- Are you OK, buddy?
- I don't feel so good.

20
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,233
Honey, are you all right?

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,914
Come on, let's get out of here.

22
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,319
Can I get some help over here?
Just relax. Sit down.

23
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,158
Here, let me help.

24
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,155
I'm so sorry.

25
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,796
It's the whys that are killing me.

26
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,313
Why were we in that restaurant
on that day at that hour?

27
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,516
Why did that lunatic get it into his head
to kill my wife and my son?

28
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,229
Why not kill me, too?
I mean, he leaves me behind?

29
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,396
Why?

30
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,675
It's just so...

31
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,313
random.

32
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,395
Nice job.

33
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,795
I'm the king.

34
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,874
Here, Dad's gonna catch you.

35
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,833
- You better throw far.
- Don't kill me.

36
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,916
What could go wrong?

37
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,632
Careful.

38
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,636
I see you.

39
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,154
My dad taught me to swim.

40
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,113
Would you consider Dad
tall or short? Very short?

41
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,552
We short people have thick skin cos
it doesn't get stretched over a tall frame.

42
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,750
The reason my wife and son
were murdered...

43
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,598
was because of me.

44
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,992
Because I wasn't able to help them
when they needed me most.

45
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,469
Happy anniversary.

46
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,556
I should've saved them.

47
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,276
I should've saved them.

48
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,356
Slow motion.

49
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,835
Yes!

50
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,190
The winner. The winner!

51
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,234
I know this is upsetting,

52
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,670
but I have to be with my wife and son.

53
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,358
Goodbye.

54
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,989
Christ, Abe, don't do anything
foolish, all right? I'm coming right over.

55
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,788
- Is this our OD?
- Yeah.

56
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,718
- You know how many of these he took?
- I don't know, man.

57
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,673
Get him on an lV.
Start him on normal saline.

58
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,314
Pulse rate 47 and dropping.

59
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,510
- Putting a line in.
- He's crashing.

60
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,473
Give him atropine. Saline wide open.

61
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,989
- Give him the full amp.
- We're losing him.

62
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,076
- Asystole.
- Checking respirations.

63
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,794
Starting CPR. Come on.

64
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,957
- He's dying.
- Come on.

65
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,436
- He's still in V-fib.
- No pulse.

66
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,550
- Did you give him the full amp?
- Yes. He's not responding.

67
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,390
Come back to us. Continue compressions.

68
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,636
No response. Do you wanna call it?

69
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,228
Could be fine V-fib. Give me the paddles.

70
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,116
Charge to 200.

71
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,117
Charged to 200.

72
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,719
Clear.

73
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,995
- 300.
- 300.

74
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,236
Clear.

75
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,390
360. Clear.

76
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,750
- 360.
- 360.

77
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,154
Clear.

78
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,868
- We've got a sinus rhythm.
- Pressure's climbing.

79
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,116
We're getting a response.

80
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,197
It's OK. We brought you back.

81
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,638
Check his oxygen saturation.

82
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,070
Oxygen saturation is good.

83
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,112
Blood pressure is 140 over 60.

84
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,589
Hi. You're awake.

85
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,075
I'm Sherry Clarke.
You're in Saint Elizabeth's lCU.

86
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,829
- Are you my doctor?
- Better. I'm your nurse.

87
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,195
The light hurts my eyes.

88
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,877
- How long have I been here?
- A couple of days.

89
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,757
Dr Karras has been keeping an eye
on you. You're his latest project.

90
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,914
Do you wanna watch some TV?

91
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,868
- Anything in particular?
- No.

92
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,995
Oh, dude, you lucked out.
This is my favourite movie of all time.

93
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,837
We belong dead.

94
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,639
Hello, Abe. I'm Dr Karras.
I'm just gonna have a little look.

95
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,591
- Are you OK?
- I've been better.

96
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,756
Remember why you're here?

97
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,078
You were legally dead, but, lucky for you,
modern medicine knows no limits.

98
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,751
- I died?
- Technically speaking. You had an NDE.

99
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,997
- I don't know what that is.
- Near-death experience.

100
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,875
It's my field of expertise. I fought to make
sure you were my patient. Let me guess.

101
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,438
You saw a white light that engulfed you,
almost seemed to beckon you to stay.

102
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,358
Yeah, that's exact...
How did you know that?

103
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,554
As many as eight out of ten people who've
had an NDE report seeing a white light.

104
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,513
- Freaky, huh?
- What about the light I'm seeing now?

105
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,430
- It's probably an aura, a type of residue.
- So it's normal?

106
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,269
I'd say we're well beyond
the bounds of normal here, but yes.

107
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,350
You'll see 'em less frequently as time
passes and eventually they'll disappear.

108
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,072
She's with us.

109
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,033
She's with us.

110
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,272
She's with us.

111
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,155
So everything looks fine.

112
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,670
No masses, no deviations
in your intracranial space.

113
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,553
But I've seen it three times
in the past few days.

114
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,750
- Seen what?
- The white light.

115
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,829
And there's something else.
You're gonna think I'm crazy, but, um...

116
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,229
I'm seeing and hearing
all kinds of electrical stuff.

117
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,595
EVP stands for
electronic voice phenomena.

118
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,748
Precognition, the light you're seeing,
all that is part of supernatural white noise.

119
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,429
- I've got a grant to study these things.
- So EVP, what exactly is it?

120
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,839
It's the recording of the deceased using
a detuned apparatus like a TV or radio.

121
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,635
Some people believe that EVP
is the afterlife manifest all around us.

122
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,877
Others think it's a charge
or electromagnetic fields,

123
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,596
still others that it's a means through
which the dead can communicate with us.

124
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,110
Frankly, who knows? As long as
we're not exactly sure what it is,

125
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,118
they'll keep funding my grant.

126
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,234
What are you doing down here?

127
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,151
This... is my EVP room.

128
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,714
These have been detuned and I record 'em
to see if I've captured any transmissions.

129
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,628
I suppose that's an important part
of your work, then?

130
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,797
That? Oh.
No, I didn't want to detune that one.

131
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,914
That's Change of Habit.
I'm recording it for research purposes.

132
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,477
I thought I might learn something
from Dr Presley.

133
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,599
- You're not a fan of this one?
- No, it's just...

134
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,837
I just saw one of those things
on the screen.

135
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,276
Transmissions are only visible
after they've been recorded.

136
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,595
On the last close-up of Elvis,

137
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,033
I saw a blast of static with
what looked like an unformed person.

138
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,110
- So what are you doing now?
- I've rewound the feed, I'll detune it.

139
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,152
Let's see if you really saw something.

140
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,557
There. There, that's it. That's it.

141
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,911
That was it. That's what I saw.

142
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,356
- I'll be damned.
- So what does that mean?

143
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,270
Maybe when you had your NDE,
you yourself became a detuned receiver.

144
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,350
You see white-noise transmissions, EVP,
communications with the dead, all that,

145
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,436
without any of this.

146
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,908
You're in uncharted territory.

147
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,113
There's a very good chance you're
going to be seeing some wacky stuff.

148
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,308
I've got to go.
I've got a doctor's appointment.

149
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,319
Sure. Take all the time you need.
Hey, I'm still saving all the clippings

150
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,874
and articles about the shooting and stuff.

151
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,039
I don't want to hear about the day my wife
and son were brutally murdered, OK?

152
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,072
I just can't handle that right now. I...

153
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,675
I refuse.

154
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,310
Hi. Dr Karras asked...

155
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,036
What's wrong?

156
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,594
Dr Karras is dead.

157
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,830
- What?
- He had a heart attack early this morning.

158
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,997
I'm sorry.

159
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,878
- OK, so this...
- EVP.

160
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,470
EVP.

161
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,194
It draws your attention to the white light.

162
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,154
When you see the light, you think
it means... What do you think it means?

163
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,751
That somebody's gonna die. Like with
Dr Karras, it could be a couple of days.

164
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,398
With the woman, it could be hours,
just depending on how strong the light is.

165
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,275
I don't know, but I'm seeing it more and
it's driving me nuts. It's like being God.

166
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,518
- I'm worried about you, Abe.
- Well, how would you explain it, then?

167
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
How about, "l don't know"?

168
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,393
In a city, we probably cross paths with
people who are about to die all the time.

169
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,114
- We just don't know it.
- But what if I do, Marty?

170
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,356
What if I do know
when somebody will die?

171
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,758
- And now you've got this superpower?
- It's not a superpower.

172
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,957
Call it what you want, but that sure as hell
sounds like superhero bullshit to me.

173
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,275
Stop talking all this nonsense.

174
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,713
Come on, you stupid thing.

175
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,036
Get over the track.

176
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,153
- Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
- Come on!

177
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,430
Hey!

178
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,596
You've gotta move!

179
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,477
Come on!

180
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,750
Get out of there!

181
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,309
Move!

182
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,355
Hey!

183
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,157
- Get outta there!
- I can't! My foot's caught! Help me!

184
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,076
Help me!

185
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,509
Get off the track!

186
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,957
Move!

187
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,394
I'm so sorry.

188
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,193
- Yeah?
- How'd you feel about me dropping by?

189
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,471
Abe, uh...
Yeah, sure. When?

190
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,160
How does right freaking now grab you?

191
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,236
Thanks.

192
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,711
What the...?

193
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,956
No way.

194
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,790
Son of a bitch.

195
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,990
Excuse me, sir

196
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,631
- Dammit.
- You should get out.

197
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,231
Beat it, kid. I've dropped a couple
of lug nuts. I think I can handle it.

198
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,870
I don't think that bumper is gonna hold.

199
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,879
Look, I don't need some dipshit kid
telling me what to do, OK?

200
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,438
So you can take your metrosexual ass
back to your yuppie car and...

201
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,078
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

202
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,351
- The bumper was gonna...
- Get away from me.

203
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,438
I owe you my life.

204
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,192
No, Marty, I swear to God, I am fine.

205
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,914
All right. All right, but maybe you should...

206
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,191
I don't know, take a little time off
or something, you know.

207
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,030
- I don't want you overdoing it.
- All right. I'll think about it. Thanks.

208
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,918
You saved somebody's life tonight.

209
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,316
- Would you consider Dad tall?
- No, no, short.

210
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,078
Very short?

211
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,237
- No offence.
- We short people have thick skin

212
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,794
cos it doesn't get stretched
over a tall frame.

213
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,638
Yeah. True.

214
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,710
There's the Austrian coach. Looks like
she's trying to throw him. Ha! Nice job!

215
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,112
Shit!

216
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,634
- Two weeks? That's so far.
- I know.

217
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,320
- I'll have to come.
- Yeah.

218
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,515
Ugh! OK. Three-martini lunches,
here I come.

219
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,032
I'll be right there
to put the easy into listening.

220
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,915
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

221
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,709
- Don't worry. You can make it up to me.
- Just take it easy.

222
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,719
I might even let you pick up overtime
in my hotel room, you know what I mean?

223
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,559
- Hey, come on.
- Just leave it.

224
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,069
All right, that's enough.

225
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,116
- Stop it!
- Get him!

226
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,279
Stop it, you're hurting him!
Stop it, you're hurting him!

227
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,837
Hey! Hey!

228
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,713
- Hey!
- Shit! Guys, guys!

229
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,751
Hey!

230
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,276
- Help! Help!
- Let's go.

231
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,391
I'm slipping!

232
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,909
Please, pull me up.

233
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,349
Pull me up!

234
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,756
Are you OK?

235
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,990
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

236
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,230
Me, I'm not so sure about.

237
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,031
Abe, I missed you at work today.
I guess you decided to take that time off.

238
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,311
Give me a call when you get a chance,
all right? Later.

239
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,352
Playing God for another day.

240
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,918
- Hello?
- Hey, Marty.

241
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,430
I'm on my way to the hospital
to check on that kid I helped earlier.

242
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,120
- Would you meet me there?
- Uh, yeah. Sure.

243
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,390
Great. And...

244
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,559
that stuff you're holding for me,

245
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,910
will you bring it?

246
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,917
I'm ready.

247
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,474
- OK, sure.
- Thanks.

248
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,195
Hey.

249
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,469
Hey.

250
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,071
- Thank you very much for meeting me.
- No problem, man.

251
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,112
There are things in here
that are gonna reopen wounds.

252
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,549
- Are you sure you're ready?
- I'm positive.

253
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,148
- OK.
- Thanks.

254
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,829
- Hey, call me if you need anything.
- I will.

255
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,231
Hey there.

256
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,069
- Oh, hey. Mr Dale.
- I was checking to see how Kurt's doing.

257
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,430
Needed stitches, a few scrapes, bruises,

258
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,678
and we're doing a keep overnight
to make sure there's no concussion...

259
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,519
..but he should be fine.

260
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,911
Thanks.

261
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,437
Oh, come on.

262
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,475
Not a word.

263
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,990
You bitch!

264
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,437
Hey. Hey, are you OK?

265
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,152
Yeah.

266
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,516
Yeah.

267
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,677
I think you just saved my life.

268
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,157
Well, it's beginning to be a fucking habit.
Trust me, it's no big deal.

269
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,796
- Dude, it was my life.
- Well, I didn't mean it like that.

270
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,508
It's you.

271
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,473
Yeah. Yeah, you were my nurse.

272
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,754
It's busted.

273
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,789
I'm so sorry.

274
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,270
That's OK.

275
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,391
- You're hurt. Let me look.
- It's fine.

276
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,476
Hey.

277
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,629
Let me fix you up.
It's the least I can do. Come on.

278
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,712
It's a superficial laceration. Nothing a few
stitches and antibiotics can't take care of.

279
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,789
You are either staring at my ring
or admiring my rack. Which is it?

280
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,390
- The ring. I was...
- I'm just kidding.

281
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,517
It's my old wedding ring.
My husband died a couple of years ago

282
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,916
so I like to keep it close to my heart.

283
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,759
You must have loved him very much.

284
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,074
Yeah.

285
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,597
He was a music teacher
at Sacred Heart Elementary,

286
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,075
and those kids adored him.

287
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,671
He had a unique approach. No doh-ray-mi
crap. He'd organise this recital every year,

288
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,873
have the kids sing Bowie, Pink Floyd,
Rush, The Beach Boys, Jane's Addiction.

289
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,073
- You name it.
- Sounds amazing.

290
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,636
Yeah. It was incredible.

291
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,833
But the end just... It came so quick.

292
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,556
One day we're just living, you know?

293
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,829
Then, boom, he's dead.

294
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,195
That's terrible.

295
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,072
Yeah.

296
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,196
But...

297
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,629
I wake up

298
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,751
and it just hit me.

299
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,395
I had to let Tommy go.

300
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,750
I'll see him again someday. Until then,

301
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,031
you have to accept
what it's supposed to be about.

302
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,632
- Did you two have any kids?
- No.

303
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,309
No. But I still put on the recital
every year in his honour.

304
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,795
The next one's in a couple of days.

305
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,875
- And you should totally come.
- Maybe.

306
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,479
Here.

307
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,680
Take this. Think it over.

308
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,553
Call me if you're interested.

309
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,508
Hey, the cops are here.

310
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,552
Yeah. Tell them their timing sucks.

311
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,198
Is this the present you got Dad
for your anniversary? Can I see it? Can l?

312
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,959
I don't suppose your dad
put you up to this, did he?

313
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,278
No way. Just wondering is all.
I bet it's that watch he wanted, right?

314
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,039
You tell your dad
that he's just gonna have to wait.

315
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,469
Besides, it's just a few days away.

316
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,834
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK, Mom. That man saved our lives.

317
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,633
Thank you!

318
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,479
That's all right.

319
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,630
That's all right.

320
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,278
Henry Caine.

321
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,039
Should not
have saved. Should not have saved.

322
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,278
Should not have saved.
Should not have saved.

323
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,710
Should not...

324
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,355
have saved.

325
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,992
- Julia Caine? My name is Abraham...
- Abraham Dale.

326
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,237
I always knew you'd come.
Please, come on in.

327
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,272
Excuse the mess. We're moving.

328
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,355
I am so sorry for what my husband did
to your wife and son.

329
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,838
Henry was the most down-to-earth, don't-
question-things guy you could ever meet.

330
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,996
So, uh...

331
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,234
so what happened, then?

332
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,874
He, uh...

333
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,355
he had a near-death experience.

334
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,790
He was hit by a drunk driver head-on.

335
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,311
He must have died three times that night.
They finally revived him in the early hours

336
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,796
and then we brought him home
a week later.

337
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,876
That's when it all began -

338
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,869
the strange behaviour,
the weird ideas about life, about death.

339
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,639
He just got so obsessed
with the paranormal.

340
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,993
EVP, the white light,
precognition, all that kind of stuff.

341
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,237
He even thought he could save people.

342
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,756
At first I thought it was understandable.
This man almost died.

343
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,839
But then it just got to be too much.

344
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,951
What do you mean by too much?

345
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,919
I'll show you.

346
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,913
You see? I'll leave you to it.

347
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,879
Oh, shit!

348
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,078
Henry was always blowing fuses in here.

349
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,033
Really? Hm.

350
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,991
Um...

351
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,470
Do you have any idea
what the e stands for?

352
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,715
No.

353
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,197
Would you mind if I took
some of this stuff to look over?

354
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,675
Sure. I don't want any of it.

355
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,999
Look, I am sorry again
for what my husband did.

356
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,918
I can't believe how far gone he is.

357
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,396
- "ls"? What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

358
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,512
- You said "is".
- And?

359
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,030
Don't you mean "was"?
"How far gone he was"?

360
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,116
You don't know?

361
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,115
- Henry's still alive.
- I saw him pull the trigger.

362
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,118
He survived.
He's over at Belmont County.

363
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,196
The asylum.

364
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,238
We keep him up here.
He's been with us a couple of months,

365
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,749
since he slipped out of coma land.

366
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,838
If you ask me,
he ain't never gonna see a courtroom.

367
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,188
Why?

368
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,993
Old Henry...

369
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,634
he sees dead people.

370
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,590
Don't mind me. I'm just gonna stick
around and make sure you boys play nice.

371
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,355
My wife and my son.

372
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,830
Why did you do it?

373
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,793
Why did you kill them?

374
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,117
If save, must kill.

375
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,238
Jesus, you're even crazier
than I thought you'd be.

376
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,316
If save,

377
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,954
responsible.

378
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,674
Responsible for what?

379
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,114
Consequences.

380
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,470
Horrific consequences.

381
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,951
What consequences?

382
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,669
It will never end if you let him in.

383
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,390
You cannot shut the dead out.

384
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,672
The dead will haunt you
until you put right what you've done.

385
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,039
If you save, you must...

386
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,674
you must kill.

387
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,229
Tria Mera.

388
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,318
Tria Mera.

389
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,193
- Trio what?
- Tria Mera!

390
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,796
If save, must kill.

391
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,873
If save, must kill.

392
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,716
If save, must kill. If save, must kill!

393
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,953
It's a three.

394
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,198
What does a three
have to do with the devil's signature?

395
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,269
- Hi, Abe.
- Hi.

396
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,996
So I just finished the rehearsals for
that recital thingy I was telling you about,

397
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,430
so I was basically in the neighbourhood,

398
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,788
and, uh...

399
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,115
Hi.

400
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,835
- I hope you don't mind that I stopped by.
- No, no. I don't...

401
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,916
I don't mind. Um...

402
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,394
But why?

403
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,476
When...

404
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,108
is the last time you drank
a cheap bottle of wine?

405
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,357
That's very kind,
but you really don't have to do that.

406
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,630
I know I don't have to.

407
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,671
I want to.

408
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,631
I'm married.

409
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,034
But thank you.

410
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,672
Abe, I read your file.

411
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,828
I know why you were in the lCU
when we first met.

412
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,430
I know what happened
to Rebecca and Danny.

413
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,198
You saved my life the other night.

414
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,433
I'd love to return the favour.

415
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,516
- I like the hair colour.
- Purple was good, but...

416
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,871
- It goes with the wine.
- Right.

417
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,309
This is great. It really is.

418
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,635
Thank you very much.

419
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,672
- To bad wine and good company.
- Oh, it's bad.

420
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,314
You gotta get out
and do stuff like this, though.

421
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,398
It's the only way you'll make it through.

422
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,832
Danny and Rebecca were my everything.

423
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,635
And Tommy was mine.

424
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,513
But you can't just throw in the towel, Abe.

425
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,669
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

426
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,233
O'Malley's.

427
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,956
I gotta kick your ass in a game of pool
to get back the 2.50 I spent on the wine.

428
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,196
2.50?

429
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,115
You got ripped off.

430
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,435
Eight ball, corner pocket.

431
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,554
OK.

432
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,035
How about double or nothing?

433
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,036
All right.

434
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,834
Rack 'em up, big boy.

435
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,238
- Sorry.
- No, it's OK.

436
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,954
No, l, uh... I shouldn't have done that.

437
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,119
- Not tonight, anyway.
- No, it's OK. It's crazy, but it's OK.

438
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,191
Breaking news.
A tragic accident downtown

439
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,788
has left six people dead
and several injured.

440
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,434
An elderly man driving an orange van...

441
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,113
..crashed into a crowded
bus shelter. So far...

442
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,433
Are you OK, Abe?

443
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,633
Witnesses say the van appeared to
deliberately swerve for the commuters...

444
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,159
Yeah. Um...

445
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,676
Sherry, I gotta go.

446
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,712
- Is it someone you know?
- Yeah.

447
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,796
I'll call you, OK?

448
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,711
If save, must kill.
If save, must kill.

449
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,954
"The third day"?

450
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,550
Authorities found George Sutter in his
kitchen, no attempt to cover up his spree.

451
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,470
The bodies of his wife and children were
found in their beds, butchered so severely

452
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,478
that dental records
will be necessary for an lD.

453
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,955
Sutter has no history of domestic violence

454
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,913
and, when pressed,
could offer no explanation as to...

455
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,999
Beverly Ann Cloy,
a registered nurse for the past 27 years,

456
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,989
smothered 14 of her patients this morning.
She then clocked out and calmly...

457
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:02,352
There's no explanation
why Dickson lost control of the plane...

458
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,395
-..absolutely no reason...
-..offer no explanation...

459
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,954
Always on the third day...

460
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,514
after Caine saved them.

461
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,469
Authorities are confounded
as to why the man drove into the bus stop,

462
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,388
and we are told
that there is no obvious ulterior motive.

463
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,877
"On the third day,
Christ shall rise again. "

464
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,795
But what about the devil?

465
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,277
What about the devil?
What does he do on the third day?

466
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,556
What's the thing with the third day?

467
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,715
"Revelation 13:18."

468
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,990
"Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast."

469
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,318
"Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast:

470
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,912
for it is the number of a man; and his
number is Six hundred and sixty six."

471
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:29,550
"The Bible written in Roman times
for Ancient Greek-speaking audiences."

472
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,953
"All Greek and Ancient Greek..."

473
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,992
"..Ietters have numerical counterparts."

474
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,674
Always on the third day.

475
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,154
But what about the devil?

476
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,670
What about the devil?
What does he do on the third day?

477
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,791
Third day...

478
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,959
after Caine saved them.

479
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,915
"The Bible written in Roman times
for Ancient reek-speaking audiences. "

480
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,795
"All Greek and Ancient Greek letters
have numerical counterparts. "

481
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,152
Tria Mera.

482
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,875
T-t-tria...

483
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,468
M-m-m-m-mer...

484
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,195
"Lucifer - from the Latin
meaning giver of light."

485
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,834
"The archangel
who was thrown out of heaven

486
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,112
for trying to usurp God's power
for his own purposes."

487
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,550
"The one once named Lucifer in heaven

488
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:11,356
is now known as the devil

489
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,438
on Earth."

490
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,993
The third day is the devil's signature.

491
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,440
That kid I saved on the bridge.

492
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,152
Today's the third day.

493
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,309
I brought him into the hospital
the day I helped you. I need to find him.

494
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,556
I really shouldn't be doing this, Abe.

495
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,399
Seems to be par for the course
with us, Sherry.

496
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,476
Yeah.

497
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,591
OK, Kurt Green.

498
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,030
- Sir Alfred Hotel.
- Sir Alfred. Of course. Thank you, Sherry.

499
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,628
- Abe.
- Yeah.

500
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,320
Are we OK?

501
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,873
I hope so.

502
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,517
- Bye.
- Bye.

503
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,631
- Yeah.
- Abe, jeez.

504
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,877
Marty, listen,
I think I understand why Caine did it.

505
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,356
He thought he had to. He did it
because he thought he had no choice.

506
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,392
- Did what?
- I save the man, he takes out a bus stop.

507
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,398
I saved that kid.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

508
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,877
Terrible things happen on the third day
after using the light to save somebody.

509
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,833
- Are you listening to yourself, man?
- No, you listen.

510
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,872
Maybe it's Lucifer
or the devil or these ghosts.

511
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,639
Whatever it is, I know I can stop it, Marty,

512
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,354
before anyone else gets hurt.

513
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,677
You know you're my boy, right?
And I love you. I really do.

514
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:18,158
I'm not gonna stand by and watch you
do this to yourself. I can't. I won't.

515
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:22,398
We've got a business. I can't do this
by myself, man. We've got things to do.

516
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,829
This is the bus stop.

517
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,632
Marty. Marty, l...

518
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,558
Say that again. I can't hear you.

519
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,794
If save, must kill.

520
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,878
Must kill. Must kill. Must kill.

521
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,156
Kurt. Kurt.

522
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,236
Kurt!

523
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,636
I'm terribly sorry.

524
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,758
I sincerely apologise.

525
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,556
I'm sorry. I apologise.

526
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,872
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get down.

527
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,073
He's got a gun!

528
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,191
Let's go!

529
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:16,438
- Just put the gun down.
- Other side. Other side.

530
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,154
- Easy.
- Kurt!

531
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,552
Go, go, go! Now!
I got him. I got him.

532
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,588
- Keep calm. Slowly exit the building.
- This way, please.

533
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,752
Hold on. Kurt!

534
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,394
Kurt, what's wrong? Kurt!

535
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,595
Kurt!

536
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,679
Tria Mera.

537
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,074
I need you to go downstairs
right away. Call 91 1.

538
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,196
Why?

539
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,115
I don't think you should've saved me.

540
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,309
7:30.

541
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,519
Sherry.

542
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,030
Must kill.
If save, must kill.

543
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,711
- If save, must kill. If save, must kill.
- Kill. Kill.

544
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,716
You made it.

545
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,115
- I've been worried sick about you.
- What for?

546
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,435
I heard what happened at the hotel.

547
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,518
First you save that kid's life, and...

548
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,835
You must feel awful, Abe.

549
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,114
Sherry, I need to talk to you.

550
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,556
About what?

551
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,750
- Outside. I'll tell you outside.
- You can tell me right here.

552
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:04,158
- I can't explain in front of all these people.
- Why not?

553
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,715
If save, must kill.

554
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,632
- What is it, Abe?
- Must kill.

555
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,674
- You have to come with me.
- What are you doing? You're hurting me.

556
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,756
- I have to do this.
- Do what?

557
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,838
Sherry, I shouldn't have saved you.

558
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,118
- Calm down.
- You don't...

559
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,470
- Calm down.
- You don't understand.

560
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,273
- Get away from her.
- It doesn't involve you!

561
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,358
Listen to me. Sherry!

562
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,356
Sherry!

563
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,117
Many will die.
Many will die.

564
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,755
Many will die. Many will die.

565
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,592
No, no, no. Not here. Anywhere but here.

566
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:27,028
Here's the menu.
I'll be right back to take your order.

567
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,668
The old man who killed all those people,
you saved him.

568
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,270
And the kid from the hotel,
you saved him too.

569
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,672
And then you saved me.

570
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,554
I'm so sorry, Sherry.

571
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,829
Don't be.

572
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,309
That man, he has a gun.

573
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,079
Police. Put the gun down.

574
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,591
Listen to him, sir.
No one wants to get hurt, right?

575
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,952
Put it down.

576
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,515
Please, just make it stop.

577
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,231
You...

578
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,510
you have to die.

579
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,152
Ma'am.

580
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,555
Please, leave him.

581
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,995
If save, must kill.

582
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,237
Kill. Kill. Kill.

583
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,952
I got her.

584
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,950
Kill. Kill. Kill.

585
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,878
She's going into shock.
Let's get her out of here.

586
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,991
Kill. Kill.

587
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,076
Come on.

588
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,316
Shit!

589
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,712
- I've never seen this before.
- Note the time and sedate.

590
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,115
7:29pm.

591
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,952
- 2ccs Versed.
- Shut her up.

592
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,318
What the hell?

593
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,557
Tria Mera.

594
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,268
Tommy.

595
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,469
Are you all right? Come here.
