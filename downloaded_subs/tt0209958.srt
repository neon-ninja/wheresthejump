1
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,285
Thank you for the horse.

2
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:08,830
You liked him?

3
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,331
Oh, it's beautiful...

4
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,003
but I thought
we were going sailing today.

5
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,801
You promised.

6
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,394
Well, that one's too old.

7
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,028
See, now? That'll do.

8
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,489
Come on!

9
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:45,450
Come on, Mr. E.

10
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,372
- It's broken.
- Who says?

11
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:53,750
Mokelock.

12
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:56,878
Now, Edward, we agreed.

13
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,963
No more Mokelock.

14
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,715
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

15
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,802
Mokelock wants me where I am.

16
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,013
We can fix it.

17
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,021
Edward.

18
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,899
Sing a song of sixpence.

19
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,821
Sing a song of sixpence.

20
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,157
A pocketfull of rye.

21
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,839
Four and twenty blackbirds.

22
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:26,009
Baked in a pie.

23
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,694
Rise and shine.

24
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,958
Mr. E is doing fine.

25
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,008
Did we go sailing?

26
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,763
Almost.

27
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,640
Mokelock showed up.

28
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:16,225
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

29
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,977
Mokelock wants me where I am.

30
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:21,522
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.

31
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:24,901
Where'd he get Mokelock again?

32
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,152
Mother Goose.

33
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:29,822
- Henry.
- Barry.

34
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:32,033
What's the matter, Barry?

35
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,327
Edward's parents are here.

36
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,258
He needs a haircut.

37
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:52,512
He loves it when you visit.

38
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:56,015
My husband
wonders if that's true.

39
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:00,353
He wants to place Edward
in the hospital.

40
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:02,939
I'm sorry, Catherine.

41
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,609
Mr. Baines...

42
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,656
I've been working
on this project for seven years.

43
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,951
I know, Henry. I know.

44
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:20,206
Please don't take offense,
Dr. Kent.

45
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:22,792
Your work's invaluable
to this company.

46
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,669
But you're not sure about me.

47
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:28,673
We've waited eighteen months
for signs of progress.

48
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,800
There has been progress.

49
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:33,177
There's no proof, Catherine.

50
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,929
With all due respect,
Mr. Baines...

51
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:37,765
I'm not the one
who designed the procedure.

52
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:41,436
I mean, I wish I could take
creditfor it, but I can't.

53
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,606
I was chosen to do a job.
They picked me.

54
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,526
But if you think
there's someone better...

55
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,823
or someone who's more devoted
to your son, then--

56
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,742
No one's doubting your ability,
Catherine.

57
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:57,327
What is it, then?

58
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:59,245
There's no proof, Catherine.

59
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:02,665
There's no proof
the procedure works.

60
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:04,625
All you're giving me
is the belief...

61
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,378
that your interaction
with my son...

62
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,921
is not a...

63
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:11,758
hallucination.

64
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,365
Shit!

65
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,515
I better get back to work.

66
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,225
Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.

67
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:29,103
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Baines.

68
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,065
Come, shall we? Lucien.

69
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,866
Lucky she worships you.

70
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,285
Why? Because he hates me?

71
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:46,579
I wouldn't say "hates."

72
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:49,582
Distrusts,
dislikes immensely...

73
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:51,584
can't bear the sight of.

74
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:57,256
What's the verdict?

75
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:59,425
Well, we've got
another six months...

76
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:02,428
and Barry had to push for that.

77
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,475
I want to reverse the feed,
Miriam...

78
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,185
now more than ever.

79
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,146
We've been through this
a hundred times, Catherine.

80
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,815
It's too risky.

81
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,858
Why not?
What do we have to lose?

82
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,653
When I did social work,
it was always better...

83
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:21,155
when we took the kids
out of their environment.

84
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,659
Foster homes
can be scary at first...

85
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:27,453
but eventually they see
that things can be different.

86
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,664
Edward is like that right now.

87
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:35,211
He--he's living in a world
that is not healthy.

88
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,171
Let's show him
a different place.

89
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,674
All right.
Let's say we do it your way.

90
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:43,678
We reverse the feed, and
we bring Edward into your mind.

91
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,805
Can you imagine his shock
when he finds...

92
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:47,849
that he's been thrust
into this whole otherworld?

93
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,853
- I do it all the time.
- You're a willing participant.

94
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:53,855
You're aware
of what's happening.

95
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,773
Edward's in a coma.

96
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,193
And besides, we don't know
what effect it will have on you.

97
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:02,155
I mean,
you're already exhausted.

98
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,157
- Have you been sleeping?
- Yes.

99
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:06,159
- Any more nightmares?
- No.

100
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,205
- No.
- Good.

101
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,790
Leave work here.

102
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,667
Don't take it home in this.

103
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,238
Hey, you.

104
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,826
What are you looking for, hmm?

105
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,411
Want some milk?

106
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,475
That's fun. Let me try it.

107
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:01,065
Not so much power.
The animal is delicate.

108
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,504
Edward, is that you?

109
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:08,716
Edward, were there seagulls
being killed on the beach...

110
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,677
while you were sailing?

111
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:14,389
Don't hide, sweetie, please?
Edward, is that you?

112
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,599
Don't be afraid.

113
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:19,060
No one will hurt you.

114
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:21,187
Edward, is that you?

115
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,527
Go to sleep.

116
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,534
Help!

117
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,871
Somebody, help me, please!

118
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,251
Somebody!

119
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,171
Help me!

120
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,559
Can you hear me?

121
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,936
Help!

122
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:52,779
Thanks for waiting, Cole.

123
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,614
Teddy Lee, no problem.

124
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,741
Special Agent Ramsey.

125
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,201
- Cole.
- Morning.

126
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:02,497
Who found her?

127
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:05,249
The surveyor for the railroad,
about 6:00 this morning.

128
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,003
Skidmarks appear to match
the tire tracks from Reno.

129
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:12,215
And it looks like he scraped
the rail and lost some paint.

130
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,758
It's on its way to the lab
already.

131
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:17,804
Dumped the body overthere.

132
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:35,530
Bleach.

133
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,157
Anne Marie Vicksey.

134
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,659
She makes seven.

135
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:41,452
Jeez, this stinks.

136
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,122
Do they all look like dolls?

137
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,457
Every unfortunate soul.

138
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,210
What's that?

139
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:53,673
Some kind of a collar.
Part of his methodology.

140
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,841
The way he puts it there?

141
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:58,386
He makes it for them.

142
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:00,638
It makes him feel
they belong to him.

143
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,101
Is the water always this low?

144
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:15,695
Yeah, this time of year.

145
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,989
Give me a coroner's report
right away.

146
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,116
Preliminary forensics, too.

147
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:22,618
I don't want anyone
dragging their ass on this.

148
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,300
So, how was work?

149
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:38,593
Oh, exhausting.

150
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:19,592
I have no idea, Jean.
For God's sake.

151
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:23,179
Good luck with the monster.
I love you, too. I gotta go.

152
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,515
- OK. Thanks. Bye.
- All right. Bye-bye.

153
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:30,937
Hot off the presses.

154
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:37,568
There's nothing new to report,
gentlemen.

155
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:40,613
A match on his semen.

156
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,157
Water in her lungs...

157
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,536
show high levels
of chlorine and rust.

158
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:53,710
What, pray tell, is this?

159
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,045
They say they found
some dog hair?

160
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:00,133
From a canine unit?

161
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,759
No. There was no canine unit.

162
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,137
And Anne Vicksey
doesn't own a dog, Teddy.

163
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,640
I want to see this.

164
00:20:12,603 --> 00:20:14,230
What you got, Teddy?

165
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,621
Hypomelanosis.

166
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,125
And that means?

167
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,673
A complete absence of melanin.

168
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:45,011
The dog is an albino.

169
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:50,391
He'd love an animal like that.

170
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:51,976
Gentlemen...

171
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:57,649
I believe an albino dog
is a rare animal indeed.

172
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:56,332
Oh, my God.

173
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:01,713
Oh, my God.

174
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:05,258
You poor boy.

175
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,926
You're gonna be OK.

176
00:22:06,968 --> 00:22:08,803
Baby, I'm so sorry.

177
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:42,545
Jesus Christ, Peter.

178
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,341
Thought you were gonna get
some sleep, clean yourself up.

179
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:48,843
I did.

180
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,472
- They're waiting, you know.
- I'm ready.

181
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,684
Let's go.

182
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,523
We're gonna do this two ways.

183
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:04,984
Breeders of German shepherds.

184
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,487
Ford dealers.

185
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,951
I want you to be thorough,
and I also want you to be fast.

186
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,745
This guy's accelerating.

187
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:18,081
He only waited six days
this time.

188
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:21,042
When he first started,
months could pass.

189
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:24,003
And that means
one of two differentthings.

190
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,465
One, he thinks we're stupid,
and we can't catch him.

191
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:31,302
Two, which is the one
that I believe...

192
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,179
he wants to be caught.

193
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:36,808
The dog hairthing is sloppy.

194
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,269
He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey
in three inches of water.

195
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,271
He knew that we'd find her.

196
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:44,941
Now, there's one thing
I know for certain.

197
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,069
If we can't stop him...

198
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,323
he ain't gonna stop himself.

199
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:10,258
Will this be all right?

200
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,012
Yes, ma'am, that's great.
Thank you very much.

201
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,556
She was still
living at home, ma'am?

202
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,643
We were looking through
apartments.

203
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:22,103
But they're not
moving in together...

204
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:24,605
until after the wedding.

205
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:26,107
Julia wants to be married.

206
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:28,943
Did she ever mention anything
out of the ordinary?

207
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,070
For instance,
somebody she was seeing mad...

208
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:34,115
or somebody perhaps watching her
or following her?

209
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:37,785
Pardon me.

210
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:40,997
Ramsey.

211
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,335
What if you made a mistake?

212
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,462
Maybe this isn't the man.

213
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:49,213
Maybe Julia's safe.

214
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,593
There's certain things
that he does...

215
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:57,889
that make us pretty positive
that this is the man.

216
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,601
Last year,
I lost my husband to cancer.

217
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,354
I went through
such terrible pain.

218
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:07,190
But Julia,
she was always there for me.

219
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:16,407
What's going on, Gordon?

220
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:19,744
Riverside sheriff found
a dog breeder in Woodcrest.

221
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,204
Three years ago,
she had a buyer...

222
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:23,581
for an albino shepherd pup.

223
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,083
Sheriff checks D.M.V.

224
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:28,336
Son of a bitch
drives a '92 ford pickup.

225
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:30,546
- Guess what color.
- Aquamarine.

226
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,267
Ramsey!

227
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,103
- Novak!
- Where is it?

228
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,397
Edison,
just east of Loma Park.

229
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:49,023
S.W.A.T.'s had the house
under surveillance...

230
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,483
for about twenty minutes.

231
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:52,276
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

232
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,320
No registered weapons,
no priors.

233
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,114
Got a license for his dog,
though.

234
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,032
Named him Valentine.

235
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:26,144
You're the bad man,
aren't you, Carl?

236
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:39,449
Mairzy doats and dozy doats

237
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,327
And liddle lamzy divey

238
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:47,123
A kiddley divey, too

239
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:48,833
Wouldn't you?

240
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,854
Brock,
Agent Ramsey, Agent Novak.

241
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:54,774
We got here as fast as we could.
I briefed them on the way over.

242
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,776
Where do we stand?

243
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:58,319
Here's the situation.

244
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,739
We got a high-ground team
on the roof...

245
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,658
afour-man element to the east.

246
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,452
We got an entry team in the van
across from the house...

247
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,538
a two man element to the south.

248
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:09,747
Have you seen him yet?

249
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:13,251
No. There's been some movement
in the kitchen.

250
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:14,961
Can't tell what it is.

251
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:17,380
- You think the girl's in there?
- We'll assume she is.

252
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:41,946
- FBl!
- Go!

253
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,573
Freeze, motherfucker!

254
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,050
I got the dog!

255
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:04,636
- Clear.
- Clear.

256
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:42,173
They'll take him
to County General.

257
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,925
Reid's already there.

258
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,259
Make sure he stays cuffed.

259
00:29:45,301 --> 00:29:47,804
I want two men on him
at all times.

260
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:49,764
I don't want anyone to treat him
but Reid.

261
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:52,225
Not so much as a thermometer
up his ass, understand?

262
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,355
She's not here.

263
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,360
You should come downstairs.

264
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:14,474
Mommy!

265
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:17,977
Please take care
of my little baby!

266
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:41,000
Please, are you there?
Hello?

267
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,671
Please hear me.

268
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:46,339
Can you hear me?

269
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:54,389
I need something.

270
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,849
I need you...

271
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,851
Anybody here?

272
00:32:01,646 --> 00:32:04,649
This is not happening to me.

273
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:08,778
This is definitely
not happening.

274
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,863
Please help!

275
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,755
Have you ever heard
of Whelan's infraction?

276
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,092
It's aform of schizophrenia.

277
00:32:31,134 --> 00:32:33,678
It's very rare,
and it's very severe.

278
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:36,639
In any schizophrenic...

279
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:38,474
these areas would be affected...

280
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:40,977
but in someone with Whelan's...

281
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:42,645
they're hit hard,
and they're hit fast.

282
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:44,897
Can't you load him up
with thorazine or doxepin?

283
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:48,026
Normal psychotropics don't work.

284
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,736
This thing
is caused by a virus...

285
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,989
that infects the neurological
system in utero.

286
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,449
It lays dormant...

287
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,660
until it's triggered
by some kind of trauma.

288
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:59,996
Most likely, he's exhibited
symptomsfor some time...

289
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:02,415
butthe infraction,
orthe breach...

290
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:04,042
didn't occur until today.

291
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,628
The triggers can vary.

292
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:10,590
Uh, usually water-related,
but the results don't vary.

293
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:14,510
He's not just catatonic.

294
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:15,720
He's disappeared--

295
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:19,557
Iike having a dream
and never waking up.

296
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,392
For how long?

297
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,062
Oh, forever.

298
00:33:29,484 --> 00:33:31,944
Lee, I think we might be missing
the bigger picture here.

299
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:34,739
Now, whatever state
that he happens to be in...

300
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,033
there is a girl
that is missing...

301
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:39,619
and her name is Julia Hickson...

302
00:33:39,661 --> 00:33:43,164
and he is the only one
that knows where she is.

303
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:45,959
He keeps them in this thing...

304
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,252
for about forty hours.

305
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:52,090
Now, he took Julia Hickson
at 7:30 last night.

306
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:54,759
Peter, you know me.

307
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:58,012
If there were
anything, anything...

308
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,729
What?

309
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,139
He provides them withfood...

310
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,100
drinking water, and a toilet.

311
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,187
Now, she thinks
she's been kidnapped...

312
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:50,356
that there's a chance
of survival...

313
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:52,692
but it's just a form of torture.

314
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:55,320
This is a kind of ritual
for him--

315
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,655
a cleansing
before he takes them home...

316
00:34:57,697 --> 00:35:01,034
and turns them into a doll,
a toy.

317
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:05,371
Now, this thing
is fully automated...

318
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,583
and unless we find her
by tonight...

319
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:11,586
this will happen to her.

320
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:14,964
At the request
of Mr. Cooperman...

321
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:17,884
we've contacted
your board of directors...

322
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:19,594
and they've given
their approval.

323
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:24,307
And so have Edward's parents.

324
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:26,351
But the decision is yours.

325
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:37,487
It's up to Catherine.

326
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:39,781
She's the one
who would have to face...

327
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:41,616
whatever risks there might be...

328
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:45,078
so, I support
whatever decision she makes.

329
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:48,081
Can I ask you something?

330
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:50,083
Please.

331
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:51,417
If he wasn't like this...

332
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,294
if he was conscious...

333
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:56,881
do you think that he would
tell you where she is?

334
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:01,052
There's always a chance
of a confession. Yeah.

335
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:03,596
And there's things he's done
that show a need for disclosure.

336
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,599
He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.

337
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:11,020
He wants someone to listen,
to try and understand him.

338
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:13,731
Look,
I feel for this girl, I do...

339
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:17,610
but Stargher
may no longer know the truth.

340
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:18,903
For severe schizophrenics...

341
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:21,572
there's no discerning
between fantasy and reality.

342
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,116
Is it possible?

343
00:36:23,157 --> 00:36:26,035
If he came to trust me, yes...

344
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:28,037
but it takes months to earn
that kind of trust.

345
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,290
Is it possible?

346
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:39,090
Daddy?

347
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,427
Come here...

348
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:44,804
and save me! Save me!

349
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:57,442
I'm daddy's girl.

350
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:16,961
His levels are tooflat.

351
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,637
What happened here?

352
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,306
We removed fourteen steel rings.

353
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:35,313
Should have left him
the way he was.

354
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:38,566
He used to suspend himself,
didn't he?

355
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:43,613
They're comforted by
the feeling of weightlessness...

356
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:45,615
Iike floating in water.

357
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:54,123
Now, this, gentlemen,
is the catalyst.

358
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:57,251
The neurological connectic
transfer system...

359
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:59,587
not only maps the mind...

360
00:38:00,797 --> 00:38:02,715
it sends the signal
to another party.

361
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:04,884
All you need to do is tune in...

362
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:08,096
but you do much more
than tune in.

363
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:10,014
You become part of the show.

364
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:16,312
He's ready.

365
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:24,362
Why are there three stations?

366
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:26,572
For a while, we tried
joint therapy sessions--

367
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:28,074
two shrinks
forthe price of one--

368
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,743
but Edward hated it
and only talked to Catherine.

369
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:32,537
She has a gift.

370
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:50,179
Are you sure?

371
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:55,393
I'm sure.

372
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:57,478
OK.

373
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:08,364
Response signal...

374
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:09,532
functioning.

375
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:13,494
We implanted a touch-sensitive
microchip in her hand...

376
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,580
so if she wants
to stop the session...

377
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:18,458
or if it gets too intense,
she can give the signal...

378
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:19,917
and we abort.

379
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:37,226
When we were ready
for practical testing...

380
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,103
Miriam and I auditioned...

381
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:41,439
some of the best child
therapists in the country.

382
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:45,777
And all they did was observe
and report, nothing more.

383
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:48,780
Catherine
was the least experienced...

384
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:51,658
but she came
so highly recommended...

385
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:54,494
that we decided, what the hell,
we'll give her a shot...

386
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:56,579
and immediately,
we could tell she was different.

387
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,901
You're not human.
You don't lie in my house.

388
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,611
You're an animal!

389
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:10,148
Hey, you.

390
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:22,410
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

391
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:26,789
Is your name Carl?

392
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:30,960
You know, I know another
little boy with a horse.

393
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:32,378
His name's Edward.

394
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,756
I mean the boy, not the horse.

395
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:57,737
What's wrong?

396
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:03,344
His victims.

397
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:52,764
Where you come from?

398
00:48:07,654 --> 00:48:09,364
Gentlemen, she's back.

399
00:48:09,405 --> 00:48:10,740
I'll be right there.

400
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:25,755
All right. Come on, Catherine.

401
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:31,928
She's had quite a journey.

402
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,972
Unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

403
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:36,599
- So she's made contact?
- Oh, yes.

404
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:38,977
She's gone very deep
into his world.

405
00:48:39,018 --> 00:48:40,144
Attimes toofar.

406
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:41,938
It's cold.

407
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,107
That can be dangerous.

408
00:48:44,148 --> 00:48:45,400
What are you talking about?

409
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:49,404
Well, if she came to believe
that Stargher's world is real...

410
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:52,824
then theoretically, her mind
could convince her body...

411
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:55,451
that anything
that was done to it there...

412
00:48:55,493 --> 00:48:57,370
is actually done.

413
00:48:57,412 --> 00:49:00,290
It's like the old wives' tale
where you die in your dream...

414
00:49:00,331 --> 00:49:01,874
you die in real life.

415
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:04,961
Henry, could you raise
the temperature in here, please?

416
00:49:05,003 --> 00:49:07,130
- Dr. Kent?
- Just a moment, please.

417
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:09,048
Dr. Kent, can I come in there
and speak with you?

418
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,883
We have to be patient.

419
00:49:10,925 --> 00:49:13,386
I mean, look at her.
She's drowsy.

420
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:14,721
Let her wake up.

421
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:18,224
We don't have a lot of time.
Do you understand that?

422
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:09,442
Our father,
who art in heaven...

423
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:11,486
hallowed be thy name.

424
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,207
Am I interrupting anything?

425
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,634
Is it OK if I...

426
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:49,649
He knows you're here,
doesn't he?

427
00:50:53,277 --> 00:50:56,197
My friend Dr. Reid said...

428
00:50:57,824 --> 00:51:00,076
that it's very unusual--

429
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:01,911
schizophrenia, that is--

430
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:06,082
in a child that's this young.

431
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:08,584
They usually think it's autism.

432
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:09,961
What you have to understand...

433
00:51:10,003 --> 00:51:11,671
is there's nothing wrong
with his body.

434
00:51:12,714 --> 00:51:14,841
What's paralyzed
is a part of his mind.

435
00:51:14,882 --> 00:51:16,968
It's so damaged by the virus...

436
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:19,304
he can't even will himself
to move.

437
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,141
You think you can change that?

438
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:25,476
Do you believe
there's a part of yourself...

439
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,563
that you don't show anybody?

440
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:31,649
I think everybody
has that side of themselves.

441
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:33,735
During a session,
when I'm inside...

442
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:37,071
I getto see those things.

443
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:39,866
I feel them.

444
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:45,496
With Stargher, I felt things
I never want to feel again.

445
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:51,919
He's not even
Carl Stargher anymore.

446
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:55,006
He's this idealized version
of himself--

447
00:51:55,048 --> 00:51:58,301
a king
in a very, very twisted kingdom.

448
00:51:58,343 --> 00:52:01,804
The place for him
to indulge every...

449
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,059
You know, I don't want to talk
about this in here.

450
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,284
I could never do what you do--

451
00:52:23,326 --> 00:52:26,412
devote myself to understanding
a mind like that.

452
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:30,959
I don't think we'll ever be able
to understand a mind like that.

453
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,585
But you try. That's your job.

454
00:52:33,836 --> 00:52:35,004
I guess so.

455
00:52:35,964 --> 00:52:38,216
You don't like what you do?

456
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:40,718
I like it better
than my old job.

457
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,680
Used to be an attorney.
I was a prosecutor.

458
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:45,682
What happened?

459
00:52:47,183 --> 00:52:49,435
I had a case, um...

460
00:52:49,477 --> 00:52:52,230
where this little girl
was molested.

461
00:52:53,356 --> 00:52:56,943
And because of this
one tiny piece of evidence...

462
00:52:56,985 --> 00:52:59,779
that was tainted, he walked.

463
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:03,574
Uh, Charles Gish walked away.

464
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,744
Nothing I could do about it.

465
00:53:08,454 --> 00:53:11,124
The night after
he was released...

466
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,544
Margaret's parents came home--

467
00:53:14,585 --> 00:53:16,504
that was
the little girl's name--

468
00:53:16,546 --> 00:53:17,797
Margaret Sims.

469
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:22,760
And they found Charles Gish
sitting in their living room.

470
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:24,429
He was watching television...

471
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,764
and Margaret
was sitting next to him...

472
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:30,476
and he had cut her open
right down the middle.

473
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:35,773
The parents found
Margaret's heart in the freezer.

474
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:39,777
Charles figured
they'd probably want to keep it.

475
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,948
After that, I left the D.A...

476
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,826
and joined the FBl.

477
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:50,622
Figured I'd just try
to catch 'em.

478
00:53:52,373 --> 00:53:53,875
Till now.

479
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,172
You know,
I started to tell you...

480
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:02,467
that Stargher
really isn't Stargher anymore.

481
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:04,344
Well, that's true, and it's not.

482
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:08,264
The dominant side
is still this horrible thing...

483
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:10,600
but there's
a positive side that--

484
00:54:10,642 --> 00:54:11,768
Positive side?

485
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:14,062
Well, the way he sees himself
as a child.

486
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,397
But isn't that him?

487
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:20,026
The boy Stargher made contact.
He's curious about me.

488
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:21,611
If I could reach the boy...

489
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:24,697
then maybe he'd tell me
about Julia.

490
00:54:29,577 --> 00:54:31,746
What ever happened
to Charles Gish?

491
00:54:32,872 --> 00:54:34,624
Old Charlie
beat the murder rap...

492
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:38,086
because he was insane
when he killed Margaret.

493
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:44,050
His attorney milked the jury
for all they were worth.

494
00:54:44,092 --> 00:54:49,639
Said that a life of sexual abuse
drove him to do these things...

495
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:51,432
and, you know,
what ever the fuck.

496
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:53,142
All that same old bullshit.

497
00:54:54,477 --> 00:54:57,105
Why is that bullshit?

498
00:54:57,146 --> 00:54:58,940
I believe
a child can experience...

499
00:54:58,982 --> 00:55:02,527
a hundred times worse the abuse
than what Gish went through...

500
00:55:02,568 --> 00:55:04,445
and still grow upto be...

501
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:09,075
somebody that would never, ever,
ever hurt another living being.

502
00:55:10,576 --> 00:55:11,786
And you're sure of that?

503
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,206
Yes, I am.

504
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:19,043
I'm sure of that.

505
00:55:22,463 --> 00:55:23,965
Hey, where the hell you been?

506
00:55:25,258 --> 00:55:26,843
I've been right here.

507
00:55:26,884 --> 00:55:29,345
Well, next time tell me, OK?

508
00:55:29,387 --> 00:55:31,639
I didn't want to disturb you.
You looked so cute, you know?

509
00:55:31,681 --> 00:55:33,683
You're all sleeping when you get
that look on you.

510
00:55:36,394 --> 00:55:39,564
Your colleagues want to know
what to do with Stargher.

511
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,073
Tell them to prep him.
I'll be right there.

512
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,370
Thank you, Catherine.

513
00:56:00,043 --> 00:56:03,713
Stargher have any pets?
You know, cats, dogs...

514
00:56:10,428 --> 00:56:13,306
Yeah, you're a good boy,
aren't you, Valentine?

515
00:56:13,348 --> 00:56:15,475
That's supposed to help?

516
00:56:15,516 --> 00:56:17,477
On a subconscious level, yes.

517
00:56:17,518 --> 00:56:21,147
Anything that was special to
Stargher, gave him pleasure...

518
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:23,775
should make him
more accessible...

519
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:25,652
more peaceful.

520
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:26,861
Peaceful?

521
00:56:29,155 --> 00:56:31,032
Nice little pup.

522
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,086
- Mr. Novak.
- Doctor.

523
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:44,295
Thank you.

524
00:56:48,007 --> 00:56:49,676
Round two.

525
00:57:04,065 --> 00:57:06,275
Hey, not funny.

526
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,325
Come on, stop playing around.

527
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:17,245
I'm not. It's a power problem.

528
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:18,997
We're locked out, Catherine.

529
00:57:19,038 --> 00:57:21,666
I--I need you to check
the circuit breaker.

530
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:25,003
I wantyou to check
circuits six through twelve.

531
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:28,631
Come on.

532
00:57:28,673 --> 00:57:29,841
Get up.

533
00:57:31,968 --> 00:57:34,470
Six through twelve.

534
00:58:27,273 --> 00:58:28,399
I'm already in.

535
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:31,778
What did she say?

536
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:47,603
Come here, boy.

537
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,786
Can you take me to Carl?

538
01:00:43,576 --> 01:00:45,036
Need some help?

539
01:00:49,874 --> 01:00:51,542
I've got a present for you.

540
01:00:55,046 --> 01:00:57,382
If you need me...

541
01:00:57,423 --> 01:01:00,635
or if you feel like I'm around
but you can't find me...

542
01:01:00,677 --> 01:01:01,844
just...

543
01:01:03,221 --> 01:01:04,889
Shine it like this.

544
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:10,395
Go ahead, take it.

545
01:01:13,439 --> 01:01:15,566
You like it?

546
01:01:15,608 --> 01:01:17,735
- Carl?
- What's the matter?

547
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:20,238
What?

548
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,531
What's wrong?

549
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:26,536
What happened over here?

550
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:28,246
Just broke all by itself.

551
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:32,875
- Did you break that plate?
- I broke the plate.

552
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:36,462
- Did you break that plate?
- I broke the plate.

553
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:38,047
Well, hey, let's...

554
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:40,216
Let's break 'em all,
how about that?

555
01:01:40,258 --> 01:01:42,051
You little fucking liar!

556
01:01:43,052 --> 01:01:45,388
I should've drowned you
like the runt of the litter.

557
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,098
You don't lie in my house.

558
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,725
This is my house!

559
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:57,108
- He's just a boy.
- Shut up!

560
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,611
You're not his mother!

561
01:01:59,652 --> 01:02:01,779
She's not your mother.

562
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:04,907
She left us, Carl.
Remember that.

563
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:08,036
See that?

564
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:25,011
Wait. Jesus Christ!

565
01:02:25,053 --> 01:02:27,639
What the fuck is this?
Get back--Get over here!

566
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:31,684
Playing with dolls?
You little faggot!

567
01:02:31,726 --> 01:02:33,144
God!

568
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:34,312
What are you,
some kind of a woman?

569
01:02:34,354 --> 01:02:35,813
- Get up!
- But, dad--

570
01:02:35,855 --> 01:02:38,149
Damn it.
You want something to cry about?

571
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:41,694
I'll give you something
to cry about, woman!

572
01:02:41,736 --> 01:02:42,904
Mama's boy!

573
01:02:44,155 --> 01:02:45,323
I didn't raise no faggot!

574
01:02:53,873 --> 01:02:56,042
Stop your crying.

575
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:57,210
You want to iron like a woman?

576
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:59,712
- Let me show you how to iron.
- No!

577
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:05,301
Help me.

578
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:36,582
See?

579
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:39,877
She was my first.

580
01:03:43,298 --> 01:03:45,508
I made such a mess.

581
01:03:46,759 --> 01:03:48,803
Now what I have to do...

582
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:06,404
Why are you here?

583
01:04:08,114 --> 01:04:09,574
Don't lie.

584
01:04:12,452 --> 01:04:15,455
- I came to help you.
- You're lying.

585
01:04:15,496 --> 01:04:17,373
Bitch.

586
01:04:17,415 --> 01:04:18,875
Whore.

587
01:04:21,294 --> 01:04:22,420
Cunt!

588
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:27,342
You sound like your father.

589
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:33,598
He was nothing.

590
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,101
He is nothing.

591
01:04:37,143 --> 01:04:39,604
Who told you to say that?

592
01:04:39,646 --> 01:04:43,316
Do you remember the first time
he talked to you?

593
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:45,902
Were you in water?
Maybe you went swimming.

594
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:51,950
It was my baptism.

595
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:56,454
My father, he...

596
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:58,414
he pushed me under.

597
01:05:02,126 --> 01:05:04,796
I think I had
some kind of seizure.

598
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:08,675
I think I was drowning...

599
01:05:08,716 --> 01:05:11,803
and everybody just looked at me.

600
01:05:15,515 --> 01:05:17,934
Nobody helped me. Nobody.

601
01:05:19,894 --> 01:05:21,479
Except him.

602
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,359
My father...

603
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:28,528
he took me home that night...

604
01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:33,700
and he broke three of my ribs...

605
01:05:33,741 --> 01:05:36,744
and fractured my jaw.

606
01:05:38,871 --> 01:05:41,708
I was six years old.

607
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:48,881
What your father did to you
is evil.

608
01:05:50,717 --> 01:05:53,052
What he did to you was wrong.

609
01:05:54,762 --> 01:05:57,640
He treated you like a thing.

610
01:05:57,682 --> 01:06:00,435
He was more...

611
01:06:03,062 --> 01:06:04,856
powerful than me.

612
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:06,524
No. No one should be
treated like that.

613
01:06:17,744 --> 01:06:18,953
Is that right?

614
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:22,415
In what world do you live in?

615
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,544
Carl, where is Julia Hickson?

616
01:06:26,586 --> 01:06:28,588
No names.

617
01:06:33,926 --> 01:06:35,261
Where is she?

618
01:06:36,804 --> 01:06:39,932
I know you, Carl.
You want to tell me.

619
01:06:39,974 --> 01:06:42,435
Oh, you know me?

620
01:06:46,773 --> 01:06:49,651
Oh, you know who I am?

621
01:06:50,652 --> 01:06:52,528
Where is she?

622
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:56,032
Where's Julia?

623
01:07:13,383 --> 01:07:15,593
That can't be right.

624
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:50,378
Danger pulse.

625
01:07:51,379 --> 01:07:52,880
- No change.
- Christ.

626
01:07:52,922 --> 01:07:54,340
What about emergency cessation?

627
01:07:54,382 --> 01:07:57,093
Gradually terminate the feed,
disable the receptors--

628
01:07:57,135 --> 01:07:58,344
It could lead
to massive shock...

629
01:07:58,386 --> 01:08:00,430
and, Henry, could you please
shut that thing off?

630
01:08:00,513 --> 01:08:01,681
What's going on?

631
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:04,267
That hypothetical situation
I told you about?

632
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,685
- It's happening.
- Can't you stop it?

633
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:06,978
It's not that simple.

634
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,354
Well, you stopped it before--

635
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:10,189
Yes, tha twas different.
That was Edward.

636
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:12,650
With Stargher, his mind
is unfamiliar territory...

637
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:14,819
and she's lost.
She thinks this is real.

638
01:08:14,861 --> 01:08:15,987
Well, is there anything
that we can do?

639
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:19,532
Whatever we do runs the risk
of making things worse for her.

640
01:08:19,574 --> 01:08:21,826
Worse. That's great.

641
01:08:21,868 --> 01:08:23,411
So she's lost somewhere?

642
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:31,002
- No. No.
- No, what?

643
01:08:31,044 --> 01:08:32,337
I need you here.

644
01:08:53,024 --> 01:08:55,526
Fucking stop! Stop!

645
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:05,536
Let me thefuck out!

646
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,251
Let me out!

647
01:09:12,293 --> 01:09:14,712
Get me out, you sickfuck!

648
01:09:14,754 --> 01:09:17,048
Fuck you!

649
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,258
Let me out.

650
01:09:23,096 --> 01:09:24,472
Do something.

651
01:09:24,514 --> 01:09:26,849
Do something to end this.

652
01:10:11,519 --> 01:10:14,439
I got bugs crawling
all over my body.

653
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,982
It gets worse.

654
01:10:18,818 --> 01:10:20,903
You're completely unprepared
for this.

655
01:10:20,987 --> 01:10:23,448
Ah, Dr. Kent,
we've been over all this.

656
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:25,617
Yes, but I've been
through the process.

657
01:10:25,658 --> 01:10:28,828
She went through the process,
too, and it didn't matter.

658
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,455
You don't know him.

659
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:41,424
Be lucky.

660
01:10:42,717 --> 01:10:44,427
Come on, guys.

661
01:10:51,768 --> 01:10:52,935
Ready?

662
01:10:53,936 --> 01:10:57,106
Peter, the first few minutes...

663
01:10:57,148 --> 01:10:58,858
will be very disorienting.

664
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,779
Rememberto stay calm
and focused.

665
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:07,617
Instincts play a very important
part here, so trust them.

666
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:08,785
All right.

667
01:11:08,826 --> 01:11:12,330
Peter, you've read her file.

668
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:14,415
Hit her with something personal.

669
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,418
And remember, Peter...

670
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,587
it's not real.

671
01:13:28,049 --> 01:13:30,051
Have you seen him? My boy?

672
01:13:30,093 --> 01:13:32,136
My little one?
His father took him from me.

673
01:13:32,178 --> 01:13:34,973
I spit it out my hole.
Big deal. don't mean anything.

674
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:37,892
My child's an abomination.
He has no soul.

675
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:52,800
Is that you?

676
01:14:52,842 --> 01:14:54,344
You all right?

677
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:15,990
Hold me.

678
01:15:20,662 --> 01:15:22,455
This isn't real.

679
01:15:22,497 --> 01:15:25,500
Did daddy do a bad thing?

680
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:36,219
Don't be scared.

681
01:15:58,825 --> 01:15:59,951
This isn't real.

682
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:23,201
Naughty worm.

683
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,434
I'll kill you!

684
01:17:48,476 --> 01:17:50,103
Fuck you, motherfucker!

685
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:55,525
Catherine,

686
01:18:01,698 --> 01:18:05,994
Mairzy doats and dozy doats

687
01:18:06,035 --> 01:18:10,415

01:18:10,456 --> 01:18:12,083
A kiddley divey, too

689
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:14,711
Wouldn't you?

690
01:18:16,462 --> 01:18:18,298
When you were in college...

691
01:18:20,216 --> 01:18:23,011
Your baby brother
had a car accident!

692
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:29,434
He was in a coma for six months
before he died!

693
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,438
And I'm sorry for saying that!

694
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:37,775
Butyou gotta wake up!

695
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:39,277
God!

696
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:43,865
It's not real.

697
01:18:56,628 --> 01:18:58,296
This is not real!

698
01:18:58,338 --> 01:19:00,214
This is not real!
Not real!

699
01:19:33,873 --> 01:19:35,959
It's OK.

700
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,377
What the fuck happened?

701
01:19:42,215 --> 01:19:43,341
Where are we?

702
01:19:55,603 --> 01:19:57,188
Oh, my God.

703
01:19:58,231 --> 01:19:59,399
Is this where he keeps them?

704
01:20:13,746 --> 01:20:15,707
No, it's OK.

705
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:21,045
Don't be scared.

706
01:20:21,087 --> 01:20:23,589
I will never hurt you.

707
01:20:23,631 --> 01:20:25,633
I'm your friend.

708
01:20:25,675 --> 01:20:28,344
And Peter--he's afriend, too.

709
01:20:31,556 --> 01:20:33,725
Do you know where this place is?

710
01:20:33,725 --> 01:20:35,727
Like on a map?

711
01:20:57,123 --> 01:20:59,250
I am so proud of you.

712
01:21:11,137 --> 01:21:14,474
Even if Peter
doesn't find Julia...

713
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:18,770
I promise I will come back
and help you.

714
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:20,229
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

715
01:21:21,814 --> 01:21:23,900
It's over.
I know how to find Julia.

716
01:21:23,942 --> 01:21:25,693
I just can't leave him here!

717
01:21:25,735 --> 01:21:27,862
God damn it, Catherine,
let's go!

718
01:21:27,904 --> 01:21:29,489
- Carl!
- I know how to find her.

719
01:21:36,788 --> 01:21:40,249
- Let's go!
- I'll come back for you, Carl!

720
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:41,960
I promise that I'll come back!

721
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:43,920
Catherine, we gotta go now!

722
01:21:57,058 --> 01:21:59,602
- That means he's back.
- How's Catherine?

723
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,898
Take it easy, Peter.

724
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:07,110
Is she OK?

725
01:22:08,194 --> 01:22:10,780
Take it easy, Peter.
Just breathe.

726
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:13,616
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, I think she is.

727
01:22:13,658 --> 01:22:16,160
Can you get me
out of this fucking suit?

728
01:22:38,182 --> 01:22:39,309
Yeah, Cole here.

729
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:41,436
- Cole, it's Novak.
- Yeah, what's up?

730
01:22:41,477 --> 01:22:43,563
I want you to go
down to the basement...

731
01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:46,357
at Stargher's workplace and
call me when you get down there.

732
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:47,483
They haven't finished
building the grid yet.

733
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:49,360
Fuck the grid!
Call me when you get down there.

734
01:22:49,402 --> 01:22:50,737
- You OK, Pete?
- I'm fine.

735
01:22:50,778 --> 01:22:51,988
You want to tell me
what happened in there?

736
01:22:53,448 --> 01:22:54,699
You in pain?

737
01:22:56,284 --> 01:22:58,578
- What happened, Peter?
- I saw her.

738
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,121
- Who did you see?
- I know where to find her.

739
01:23:00,163 --> 01:23:01,998
- Who?
- Julia. I saw her.

740
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:06,002
OK. Why don't you come and
let Dr. Kent have a look at you?

741
01:23:08,046 --> 01:23:09,714
- Cole?
- Yeah, this is Cole.

742
01:23:09,714 --> 01:23:11,341
Now, what am I doing down here?

743
01:23:11,382 --> 01:23:14,177
That machine that he uses--
there's a hoist.

744
01:23:14,218 --> 01:23:16,095
I want you to look
for a plaque...

745
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:18,598
or a metal plate
with some sort of logo on it.

746
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:22,060
Yeah, I got it.

747
01:23:22,101 --> 01:23:26,898
It's Carver
industrial equipment...

748
01:23:26,898 --> 01:23:30,443
in Bakersfield, California.

749
01:23:30,485 --> 01:23:32,236
I want you to find out
every goddamn thing...

750
01:23:32,236 --> 01:23:33,780
that you can
about that machine--

751
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:35,698
who used it, who sold it,
who bought it.

752
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,367
Just find out
everything you can.

753
01:23:37,408 --> 01:23:39,994
I'll call you from the chopper
in about twenty minutes.

754
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:42,956
All right, let me have a look.
Good.

755
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,878
The FBI has left the building.

756
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,130
What? I haven't had a chance
to clear Novak!

757
01:23:51,172 --> 01:23:52,882
What did you expect me to do?

758
01:23:54,467 --> 01:23:55,927
There's no way
I could stop them.

759
01:23:55,927 --> 01:23:57,095
Go.

760
01:23:58,471 --> 01:24:00,098
- I'm OK.
- Are you sure?

761
01:24:00,139 --> 01:24:01,432
Let me have a look.

762
01:24:04,477 --> 01:24:05,645
- All right.
- OK.

763
01:24:14,862 --> 01:24:16,114
Peter, just talk.

764
01:24:16,114 --> 01:24:19,284
What if your mind
is playing tricks on you?

765
01:24:19,325 --> 01:24:20,702
They shot you
full of drugs, Peter.

766
01:24:20,743 --> 01:24:22,453
Who knows
if what you saw is real?

767
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:36,301
Catherine, open this door.

768
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:42,140
- I promise...
- What are you doing?

769
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:43,641
I'm gonna help you.

770
01:24:43,683 --> 01:24:46,644
Stop.
Do not jeopardize your career.

771
01:24:50,315 --> 01:24:52,859
Stop! It's dangerous.
What are you doing?

772
01:25:23,139 --> 01:25:25,099
- Miriam.
- What's she doing?

773
01:25:25,141 --> 01:25:28,478
- You know what she's doing.
- For Christ's sake.

774
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:31,689
Jesus!

775
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:35,193
- She changed the codes.
- You can't get in without them?

776
01:25:35,193 --> 01:25:37,820
- She reversed the feeds.
- What does that mean?

777
01:25:37,862 --> 01:25:41,157
The process is intended
for her to go into his mind.

778
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,743
But instead,
she's bringing him into hers.

779
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:46,496
Stop! No more!

780
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:21,758
I promised I'd come back
and help you.

781
01:27:24,302 --> 01:27:26,763
See? I always keep my promises.

782
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:30,350
Can I stay here...

783
01:27:30,391 --> 01:27:31,935
with you?

784
01:27:31,976 --> 01:27:38,691
Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.
It doesn't work that way.

785
01:27:38,733 --> 01:27:42,153
There's nothing
I can do about that.

786
01:27:44,822 --> 01:27:46,282
Yes, there is.

787
01:27:53,498 --> 01:27:54,832
When I was a little boy...

788
01:27:57,502 --> 01:27:58,836
I found this bird.

789
01:28:01,756 --> 01:28:05,051
He was injured and...

790
01:28:05,093 --> 01:28:07,595
had a broken leg or something.

791
01:28:11,224 --> 01:28:13,434
Well, my father
found out that I had it.

792
01:28:15,853 --> 01:28:18,439
And I knew that he would
do something horrible to it.

793
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:22,735
It was just a matter of time.

794
01:28:24,237 --> 01:28:28,283
So I took it to the sink,
and I--I held it under.

795
01:28:32,996 --> 01:28:34,289
It was better for the bird.

796
01:28:37,458 --> 01:28:39,377
I saved him.

797
01:28:41,462 --> 01:28:43,631
I can't do that, Carl.

798
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,677
I won't.

799
01:28:51,264 --> 01:28:53,057
It doesn't matter.

800
01:29:01,482 --> 01:29:02,650
It found me.

801
01:29:05,737 --> 01:29:08,948
It always finds me.

802
01:30:03,962 --> 01:30:05,922
Agent Novak? Go ahead.

803
01:30:05,964 --> 01:30:08,091
- Cole?
- Novak, listen to this.

804
01:30:08,132 --> 01:30:10,760
The hoist was sold
to a guy named Bainbridge...

805
01:30:10,802 --> 01:30:12,971
who tried to build
a machine works out near Delano.

806
01:30:13,012 --> 01:30:15,306
Bainbridge
ends up in bankruptcy court...

807
01:30:15,306 --> 01:30:16,933
and the state winds up
with the land.

808
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:19,352
And guess who they hire
to seal the place up.

809
01:30:19,394 --> 01:30:20,812
Aw, you're fuckin' kiddin' me.

810
01:30:20,853 --> 01:30:22,313
No. I'm not the kidding type.

811
01:30:22,313 --> 01:30:24,816
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

812
01:30:24,857 --> 01:30:27,402
- Where's the land?
- Exit 10, off highway 99.

813
01:30:27,443 --> 01:30:29,654
- We're on our way now.
- Got it. I know where that is.

814
01:30:59,684 --> 01:31:01,394
Help! Help me!

815
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,610
This is the area.

816
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:22,790
My world...

817
01:31:22,832 --> 01:31:24,334
my rules.

818
01:31:51,694 --> 01:31:53,363
Help!

819
01:32:23,768 --> 01:32:26,229
Do it.

820
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:43,246
It's not real.

821
01:32:56,301 --> 01:32:59,846
Me got boy.

822
01:33:03,141 --> 01:33:07,729
Boy me got.

823
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,817
You cannot kill me.

824
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:32,146
It's OK.

825
01:34:34,148 --> 01:34:35,900
Save me.

826
01:34:48,329 --> 01:34:50,748
You can stay here with me.

827
01:35:12,103 --> 01:35:13,938
Here!

828
01:35:16,024 --> 01:35:18,151
It's OK. It's OK.

829
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:20,236
It's OK.
You've gotto back away.

830
01:35:20,278 --> 01:35:23,615
Scoot back. Back away!

831
01:35:23,615 --> 01:35:26,242
Back up from here. Back--

832
01:36:31,849 --> 01:36:33,685
it's OK.

833
01:36:33,685 --> 01:36:35,687
Are you OK?

834
01:36:35,687 --> 01:36:36,896
You OK?

835
01:36:43,987 --> 01:36:45,822
You're OK.

836
01:38:46,484 --> 01:38:47,610
Agent Ramsey?

837
01:38:47,652 --> 01:38:49,779
Yeah, Ramsey.

838
01:38:49,821 --> 01:38:51,239
She's here.

839
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:53,616
OK, let her through.

840
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:04,919
Somebody outside for you.

841
01:39:15,221 --> 01:39:17,098
What is she doing here?

842
01:39:18,516 --> 01:39:19,767
Said he wanted to see his home.

843
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,813
It's pretty strange.

844
01:39:23,855 --> 01:39:25,732
She's keeping his dog, Peter.

845
01:39:25,773 --> 01:39:28,192
I'd say pretty fucking strange
is par for the course.

846
01:39:39,787 --> 01:39:42,457
I almost didn't recognize you.

847
01:39:42,498 --> 01:39:44,250
How long do you getto be
a civilian?

848
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:46,461
A couple weeks...

849
01:39:46,502 --> 01:39:49,130
till after the inquiry
and see what happens.

850
01:39:53,301 --> 01:39:55,428
Ramsey told me
you were thinking of...

851
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:57,764
What do you call that thing?

852
01:39:57,805 --> 01:40:00,183
- Reversal?
- Reversal.

853
01:40:00,224 --> 01:40:01,559
With that kid
you were working with?

854
01:40:01,559 --> 01:40:03,561
- Yeah. Edward.
- Edward.

855
01:40:04,604 --> 01:40:05,980
Are you sure
you want to do that?

856
01:40:08,316 --> 01:40:09,692
Absolutely.

857
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:14,656
You're not worried about
what might happen?

858
01:40:16,491 --> 01:40:18,826
I would never do anything
to hurt Edward.

859
01:40:21,496 --> 01:40:23,498
It wasn't him
I was worried about.

860
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,961
What about you? How are you?

861
01:40:28,002 --> 01:40:29,796
I'm not sure. I...

862
01:40:31,339 --> 01:40:32,882
I remember pieces of everything.

863
01:40:36,177 --> 01:40:38,346
According to the FBl...

864
01:40:38,388 --> 01:40:44,227
you guys put me on some
drug-fueled mind-benderfirst...

865
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:46,688
then triggered a memory
I already had...

866
01:40:46,729 --> 01:40:49,315
and officially
we found Julia Hickson...

867
01:40:49,357 --> 01:40:50,900
through good old-fashioned
detective work.

868
01:40:58,032 --> 01:40:59,867
I guess this is
hello and good-bye, then.

869
01:41:02,078 --> 01:41:03,246
I guess so.

870
01:41:10,295 --> 01:41:11,963
Thanks for everything,
Catherine.

871
01:41:24,142 --> 01:41:26,352
- Be safe.
- All right.
