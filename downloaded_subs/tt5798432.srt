1
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:34,517
Yeah, follow me through here.
I'll show you the showroom.

2
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,258
Cool.

3
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,695
Actually, um, Oz...

4
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:41,350
Oz, do you, uh, have a sec?

5
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,873
Can you show this
young lady around?

6
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:46,007
Uh, well never mind.

7
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,400
Just, uh, do your thing.

8
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,097
Tunnel vision.

9
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:52,579
Uh, well, I think we have, uh,

10
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,755
a few things from the
'90s you might be into.

11
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:55,930
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.

12
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,932
Great. All right, I'll show you.

13
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,037
Um...

14
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,168
Uh, sorry.

15
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,128
Uh, just hold on a second.
I'm...

16
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,740
Where.

17
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:26,047
Never mind.

18
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,396
I'll find it later.

19
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:31,226
Hey, listen, did you get
that old '83 up and running?

20
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,836
Yeah, I think so.

21
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,360
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,448
Well, I'm gonna kick your ass

23
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,579
in a head-to-head
here in a minute.

24
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,668
Yeah.

25
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,018
Don't you laugh at me, you
little millennial motherfucker.

26
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,585
I'm gonna pop you right
in the starfish.

27
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:45,588
Whoa. Okay. God.

28
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,764
Hey, what'd you
think of that girl?

29
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:50,680
Uh... girl? What girl?

30
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,074
The girl that was
in here earlier.

31
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,511
Oh, my God. You are hopeless.

32
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:58,775
I got her phone number.
You wanna call her?

33
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,255
No, that's creepy.

34
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,344
Come on. Oh, that's not creepy.
Call her.

35
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,085
How is that not creepy?
That's...

36
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:07,393
Well, fine. Suit yourself.

37
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,264
Um...

38
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,442
Listen, um...

39
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,272
I got some bad news.

40
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:20,841
Uh, it looks like...

41
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:24,279
we're gonna have
to close up shop.

42
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,501
Close up, like f...
Like, forever?

43
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,591
Yeah, we're just not getting

44
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,158
the business that
we used to get.

45
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,986
23 years I've been here.

46
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,338
I thought I'd make
it to 25, but...

47
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,688
You okay?

48
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:45,822
Yeah, yeah, I'm just,
uh, a little confused.

49
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:46,823
Yeah, me too.

50
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,085
I never understood

51
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:51,175
why arcades went outta
fashion in the first place,

52
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,655
so what the hell do I know?

53
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,091
You know a lot.

54
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,924
How long?

55
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,710
A month?

56
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:05,886
You got any savings?

57
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:08,192
Yeah, I think so.

58
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,499
Like a couple hundred...

59
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,850
Like a hun... Like
a hundred bucks.

60
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,156
Okay.

61
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,420
Well, look here.

62
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:22,337
I would not be here today
if it wasn't for you

63
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,339
and all the great
work that you did,

64
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,737
so I think it's only fair that
we split everything 50/50.

65
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you serious?

66
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:36,351
Yeah, I'm serious.
You deserve it.

67
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:39,702
Thank you.

68
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,705
Hey, listen, I gotta go up
north for a couple weeks...

69
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,577
Family bullshit.

70
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,231
So, you're gonna have
to look after the shop,

71
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,929
take care of things.

72
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,931
All right.

73
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,802
All right, I tell you what,

74
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,500
why don't you just take
the rest of the day off

75
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,545
and, uh, go get drunk?

76
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:57,894
You know?

77
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:00,593
Can I give you some
old man advice?

78
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:04,118
Uh, don't just go and get
another job in a repair shop.

79
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,555
You're better than that.

80
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,867
Go and find something
that you really wanna do.

81
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:17,566
You spend enough time making
other people's games beautiful.

82
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,526
Do something for you, okay?

83
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,101
- You ready for another?
- Yeah, thanks.

84
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,974
- There ya go.
- Thanks.

85
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,457
Hey, Audrey.

86
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,197
Hey, Tess. Tom Cat?

87
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,939
Yes, please.

88
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,901
What's on?

89
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,469
What?

90
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,601
What are you... What
are you lookin' at?

91
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,950
It's pretty intense,
whatever it is.

92
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:55,430
Uh, what?

93
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,259
On the TV.

94
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,348
It's off.

95
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:04,614
Yeah, I know it's off.

96
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,052
Okay, okay, start over.

97
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,881
I'm Tess.

98
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,623
Oz.

99
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,798
Wait. Oz?

100
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,321
Really?

101
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,846
Yeah, it's short for Osgood.

102
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,371
I'm sorry. Have we met before?

103
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,199
Do you not remember
me from earlier?

104
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,461
Were you the girl
from the, uh...

105
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,071
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

106
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:31,554
I was looking for a game for
my brother for his birthday.

107
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:37,646
Actually, that is totally a lie.

108
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,953
I don't know why I
just said that.

109
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,302
I told your boss the same thing,

110
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,696
but I never had any intention
of buying anything.

111
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,219
I just...

112
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,135
I just wanted to come and,
like, check out the games.

113
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,790
Why would you lie about that?

114
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,661
I don't know. 'Cause I
thought it'd be weird

115
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:53,967
if I just rolled up and said,

116
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:56,360
"Hey can I come play
some video games?"

117
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:59,016
But I-it's an arcade-game shop.

118
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,325
Yeah.

119
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,982
Yeah, when you, uh...

120
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,375
When you put it like
that, it makes sense.

121
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,986
Oh, my God.

122
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,902
17.

123
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,776
Oz?

124
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:25,868
Hey, I thought I told you to get
outta here and go get drunk.

125
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:29,090
I'm about to head
out myself, so...

126
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,051
Oz?

127
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,186
Hey. Oz.

128
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,240
Oz!

129
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,205
Where are you?

130
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,311
What the hell is that?

131
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:35,678
You weren't supposed to be here.

132
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,909
I'm so sorry, Jerry.

133
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,843
Have you ever tried a Tom Cat?

134
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,496
No. What is that?

135
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,977
It's a kind of gin,
but it's so good.

136
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:17,545
It's smoky like mescal. Try it.

137
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,503
- No, uh, I'm good.
- Try it. Come on.

138
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,158
- Okay.
- Don't be a baby.

139
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:24,987
Right?

140
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:27,337
That's actually...
That is really good.

141
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:29,644
Like gin and mescal had a baby.

142
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,952
Yeah. Exactly.

143
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:36,825
I hope this doesn't
sound too creepy.

144
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,784
I've totally seen
you in here before.

145
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,524
- Really?
- Yeah.

146
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:43,614
I don't remember you. Well, I usually
sit over there in that corner,

147
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:46,705
with my notebook, making notes.

148
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,837
- You're a writer?
- I'm a writer by night.

149
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,100
By day, I'm a receptionist.

150
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:54,190
Well, technically, I
work for a temp agency.

151
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,977
I'm on unemployment.
I'm unemployed.

152
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:07,247
If you ever wanna get, like, a
drink or coffee or whatever

153
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:11,294
somewhere else sometime...
you could have my number.

154
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:15,082
Well, um, act... the thing is,
I don't really have a phone.

155
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,302
That's, like, the lamest
excuse I've ever heard.

156
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:20,826
No, I... Really, I don't.

157
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,089
I don't. You can ask anyone.

158
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,568
Really?

159
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,613
Mnh-mnh.

160
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,920
- How do you call people?
- Pay phones.

161
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,182
They still make those?

162
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,227
I-I guess.

163
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,580
Wow.

164
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,757
You're an antique.

165
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,934
I've been told that
before, actually.

166
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:44,588
Okay, well, how should
we do this, Osgood?

167
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,590
Um...

168
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:49,071
I could send my
carrier pigeon over.

169
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,770
Or smoke signals. We
could do smoke signals.

170
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,773
Um, I'm gonna be at
the arcade all...

171
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,123
All day tomorrow if
you wanna come by.

172
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,255
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be awesome.

173
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,127
I'm gonna leave around
4:00, go get some dinner.

174
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,389
If you haven't eaten,

175
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,913
maybe, if you wanted,
you could come with me.

176
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,567
- Perfect.
- Yeah?

177
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:07,568
Yeah, that sounds great.

178
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:13,313
All right, see you
tomorrow, Osgood.

179
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,619
I'll see ya.

180
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,319
Sorry if this was weird.

181
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,842
No, not weird.

182
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,365
- It was a little weird.
- Unh-unh.

183
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,759
Tess.

184
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,441
Oh.

185
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,632
Oh, shit.

186
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,201
Hey.

187
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,159
- Hey.
- Hey, you showed up.

188
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,684
S... Uh, sorry I'm late.

189
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,123
Uh, come on.

190
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,222
So, did you, like, just
wake up or something?

191
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,747
- Yeah. Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.

192
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:37,142
I just... I had, like, a
really late night last night.

193
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,839
That's cool.

194
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,536
Yeah.

195
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:41,798
Is your boss gonna be mad

196
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,801
that you just are
opening up shop now?

197
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:48,110
No. No one ever comes by here.

198
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,852
Well, except for me.

199
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,730
Where do you find
all this stuff?

200
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,384
All over, really.

201
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:05,083
Um, like junkyards
and garage sales

202
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,694
and side of the road and stuff.

203
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:10,566
Yeah, I just... I restore
the ones that I can

204
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,091
and the other ones I
just sorta fix up.

205
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,267
I'll paint the sides.

206
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:17,617
Sometimes I'll just
build a whole new one

207
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,314
using an existing circuit board,

208
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,142
and, yeah, I like to think of it

209
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:24,277
as bringing the
dead back to life.

210
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,106
Very noble.

211
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,249
Cool!

212
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,816
Do you just imagine, like,

213
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,166
sweeping orchestral music
every time you do that?

214
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,255
'Cause I would.

215
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,039
Definitely will now.

216
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,476
You got any quarters?

217
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:51,738
Oh, it's all free.

218
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:54,784
What? Your boss made me pay
yesterday when I came in.

219
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,788
You guys are a bunch of dinguses.
You know that?

220
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,400
This is the one that I saw online
that made me wanna come in.

221
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,184
I used to play it in the
movie-theater lobby

222
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,665
when my parents were
seeing R-rated films.

223
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,279
Mm.

224
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,854
All right, I'm a little
out of practice.

225
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:23,683
Um, so I know that you just
woke up and everything,

226
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,206
but do you wanna
still get lunch?

227
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,816
- Totally.
- Okay, cool.

228
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,166
I know a really good spot.

229
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,133
I hope you weren't expecting
anything too fancy.

230
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,613
I don't really do restaurants.

231
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,355
Mm, no, this is perfect.
It's tacos and it's beer.

232
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,878
I mean, you can't do
better than that.

233
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,401
Right?

234
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:49,012
Sometimes I like to sit up here
and look out over the city

235
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,710
and pretend like this
alien invasion is coming

236
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,886
and they're about to
wipe out the entire town

237
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:56,106
and I'm protected and safe up
here with my tacos and my beer

238
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,717
just watching the
whole thing go down.

239
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,762
What do you do after you finish
your tacos and your beer?

240
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,851
Well, I go to the Sword Emporium
like 45 minutes north of here

241
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,462
and I grab a couple
samurai swords

242
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,333
and then I go hole
up in some motel

243
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,856
right by the vending machine

244
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:08,467
and then I wait for, like,
the army convoy to come by

245
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:11,383
and them to join forces with
Will Smith and then I team up.

246
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,949
Wow. You've really
thought about this.

247
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,083
Yep, every day.

248
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,391
Was that just, like,
major nerd central,

249
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:22,394
or was that a bonding moment?

250
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,004
- Or both?
- Both, I think.

251
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,875
I think it was both.

252
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:28,574
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not...

253
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,880
I'm usually just really
bad at communication,

254
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:34,406
so when, um, things are going
well, I get all in my head,

255
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,146
and I-I think that I'm
doing something wrong

256
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,061
and then it ends up being bad.

257
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:40,455
Yeah, I-I do the same thing,

258
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,849
except I always end
up talking a lot,

259
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,807
which I'm sure you've
noticed by now.

260
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,272
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

261
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:30,070
I really like you, Oz.
I think you're cool.

262
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,942
Um...

263
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:35,945
I don't know.

264
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,818
I-I feel like I'd be down
to hang out tomorrow,

265
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,255
if you are... I
mean, not tomorrow.

266
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,997
Like, when ever you're free.
It could be whenever.

267
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,477
But, like, soon.

268
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,088
Sorry I'm talking so much. I
do this when I get nervous.

269
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:51,396
Why are you nervous?
I'm nervous.

270
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,181
- Why are you nervous?
- Because...

271
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,880
you're definitely the prettiest
girl that's ever kissed me.

272
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:01,275
You're really sweet.

273
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:02,321
It's true.

274
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,759
Okay, let's go.

275
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,761
- Okay.
- Come on.

276
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,649
Tess?

277
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:32,307
Jerry?

278
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:44,318
Hey, man, look, you
can't be in here.

279
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,625
All right?

280
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:50,977
Don't make me call the cops.

281
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,282
You plugged in.

282
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:53,980
Huh?

283
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:56,374
Is it beautiful?

284
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,332
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

285
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,899
The White Eye.

286
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,988
It looks at you, doesn't it?

287
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,120
Yeah, you gotta go, man.

288
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:05,514
Just let me touch it.

289
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,822
Ow!

290
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,651
Shit!

291
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:18,396
Don't just look into the void.

292
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,529
Let the void look into you.

293
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:16,791
Okay, but why haven't you yet?

294
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,577
I don't know. It just
takes a lot to make a game.

295
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,448
It's a lot of work.
Takes a lot of time.

296
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:24,233
I know that. Answer
the question.

297
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:28,760
Uh, money is a thing that
it takes that I don't have.

298
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:31,110
Well, we could raise money.

299
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,721
If I... If I... If I had
one chance to do it,

300
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,767
I would just wanna make
sure it was perfect.

301
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:36,985
You know? I wouldn't wanna...

302
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:40,554
Oz, if you tried even half
as hard as anybody else,

303
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,730
you could make something better
than like 80% of the shit

304
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,079
that comes out every year.

305
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,559
I don't know. I just...
I just...

306
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,737
I want my first thing to be
my absolute best, you know?

307
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:51,913
I don't wanna... I don't
wanna half ass anything.

308
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,654
You can't think
that way, though.

309
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,787
Miyamoto's first game
was "Donkey Kong."

310
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,963
- Uh, no. No.
- Yeah.

311
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,399
No, no, no, no, no.

312
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,532
Miyamoto worked on a ton of other
games before "Donkey Kong."

313
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,187
"Radar Scope"? Hello?

314
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:07,320
- Oh, yeah. That's true.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

315
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,931
Well, I dunno. It doesn't
really matter anyway now

316
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,454
'cause I'm about to
be out of a job.

317
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,850
What do you mean you're...
You're about to be out of a job?

318
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,939
They're closing this place down.

319
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,289
About to sell all
of our inventory.

320
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,335
Gonna put some shitty
mattress place in here

321
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,251
in like six months.

322
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,124
Shit.

323
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,343
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

324
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,954
Mm, it is what it is.

325
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,130
It's gonna be okay.

326
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,089
You know what I think?

327
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,308
What?

328
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,659
I think this is it for you.

329
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,922
- Thank you, I think?
- No. No. No, no, no.

330
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,924
Not... Not like,
this is itfor you,

331
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,143
but, like, thisis it for you.

332
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:50,015
It's a thing that my mom
used to say all the time.

333
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:53,366
It means that everybody
gets an "it" moment,

334
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:56,674
and it's when everything
in the universe

335
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,501
and all around just
aligns perfectly

336
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,503
so that you see exactly
what you should be doing

337
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,070
with the rest of your life.

338
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:05,073
Right? So for Miyamoto,
it was "Donkey Kong,"

339
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,162
or, like, when Doc Brown
falls on the toilet

340
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,468
and sli... and hits his head?

341
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,513
Right?

342
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,820
And they see it and
they follow it

343
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:15,214
and... and... and stuff changes.

344
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,869
Stuff happens for them, right?

345
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,176
This is it for you.
This is your moment.

346
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:28,271
That's just my two cents.

347
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,013
Can I tell you a secret?

348
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,146
Only if it's a good one.

349
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,930
I've never told a soul.

350
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,932
What is it?

351
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,847
Come here.

352
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,937
Okay, so, a couple of years ago,

353
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:46,811
uh, I made this kinda...
Uh, I made a thing.

354
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,334
I knew it. I knew it.

355
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:52,164
Well, it's called, uh,
"Lazer Balls," so...

356
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,122
Yeah, it's, like, the
dumbest fuckin' name

357
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:55,820
I've ever heard of in my life.

358
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:58,561
Furthermore, I-I never hired,
like, an artist to do...

359
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,912
- No, it's cool.
- Any renderings or anything,

360
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:02,696
so it just doesn't
look very good,

361
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:05,220
but I think, you know, the
general idea is there.

362
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:08,571
And, just, like, the
infrastructure's good.

363
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,617
I just need someone
to take a look at it

364
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,358
and make it sharp
and make it smooth

365
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,840
and make it, you know,
something people would see.

366
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,319
Tess?

367
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,409
Tess?

368
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,368
Hey, are you okay?

369
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,891
Yeah.

370
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:27,590
Yeah, I just zoned
out for a second.

371
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,592
What's that game over there?
- Aw, it's nothing.

372
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:31,725
It doesn't even work. It's...
- But what is it?

373
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,553
It's some piece of
shit that came in.

374
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,468
We don't... Doesn't work.
- Should we try it?

375
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:38,079
No, we should go get a drink.
That's what we should do.

376
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,864
- Oz, you're still sick.
- No.

377
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:43,171
You shouldn't be drinking.
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

378
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:46,609
And I'm taking a very big health
risk even hanging out with you.

379
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,568
- Uh...
- You could be Carrier X.

380
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,700
- I could.
- Yeah.

381
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,528
Hey.

382
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,097
Hey.

383
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:41,577
What are you doing up?

384
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:44,450
I do this every night.

385
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,147
What?

386
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:47,715
You're crazy.

387
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:53,024
Hey, are you okay?

388
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:56,375
Just, every shitty
thought I've ever had

389
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,333
just comes to me at
3:00 in the morning.

390
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:00,858
And couple that with the fact

391
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,558
I've got this gorgeous
girl in bed next to me...

392
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,651
I don't know. The last few
days have been a lot.

393
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:14,523
Just kinda like my mind
is working overtime.

394
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:17,222
I read somewhere once

395
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:19,920
that when you wake up
at 3:00 in the morning,

396
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,879
it means that your
brain is operating

397
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,229
at a higher level
than most people's.

398
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,447
Really?

399
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:28,363
Yeah. Thomas Edison,
I think it was,

400
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,626
he only slept for like
45 minutes at a time.

401
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,106
Hmm.

402
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:36,241
It's either that, or you're
being possessed by demons.

403
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:39,331
- It's probably that.
- Yeah, probably.

404
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:42,421
Earlier when you were
in the bathroom,

405
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:46,338
I walked by your desk and I saw
something that made me think,

406
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,166
"I really know who this guy is."

407
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,603
Uh-oh.

408
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:54,433
There was this stack of old
"King's Quest" floppy disks

409
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:57,740
just sitting there on your
desk waiting to be installed.

410
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:00,395
It reminded me of this
Tamagotchi that I used to have.

411
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:01,657
I wore it on my key chain,

412
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:05,183
for, like, years after
I last used it,

413
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,576
just in case I ever wanted
to fire it up again.

414
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,970
Don't they die when you
don't take care of 'em?

415
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:13,234
Yeah, yeah, it... it was dead.

416
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,323
Rest in peace.

417
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,759
I'm just telling
you that because,

418
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,893
if one of the things that
you're up thinking about

419
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:24,593
is the person in bed
with you right now,

420
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:27,596
you should strike
that off your list,

421
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:31,470
'cause this is easy,
this is good.

422
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:34,604
Relax.

423
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:41,175
Relax.

424
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,702
Relax.

425
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,882
Relax.

426
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,279
Relax.

427
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,284
Tess? Tess? Tess? Tess?

428
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:08,202
Tess? Tess? Tess? Tess?

429
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,291
What'd you think of that girl?

430
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:14,295
Tess? Tess? One, zero,
zero, zero, zero, one.

431
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:17,124
You're definitely the prettiest
girl that's ever kissed me.

432
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,867
Tess? Tess? Why are you nervous?
I'm nervous.

433
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,521
Tess? Tess?

434
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:24,262
I think this is it for you.

435
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:27,439
Tess? Tess?

436
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,962
Who are you?

437
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,182
Tess? Tess?

438
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:33,533
Tess! Tess!

439
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,320
Relax.

440
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,800
Relax.

441
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,846
Relax.

442
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:38,613
Made of duct tape,

443
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:40,311
so they slashed the
tires on my car...

444
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:41,442
- I did that.
- And threw it in the snow...

445
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,618
I-I used to make them, too.

446
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,446
- You made duct-tape wallets?
- Uh-huh.

447
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:46,969
Did you sell them
for lots of money?

448
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,146
No, I just gave them away
for free to my friends.

449
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,973
- That's so generous of you.
- I know.

450
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:54,499
My friend, Michael Neukirk, he
wore a duct-tape tux to prom.

451
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,631
- Ooh, that's cool.
- He looked like a fuckin' idiot.

452
00:35:56,632 --> 00:36:00,157
No, that's cool. I used
to, back when I...

453
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,668
I'm so stoned.

454
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:36,018
I know. Me too. I wanna
play video games.

455
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:41,981
- What?
- What the fuck?

456
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,288
Oh, did you turn it on?

457
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:47,769
No, it just keeps
turning on by itself.

458
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,380
Maybe it's haunted.

459
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:50,468
Probably.

460
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,731
Ooooh. No! No, no, no.
I wanna play it.

461
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:54,994
- No, you don't.
- Uh, yeah, yeah, I do.

462
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:57,170
I don't think you do.
It's gonna make you puke.

463
00:36:57,171 --> 00:37:00,173
- What?
- I'm serious.

464
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:01,479
Do it. You can play.

465
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,784
It's just gonna
ruin your night...

466
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:04,438
Maybe your life, I don't know.

467
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,354
Oh, well, sounds like you think

468
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:09,704
maybe it's gonna ruin yournight.

469
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,924
- What are you talkin' about?

470
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:16,058
Like, maybe you think you're
not gonna get any action.

471
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,322
Well, that is something that
I had thought about before.

472
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,150
It did cross my mind, yeah.

473
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:27,026
My libido is perfectly
intact, mister,

474
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:32,205
so if your ego can take a
beating, we'll be just fine.

475
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:35,513
All right, which one turns it on?
This one?

476
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:37,428
Don't you dare touch that!

477
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:40,213
Shit, dude, you can't be in here. Get
outta here! Who does she think she is?!

478
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,259
Who the hell do you
think youare?!

479
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,304
Go, go, go, go, go.
Call the police.

480
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,175
Hey. Hey! You gotta go, man.

481
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,308
You forget yourself?
What the fuck?

482
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,441
No more distractions, all right?
You have a path.

483
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:52,443
- Get offa me.
- That is an impossibility.

484
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,880
- Let go of me.
- Hey!

485
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:20,209
Hey.

486
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,256
Are you awake?

487
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:20,205
Hey.

488
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:22,250
Hey.

489
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,948
You okay?

490
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:25,906
Yeah.

491
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:29,954
You know you were supposed to
come by last night, right?

492
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,738
I was?

493
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:33,435
Yeah, at 8:00.

494
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:37,135
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
I-I totally forgot.

495
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:40,355
I spent, like, all... all
night last night at the shop.

496
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:42,401
No worries.

497
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:44,708
I was just worried, is all.

498
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:45,970
I'm fine.

499
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:47,276
Are you sure?

500
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:52,672
I threw up last night. I
ruined a bunch of stuff.

501
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:56,720
Can you please go see a doctor?

502
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,852
Oz?

503
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:00,462
It's just, I... There's a ton
of stuff to do here. I...

504
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:02,943
Do you want me to bring you
some soup or something?

505
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:04,205
I can come by.

506
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:05,120
No.

507
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,121
Okay.

508
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,820
Um...

509
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:11,299
Well, I still really
think you should go...

510
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,520
For fuck's sake, Tess, I'm fine.

511
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:16,609
Okay.

512
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,264
You need to trust me.

513
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:23,007
I do trust you. It's
not about that.

514
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,922
I just... I don't know.

515
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:28,186
There's something up
with you right now.

516
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:30,319
Maybe this is how I really am.

517
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:34,323
I don't believe that.

518
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:40,720
Listen, if you need anything
or you wanna talk, I'm here.

519
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:44,289
Otherwise I'll just... I'll
let you do your thing, okay?

520
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,465
Okay.

521
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,380
Sorry I yelled at you.

522
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:51,122
It's fine.

523
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,255
I'll talk to you later.

524
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,258
Bye, Oz.

525
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,566
Bye.

526
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,615
Ow! Fuck!

527
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:53,228
Fucking idiot.

528
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,023
The White Eye.

529
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:08,765
The White Eye.

530
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,115
The White Eye.

531
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:13,639
The White Eye.

532
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,554
It looks at you, doesn't it?

533
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:19,297
Doesn't it?

534
00:47:28,323 --> 00:47:31,151
No.

535
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,032
Ones and zeros.

536
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:43,860
Intelligent design.

537
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,080
Made from chaos to chaos.

538
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:50,911
Oh, it is so beautiful.

539
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:55,306
I will do what he cannot.

540
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:12,932
No!

541
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:17,502
God!

542
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,770
I know.

543
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:27,207
I know.

544
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:32,647
I must choose...

545
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,475
what Ichoose.

546
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:36,347
Alone.

547
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:33,056
Ugh, quit checking your phone.

548
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:34,622
Hmm?

549
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:36,668
It's amazing what you can see
in the bottom of a tumbler

550
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:39,192
if you actually look.

551
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:43,283
Been a source of inspiration for
a lot of writers before you.

552
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:44,589
Well, maybe I'll quit
checking my phone

553
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,591
if you guys get the TV fixed.

554
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:48,114
I'm in no hurry.

555
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:50,943
People don't talk to each
other when the TV's on.

556
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:53,686
- Sure.
- You all right?

557
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:58,037
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine

558
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:01,040
I just...

559
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,956
I'm confused. And annoyed.

560
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:07,046
But... I'm fine.

561
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,830
I am confused and
annoyed most days.

562
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:11,833
Quit thinkin' about him.

563
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:13,183
I don't know what
he said to you,

564
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:14,619
but whatever it is,
it's not nice,

565
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,622
and anyone who is not nice
to you does not deserve you.

566
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:20,059
Yeah, I know. I just...

567
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,236
I felt like I was talking
to somebody else.

568
00:50:23,237 --> 00:50:25,195
Unless it was literally
a different person,

569
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:26,718
then he is exactly who
he's always been.

570
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:27,936
You just didn't know it.

571
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:29,808
Now you do.

572
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:32,637
Just quit checking your phone.

573
00:50:32,638 --> 00:50:36,554
Nothing good appears on that
screen after 10:00 p.m.

574
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:41,272
Oz?

575
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,230
Oz?

576
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:50,976
Oz, you left the door open.

577
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,365
Oh, my God! Tess!

578
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,020
Tess.

579
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,630
Tess!

580
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,677
Tess! Tess! Please,
please, please.

581
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:35,914
Do you see?

582
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:39,918
Who are you?

583
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:44,356
Who are you?

584
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:46,619
I didn't kill the girl.

585
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,100
- Yes, you did.
- No.

586
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:51,842
You have to break it.

587
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,017
It's unbeatable.

588
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:55,323
The game killed her?

589
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:58,501
The game did nothing.

590
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:02,896
When you play by its rules...

591
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,681
it'll always win.

592
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:06,640
Did you build this?

593
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:10,688
We built this.

594
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,820
What is it?

595
00:57:13,821 --> 00:57:16,693
A door to the infinite.

596
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:17,911
What does that mean?

597
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:19,086
We're in prison.

598
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:23,177
And where there's a prison,
there are walls...

599
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:25,223
Walls that cannot be toppled,

600
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:27,921
walls that cannot be climbed.

601
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:31,098
You can't escape this prison.

602
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:34,580
On this side...

603
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:37,235
it's hell.

604
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:39,672
You dream...

605
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:43,111
but then you wake up
from these dreams.

606
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:47,114
And then you die,

607
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:50,683
and all the beautiful things
in your dreams die with you.

608
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:54,774
But on the other side, there's
time enough for it all,

609
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:58,865
because there is no time.

610
00:57:58,866 --> 00:58:01,215
And in the infinite,

611
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:03,522
all things are not
just possible.

612
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,744
They're inevitable.

613
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:09,920
So I can save her.

614
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:12,183
No.

615
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:15,882
You have a higher purpose.

616
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:18,276
If all things are possible,
then she's still alive!

617
00:58:18,277 --> 00:58:20,278
No! No!

618
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:23,890
Delete the sequence.

619
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:26,153
Un... Unset decimal,
unset decimal,

620
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,720
F, F-94, 15, 19...

621
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,505
What the fuck are
you talking about?!

622
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,769
You have a responsibility!

623
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:36,164
Look beyond what's
in front of you.

624
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:40,472
Delete the senses.

625
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:44,955
Break the sequence.

626
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,660
Be the man I could never be.

627
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,372
Tess: Oz...

628
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:04,730
Look between the
ones and zeroes!

629
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:09,648
Hit reset!

630
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,801
Get outta here before
I call the cops.

631
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:22,455
Maybe he likes arcade games.

632
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:29,158
Oz.

633
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:33,162
I'm so sorry, Jerry.

634
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:37,122
Maybe this is how I really am.

635
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:38,689
Be the man I could never be.

636
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,299
Did you build this?

637
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,953
We built this.

638
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:34,788
Oz!

639
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:54,547
Oz?!

640
01:09:51,143 --> 01:09:52,622
Oz?!

641
01:09:59,847 --> 01:10:02,284
You can have both.

642
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,156
Look between the
ones and zeroes, Oz.

643
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:07,246
Hit reset.

644
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:10,423
No!

645
01:14:01,828 --> 01:14:03,439
Hey, Jerry.

646
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:07,529
Yeah, what's up?

647
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,096
Hey, is it cool if I use
the phone for a sec?

648
01:14:10,097 --> 01:14:11,576
I think I finally
found an artist.

649
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:12,751
Like, this guy's incredible.

650
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:14,623
I saw his pixel art, and
it's just exactly...

651
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:15,972
Yeah, you can call
him in a minute.

652
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:17,887
Uh...

653
01:14:17,888 --> 01:14:20,585
first, there's a girl coming
by to look at a game.

654
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:23,109
Would you show her around for me?
Okay.

655
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,111
- Thanks.
- Sure.

656
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:28,724
I'm gonna go close this deal.

657
01:14:28,725 --> 01:14:30,595
It's an end of an era.

658
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:34,643
Eh, it's gonna be okay.

659
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:36,906
Yeah.
