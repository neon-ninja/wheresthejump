1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,998
Hello, Matthew,
what are you doing here so late?

2
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,799
I came to get the books.
I want to study our accounts.

3
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,836
We've been doing very well lately.

4
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,150
Over 200 paid admissions today.

5
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,470
You call that good Saturday business?

6
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,836
If you weren't so stubborn,
we'd be turning them away from here.

7
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,195
Who cares a hang about history in wax?

8
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,669
There are people in the world
who love beauty.

9
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,149
But more who want sensation, shock!

10
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,517
Morbidly curious! I won't cater to them.

11
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,989
Their money is as good as anybody else's.

12
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,117
You should have seen them turning
them away at that Wax Museum...

13
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,998
on 23rd Street tonight: The Eden Musée.

14
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,594
The story's the same at
Madame Tussaud's in London.

15
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,274
- If you'd only listened to me...
- I know, Matthew.

16
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,313
I'd put in a Chamber of Horrors:
Murder, torture, executions...

17
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,756
scare the life out of people.
I don't care for that kind of patronage!

18
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,876
You're a great artist, a genius sculptor.

19
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,475
I'm an ordinary businessman who wants
a quick return on his investment.

20
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,472
I've put $20,000
in this historic peep show of yours.

21
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,030
- I could use that to better advantage.
- All right, Matthew.

22
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,716
I've known for some time
you wanted to dissolve our partnership.

23
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,314
- I may be able to accommodate you.
- How?

24
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,753
A friend is bringing Sidney Wallace,
the art critic, to see my work tonight.

25
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,312
Wallace is rich, and I think
I might persuade him to buy you out.

26
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,277
That sounds interesting.

27
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,154
- I'll want a profit on my investment.
- Yes, Matthew.

28
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,119
I understand.

29
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,432
You leave everything to me,
and I promise you it will be...

30
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,993
- That should be they, now.
- I'll wait in the office.

31
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,150
I've heard of Wallace.
He has a pot of money.

32
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,879
If he likes your stuff, put a stiff price on it.

33
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,748
- Does Jarrod live here?
- Yes, he has a room upstairs.

34
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,479
You'll like him, Sidney.
He speaks your language.

35
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,954
Please come in.
I'm happy to see you, Bruce.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,195
I thought you wouldn't come
on such a bad night.

37
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,589
We were delayed.
He had to be at a gallery.

38
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,557
Mr. Sidney Wallace. Professor Jarrod.

39
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,471
- A pleasure.
- For me also, Professor.

40
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,393
That title was bestowed on me
when I became an exhibitor.

41
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,550
It has little to do with my real work.

42
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,234
If you come, I will show you
what that work is.

43
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,436
The visit of such a distinguished critic...

44
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,750
may cause my children
to become conceited.

45
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,674
To you, they're wax. But to me,
their creator, they live and breathe.

46
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,838
Here we have two great lovers
from the past.

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,437
Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt,
and Mark Antony. Their last meeting.

48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,518
You'll recall, Antony,
believing Cleopatra to be dead...

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,272
killed himself with his own sword.

50
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,716
When Cleopatra found out what happened,
she quickly followed her lover.

51
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,519
You noticed how cleverly
the hair is mounted on the scalp?

52
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,158
Yes. How do you do that?

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,118
Real hair of the proper color and texture...

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,272
is pressed into the slightly warmed wax
with a scalpel...

55
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,713
one hair at a time.

56
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,997
Each wave and curl
of the subject's own hair is reproduced.

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,635
Here's President Lincoln and his assassin,
John Wilkes Booth...

58
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,314
one of my few concessions
to the macabre.

59
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,394
That's the best figure of Booth I've ever
seen. You almost expect him to speak.

60
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,790
- I wonder what he'd say.
- I'm sure he'd rant a bit.

61
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,668
Even after he shot Lincoln and jumped
from the President's box onto the stage...

62
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,672
he couldn't resist turning to the audience
and taking a bow.

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,796
I found him a very stubborn person.

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,199
- Stubborn?
- Unbelievably.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,398
For days I argued with this fellow
before he posed the way I wanted him to.

66
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,954
- You mean, he talked back to you?
- Of course.

67
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,754
It's not easy to shut an actor's mouth.

68
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,550
These groups are like
dimensional paintings of the old masters.

69
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,713
This is not only a great show,
it's an art exhibit.

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,392
That's what I told you.

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,912
Here we have Joan of Arc,
a favorite subject of mine.

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,912
- I understand that. It's beautifully done.
- Thank you.

73
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,909
I've done her over a dozen times,
and still she doesn't complain.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,115
What was wrong with her?

75
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,316
There are no
authentic portraits available...

76
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,073
so sculptors and painters
have to work from models.

77
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,549
I've never found the right one,
but I will someday.

78
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,679
It's a shame to race through this exhibit.
These figures should be studied.

79
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,070
You're very kind.
My creations have some merit, I suspect...

80
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,237
but in bringing back to life
the lovely Marie Antoinette...

81
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,197
I feel I've done my best work.

82
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,477
I've never seen anything so exquisite.

83
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,233
People say they can see
my Marie Antoinette breathe...

84
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,276
that her breast rises and falls.

85
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,239
Look at her eyes,
they follow you wherever you go.

86
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,117
She is very real to me.

87
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,796
You know, her eyes do follow you.

88
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,078
They're made of glass, more's the pity.
The exact size and color of the original.

89
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,152
They're inserted into the sockets
from inside...

90
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,869
by way of the hollow neck,
before the head is attached to the body.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,470
Forgive me, my dear,
for discussing your intimate secrets.

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,514
I'm sorry. I lose myself at times.

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,759
If people knew what you have
inside these walls...

94
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,115
you couldn't accommodate the crowds.

95
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,794
What you need here is exploitation,
more advertising.

96
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,832
- That's what I've been telling him.
- My partner wouldn't agree.

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,071
He's not happy here.
He wants to invest in something else.

98
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,709
Would you become a partner
in this venture? Would you buy him out?

99
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,590
I might be interested if my
lawyers approve and the price is right.

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,399
With your support, I'd do wonders.
I'd make any sacrifice.

101
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,155
Unfortunately, I'm leaving for Egypt.
I'm financing some excavations there.

102
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,595
I'll be back in three months,
then we can discuss...

103
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,352
You make me very happy.

104
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,916
You intrigue me, Professor.
I believe we'd get along together.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,592
- Good night.
- Good night.

106
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,035
- And I'm grateful to you...
- It's all right.

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,475
Thank you for your visit
and your encouragement.

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,073
I'll see you in three months.

109
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,752
- Good night.
- Good night.

110
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,870
Mr. Wallace is a great art critic, darling.
You heard what he said.

111
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,632
Does he make you happy?

112
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,518
Of course you'd say that.
But I don't care about success.

113
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,989
The world will acknowledge your beauty.

114
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,078
And you, my friends...

115
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,550
Cleopatra, Mark Antony,
Lincoln, Joan of Arc, all of you.

116
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,154
How would it suit you to be famous again?

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,674
I know it'll please you,
you conceited devil.

118
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,316
It was like you to get yourself shot down
in a burning barn.

119
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,198
Couldn't do it
without a spotlight, could you?

120
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,555
Do you really hear what they say?

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,429
Of course.

122
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,472
A man has to be a little nuts
to be a good showman.

123
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,516
The sooner I'm out of it, the better.

124
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,113
You'll be out soon, Matthew.

125
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,475
Mr. Wallace returns from Egypt
in three months.

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,391
He'll be ready to talk business then.

127
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,199
- I heard him. That's no good for me.
- But, surely...

128
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,034
I want to buy something. It'll pay off
in a big way and three months is too late.

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,839
What guarantee do I have
that he won't go cold on the deal?

130
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,753
- Sorry. It's the best I could do.
- I can do better.

131
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,233
How would you like
to split $25,000 with me?

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,878
And you call me crazy?

133
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,997
You ever thought of what would happen
if we had a fire here?

134
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,231
In the cellar, there are six barrels of wax.
Wax is paraffin based.

135
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,596
It's highly inflammable.
This place would go up like a paint factory.

136
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,274
Burn? Burn all my people?

137
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,515
- Do you think I'm a murderer?
- Stop dreaming.

138
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,434
These dummies are insured for $25,000.
That's $12,500 for each of us.

139
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,950
You'd have money to begin again.

140
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,713
I'd rather die myself
than see my friends destroyed.

141
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,234
I won't let you do it,
and I'll kill you if you try.

142
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,673
Don't be stupid.

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,719
All you have to do is to strike a match
and the thing is done.

144
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,195
Yes, my friend was a genius.
A great artist.

145
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,036
Only I could understand him.

146
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,314
We were like that, Cathy. Just like that.

147
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,115
- Couldn't they ever find him after the fire?
- Not a sign of him.

148
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,715
The place burned like a paint factory.
Like a volcano.

149
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,430
He was such an impractical fellow.

150
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,638
But I still loved him.

151
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,270
Had I been there, I might have saved him.

152
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,874
You might have gotten burned yourself.

153
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,552
Yes. Such is life.

154
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,952
No matter how much we lose,
we must still go on living.

155
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,749
Was there any insurance
on the Wax Museum?

156
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,159
Yes. I had a little difficulty about that.

157
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,755
According to the partnership agreement...

158
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,434
the money was to go
to the survivor of the others.

159
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,870
The insurance company
insists upon proof of my partner's death.

160
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,038
They always want a corpse.

161
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,953
But they settled finally.
This afternoon, in fact.

162
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,357
Certified check. I got it cashed.
The money is in my safe.

163
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,118
- You know what that means, baby?
- No, what?

164
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,034
That little trip
I was talking to you about...

165
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,911
You're such a card!

166
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,792
- How much did you get?
- $25,000.

167
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,709
Where would you like to go? Atlantic City?

168
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,997
Niagara Falls.
We can get the license in Buffalo.

169
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,994
- License?
- Yes. You know.

170
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,708
Legitimate.

171
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,039
Why not? It might be fun.

172
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,599
Waiter, my check.

173
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,752
Pull it tighter, Sue.

174
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,432
I want a waist like Anna Held.

175
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,956
If I pull it any tighter,
you're not going to be able to breathe.

176
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,432
That's all right.
I don't need much breath, anyway.

177
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,196
As my late friend Matty used to say:

178
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,239
"If a girl don't watch her figure,
the men won't."

179
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,831
Wasn't that the man you were to marry?

180
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,229
Yes, but he hung himself instead.

181
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,197
Matty was such a card.

182
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,755
Where is your new friend
gonna take you tonight?

183
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,389
The Hoffman House for dinner,
and then to a vaudeville show.

184
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,798
- That sounds like fun.
- He's a free spender, all right.

185
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,077
Little bit older than I like 'em,
but very distinguished looking.

186
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,355
- Is he nice?
- Awfully nice.

187
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,910
A real gentleman,
except when he has had a couple of drinks.

188
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,632
That's to be expected.

189
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,948
I'm moving up.

190
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,038
I'm moving up in the world, honey.

191
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,157
No girl ever hits the jackpot
till after she passes 14th Street.

192
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,390
- Is that how it goes?
- Sure.

193
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,029
Look at me.

194
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,759
Not too long ago,
I was down on Delancey Street.

195
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,230
And tonight I'll be right up there
among the bright lights on 23rd.

196
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,039
Now, when you get up there tonight,
don't drink too much.

197
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,838
Don't worry, I won't.

198
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,152
He keeps trying to pour the liquor into me,
but I always manage to keep my head.

199
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,596
After all, now that I'm going regular
with a swell...

200
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,991
I got social obligations.

201
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,234
You know how it is when a fella...
No, of course you don't know.

202
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,989
You're not like me. You never could be.

203
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,996
You got all the brains
and all I've got is what I've got.

204
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,070
You know, I'm surprised
you even talk to me.

205
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,469
What nonsense.
You've been so good to me.

206
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,909
Why not?

207
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,798
A girl needs a friend
when she is down on her luck.

208
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,718
Holy smoke! Look at the time.
I've got to hurry.

209
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,513
Did you find a job yet?

210
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,070
No, but they need a hat-check girl
at the Silver Slipper...

211
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,390
and I've got an appointment
with the manager.

212
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,630
I know that fellow. Watch out for him.

213
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,712
- But why? What's the matter with him?
- Nothing much.

214
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,395
- Long as you know how to duck.
- That kind?

215
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,469
Yes.

216
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,028
- Did you eat today?
- I had everything I needed.

217
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,758
To hear you tell it.

218
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,192
- Besides, you're behind in your room rent.
- Mrs. Flannigan will wait for me.

219
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,508
Don't count on that.

220
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,989
The old buzzard
almost locked me out once.

221
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,029
There.

222
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,078
If I don't sizzle him tonight,
I might as well give up.

223
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,713
He's picking me up in a hansom cab.
No trolley for him. He is real society.

224
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,159
All I've got is 50 cents.
Buy some dinner with it.

225
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,959
- No, Cathy.
- Come on.

226
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,631
My friend will give me some money
tonight and then I'll stake you.

227
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,030
I don't need any mad money.
I never get mad.

228
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,876
Good luck tonight at the Silver Slipper.
And don't forget to duck.

229
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,632
Just a moment, Miss Allen.

230
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,914
- What are you coming in so quietly for?
- I didn't want to disturb anybody.

231
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,479
- Did you get the job?
- No.

232
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,835
- Why not?
- I had trouble with the boss.

233
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,239
You'll get your money.

234
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,993
Cathy promised to lend me some tonight
when she comes home.

235
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,277
You better get right up there, then.
Because she's home now.

236
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,878
- Couldn't it wait until tomorrow?
- No, it could not.

237
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,316
If you want to sleep in this house tonight,
you get that money.

238
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,195
All right, I'll try.

239
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,115
Cathy, it's Sue. Are you there?

240
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,511
I tell you, the scream came from up there.

241
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,158
Let's look into it.

242
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,592
- Usually there's a policeman at the corner.
- That's why I'm blowing the whistle.

243
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,514
Cabbie!

244
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,355
- What is it, Mother?
- It's Sue.

245
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,158
This is a surprise.
I was just thinking about...

246
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,790
- What happened to you, dear?
- What's wrong?

247
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,235
- Wait a minute.
- What happened?

248
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,470
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

249
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,551
Cathy Gray, the girl in my rooming house,
was murdered tonight.

250
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,149
- What?
- I found her.

251
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,398
The man who killed her
was there in the room.

252
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,591
I tried to get away from him.

253
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,034
But he followed me into the street.

254
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,193
No, Scott, please don't go out there.

255
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,078
It's all right, darling. Don't be frightened.

256
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,509
It's all right now, dear. You're safe.

257
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,515
- Who found the body?
- One of my roomers. A friend of Cathy's.

258
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,750
- Sue Allen.
- Which one is Miss Allen?

259
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,150
- She isn't here.
- Where is she?

260
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,119
I don't know. We heard her scream.

261
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,270
When we went looking for her,
she was gone.

262
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,954
- Are all your roomers in?
- All but Miss Allen.

263
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,192
Lt. Brennan will want a statement
from each one of you.

264
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,350
See that nobody leaves the house.

265
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,313
When I arrived at the rooming house,
this girl had been dead for several hours.

266
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,074
The immediate cause of death
was strangulation.

267
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,714
The mark of a cord is still on her throat.

268
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,952
My examination indicated
she'd probably been given a drug.

269
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,236
- You were right.
- What was it?

270
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,757
Something to make her sleep.
Veronal, perhaps.

271
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,309
I'll know as soon as we hear
from the laboratory.

272
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,516
How long would it take
for such a drug to work?

273
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,989
That would depend upon
how much it was diluted.

274
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,469
It was probably given to her in a drink.

275
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,716
That's how it's usually done.

276
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,437
- Business is slow tonight.
- What?

277
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,910
- Three suicides and two murders...
- And a traffic case since 9:00.

278
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,150
The fellow got hit by an automobile.

279
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,993
I didn't think they go fast enough
to hurt anybody.

280
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,038
Give them time.
They're getting better every day.

281
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,672
I hope you like it here, honey.
It's the best we've got.

282
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,519
- What's the matter with this one?
- You'll get used to that.

283
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,034
The embalming fluid makes them jump.

284
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,391
One of the suicides. Just like a woman.

285
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,074
They always have to have the last word.

286
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,549
- Why didn't you tell the police?
- She's doing that.

287
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,153
Last night was the time to do it.

288
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,835
- She was in no condition to come here.
- This is murder, Mrs. Andrews.

289
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,593
The body of Cathy Gray
was stolen from the morgue last night.

290
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,715
No.

291
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,190
Why would anyone
want to take Cathy's body?

292
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,475
We are as much in the dark as you are.

293
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,030
We had a similar case before.
Matthew Burke.

294
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,189
I read about that.

295
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,714
And Patterson,
a Deputy City Attorney disappeared.

296
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,472
We found no trace of him.

297
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,430
We could've laid our hands
on that man that you saw last night.

298
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,913
That's the strangest description
I've ever heard.

299
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,557
- No human being can look like that.
- Sure you didn't imagine it?

300
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,995
I did see him.
Just as I described him to you.

301
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,911
He was incredible, but very real.

302
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,309
Could he be the man
who took Miss Gray to dinner?

303
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,628
That's impossible.

304
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,553
She told me
that he was very good-looking.

305
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,279
That's what the landlady said,
it's a man with gray hair.

306
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,477
We have no suspects
fitting your description.

307
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,596
If we did,
we'd have him in the crazy house.

308
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,194
Don't leave town. Where can we find you?

309
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,918
27 Lafayette Street.

310
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,754
- Miss Allen will stay in our home.
- Make sure of that. She's our only witness.

311
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,478
That's all. Thank you.

312
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,599
How do you do?

313
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,150
I received a letter giving this address
and signed Professor Jarrod.

314
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,994
But I know the Professor's dead.
Can you tell me who wrote this letter?

315
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,236
My name is Sidney Wallace.

316
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,113
It's so good...

317
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,435
Forgive me. Shaking hands with me
is an unpleasant experience.

318
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,478
My hands are no longer hands.
Sit down, please.

319
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,910
This is Igor. He's a deaf-mute.
He is one of my assistants.

320
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,915
I'm going to open another wax museum
under a different name.

321
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,469
- It startled you, seeing me here?
- I thought you were dead.

322
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,676
Jarrod is dead. I am a reincarnation.

323
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,718
When I saw your signature,
I thought somebody was fooling me.

324
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,836
I don't understand
how you escaped the fire.

325
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,672
It's a mystery to me, too.

326
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,433
All I can remember is
that I tried to get out of my studio.

327
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,956
- I failed at first, but here I am.
- What a frightful experience.

328
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,793
Somehow I made my way
to the house of a doctor.

329
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,436
I still have my limbs but
they won't bear the weight of my body.

330
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,151
As for my hands,
they are no use to me now.

331
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,119
As a sculptor, I can't control them.
But they serve for ordinary functions.

332
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,155
- But you're beginning again?
- With the help of my pupils, yes.

333
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,352
I'm rebuilding my exhibition
from the ground up.

334
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,635
I'm going to give the people
what they want:

335
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,836
Sensation, horror, shock.

336
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,548
Send them out in the streets
to tell their friends...

337
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,074
how wonderful it is to be scared to death.

338
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,196
I'll show you one of my subjects.

339
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,039
Do you recall the case of Kemmler,
the first man to die in the electric chair?

340
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,556
- Yes.
- Igor is working on a model of his head.

341
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,234
He has a strange obsession,
this mute of mine.

342
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,996
Every head he models
takes on the shape of his own face.

343
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,399
But in this case I humor him,
for he somewhat resembles Kemmler.

344
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,518
Crimes of violence
will be reproduced in wax...

345
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,797
and exhibited while they are still fresh
in the public mind.

346
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,991
What do you think of my scheme?

347
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,389
It will succeed, commercially,
though it doesn't sound like you.

348
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,394
- Have you turned your back on beauty?
- No.

349
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,436
But I can no longer create it.

350
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,957
- I never forgot your Marie Antoinette.
- Nor have I.

351
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,638
She will be the leading lady
of my new exhibition.

352
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,392
But I must find her first.

353
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,391
- Find her?
- A model, I mean.

354
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,316
Yes, there will be beauty,
for contrast, if nothing else.

355
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,074
But each subject must be taken from life.

356
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,439
How can I convince my audience
they're alive, if I don't believe it myself?

357
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,915
I have something I think will interest you.

358
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,029
You follow Igor down into the basement.

359
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,837
I have to go my own way.

360
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,914
Here we are. Interesting, isn't it?

361
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,995
One of my pupils is about to dip a body
into a bath of wax.

362
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,195
- Body?
- Yes.

363
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,271
The bodies are constructed separately...

364
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,750
to exact specifications,
of reinforced plaster of Paris.

365
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,035
This is Leon, another one of my pupils.

366
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,838
- Mr. Wallace.
- How do you do?

367
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,515
The wax is melted in the cauldron
you see above the vat...

368
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,114
liquefied and brought to a boiling point...

369
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,431
so that it will distribute itself
evenly over the body.

370
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,353
The head and hands,
tinted by my own secret process...

371
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,955
are attached to the body
after it is covered with its skin of wax.

372
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,314
Now watch.

373
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,159
I wondered how it was done.

374
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,038
It's a method of my own.
Crude but adequate.

375
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,754
- Have you found a home for your museum?
- This is it, the building upstairs.

376
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,356
We'll continue to use the cellar
as the workshop...

377
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,274
it's an excellent location, and the building
can be leased at the right price.

378
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,796
I have some capital, but I need more.
$30,000, at least.

379
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,430
That's why I've asked you to come here.

380
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,792
- I'll think it over.
- Good.

381
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,798
She is about right, now.

382
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,758
Leon, drain out the surplus,
and let her cool.

383
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,277
Leon, open up number 27.

384
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,393
Come this way, please.

385
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,590
I told you that I intend to exhibit
scenes of violence.

386
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,796
Here is an interesting subject.

387
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,110
A mystery they are still talking about.

388
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,759
All right, Leon.

389
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,638
I saw his picture in the papers.
This is a remarkable likeness.

390
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,598
- But it can't be a death mask.
- No, it's from memory.

391
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,395
He hanged himself in an elevator shaft.

392
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,431
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
See the House of Wax.

393
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,832
See the Chamber of Horrors.

394
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,714
Here's three lovely ladies right over here.

395
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,118
Would you like to see Little Egypt?

396
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,636
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen,
Little Egypt, Queen of the Harem...

397
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,395
who danced at the Colombian Exposition
in Chicago in 1893.

398
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,472
Is she wax, or is she flesh and blood?

399
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,154
See the world in wax, the Hall of Fame.

400
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,514
The Chamber Of Horrors.

401
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,910
A cultural exhibition
that'll enlighten you, amaze you...

402
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,309
- I think I could do that.
- No, you couldn't.

403
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,789
I could, too, if I took my stays off.

404
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,992
Don't do that. Don't talk that way.

405
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,559
Watch it, young lady.

406
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,552
Careful, sir. Keep your head down
or I'll tap you on the chin.

407
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,675
Look out.

408
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,997
That's a becoming hat you're wearing.

409
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,959
I wonder if I could clip a flower off it.
Hold steady, now. Don't move your head.

410
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,315
Or you'll lose the powder off your nose.

411
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,550
There is someone with a bag of popcorn.

412
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,835
Close your mouth,
it's the bag I'm aiming at.

413
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,876
Not your tonsil. Here she comes.

414
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,071
Look at that, it's in the bag.

415
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,797
See the lovely centers of ancient times,
ladies and gentlemen.

416
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,713
Beauties who died and tortured
out on the block.

417
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,358
Visit our Chamber of Horrors.

418
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,113
And pass the time of day
with notorious murderers...

419
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,158
who killed with the rope,
the knife, and the axe.

420
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,757
Thrills, chills, a lot of dirt
for a price within the reach of all.

421
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,674
I hope you don't think I've gone too far
hiring this fellow to bring people in.

422
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,672
- He makes it sound like a sideshow.
- Try him for a week or two.

423
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,876
Once we're established,
we won't need that sort of thing.

424
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,912
He looks like a real man.

425
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,353
You'd be surprised.

426
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,317
It's a real man. Sorry.

427
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,556
The historic figures I'm about to show you
will be more interesting...

428
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,474
when I tell you that their faces were
molded from the original death masks...

429
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,472
now in the possession
of certain European governments.

430
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,397
First, we have Anne Boleyn...

431
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,631
second wife of Henry the Vlll,
and the mother of Queen Elizabeth.

432
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,553
With the executioner
Henry borrowed from the French king...

433
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,474
so that Anne's head would be cleaved
from her body without too much pain.

434
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,636
He was a thoughtful husband, Henry.

435
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,473
It was he who invented
the short cut to divorce.

436
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,837
A very bad pun, I'm afraid.

437
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,748
Here is another scene of historic violence.

438
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,912
Charlotte Corday and Marat...

439
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,150
one of the leaders
of the French Revolution.

440
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,358
The lady found him taking a bath,
and plunged the knife into his heart.

441
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,510
<i>- Quelle femme terrible!
- What a shocking thing.</i>

442
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,751
Yes, wasn't it? The poor man
was dreadfully embarrassed.

443
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,356
The exhibits in this room
will be added to...

444
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,113
from time to time
as various crimes are committed.

445
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,350
You'll read about them
in your newspaper...

446
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,159
and see them enacted here
in waxen tableaux.

447
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,509
By the way, ladies...

448
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,354
this is how your ancestor
carried his bride across the threshold.

449
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,393
During the French Revolution...

450
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,392
a certain doctor invented
a labor-saving device...

451
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,710
to take the place of a headmen's ax.

452
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,951
So successful was this machine...

453
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,508
at cutting off the heads
of the French aristocrats...

454
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,431
they named it after its creator.

455
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,715
Here it is, the bloody guillotine.

456
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,391
I don't think I can stand it.

457
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,119
Pull yourself together.

458
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,988
Twelve years ago, the electric chair
was first used in New York state.

459
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,390
Here we have an authentic reproduction...

460
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,678
of the execution of William Kemmler
on August 3, in 1890.

461
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,791
Kemmler killed without mercy
and 2,000 volts sent him to a higher court.

462
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,512
The torture of the rack. In this case...

463
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,718
Lady Anne Askew, an English noblewoman
accused of treason...

464
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,593
is being put to the question.

465
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,433
Needless to say,
she admitted she was a traitor.

466
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,875
Who wouldn't,
under that sort of pressure?

467
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,914
- Is it your corset?
- It's my stomach. It turned over.

468
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,319
Mine turned over, too.

469
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,594
Now, my friends...

470
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,151
we have that jolly old gentleman
known as the modern Bluebeard.

471
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,556
Like his namesake,
he killed not wisely, but too well...

472
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,551
and did away with eight wives.

473
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,316
- Smelling salts, ladies? Help yourself.
- Thank you very much.

474
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,597
Next door to him, we have a mystery
of more recent date.

475
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,916
Matthew Burke, the stockbroker.

476
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,712
He was found hanged in the elevator shaft
of the building where he had his offices.

477
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,714
Was it murder or suicide?

478
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,718
Only time will tell.

479
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,355
"Foul deeds will rise, though all the world
o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."

480
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,189
Thank you.

481
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,914
- You like him?
- He looks exactly like my Uncle Rufus.

482
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,753
They ought to have a policeman like this
in the Eden Musée.

483
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,796
- Haven't you been there?
- No.

484
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,713
From what I see in the papers,
this museum is even better.

485
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,233
We'll soon find out.

486
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,749
Meet my good friend, Mr. Sidney Wallace.

487
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,273
- Miss Sue Allen.
- A pleasure.

488
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,954
- I heard you were in town.
- You should have looked me up.

489
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,430
I expect great things of Scott.
He's one of our most promising sculptors.

490
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,034
- Has he been working hard?
- He never knows when to stop.

491
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,714
- Sue's been posing for me.
- Indeed, lovely subject.

492
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,836
She's not a professional model.
She's a guest.

493
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,399
Our mothers were great friends.

494
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,755
- Have you been inside?
- Is it exciting?

495
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,434
If anything, too much so.
But I'm sure it'll catch on.

496
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,550
Jarrod, the owner,
is a good friend of mine.

497
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,393
You'll be interested in him.
Let's go in, shall we?

498
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,591
- These figures are excellent.
- I thought you'd agree with me.

499
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,274
They're not only well done
but they're good theater.

500
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,828
- What do you think?
- I know they are only wax...

501
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,037
but they seem so real,
just looking at her makes my neck hurt.

502
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,156
Wait till you see the Chamber of Horrors.

503
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,993
I told Jarrod he should have
a nurse on duty there.

504
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,355
He lost the use of his hands.

505
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,512
- Who did these figures?
- His pupils, but he supervised the work.

506
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,273
- His is the mastermind.
- Surely knows his anatomy.

507
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,713
Sue, what is it?

508
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,070
- Are you crying?
- What's wrong, Miss Allen?

509
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,879
A dear friend of mine was murdered
and I found her.

510
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,396
She means Cathy Gray, the girl
whose body was stolen from the morgue.

511
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,357
What made you think of her now?

512
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,599
That's her face. I know every line of it.

513
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,638
I wake up at night and I see it.
I can't get it out of my mind.

514
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,188
Perhaps that's the reason
you see a resemblance.

515
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,919
- It's more than a resemblance.
- It's wax, my dear.

516
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,319
I know, but...

517
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,715
But why should it be so like Cathy?

518
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,632
I think I can explain that.

519
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,910
- This is a pleasure.
- You see, Miss Allen...

520
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,195
I heard what the young lady said.

521
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,909
The figure of Joan of Arc
is a traditional exhibit in wax museums.

522
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,833
It was completed just in time
for our opening tonight.

523
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,071
You're right, my dear.
It is more than a chance resemblance.

524
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,756
When I create an important figure,
I can't take just any face.

525
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,639
I saw pictures of your Cathy Gray
in the newspaper.

526
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,632
Her face fascinated me. And here she is.

527
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,918
Immortalized as the victim
of an earlier event.

528
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,239
- Do you really think she'd mind?
- No, I don't think she'd mind.

529
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,118
Cathy loved to "dress up" as she called it.
She used to take fancy dresses...

530
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,913
and imitate the actresses
she saw in the theater.

531
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,555
- I don't think she'd mind.
- Then I'm forgiven?

532
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,517
There's nothing to forgive.

533
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,954
I just don't understand
how it can seem so real.

534
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,635
That's the finest compliment
I have ever received. Thank you, my dear.

535
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,110
Did I hear your name correctly,
Scott Andrews?

536
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,351
- Yes, Mr. Jarrod.
- The sculptor I've been telling you about.

537
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,790
Sidney showed me
photographs of your work.

538
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,518
He was right. You have great promise.

539
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,637
- What are you doing now?
- I'm doing a head of Miss Allen.

540
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,478
Let me see your hands.

541
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,351
Mine were once like that.

542
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,834
How I envy you.

543
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,473
Would you be interested in some modeling
for me, some originals I have in mind?

544
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,879
Yes. I'd be honored.

545
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,997
Good. Come here tomorrow morning,
we'll make the arrangements.

546
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,718
I think you'll like it.

547
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,557
I want you to look at this girl.

548
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,074
- With pleasure.
- Who does she remind you of?

549
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,957
I've been wondering about that.

550
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,871
I haven't known her
more than 10 minutes...

551
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,632
but there's something about her face...

552
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,190
That haunts you as the face
of my Marie Antoinette has haunted me.

553
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,475
Of course. I should have seen it at once.

554
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,996
A figure in wax.
Mr. Jarrod's greatest work.

555
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,150
More than wax. She lived.

556
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,832
- You mean I look like she did?
- Exactly as she did.

557
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,391
Once in his lifetime,
every artist feels the hand of God...

558
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,914
and creates something that comes alive.

559
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,312
So it was with my Marie Antoinette.
And I loved her.

560
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,157
But she is gone now. Horribly destroyed.

561
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,714
Perhaps you would help me
to bring her back.

562
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,309
You will come to see me? Soon?

563
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,634
I'd be glad to.

564
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,517
You'll be welcome at any time,
no matter what I'm doing.

565
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,879
- And you, Mr. Andrews, in the morning...
- I'll be here, very eager to begin.

566
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,158
It has been a very exciting day for me
and I'm a little tired.

567
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,629
So if you'll forgive me, I'll say good night.

568
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,191
Sidney, one moment, please.

569
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,755
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

570
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,228
Forget about it.
You heard what Mr. Jarrod said.

571
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,312
Cathy's face was inspiration.
It's a portrait in wax.

572
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,152
Why should it seem so real?

573
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,157
I hate to drag you away.

574
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,391
That's fine. I'm going to work here.
We'll see it all another time.

575
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,913
Yes, another time.

576
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,752
Still time to see the entire exhibition,
ladies and gentlemen.

577
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,799
Get your tickets from the fine little lady
in the box office and go right in.

578
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,115
See the world in wax
and improve your mind.

579
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,795
See the Chamber of Horrors
and scare yourself out of a year's growth.

580
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,993
Not again.

581
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,231
What happened? Why did you scream?

582
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,639
I saw Cathy again.

583
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,792
And the man who killed her
was right here in this room.

584
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,511
I must have been dreaming.

585
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,598
Of course you were, dear.

586
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,438
A lager for the gentleman.

587
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,279
Sarsaparilla for the lady.

588
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,033
- And two knockwurst on rye.
- Thank you.

589
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,750
- Enjoying yourself?
- It's exciting.

590
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,273
- Do nice people come here?
- Of course.

591
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,158
- These Sunday matinees are very popular.
- I don't know.

592
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,438
It doesn't seem proper,
all those girls showing their talents.

593
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,513
You never saw a show
like this in Provincetown?

594
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,472
Don't worry, your reputation is safe.
You've been worrying too much...

595
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,552
about wax figures
and seeing monsters in your dreams.

596
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,235
You need something like this
to bring you back to normalcy.

597
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,595
Prosit!

598
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,156
Remember Mr. Jarrod said he first saw
Cathy's picture in the newspaper.

599
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,992
Yes. What's wrong with that?

600
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,519
I knew her so well.

601
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,554
I knew every little expression
and they are all there.

602
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,710
They would be. The man's an artist.

603
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,397
There's something else I saw
that night in the museum.

604
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,916
Cathy had a habit
of wearing an earring in her right ear.

605
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,436
She had the lobe of her right ear only
pierced for that.

606
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,109
But that's there, too.
How could he see that in a photograph?

607
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,276
- How can he make it so real unless...
- What?

608
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,838
Unless it is Cathy.

609
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,953
I'm going to take you
to Lt. Brennan's office tomorrow.

610
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,715
Tell him exactly what you told me here.
He's a policeman, he knows.

611
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,031
He'll convince you once and for all
that no such thing could happen.

612
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,554
Now relax, honey, and enjoy the show.

613
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,595
I know it sounds fantastic,
but you asked me to tell you everything.

614
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,389
You can see this idea is an obsession,
an unhealthy one, if you ask me.

615
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,313
- You say Jarrod is a cripple?
- He uses a wheelchair.

616
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,194
He can walk with crutches,
but not very well.

617
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,836
Such a man came and asked to see
police photographs of Cathy Gray.

618
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,799
That's how it's done. Every detail
is studied to make the features true to life.

619
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,394
But why should Joan of Arc
have her right ear pierced?

620
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,278
- Why not? They wore them then.
- Two, not one.

621
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,559
Lieutenant, it's not a suspicion.
It's more a kind of fear, an intuition.

622
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,269
Intuition isn't much help in police work.
Facts are what we need.

623
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,557
Suppose you forget about it,
and let us do the worrying.

624
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,437
You mean you'll investigate it?

625
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,715
- Of course he does.
- Yes, that's what I mean.

626
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,837
- You both think I'm crazy.
- We think nothing of the kind.

627
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,390
It was very good of you to listen
and be so patient. Thank you.

628
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,233
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

629
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,629
Thanks.

630
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,189
This is Brennan speaking. Give me Shane.

631
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,194
Hello. I want you to go
to the City License Bureau...

632
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,748
and check up
on a man named Henry Jarrod.

633
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,150
Yes, he opened a museum
on 29th Street, near Broadway.

634
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,152
Yes, The House of Wax.

635
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,155
Dig up all you can. Get a list
of his employees and check with me here.

636
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,951
That's a copy of her face, all right.

637
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,429
But she didn't look like that
when I saw her.

638
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,034
- Not so composed.
- Poor kid.

639
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,111
You know, this fellow Jarrod's good.

640
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,670
- You think Miss Allen's fears are justified?
- Heck, no. Do you?

641
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,275
That's wax, how could it be anything else?

642
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,318
Leave it to a skirt
to dream up a crazy idea like that.

643
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,592
So you did come to see me,
my Marie Antoinette?

644
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,477
Or was it that you came to see?

645
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,678
Mr. Jarrod, I'm so sorry. I know
I'm not supposed to touch the figures.

646
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,354
You couldn't help yourself.
Don't let it trouble you.

647
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,159
I beg your pardon,
this is Leon Averill and Igor.

648
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,949
- How do you do?
- Igor isn't impolite. He simply can't talk.

649
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,231
Leon is an artist in his own right.

650
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,596
It was he who did the waxwork
on the figure of Joan of Arc.

651
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,717
- Does she still seem real to you?
- As life itself.

652
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,875
Of course, her hair is different,
but that doesn't change her face.

653
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,709
What puzzles me is
how you can get such detail from a photo.

654
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,511
Was Cathy wearing her earrings
when the police photographed her?

655
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,478
Earrings? I don't remember.
Was she, Leon?

656
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,710
No. I don't think so.

657
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,832
The police would remove the jewelry
from the body, wouldn't they?

658
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,754
Yet you were careful to show that
both her ears had been pierced for them.

659
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,553
Yes, of course.

660
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,428
If I missed a detail of that sort,
Mr. Jarrod would be most displeased.

661
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,317
He insists on reality.

662
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,153
I can understand that.

663
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,838
Just a moment, Leon.

664
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,754
There's something in this box
I think would interest you. Open it, Leon.

665
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,668
Your Mr. Andrews permitted us
to make a cast of the head he did of you.

666
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,036
Leon has just finished it in wax.
Do you like it?

667
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,597
It's sort of a shock
to see your head detached that way.

668
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,398
- I guess it's a very good likeness.
- Yes, and no.

669
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,473
Andrews is clever,
but like all modern sculptors...

670
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,836
he has too much imagination.
He would improve on nature.

671
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,639
What I need for my Marie Antoinette
is you.

672
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,028
The real you.

673
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,277
Nothing less will satisfy me.

674
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,594
Will you come to see me again, my dear?

675
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,396
You know this fellow Jarrod's
quicker at finding these guys than we are?

676
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,074
That's what he says in his advertising.

677
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,669
Look at that. Even the twist in the neck.

678
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,639
That's a case that gets me.
Where is Burke? Who got him?

679
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,439
- Who'd want him?
- We better find out pretty quick.

680
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,512
<i>- Did you read the blast in today's World?
- Yeah, it's dynamite.</i>

681
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,670
The Chief had me in his office
this morning.

682
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,797
If I'm not careful,
I'll be pounding a beat in the Bronx.

683
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,279
Come here, Jim.

684
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,872
Do you remember Patterson, the
Deputy City Attorney who disappeared?

685
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,029
Sure.

686
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,839
Does Booth look like Wilbur,
or am I crazy?

687
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,714
He does a tad with the brush off his lip.

688
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,396
The hair is different, of course,
but the features are like Patterson's.

689
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,359
Maybe he looked like Booth. I've seen
dummies that look like people I know.

690
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,314
The caveman is a spitting image
of the new Commissioner.

691
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,198
Please. Don't touch the exhibits.

692
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,430
- Can't you read the sign?
- I'm sorry.

693
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,830
Look, where'd you get the face
for this guy that shot Lincoln?

694
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,993
- From photographs.
- They take them at that time?

695
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,439
If you go to the City Library...

696
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,115
you'll find the volume of Mathew Brady's
photos taken during the Civil War.

697
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,872
- Do you work here?
- Yeah.

698
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,156
- You make these things?
- Some of them.

699
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,753
What's your name?

700
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,270
Leon Averill. What's yours?

701
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,148
Jim Shane. I'm an engineer on the
9th Avenue El. It was nice meeting you.

702
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,236
You know me. I'm no good at names,
but I don't forget faces.

703
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,597
If I can take the muff off of that one
I might be able to place it.

704
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,193
It was a long time ago.

705
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,913
Mr. Wallace, I'm Lt. Brennan. Sgt. Shane.

706
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,309
- Glad to know you.
- Won't you sit down?

707
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,391
- Sorry I kept you waiting.
- That's all right.

708
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,756
This is the first time I've been
asked to come to Police Headquarters.

709
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,955
What am I suspected of?

710
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,032
Nothing. We thought perhaps
you might be able to help us.

711
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,793
We heard that your partner
is the same Professor Jarrod...

712
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,792
whose museum on 24th Street
burned down some time ago.

713
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,029
That's true.

714
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,919
This Professor Jarrod was
supposed to have been killed in the fire.

715
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,151
- Apparently, a slight mistake.
- You suspect him of some criminal act?

716
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,310
- We haven't a thing on him.
- We're curious.

717
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,277
So is the insurance company.

718
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,792
What do you know about his employees?

719
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,759
- There's Scott Andrews, a protégé of mine.
- Yes, we know of him.

720
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,232
Then there's Igor, deaf-mute,
and Leon Averill, who does the wax work.

721
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,279
Averill's an odd character.
Periodical drunkard, but a fine artist.

722
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,796
I've seen some of his sketches.
One of the Savior with his disciples.

723
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,233
Beautiful work.

724
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,353
- I'm afraid I haven't been much help.
- You never can tell. Thank you.

725
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,478
- Please don't mention this to your partner.
- I won't.

726
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,953
You know, I gamble on Jarrod.

727
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,077
He's strange, unpredictable,
but I think he's a man of integrity.

728
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,914
- I'm sure of it. Thank you very much.
- Not at all. Good day, gentlemen.

729
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,274
Remember I told you
I knew the man with the whiskers?

730
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,194
Do you remember that artist in Sing Sing
who painted The Last Supper on his cell?

731
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,272
Hendricks. They called him a genius
and gave him a parole.

732
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,794
But when they turned him loose,
he became a drunk.

733
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:29,031
He broke parole a year ago.
We've had him on the wanted list since.

734
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,793
- Carl Hendricks?
- That's him. Alias, Leon Averill.

735
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,677
- Bring him in.
- Can do.

736
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,909
A little more bitterness
in that face, my boy.

737
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,639
Remember, this fellow has been
badly used by the world...

738
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,188
and he despises all the people in it.

739
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,397
Deepen those lines
around the corner of the mouth.

740
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,318
Not too much.

741
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,511
There. That's better.

742
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,794
What I wouldn't give
to have those fingers of yours.

743
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,078
- Thank you, Mr. Jarrod.
- I'm sorry I kept you so late tonight, Scott.

744
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,112
That's all right.
Miss Allen is meeting me here.

745
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,993
It's her birthday.
We're going to celebrate at Chiles'.

746
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,638
Charming creature.

747
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,679
I was worried. The shock of finding
that murdered girl gave her strange ideas.

748
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,749
I know.

749
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,832
I took her to Lt. Brennan, he set her right.

750
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,150
That's very good now. Excellent.

751
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,397
Before you go, would you mind
running over to Metzgers for me?

752
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,233
- Metzgers?
- Where they make the artificial flowers.

753
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,116
They're doing a background
for this new group. Take a look at it.

754
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,078
You know what I want.
Advise them on the color scheme.

755
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,835
I'd go myself,
but it's so hard for me to get about.

756
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,559
I know. I'll be glad to do it.
I'll go right now.

757
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,232
Thank you very much.

758
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,756
I followed him through his bender.

759
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,629
Sometimes, he gets the shakes so bad,
you expect to see his teeth fall off.

760
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,358
- Is this all he had on him?
- Yes.

761
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,555
No money?

762
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,394
Gold.

763
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,278
"To Wilbur Patterson...

764
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,831
"With affection and admiration.

765
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,957
"City Attorney's Office.
December 25, 1900."

766
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,632
Where did you get this?

767
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,798
- I found it.
- Where?

768
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,513
- On the El.
- What line?

769
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,356
- Third Avenue, downtown.
- When?

770
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,829
I don't remember, it was months ago.

771
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,829
- Book him on suspicion of murder.
- No. I found that.

772
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,434
I never knew the man who owned it.
I never saw him.

773
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,589
Lock him up.

774
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,956
Please don't put me in a cell. I'm sick.

775
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,635
Can't you see my nerves are all shattered?

776
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,635
Look, please give me one little...

777
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,353
Can I have one little drink...

778
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,479
You're not going to get anything
until you tell us where you got this watch.

779
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,792
- Take him out.
- Let's go.

780
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,794
You shouldn't have done that, my dear.

781
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,639
It is Cathy.

782
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,431
It's Cathy's body under the wax.

783
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,189
I knew it. I knew it all the time.

784
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,277
Everything I ever loved
has been taken away from me.

785
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,269
Not you, my Marie Antoinette,
for I will give you eternal life.

786
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,749
This is where I recreated my Joan of Arc.
It's an interesting process.

787
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,469
If you have patience with me, my dear,
I'll show you how it's done.

788
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,158
I can't stand it.

789
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,994
All right.

790
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,195
All right, I'll tell you what I know.

791
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,075
Patterson was killed
because he looked like Booth.

792
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,754
- You killed him.
- No, not I. Jarrod, at the waxworks.

793
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,799
His hands were no good.
He had to take subjects from life.

794
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,155
- You helped him?
- No, they were already dead.

795
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,639
What about Burke?

796
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,150
He's there, too. In wax.

797
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,434
He was the one
who set fire to the old museum.

798
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,831
Jarrod came out of it alive, but insane.

799
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,356
- Cathy Gray?
- Joan of Arc. That's Cathy.

800
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,077
She's there with all the rest of them.
The whole place is a morgue.

801
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,038
He'll do the same to Sue Allen,
if he gets his hands on her.

802
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,590
You've got to stop him
before he does any more killing.

803
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,713
That look of horror spoils your lovely face.

804
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,314
What if it should show,
even through the wax?

805
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,713
Are you in there?

806
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,959
Where's Sue?

807
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,352
Where is she?

808
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,475
The end will come quickly, my love.

809
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,028
There's a pain beyond pain,
an agony so intense...

810
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,634
it shocks the mind into instant oblivion.

811
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,076
We'll find immortality together...

812
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,594
for they'll remember me through you.

813
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,950
Where's Jarrod?

814
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,874
Andrews, where's Jarrod?

815
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,393
In the cellar. He's got Sue.

816
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,872
Take care of him.

817
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,830
The People's Exhibit Number One.

818
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,516
You almost lost your head. Would you
care to keep that one as a spare?

819
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,953
No, thank you.

820
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,271
We'll never forget you and your men.
Thanks to you, we're still alive.

821
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,909
But every time I shave,
I can still feel that guillotine blade.

822
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,037
- Please, let's not talk about it anymore.
- Yes, you're right.

823
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,878
Mr. Brennan, thank you
for the use of your coat.

824
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,555
- That was nothing.
- It meant a lot to me.

825
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,473
When I found
you weren't dressed too warmly...

826
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,916
I didn't want you to catch a cold.

827
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,632
Goodbye, Mr. Brennan,
and thanks for everything.

828
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,834
- Bless you, Mr. Shane.
- Thank you, Miss Allen.

829
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,439
By the time this guy
gets out of Sing Sing...

830
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,395
this head will grow a long beard.
