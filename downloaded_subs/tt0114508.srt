1
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,446
I'm sorry.

2
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,865
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

3
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,420
Sir, she's breaking out!

4
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:49,954
What are we looking for?

5
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,799
She jumped over the fence!

6
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:18,919
A couple of trains came through here
about the time she escaped.

7
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:22,339
Do you think she could have
gotten this far in that time?

8
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:24,049
Is she that fast?

9
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:26,134
She is that fast.

10
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,180
And this too.

11
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:15,351
- $3. 10.
- Three dollars and ten cents?

12
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:21,023
- Your change.
- Thank you.

13
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,900
Can I help you?

14
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:26,320
The total is $ 17.95.

15
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,826
Here's your card.

16
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,664
Are you gonna buy those?

17
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:51,013
Have a nice trip.

18
00:09:56,643 --> 00:10:01,231
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?

19
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,902
- Sir, it's not here.
- The porter said he put it on the cart.

20
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,112
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.

21
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:32,805
<i>Government authorities said it was
the largest earthquake to strike...</i>

22
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,890
<i>He's riding Greased Lightning.</i>

23
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:37,392
<i>That was Shorty Kincaid.</i>

24
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:42,357
Enjoy the view.

25
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:14,973
Excuse me.

26
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:31,739
<i>We shouldn't be seen together.</i>

27
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,493
<i>Father hasn't been dead long.
Do you think Arlen suspects?</i>

28
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:38,872
<i>No. It's not too soon
for us to be together.</i>

29
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,501
Tickets.

30
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,381
Are you traveling by yourself?

31
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,049
You're 12?

32
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,721
Someone meeting you
in Los Angeles?

33
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,558
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.

34
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,040
Our little girl did this?

35
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,666
She's not a little girl.

36
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,629
DNA typing and material found in
those wounds proves it was her.

37
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,800
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.

38
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,301
We should stop the trains.

39
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,347
And have the railroad and police
ask questions we can't answer?

40
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:40,519
We'll put key personnel at
every stop along these lines.

41
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,979
I want a team to track her.

42
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,439
Hunt her down.

43
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,276
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.

44
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:53,031
- Thanks for taking care of my cat.
- We'll take good care of him.

45
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:54,991
I won't be gone very long.

46
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,785
Take care.

47
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,412
Bye-bye.

48
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:02,457
Are you still having problems
with the people at work?

49
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,626
They point their finger
at me saying...

50
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:09,047
<i>...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.</i>

51
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,466
Why? Because I have feelings?

52
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,135
Because I feel?

53
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,140
There's someone at the door.

54
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:23,395
I won't answer that. Whoever it is
can come back at the end of the hour.

55
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,647
That's for me.

56
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:30,152
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.

57
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,237
I know.

58
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,031
Gotta go.

59
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:41,703
Mr. Fitch will be with you all
in just a moment.

60
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:49,878
Well...

61
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,798
I guess we all must be here
for the same reason...

62
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:55,383
...whatever that is.

63
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,093
<i>I'm Dan Smithson...</i>

64
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,264
<i>...and I don't know why
I'm here either.</i>

65
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:05,894
But they said they needed me and
it was important, so I came.

66
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,146
What do you do, Dan?

67
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:11,816
I'm an empath.

68
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:17,864
Sometimes they show me awful things
people have done.

69
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,493
I try to tell them why they did it.

70
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,828
What qualifies you for that?

71
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:26,664
I feel things deeply, that's all.

72
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,753
What am I feeling now?

73
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:39,011
You wanna believe that
nothing affects you...

74
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,182
<i>...that you're not afraid of anything.</i>

75
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,935
<i>But you're curious...</i>

76
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:48,938
...just like the rest of us.

77
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:53,901
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.

78
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,861
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.

79
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,948
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.

80
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:03,202
And who are you,
and what do you do?

81
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:05,538
Preston Lennox.

82
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:07,957
<i>And if I'm here...</i>

83
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:10,459
...the shit has hit the fan.

84
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:13,879
What exactly is your area
of specialty, Mr. Lennox?

85
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm a freelance solution to
our government's problems.

86
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:21,137
What exactly might they be?

87
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:25,891
The kind people don't usually
like to talk about.

88
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,728
You hunt people, don't you?

89
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:36,945
I guess so.

90
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:49,416
You in here? It's a little late for Tv.

91
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,422
You in here, honey?

92
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:50,228
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.

93
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,313
I'm in charge of this operation.

94
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,649
Would you sit a little closer, please?

95
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:07,078
In November of 1974...

96
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:10,039
...a small group from S.E.T. I...

97
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,334
...S- E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...

98
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,878
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...

99
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,131
...to send a message to whoever
was listening.

100
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:21,050
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...

101
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,886
...including structure
of human DNA...

102
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:26,180
...a map of our solar system...

103
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:29,518
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.

104
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:36,358
In January of 1993, Arecibo
received a message back...

105
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:38,819
...from an extra terrestrial...

106
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:40,612
...unknown source.

107
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,030
That's great.

108
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,700
Intelligent life beyond this planet?

109
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,118
Yes.

110
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:48,871
There were two communications.

111
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,625
The first message turned out to be
a superior catalyst for methane.

112
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,127
We now have the potential...

113
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:58,547
...to produce infinite energy
from this clean-burning fuel.

114
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,718
This convinced us we were dealing
with a friendly intelligence.

115
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:07,389
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA...

116
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,851
...with friendly instructions
on how to combine it with ours.

117
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,063
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.

118
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,398
Basically...

119
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:20,068
...the new combined
DNA sequence...

120
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,529
...was injected into 100...

121
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,032
...human ova.

122
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,370
We got 7...

123
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:30,747
...to divide.

124
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,540
Four petered out.

125
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:35,084
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.

126
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,754
And we allowed one to grow.

127
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,757
Its code name is "Sil."

128
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,760
That's after 2 hours.

129
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:46,471
One day.

130
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:49,265
Two days.

131
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,935
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

132
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:53,603
A week.

133
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:56,439
- It's a girl.
- Yes.

134
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,444
We decided to make it female
so it would be more docile...

135
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,656
...and controllable.
- More docile and controllable, huh?

136
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,034
Well, I guess you guys
don't get out much.

137
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:12,831
That's her 1 month
after she was born.

138
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:16,000
So you kept her caged in there?

139
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,628
It was safer to keep her isolated.

140
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,964
She didn't like being locked up.

141
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:22,966
She didn't like being alone.

142
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,717
Didn't she?

143
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:31,892
She's hiding something.
Something inside.

144
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:33,978
You're right, Dan.

145
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:38,399
This is three months after
she was born. Watch carefully.

146
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:42,236
What the hell was that?

147
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:43,904
Back the tape up.

148
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:48,742
Watch her eyes.

149
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:51,745
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.

150
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,335
- She's having horrible nightmares.
- It's some kind of anxiety reaction.

151
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,129
Got me a little anxious.

152
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,340
It made the research team
a little anxious too...

153
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,927
...so the decision was made
to terminate the experiment...

154
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:10,055
...to run more research to see
what we were dealing with.

155
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:15,186
You were going to gas her?

156
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,396
That was the decision.

157
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:20,733
It makes you feel mad.

158
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,821
You feel mad that you had to
kill her, don't you?

159
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,364
I don't know.

160
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:35,040
Yes.

161
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:45,383
Yesterday the body of a transient was
found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.

162
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,345
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...

163
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:51,765
...he was killed by our creation,
by our Sil.

164
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:53,475
Found any other bodies?

165
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,185
- Not yet.
- You will.

166
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,062
She's a predator.

167
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:58,980
Her eyes are in front...

168
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:03,151
...so she can judge the distance
to her prey.

169
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:04,486
That's right.

170
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:06,071
Where'd you learn that?

171
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,491
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

172
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,994
I caught that show myself.

173
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:16,164
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?

174
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:17,791
As the...

175
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,962
...non-scientist amongst us,
are you clear about what's going on?

176
00:23:22,922 --> 00:23:24,132
I think so.

177
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:27,760
You created a monster...

178
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:30,972
...with a formula you got
from outer space.

179
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:35,268
The damn thing got away. Now you
want us to hunt it down and kill it.

180
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:38,271
Now, is that pretty close?

181
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:40,189
I guess.

182
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,649
<i>You don't want us...</i>

183
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:44,944
...to capture her alive
so that we can study her?

184
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:50,700
Laura, I think this is strictly a
search and destroy operation.

185
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,413
Nobody ever asked me to find
anything they didn't want dead.

186
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:57,957
I'm sorry for you.

187
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,960
Yeah, well...

188
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:02,628
Thank you, Dan.

189
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,131
I'm sorry for her.

190
00:24:07,842 --> 00:24:09,969
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

191
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:14,390
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles. This is
the terminal stop for the Desert Star.</i>

192
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,143
<i>All passengers please disembark.</i>

193
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:37,892
Something bad happened here.

194
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,061
- No shit.
- Crushed her larynx.

195
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,938
She was afraid.

196
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:44,566
She's scared, frightened.

197
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:47,652
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.

198
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:50,488
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.

199
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:53,950
She's storing calories for something.

200
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,577
Any ideas?

201
00:25:57,203 --> 00:25:58,413
Oh, my...

202
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,916
<i>Well, that's...</i>

203
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,419
That looks like some sort of...

204
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:07,464
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.

205
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:10,091
What are we looking for,
a giant moth?

206
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,512
If that is a cocoon...

207
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,223
...she'll be fully-grown now.
- Fully-grown.

208
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:19,894
Maybe that's how
she got by our people.

209
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:21,729
They were looking for a child.

210
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:23,606
She is a child.

211
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:27,651
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.

212
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:38,579
Get the conductors' ID and credit card
numbers on your computer.

213
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,831
There's no sign of them on the train.

214
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:43,959
- Let's assume she took them.
- I'll see to that.

215
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,836
She kills if she's threatened.

216
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:49,465
And she has no remorse about it.
None.

217
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:52,009
Of course, Los Angeles
is perfect for her.

218
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,803
It's a city of the future.

219
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,221
Anything goes.

220
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:58,182
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.

221
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:00,434
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.

222
00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:02,645
Whatever she does,
no one will notice her.

223
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:05,022
Well, whatever. So...

224
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:08,984
Los Angeles is where the battle
will be fought...

225
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:11,695
...and won.

226
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:39,224
You look very pretty.

227
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,519
Do you have a hundred?

228
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,273
Here we are.

229
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:52,195
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.

230
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:56,700
Are you foreign?

231
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,204
Do you speak English?

232
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,709
- Yes.
- Here. You keep this.

233
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,296
Here, let me take this.

234
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,840
Be careful here.

235
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,383
Yes.

236
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,142
Watch your step.

237
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,573
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...

238
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:40,244
...is being moved to some empty virus
research labs at the university.

239
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:43,956
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.

240
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:47,418
Check into your rooms. Everyone out
front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.

241
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:49,086
What will we do?

242
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,589
Process the evidence from the train.

243
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,301
Could we try growing this creature
with its own DNA?

244
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,640
We do a version without ours this time
and investigate its vulnerabilities.

245
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,933
That'd be good.

246
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,644
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.

247
00:29:04,894 --> 00:29:07,605
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage...

248
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,775
You're right. At least we'd know
what we were dealing with.

249
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:12,005
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.

250
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:15,508
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
- I want a room.

251
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:20,555
62, including tax. That'll just
about cover the Honeymoon Suite.

252
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:41,701
<i>Hi. Come here often?</i>

253
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:44,245
<i>What's your sign?</i>

254
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,424
<i>Tired of brunette?</i>

255
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:58,343
<i>Change.</i>

256
00:30:58,593 --> 00:31:00,887
<i>Change the color of your hair.</i>

257
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:02,388
<i>Color-Tress.</i>

258
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:12,942
I've increased the magnification.

259
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:22,284
When I pierce the cell,
the foreign DNA will be introduced.

260
00:31:33,337 --> 00:31:34,547
Shit!

261
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:36,966
The camera's gone down.

262
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:39,218
Excuse me.

263
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:41,595
Do you have a replacement camera?

264
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:45,433
We do, but it'll take time for
the technician to replace it.

265
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:49,311
No. This happens in my lab
all the time. It's simple to replace it.

266
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,230
You saying you can do it?

267
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,191
Sure I can. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

268
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,611
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.

269
00:31:57,862 --> 00:31:59,071
I'll do it.

270
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:01,824
I'll do it.

271
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:04,952
- Man of action, I like that.
- That's me.

272
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:17,466
Can you get that one for me?

273
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,783
Give me the camera.

274
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:58,215
Something's... Something's wrong.

275
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:05,972
Christ, It's started already.

276
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,644
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?

277
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,938
Laura, Press, get the top back on.

278
00:33:13,231 --> 00:33:14,524
Here you go.

279
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:17,485
She must have penetrated the cell.

280
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:20,530
- Shit.
- What was that?

281
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:21,823
He dropped the bolt.

282
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:26,494
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

283
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:29,914
Can they hear me in there?

284
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:31,374
Laura, Press...

285
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:34,669
<i>...get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?</i>

286
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:41,342
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?

287
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:47,014
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.

288
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:48,724
- No, can't get it!
- Press...

289
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,726
...you gotta get the bolt!

290
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:54,772
- Can't get it. The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.

291
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:56,732
Press. Oh, my God.

292
00:33:56,941 --> 00:33:59,068
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Holy shit.

293
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:00,653
I can't let them out.

294
00:34:00,862 --> 00:34:03,281
- Press, look.
- Come on.

295
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:06,243
Fitch, let us out of here!

296
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:08,328
Open the goddamn door!

297
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,707
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!

298
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:13,417
- Let them out.
- I can't!

299
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,878
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!

300
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:19,923
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!

301
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:24,970
Open up the door!

302
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,638
Press, Press.

303
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,516
What the fuck is that?!

304
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,102
Laura, get to the other door!

305
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,354
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't!

306
00:34:34,646 --> 00:34:36,398
- Let her out!
- I can't!

307
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:38,275
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!

308
00:34:38,484 --> 00:34:40,944
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!

309
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,446
Get out of the way!

310
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:44,615
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!

311
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:51,413
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!

312
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,791
I have to do it!

313
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,459
You have two minutes to kill it.

314
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:58,879
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.

315
00:35:06,095 --> 00:35:07,555
Laura, watch out!

316
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:12,102
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!

317
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:13,812
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

318
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:19,317
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

319
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:32,914
Laura...

320
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:35,667
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.

321
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,711
It's dead! Open the door!

322
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,672
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.

323
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:47,470
Oh, God, it's not dead.

324
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:56,980
- Shit.
- What'll we do?

325
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,690
<i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

326
00:35:58,898 --> 00:36:01,526
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!

327
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:03,446
- Let them out.
- I can't do that.

328
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,573
- I have to follow protocol!
- What protocol?!

329
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:07,575
The protocols by which
we're doing this!

330
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:10,453
You didn't tell them that
before they went in.

331
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,122
<i>- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10...</i>

332
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,875
- Fitch, let them out!
- I must follow protocol.

333
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,334
Let them out, Fitch!

334
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,879
Go. Get out of there!

335
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:23,048
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

336
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:25,009
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.

337
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:28,596
The protocol is to burn the room
if anything went wrong!

338
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:51,410
Where's a good place
to find a man?

339
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:55,664
There's plenty of guys at the Id
around the corner. It's a club.

340
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:58,209
You won't have trouble
meeting somebody there.

341
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,418
Thank you.

342
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:02,130
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.

343
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,424
I need your credit card...

344
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,303
...for room incidentals,
long distance calls and so forth.

345
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:10,263
Credit card? Zip zap?

346
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:12,933
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?

347
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:15,852
There you go. Thanks. All right.

348
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:17,187
Thank you.

349
00:37:18,146 --> 00:37:19,439
Wait a minute!

350
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:26,696
You don't want this falling
into the wrong hands.

351
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,365
No.

352
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:33,870
<i>Here's Justin Crawl. It's through
and it's covered by the goalie.</i>

353
00:37:36,164 --> 00:37:37,165
Yeah?

354
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:39,167
The conductor's credit card
turned up...

355
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:42,003
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.

356
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:43,463
<i>Let's go.</i>

357
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:48,301
You two.

358
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:54,975
Enjoy yourselves.

359
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,645
You, legs. You're in. Go on.

360
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:22,670
Where are you from?

361
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:26,215
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?

362
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:28,509
- I'm foreign.
- Really?

363
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:30,511
Easy, easy.

364
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,556
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

365
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:35,141
I'll take you.

366
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,767
- You will?
- Yeah.

367
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,020
Okay. I'm going
to the little girls' room.

368
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:41,939
Wait right here.

369
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:43,858
I'll be right back.

370
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:45,526
I'll be right here.

371
00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:06,423
Whatever it takes, right?

372
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:09,843
All's fair in love and war.

373
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:36,578
Can't see much on that.

374
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:39,456
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.

375
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:41,625
See if we can get a better look.

376
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:43,627
She looks nice.

377
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:46,255
Do you have any idea
where she went?

378
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:50,008
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.

379
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:52,970
I suggested a club called
the Id around the corner.

380
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:56,306
Get the tape.

381
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:18,496
I've got a party to go to
and no one to take me.

382
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:20,790
Where is this party?

383
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:22,667
I don't know.

384
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,637
Whoa, you can't park there!

385
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:36,598
Back that out!

386
00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:40,477
- No, you can't go in there.
- What's going on?!

387
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:59,163
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!

388
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:05,336
There's always some action
in this part of town.

389
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:19,517
<i>Blue-eyed blonde.</i>

390
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,687
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10"
tall. Who'd she leave with?

391
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:26,524
Blonde leaves with a guy
is hardly news around here.

392
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:28,692
Name the top attractions. No losers.

393
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:31,237
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.

394
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,489
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

395
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:35,366
I'm thinking.

396
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,327
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

397
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:40,663
That's him.

398
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,541
Come on. Let me show you
the rest of the house.

399
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,544
I'm still sweaty from that place.

400
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:48,212
It's so crowded.

401
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:54,761
Like it?

402
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:57,222
Yes.

403
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,932
I feel like a shower.

404
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:01,101
You want one?

405
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,395
Tell you what.

406
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:05,063
I'm taking one.

407
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,982
You wanna take one later...

408
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,650
...no problem.

409
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:54,280
Take off your clothes.

410
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,617
I want to see you.

411
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,626
Very nice.

412
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,554
Take me back.

413
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,681
What are you talking about?

414
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,683
You know why we came here.

415
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,644
I've changed my mind.

416
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,271
All right. You said "no."

417
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,066
It's duly noted. Come here.

418
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,359
I wanna go!

419
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,612
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!

420
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,284
- All right.
- That's better.

421
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:12,796
What's happening? Kills a girl
at the club, kills this guy.

422
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,049
I'd say she fits the definition
of a psychopath.

423
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,092
Nothing inhibits her.

424
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:21,012
No moral sense, no social structure.

425
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:25,391
She wasn't exactly smothered with a
mother's love or taught good manners.

426
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,352
I asked what was happening.

427
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,729
He did something, she was angry.

428
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:32,899
She'll kill if she's threatened
or if anyone gets in her way.

429
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:34,317
Of what?

430
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:35,777
Her life cycle.

431
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:38,113
I think she's trying to mate.

432
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:39,489
Reproduce.

433
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,116
Okay.

434
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:43,076
So why did she kill the girl?

435
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:45,078
Sexual competition.

436
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:46,830
She's hard on the competition.

437
00:45:47,205 --> 00:45:48,456
Now she managed to mate.

438
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:52,753
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.

439
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:55,256
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

440
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:58,092
What's her problem?
She was here with him.

441
00:45:58,342 --> 00:45:59,927
Maybe she rejected him.

442
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,054
She probably has special senses.

443
00:46:02,263 --> 00:46:06,517
Rats can sense diseased or genetic
damage in their potential mates...

444
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:08,185
...so we can test his body...

445
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:12,982
...for hereditary diseases or defects
that would make him a loser...

446
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,483
...essentially.

447
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:15,985
Needles.

448
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:19,738
Maybe he was a doper,
or a diabetic.

449
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,825
Either way would make him
unacceptable. Excuse me.

450
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,162
All right.

451
00:46:28,456 --> 00:46:30,666
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

452
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,544
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?

453
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:35,880
He pissed her off.

454
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,549
Some men, when rejected,
get insistent.

455
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:41,385
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.

456
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:44,597
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.

457
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,851
More docile and controllable,
huh, Fitch?

458
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:04,951
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?

459
00:47:05,827 --> 00:47:08,538
I think she'd want to be alone now.

460
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:12,542
She won't come here with
all these cars outside.

461
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:15,712
You're assuming she could
find her way back here.

462
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:17,130
She could.

463
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:18,965
What is it?

464
00:47:20,592 --> 00:47:22,511
Maybe menstrual blood.

465
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:26,056
If she's menstruating,
she can reproduce.

466
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:27,516
Yes, I know.

467
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:05,657
Shit.

468
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:12,664
Oh, Jesus.

469
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:14,124
Excuse me.

470
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:17,836
Call a paramedic! Anybody
got a phone?

471
00:49:23,425 --> 00:49:26,261
<i>If your commute takes you westbound
on the 10 freeway...</i>

472
00:49:26,512 --> 00:49:28,013
<i>...expect an hour delay.</i>

473
00:49:28,263 --> 00:49:30,641
<i>The drive will be slow to Malibu.</i>

474
00:49:37,606 --> 00:49:40,109
The video enhancement
is not that great.

475
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:42,486
How old do you think she is?
Twenty, 23?

476
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:46,825
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

477
00:49:47,075 --> 00:49:49,035
Her biological clock must be
in hyperdrive.

478
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:50,370
She wants a baby.

479
00:49:50,578 --> 00:49:53,289
If she has a child our problems
have just begun.

480
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,584
If her offspring is male and develops
at the same rate as Sil...

481
00:49:57,877 --> 00:50:00,421
...it could reproduce in 6 months.

482
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,259
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

483
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:05,927
Fitch.

484
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:10,557
When a predatory species
is introduced...

485
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:12,392
...into a closed ecological system...

486
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,645
...the extinction of the weaker species
is inevitable.

487
00:50:15,854 --> 00:50:18,565
They found the murdered guy's BMW,
out of gas in Santa Monica.

488
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,024
What's her name?

489
00:50:20,275 --> 00:50:22,402
- I don't know.
- Who are you?

490
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,698
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.

491
00:50:26,948 --> 00:50:28,700
You think she's got insurance?

492
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:32,454
I don't know. Just put it on
my credit card for now.

493
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,624
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.

494
00:50:43,966 --> 00:50:46,469
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

495
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:52,057
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.

496
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:54,643
It looks like a scapula fracture.

497
00:51:04,153 --> 00:51:05,780
Your shoulder wound.

498
00:51:09,158 --> 00:51:10,951
What's going on here?

499
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,918
Doctor, we need you now.
A child burn victim just came in.

500
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:20,961
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.

501
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,756
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?

502
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:26,008
Please. We need you immediately.

503
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:36,185
You're okay.

504
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:37,603
I'm okay.

505
00:51:37,853 --> 00:51:40,357
I was sure you were
seriously injured.

506
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:42,025
I'm okay.

507
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,319
You are. It's a miracle.

508
00:51:45,237 --> 00:51:46,321
Can we go?

509
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:49,282
Did the doctor say you could go?

510
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:50,700
Yes.

511
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,621
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.

512
00:51:57,374 --> 00:52:01,837
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital
called in with some weird story.

513
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:04,172
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.

514
00:52:04,548 --> 00:52:05,799
Laura...

515
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:08,343
...Press, take a car, check it out.

516
00:52:08,552 --> 00:52:11,138
- Parkbay Hospital?
- Yeah, Parkbay.

517
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:14,683
She walked.

518
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:16,768
She walked.

519
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:19,855
She walked that way...

520
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:22,691
...not too long ago.

521
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,826
Got some fruit and cheese.

522
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:36,288
What is that?

523
00:52:36,705 --> 00:52:38,206
You mean the hot tub?

524
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,376
A hot tub.

525
00:52:40,918 --> 00:52:42,253
I love this place.

526
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:45,339
It's away from the traffic
and business and people.

527
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:48,342
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. Anymore.

528
00:52:48,885 --> 00:52:50,052
Here.

529
00:52:50,386 --> 00:52:52,180
We'll immortalize the moment.

530
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:03,608
Look at the camera.

531
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:12,533
- This girl literally reformed her bones.
- It's her.

532
00:53:13,576 --> 00:53:14,869
Who checked her in?

533
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:16,996
I don't know. Let's find out.

534
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:20,625
She had no insurance so this guy
put it on his own credit card.

535
00:53:22,585 --> 00:53:24,879
Here's the file. John F. Carey.

536
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:29,759
You don't have a driver's license
or home address?

537
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:33,471
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.

538
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,516
Give us a printout
of what you've got.

539
00:53:36,766 --> 00:53:38,060
No problem.

540
00:53:41,313 --> 00:53:42,523
Some candy?

541
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:55,786
It's in the Palisades and
he's got a phone number.

542
00:53:56,495 --> 00:53:59,498
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to get John Carey on the line.

543
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,363
I'd better get the phone.

544
00:54:38,705 --> 00:54:41,040
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?

545
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:42,542
Yeah.

546
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,171
Tell him he's about to copulate
with a creature from outer space.

547
00:54:47,213 --> 00:54:49,048
- Copulate, huh?
- Yeah.

548
00:54:50,717 --> 00:54:51,926
I like you.

549
00:54:52,218 --> 00:54:53,428
I know.

550
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:00,602
It's not too soon for us
to be together.

551
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:03,938
No, it's not too soon.

552
00:55:05,982 --> 00:55:07,442
You don't need these.

553
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:09,903
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.

554
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,626
What's the matter?

555
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:26,544
Take it easy.

556
00:55:29,422 --> 00:55:30,882
Just relax.

557
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:33,885
There's plenty of time.

558
00:55:42,686 --> 00:55:43,896
What is it?

559
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:48,609
I think someone's at the door.

560
00:55:48,818 --> 00:55:50,027
Don't go.

561
00:55:50,778 --> 00:55:52,863
Please. I want a baby.

562
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:55,407
What?! Excuse me?

563
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:07,419
Let's go around the side.

564
00:56:50,797 --> 00:56:51,965
<i>Outside.</i>

565
00:58:49,668 --> 00:58:52,754
- What happened?
- A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!

566
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:55,424
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.

567
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:57,801
I wanna make sure
she's not still here.

568
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:28,207
Perhaps we should check the body
for evidence that they've had sex.

569
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,967
I used to be scared
at the sight of blood.

570
00:59:38,843 --> 00:59:40,637
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.

571
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,389
Oh, yes.

572
01:00:09,207 --> 01:00:11,960
- Help me, please!
- Oh, my God. What's the matter?

573
01:00:13,002 --> 01:00:14,796
We found this in the living room.

574
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:17,966
She liked him.

575
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:21,511
Well, not enough.

576
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,306
Can't see any more on that than
we did on the video monitor.

577
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:27,768
He didn't get a good picture of her.

578
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:31,021
There's no evidence of semen
in the hot tub water.

579
01:00:31,522 --> 01:00:33,023
Maybe she took it with.

580
01:00:33,232 --> 01:00:35,359
So she probably
hasn't managed to mate.

581
01:00:35,651 --> 01:00:38,654
- We interrupted her.
- Yes, I think we did.

582
01:00:38,904 --> 01:00:40,865
Give me something I can use.

583
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:44,201
What have you
come up with lately, Fitch?

584
01:00:49,915 --> 01:00:51,375
She's not scared of us.

585
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:53,043
That's for sure.

586
01:00:56,964 --> 01:00:58,424
We're all beat.

587
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,634
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.

588
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:03,095
Tomorrow night...

589
01:01:03,512 --> 01:01:05,222
...we'll go back to the club.

590
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:08,058
<i>- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.</i>

591
01:01:11,187 --> 01:01:12,396
She's not stupid.

592
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:14,106
She won't repeat herself.

593
01:01:14,356 --> 01:01:17,568
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.

594
01:01:17,818 --> 01:01:18,819
I'm not sure.

595
01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:21,739
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.

596
01:01:21,947 --> 01:01:23,616
<i>I'd rather try the club...</i>

597
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:28,246
...than sit at the command center
reminiscing about how close we got.

598
01:01:41,676 --> 01:01:44,429
She would make one excellent
biological weapon.

599
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:48,600
If someone thought we were some
kind of galactic weed that would...

600
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,811
...spread through the universe.

601
01:01:51,978 --> 01:01:54,147
<i>So what you're saying is that...</i>

602
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:56,775
...she's the cure and
we're the disease.

603
01:01:57,317 --> 01:01:58,777
That's well said.

604
01:01:59,903 --> 01:02:01,404
"Baker, Laura.

605
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:05,325
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi v alley, california."

606
01:02:05,575 --> 01:02:06,952
That's you, right?

607
01:02:07,744 --> 01:02:09,454
Last time I checked.

608
01:02:09,913 --> 01:02:11,832
What do you do for kicks out there?

609
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:16,086
Pine for guys like you.

610
01:02:16,336 --> 01:02:18,463
That's what I thought.

611
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:40,736
So anyone hungry?

612
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:45,158
No, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

613
01:02:45,408 --> 01:02:47,577
- Good night.
- Yeah. Night.

614
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:52,039
- I'll have something to eat with you.
- Thanks, Dan.

615
01:03:54,645 --> 01:03:57,147
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

616
01:03:57,981 --> 01:04:00,067
Please untie my hands.

617
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:03,278
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
- I have them.

618
01:04:06,782 --> 01:04:08,325
I think they tell me who I am.

619
01:04:09,118 --> 01:04:10,911
Why are you doing this to me?

620
01:04:13,664 --> 01:04:15,415
I don't know why I'm here.

621
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:18,085
I don't know who I am, who sent me.

622
01:04:19,962 --> 01:04:21,923
- Do you?
- No!

623
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:28,429
- Why do you think you're here?
- I don't know.

624
01:04:29,472 --> 01:04:31,057
Please let me go.

625
01:04:31,307 --> 01:04:33,643
Please. Please, let me go.

626
01:04:36,062 --> 01:04:37,939
I wouldn't hurt you.

627
01:04:38,314 --> 01:04:39,858
I promise.

628
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:42,193
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Yes, you would.

629
01:04:43,153 --> 01:04:44,529
You just don't know it yet.

630
01:04:45,572 --> 01:04:47,782
No, I wouldn't!

631
01:04:47,991 --> 01:04:49,367
Please!

632
01:04:50,994 --> 01:04:53,371
My hands are hurting me.

633
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:58,960
Thank you.

634
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:01,129
Thank you.

635
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,345
Oh, my God!

636
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:27,072
Oh, my God, no!

637
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:30,784
No! No!

638
01:07:29,906 --> 01:07:31,866
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

639
01:07:32,325 --> 01:07:34,160
They just don't like to show
how they feel.

640
01:07:34,368 --> 01:07:35,703
What?

641
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:39,123
Laura and Press,
they like each other.

642
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,250
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.

643
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:44,629
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

644
01:07:45,046 --> 01:07:49,175
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a
rest. This is a complete waste of time.

645
01:07:52,053 --> 01:07:53,888
Get a feeling you're on
a wild goose chase?

646
01:07:54,096 --> 01:07:55,473
Yeah.

647
01:07:56,682 --> 01:07:57,850
Excuse me.

648
01:08:58,579 --> 01:09:01,373
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.

649
01:09:12,676 --> 01:09:13,887
It's you.

650
01:09:21,144 --> 01:09:22,228
Hey!

651
01:09:23,146 --> 01:09:25,190
She's here! Hey!

652
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:33,406
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.

653
01:09:33,615 --> 01:09:34,782
Here.

654
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:42,832
Get in the van.

655
01:09:44,834 --> 01:09:46,711
Everybody get in the van!

656
01:09:55,303 --> 01:09:58,264
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.

657
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:14,323
We're going up Nichols canyon. One
of you try to block her at Mulholland.

658
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,800
Watch it!

659
01:11:34,404 --> 01:11:36,072
Oh, my God!

660
01:12:11,234 --> 01:12:14,946
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.

661
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:18,032
Tell them what you want,
just don't tell them the truth.

662
01:12:18,282 --> 01:12:21,494
I don't buy her showing up at
the club. It's too damn convenient.

663
01:12:22,078 --> 01:12:24,539
Seeing is believing or
don't you trust your eyes?

664
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:26,916
Get back! Get all these people back!

665
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:30,169
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.

666
01:12:30,545 --> 01:12:31,754
Sir!

667
01:12:31,963 --> 01:12:35,633
We found a severed thumb in
one of the doors that got ripped off.

668
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:39,053
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.

669
01:12:39,303 --> 01:12:41,264
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.

670
01:12:41,722 --> 01:12:44,725
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.

671
01:12:44,934 --> 01:12:47,228
Tomorrow you can go back
to your lives.

672
01:12:47,478 --> 01:12:49,772
Congratulations on a job well done.

673
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:55,278
Just like that, huh, Fitch?

674
01:12:55,987 --> 01:12:57,446
I don't think so.

675
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:11,795
<i>Leave me a message.
And Frank, I'm going to dinner.</i>

676
01:13:12,004 --> 01:13:14,631
<i>Where are we meeting?
Bye, sweetie.</i>

677
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:18,510
Waiter.

678
01:13:20,053 --> 01:13:21,472
Well, I guess we won.

679
01:13:22,848 --> 01:13:26,852
- We won, science lost.
- I didn't think we'd get her this way.

680
01:13:27,853 --> 01:13:29,938
- Not that easy.
- You sound like you'll miss her.

681
01:13:30,147 --> 01:13:31,273
I guess I will.

682
01:13:32,232 --> 01:13:33,859
I think I respected her.

683
01:13:36,361 --> 01:13:40,657
I know this was a hellish job, but I
really enjoyed working with you three.

684
01:13:40,908 --> 01:13:43,785
And since Uncle Sam is buying,
let's have another round.

685
01:13:43,994 --> 01:13:44,995
Waiter!

686
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:47,164
I don't... I don't drink.

687
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:49,124
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.

688
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,669
You wanna dance?

689
01:13:52,878 --> 01:13:54,963
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

690
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:00,302
- All right.
- Okay.

691
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:20,990
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?

692
01:14:22,075 --> 01:14:25,495
I guess I've had a few, but
they don't hang around very long.

693
01:14:26,371 --> 01:14:28,498
I guess I keep too many secrets.

694
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:30,542
You wanna share one with me?

695
01:14:31,543 --> 01:14:32,877
- Right now?
- Yeah.

696
01:14:38,424 --> 01:14:41,803
I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

697
01:14:42,053 --> 01:14:44,222
- Really?
- No.

698
01:14:44,722 --> 01:14:46,432
Well, it does most people.

699
01:14:51,146 --> 01:14:53,523
I wouldn't wanna
never see you again.

700
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:02,073
- Hey.
- What are you...?

701
01:15:02,282 --> 01:15:06,162
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

702
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:07,746
I'm sorry.

703
01:15:09,707 --> 01:15:10,916
You okay?

704
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:13,711
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.

705
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:15,421
She's dead, Press.

706
01:15:15,629 --> 01:15:18,132
The tests on the thumb
proved it was her.

707
01:15:18,382 --> 01:15:21,552
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.

708
01:15:22,303 --> 01:15:26,265
I think as long as you feel
she's out there, you got a mission.

709
01:15:26,474 --> 01:15:28,934
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

710
01:15:29,727 --> 01:15:31,854
Well, maybe not. So what?

711
01:15:35,316 --> 01:15:36,942
Thanks for the dance.

712
01:15:51,457 --> 01:15:52,625
Good night.

713
01:15:59,715 --> 01:16:00,925
What do you call this?

714
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:03,469
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.

715
01:16:04,805 --> 01:16:06,097
It's got tea in it?

716
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,308
Nope.

717
01:16:25,826 --> 01:16:27,786
Smells nice, can I try some?

718
01:16:28,662 --> 01:16:30,121
Help yourself.

719
01:16:35,377 --> 01:16:37,129
Does it work on your boyfriend?

720
01:16:37,379 --> 01:16:39,297
Yeah. As a repellent.

721
01:16:43,218 --> 01:16:46,638
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably
good shape for a man his age.

722
01:16:58,358 --> 01:17:00,402
One Long Island Ice Tea.

723
01:17:02,697 --> 01:17:04,907
I like these cups of tea.

724
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:09,203
- What?
- That's great.

725
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:17,086
Hey, give me one of those.

726
01:17:17,962 --> 01:17:20,548
I like these cups of tea, man.

727
01:17:21,466 --> 01:17:23,718
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

728
01:17:27,096 --> 01:17:28,264
So?

729
01:17:29,974 --> 01:17:31,225
She's going to bed.

730
01:17:31,476 --> 01:17:32,768
I guess.

731
01:17:34,812 --> 01:17:36,439
She still...

732
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,192
...wants to see you though.

733
01:17:42,945 --> 01:17:45,406
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right about that.

734
01:18:11,558 --> 01:18:13,685
I'd hate to be in here
during an earthquake.

735
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:15,187
Yeah.

736
01:18:15,646 --> 01:18:17,189
What floor do you want?

737
01:18:17,648 --> 01:18:19,274
Ten, please.

738
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:31,203
I like your perfume.

739
01:18:31,829 --> 01:18:32,996
You do?

740
01:18:33,664 --> 01:18:36,875
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I get out here.

741
01:18:41,088 --> 01:18:42,297
Good night.

742
01:19:19,294 --> 01:19:21,296
- Hi.
- Hi.

743
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,523
Did you want something?

744
01:19:41,483 --> 01:19:43,943
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

745
01:20:29,573 --> 01:20:31,158
Housekeeping.

746
01:20:32,618 --> 01:20:35,538
Dan. Dan.

747
01:20:35,746 --> 01:20:38,874
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.

748
01:20:40,251 --> 01:20:42,086
Women think I'm strange.

749
01:20:42,628 --> 01:20:43,963
I don't feel well.

750
01:20:44,505 --> 01:20:46,048
Don't be silly.

751
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,634
Just go over there and talk to them.

752
01:20:48,926 --> 01:20:52,054
I have to go. And I think
you should leave with me, okay?

753
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,018
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.

754
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:00,814
Okay.

755
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,316
I'll see you tomorrow.

756
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,196
Housekeeping.

757
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,004
- Hi.
- Hi.

758
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,590
I was sitting over there, wondering...

759
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,343
...what two intelligent, glamorous
women were doing without dates.

760
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,095
My name's Stephen Arden.

761
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:34,431
I teach anthropology at Harvard.

762
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:36,266
- I lived in Boston once.
- Yeah?

763
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,684
For a year.

764
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,770
- Froze my butt off.
- It's cold in Boston.

765
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,398
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.

766
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,614
Cute little socks.

767
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:53,783
Stand up.

768
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:35,326
How'd you get in here?

769
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,870
- I stole the key.
- What?

770
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:41,165
I saw you downstairs, but
you were with all those people.

771
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,709
So I thought I'd come up and wait.

772
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,674
This kind of thing doesn't
usually happen to me.

773
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:53,052
I just want to be with you.

774
01:23:03,689 --> 01:23:05,232
Oh, yes.

775
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:20,956
What about protection?

776
01:24:16,387 --> 01:24:18,348
She's here. She's here.

777
01:24:47,418 --> 01:24:48,837
Press?

778
01:24:49,212 --> 01:24:50,881
Someone's at the door.

779
01:24:52,842 --> 01:24:53,843
Who's there?

780
01:24:54,093 --> 01:24:55,302
Press, Laura.

781
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:57,513
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.

782
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:00,349
Christ, what does he want?

783
01:25:10,317 --> 01:25:13,154
- What's the problem, Dan?
- I just got this terrible feeling.

784
01:25:13,404 --> 01:25:16,490
I get this strange thought,
this image of Sil with Arden.

785
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,117
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.

786
01:25:18,576 --> 01:25:20,828
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.

787
01:25:21,245 --> 01:25:24,874
I went to his room and there's
someone in there with him.

788
01:25:25,082 --> 01:25:28,586
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.

789
01:25:28,878 --> 01:25:32,631
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.

790
01:25:32,882 --> 01:25:35,009
I know it's Sil, I know it!

791
01:25:35,634 --> 01:25:36,635
Okay.

792
01:25:37,052 --> 01:25:39,054
I believe you. I'll get dressed.

793
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:56,948
I enjoyed that immensely.

794
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:18,094
- I felt it.
- What?

795
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:22,933
It's started.

796
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:25,560
What's started?

797
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:26,770
Life.

798
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:30,106
Oh, my darling girl.

799
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:34,820
In some cultures, women believe
they know the moment of conception...

800
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:36,696
Don't you believe me? Feel.

801
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:43,787
Holy shit!

802
01:26:49,752 --> 01:26:51,712
I hope you're right about this, Dan.

803
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,477
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.

804
01:27:06,686 --> 01:27:08,062
Laura, come with me!

805
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:09,480
Come on!

806
01:27:12,483 --> 01:27:16,612
If she's pregnant, we gotta
get to her before she gives birth.

807
01:27:16,821 --> 01:27:19,699
God. We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

808
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:23,744
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!

809
01:27:23,953 --> 01:27:27,248
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?

810
01:27:27,498 --> 01:27:29,167
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.

811
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:33,963
We can trap her. The fire door opens
from the inside at the bottom exit.

812
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:35,214
Then what?

813
01:27:37,717 --> 01:27:38,926
Holy shit.

814
01:27:39,135 --> 01:27:42,221
- Oh, my God.
- The bitch went through a steel door!

815
01:27:42,597 --> 01:27:45,349
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!

816
01:27:56,778 --> 01:27:59,281
- You saw her?
- She was gone before we got here.

817
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:01,158
- Here.
- You saw her!

818
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:03,368
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?

819
01:28:03,619 --> 01:28:05,954
- Where's Press?
- He took off down that tunnel.

820
01:28:21,011 --> 01:28:23,972
She kills if she feels threatened.

821
01:28:24,181 --> 01:28:26,308
She kills if she feels threatened.

822
01:28:48,665 --> 01:28:50,583
She must've come through here.

823
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:15,108
She went down here.
There's no other way.

824
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:16,734
Yeah, she's down there.

825
01:29:18,027 --> 01:29:19,237
Let's go.

826
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:22,073
Stand back, I'll clear it out.

827
01:30:15,336 --> 01:30:17,463
Which way did she go, Dan?

828
01:30:18,756 --> 01:30:20,633
- I don't know.
- What?

829
01:30:20,925 --> 01:30:22,843
I'm not sure. She's here.

830
01:30:23,093 --> 01:30:27,973
Think. You're supposed to have some
extrasensory power! Which way?

831
01:30:28,808 --> 01:30:33,020
- Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know! I don't know!

832
01:30:36,232 --> 01:30:39,026
- I think she went that way.
- That's good enough for me.

833
01:30:39,235 --> 01:30:41,028
You think she went that way?

834
01:30:42,364 --> 01:30:45,033
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.

835
01:30:45,242 --> 01:30:47,619
I'll go this way. You come with me.

836
01:30:47,869 --> 01:30:49,955
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.

837
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:53,458
I think she went this way.

838
01:31:11,351 --> 01:31:12,686
Dan?

839
01:31:16,273 --> 01:31:17,566
Dan?

840
01:31:54,854 --> 01:31:56,063
Fitch. Fitch.

841
01:31:57,648 --> 01:31:59,025
Dan?

842
01:32:01,694 --> 01:32:03,029
What happened?

843
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:13,623
I can feel her.

844
01:32:14,332 --> 01:32:15,625
She's that way.

845
01:32:16,417 --> 01:32:17,960
She's that way.

846
01:32:22,006 --> 01:32:24,634
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.

847
01:32:25,051 --> 01:32:26,677
Never thought I'd want to.

848
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:05,092
It's this way. It's back here.

849
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:38,459
Hey, she went in here.

850
01:33:43,756 --> 01:33:46,134
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

851
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:49,220
Okay, stand back.

852
01:35:05,297 --> 01:35:06,465
Is that oil?

853
01:35:06,799 --> 01:35:08,092
Looks like it.

854
01:35:15,808 --> 01:35:18,978
I'm going back there to see
if I can flush her out.

855
01:35:19,186 --> 01:35:21,981
If she comes back through here,
let her have it.

856
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:39,166
Dan. Dan!

857
01:36:38,935 --> 01:36:42,063
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.

858
01:36:42,271 --> 01:36:43,564
I don't know.

859
01:37:44,334 --> 01:37:45,586
Dan.

860
01:38:07,107 --> 01:38:08,650
Okay.

861
01:38:10,611 --> 01:38:11,862
It's okay.

862
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:14,781
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

863
01:38:15,657 --> 01:38:16,867
You come here.

864
01:38:19,203 --> 01:38:21,163
Come on. I got you.

865
01:38:26,251 --> 01:38:28,545
Press, something's happened
to Dan!

866
01:38:29,588 --> 01:38:31,007
You okay?

867
01:38:33,968 --> 01:38:35,261
Shit!

868
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:38,890
Dan?

869
01:38:39,933 --> 01:38:41,559
Dan?

870
01:38:42,435 --> 01:38:43,728
I'm stuck!

871
01:38:48,817 --> 01:38:51,361
I need your help! I'm stuck!

872
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:22,392
Dan, you gotta hang on!

873
01:39:29,733 --> 01:39:31,318
Press!

874
01:39:35,489 --> 01:39:36,699
Dan, keep on.

875
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,424
Press!

876
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:44,601
Hang on, Dan!

877
01:40:46,978 --> 01:40:48,146
Hang on!

878
01:40:49,397 --> 01:40:50,398
I got you.

879
01:40:52,317 --> 01:40:54,277
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

880
01:40:55,028 --> 01:40:56,363
Shit.

881
01:41:03,995 --> 01:41:05,455
Hang on!

882
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:08,667
Hang on, Dan!

883
01:41:13,004 --> 01:41:14,881
Get rid of her, Press!

884
01:41:19,427 --> 01:41:20,595
Duck your head.

885
01:41:22,222 --> 01:41:24,474
Let go, you motherfucker.

886
01:41:27,103 --> 01:41:29,730
- I got you. Hold on, I got you.
- Shit.

887
01:41:35,403 --> 01:41:36,988
I thought I was dead.

888
01:41:40,533 --> 01:41:43,703
I thought you'd drank your
last Long Island Ice Tea.

889
01:41:43,911 --> 01:41:45,246
Yeah, I thought we all had.

890
01:41:47,665 --> 01:41:49,834
Hey, you okay?

891
01:41:50,376 --> 01:41:51,586
Yeah, I'm okay.

892
01:41:52,795 --> 01:41:54,672
My pants are a little messed up.

893
01:41:55,298 --> 01:41:56,591
But I'm okay.

894
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:01,512
She was half us,
half something else.

895
01:42:02,388 --> 01:42:04,515
I wonder which was
the predatory half.

896
01:42:05,892 --> 01:42:07,435
The dead half.

897
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:09,270
Let's get the hell out of here.

898
01:42:53,816 --> 01:42:57,152
I never thought I'd be so happy
to be back in a sewer.
