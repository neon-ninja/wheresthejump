1
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:34,915
Mrs. Frenchie's cat is missing. 

2
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:37,822
The signs are posted
 all over town: 

3
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:39,460
"Have you seen Honey?" 
We've all seen the posters... 

4
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,556
... but nobody has seen 
"Honey" - the cat. 

5
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:45,104
Nobody...

6
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:47,542
<b>... until last Thursday morning ... 

7
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:50,519
when Ms. Colette Piscine swerved her car
to miss Honey 

8
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,046
while she drove across the bridge. 

9
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:55,534
Well, this bridge, 
now slightly damaged, 

10
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:57,212
is a bit of a local treasure. 

11
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:59,830
and even has 
its own fancy name: 

12
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,237
'Pont de flaque' 

13
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:07,552
Now, 'Colette' ... 
that sounds like 'culotte' 

14
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:09,050
That's 'panty' in French. 

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,748
And 'Piscine' means "Pool" 

16
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,686
"Panty Pool" 

17
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:15,864
'Flaque' also means pool in French.

18
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,840
So, Colette Piscine, 
in french 'Panty Pool', 

19
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,808
drives across the 'Pont de flaque'

20
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:22,897
or 'Pont de Pool', 
if you will

21
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,915
to avoid hitting Mrs. French's cat

22
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:27,082
that's been missing in Pontypool.

23
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:32,377
Pontypool ... Pont de Pool ...
Panty Pool ... Pont de flaque 

24
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:34,105
What does it mean? 

25
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:38,021
Well, Norman Mailer, 
he had an interesting theory 

26
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,650
that he used to explain the 

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,277
strange coincidences 
in the aftermath

28
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:44,415
of the JFK assassination: 

29
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:46,343
In the wake of huge events, 

30
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:47,882
after them and before them, 

31
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:50,689
physical details - 
they spasm for a moment. 

32
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:51,828
They sort of unlock,

33
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,696
and when they come back into focus,

34
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:57,282
they suddenly coincide 
in a weird way: 

35
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:59,480
street names and birth dates
and middle names ...

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,426
... all kinds of superfluous things
appear related to each other. 

37
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:04,984
It's a 'ripple effect' 

38
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:07,762
So, what does it mean? 

39
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,798
Well, it means something's
going to happen ...

40
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:13,766
Something big ...

41
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,273
But then, something's always

42
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:18,491
about to happen. 

43
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,677
No, no, nothing has got to do with you.

44
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,785
You gotta be the worst fucking agent in the world!

45
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:39,440
Come on! It's not enough to say "I'm working"

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,097
It's not enough, do you understand?

47
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:47,272
Well, if you think it is enough, then
maybe we're not thinking the same way?

48
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,191
You know what I mean?

49
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:57,122
You know what, Rick?

50
00:02:57,482 --> 00:03:00,828
You're fired! You're fired!

51
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:05,204
Good.

52
00:03:05,214 --> 00:03:08,311
Now we're both in the same boat

53
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,312
Oh, Jesus ...

54
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,901
What?

55
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:43,306
Hey!

56
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,335
Hey ...

57
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:45,334
Hey!

58
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:46,763
Hey ...

59
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,121
Who are you?

60
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,239
Who are you ... Who are you ...

61
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:05,194


62
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:58,920
Okay Mazzy, come on boy, please.

63
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,938
Be positive.

64
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,112
Morning Mr. Mazzy.

65
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,168
Good morning, Laurel Ann.

66
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:14,145
I loved your 'Isn't It Ironic?'
this morning. 

67
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:15,604
Love Norman Mailer.

68
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:16,683
Thanks.

69
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:23,036
You know, it takes a girl with
big feet to dig old Norm'.

70
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,303
So, did you give me the good stuff?

71
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,093
Let's make radio!

72
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:39,010
Laurel Ann, do me a favor ...

73
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,887
Look up all the information you can
on 911 calls.

74
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:45,244
How many in a 24h period, 
how many hang-ups...

75
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:46,243
That sort of thing ...

76
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,041
...and... thanks.

77
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,148
Let's make radio!

78
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,162
Good morning, Pontypool.

79
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,959
This is Radio 660, the beacon.

80
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:45,420
Down here in the dungeon, 
under the street they call 'Drum'.

81
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,485
I'll be banging the drum for you all morning.
I'm Grant Mazzy and as always... 

82
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:59,909
...I'll be takin' no prisoners.
Now... mmm... I got my coffee here.

83
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,677
... and taking a look outside

84
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:06,073
I'd say... that's our 
top story for today, folks.

85
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:11,498
Now, I had a strange experience
on my way in to work this morning.

86
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:15,164
And I'd like to get some advise
from you people later on.

87
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:19,769
When do you call 911? Think about it!

88
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,604
I should mention, our producer,

89
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:25,993
the lovely and talented Ms. Sydney Briar,
is here.

90
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:29,190
And 'lucky' Laurel Ann Drummond...

91
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,278
she'll be our technical cowgirl today.

92
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:36,043
Now, I didn't know this - maybe you did -
but this is news to me ..

93
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:41,288
Laurel Ann did a tour of duty
in Afghanistan not too too long ago

94
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:44,495
You're right, there, new guy. 
Everybody does know.

95
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,622
She was a "Grand Master" at 
last year's Fall Fair.

96
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:48,231
- Yesterday's news.
- Hey.

97
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:50,519
Oh, sorry Laurel Ann. 

98
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:53,895
I wasn't the "Grand Master",
but I was the "Homecoming Hero"

99
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,183
I'm sorry. OK? I'm ... very bad.

100
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:59,599
Oh Sydney, Sydney, Sydney! Come on, girl!

101
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:00,938
- I'm sorry!
- It's OK.

102
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:04,275
You just heard an honorary 
apology from Sydney Briar.

103
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:08,020
She probably owes Laurel Ann
quite a few more! Stay tuned!

104
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:12,017
Now, in our top story today ...

105
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:16,982
... a big, cold, dull, dark, white ...

106
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:19,599
... empty, neverending, 
'blow-my-brains-out' ...

107
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,987
... seasonal affective disorder...

108
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:23,995
... freaking 'kill-me-now'
weather front...

109
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,872
... that'll last all day.

110
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,818
Or maybe, when the wind shifts, later on ...

111
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:33,855
... we'll get a little green-house gas
relief from the industrial south.

112
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,891
'Hail Mary, Yea though I walk...'
- we go to Ken Loney...

113
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,209
... in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

114
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,935
- It's always brighter above the clouds, Grant.
- Hey, Ken, how're you doin'? 

115
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:49,790
How are things in that bird up there? 
Are you going to stay up there during the storm?

116
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,177
Yes, Sir. Yes, Siree,

117
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:54,425
Well, that can't be safe. 
Is that safe, Ken?

118
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:59,629
Well, I'll be up here, Grant, on storm watch,
watching all of the routes in and around our region.

119
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,597
- Really?
- Really, yup.

120
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:07,691
OK, Ken. Boy, I wouldn't want to be a bird,
if this storm hits the way it's supposed to.

121
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,858
Don't call it bird, by the way, Grant. 
And leave Ken alone!

122
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,155
I think he's just concerned.

123
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,253
Thanks you, Ken Loney.

124
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:29,390
Breaking news out of Caesarea this morning...

125
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,178
Come on, boy ...

126
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:32,097
There we go!

127
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:39,040
Breaking news: The Ontario Provincial Police
are reporting a major bust...

128
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,515
...of a significant grow operation
in a quiet cul-de-sac in that town.

129
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:48,530
Constable Howard Ing says that
it's a sign of things to come.

130
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,174
Do you smoke pot, Syd?

131
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,642
Yes, I do.

132
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:59,230
Don't make global warming jokes.

133
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,547
What? I didn't make a joke, I quoted the Bible.

134
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:02,546
Ain't no jokes in the bible.

135
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:06,213
Speaking of the Bible,
we are in a church, not a dungeon.

136
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:11,188
Thanking you, Constable Howard Ing
of the Ontario Provincial Police.

137
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:13,106
You know ...

138
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,503
Our local pot growers...

139
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:19,240
...are engaged in a deadly serious business.

140
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,235
Deadly booby-traps...

141
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:27,451
... protecting their operations from prying eyes.
Land mines have been found in the backyards...

142
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:32,157
- Cool it, Grant!  
- They have vicious attack dogs and
enough ammunition to arm a small country!

143
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:34,175
Now, these are family neighborhoods, folks!

144
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:37,921
If Junior throws a ball through one of their windows ...

145
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,728
... he's just liable to trigger a death squad!

146
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:41,876
What are you doing?

147
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,814
My producer says... she's talking in my ear.
Luckily you can't hear her.

148
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:48,500
- Nobody cares, Grant, about your...
- Sydney says nobody cares. Maybe she's right.

149
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,127
- You forgot to do the closures after the billboard, I need you to...
- But I think you do care, region.

150
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:54,784
"Taking no prisoners" - you know what that means?

151
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:57,733
It means full disclosure, whatever the consequences.

152
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:59,000
No, not 'full disclosure', Grant!
'School closure.'

153
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,137
I need you to read school closures.
That's what people need!

154
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,543
This is Radio 660, the beacon...

155
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,021
Hey ... You can't just cut me off like that!
Jesus' ...

156
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,006
OK, you know, Grant, the whole 'full disclosure' schtick...

157
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:14,534
.. works better in a bigger context.

158
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:16,852
Well, actually, this won't get me fired.

159
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:20,139
Well, there's that to.

160
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,267
The thing is, that in small towns, 
they already come without prisoners.

161
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,164
It's called "gossip"
and it's way ahead of you.

162
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,962
No no, Sidney, I'm not talking about gossip.

163
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:30,748
I'm talking about building a relationship with
my listeners.

164
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:33,246
You know... shaking them up a little bit.

165
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:36,492
OK, we do news, weather, sports, local spots.

166
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:38,081
- That's what I need you to do.
- Hmm.

167
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:45,214
What the hell do you think you have to disclose to us anyway?
I mean, what it this that you think we need to hear from you?

168
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:56,962
I don't know... Well, actually, I do know, Sidney.
I am trying to piss a few people off, 
because that's how it's done - simple as that.

169
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:01,937
You see, a pissed of listener is wide awake listener,
and he ain't gonna change the station.

170
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,863
In fact, he may just call his pissed off brother,
and get him to listen too.

171
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,899
And then, his pissed off brother, he might call his pissed off
... I don't know... preacher.

172
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:16,282
And that, Lady Briar, is how you build a loyal listening audience.

173
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:23,755
Uh, OK, well. That all sounds perfectly pleasant, I'm sure, OK?

174
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:29,389
You know, Grant, you're first rate, 
and you're doing a first rate job...

175
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,348
... but just let me tell you something. ...

176
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:34,904
Small towns, they're fiercely proud places,

177
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,592
with... with proud people.

178
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:40,738
People who need to know
if the school bus is coming.

179
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:43,685
And so, if you come in here with your
'take no prisoners' this

180
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:46,332
and your 'pissing everyone off' that,

181
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:50,508
people are just gonna think you're a dick!

182
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:57,251
- OK ... OK.
- And... I mean, you're going to embarrass and alienate...

183
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:58,940
Ok, I said OK.

184
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,647
I'm sorry, it's just the reality.

185
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,573
OK. Grant, I want your maziness.

186
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,882
I hired your maziness. I want the maziness. 

187
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:10,258
I just need the maziness to come in a little slower,

188
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:15,114
a little more 'get to know you'.
A little... a little slower.

189
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:18,420
Yeah, I get it. I'm not stupid.

190
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,169
That's not what I meant.

191
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,626
I wanted to hear what he was gonna say.

192
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,173
Come on, he was just gonna talk about himself.

193
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,258
OK. Pontypool, good morning.

194
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,794
You know, I want to talk to you about something that
has been bugging me,

195
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:36,682
all morning.

196
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,050


197
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:52,626
Here's my question, Pontypool. Here's my story. 
Now, hold on...

198
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:58,370
I'm driving in to work today,
and I pull up to the stop sign at Drum and Main, and...

199
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,786
it is 6.30 in the morning,
it's cold, and it's dark ...

200
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:07,351
and suddenly, this woman appears out of nowhere

201
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:13,765
I didn't hear her, and my car was barely even moving.
Suddenly she's at my passenger window.

202
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,903
She's babbling something ...

203
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:18,390
But I can not understand her, I can't hear her,
I don't know what it is.

204
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,117
And then ... 'poof'! She's gone!

205
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:31,667
So, what do I do? Do I call 911?

206
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,935
Who do I call?

207
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,833
No one.

208
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:40,568
Our number is 519-555-3486

209
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,775
Let me know what I gotta do.

210
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:03,525
Good morning.

211
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,063
Oh, where are you calling from?

212
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,978
And what would you like to say to Grant this morning?

213
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:16,093
- I'm sorry ... what?
- Has my sister called in yet?

214
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:17,401
No

215
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,138
That's weird ...

216
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:22,636
My sister never, ever, ever misses a day.

217
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:24,824
And where is Roger? It's almost 10.

218
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:26,842
What are those?

219
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,239
Grant gave us Valentines.
You can put them up somewhere.

220
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:32,676
You know, he... he's doing okay.

221
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,894
So, okay sweetheart, I'm gonna call Mrs. Tripp.

222
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,932
Something's coming in on the radio.

223
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:39,889
Roger, where are you?

224
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:44,874
Yeah, roger that. We still have a Code 48 in progress.
It's the fish hut.

225
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,322
Sydney! Syd!

226
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:55,693
... requesting backup.... weapons present ...  10-4....

227
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,621
- Sandy Hook, Code 48.
- What is Code 48, Laurel Ann?

228
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:00,278
It means we have a hostage situation.

229
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:03,555
There's nothing on the wires,

230
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:05,613
so I'm gonna key in right off the police radio.

231
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:07,741
Really, there's nothing on the wire?

232
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:11,097
OK, so look, let's not do anything with this yet.

233
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:18,380
Yeah, no, I'm not getting anything either.

234
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,087
Whatever you do, don't feed this in to Grant yet.

235
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:25,133
Oh, shit!

236
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:31,677
Yeah, Grant, it's Gordon calling.
I just want to throw this idea out there...

237
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:33,655
about the 911 ...

238
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:37,021
What if you had another number, that was ...
I don't know... like 912 or something, 

239
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,199
that was not for total emergencies, 

240
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:46,282
so if you.. get into a gray area and you weren't
sure you wanted to call 911 you'd call 912 ...

241
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:50,888
I...I...I just have a feeling it just might catch on. 

242
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:51,697
Some people might, you know....

243
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:53,935
Gord, that's a great idea. 
You should be running the world.

244
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:57,281
Pontypool ... My Pontypool...

245
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:02,816
We interrupt our call-in segment

246
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:06,712
to bring you breaking news out
of our area this morning:

247
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,439
Out on Sandy Hook and Wilmont we have a hostage situation.
Two men are holding a van load of people at gunpoint.

248
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:12,976
The van is apparently toeing... a fishing hut

249
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,472
Sporadic gunfire has been reported.

250
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:20,188
Okay, lose the story, Grant. We're going to Ken Loney.
We're going to the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

251
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:23,225
No one knows as of yet what these hostage takers want,
or whether or not they even know the people in the van.

252
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:26,932
We know they're drunk, Grant.
It's the end of ice fishing season.

253
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:29,978
...but ... this being the end
of ice fishing season...

254
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:32,076
...ice hut removal time...

255
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:37,231
the chances that everyone on the ice this morning is drunk
is a very distinct reality.

256
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:41,037
Drunk ice fishermen... dare I say:
drunk policemen?

257
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:42,516
Drunk officers of the law.

258
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:45,303
Drunk Ontario Provintial Police.

259
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,661
It is not yet confirmed by our sources, of course.

260
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:50,858
But, police,
possibly drunk,

261
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:55,163
are reporting that the hostage situtation
has resolved itself.

262
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:58,480
They have two suspects in custody.

263
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,574
Both unarmed, as it turns out,

264
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:06,214
and the three people they were 
holding have, in fact, fled the scene.

265
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:09,869
One can only hope that Breaking News theme music
will accompany this story at some point.

266
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,136
There we go.

267
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:16,214
Oh, the state of drunkenness have levelled off
to acceptable levels this morning,

268
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:19,809
as 'Buddy' Bob Roseland and 'Dead Eye' Derek McCormack,
OPP Pontypool Division...

269
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:23,565
- Wrap it up, Grant!
- ...have contained the hostage situation.

270
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:26,892
We'll be back with updates, as the situation hiccups.

271
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:30,588
We now go to Ken Loney
in the 'Sunshine Chopper',

272
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:32,975
for a little perspective on your morning drive.

273
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,641
Keep an eye out for crazy ladies in the snow,
and remember:

274
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:41,357
Wherever you're headed,
get there safe!

275
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:54,664
Come on, you gotta learn to laugh at yourself sometimes!

276
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,009
The story is not funny.

277
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:03,055
Derek McCormack is an alcoholic.

278
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:07,491
Bob Roseland is an alcoholic.
They're trying to keep their jobs.

279
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:15,683
- Derek's my brother-in-law... Ex-brother-in-law.
- Ouch!

280
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,578
Grant ...

281
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,644
Ken Loney is not in a chopper.

282
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:27,791
What?

283
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:33,545
The 'Sunshine Chopper' is Ken's Dodge Dart.

284
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:34,863
He plays sound effects.

285
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,066
Ken sits up on a hill,
for his aerial view.

286
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:51,157
And... people are thrilled to have him up there in the sky,
flying around in his 'Sunshine Chopper', even though...

287
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:54,024
Oh man, I bet they are... OK.. ok...

288
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,248
Syd ...

289
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:01,457
Yeah?

290
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:05,942
I hate winter.

291
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:08,380
Everyone does.

292
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,968
No, not like me.

293
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:17,681
These late winters I feel like I'm living in the basement of the world,
... and it's so cold, and so dark.

294
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:24,114
Well, you're gonna... it's gonna be ok.

295
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:34,014
Oh, and Grant, I'll tell you what: 
when the whole fish hut story gets confirmed, 

296
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,588
we'll bring it straight to you, right away, ok? 
And it's yours, even if it's not legitimate...

297
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:38,110
... you can do your whole... 'take no prisoner'-thing, ok?

298
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,847
And you'll find it funny this time?

299
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,245
I'll find it as funny as I did the last time, I'll betcha'!

300
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:07,001
I was talking to Constable Roseland - he's totally serious!

301
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:08,859
I mean, he has completely freaked!

302
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:12,326
Something happened this morning on the ice...

303
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:14,541
...and it's put them on to a state...
and now he wants us to drop the story.

304
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:15,523
Drop it?

305
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:18,670
- Now, it's probably nothing. It's probably just a hoax,
- Probably.

306
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,915
Anyway, so, we've got the 'Laurence of Arabia' cast
coming in, so we're gonna brighten up the day with that.

307
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:26,122
Laurel Ann here.

308
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:27,361
OK, OK. It's Ken Loney.

309
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,717
Hey, Ken! Oh... Ken, slow down...

310
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:35,003
Ken, where are you?

311
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,919
Okay. Ken, slow down.

312
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:43,495
Slow down ... and how many? 
Okay. Ken, just a second.

313
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,200
Okay, wrap up 'Pontypool Corner', Grant.
We have a big story breaking. Listen to me...

314
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,954
Keep it hard, okay?

315
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,442
Ken, just a second.

316
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,649
Just a second, we go live.

317
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:02,146


318
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:05,283
... so I'll check it out and make sure it's right,
that the're both at the same time,

319
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:06,701
... but that's what it looks like..

320
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,976
We have breaking news out of our region this morning.

321
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:15,957
It appears, it seems that a large
group of people have gathered

322
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:21,567
outside the officies of Dr. John Mendez.

323
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:24,823
It appears to be a protest of some kind,

324
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:29,668
and officials are describing the crowd as 'unruly'.

325
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:32,344
Now, Dr. John Mendez, you may recall,

326
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:37,411
He was the... he was under investigation for
writing unnecessary prescriptions.

327
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,301
We have an exclusive live report,

328
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:44,054
from Ken Loney in the... 
in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

329
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,882
What can you see there, Ken?

330
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:53,145
Grant, I'm watching hundreds, literally hundreds of people
packed in and around this building.

331
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,322
It looks... it looks pretty odd from up here.

332
00:22:55,332 --> 00:23:00,148
They seem to be trying to cram themselves inside... Oh! Ohh!

333
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:03,085
What's happening, Ken?

334
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:07,750
The side of the office.... this building has just burst open, 
it's spilling people

335
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,028
It just kind of exploded!

336
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:15,243
Oh, Jesus! It's an explosion of people!
Oh, my God!

337
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,179
People are getting trampled.

338
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,056
These people are getting killed down there!

339
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,938
Ken, do you see any police?

340
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:30,138
Is anybody trying to restore order... down there?

341
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:33,025
No! No... I don't see... Wait ... Wait ...

342
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:36,522
There's a.... convoy of trucks ... military vehicles ...

343
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:38,540
Where did they come from? What the hell ...

344
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:41,147
Helicopters ...

345
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,503
There's a... helicopter at my two o'clock and one at... uh...

346
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:49,469
Holy shit, I gotta... I gotta back up out of here.

347
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:53,235
OK, Ken... Ken... Get safe!

348
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:56,022
Just... just try to get out of there.

349
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:04,254
The road is blocked. There's definitely fatalities here.... 
uh... down there. People have just died, Grant.

350
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:06,322
I don't know what the hell has just happened.

351
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:09,938
Well, we're gonna have to see if we can...

352
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,937
Ken, what?

353
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:13,684
Ken? Are you there, Ken?

354
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:18,370
- Okay, we've got nothing on this, Grant.
- We've gotta get some information on what's clearly happening.

355
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,315
- Christ, this is 5 km from here.
- Not more than 3... uh.... 5 km from the station itself.

356
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:25,732
Don't say a lot, Grant
We need to get this confirmed somehow.

357
00:24:25,742 --> 00:24:29,459
Something has happened at a doctor's office,
here in Pontypool, 

358
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,486
involving a possible riot.

359
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,444
- I can't get through to the OPP.
- Clearly, something has happened, here in Pontypool.

360
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:39,359
Okay, we've lost Ken.
Go to break, go to recap, Grant!

361
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:42,061
You heard our own Ken Loney describe...

362
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:44,593
...what he saw, or at least what he thinks he saw.

363
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:52,885
You know, the french philosopher Roland Barthes
once described trauma as a news photo without a caption.

364
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:57,570
And that, folks, is what I think we have here now.

365
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,753
Is Ken back?

366
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:08,100
We're trying. We're trying and getting Ken back, 
and we're trying to reach the police.

367
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,717
We still have nothing on the wire on this entire story.

368
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:13,365
Laurel Ann and I are gonna work the phones. 
We're gonna work our sources.

369
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,322
We gonna try and find out something solid
we can put on the air.

370
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:17,650
Okay, and what do you want me to do?

371
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:25,243
Well, "Lawrence & The Arabians"
have come all this way. Yes, hi.

372
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:27,610
You're gotta be fucking kidding me ...

373
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,207
Grant, I don't need you to be a problem right now.

374
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:34,903
But Sydney, Sydney, we've got the hook.
You can't just cut the line like that!

375
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:36,631
I just need you to do your job.

376
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:39,768
These five people, you're going to interview them
and then they're gonna sing a song...

377
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:45,772
Sydney, do you really think that this is what
our audience is expecting to hear from us right now?

378
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:48,719
...so Laurel Ann and I will dig up a story on this,

379
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:52,066
that we can put on the air. 
Thank you.

380
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:59,239
Okay... Okay, fine... let's do it!

381
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:04,833
Let's find out how the fuck rehersals 
are going in fucking Arabia! 

382
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:06,601
Come on, gang! Come on!

383
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:26,052
RICK RYAN

384
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:28,130
Listen to this, Rick ...

385
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:36,212
This is Lawrence of Arabia.

386
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:48,799
Something's definitely happening, we can't just leave this.
We can't go back on the air without something solid.

387
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,996
Laurel Ann, find me somebody I can put on the air.

388
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:54,244
Well, I've got Aline Freethy on line two.

389
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:56,741
She's hysterical, but she seems to be in the middle of things.

390
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:58,849
See if you can calm her down, see what she's got.

391
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:02,505
Why isn't there anything, anywhere, on this?

392
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:06,302
These are... bedouin girls.

393
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,609
Grant, we're trying for eye witness...

394
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,667
We'll have somebody for you when your singers are done. 

395
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,443
This is Osama bin Laden.

396
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:42,156
Fuck you, Rick. 

397
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:54,324
Ok, that was Tony Burgess, Maureen Hinkle, Nancy Freethy, Jay Pullman and
Colin Pullman singing "The Nefud Desert"

398
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:58,120
I can't remember how it ends, I can't remember how it ends ...

399
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,365
How what ends, Faraj?

400
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:06,971
It just keeps starting over and over...
and over and over...

401
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:10,937
It is not called 'The Lawrence and.... 
the table' is it? No, not anymore....

402
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,837
Okay, folks. I guess that's it.

403
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:34,903
Ok, I've got Steve Van Denzen.
He's at the Mendez' office,

404
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,670
and he's talking about a mob, or parade, or something.
He's very excited.

405
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,109
- Ok, any word from Ken?
- Nothing.

406
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:43,814
Shit! Ok, I'm gonna keep trying Roseland. 
See if you can get the straight talk from Van Denzen.

407
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:57,550
Sydney, there's something very weird going on with our...
...girl Faraj there.

408
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,037
Ok, you were great, Grant!
You did your job and ..

409
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,186
Didn't you hear?

410
00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:05,336
Yeah, I know you really wanted to stay
with the story.

411
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:08,070
I needed you to buy us some time, and I appreciate it.
I really do.

412
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,966
So... I have something now, 
and I'm tossing it all back at you.

413
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:16,202
- Ok, great! What do you got?
- There's still nothing anywhere on the wire regarding this mob scene,

414
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,629
but I've got ten eye witnesses in town.

415
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:20,407
We're going live, with Steve Van Denzen.

416
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:21,097
That's great! 

417
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:24,633
- Fuck the wire if we've got eyes!
- Keep it hot, Grant!

418
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:26,681
Girl, you got it! Hit me!

419
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,918
Any word from Ken?

420
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:31,286
Nothing.

421
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:33,654
Welcome back, folks...

422
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:35,430
.. to our developing story...

423
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,739
...where it appears that hundreds
of people have been involved in a riot,

424
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:43,434
in and around the offices
of Dr. John Mendez.

425
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,990
You heard our own Ken Loney
describe the violent scene.

426
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,795
We now go to... live, to eye witness Steve Van Denzen.

427
00:29:52,915 --> 00:30:00,747
Steve? Steve? Steve Van Denzen.

428
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:08,419
Oh, ok, I'm afraid we've lost the signal from Steve Van Denz  en.
We'll try and return to him later,

429
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,065
but, we have just hed a report 
from a Pontypool resident, that confirms...

430
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:18,399
... indeed, a mob was spotted, earlier today...

431
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,926
headed through town, headed toward 
the offices of Dr. John Mendez.

432
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:23,374
Apparently they were moving ...

433
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:29,238
- And, we're still waiting to learn exactly,
- Shit, I've lost my eye witness!

434
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:32,845
what motivated this crowd, this mob...

435
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:35,502
- ... to organize in this, seemingly spontaneous, fashion...
- Grant, I think people are fucking with us.

436
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:39,338
You know, it's very difficult at this moment,
to get a fix on what has happened, but clearly...

437
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:44,084
Well, you heard our own reporter Ken Loney earlier...

438
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,530
I don't know, Grant. I don't know...
We can't get Ken back on the line.

439
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,425
- We are still trying to contact Ken.
- This is completely fucked! I don't know what's going on!

440
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,173
CLSY?

441
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,838
Can you slow down? I can't understand what....

442
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:01,846
- CLSY?
- Ok, hello?

443
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:09,039
We have also learned that some of
the perpetrators are speaking in bizarre ways.

444
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:11,466
They're babbeling in ways that no one understands...

445
00:31:11,476 --> 00:31:16,601
... and we don't know if this is a way
of trying to terrorize people? We don't know.

446
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:18,199
Hello, CLSY.

447
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,377
I'm sorry, what did you say?

448
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:23,904
- We still do not have an official version of these events...
- Okay, sounds good.

449
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:28,060
- ... but it has been reported that up to 75 people are dead.
- Sounds honest. It is honest.

450
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:33,474
- And at least twice that number are injured.
- I've CBC and CFRB on the line, wanting to talk to you.

451
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:36,670
We now take you to
Constable Bob Roseland,

452
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,477
of the Pontypool unit of the OPP.
He's on the line, live.

453
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:43,844
Constable Roseland, what's happening out there?

454
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:51,077
At 7 o'clock this morning our officers answered a 911 call,
to the Golden Dawn facility,

455
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:54,803
to discover a large number of people
occupying the building.

456
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:58,799
They seemed to be trying to get into the elderly woman's room...

457
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,715
...and this woman has since died, from incidental injury...

458
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:07,200
- Grant, appearently these people were chanting something.
- ...as a result of people piling into her room.

459
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,989
- A little creepy, chanting something...
- And what where they saying?

460
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:12,265
They were repeated things this woman was saying.

461
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:16,581
She's all senile, so she's babbling about Hitler and some hurricane
that killed her mother and father...

462
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:18,189
Crazy talk. 
Get out, Grant!

463
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,627
Okay, thank you Constable Roseland.

464
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:25,682
Now, we are also hearing... 
about a herd...

465
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,356
Well, that's how it's been described:
a herd of people ...

466
00:32:33,414 --> 00:32:38,919
... near the edge of the forest
near Highway 26, in Edenvale.

467
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,567
Where is Edenvale, Sydney?

468
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:41,736
That's northwest.

469
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,573
Now, Edenvale is northwest of us.

470
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:49,968
- And, also, between here and there, in Phelpston, a couple...
- Please, keep holding. Thank you.

471
00:32:49,978 --> 00:32:55,872
...with their two young children had been trapped in their car, 
under a mountain...

472
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:58,179
- A mountain of people ...
- Okay. Apparently, Grant, I'm being told by Rachel Jones...

473
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:01,653
- Now, this sounds strange, folks...
- ...that these people were imitating windshield wipers.

474
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:03,984
- ... but this what's being reported to us.
- Making the sound of windsheild wipers.

475
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:11,726
The police say they haven't been able to
actually see the car in over an hour.

476
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,624
- Can I put your call on hold for a sec?
- They sound like bugs.

477
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:17,420
- Sydney, I've got BBC World on the line.
- BBC?

478
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:22,545
There are a growing number of eye witness accounts,
but we still have had nothing official. No press conference...

479
00:33:23,954 --> 00:33:27,170
- ... has been held and we have no official statement.
- Grant, I've got Nigel Healing for you.

480
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,389
What?

481
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:34,004
Yes, Nigel Healing from the BBC. Don't talk to me, talk to him. 
Listen! Our air, their air - they want to go live. Let's just do it!

482
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:41,906
We're talking to Grant Mazzy, the news radio anchor from
Pontypool, Ontario in Canada, who broke this story. 

483
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,304
Mr. Mazzy, are you there? 

484
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,509
- Grant!
- Yes, Nigel. Hi.

485
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:55,052
Mr. Mazzy, is it true that French-Canadian soldiers
have set up road blocks  

486
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:58,249
preventing people from leaving
and entering your area in rural Canada... 

487
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,545
I havn't heard anything about this, Grant.
I don't think he knows what he's talking about.

488
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:08,339
...and if so, does this have anything to do with your
country's history of separatist terror groups?  

489
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:15,267
Well, Nigel. None of that is true.

490
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:20,347
The military, of course, is rumored to be involved,

491
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:23,564
and, of course, the police are responding as we speak, but...

492
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:28,209
from what we can tell there's nothing organized...

493
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:34,493
... nothing political,
cartainly not terrorist... or separatist.

494
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:39,678
But, Mr. Mazzy, this certainly looks like
an insurgency of some kind.  

495
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:42,755
Large groups of people
are involved.  

496
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:47,790
But, if it's not organized, as you say,
and it's not political, 

497
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:54,583
then can you help our viewers at home
understand exactly what it is we've been reporting on?  

498
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,031
He's good.

499
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,154
Nigel, the honest truth is that no one has officially
come out ahead on this.

500
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:07,330
We simply do not know.

501
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,530
There you have it ... 

502
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,805
A series of strange riots
and violent mob scenes 

503
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:17,830
in rural Canada, that no one, I repeat,
no one can explain.  

504
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,151
Meanwhile, reports presist that
French-Canadian riot police  

505
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,453
have been called in to
crush this insurgency.  

506
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,860
Fuck you, Nigel! 
He knows nothing!

507
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,589
Where are you?

508
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:33,624
Ok, I'm gonna pass you through to Syd.

509
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,461
- I've got Ken.
- Ken!

510
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,266
That was Nigel Healing from our affiliate station, BBC.

511
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:45,947
We now go to Ken Loney,

512
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:48,229
live in the field in Pontypool. 
Our reporter Ken Loney.

513
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,907
Are you there, Ken?

514
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,733
Yes... Yes, I'm here.

515
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:57,929
Send someone, I'm not safe here.

516
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,157
Not safe where, Ken?

517
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,065
Oh, don't say where he is, in case something happens.

518
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:05,122
... at the grain silo.
I'm near the train tracks.

519
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:06,301
That's the big silo, not the little ones.

520
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:10,027
I ran here from the entrance of the Imecan
National Park.

521
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:13,734
They came after me... You gotta send police.

522
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:15,332
There's no contact with the police, Grant.

523
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,581
There's no reaching the police.

524
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,778
Can you tell us what heppened?
What's happening there, Ken?

525
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:22,495
I'll tell you this ...

526
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:24,303
I just saw ...

527
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:30,637
I've seen things today that are going to ruin
the rest of my natural life, Grant ...

528
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,223
and I'm scared ... I'm scared ...

529
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:38,459
Ken. Ken, listen to me.

530
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:46,291
It sounds like you're okay where you are, 
so don't move, and you just stay there, and we're gonna...

531
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:51,955
I saw ... Some of them are cannibals
and others are naked ... and like dogs.

532
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:59,418
Their eyes ... that look... 
It's just a startled, wild...

533
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:02,755
Oh God, Grant!

534
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:04,583
Ok Ken, listen ...

535
00:37:04,593 --> 00:37:13,434
No, no, no! You don't understand ... I'm looking through a
little door, there's a little door at the base of the door...

536
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,508
.. it's some kind of cat door, or something. I can see the...
Let me move so I can see the....

537
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:26,381
NO! LOOK OUT! .. Oh God ..
They're pulling two people out of a van.

538
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:31,186
- Who are they, Ken? Who are they?
- There's a bunch of them. They're people, but they're crazy.

539
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:37,520
They're ... they're pulling these two out of the van.
Oh, my God! They're ... they're biting them!

540
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,676
They're actually carrying them 
to the ground in their mouths!

541
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:55,442
I can't... I can't see ... they're biting, there's just biting, 
they look like a school of fish, like a frenzy... piranha.

542
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:57,530
It almost as if... It's like ... 

543
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:03,714
It's like these pople are trying to climb,
or eat their way inside!

544
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:07,100
They're so desperate, 
like they have to be inside....

545
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:12,615
One has his entire leg and
another his arm ... it's right inside....

546
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:13,973
Stop this, Grant! 

547
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:15,002
They are pulling themselves apart!

548
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:16,031
Stop this now!

549
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:26,011
Argh! Oh shit! He heard that... one looked over, he heard me.
Oh, he's coming. Holy shit! I gotta hide! He's running! He's running!

550
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:32,175
Ken, get out of there.

551
00:38:32,784 --> 00:38:38,519
Ken? Ken, it's Grant. Are you... are you injured?
Have you've been hurt?

552
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:48,389
No, no. I'm... just lying here. I'm in the dark.

553
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:54,003
It... It crashed through the wall... it was Mary Gault's boy.
Her big teenager Jesse? Or Jake, or something?

554
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:59,857
- Oh my god... Jesse ... 
- It was him. He had no hands...

555
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:00,357
The kid had no hands ...

556
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,285
Grant, let's stop this now!

557
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:09,268
- What's he doing now?
- Not on the air, Grant. I'm not gonna listen to somebody get killed on the air.

558
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,055
He's looking at me...

559
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:17,350
I think he can't move ...
He must have broken some bones.

560
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,555
I can see his eyes... He can't move ...
Wait, wait....

561
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:26,621
- I think he's ... hang on...
- No.

562
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,686
Ken, whatever you do, don't go near him.

563
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:39,288
He's... he's whispering something ...
He's saying something ... 

564
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:43,004
I'm gonna get closer and see if I can just
hear what he is saying ...

565
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,222
No, I wouldn't do that, Ken.

566
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:16,640
What the hell was that?

567
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,748
- Ken?
- They cut into our signal!

568
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:21,026
Ken? Do we still have Ken?

569
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:24,233
- No, we've lost Ken.
- We've lost Ken, folks.

570
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:30,057
We are working on a translation of the message
we just received live on the air.

571
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:33,093
It's something about "avoid family members"...

572
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:36,081
... "Talk only to babies" ...
It's crazy shit.

573
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:40,207
- ... however, working on a translation.
- OK, I've got it!

574
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,486
It's on your screen.

575
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:45,848
OK, we have the translation. 
Now, I'm gonna read this,

576
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:47,769
reminding our listeners that the source
has not yet been identified...

577
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,301
... and early analysis has identified...

578
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:52,525
this as possibly a hoax of some kind.

579
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:58,109
And I remind you that the source was not us, 
and indeed, we do not know the source.

580
00:40:59,987 --> 00:41:05,362

587

What've you got?

588
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:45,202
That was Bob Roseland. He said we have to stay inside.

589
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:48,009
Pontypool's under quarantine.

590
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:50,686
Everybody's have to stay inside at all times.

591
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,527
Did you get...?

592
00:41:59,537 --> 00:42:00,756
Hello. Hello.

593
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:02,505
- Did you get that?
- Ken?

594
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:05,981
I'm sending you some audio with my phone.

595
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,499
- Thank God, Ken! Are you there?
- Did you get that?

596
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:11,955
No, Ken, I didn't get that. 
I didn't get anything right now.

597
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:16,790
Ok, ok ... I'm gonna try that again.
Ok, listen...

598
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:25,801
... and keep in mind... picture this... This is ... 
What you're about to hear is coming from Ms. Gault's big teenage boy.

599
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:31,016
He's lying here, in the dark. with his body ...

600
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:36,550
It's broken to pieces, and his wrists. I can see them... 
They're stumps. They're... not stumps, they're pointing up at his sides.

601
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,718
No, Grant! What are we doing?

602
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:40,447
Listen ... listen ...

603
00:42:47,230 --> 00:43:07,060
Mommy ... Mommy ... Help me ...
Help me ... Mommy

604
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:13,933
Did you hear that? I do not even know how he's doing that.

605
00:43:13,943 --> 00:43:20,666
It sounds like there's a child is screaming
inside his breath ...

606
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:25,262
- Is this actually happening, Ken?
- Easy, Grant. Easy!

607
00:43:30,936 --> 00:43:35,352
Alright. That was our own Ken Loney. 

608
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:45,761
What? That was our own Ken... Ken Loney...

609
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:49,687
- You're on the radio, ain't cha ...
- interviewing ...

610
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:53,164
- You are on the radio, you big ...
- a screaming baby ...

611
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:59,028
... coming from Mary Galt's eldest son's last dying gasps.

612
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:00,906
Mazzy in the morning ...

613
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:05,611
- What?
- Grant ... Grant ... fish, there were gold fish in it.

614
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:09,088
There was a little baby ...
A tiny little baby ...

615
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:12,265
- Grant!
- What?

616
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:24,173
Ok, Grant. Listen to this. 
BBC is going wide with the Mendez story.

617
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:28,868
He just said "Honey".
He just said "Honey - the missing cat poster".

618
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:36,031
- What?
- The missing cat poster, "Honey"... "Honey, the missing cat", Grant?

619
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,975
Grant? Oh, jeez. Laurel Ann, let's go out.
School closures in 5, 4 ...

620
00:45:04,263 --> 00:45:08,668
Are you finding this funny, Syd? 
Are you laughing?

621
00:45:10,297 --> 00:45:12,095
It's not a joke, Grant.

622
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,582
I beginning to think this is not a joke.

623
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,158
Everything that I've got looks real.

624
00:45:20,107 --> 00:45:21,525
The cat?

625
00:45:22,904 --> 00:45:24,482
Well, Nigel Healing said, apparently...

626
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:28,478
"Nigel Healing said, apparently..."
Can you fucking hear yourself?!

627
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:33,693
Don't yell at me, Grant!

628
00:45:38,428 --> 00:45:39,407
Oh, I'm sorry ...

629
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:48,338
Syd, you know I'm having a lot of trouble here... believing this.

630
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,574
I know, Grant. I know. Me too, okay?

631
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:58,948
I mean... is somebody pulling my leg,
are they, like... taking a piss out of me? You know?

632
00:46:00,576 --> 00:46:03,014
Like it's some kind of stunt?

633
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,949
Well, there's some dead people.

634
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:11,485
Pretty big number, I think.

635
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:20,916
Look, I gotta get out of here, ok?

636
00:46:20,926 --> 00:46:27,249
I'm having a lot of trouble believing that this is actually
happening, ok? So I'm just gonna get out of here for a minute.

637
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:33,194
Grant. Grant, I just need you to sit back down...
You stay there, okay? I need you in your chair. You need to sit back down.

638
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:35,092
Okay, we've got crickets.

639
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:37,419
- Laurel Ann, go to pre-tape.
- What pre-tape?

640
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:41,345
I don't care! Anything, just go to pre-tape!
Wait... where are you going?

641
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:55,761
Okay, you know. I need you back in the chair, okay?

642
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,806
- Oh, man. I gotta go outside, and take a look at....
- Grant?

643
00:47:04,242 --> 00:47:06,450
Grant ... I can't have dead air!

644
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,216
Sydney, does this have
something to do with me?

645
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:12,604
What are you talking about?

646
00:47:12,614 --> 00:47:18,778
This! I mean... why...?
Why are they carrying dead cat pictures, huh?

647
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,644
I mean, this is me going crazy.

648
00:47:23,853 --> 00:47:28,169
You know, I need to feel that there's something solid.
I need to confirm ...

649
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:35,631
I need to know that there's more happening to everyone,
than what's happening to just me, you know?

650
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,559
Grant, come on!

651
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:40,097
You! You are fucking with me!

652
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:42,504
You are fucking with my head!

653
00:47:42,514 --> 00:47:45,651
And you ... don't you fuck with me!

654
00:47:52,884 --> 00:47:56,021
Grant! Grant, come on!

655
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,499
It's dangerous!

656
00:47:58,139 --> 00:47:58,998
Don't go, Grant!
There's people dying...

657
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:04,172
I gotta take a look out there. 
I gotta see what's going on out there!

658
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:06,740
Don't go in the blizzard - I need you on the radio!

659
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:09,767
Don't walk out on me, Grant!

660
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:11,385
Please, I need you!

661
00:48:12,075 --> 00:48:13,064
Shit!

662
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:15,971
Fine, just fucking fall apart!

663
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,437
There nothing ...
Just a cold, cold, cold day.

664
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:20,606
Oh, shit!

665
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:21,795
What're you looking at?

666
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:23,024
Shit! Move!

667
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:27,479
"Don't you walk out on me, Grant" 
"Please, I need you ... "

668
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:29,457
- What was that?
- We have an enemy, sir.

669
00:48:30,836 --> 00:48:32,504
Laurel Ann, 'we've got an enemy'?

670
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,501
Okay, what's going on?

671
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:38,029
Those are my words ...

672
00:48:38,578 --> 00:48:39,467
Those are my words ...

673
00:48:41,695 --> 00:48:43,044
What is going on?!

674
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:45,411
I'm scared!

675
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:48,558
Sydney, listen ... I'm scared, too. 
You're cut!

676
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:51,495
- Laurel Ann, we've got a first aid kit?
- Yeah, OK.

677
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:55,941
- What's going on?
- Sydney, focus here. Focus. Look at me. Where are your kids?

678
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,049
They're with him. They're in the city.

679
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:00,486
That's a hundred kilometers away. They're safe, right?

680
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:02,804
Oh, God. Yeah.

681
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,645
They're safe, okay.
We've got work to do. I'm going back on the radio.

682
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:07,439
This is a hell of a shift, Sydney.
What's up first?

683
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:08,698
Obituaries.

684
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:10,586
Obituaries?
Okay, but I've got nothing taped.

685
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:11,925
Then we'll go live!

686
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,863
Live! That's what I want to hear. Let's go!

687
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:24,312
"Gwendolyn Parker was taken from this life in her 45th year
by her beloved husband Stanley ...

688
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:28,228
who left this world suddenly,
at the hands of family members Fiona and Michael,

689
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:33,523
who then died at each other's hands in their 12th and 17th
years respectively."

690
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:39,867
"Janice Gwynne has departed from her abiding husband and by his own hand,
in her 34th year of her life."

691
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:43,173
Jack Gwynne survived long enough to add four names...

692
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:49,337
Paul Hieghton, 43, Alice Hieghton, 42, Brenda Hieghton, 12, and young 
Jesse Hieghton, 10 ...

693
00:49:49,347 --> 00:49:54,742
...  to a list of passages before himself
losing his life as a result of an accident."

694
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:59,997
"Greg Olan, 56, has been killed
by Yolanda Olan, 61 ...

695
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:02,474
who also removed Frieda Olan, 81 ...

696
00:50:02,484 --> 00:50:03,483
Patsy Owen, 12, John Freethy, 33, Peter Stamp, 38 and Leslie Reid, 42 ... 

697
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:13,053
who had, between them, caused the untimely passings of
Joel Froth, 67,

698
00:50:13,063 --> 00:50:15,541
Sandra Weydon, 23 .. Tim Drummond, 17

699
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:17,959
Cynthia Drummond, 46 ...
Darren Drummond, 51 ...

700
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:20,726
and Alicia Drummond, 91."

701
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:25,401
"The Drummond's were survived on Cynthia's side by the
Hindman family,  ...

702
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,779
until shortly before noon today ...

703
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:34,052
when they were sadly removed from this world by a bus
driven by the recently departed Brenda Lockland, 43 ...

704
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:39,667
which was missed, briefly, by her husband,
Gary, 37 ... now deceased."

705
00:50:40,446 --> 00:50:43,323
You are listening to "In the Mourning" on 
CLSY Radio.

706
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:49,287
"David and Susan Varier Jones
married for 51 years ...

707
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:51,705
died suddenly in each other's arms,
by each other's grip."

708
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:53,703
Are you listening to this?

709
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:56,710
I'm really trying not to...

710
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:01,685
Shit! I left my cell phone
in the sound booth.

711
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:04,772
I want to talk to the kids.

712
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:09,617
When he's got them, he turns the cell phone off.
Or doesn't pick up, I don't know.

713
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:11,665
He's a jerk.

714
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,715
So, did anything.... this crazy
ever happen to you in Afghanistan?

715
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,539
No. Sir. I believe the situation
I brought back in my head.

716
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:35,191
What do you... what do you mean?

717
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:38,997
I don't really know.

718
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:44,971
I'm gonna go see if Mr. Mazzy's missing.

719
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:52,284
Missing ... missing ... missing

720
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:58,548
I mean... Mr. Mazzy... Mr. Mazzy's missing.... 
as in 'he's not here'.

721
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:01,075
Well, honey. He's in the sound booth.

722
00:52:01,815 --> 00:52:04,752
- Yes, I know ... I just ...
- Ok?

723
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:08,838
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go...

724
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,249
Excuse me?

725
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:53,882
Sorry, please don't be alarmed. I'm Dr. John Mendez.
I've not had a lot of time ...

726
00:52:53,892 --> 00:52:57,099
I've literally been crawling on my hands and knees
throughout town, all over... and... and....

727
00:52:58,168 --> 00:53:03,972
OK, don't say anything, okay? Oh boy!

728
00:53:04,522 --> 00:53:06,000
She's has just started doing this.

729
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:10,146
Sorry, I'm a doctor. We should slip out.

730
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,413
Laurel Ann? Laurel Ann, honey. Are you okay?

731
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:17,918
No, no. It's time to go and keep moving.
She'll follow our voices. We have to... 

732
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,267
What's that?

733
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:20,366
It's the sound booth.

734
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:22,464
Life boat! Let's go!

735
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:29,437
Mr. Mendez is missing Mazzy... No!
No, I'm Missy Mazzy and I have to ...

736
00:53:31,595 --> 00:53:34,512
We just need to get a bit of lead time away from her.
Do not worry. She doesn't have ...

737
00:53:34,522 --> 00:53:35,621
What's wrong with her?

738
00:53:35,631 --> 00:53:36,240
Hurry, hurry!

739
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:41,105
Grant! Grant!

740
00:53:42,724 --> 00:53:44,242
It's Dr. John Mendez.

741
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:46,150
Mendez?

742
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,708
You had the building that exploded?

743
00:53:48,987 --> 00:53:52,344
I think he probably has quite a story to tell.
Dr., would you like to have a seat?

744
00:53:52,644 --> 00:53:53,673
- You mean - on the radio?
- Yeah.

745
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:55,731
Oh, yes, I have a story one to tell.

746
00:53:57,309 --> 00:54:01,195
No, guys. Wait! I'm not missing anymore.
I don't miss Mr. Mazzy ...

747
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:04,002
I think it might be a little bit more interesting
that with Nigel Healing, huh?

748
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:07,858
- What going on?
- Your friend is sick.

749
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:09,347
I've seen a lot of this lately.

750
00:54:09,357 --> 00:54:11,864
She doesn't know it yet, 
but... she's hunting us.

751
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:15,870
I don't miss Mr. Mazzy.
I'm not missing anymore. Sydney!

752
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:29,057
- She doesn't look...
- Hey, come on! We can't just leave her out there. 
I want to talk to her, Grant, put the sound out...

753
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:32,094
No, no! Let's leave the sound sealed in here with us

754
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:35,011
She might lose track of where we are, if she can't hear us.

755
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:53,583
You are listening to 'The Beacon'. We are holding our own here today.
We are taking no prisoners, friends.

756
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:58,498
However, today we are those prisoners.
We are tired and we are scared.

757
00:54:59,307 --> 00:55:02,883
But, we have live with us Dr. John Mendez.

758
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:08,668
Now, you may know him, or you may recall our own
Ken Loney's vivid account of the violence that took place...

759
00:55:08,678 --> 00:55:14,622
...when the mob destroyed his practice.

760
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:22,933
Now, Dr. Mendez, we're looking to you. 
You've had some special experience with these... with these events.

761
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:26,360
We would like any insights that you can provide...

762
00:55:30,056 --> 00:55:32,514
Laurel Ann, don't do that! Stop!

763
00:55:32,524 --> 00:55:35,691
Oh, she is rooting for voices. Huh-huh.
This will grow vicious.

764
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:46,370
I should mention that, uh, sadly... very sadly...
our own 'Homecoming Hero', 

765
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:53,982
Laurel Ann Drummond, is right now experiencing
some kind of dangerous seizures.

766
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:56,979
I've seen this, what your friend's experiencing.

767
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:00,616
Ok ... can I? Ok.

768
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:04,771
I've seen elements of this.
She doesn't have a victim yet ...

769
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:09,527
So I'm not sure how this will end.
I mean ... A victim suicides.

770
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:12,164
But.. the victim needs a victim
to suicide into.

771
00:56:12,174 --> 00:56:17,099
I know this is horribly upsetting to you, and I'm sorry
to be the bearer of such disturbing news, but...

772
00:56:17,848 --> 00:56:18,648
- Sydney.
- ...I've seen this violent behaviour at my office all morning.

773
00:56:20,546 --> 00:56:21,954
Yes .. Ok, we're going live.

774
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:24,971
- I've got Ken.
- Oh, Ken! Okay, thank you Dr. Mendez.

775
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:31,615
We are going to our own reporter, Ken Loney,
live in the field. He's in a grain silo near Pontypool.

776
00:56:32,144 --> 00:56:37,858
- Are you there, Ken?
- I'm here, uh. Ken Loney, reporting from inside the grain silo.

777
00:56:37,868 --> 00:56:40,725
Ken, we were very worried about you.

778
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:45,980
- I'm OK, but the person who was in here
with me - he has died.

779
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,896
Have you been there all this time?

780
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:55,411
- Yeah, I haven't moved, but... you can hear crowds,
from time to time, passing by outside.

781
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:57,678
You can hear what they're saying? Are they saying anything?

782
00:56:57,688 --> 00:57:02,371
I have... you can't hear them. 
A group went by about an hour ago ...

783
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:04,991
... and they were talking about ... "U-boats"

784
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:09,382
Well, they weren't talking, really...
They were just sort of... chanting...

785
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,814
Something about "Look out for U-boats"

786
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:14,691
"Look out for U-boats" ...
"Look out for U-boats"

787
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,138
Where they all saying this, Ken?

788
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:21,045
Yes, all of them ... it's a symbol of the disorder.

789
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:24,062
A 'symbol' of the disorder?
You mean .. a 'symptom'...

790
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:29,537
It a simple ... and ... it... 
I have a problem.

791
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,883
What's happening there, Ken?
Do you need to get to someplace safer?

792
00:57:32,893 --> 00:57:34,721
No, no .. that's not it ...
and I ... I ...

793
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,169
What's going on, Ken?

794
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:44,252
It's... it's gonna sound weird... I can't stop thinking.
Do you have a 'sample'? 

795
00:57:44,851 --> 00:57:49,217
What's that? A sample?
A sample of what?

796
00:57:49,227 --> 00:57:53,133
Just... uh, a sample, I think a simple kind of sample ...

797
00:57:54,601 --> 00:58:00,160
And ... what I'm saying ... I need to ... I can not stop.
sample ....

798
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:06,799
so sample ...
sample, and what I'm trying to say...

799
00:58:07,578 --> 00:58:09,367
Just try to stay calm, Ken.

800
00:58:09,377 --> 00:58:13,992
- ... and what I'm trying to say ... Grant, Grant ...
- Ken ... Ken?

801
00:58:14,002 --> 00:58:16,969
I'm just gonna try to... try to ...

802
00:58:18,737 --> 00:58:19,517
Can you think?

803
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:20,705
I can not, I can not ...

804
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:22,803
Stick to simple questions, simple!

805
00:58:22,813 --> 00:58:24,731
Simple questions, simple ...

806
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:26,230
simple ... simple ...

807
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,347
That's it, he's gone.
This is what he is now...

808
00:58:29,357 --> 00:58:31,095
He's just a crude radio signal.

809
00:58:31,105 --> 00:58:32,184
He's seeking.

810
00:58:32,194 --> 00:58:38,757
Simple, simple, simple...
Simple, simple, simple...

811
00:58:39,137 --> 00:58:43,832
I think it's time to say goodbye, Grant, 
to our man in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

812
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:50,388
Allright. Goodbye, Ken.
Goodbye from all of us,

813
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:57,249
everyone listening, 
I hope you can hear me, Ken. Goodbye.

814
00:59:03,493 --> 00:59:08,158
He's gone. Well, I mean. 
He's gone... somewhere.

815
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:13,263
I'm so sorry, Sydney.

816
00:59:14,022 --> 00:59:20,106
Ken was ... He was... 
a really good friend of yours, wasn't he?

817
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:23,383
No, he wasn't a friend ...

818
00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:26,729
Ken Loney was a pedophile.

819
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:34,312
I mean, not really a pedophile. 
We just never let our kids go anywhere near him.

820
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:38,937
It's just... I've known him for 17 years.

821
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:45,121
That's just... such a long, long time.

822
00:59:52,743 --> 00:59:57,928
Shit! I wasn't a very good boss.

823
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,479
What's this now?

824
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:20,705
Folks, we're still here...

825
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:28,837
... and Laurel Ann has joined us again.

826
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:32,543
She is... looking ... worse.
She's been trying to eat something.

827
01:00:33,602 --> 01:00:34,831
Are you sure she can't hear us?

828
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,399
No. No, she can't.

829
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,664
Can she read lips?

830
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:43,862
Good question ...

831
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:47,978
Read lips ...

832
01:00:47,988 --> 01:00:48,877
What?

833
01:00:49,956 --> 01:00:54,391
No, it's a very interesting thing you just said.
Can they read lips?

834
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:59,866
Really? Interesting... how? How?

835
01:01:01,484 --> 01:01:06,729
- I should... remind our listeners, we are talking to ...
- No, it can't be ...

836
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:09,267
Can't be, it's impossible!

837
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,374
What's impossible, Doctor?

838
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:14,451
It's viral, that much is clear.

839
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:22,933
But... not of the blood. Not of the blood, not of the air.
Not on, or even in, our bodies.

840
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:25,950
It is here!

841
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:29,666
Where?

842
01:01:34,202 --> 01:01:35,780
It is in words.

843
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:38,546
Not all words ...

844
01:01:38,556 --> 01:01:40,275
Not all speaking ...

845
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:41,794
But in some.

846
01:01:42,743 --> 01:01:45,650
Some words are infected.

847
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,996
And it spreads out when the contaminated word is spoken.

848
01:01:52,383 --> 01:01:56,205
Oh, we are witnessing the emergence of
a new arrangement for life,

849
01:01:56,215 --> 01:01:59,307
and our language is its host.

850
01:01:59,317 --> 01:02:03,652
It could have sprung spontaneously
out of a... perception.

851
01:02:03,662 --> 01:02:06,310
If it found its way into language,

852
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,976
it could leap into reality itself, 
changing everything!

853
01:02:09,986 --> 01:02:15,241
It may be boundless ...
It may be... a God bug!

854
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:18,238
Dr. Mendez, I don't even believe in UFOs,

855
01:02:18,248 --> 01:02:22,104
so I gotta stop you there, with that 'God bug' thing.

856
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:24,793
Oh, really? Well, that's really sensible,

857
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:26,359
beause UFOs don't exist,

858
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:30,194
but I assure you, there is a monster lose,

859
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,203
and it's bouncing through our language,

860
01:02:33,213 --> 01:02:35,990
frantically trying to keep its host alive.

861
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:44,561
- Is it transmission itself that ...
- No, no, no ...

862
01:02:44,571 --> 01:02:50,965
If the bug enters us, it does not enter by making contact with our eardrum. No.

863
01:02:51,674 --> 01:02:57,888
It enter us when we hear the word
and we understand it. Understand?

864
01:02:57,898 --> 01:03:04,291
It is when the word is understood,
that the virus takes hold,

865
01:03:04,301 --> 01:03:08,647
and... it copies itself in our understanding. 

866
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:20,315
Well... should we be ... talking about this?

867
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:22,923
What are we talking about?

868
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:26,479
Should we be... talking at all?

869
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:33,682
Well, to be safe - no, probably not.
Talking is risky.

870
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:39,956
And, well... talk radio is ... high risk, so....
We should stop.

871
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:48,457
But, we need to... tell people about it.

872
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:52,094
People need to know. We have to... get this out.

873
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:54,331
Well, it's your call, Mr. Mazzy.

874
01:03:54,341 --> 01:03:58,777
Let's just hope what you're getting out there
is not going to destroy your world.

875
01:04:23,912 --> 01:04:25,700
The whole world can hear you breathing.

876
01:04:27,388 --> 01:04:29,366
It's fine, you're breathing.

877
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:31,174
That's your top news story!

878
01:04:31,844 --> 01:04:34,521
Can't take your breath away, if you're breathing.
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe ...

879
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,289
Go to muzak, Grant.

880
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:37,718
Key 14

881
01:04:39,716 --> 01:04:43,053
Seems we're still talking. 
Should we make our moratorium official?

882
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:56,819
- Hello?
- Here she comes.

883
01:04:57,568 --> 01:05:00,155
Hey, Honey! 

884
01:05:03,302 --> 01:05:06,569
Hey, Sweetie ...
You and Brandon are OK?

885
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:12,233
I miss you too so much, Honey. 
I'll see you tomorrow, huh?

886
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:19,626
That's great, Honey.

887
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:29,606
Is your daddy there?
Can I talk to him really fast?

888
01:05:30,315 --> 01:05:33,822
Honey, I didn't forget to call you.
I just couldn't get through, Sweetheart.

889
01:05:33,832 --> 01:05:36,739
You shouldn't be talking to anyone who calls!
And no "Sweethearts", please. 

890
01:05:36,749 --> 01:05:39,077
You should be breathing more.
... breathe ... breathe ... breathe ...

891
01:05:40,245 --> 01:05:42,563
Just talking out loud. 
Just talking out loud.

892
01:05:42,993 --> 01:05:44,901
Could you please get your daddy on?

893
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:52,483
It's not your birthday today, Lulu.
it's Valentine's Day, Sweetie.

894
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:56,799
It's not really a good time right now, Sweetie.
Can you just put your daddy on?

895
01:06:01,614 --> 01:06:08,977
Happy Valentine's Day to you, Lulu!
Happy Valentine's Day to you, Lulu!

896
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:13,372
'Cause I love you ...

897
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:27,804
Lulu? Lulu? Hello? Hello? Honey?

898
01:06:28,937 --> 01:06:30,185
Shit!

899
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,830
The phone lines are dead.

900
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:43,172
Something strange is happening to her,
I've haven't seen this before.

901
01:07:08,097 --> 01:07:10,875
I forgot to give her at
Valentine's Day card.

902
01:07:12,203 --> 01:07:15,990
Grant, thanks for the Valentine card.

903
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:20,335
I didn't say anything, I'm sorry,
It was very nice.

904
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:38,537
So, this is what happens when a
victim can't find a victim.

905
01:07:38,547 --> 01:07:42,653
This is the fate they're trying to escape.
My God, that was impressive!

906
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:47,338
And ... singularily most defies comprehension!
I'm sorry ... I'm sorry.

907
01:07:48,477 --> 01:07:50,235
Breathe ... breathe .. breathe ...

908
01:07:51,124 --> 01:07:52,673
Oh ... here they come now.

909
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:58,577
There must be hundreds of them,
pressed against the walls of this building.

910
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:01,514
What we need is a flamethrower.

911
01:08:02,693 --> 01:08:04,331
I thought we weren't supposed to talk.

912
01:08:04,341 --> 01:08:07,450
Yes, yes, yes. 
You're right, you're right, you're right.

913
01:09:00,195 --> 01:09:01,804
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

914
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,977
IF WE THROW OUR VOICES
WILL THEY FOLLOW?

915
01:09:26,978 --> 01:09:29,006
LOADSPEAKER OUTSIDE?

916
01:09:42,283 --> 01:09:44,591
MESSAGE WILL TRAVEL.

917
01:09:49,316 --> 01:09:50,855
WHAT DO WE SAY?

918
01:09:51,074 --> 01:09:53,062
S.O.S.

919
01:09:57,588 --> 01:09:58,966
WE ARE HERE

920
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,458
SYDNEY BRIAR IS ALIVE!!

921
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:56,669
Sydney Briar is alive

922
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:03,192
Sydney Briar is alive

923
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:08,097
Sydney Briar is alive

924
01:11:09,406 --> 01:11:13,402
Sydney Briar is alive

925
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,229
I looped it.

926
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:35,839
We can breathe again...

927
01:11:47,038 --> 01:11:51,084
breathe .. breathe ... breathe ...

928
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:19,376
OUT

929
01:12:28,247 --> 01:12:30,355
It's only the English that's infected.

930
01:12:49,985 --> 01:12:52,193
Do you speak French?

931
01:12:52,922 --> 01:12:55,120
A little bit?

932
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,914
We speak in French.

933
01:13:03,981 --> 01:13:06,369
Let's go.

934
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:11,144
Can I go?

935
01:13:11,883 --> 01:13:15,000
ln French! ln French!
Stay here.

936
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,657
Goodbye!

937
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:56,648
Where now?

938
01:13:58,616 --> 01:14:00,345
To the kitchen.

939
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:17,518
Grant! Run ... run now!

940
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:18,916
"Grant! Run ... run now!"

941
01:14:29,286 --> 01:14:30,205
Come get me!

942
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,084
"... Come get me ... come get me ..."

943
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:12,013
He's still going!

944
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:24,600
Maybe... he is dangerous?

945
01:15:26,658 --> 01:15:28,017
Yes.

946
01:15:28,776 --> 01:15:31,883
Are you going to kill the doctor?

947
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:35,460
No.

948
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:39,835
You killed the kid...

949
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:43,182
...you go kill the doctor.

950
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:47,607
l... l didn't kill the kid.

951
01:15:47,867 --> 01:15:48,826
Yes.

952
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:49,456
No.

953
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:50,564
Yes!

954
01:15:51,843 --> 01:15:54,750
You killed the kid.

955
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:57,008
Not me!

956
01:16:00,634 --> 01:16:03,202
l killed the kid.

957
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:08,177
So... you kill the doctor.

958
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:11,114
I? Please ... no ...

959
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,342
I'm not gonna kill the doctor.

960
01:16:17,298 --> 01:16:18,357
Ok.

961
01:16:24,301 --> 01:16:29,436
lf the doctor attacks us...
l will kill him!

962
01:17:05,449 --> 01:17:06,568
Here he comes!

963
01:17:08,876 --> 01:17:10,754
The door! the door!

964
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:28,157
Sydney Briar is alive

965
01:17:31,753 --> 01:17:32,542
Goodbye!

966
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,139
He's saving us ...

967
01:18:22,512 --> 01:18:24,750
Sydney Briar is alive

968
01:19:33,341 --> 01:19:35,659
My name is Sidney Briar
and today I killed a girl.

969
01:19:42,033 --> 01:19:44,280
I'm so sorry.

970
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:15,399
Why don't you speak up?

971
01:20:17,517 --> 01:20:18,986
French!

972
01:20:22,872 --> 01:20:25,170
Sorry!

973
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:29,146
Continue.

974
01:20:29,995 --> 01:20:31,543
Don't talk.

975
01:20:38,556 --> 01:20:40,914
My head hurts!

976
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:48,806
For Christ's sake, give it up, Grant.

977
01:20:49,605 --> 01:20:55,010
There's no secret escape plan hidden
in the words that Nigel said to you.

978
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:57,627
Stop!

979
01:21:10,105 --> 01:21:11,313
Stop it!

980
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:25,759
Syd ...

981
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:30,754
We're not talking. I'm drunk.
This is how my last relationship ended.

982
01:21:31,793 --> 01:21:33,991
Why do you stop understanding this?

983
01:21:37,237 --> 01:21:38,496
Oh, God!

984
01:21:39,675 --> 01:21:41,753
You're gonna eat me soon, aren't you?

985
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:48,526
That's OK. You be the killer.

986
01:21:49,795 --> 01:21:51,463
I do not want to be the killer.

987
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:56,418
Something Dr. Mendez said: He said that understanding a word
copies the virus.

988
01:21:56,548 --> 01:21:59,275
So how do you... how do you not understand a word?

989
01:21:59,895 --> 01:22:02,892
OK, you're talking... a lot... right now...

990
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:12,442
I don't understand something. Somehow... I understand automatically.
How do you take, like, a word... How do you make it strange?

991
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:19,995
We're gonna have killers here soon, 
if you keep killing your own rules, Grant.

992
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:27,627
I do not understand what disinfects it.
You see, that's the question.

993
01:22:28,836 --> 01:22:33,231
If it disinfects it, without distorting it, how ...
How do you do that?

994
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,276
Grant, you kill the word that's killing you. 

995
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,633
Oh, you kill the word that's.... 
That's good, that's good! You repeat it!

996
01:22:41,643 --> 01:22:45,669
Yeah, I remember as a kid... I used to... I used to
repeat words over and over and over again...

997
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,876
..'til whey were incomprehensible.

998
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,122
Do you think that's what it is? 
Is that why they're repeating things?

999
01:22:52,132 --> 01:22:55,569
Is it some kind of immune system response?

1000
01:22:56,978 --> 01:22:58,946
You have to kill ...

1001
01:23:00,974 --> 01:23:01,833
All the killing...

1002
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:05,549
Yeah, but it doesn't work, because they 
repeat the words and still get sick.

1003
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:09,195
So how do you make it unrecognizable?

1004
01:23:09,205 --> 01:23:12,332
How? And what word?

1005
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,957
"Kill"

1006
01:23:17,967 --> 01:23:21,773
Kill ... kill ... kill ...

1007
01:23:21,783 --> 01:23:26,438
Syd.... are you okay?

1008
01:23:27,957 --> 01:23:36,608
Ok, Syd, Syd. Sydney, I think you got an infected word.
You're infected.

1009
01:23:37,147 --> 01:23:39,345
But we know the word and.... 
Don't say anything. Don't say anything.

1010
01:23:39,355 --> 01:23:40,894
No, no, no. Stop!

1011
01:23:40,904 --> 01:23:42,872
Stop! We know the word!

1012
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,187
Okay, 'kill' isn't 'kill ... 
Sydney, 'kill' isn't 'kill ...

1013
01:23:47,197 --> 01:23:54,680
'kill' isn't 'kill ...
'kill' isn't 'kill ...

1014
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:56,678
Oh God... I do not know!
I don't know.... I don't know.... OK! OK!

1015
01:23:58,976 --> 01:24:00,564
"Kill" is "blue"
"Kill" is "wonderful"
"Kill" is "loving"

1016
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:02,412
'Kill" is "baby"

1017
01:24:02,422 --> 01:24:07,767
'Kill" is "Manet's Garden" ...
'Kill" is "Beautiful morning...

1018
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:09,155
...comes after everything 
you've always wanted" ...

1019
01:24:09,165 --> 01:24:11,273
"Kill" is "Kiss" 

1020
01:24:15,029 --> 01:24:32,442
"Kill" is "Kiss"? Is that is?
"Kill" is "Kiss"!

1021
01:24:32,452 --> 01:24:33,781
What is "kill"?

1022
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:36,928
"Kiss" ...

1023
01:24:39,635 --> 01:24:40,874
Kill me...

1024
01:24:40,884 --> 01:24:41,553
What?

1025
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:45,559
Kill me ...

1026
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:07,387
"Kill" is "Kiss" ...

1027
01:25:12,292 --> 01:25:17,137
Ok, I feel better.

1028
01:25:18,766 --> 01:25:20,694
- I feel better.
- Me too.

1029
01:25:23,881 --> 01:25:27,557
What just happened? Seriously, seriously...
What just happened?

1030
01:25:28,826 --> 01:25:29,735
We just kissed.

1031
01:25:29,745 --> 01:25:35,539
I know, I know, I know...
But what just happened also, though?

1032
01:25:36,218 --> 01:25:49,924
Sydney, I think something big just happened.
I think I just cured you. Sydney... This is big. This is huge!

1033
01:25:49,934 --> 01:25:50,754
Where you going?

1034
01:25:50,764 --> 01:25:53,901
We've gotta let people know about this.
We just found a way out of this!

1035
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:58,186
Shit! Grant, wait, listen to me ...
Grant, what are we doing? What are we doing here!

1036
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:00,564
Come on, girl! One last show!

1037
01:26:00,574 --> 01:26:03,741
One last... what? Grant ... Grant ... Listen to me!

1038
01:26:04,929 --> 01:26:07,787
We're not supposed to be even out here... 
What are we doing here? It's not safe.

1039
01:26:07,797 --> 01:26:12,172
Syd, we're gonna save the fucking world. 
Right now. How are you feeling?

1040
01:26:12,182 --> 01:26:16,488
Well, you don't even know that you did that, or what you did,
or how you did it...  Listen, listen Grant! Stop!

1041
01:26:16,498 --> 01:26:24,070
Listen, you're way ahead of yourself! We're ok, OK? 
We're safe up there.... if we just don't talk. 
We have to stay safe, it's what Mendez said. Take it easy.

1042
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:26,618
Shit, Grant! We shut up or die!

1043
01:26:31,623 --> 01:26:35,509
People are already dying, Syd,
while we we're playing muzak.

1044
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:39,385
Do we really want to provide a genocide 
with elevator music?

1045
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:43,571
I don't know what I did up there, Syd,
but I gotta try!

1046
01:26:43,591 --> 01:26:47,287
- Because if I don't ... what?
- Ok, ok ... It's OK.

1047
01:26:47,677 --> 01:26:49,984
- Yeah!
- Oh, you're killing me, Mazzy.

1048
01:26:50,654 --> 01:26:52,152
Now, get going... go, go, go!

1049
01:26:56,308 --> 01:26:58,456
- You there? You there?
- Yeah. I'm here. I'm here, Grant. Grant?

1050
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:03,741
Hello, yeah, I'm here.
Ok, we're gonna do what we can.

1051
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:09,085
Now that french thing, he said:
terms of endearment and baby talk... OK?

1052
01:27:10,134 --> 01:27:13,731
And... we've got your word, 
we've know how to clean that on up, right...

1053
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:15,139
- Now, what was Laurel Ann babbling about?
- I don't know, I don't remember.

1054
01:27:15,149 --> 01:27:20,124
Ok, ok... Well, Ken Loney said 'sample'. Was that it, 'sample'?
Ok, we need a list. Can you make a list?

1055
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:24,500
There is no time, there's no time... You're just gonna
confuse people ... What are you planning to do?

1056
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:26,238
OK, put me on, put me on!

1057
01:27:27,337 --> 01:27:28,426
You're on!

1058
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:35,209
Hello Pontypool. This is Grant Mazzy here and today
we're taking no prisoners.

1059
01:27:35,219 --> 01:27:39,235
In fact, today we set those prisoners free.

1060
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:43,451
So here we go, folks: "Kill" is "Kiss"

1061
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,658
'Kill' is definitely 'Kiss' ...

1062
01:27:46,987 --> 01:27:51,892
'Sample' is 'staple'

1063
01:27:51,902 --> 01:27:53,661
- Grant! Too specific, Grant.

1064
01:27:56,628 --> 01:27:59,205
- Listen to me, folks ... everything is something else, OK?
- Sidney Briar! Are you still alive?

1065
01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:07,167
When you are saing 'happy' it means 'sad' ...
No, that's the opposite, it can't be that. Can't be that.

1066
01:28:07,177 --> 01:28:12,372
'Happy' is 'handy' ... move things around, people ...

1067
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:21,812
You have to stop understanding ... 
Stop understanding what you are saying

1068
01:28:22,372 --> 01:28:24,600
Stop understanding and listen to me ...

1069
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:29,425
'Sample' is a 'color', 'sample' is a 'color'...

1070
01:28:29,435 --> 01:28:34,720
Grant, you're making sense, but if you say
'don't understand it' it defeats the purpose.

1071
01:28:37,197 --> 01:28:42,811
Sidney Briar! Stop the broadcast!
Stop the broadcast!

1072
01:28:42,821 --> 01:28:46,238
The man speaking is sick!

1073
01:28:47,836 --> 01:28:52,632
The 'sky' is a 'person' ... 'laughter' is 'walking'.

1074
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:57,717
'Yellow' is 'crowded' ... 'friends' are 'verbs'.
'Teeth' are ...

1075
01:28:58,436 --> 01:29:02,851
Sounds like shitty haiku, Grant. I may be wrong, 
but I don't think we're saving the world with shitty haiku!

1076
01:29:02,861 --> 01:29:04,690
Okay, For Christ... like everybody is a critic.

1077
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:09,245
Help me out here ... 'cling' ... 'cling' ...

1078
01:29:09,255 --> 01:29:10,194
'Intake'

1079
01:29:10,204 --> 01:29:11,153
'Trespass'

1080
01:29:11,163 --> 01:29:11,832
'Sniper'

1081
01:29:11,842 --> 01:29:12,562
'Swimming'

1082
01:29:12,572 --> 01:29:13,051
'Tomorrow'

1083
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:13,681
'Fidelity'

1084
01:29:13,691 --> 01:29:14,520
'Monologue'

1085
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:15,399
'Savage'

1086
01:29:15,409 --> 01:29:16,368
'Sausage'

1087
01:29:16,378 --> 01:29:17,766
'Tomorrow'

1088
01:29:17,776 --> 01:29:18,586
'Money'

1089
01:29:18,596 --> 01:29:19,954
'Ceiling'

1090
01:29:19,964 --> 01:29:22,934
I, I don't... Grant ...

1091
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,061
'Rhinoceros'

1092
01:29:24,739 --> 01:29:25,659
'Laughter'

1093
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:32,632
Shit, Grant! They're just shooting people, Grant!
They're just killing people!

1094
01:29:37,177 --> 01:29:38,795
... 

1095
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:41,902
Stop killing people! 
You gotta stop killing people!

1096
01:29:41,912 --> 01:29:46,488
You gotta stop! You gotta stop! Stop! Stop!!!

1097
01:30:01,093 --> 01:30:02,846
Just listen to me ...

1098
01:30:03,602 --> 01:30:07,736
I said, listen to me ...

1099
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:11,293
I think everyone's dead.

1100
01:30:17,377 --> 01:30:19,820
You're just killing scared people.

1101
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,001
It's what you always do.

1102
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:31,912
You're killing scared people. You are like dogs ...
You smell fear and you pounce.

1103
01:30:32,562 --> 01:30:34,819
Well, what the fuck happened today, folks?

1104
01:30:35,019 --> 01:30:37,347
Someone took a buzzsaw to your middle ...

1105
01:30:37,357 --> 01:30:39,924
... and they pulled out a wheeling devil ...

1106
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:43,860
... and they spilled it right across your anthill.

1107
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:46,018
But you know what, friends?

1108
01:30:47,177 --> 01:30:49,075
We were never making sense.

1109
01:30:49,654 --> 01:30:53,031
We were never making sense.

1110
01:30:53,900 --> 01:31:01,333
And today, today when Armageddon
leached out in your good, good mornings ...

1111
01:31:01,343 --> 01:31:04,949
You know what?
It's just another day.

1112
01:31:05,579 --> 01:31:07,816
Another day in Pontypool.

1113
01:31:07,826 --> 01:31:14,719
The sun came up. You did what you did yesterday, 
and it's exactly what you'll do tomorrow.

1114
01:31:14,729 --> 01:31:17,187
Today's news, folks ...

1115
01:31:17,197 --> 01:31:23,181
Today's 'late breaking', 'development', 
'just across my desk' news story is this:

1116
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,807
It's not the end of the world, folks.

1117
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:31,153
It's just the end of the day.

1118
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:37,786
This is Grant Mazzy,
for CLSY-Radio Nowhere.

1119
01:31:39,355 --> 01:31:42,092
... and I'm still here, you cock-suckers!

1120
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:50,683


1121
01:31:51,343 --> 01:32:09,065
... 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ...
... 5... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 

1122
01:32:22,651 --> 01:32:27,606
"Police are warning that travel between towns
in central Ontario has been restricted ... 

1123
01:32:27,616 --> 01:32:34,240
The Prime Minister is scheduled to adress

announcement he is going to declare martial..."

1124

"... morning DJ Grant Mazzy speaking incoherently
just minutes before that station's signal was... "

road block that prevents us from getting any closer...

1127
01:32:53,391 --> 01:32:58,206
"..that's what I was, a looney. 
This whole pattern in my head is off.

1128
01:32:58,216 --> 01:33:03,940
I feel better now, I'm having a coffee. 
I'm gonna take the dog out for a walk and clear my head, but... "

1129
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:13,770
You can almost see the curve of the earth
- a horizon. Well, what do you think would happen
if you start to identify... let's say, the twelfth view out there...?"

1130
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:19,145
"You are listening to South Hits Radio Impero,
and we have breaking news over our city this morning ...

1131
01:33:19,155 --> 01:33:27,097
... as of 10 am his morning, OPP reports an alarming number
of community crimes, vandalism, looting and numerous
assaults widespread across Peterborough ... 

1132
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:30,653
We believe that this is related
to the Pontypool incidents,

1133
01:33:30,663 --> 01:33:38,755
but want to assure the public that what is happening there
is not happening here. I repeat: the events of February 14th
are not being repeated here..."

1134
01:33:38,765 --> 01:33:45,628
"... because, my neighbour kept on repeating
what he was saying again and again and again...

1135
01:33:45,638 --> 01:33:51,113
I'm like... I don't understand what is going on here ..
Can you tell me anything else that's happening?"

1136
01:33:51,123 --> 01:33:58,855
"... families up this highway, stores and churches,
in - one assumes - the same tight fabric... 

1137
01:33:58,865 --> 01:34:00,783
...that binds all these small communities, 
dotting this part of the country ... 

1138
01:34:01,323 --> 01:34:05,588
... Now everything that we find familiar - out here, 
at this safe distance - they're in all likelyhood - gone. 

1139
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:12,092
Just up this barren stretch of Ontario highway..." 

1140
01:34:12,102 --> 01:34:19,125
"One can only hope that the disease, 
if that's indeed what it was, killed them, before we had to..." 

1141
01:34:19,135 --> 01:34:27,886
"No, but, the wife can talk me crazy,  
my teenage kid too, except the opposite: 
he hasn't spoken a complete sentence to me since last June ...

1142
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:30,773
... Anyway, yeah, we're all driving each other nuts ... "

1143
01:34:34,729 --> 01:34:41,682
"I was watching the TV and they have a brief little thing on it,
saying that there's an outbreak or something ...

1144
01:34:41,692 --> 01:34:55,359
"... I don't see any vaccinations trucks or... like you see in the movies. 
I saw that 'Outbreak' movie there, a few years back, I rented it, 
and it's not quite like that. I don't know what to think here... "

1145
01:34:57,137 --> 01:35:00,174
"I wasn't saying that it's funny, I knew Grant Mazzy ...

1146
01:35:00,184 --> 01:35:04,519
I respected the man, and I think he would want us to ask questions ...

1147
01:35:04,529 --> 01:35:08,635
He would want us to find out what is really happening - what's real."

1148
01:35:08,645 --> 01:35:14,979
"...and that's the latest from Kandahar. 
In other news, French Canadian riot police...  

1149
01:35:14,989 --> 01:35:22,831
... have successfully contained the violent uprising 
in the small town in Ontario, Canada - Pontypool ...

1150
01:35:22,841 --> 01:35:27,217
Pontypool ... Ponty... pool ... Ponty... pool ... Pohonty ...

1151
01:35:28,695 --> 01:35:30,154
Let's get out of here!

1152
01:35:30,733 --> 01:35:31,742
Where are we going?

1153
01:35:32,002 --> 01:35:36,178
I can't follow by the establishment rules any longer.
My patience has worn thin.

1154
01:35:36,188 --> 01:35:38,755
We'll breaking the limits, stealing cars ...

1155
01:35:38,765 --> 01:35:42,262
Leaving the world behind to figure out
what they believe is black and white.

1156
01:35:42,491 --> 01:35:45,558
- But what about...?
- What about? What about 'what about'?

1157
01:35:46,487 --> 01:35:48,995
It's not a good anti-conceptual way
to begin a question.

1158
01:35:49,005 --> 01:35:51,912
- My name ...
- My name too ...

1159
01:35:52,421 --> 01:35:54,190
Johnny "Dead Eyes".

1160
01:35:55,888 --> 01:35:57,057
Lisa "The Killer".

1161
01:35:57,646 --> 01:35:58,875
Where are we going, Johnny?

1162
01:35:58,885 --> 01:36:01,832
To a new place, that isn't even there yet.

1163
01:36:02,192 --> 01:36:02,971
And then...?

1164
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:06,148
Then we steal the loot and
knock boots in the free world, baby.

1165
01:36:06,158 --> 01:36:08,166
- OK. Ok, baby ... 
- Shhh ...
