00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,755
See ...

9
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,877
That's strange...

10
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,885
Huh?

11
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,842
Go away. GO AWAY!

12
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,865
RING

13
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,821
Let Me Guess,

14
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:14,420
You're a reporter from the cultural section, aren't
you?

15
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,199
You're close, I work at the Toto newspaper

16
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,689
But that's a good guess.

17
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,002
Well, if you're around here this late,

18
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,129
aren't drunk and are still at work;

19
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,435
then there aren't many jobs, other than a
reporter

20
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,972
You act like one too,

21
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,509
like all full of curiosity.

22
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,069
Sorry, but that's a wrong guess.

23
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,978
I was a reporter, but right now -

24
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,706
I'm just proofreading columns.

25
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,344
Proofreading?

26
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,411
Yeah, stuff like correcting missing periods,
misspelled words...

27
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,248
Ah, well that's an important job, too...

28
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,048
Yeah...

29
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,438
Hey... what are you doing?

30
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,350
What happened? Are you alright?

31
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,454
What happened?

32
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,516
Are you all right?

33
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,991
Go away!

34
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,656
GO AWAY!

35
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,638
Please make a statement about the damage for
my taxi company!

36
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,440
An ambulance!

37
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,444
An ambulance!

38
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,267
I'm home.

39
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,805
Welcome home.

40
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,636
How are you feeling?

41
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,438
The third month is an important time, right?

42
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,276
You should be sleeping, you don't have time to
wait up for me.

43
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,442
Take care of yourself.

44
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,424
Did you go to see the doctor?

45
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,914
He said there aren't any problems...

46
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:30,025
But...my sister called me and said that..

47
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,091
Tomoko died.

48
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,925
Tomoko?

49
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,568
They said she had a heart failure ...

50
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,367
Heart failure? But she's only in high school!

51
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,642
When my sister came home, they found her
collapsed on the floor.

52
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,741
They took her to the hospital, but they couldn't
do anything.

53
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,306
Sister...

54
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:20,668
Shizuka... Tomoko is ...

55
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,946
Tomoko...

56
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,480
Then we'll be leaving. Thank you.

57
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,746
Thank you.

58
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,280
Excuse me officer?

59
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,528
When will we get Tomoko's body back?

60
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,588
As long as there aren't any problems, then it will
be later today.

61
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,393
Why would there be problems!?

62
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,932
Let me see her face! Let her come home!

63
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,880
Excuse me, but was it necessary to perform an
autopsy?

64
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,144
Yes, there are doubts about the case.

65
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,046
What kind of doubts?

66
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,214
She didn't seem to have a weak heart,

67
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,220
plus she was lying on the bathroom floor in the
middle of the night...

68
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,786
The door was locked from the inside.

69
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,324
From the inside?

70
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,704
TOTO NEWSPAPER CO.

71
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,602

Editing/Proofreading Sector

73
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,283
Mr. Asakawa, did my article meet the deadline?

74
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,452
I brought it in at the last minute so I wanted to
know how they handled it.

75
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,885
Here.

76
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,989
Mr. Asakawa, weren't you in the Society Sector
before?

77
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,061
Yeah.

78
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:21,255
What's this company thinking? Why would they
move someone like you to desk work?

79
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,895
I don't know.

80
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,807
Honestly, don't you want to go back to the
Society Sector too?

81
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,441
Suicide in a car7 Heart failure7 The mystery of
a young couple's death...

82
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,046
Hey, Yoshino!

83
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,047
Yeah?

84
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,289
Do you know who investigated this article?

85
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,125
That's one of mine, I wrote it.

86
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,457
Can you tell me more about the story?

87
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,269
This case is mysterious

88
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,278
Takehiko Nomi. Yoko Tsuji

89
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,016
These two ... at first, we thought it was just a
suicide.

90
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,817
But something's strange about it.

91
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,186
First of all, what couple would commit suicide
with their underwear off?

92
00:09:56,128 --> 00:10:01,088
And secondly, as they were dying, they used all
their will to get out of the car.

93
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,001
That could mean there was something inside the
car.

94
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,736
And the police report? They did an autopsy,
didn't they?

95
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,049
They said it was just heart failure.

96
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,745
Both of them? There's no fucking way!

97
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,750
A young couple can't have their hearts fail at the
same time!

98
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,116
I thought so too, that's why I wanted them to
investigate this deeper.

99
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,458
Could it have been drugs?

100
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,463
No, apparently there were no substances.

101
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,189
Could it be anything like a new virus?

102
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,396
Mr. Asakawa, you seem to be very curious about
this.

103
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,199
Actually, there have been two other incidents
similar to this one.

104
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,442
Two other incidents?

105
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,933
Both were sudden heart failures, and I
witnessed one of them myself.

106
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:52,945
They found these two around dawn right? Was
there a time of death announced?

107
00:10:53,786 --> 00:11:04,219
It's ..um.. last night between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m.

108
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:05,860
What?

109
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:11,301
The time was 1 2:49 a.m. Something could've
happened at that time.

110
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,209
Mr. Asakawa!

111
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:26,841
Tomoko Oishi, 12:49 a.m. Bathroom in her
home, locked from the inside.

112
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,217
Iwata Shuichi, 1 2:49 a.m. Falling off his
motorbike at an intersection.

113
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,326
'"Go Away!'"

114
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,126
Takehiko Nomi,

115
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,767
1 2:49 a.m. Inside a parking garage, trying to
escape out of his car.

116
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,662
Yoko Tsuji,

117
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:54,035
1 2:49 a.m. Inside a parking garage, trying to
escape out of Nomi's car.

118
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,405
Are you sure this isn't all just some big
coincidence?

119
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,241
All the locations and situations are different...

120
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,512
Listen: four, healthy, young teens died on the
same night at the same time,

121
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,223
And you think it's all just a coincidence?

122
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,517
I know, but...

123
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,528
We should tell the Assistant Editor...is he here?

124
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,224
He should be at his desk.

125
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,500
Sorry to disappoint you, Asakawa, but this won't
make an article.

126
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,141
In this vast city that Tokyo is, four people had
heart failures at the same time.

127
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,970
It'll make the readers laugh.

128
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,604
But...think of it this way:

129
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,509
Couldn't they have all gotten together and taken
the same drug?

130
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,286
Maybe all at the exact same time?

131
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,117
If there was a drug like that, it would've come up
by now.

132
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:40,882
Maybe it's a brand new drug? Even AIDS
started as a small occurence!

133
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,055
Let me check it out!

134
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,425
You're not a Society Sector reporter anymore.

135
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,335
And there could be the possibility of other
victims.

136
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,705
There could be other people who have died at
that time.

137
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,873
That's enough! You remember, why the kicked
you out of the Society Sector?

138
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:11,150
Ryuji Takayama! I don't want to be involved with
that guy!

139
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:18,886
I understand that you want to use a good story
to get back into the Society Sector.

140
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,636
But any way you look at it this is just a
coincidence. Okay?

141
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,975
I understand.

142
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,175
Go back to your work area.

143
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,710
I will do this by myself.

144
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,546
I will not cause any problems.

145
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,352
Hey, Asakawa!

146
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,983
Assitant Editor, who is Ryuji Takayama?

147
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,396
You don't know?

148
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,193
Well, I know it has something to do with
Asakawa -

149
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,528
But he never wants to talk about it.

150
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,632
Wife killing.

151
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,736
What?

152
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,536
Not guilty on lack of evidence.

153
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,805
What do you mean?

154
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,479
Even with the credibility of being an assistant
college proffesor -

155
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,448
he had a very strong opinion favoring
clairvoyance and abnormal powers.

156
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,749
Magazines and television picked it up and it got
popular for a short period.

157
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:24,129
Then, he started saying he'll take on unsolved
cases using clairvoyance.

158
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:24,925
Huh...

159
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,199
Asakawa was the one who organized it.

160
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,999
Mr. Asakawa...

161
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,570
If it stopped there it could've just faded out
slowly...

162
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:41,335
But after that, Ryuji Takayama's wife suddenly
died.

163
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,378
The one who found her body was Takayama
himself.

164
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,745
No motive of suicide, nothing weird at all.

165
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,754
The police suspected Takayama himself right
away.

166
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,020
Why was he judged as not guilty then?

167
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,967
Takayama left his appearance at a show in the
countryside to come back to Tokyo

168
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,299
and found his dead wife.

169
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,672
He said that the reason he came back was that

170
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,075
he '"Felt like his wife was going to die.'"

171
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,510
What?

172
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,843
Asakawa trusted Takayama's premonition

173
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,211
and represented his innocence in a newspaper
article to the public.

174
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,646
The paper was chaos after that.

175
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:29,016
It was a big mess, with the police coming and
going,

176
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,092
Even instances of people denying our coverage.

177
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:37,935
Poor Asakawa, but we needed him to go
somewhere else.

178
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,995
No wonder. So what's this Takayama like?

179
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,503
A fraud.

180
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,770
An impressive one, even to convince Asakawa

181
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,957
Asakawa!

182
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:12,904
Hey, Asakawa!

183
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,339
Asakawa!

184
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,631
Good Evening

185
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,274
What is it?

186
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,472
You're Yutaka Nonoyama, right?

187
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,736
Yeah... What is this about?

188
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,643
The car, that Takehiko Nomi was in the night he
died -

189
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,212
- is your car, correct?

190
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,858
You're a news reporter?

191
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:11,495
The police already asked me plenty about that
day, so please ask them.

192
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,494
Wait a second. Does this name sound familiar
to you?

193
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,868
Tomoko Oishi and lwata Shuichi.

194
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,606
I'm trying to find a connection with the other two
victims.

195
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,198
Why would I know these people?

196
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,508
One is an eighteen year old high school student/

197
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,405
The other is a nineteen year old pre-college
student at Number One Pre-college.

198
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,773
We said we don't know. You're relentless!

199
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,685
Wait, Number One Pre-college?

200
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,048
Do you remember something?

201
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,149
Yeah, like a week ago, I lent him my car so he
could go out drinking ...

202
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,951
He said something about going out with
someone named lwata from there -

203
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,896
- and two high school girls he picked up.

204
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,700
- To a resort club in Hakone.

205
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,873
High school girls? Is it Tomoko?

206
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,603
Tomoko Oishi?

207
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,070
Yeah, Tomoko. That was it.

208
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,383
I thought so...

209
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,146
do you know the name of this resort club?

210
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,247
It's called '"South Hakone Pacific Land.'"

211
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,088
I have a membership for this rental cabin resort.

212
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,092
Thank you very much.

213
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,364
A link has been discovered between the four
victims.

214
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:28,796
One week ago, those kids were together at a
rental cabin at a Hakone resort club.

215
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,812
But... what happened there? ...

216
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,128
Excuse me.

217
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,236
Yes?

218
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,399
Hello.

219
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,235
Hello.

220
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,070
My name is Asakawa, I made a reservation.

221
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,771
Mr. Asakawa from Tokyo?

222
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,612
May I request a particular cabin?

223
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,775
Sure, I don't mind.

224
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,048
B-4

225
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,717
B-4?

226
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,050
Is that the one four teens used about a week
ago?

227
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,422
They did?

228
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,427
Takehiko Nomi, Yoko Tsuji, lwata Shuichi,
Tomoko Oishi.

229
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,626
Do you remember?

230
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,361
Oh yeah.

231
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,234
This room...

232
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,883
One week before their death, they all stayed
here.

233
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,626
What happened here?

234
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,984
Hello? It's me.

235
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,117
Kazuyuki? What's the matter?

236
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,763
I'm not feeling very well, I don't think I'll make it
home tonight.

237
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,395
I have this rush job.

238
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,394
What? I even made beef stew.

239
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,000
Sorry...

240
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,630
Is it really work?

241
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,767
What? What are you trying to accuse me of?

242
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,272
Anyway, how are you?

243
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,516
Yeah, I can't say that!

244
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,551
Don't worry, bye.

245
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,169
Warning: Cowards, don't watch this.
You'll be sorry.

246
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,338
S.I.?

247
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,616
Shuichi lwata

248
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,350
Was there something on top of this?

249
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,361
'"Don't watch this...'"

250
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,694
Excuse me?

251
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:53,923
Yeah?

252
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,101
Um, excuse me...

253
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,369
What is it?

254
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,337
I thought I'd watch a video or something...

255
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,566
Sure, which one would you like?

256
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,972
That's a good one

257
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,838
that one is really good.

258
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,581
Me, I like this zombie movie.

259
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,850
Hey ... what's this video?!

260
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,217
Oh ... I found this one in B-4,

261
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,726
- so I just brought it in. Someone probably
forgot it.

262
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:29,265
Really? Can I rent it?

263
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,670
Are you sure you want this one?

264
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,262
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,439

you ...

269
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,868
You, who saw these images,

270
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,866
- have seven days left.

271
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,653
Seven days later at this time, you will die.

272
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,162
If you don't want to die, then...

273
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,328
Hello?

274
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,225
Hello?

275
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:12,005
It's a lie!

276
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:32,030
This is a joke...

277
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,085
It's a lie!

278
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,381
This is one for the books!

279
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,021
What's so funny?

280
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,385
This is just like you. Thinking this would be a big
story, you jumped on it -

281
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,757
-but nobody else thinks so. So you research it
all by yourself.

282
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:34,387
Now you think your life is in danger and you're
completely freaked out.

283
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,660
Four people have already died!

284
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,895
Why don't you show that tape to everyone? It
would be hilarious.

285
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:46,169
Everyone would start working to figure out the
missing part of the tape.

286
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,447
Wouldn't you rather do that than be alone?

287
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,812
Takayama!

288
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:56,046
I'm just kidding. Well... Since I'm like a bad
omen to you,

289
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:01,053
-this must be something for you to come here.

00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,600
PARAPS YCHOLOGY/CLAIRVOYANCE

00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,702
Head Doctor: Ryuji Takayama

292
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:34,254
So, let me watch the video. I'll even put it into
my collection.

293
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,622
Are you sure?

294
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,758
You'll die if you see it ...

295
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,563
Yeah, whatever. The fear that you felt when you
watched this video...

296
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:58,547
If we decipher the psyche, then maybe we'll be
able to understand the structure of this strange
world.

297
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,548
Wow... is it already that time?

298
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:12,824
I have to go show these idiots my supreme
lecture.

299
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,556
Takayama?

300
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,831
Copy it onto this one. You can figure out how to
do it.

301
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:23,338
After I'"m done I'll just leave the copy here.

302
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:29,477
Yeah, I'll watch it as soon as I can. While you're
alive...

303
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,130
Hey, Asakawa!

304
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,529
Since you've been gone, everyone has had their
hands full.

305
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,599
Its been two days. You're being lazy! Show
some remorse.

306
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,040
Sorry,

307
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,284
I shouldn't have gone to see someone like Ryuji
Takayama.

308
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:12,546
Maybe I'm into my own assumption

309
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:18,327
Then this tape is just a prank?

310
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,068
I'm home.

311
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,464
Welcome home!

312
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,203
Sorry about last night.

313
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:36,472
Hey, Kazuyuki, are you still seeing that
Takayama?

314
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,842
Why?

315
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,846
He called a few times

316
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,658
Kazuyuki!

317
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:51,992
It's okay, I'm just going to tell him to stop getting
involved.

318
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,267
Hello, this is Asakawa.

319
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,502
It's me. Can you come here right now?

320
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,405
The video I got from you ...

321
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,909
it's a forewarning message to commit murder.

322
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:17,279
If we leave this as it is, we might actually be
dead in a week...

323
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,057
No fucking way!

324
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,554
I don't have any real assurance...

325
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,191
How do you know?

326
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:31,602
A hunch. And I've never been wrong about this
kind of thing.

327
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,196
You should know the most about this. Hurry up
and come over.

328
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,705
You've got six days to live, and I've got seven.

329
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,206
There is a way to be saved.

330
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,296
What do we have to do?

331
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,801
Firstly, who is the one who erased the end of
this tape?

332
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:48,980
Maybe it was one of the four? The program that
was recorded at the end was aired the night they
stayed in Hakone ...

333
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,710
Those kids tried to freak out the people who saw
the tape next -

334
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:58,846
-and half jokingly erased the important part of
the message ...

335
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,855
Then there are probably more than those four
that have seen this tape.

336
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,366
And those people would know how to be saved.

337
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,359
Yeah...

338
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,999
Find out about everyone else that stayed in that
room.

339
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,515
Good evening.

340
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:27,909
Hello.

341
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,278
She's a student from the university.

342
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,785
Sensei, should I make some coffee?

343
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:45,731
I guess I'll tell you the reason I think this video is
for real.

344
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:54,438
This footage, for something that's manufactured,
it's really good.

345
00:36:55,112 --> 00:37:02,575
It could be a pro, and in reality there are four
people dead.

346
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:11,055
But the contents are very sporadic. I feel
sometimes though...

347
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:11,992
What?

348
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,588
Some abnormal power.

349
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,634
..it's gone into the world you dislike.

350
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,140
However, we should approach this in a realistic,
logical way

351
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,508
This video has two main overall points.

352
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:49,155
'"If you keep shomon, the bokon will come for
you,'"

353
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:55,235
- this is some old Japanese dialect. I'll ask a
linguist about it.

354
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,942
Next, there's the clip of the volcano.

355
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,076
Find out where this volcano is and when it
erupted.

356
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,083
Can we solve it this way?

357
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,722
We won't know until we try.

358
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:17,817
Wait a second...we might die!

359
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,858
Are you scared of dying?

360
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,958
Of course!

361
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,099
We lose everything if we die.

362
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,703
Really? Have you died before?

363
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,975
Of course I haven't!

364
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,068
I'm the only one who can help you.

365
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,207
If you want to live, then listen to what I say.

366
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,482
We've started down a road, which we can never
come back from.

367
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:50,386
I took days off of work, told my wife I was going
to work and started our investigation.

368
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:57,428
According to the innkeeper, it was one month
ago that the video deck was installed in that
cabin.

369
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,934
Since then, there were eight groups that stayed
there.

370
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,700
I called them individually and asked if they had
seen a weird video.

371
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,077
But none of them knew about it.

372
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,979
One by one, I erased their names.

373
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:23,790
The old lady's regional Japanese, it's from the
lzu-Oshima Island.

374
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,892
Yes, from Oshima. There's also a southern
accent included in it -

375
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,436
- from Sashikiji prefecture.

376
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,797
Izu-Oshima island?

377
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,941
Well, the volcano is Mt. Mihara, from the lzu-
Oshima.

378
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,339
And the meaning of the old lady's words...

379
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:49,775
'"How has your health been since then?

380
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:55,751
'"If you just keep playing in water - '"

381
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,395
'" - monsters are going to come for you.'"

382
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:09,939
And finally, we found out that the last people that
stayed in that room didn't know about the video.

383
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:17,838
We don't have a chance unless we solve this
mystery ourselves.

384
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,617
Five more days.

385
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,130
Four more days.

386
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,442
Three more days.

387
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:04,353
If I die, will my wife be able to survive on her
own?

388
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,660
And what will become of my child,

389
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,029
who will never see their father's face?

390
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,164
Time is the only thing passing, which is as fast
as it's cruel.

391
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,754
The black frames...

392
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,760
Yeah, I watched in slow motion and realized it
for the first time.

393
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,127
They're really instant, but it also happens
multiple times.

394
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,269
Yeah, it was on my mind also ...

395
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,534
All right, lets organize this.

396
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,302
The naked baby lying down: one.

397
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,534
The man with the bleeding shoulder: five.

398
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,677
These are all the black frames, that I counted.

399
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,205
What do you think of all this?

400
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,576
There are some parts with the black frames, and
some without them.

401
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,350
The ones with the black frames, are the volcano
eruption -

402
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,716
- the baby, -

403
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,120
- the man, -

404
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,257
- and this other man...

405
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,216
That's it ...

406
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,081
That's exactly it!

407
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,117
Only the concrete parts, which are memories of
actual events, have the black frames.

408
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,985
And the black frames occur on average about
once every three or four seconds.

409
00:43:56,033 --> 00:44:01,164
Do you get it? It's the blinking of a human eye.

410
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:02,772
Blinking?

411
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,668
Yeah.

412
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:10,172
Wait a minute, this is a video! Why would it
have anything to do with blinking?

413
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:16,448
So this footage is not something recorded with a
camera.

414
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:17,854
What?

415
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,982
lts a materialization of human will?

416
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,492
A materialization of human will?

417
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,756
This is someone burning their memory onto the
tape.

418
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,891
And their grudge, too.

419
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,163
A very strong curse.

420
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:39,576
What!? Something like that couldn't happen!

421
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,668
It does happen!!

422
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,807
Materialization is a life force, which contains
energy and is an element.

423
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,582
Modern science has philosophized this.

424
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:57,484
So it means we have to find whoever made this
as quickly as possible, and release the grudge.

425
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:01,490
How do we find this? I don't have a clue!

426
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,401
For someone that could create,

427
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,628
- materialization like this had to have been
recorded in some form.

428
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,038
Wait...

429
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,172
Izu-Oshima

430
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,806
NEVER SEEN BEFORE!
DEMONSTRATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF
CLAIRVO YANCE

431
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:25,854
For this organized event, we have people from
all different subjects of study.

432
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,393
A man, who strongly believes he has found the
existence of clairvoyance -

433
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:37,266
Professor Heihachiro lkuma, is in front of these
examining scientists.

434
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,731
The outcome of dice, thrown into a special lead
container,

435
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:47,676
will be predicted by Shizuko Yamamura,

436
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:53,072
using her power of clairvoyance in this
demonstration.

437
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,584
But no matter how many times she tried,

438
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,455
-she couldn't guess the number on the dice.

439
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:06,629
The crowd, who attended the experiment,
became disgusted at her failure

440
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,855
- and started yelling. They left their seats,

441
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:16,904
-and some of them even started throwing things.

442
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:25,311
Assistant Professor lkuma's reputation was
seriously hurt.

443
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,720
But she failed the experiment! How could she
be a clairvoyant?

444
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,088
Well ... there's a newspaper article left.

445
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,363
The reason Shizuko Yamamura got discovered
was through her power of clairvoyance.

446
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,264
She saw through all these statues.

447
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,268
The the one who made the video is Shizuko
Yamamura.

448
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:49,635
No, no, no...

449
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,537
- the daughter. Who we need to find is Sadako
Yamamura.

450
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:59,174
Heihachiro lkuma and Shizuko Yamamura had a
daughter.

451
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,541
How do you know that?

452
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,446
Look at this video.

453
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,818
This is the eye level of a child.

454
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,234
At that time Sadako was 8 years old.

455
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:22,494
If the mother had the power of clairvoyance,
there's a very good chance -

456
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:26,400
the daughter had psychic abilities too.

457
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,535
You're saying that Shizuko Yamamura had real
powers?

458
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,584
Yes, but the powers her daughter Sadako had
were even stronger.

459
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:39,216
That's why she's able to make images on tape,
and even kill somebody.

460
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:49,088
All right, let's fly to Oshima tomorrow. Sadako's
relatives might still be alive.

461
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,003
This is getting to be quite entertaining.

462
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,536
What's wrong?

463
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,279
Sorry, but I'm not going.

464
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,550
What?

465
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,315
This isn't a game!

466
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,124
The only time I have left is tommorow and the
next day.

467
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,318
Only two days left!

468
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:20,093
If that's the case, I want to spend that time with
my wife.

469
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,361
Excuse me.

470
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,226
Wait a second.

471
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,903
Asakawa!? Are you sure you want to do that!?

472
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,039
I'm home.

473
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,280
Welcome home.

474
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,683
What happened, you're early today?

475
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,676
I thought you were going to be late for the next
few days.

476
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:48,747
Oh, the rotation changed a bit. Anyways, here...

477
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,463
What...what's the occasion?

478
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,491
It doesn't have to be an occasion to get you a
present.

479
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,732
I thought it'd look good on you. It's a summer
sweater.

480
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,137
I'm so happy! Can I open it?

481
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,500
Yeah, of course.

482
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:33,358
Hey Shizuka! Did you ...

483
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,499
Oh sorry, it was in the VCR so ...

484
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,865
That gross video.

485
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,004
You saw it?

486
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,536
Yeah what is it?

487
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,183
When did you see it?!

488
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,180
When did you see it!?

489
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:55,516
This afternoon, after I got home from the
hospital so a little past 2 pm ...

490
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,729
Idiot!

491
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,728
What happened?

492
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,768
lzu-Oshima Island

493
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,952
Mt. Mihara

494
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,283
It's all my fault.

495
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,181
Since I rushed into this big story, now even my
wife is involved!

496
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:32,821
You and I will be saved! So your wife will be
saved too.

497
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,726
Why do you have so much confidence?

498
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:52,274
It might be all over for us, haven't you thought of
that?

499
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,551
Maybe you don't understand,

500
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:01,580
but there's a mystery and a depth of this video
that I'm attracted to.

501
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,587
I think we'll definitely meet the creator of this
video.

502
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,865
The Yamamura house was a well known
household in this area.

503
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,367
There is still a cousin of Shizuko Yamamura
living here.

504
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,875
YAMAMURA

505
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,696
Are you Mr. Yamamura?

506
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:23,096
Shizuko is dead. She threw herself into Mt.
Mihara and died.

507
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,736
It all happened long ago.

508
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:35,986
Shizuko saw a lot of terrible things.

509
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:42,687
she often complained about having a headache
and was bedridden.

510
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,829
That Heihachiro lkuma used her as a tool to
make money!

511
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:53,834
And he wanted a wife and child

512
00:52:55,939 --> 00:53:00,899
so he got Shizuko pregnant!

513
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,144
Is that child Sadako?

514
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:13,288
Yes it is. Shizuko went crazy from being shown
off in front of crowds.

515
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:18,822
and even her second child died soon after
birth ...

516
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:22,189
She came back from Tokyo as if she escaped
from there.

517
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:30,104
She left Sadako and jumped into the volcano!

518
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,510
After that, Sadako was left all alone.

519
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:48,647
She possesed even stranger powers than her
mother.

520
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:55,321
Because of that, she was tormented a lot when
she was young.

521
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,239
Do you know what happened to Sadako after
that?

522
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:12,740
She said she was leaving and she escaped off
the island -

523
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,645
- saying she was going to be an actress.

524
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,418
She was in an acting troupe called '"Hisho.'" Or
something like that -

525
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,059
- but I don't know what happened after that...

526
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:35,961
She was a beautiful girl, she was probably
tricked by some pervert.

527
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:46,741
Asakawa! Where the hell are you?

528
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,647
You're absent without permission. The entire
office is pissed off.

529
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,146
I'm sorry, but I need something looked up...

530
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:57,916
About 30 years ago, there should have been
someone named Sadako Yamamura -

531
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:01,697
in an acting group called Hisho. Can you look
up what she's doing now?

532
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:07,199
And the assistant Professor at Taido University,
named Heihachiro lkuma ...

533
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:12,097
Iook up the disappearance of this man too. I'm
counting on you.

534
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:04,290
It's a nice bath. You should take one too.

535
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:15,567
Well then, let's eat something.

536
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,663
What's the matter?

537
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,192
Tommorow at this time, right?

538
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:53,975
Tomorrow at this time I might die.

539
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,244
Why are you so discouraged?

540
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,151
You wouldn't understand, Takayama.

541
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:15,924
Even after I die, you still have fourteen hours
left.

542
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,303
Don't give me that bullshit!

543
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,931
Right now fourteen hours is a long time!!

544
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,566
Knock it off

545
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,177
Knock it off, idiot

546
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,410
Twenty-four hours left.

547
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,375
The goal of this game is in our sight!

548
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:45,794
Anyway, go back to Tokyo tommorow morning,
and gather information about Sadako.

549
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:52,326
Believe me! Once you lose hope, you've lost the
game.

550
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,473
Understand?

551
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:13,922
With Yoshino's report, I found a former member
of the Hisho acting troupe from back then.

552
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,934
Excuse me, are you Arima?

553
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:36,436
Were you ever in an acting troupe? An acting
group called Hisho...

554
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,342
Yeah..

555
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,210
Do you remember a Sadako Yamamura

556
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,510
Sadako Yamamura...

557
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,384
Can you remember anything?

558
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,021
She was supposedly in the acting group around
the same time...

559
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,558
It was a long time ago ...

560
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,489
Can you wait here for a second?

561
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,664
Why are you running away?

562
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,101
Let me go!

563
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,473
I have nothing to do with it! I am of no use for
the police!

564
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:15,878
I'm not the police!!

565
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,977
I'm a newspaper reporter. I just came to ask a
little bit about the past.

566
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,419
Sorry about that.

567
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,685
We were getting a lot of heat from the police.

568
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,724
More than 30 years ago ...

569
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,193
Sadako Yamamura

570
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:36,632
She was a beautiful woman.

571
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,609
Like something so pure,

572
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,071
nothing you'd ever find in Tokyo...

573
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,346
But she just wasn't normal ...

574
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:48,850
'"Hey'"

575
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,783
Shigemori, who was in the group at the same
level I was -

576
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,721
- started saying he was going to make Sadako
his girlfriend

577
00:59:55,959 --> 01:00:00,328
So we went to Sadako's house one late night,
then ...

578
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,989
'"Is that Sadako's voice?'"

579
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,979
Then we saw there was someone there before
us ...

580
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:48,842
Sadako called out to the other person ...

581
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,775
What do you think she said?

582
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:52,815
'"Father'"

583
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,287
Father?

584
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:05,921
Yeah ... If that was it, the police wouldn't have
been so involved.

585
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,656
But the story doesn't end here.

586
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:17,733
Sighemori went crazy after seeing them ...

587
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,103
He said something like,

588
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,745
'"There's no way she could do it with her father
and not with me!'"

589
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:28,875
After that he rushed to Sadako's apartment.

590
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,321
What the hell ...that guy did ...

591
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,920
then I will too ... Sadako!

592
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:38,491
And then?

593
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,456
Shigemori died ...

594
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:43,930
Died?

595
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,899
Sudden heart failure.

596
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:49,767
Heart failure?

597
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,887
Hello?

598
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,048
I saw the son of Heihachiro lkuma.

599
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:15,052
Yeah ... Heihachiro fell physically ill, but his
doctor, Nagao, lives in Atami.

600
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,833
ATAMI

601
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,629
Excuse me, is Dr. Jotaro Nagao here?

602
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,198
Are you here for an examination?

603
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,129
No ...

604
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,112
Are you Dr. Jotaro Nagao?

605
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:13,885
Yes.

606
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,325
Sadako Yamamura ... You know her don't you?

607
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:26,394
Hey you -

608
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,499
what did you do to her?

609
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,345
Sadako ...

610
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,922
It was over 30 years ago.

611
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:59,632
She was the daughter of Heihachiro lkuma, who
was a patient of mine

612
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,512
My father ... he's not going to make it, is he?

613
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,222
He's going to die soon, isn't he?

614
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,964
I was wellll aware that Sadako shared an intimate
rellationship with her father.

615
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:38,237
But even though I felt sorry for her, I didn't think
she was tainted.

616
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,101
Later, I was suddenly attracted to the purity of
Sadako's heart.

617
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,838
And eventually, Sadako thought about me too ...

618
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:52,152
We never brought it to words, but we were in
love.

619
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,487
Until that incident ...

620
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,811
'"No, we can't drink this water.

621
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:31,690
'"Sadako ...'"

622
01:05:56,085 --> 01:06:02,251
'"No, no, no!'"

623
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,257
Sadako, I love you... Sadako ...

624
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,353
Is it true? You really love me?

625
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,697
I love you. I even want to marry you!

626
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:46,558
No matter what? You will marry me?

627
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,234
No matter what. I'll marry you.

628
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,930
Sadako was not a woman, nor a man.

629
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,728
She was a hermaphrodite.

630
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,774
Hermaphrodite?

631
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:35,677
She had Testicular Feminization Sydrome, to be
exact.

632
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:53,557
I thought so. You're all the same ...

633
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:55,494
No

634
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,145
I'll kill you

635
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,346
Sadako's voice echoed in my head.

636
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,147
I'll kill you...

637
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,226
Then suddenly in my chest!

638
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,887
I'll kill you!

639
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:25,528
I'll kill you!

640
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:29,768
I'll kill you!

641
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,046
Stop it Sadako!

642
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,758
I thought about it over and over.

643
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:02,563
I'm innocent, truly innocent. Believe me.

644
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:05,534
She possesed me to commit murder!

645
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,869
She made me do it!

646
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,043
Then you're the murderer!

647
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:17,584
Nagao? Tell us one last thing.

648
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:21,380
The hospital you worked in, where was it located
back then?

649
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,227
Fujimi town in Hakone.

650
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,854
The town's name might be changed by now,
though ...

651
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,528
Fujimi town in Hakone?

652
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:43,575
Here! It's here! Right were the cabin I saw the
video tape in is!

653
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,274
Then it's true

654
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,249
The cabin was built right where the hospital was.

655
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,055
Under the floor there's a ...

656
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:57,250
... there's a place where Sadako sleeps now.

657
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,230
We'll pull Sadako out of the well and then give
her remains a proper burial.

658
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:05,530
That is the only way left for us who have seen
the video ...

659
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,066
There's still more that I don't understand.

660
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:12,296
What?

661
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:17,036
Why did Sadako have an intimate relationship
with her father?

662
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:24,114
Nah, the initimacy with her father is not the
problem.

663
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:31,727
The problem is that she was born with the
disgust of all the beautiful things -

664
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,093
- which make us human.

665
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:39,130
It doesn't seem strange to me that the two
longed for eachother -

666
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:43,235
after they were both abandoned by society.

667
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:07,059
Why do you think Sadako went on to murder
everyone without motive like this?

668
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:13,099
Normally, wouldn't she take revenge on the one
who did this to her?

669
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:16,361
I think in the span of her life of less than 20
years,

670
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:21,031
she felt more pain and misery than any person
could imagine.

671
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:26,536
That's why she takes all that in, covers herself,

672
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,879
sits with mostrous rage and sleeps in that well.

673
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:33,154
That's what I think.

674
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,775
where's the room where you watched the video?

675
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:31,711
Right there

676
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:44,690
Hurry Up!

677
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:24,730
Takayama!

678
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,060
It's right there!

679
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,378
What are you doing?

680
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:39,645
Bring the crowbar.

681
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:55,023
Hey ... try to break this right here.

682
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,750
Hey! Light!

683
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,427
We have to hurry up and stop Sadako from
doing this.

684
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,662
That's the answer to the problem.

685
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:36,131
All right then, I'm lowering myself below, so stay
up here and pull the bucket out.

686
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,869
You got it?

687
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,334
I understand.

688
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,962
Are you sure this is all right, Takayama?

689
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,329
And you, are you all right?

690
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,428
Make sure you're okay!

691
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:12,806
Yes, yes.

692
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,237
So let's go.

693
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:54,872
Are you all okay, Takayama?

694
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:59,021
Yeah ... it's pretty deep ...

695
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,147
Be careful.

696
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:43,966
That almost hit me!

697
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,058
I'm sorry.

698
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:03,978
What's the matter?

699
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,088
Switch.

700
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:11,883
Let's switch.

701
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:18,131
Wait a second. I can't bear to do this.

702
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,262
What the hell are you saying?

703
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:24,871
Don't get all touchy. You don't even have any
strength left to lift the bucket.

704
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,104
Look at the watch! How much time do you think
we have left?

705
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:30,541
Get ahold of yourself! Asakawa!

706
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:32,776
Yes.

707
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,578
Damn it!

708
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,955
We don't have time!

709
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:47,323
Be careful!

710
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,518
Are you okay!?

711
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:29,934
Don't worry, I'll be right here.

712
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,373
I'm all right!

713
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,127
Sadako!

714
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,344
Asakawa!!

715
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,768
Takayama ...

716
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:03,015
Takayama.

717
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,482
I'm awake ...

718
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,482
what the ...

719
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,528
It's over

720
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:23,300
Doctor?

721
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:25,872
Dr. Nagao?

722
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:32,713
NOOOO!!

723
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,071
Yeah, really?

724
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:04,744
The old man took it in silence?

725
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:06,836
That's good.

726
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:12,844
Yeah, as soon as I showed him the ashes he
knew what it was.

727
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:18,182
But he didn't take the video. He told me to
'"erase it, please.'"

728
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,354
Yeah, so that's that.

729
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:26,395
Good, then shall we have a drink to celebrate
us coming out alive?

730
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:30,005
Yeah, that sounds good.

731
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:35,272
Then I'll catch the next flight to Haneda, how
about 2:30 at the bar in Haneda?

732
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:38,378
Then 2:30 it is. Got it.

733
01:23:58,767 --> 01:23:59,927
Ms. Sadako.

734
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:08,441
That's your child?

735
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,903
It's the thing you wanted most of all.

736
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:41,570
If you don't want to die, there's only one way to
live.

737
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,568
Your child.

738
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:18,437
Professor? Professor?

739
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:23,314
No, professor, no!

740
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:01,849
He's dead...

741
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,053
Why!?

742
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:16,401
No one knew him really ...

743
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:22,966
but he was a really good person.

744
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:27,809
I know. I knew him very well...

745
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:38,586
He never slept with me, but we were doing very
well...

746
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:45,458
Hey ...

747
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:47,223
how did Takayama die?

748
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:50,966
Anything ... did you notice anything at all?

749
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:52,666
Anything!

750
01:26:55,843 --> 01:27:05,220
I don't know ... He said '"Your child,'" to himself.

751
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,881
Your child?

752
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:22,900
Why didn't we break Sadako's grudge?

753
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:28,206
Why?

754
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,011
I'm alive but ...

755
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:50,891
- You watched it!? -

756
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:52,696
- Yeah ... -

757
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:02,600
'"Your child?'"

758
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:10,649
Wait, wait. I did something Takayama didn't
do ...

759
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,518
What ... what is it?

760
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:19,950
What!

761
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:23,296
Child. Child.

762
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,091
Child.

763
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:30,602
- Make a copy of this, you can figure out how,
can't you? -

764
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:36,810
That's it!

765
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,678
That's it!

766
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:48,012
I copied the tape for Takayama and showed it to
him.

767
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,789
- So after I copy it , I can leave it here right? -

768
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:55,391
- Yeah. I'll watch it is as soon as I can. While
you're alive ... -

769
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:01,599
That's it!

770
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:14,337
Sadako was using the videotape to reproduce
her own grudge!

771
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:34,961
- If you don't want to die,

772
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:37,734
there's only one way to live:

773
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:54,780
Those who have seen this video must become a
servant that leads a new person to death. -

774
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,740
Lead one to death?

775
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:21,872
Shizuka needs to show someone else the
video?

776
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,179
That's how she can be saved?

777
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,150
Find another victim?

778
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:44,833
Takayama, in order to sever the connection of
Sadako's horrifying grudge, chose death ...

779
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:49,872
But I can't do that.

780
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:11,464
I am going to have my wife make a copy of the
tape and show it someone else.

781
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,527
And after that and after that ...

782
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:24,369
Then the human race will have to continue on
like this forever.

783
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:36,415
If and when this ring becomes severed ...

784
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:49,570
Then that's the real beginning of Sadako's
revenge.
