1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:06,104
#<i> We lay, my love and I </i>#

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:11,041
#<i> Beneath the weeping willow </i>#

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:15,342
#<i> But now alone I lie </i>#

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:19,942
#<i> And weep beside the tree </i>#

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:24,581
#<i> Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>#

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:29,185
#<i> By the tree
that weeps with me </i>#

7
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:33,356
#<i> Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>#

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:38,631
#<i> Till my lover returns to me </i>#

9
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:43,175
#<i> We lay, my love and I </i>#

10
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:48,043
#<i> Beneath the weeping willow </i>#

11
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:52,608
#<i> But now alone I lie </i>#

12
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:58,381
#<i> O willow, I die </i>#

13
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,392
#<i> O willow, I die #</i>#

14
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,604
All I want to do is save the children...

15
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,674
not destroy them.

16
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,607
More than anything,
I love children.

17
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,120
More than anything.

18
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,759
They need affection...

19
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,762
love...

20
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,662
someone who will
belong to them...

21
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,361
and to whom they will belong.

22
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,337
Miss Giddens,
may I ask you a somewhat personal question?

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,601
Do you have an imagination?

24
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,609
Oh!

25
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,236
Oh, yes,
I can answer that.

26
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,713
- Yes.
- Good.

27
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,013
Truth is very seldom understood
by any but imaginative persons...

28
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,280
and I want to be quite truthful.

29
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,289
I'm a bachelor...

30
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,791
but not, I might add,
a lonely one.

31
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,294
I spend a great deal
of time abroad.

32
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,559
And as for my London life,
well, it amuses me...

33
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:59,070
but it's not the sort of amusement
that one could suitably share with children.

34
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,003
In brief, Miss Giddens...

35
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,598
I am a very selfish fellow...

36
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,703
and the last man alive to be saddled
so suddenly and so awkwardly...

37
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,146
with two orphaned infants.

38
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,151
It's most unfortunate...

39
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,620
for I have no room for them,
neither mentally nor emotionally.

40
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,816
Does that seem quite heartless?

41
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,985
Honest, but not heartless.

42
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,196
Then the children
do not live with you?

43
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,631
No. They are at
my country estate in Bly.

44
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,135
A rather large,
rather lonely place.

45
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,900
Still, I'm sure you'll agree,
the country seems the proper thing for children.

46
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,466
I see from your letter that you are,
yourself, the daughter of a country parson...

47
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,274
and, um-
oh, yes, here it is-

48
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,349
"More than anything,
I love children."

49
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,147
- Yes.
- How remarkable.

50
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,154
For several years now...

51
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,156
little Miles and Flora-

52
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,385
Charming names,
don't you think-

53
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,394
have had only me.

54
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,659
Well, poor brats,
they need more than a distant uncle.

55
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,358
Well, of course they need
more than a governess.

56
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,367
They need affection and love...

57
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,428
and someone to whom they can belong
and who will belong to them.

58
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,541
You, Miss Giddens.

59
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,374
I feel that you are that person.

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,880
Sir, you-

61
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,214
you do realize that this
would be my first position.

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,220
What does that signify...

63
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,224
if I trust you,
if you trust me?

64
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,227
You see, Miss Giddens,
the person whom I engage...

65
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,322
must solemnly promise
to accept full and complete responsibility.

66
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,367
She must never trouble me.

67
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,369
Never. Never.

68
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,371
Neither complain
nor appeal nor write.

69
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,102
Simply take
the whole thing over and...

70
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,178
leave me alone.

71
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,248
What do you say, Miss Giddens?

72
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,445
The children, uh-

73
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,385
- Have they had a governess before?
- Unfortunately.

74
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,325
Not that there was anything wrong
with Miss Jessel.

75
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,329
She was an excellent governess
and a most respectable woman.

76
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,332
The children quite liked her,
especially little Flora.

77
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,461
Oh, which reminds me, be careful
not to broach that subject to Flora.

78
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,973
She was so fond
of Miss Jessel, and...

79
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,976
it did come
as an appalling shock.

80
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,979
- I'm not certain that I understand you, sir.

81
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,981
She died.

82
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,984
Yes,just when I thought
I'd got the whole situation settled...

83
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,316
and everything
running smoothly...

84
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,516
the confounded woman died.

85
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,185
It was all very odd.

86
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,694
I was in Calcutta
when it happened...

87
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,698
and have only now been able
to seek a replacement.

88
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,701
Meantime, my nephew had
to be sent off to school...

89
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,204
and the little girl, Flora, is being
chaperoned by my housekeeper...

90
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,706
Mrs. Grose.

91
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:54,178
Help me, Miss Giddens,
for truly I am helpless.

92
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,044
Give me your hand.

93
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,120
Give me your promise.

94
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,989
Well, sir...

95
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,150
if you are really sure-

96
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,161
Quite sure,
and very grateful.

97
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,323
Only remember,
you're in supreme authority.

98
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,597
Whatever happens,
you must handle it alone.

99
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,263
Yes, I'll try.

100
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,898
I promise you that.

101
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,410
I'll do everything I can
to keep the children happy.

102
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,495
Oh, stop. Please stop.!

103
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,932
- Whoa there.
- If you don't mind, I think
I'd like to walk from here.

104
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,162
As you wish, miss. Whoa.

105
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,446
Thank you.

106
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,255
Flora.!

107
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,495
Flora.!

108
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,804
Flora.!

109
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,153
Didn't you hear?
Someone is calling your name.

110
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,161
No, I don't think so.
I didn't hear anyone.

111
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,231
Isn't your name Flora?

112
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,333
I'm Miss Giddens.

113
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,596
Yes, I know.
You're my new governess.

114
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,605
I've been watching the road,
waiting for you.

115
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,938
- Are you afraid of reptiles?
- That rather depends. Why?

116
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,444
Because I've got one in my pocket,
and he's very eager to meet you.

117
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,015
Well, in that case,
by all means.

118
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,217
- His name is Rupert.

119
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,719
- Oh, a tortoise.
- We love each other.

120
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,849
- Yes, I can see that you're very close.
- Very.

121
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,086
There, now you've
met Miss Giddens.

122
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,186
But Rupert isn't the only one.

123
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,288
I mean, ever since
my uncle wrote...

124
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,799
we've all been waiting
and waiting for you to come.

125
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,801
Oh, we have been excited.

126
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,803
So have I.
I've been very excited indeed.

127
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,806
Not as excited as we have.
And not as excited as Mrs. Grose.

128
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,809
She's cleaned and cleaned
and had all the windows washed.

129
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,811
Just imagine-
1 34 windows!

130
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,882
- All that for me?
- Yes. And I helped!

131
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,548
- Oh, we will have fun together, won't we?
- Yes, we will, dear.

132
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,257
Oh, Mrs. Grose, she's here!
And she isn't afraid of reptiles.

133
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,887
And that's more than can be said of me,
isn't it? 

134
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,397
I walked from the gate.

135
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,401
I- I wanted to see it all.

136
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,404
I'm glad to see you, Miss Giddens.

137
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,565
Really, I'm glad.

138
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,575
Oh, do please come in.

139
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,645
Thank you.
You're very kind.

140
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,252
- Oh!
- Now, I expect you'd like a cup of tea.

141
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,585
- Thank you.
- But not you, Miss Flora.

142
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,354
Now, you know you're not allowed
in the house with that toad or turtle...

143
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,656
or whatever it is.

144
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,664
- Go on. Run along. Off you go.
- Oh, all right.

145
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,326
I had no idea.

146
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,700
I never imagined-

147
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,705
Oh, I'm so sorry.

148
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,935
That's all right, miss.
It's always happening.

149
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,476
I never imagined
it would be so beautiful.

150
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,482
Well, we do our best.

151
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,418
Though half the rooms are empty now-
locked and empty.

152
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,082
All the same, it's too big,
a job to keep clean.

153
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,593
But what I always say is,
it's a heaven for children.

154
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,595
Oh, yes, a heaven!

155
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,097
And what an enchanting child
she is.

156
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,100
There's not another like her.

157
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,103
Though, mind you, she has her ways.
You have your work cut out.

158
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,105
I don't doubt.

159
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,108
But she seems-
Well, she certainly looks angelic.

160
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,110
Well, she is too.

161
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,113
But she does like to wander,
to go off by herself.

162
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,116
- We're always hunting her.
- Oh, yes. I heard you.

163
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:36,120
Just now, as I was coming through the garden,
I heard you call her name.

164
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,122
Oh, not me, miss.

165
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,317
Perhaps it was Anna or Cook.

166
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,326
Well, someone.

167
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,828
Sit down, miss,
and have your tea.

168
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,330
Mmm, it'll be dark in here soon.

169
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,901
I'll get Anna
to bring some lamps.

170
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,805
Miss Giddens?

171
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,206
Miss Giddens! Has she gone?

172
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,278
Yes, for the moment.

173
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,878
You don't mind Rupert sharing a bit
of your cake, now, do you?

174
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,719
Watch out.
He'll grow too fat to fit your pocket.

175
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,884
- I have a pony too.
- Oh.

176
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,054
He isn't really mine.
He belongs to Miles.

177
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,224
Miles is my brother, you know.
He's away at school.

178
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,233
You must miss him very much.

179
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,997
Well, he'll be coming home soon.

180
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,506
Not, I should think,
until the holidays.

181
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:33,100
Time you went upstairs and got ready
for your bath, Miss Flora.

182
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,840
Promise, now, you won't go away.

183
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,076
I expect to be here
for a very long time.

184
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,627
And to think what qualms I had.

185
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,695
I was so afraid.

186
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,755
- Afraid, miss?
- I couldn't make up my mind.

187
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,335
Should I accept this post,
or shouldn't I?

188
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,337
Well, miss, I'm sure
I'm very glad you did.

189
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,532
After all,
I didn't have much choice.

190
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,939
Their uncle is most persuasive.

191
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,444
And don't I know it.

192
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,912
Many's the time
he's worked his magic on me.

193
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,916
Even when he was a boy
he could twist you around his finger...

194
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,316
and the children
are the same way.

195
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,055
He doesn't come down here
very often?

196
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,388
Well, he likes the town life.

197
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,552
He always was
a very popular gentleman.

198
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,563
And what's the good
of being popular down here...

199
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,634
with only the children
and the pigeons and me?

200
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,603
- Mrs. Grose?
- Yes, miss?

201
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,174
- What was she like?
- Who, miss?

202
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,436
The other governess.
The one who died.

203
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,945
Who, Miss Jessel?
Oh, she was a young woman.

204
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,948
Some thought her pretty,
and, well, I suppose she was.

205
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,143
But not as pretty as you, miss.

206
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,221
Not by half.

207
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,753
He seems to prefer them
young and pretty.

208
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,521
He did. He had
the devil's own eye-

209
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,530
I mean, that's his way,
the master's.

210
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,329
- But of whom did you speak first?
- Why, the master, of course.

211
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,960
There's nobody else, miss.
Nobody at all.

212
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,312
Be careful, dear, or you'll splash
Miss Giddens!

213
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,316
And is the other one just as remarkable?
Is he too as enchanting?

214
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,318
Well, if you like this one...

215
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,320
you should be quite carried away
by Master Miles.

216
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,322
Miles is coming!

217
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,325
I seem to be carried away quite easily.
That's what happened to me in London.

218
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,327
Miles is coming!
Miles is coming!

219
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,330
Stuff and nonsense.
You know very well Miles is at school.

220
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,798
- Now, hold still.

221
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,499
I've got a little bed in your room.
It's got curtains.

222
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,871
- How nice.
- Yes.

223
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,069
Mrs. Grose wanted
to give you a big room...

224
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,079
but I said,
"She'll only be there when she's asleep."

225
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:53,083
- Big rooms get bigger at night. Do you know that?
- Do they?

226
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,085
Mrs. Grose doesn't know.

227
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,382
She shuts her eyes in the dark.

228
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,889
I think that's silly.

229
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,825
- I always look in the dark.
- Do you?

230
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,828
And what do you see?

231
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,830
There are
a lot of empty rooms.

232
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:11,301
I said, to Mrs. Grose, "I wish there was
some way of sleeping in several rooms at once."

233
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,304
Mrs. Grose was quite
startled by the thought.

234
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,900
- I don't wonder!
- "Stuff and nonsense," she said.
"Stuff and nonsense."

235
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,687
Now I lay me down to sleep.

236
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,689
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep-

237
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,191
Why can't Rupert sleep with me?

238
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,694
Because you might roll over
and crush him.

239
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,696
Crush a tortoise?

240
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,698
Now finish your prayers, dear.

241
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,700
If I should wake before I-

242
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,703
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

243
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,705
Amen.

244
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,708
Miss Giddens, where would the Lord
take my soul to?

245
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,710
- To heaven.
- Are you certain?

246
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,713
Yes, of course,
because you're a very, very good girl.

247
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,715
But I might not be.

248
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,412
And if I weren't, wouldn't the Lord just
leave me here to walk around?

249
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,922
Isn't that what happens
to some people?

250
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,695
Whatever was that?

251
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,462
- I'm sure something's been hurt.

252
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,469
An animal.

253
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,199
We must pretend we didn't hear it.
That's what Mrs. Grose says.

254
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,409
- Pretend?
- Then we won't imagine things.

255
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:33,582
Sometimes one can't help...
imagining things.

256
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,781

- You should be outdoors on a day like this.

263
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,525
I was just practicing, Mrs. Grose.

264
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,528
- Have you seen Miss Giddens, my lamb?
- I'm out here, Mrs. Grose.

265
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,598
Oh!

266
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,133
There's some letters
for you, miss.

267
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,136
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, please, can I help you read them?

268
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,138
- Yes, if you like.
- Which first?

269
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,140
Now, how can I tell?

270
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,210
- Then I shall choose.
- All right.

271
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,548
Here.

272
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,618
This one's from my sister.

273
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,888
Oh, look, dear.

274
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,891
Here's a picture of me
and my family together.

275
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,894
- Am I in it?
- How could you be? It's of my family.

276
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,896
Oh.

277
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,898
- Now this one.
- It's from London.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,595
- Is it from my uncle?
- Yes, I think it is.

279
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,695
You do look pleased.

280
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,203
Is he coming to see us?

281
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,610
No, dear. He's sent me a letter
from Miles's school.

282
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,665
- Flora?
- Yes, Miss Giddens, dear?

283
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,668
Didn't you say last night
that Miles was coming home?

284
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,670
Oh, look.

285
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,672
It's a lovely spider...

286
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,742
and it's eating a butterfly.

287
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,442
Mrs. Grose?

288
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,455
Here's a letter their uncle
has forwarded without opening.

289
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,457
It's from Miles's school.

290
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,392
He just wrote on the envelope,
"Am off to Italy for the summer.

291
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,896
This is from Miles's headmaster.
Deal with it without bothering me."

292
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,196
- That's just his way, miss.
- But how am I to deal with it?

293
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,463
Miles has been dismissed
from school.

294
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,199
- Dismissed?
- Sent home.

295
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,003
Expelled.

296
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,011
But what has he done?
What do the gentlemen say?

297
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,173
They go into no detail.
They simply say-

298
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,183
Here. Read it.

299
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,253
Read it for yourself.

300
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,256
It's no good, miss.
I never learned.

301
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,986
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.

302
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,430
They say that it is impossible
to keep him.

303
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,432
Why?

304
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,434
That he is...

305
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,436
an injury to the others.

306
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,439
Master Miles?
Him, an injury?

307
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,441
Oh, stuff and nonsense.

308
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,444
You might as well think ill
of Miss Flora, bless her.

309
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,947
- You've never known him to be bad?
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.

310
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,450
You mean
you like a boy with spirit.

311
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,020
Well, so do I,
but not to the degree to...

312
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,021
contaminate.

313
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,091
To what?

314
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,493
To corrupt.

315
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,495
Master Miles?

316
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,226
Oh, miss, are you afraid he'll corrupt you?

317
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,173
Miles is coming.! Miles is coming.!
Miles is coming.!

318
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,306
Bly.! Bly station.!

319
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,952
Miles! Miles!

320
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,521
Miles.

321
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,388
- You're Miss Giddens, aren't you?
- Yes.

322
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,121
How do you do?

323
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,764
Oh, thank you, Miles.

324
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,233
She's our new governess, Miles,
and she's awfully nice.

325
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,304
I hope Miles will agree.

326
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,301
- Come on.

327
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,749
Nothing's changed.

328
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,752
Oh, I've been longing
for these holidays.

329
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,254
Holidays?

330
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,621
Longing to see Bly
and Mrs. Grose and Flora.

331
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,492
And you. Flora wrote
and told me you were coming.

332
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,900
Did you have
a good term at school?

333
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,334
Look, Miles!
There's the lake!

334
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,872
Oh, it is nice to be back.

335
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,999
I hope you won't be lonely...

336
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,078
with just Flora
and Mrs. Grose and me.

337
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,310
Were you happy at school?

338
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,422
May I tell you something?

339
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,685
Yes, Miles, of course.

340
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:51,923
I think you're far too pretty
to be a governess.

341
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,727
And I think you're far too young to be
such a deceitful flatterer.

342
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,880
- Dearest Mrs. Grose!

343
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:15,385
- It is nice to be home.
- Stop! Stop! You'll have me out of breath!

344
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,887
It's all just the same.

345
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,891
Somehow- I don't know-
I was afraid it might be different.

346
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,393
Oh, nothing ever changes here,
Master Miles.

347
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,397
You look a bit thin, though.
We'll have to fatten you up.

348
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,729
Oh, Miles,
you haven't seen the pony!

349
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,735
- May we?
- Yes, of course!

350
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,805
Come on!

351
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,943
Well, miss?

352
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,606
It's just as you said.
Charm seems to run in the family.

353
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,876
And that cruel letter?

354
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,043
It must be a misunderstanding,
a mistake.

355
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,053
Yes, a mistake.

356
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,555
So, uh, what will you say
to Master Miles?

357
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,557
I shall have it out with him
later on.

358
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,559
That can't be avoided.
But not now.

359
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,062
I'm not going to spoil his homecoming
because of some silly schoolteacher.

360
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,996
Oh, yes, miss.

361
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,558
Oh, I- I'm so thankful
we're not to have trouble.

362
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:12,031
Dear Mrs. Grose,
what a comfort you are.

363
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,459
Why don't you come in, Miss Giddens.

364
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,692
How did you know
I was there?

365
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,964
This is a very old house.
Things creak.

366
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,768
And anyway, I saw the light
from your candle under the door.

367
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,843
You should be asleep.

368
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,845
- I'm much too excited.
- Excited?

369
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,245
By being home. By seeing Flora.

370
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,452
And meeting you.

371
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,754
Besides, I like to lie awake.

372
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,756
That's a very bad habit, Miles.

373
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,190
- Is it?
- Yes.

374
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,695
What do you think about
while you're lying awake?

375
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,197
Oh, a world
of different things.

376
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,200
And tonight...

377
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,702
were you, perhaps,
thinking about school?

378
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,773
Oh, no. All that
seems very far away.

379
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,942
Miles...

380
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,810
you do know that you will not be
allowed to go back.

381
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,217
You realize that it is
a very serious matter...

382
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,288
for a boy to be expelled
from school.

383
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,225
I can't think
what your uncle will say.

384
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,227
Can't you?
I can.

385
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,059
He'll say, "Don't bother me.
I'm too busy."

386
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,565
- Miles, that's not true.
- Isn't it?

387
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,568
You've met him, haven't you?
You know what he's like.

388
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,070
He doesn't care
about me or Flora.

389
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,074
He doesn't care
what happens to us.

390
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,077
Miles, dear,
you mustn't believe that.

391
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,511
Your uncle has-

392
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:01,279
Well, he has... a great many responsibilities
and not enough time-

393
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,479
To waste any on us?

394
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,079
I understand.

395
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,091
It's a bit sad though...

396
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,094
when people
don't have time for you.

397
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,164
Oh, I have, Miles.

398
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,033
I have time.

399
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,037
And I care.

400
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,371
And, Miles, if there's something
wrong about school...

401
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,446
if there's something
you want to tell me-

402
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,845
Miles, dear Miles...

403
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,284
can't you see that
I want to help you?

404
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,256
Trust me.

405
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,398
The candle's gone out.

406
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:57,032
Don't be frightened. It was only the wind,
my dear. The wind blew it out.

407
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,977


408
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:07,279
#<i> Beneath a weeping willow </i>#

409
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:11,879
#<i> But now alone I lie </i>#

410
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,324
#<i> And weep beside the tree </i>#

411
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,522
#<i> Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>#

412
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,223
#<i> By the tree </i>#

413
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,892
#<i> That weeps with me </i>#

414
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,272
#<i> Singing "O Willow Waly"</i>#

415
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,308
#<i> Till my lover returns-</i>#

416
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,071
- #</i>#

417
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,544
- # We lay, my love and I </i>#

418
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:17,212
#<i> Beneath a weeping willow </i>#

419
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:21,418
#<i> But now alone I lie </i>#

420
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:27,060
#<i> O willow, I die </i>#

421
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,726
#<i> O willow, I die #</i>#

422
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,972
Miles.

423
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,407
How long have you been here?

424
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,411
I don't know-
20 minutes, half an hour.

425
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,607
- Oh, then you must have seen him.
- Who?

426
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:55,015
The man who was
standing here on the tower.

427
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,021
I've been quite alone,
except for my greedy friends.

428
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,954
Well, that can't be true.

429
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,960
Not two minutes ago
I saw a man standing exactly here.

430
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,962
Perhaps it was me.

431
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,032
No, no, it was a man.

432
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,158
He was looking at me.

433
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,203
I expect you imagined it.

434
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,204
Or else- Oh, dear.

435
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,706
I hope you won't have to
wear spectacles.

436
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,709
You're much too pretty for that.

437
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,711
Oh, yes, I expect I'm tired.

438
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,713
I haven't been sleeping well.

439
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,715
I know.

440
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,717
Flora told me.

441
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,720
She says you make
little groans and moans all night.

442
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,723
Of course, one can
never believe Flora.

443
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,226
She invents things,
imagines them.

444
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,559
You mean, like poor,
silly Miss Giddens?

445
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,948
Miss, would these,
by any chance, be yours?

446
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,884
Scissors. The gardener brought them up.
He said he found them in the garden.

447
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,889
I must have dropped them this morning
when I-whilst I was cutting roses.

448
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,891
And just left them there.

449
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,393
I'm afraid today
isn't altogether my day.

450
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,896
I seem to be
at sixes and sevens.

451
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,899
Well, miss,you've never been away
from home before.

452
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,901
A strange place,
new responsibilities.

453
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,904
- Takes a bit of getting used to-
- Mrs. Grose.

454
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,907
Is there anyone living here
that I don't know about?

455
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,410
- Living here?
- In the house, I mean.

456
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,415
I've met the two maids, the cook
and her husband, the gardener...

457
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,918
and I was just wondering
if there was someone I hadn't met.

458
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,421
Bless you, miss, I wish there were.
We could use another pair of hands.

459
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:39,691
- Oh, hurry.! Do come.!

460
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,125
- Oh, hurry.! Do come.!

461
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,127
You must see!
Miles is giving an "expedition!"

462
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,198
Oh, come! You must see!
He's awfully brave!

463
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,918
Miles!

464
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,360
Flora, watch me.!

465
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,159
- Miles!

466
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,674
Miles?

467
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,902
I didn't know you were watching.

468
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,311
That was very clever, Miles.

469
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,599
Do look, Miss Giddens.
I can draw too.

470
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,671
Miles isn't the only one
who can draw.

471
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,806
Oh, yes.
Now I see.

472
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,342
It's lovely.
A vase of flowers.

473
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,345
Goodness, no.
It's a thunderstorm.

474
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,348
- See the clouds and the lightning?
- Oh, yes, dear.

475
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,850
Yes, well, I'm sure
it's very original.

476
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,921
- Perhaps you'll grow up to be a famous artist.
- Did you hear that, Miles?

477
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,480
Yes, dear. But Miss Giddens
is merely being polite.

478
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:26,052
Tell me, Miss Giddens, what do you think
I might grow up to be?

479
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,961
Anything you want.

480
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,466
There's nothing
I want to be...

481
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,197
except what I am-
a boy living at Bly.

482
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:38,264
Oh, if only everything
could go on just as it is now.

483
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,677
I love this house.

484
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,679
Don't you, Miss Giddens?

485
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,681
It's very beautiful.

486
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,683
And so large.

487
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,346
I expect it's the biggest house
in England.

488
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,356
The whole world, actually.

489
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,426
Oh, hardly
the whole world, Flora.

490
00:34:55,526 --> 00:35:00,088
Your house, where you used to live-
was that a big house too?

491
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,029
No, it was very small,
I'm afraid.

492
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,432
- How small?
- Very, very small.

493
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,334
Too small for you
to have secrets?

494
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,669
Well, secrets were
a bit difficult.

495
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,539
- Not for long.

496
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:18,547
Secrets require a privacy
that our little home did not provide.

497
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,209
- Did you play games in your house?
- No.

498
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,914
We had to be quiet, usually,
because my father was preparing his sermon.

499
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:28,788
But if he went out, we'd play
hide-and-seek all over the house.

500
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,793
Oh, lovely!

501
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,795
- Let's do that!
- All right.

502
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,797
You hide, and I'll seek.

503
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,265
We can go all over the house,
can't we?

504
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,269
- Everywhere, I mean.
- Yes, I should think so.

505
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,775
Oh. Where are the children going?
It's their bedtime.

506
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,777
Yes, I know.

507
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,280
But I thought,just one little game
and then right to bed they'll go.

508
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,782
Oh, they've won you over, miss,
already, I can see.

509
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,785
They have indeed.

510
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,617
- I'm coming!

511
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,408
Anna?

512
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,516
Miss Giddens.!

513
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,270
#<i> 

514
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,196
- You'd never have found me
if I hadn't pounced on you!

515
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,789
- Did I frighten you?
- Yes, a bit.

516
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,425
- Now you're my prisoner.
- Oh, Miles!

517
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,629
- Let me go.
- Why?

518
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,172
- You're hurting me.
- Am I?

519
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,108
- Yes, Miles. Please let me go.
- But why?

520
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,476
- I told you. You're hurting me. Miles, I mean it.
- Do you?

521
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,482
- Oh,you've found it.! I've missed it so.
- #</i>#

522
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,484
Mrs. Grose must have
hidden it here.

523
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,487
- Now it's your turn to hide.
- Hurry! Run!

524
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,489
All right.

525
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,491
Now where?

526
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,552
- Oh, where shall I hide?
- Wherever you like. We'll count a hundred.

527
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,863
One, two, three...

528
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:28,735
four, five, six, seven, eight...

529
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,003
nine, 1 0, 1 1-

530
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:50,221


531
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,437
Miss Giddens.!

532
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,572
Where are you?

533
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,616
Miss? Miss Giddens?

534
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,759
Whatever are you
doing there, miss?

535
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,761
Heavens, child,
you're white as milk.

536
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,764
I saw him!
Don't tell me I didn't, because I did.

537
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,766
- I saw him staring.
- Who, miss?

538
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,268
- The same man- the man on the tower.
- The tower?

539
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,271
But now,just now, he was staring past me
into the house...

540
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,273
as if he were hunting someone.

541
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,775
- What's he like, miss?
- He had dark, curling hair.

542
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,278
- And the hardest, the coldest eyes.
- Is he-

543
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,781
- Would you say he was very handsome?
- Oh yes. Handsome and obscene.

544
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,943
But I've seen him before.
Yes, he-

545
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,886
I know where I've seen him.
A picture. There's a picture of him.

546
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,891
A miniature in a cracked glass
in the attic.

547
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,893
- I'll show you.
- It can't be.

548
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,225
- It can't be? You know him.
- Quint.

549
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,560
- Peter Quint, the master's valet.
- But you said-

550
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,999
Yes, miss. You see, he's dead.
Quint is dead.

551
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,003
Dead?

552
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,767
- #</i>#

553
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,658
Your pencil does have
the most terrible squeak, Flora.

554
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,669
It does, doesn't it?
But I can't help it, you know.

555
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,740
Can't you? I thought you were
doing it on purpose.

556
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,609
She is.

557
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,612
- Stop it! Stop begging!
- I'm not begging!

558
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,274
Yes, you are!
You're begging for attention!

559
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,285
- There you are, begging again.

560
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,787
First for attention,
now for affection.

561
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,289
- Stop it, Flora!
- Now, Miles. Hush, Miles.

562
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,987
Oh, darling.
Oh, poor darling Flora.

563
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,655
There, now.
Look, I've made you cry.

564
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,666
Oh, what a hateful,
what a grumpy old governess you have.

565
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,599
You're not grumpy at all.

566
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,604
Of course you're not.
Though I wouldn't wonder if you were.

567
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,606
Nor would I,
with everything so horrible.

568
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,108
- Horrible?

569
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,041
Why, yes.
You know, the rain.

570
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,774
Not being able
to go out in the garden.

571
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,783
My squeaky pencil and me-
I wasn't even trying to be good.

572
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,785
Oh, but you are good.

573
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,253
You both are.

574
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,256
I know what.

575
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,486
Let's put away our books
and let's pretend it's Flora's birthday.

576
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,995
- Oh, yes!
- All right, Flora, it's your birthday.

577
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,497
- What would you like to do?
- Have a party.

578
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,296
- A costume party.
- That's a splendid idea!

579
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,303
- Miles and I'll go get all dressed up.
- May we?

580
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,965
- Yes, of course you may.
- Come along then, Flora.

581
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,975
Oh, good.!

582
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,014
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Where are you going?

583
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,016
- To dress up! You said we might!
- Well, I'll come with you.

584
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,645
No! Then there'd be no surprise!
You wait downstairs! We won't be long!

585
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,723
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.!

586
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,430
I've let them go.

587
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,591
- Go where, miss?
- Oh!

588
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,999
Oh, I've let the children go.

589
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,937
Upstairs,
to the attic, perhaps.

590
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,940
- Alone.

591
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:09,035
- Is that all? They'll come to no harm.
- I can't.

592
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,047
I can't leave them alone,
not after the other night.

593
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,050
As for the other night, miss,
put it out of your mind.

594
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,553
- Pretend it was part of a dream,
which perhaps it was.
- A dream?

595
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,557
Don't you think
I want to believe that?

596
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,059
That it was just the darkness,
a nightmare?

597
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:28,222
But it's no longer dark.
It's daylight. And I know I saw him.

598
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,563
A man, or something
that once was a man...

599
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,105
peering in through the window,
looking for someone.

600
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:38,106
And if it isn't true,
if I didn't see him...

601
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,109
how could I have described him
so accurately?

602
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:44,442
Well,you had
seen his picture.

603
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:48,450
Really, miss, you're upsetting yourself
over nothing.

604
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,452
You said he was the valet?

605
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,454
Yes, but when the master left...

606
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,456
Quint was alone with us,
in charge.

607
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,459
Tell me, how did he die?

608
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,461
Quint?

609
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,396
Out there, miss,
on those very steps.

610
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,399
It was winter.

611
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,402
The coldest,
blackest winter's night.

612
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,404
The steps were icy.

613
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,407
Quint, he came home late,
after we were all abed.

614
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,409
Late, and full of drink.

615
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,412
There was a wound on his head,
as if he'd slipped...

616
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,642
as if he'd fallen
out there in the dark.

617
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,651
I can't forget his eyes.

618
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,881
They were open,
filled with surprise...

619
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:29,982
with pain, like the eyes of a fox
I once saw-

620
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,995
a fox the dogs had hunted down.

621
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,463
But it was an accident?

622
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,466
He was a peculiar man.

623
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,969
There were things in his life
that could account for violence done him...

624
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,971
vicious things-

625
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,406
Well, it doesn't do
to speak ill of the dead.

626
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,410
The children
never mention him?

627
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,640
Oh, no, miss, and neither must you-
not to them.

628
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,650
You see, miss, it was Master Miles
that found him.

629
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,652
Oh, that poor little boy.

630
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,654
If you could have
heard his screams...

631
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,589
seen the way he clung to him
and begged him to speak-

632
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,751
That poor little boy
worshipped Quint.

633
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:07,763
Worshipped him?
That man? Miles?

634
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,527
You didn't know Quint, miss.

635
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,432
Such power he had over people.

636
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,437
You can't blame the child.

637
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,439
A lonely boy with no father.

638
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,441
Quint took advantage,
that's all.

639
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,671
It made me sick to see
Miles trotting after him like a little dog.

640
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,680
They were always together.

641
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,315
- #</i># Quiet, everyone.

642
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,680
- #</i># Quiet, everyone.

643
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,446
The entertainment
is about to commence.

644
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,044
Oh, look, miss.

645
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,556
I borrowed your pin cushion.

646
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,785
I hope you don't mind.

647
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,396
Miss Giddens, dear,
would you sit there?

648
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:44,797
And, Mrs. Grose,
would you sit there too?

649
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,341
And now Miles will recite to you.

650
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,076
A poem.

651
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,311
What shall I sing to my lord
from my window?

652
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,854
What shall I sing,
for my lord will not stay?

653
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:08,891
What shall I sing,
for my lord will not listen?

654
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,758
Where shall I go,
for my lord is away?

655
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,698
Whom shall I love
when the moon is arisen?

656
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,235
Gone is my lord...

657
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,067
and the grave is his prison.

658
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,234
What shall I say
when my lord comes a-calling?

659
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,440
What shall I say
when he knocks on my door?

660
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:36,178
What shall I say
when his feet enter softly...

661
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:40,347
leaving the marks
ofhis grave on my floor?

662
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,448
Enter, my lord.

663
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,187
Come from your prison.

664
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,196
Come from your grave...

665
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,199
for the moon is arisen.

666
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,701
Welcome, my lord.

667
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,046
Look at that.

668
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,548
- What, miss?
- I was afraid for them.

669
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,552
But what if he knows?
What if Miles knows?

670
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,555
Knows what,
Miss Giddens, dear?

671
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,557
You think I'm imagining it...

672
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,560
and yet just now you yourself saw
and heard Miles-

673
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,062
Playing a game.

674
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,065
You told me
Quint and Miles were always together.

675
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,067
But Master Miles
wasn't to blame for that.

676
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,070
- Yes, but couldn't you have stopped it?
- I wasn't in charge, miss.

677
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,005
It wasn't for me to question
the master's arrangements.

678
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,009
The master
put Quint in charge here.

679
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,569
Besides, no one
could go against Quint.

680
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,583
You were afraid of him?

681
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,087
But what of Miss Jessel?

682
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,089
Couldn't she
have done something?

683
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,591
Or was she afraid of him too?

684
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,594
Not at first.
At least-

685
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:57,190
In the beginning, when she first came here,
she was always happy and smiling.

686
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,201
Very fond of music she was...

687
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,134
and dancing.

688
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:05,072
She and Miss Flora used to dance together,
dance by the hour.

689
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,075
But she changed.

690
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,077
Oh, yes, she changed.

691
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,079
'Twas hard to believe...

692
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:14,082
her being an educated young lady
and Quint being...

693
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,584
- well, what he was.

694
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,587
Stop it, Miles.! Stop it.!

695
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,589
You see? I knew
they'd be overexcited.

696
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,591
It's long past their bedtime.

697
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,594
Yes, but what did you mean
about Quint and Miss Jessel?

698
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,130
Look, miss, they're dead, gone.

699
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,723
There's no point in telling tales
of what's over and done with.

700
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,775
Over and done with?

701
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,780
Yes, but is it?

702
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,044
Let go, Flora. You'll fall in.

703
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,240
But I want to row the boat.

704
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,374
Silly.
You know you can't.

705
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,045
Miss Giddens, tell Miles
to let me row.

706
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,554
I will,
when you're a little older.

707
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,886
But it's too heavy
for you now.

708
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,291
I don't care.
I've got a boat of my own anyway.

709
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,966
Heavenly, warm sun.

710
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,971
It's almost hot.

711
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,974
I like it when it's hot.

712
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:49,477
- Do you know what Miles told me once?
- No, dear. What?

713
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,037
He said that once, when he was on the lake,
he could see a hand waving on the bottom.

714
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,813
But Mrs. Grose said,
"Stuff and nonsense.! Stuff and nonsense.!"

715
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,093
Miss Giddens,
can tortoises swim?

716
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,095
No, dear.

717
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,165
I thought
perhaps they couldn't.

718
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,765
#<i> # 

719
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,176
#<i> # 

720
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,247
Flora, where did you
learn that song?

721
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,709
I don't think I remember.

722
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,286
#<i> # 

723
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:35,082
It's the song
from the music box, isn't it?

724
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,785
Isn't it?

725
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:41,091
#<i> # 

726
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,784
Flora.!

727
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,788
Who is it?

728
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,358
Over there.

729
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:46,457
Oh, goodness, miss, you gave me
quite a turn sitting there in the dark.

730
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,624
- And where are the children?
- Upstairs with Anna.

731
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:54,932
I wanted to be by myself
for a while, to think.

732
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:58,838
Well, miss, I'm sure a little light
will make your thoughts more cheerful.

733
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:03,709
Mrs. Grose?
There are two of them.

734
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,804
I beg your pardon?

735
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:10,216
Two of those abominations.

736
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,549
Today, down by the lake...

737
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,457
there in the broad sunlight...

738
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,621
I saw the other one.

739
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,530
- The other one?
- A woman dressed in black.

740
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,003
- Miss Jessel.
- Oh, but Miss Jessel's dead.

741
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,835
She died, why, almost a year ago.

742
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,241
Huh. Almost a year ago.

743
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:38,109
Almost a year.

744
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,206
Flora saw her too.

745
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,308
- Did she tell you so?
- No, of course not.

746
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,887
She lied to me.
Well, it amounted to a lie.

747
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:49,049
Oh, now, miss, I've never known
either of the children to tell lies.

748
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,218
- Why would they?
- Why?

749
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,161
Because they are both playing...

750
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:58,064
or being made to play
some monstrous game.

751
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,693
I can't pretend to understand
what its purpose is.

752
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:03,136
I only know that it is happening.

753
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,268
Something secretive
and whispery...

754
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,369
and indecent.

755
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,849
I tell you, believe me,
the children are in dreadful peril.

756
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,511
Well, what are we to do?

757
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,521
Then you do believe me?

758
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,353
You don't think I'm imagining it?

759
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:27,260
- I believe you, miss.
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.

760
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,162
I've been so frightened.
I've felt so alone.

761
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,895
But together,
with you to help me-

762
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,471
Oh, yes, miss, I'll help you.
Only tell me how.

763
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,836
Yes.

764
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,901
We must try to learn
what it is these horrors want.

765
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:49,618
Think, Mrs. Grose.
The answer must lie in the past.

766
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:56,625
Were Quint
and Miss Jessel in love?

767
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,925
They were in love, weren't they?

768
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,127
Love? Oh, I suppose
that's what she called it.

769
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,363
But it was more
like a sickness...

770
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:13,841
a fever that leaves the body
burned out and dry.

771
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,537
There was no cruelty
she wouldn't suffer.

772
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,173
If he struck her- Oh, yes,
and I've seen him knock her to the floor-

773
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:24,720
she'd look at him as though
she wanted the weight of his hand.

774
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,654
No pride, no shame.

775
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,157
Crawl to him on her hands and knees,
she would.

776
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,720
And him laughing at her.
Such a savage laugh he had.

777
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,927
Oh, it hurts me to remember.

778
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,994
Bad she was, but no woman
could have suffered more.

779
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:47,736
Aperson ought to
keep quiet about it.

780
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,176
You must tell me.

781
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,774
Oh, miss, there's things
I've seen I- I'm ashamed to say.

782
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,943
Go on.

783
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,320
Rooms...

784
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,052
used by daylight...

785
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,594
as though
they were dark woods.

786
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,464
They didn't care
that you saw them?

787
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,931
And the children?

788
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,171
I can't say, miss.
I-I don't know what the children saw.

789
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,838
But they used to follow
Quint and Miss Jessel...

790
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,576
trailing along behind
hand in hand, whispering.

791
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,244
There was too much whispering
in this house, miss.

792
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,787
Oh,yes, I can imagine.

793
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,517
Yes, I can imagine
what sort of things...

794
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,560
they whispered about.

795
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:43,223
Quint, Miles.
I can hear them together.

796
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,564
But there was nothing wrong
in Master Miles wanting to be with Quint.

797
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,194
Quint taught him to ride
and took him walking.

798
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:52,502
- The poor lad needed someone to-
- To corrupt him?

799
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,941
But Master Miles
is a good boy, miss.

800
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,512
- There's nothing wicked in him.
- Unless he's deceiving us.

801
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,139
Unless they're both deceiving us.

802
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,185
- The innocents.
- Innocents they are, miss.

803
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,686
It's not fair.
You have no right to accuse them of-

804
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,257
Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Grose.
I'm not accusing.

805
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:13,455
I'm just trying to put it together,
to understand.

806
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:16,464
Tell me, were the children happy?

807
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,693
Oh, they seemed to be.
The same as now.

808
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,636
But sometimes I used to wonder if
they really cared for them, those two...

809
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,902
or if they weren't
just using them.

810
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,604
Using them?

811
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,545
Yes, of course they were...

812
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:34,674
and still are.

813
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,553
And in the end, what happened to her,
Miss Jessel?

814
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,453
Oh, that was pitiful.

815
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:45,824
When Quint was found,
she went into blackest mourning.

816
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,557
Her, that should have
hated the man.

817
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:52,066
She grieved till there was something
crazy in her eyes.

818
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,534
Never slept.
Never ate.

819
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:58,232
I used to hear her wandering about
all over the house, sobbing.

820
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,340
Couldn't go on.

821
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,073
Finally she died.

822
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:09,117
Here? At Bly?
But of what did she die?

823
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:13,019
Well, I suppose
you might say a broken heart.

824
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,454
Excuse me, miss.
They're in bed now.

825
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,550
All scrubbed and nice and waiting
for you to hear their prayers.

826
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,561
Thank you, Anna.
I shall be up in a moment.

827
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,860
- One thing more before I go.

828
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,231
- Yes, miss?
- Our local vicar, what sort of man is he?

829
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,170
The Reverend Fennel?
Oh, he's a very fine sort of gentleman, miss.

830
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,173
Oh, but, miss,
I wouldn't do that.

831
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,767
I-I mean, if you were thinking of discussing
with the vicar what we have been discussing...

832
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,904
oh, I wouldn't, miss.

833
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,781
- Why not?
- Well, it might cause talk, a scandal.

834
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,252
Haven't we worse to fear
than a scandal?

835
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:51,260
But what good would it do, miss, telling
the vicar our secrets? He can't help us.

836
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,989
He's perhaps
the only one who can.

837
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:06,803
What good would it do, miss,
telling the vicar our secrets?

838
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,071
He can't help us.

839
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:13,080
Only remember,
you are in supreme authority.

840
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:15,912
Shh. Flora,
it's a secret.

841
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,749
You must remember
it's a secret.

842
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,096
Watch her.

843
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,533
Watch her.

844
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,594
- Flora, it's a secret. It's a secret.

845
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,793
It's a secret.
A secret.

846
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,802
#<i> # 

847
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,998
- I've made up my mind.

848
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,900
Right after church, I shall take the next train
to London and see their uncle.

849
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:44,030
- He must have returned.

850
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,543
Because I-
We can go on no longer without help.

851
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,409
I know you're almost sick with worry,
but accept for odd times...

852

you can't say the children
haven't been good.

merely easy to live with.

We have no part in their real life.

Dear Mrs. Grose, I know it's hard for you
to think wrong of those children...

a pair of calculating liars?

1022
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:31,397
- Flora?
- Oh, there you are.

1023
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:34,304
I thought someone
was watching me.

1024
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:37,071
And who did you think it was?

1025
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,613
Why, Miss Giddens,
you came out without your hat.

1026
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,912
- So did you.

1027
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,181
- How did you get here, dear?
- In the boat.

1028
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,222
Miss? Miss Giddens?

1029
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:51,383
And when did you learn
to row, Flora?

1030
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:56,155
Miles taught me.

1031
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,232
Why did you come here?

1032
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,894
I always come here when I want to dance,
when I want to be alone.

1033
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:06,268
And who gave you that music box?

1034
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:09,571
- I don't think I remember.
- Miss Giddens?

1035
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:12,272
Oh, yes, I do.
It was Mrs. Grose.

1036
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:15,144
- No, it was not.
- Wasn't it, Miss Giddens, dear?

1037
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:20,047
And where, my pet,
is Miss Jessel?

1038
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,783
- Where is she, Flora?

1039
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,259
Miss Giddens?

1040
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:28,329
Where is she?
You know you can see her!

1041
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,991
- Miss?
- Look, Flora, look! There!

1042
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,660
- You know you can see her.
- I can't! I can't!

1043
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,705
Admit it! She's there!
You know you can see her!

1044
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,172
- I can't! I can't!
- But look! She's there!

1045
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,209
- Stop it! I'm frightened!
- Stop it, miss.

1046
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:48,112
- But you can see her. You must!

1047
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:52,380
Hush, hush, dear. She isn't there.
How could she be?

1048
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,751
She's dead and buried.
Hush, little lamb.

1049
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:59,486
I can't see anything! I've never seen anything!
You're cruel! You're wicked!

1050
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:02,222
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

1051
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,127
- Flora!
- Take me away from her.

1052
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:07,827
She's cruel! Take me away!
Please take me away!

1053
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:11,633
Don't look at her! Don't look at her!
She frightens me so!

1054
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,470
- Hush, dear. Come on.

1055
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:18,706
- Mrs. Grose!

1056
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,543
Come along.

1057
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:19,968
I like it when the fire
does that. Don't you?

1058
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:12,918
Shh. Hush, my love. Anna will stay with you.

1059
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:32,208
I've never known the equal.
Never. It's beyond nature.

1060
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,282
Now do you believe me?
Now that you've seen?

1061
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:36,373
Now that I've heard.
In all my years-

1062
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,215
and I've known a vile tongue or two in my time-
never have I heard such obscenities.

1063
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:43,291
- That pleases you?

1064
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:46,588
No, of course not, but it justifies me.
It's proof.

1065
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:50,927
Perhaps it is, but to hear such filth
from a child's mouth...

1066
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,728
I don't know where
she could have learned such language.

1067
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:57,134
- I know.
- I never heard her speak like it before. Never.

1068
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:00,002
- Till you came.
- You saw who taught her.

1069
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:04,568
- You saw that woman.
- I know what I saw.

1070
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,648
Has she mentioned it?
Mentioned Miss Jessel?

1071
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,014
- Only to say there was no one there.
- You pretended to believe her.

1072
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:14,247
I didn't have to pretend.

1073
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:18,217
Well, how can you say that?

1074
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:22,558
As though you-you too
were a complete innocent?

1075
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,565
Well,you lived here.
You knew those two.

1076
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,727
You knew them when they were alive,
and what influence they were on the children.

1077
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:33,103
And it frightened you.
When I came here, you were still frightened.

1078
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,506
Oh, you were.
I sensed it. And why?

1079
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:38,773
Because you felt
they weren't really dead.

1080
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,781
And now, despite all that,
you turn on me.

1081
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:43,783
You blame me.

1082
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:46,479
And all I want to do is save the children,
not destroy them.

1083
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:49,489
- Don't you know that?
- All I know is Miss Flora
was a sweet, innocent child...

1084
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:51,752
a happy child, until
you made her face that-

1085
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:56,593
- That woman! Say it!
- That bad memory!

1086
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,324
It may have been the saving of her.

1087
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:05,304
But you must take her to her uncle.

1088
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,500
You must both go away tomorrow.

1089
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:11,602
Away from me, away from them,
the servants- everyone must go.

1090
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,511
Leave you here all alone?

1091
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:18,814
Except for Miles.

1092
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,787
We were together this afternoon...

1093
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,688
sitting in front of the fire.

1094
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:27,023
He didn't say anything...

1095
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:29,494
but he wanted to.

1096
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:32,065
It was like a pendulum...

1097
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,364
and I could feel it
swinging my way.

1098
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:38,837
Slowly, slowly.

1099
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:43,934
Oh, yes, he wanted to reveal himself
and ask for my help.

1100
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:48,914
And we must give him that chance.
Don't you understand that?

1101
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,315
After today, miss,
I doubt I shall ever understand you.

1102
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,887
It was a cruel thing.
And if you're planning another cruelty-

1103
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:57,446
But to wake a child out of a bad dream,
is that a cruelty?

1104
01:24:57,559 --> 01:25:00,722
If you were my age...

1105
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,525
and had cared for
as many children as I have...

1106
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:07,658
you'd know that waking a child can sometimes
be worse than any bad dream.

1107
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,498
- No.
- It's the shock.

1108
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:13,096
And then being suddenly deprived.

1109
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,472
No, you're wrong.
You're talking nonsense.

1110
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,875
As you say, miss.

1111
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,504
You and Flora
will leave tomorrow.

1112
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:24,016
It is my decision.
I shall send the servants away.

1113
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:28,556
He put me in charge-
in sole charge, Mrs. Grose.

1114
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:32,752
Tomorrow
I must be alone here with Miles.

1115
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,462
Miss, may I ask what I am
to tell their uncle?

1116
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,561
The truth.

1117
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:44,729
The truth?

1118
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:49,371
Yes, miss.
Thank you.

1119
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:09,695
Mrs. Grose,
have you got my letter?

1120
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:12,891
- What letter, miss?
- To their uncle. I left it on the desk.

1121
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,026
Oh, I haven't touched it, miss.

1122
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:17,161
Well, I wonder who-

1123
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,207
Oh, of course- Miles.

1124
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:23,004
- You're accusing him of stealing?
- Well, what matter.

1125
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:27,480
It's just one thing more for us
to talk about when we're alone.

1126
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:31,450
- Where is Master Miles?
- He went out early this morning.

1127
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,783
But I shall wait for him.

1128
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:37,051
He'll come to me.

1129
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:41,993
Well, I-I suppose
Miss Flora and I had best be on our way.

1130
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:45,425
Give her my love...

1131
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,433
when she's better.

1132
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:52,905
And, Mrs. Grose, please,
wait till you see Miles again...

1133
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:54,907
before you judge me.

1134
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,909
I can'tjudge you, miss.

1135
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,809
A body can only judge themselves.

1136
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:05,319
May God be with you, miss.

1137
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:29,128
So, here you are.

1138
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:32,495
I say, are we
having tea in here?

1139
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:36,127
- Yes, Miles.
- How very grand and grown-up.

1140
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:40,731
Yes, and we can
talk together now, like adults.

1141
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:44,573
Jolly nice, I call it.

1142
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:48,308
I feel quite
the master of the house.

1143
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,509
Where are the servants?

1144
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:52,518
They've gone home.

1145
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:57,250
Oh, did you send them,
or did they take fright and run away?

1146
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,258
What do you mean?

1147
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:03,990
Well, you're afraid,
and perhaps you made them so.

1148
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:07,625
And of what-
assuming you are right-

1149
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,828
of what am I afraid, Miles?

1150
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:14,033
I'm not a mind reader, my dear.
I've told you that before.

1151
01:30:14,142 --> 01:30:16,269
But I do sense things.

1152
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:21,071
Don't worry.
There's a man in the house.

1153
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:23,082
Is there?

1154
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:25,914
Yes, me.
I'll protect you.

1155
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:34,489
I say, it is fun.

1156
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:37,393
We've got the whole house
to ourselves.

1157
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:42,128
More or less.
There are still the others.

1158
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,972
Poor Flora.
Is she awfully ill?

1159
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:47,973
I mean, is it serious?

1160
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:50,100
Has she gone to hospital?

1161
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:52,736
No,just to London.

1162
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:56,339
I think Bly
didn't agree with her anymore.

1163
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,215
- This house upset her.
- Suddenly?

1164
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,220
Oh, no, I had seen it
coming on.

1165
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:04,485
Did you?
Then why didn't I?

1166
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:09,689
I love Flora, and I know what she feels
before she feels it herself.

1167
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:13,961
She loved this house.

1168
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:16,161
She was as happy here-

1169
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,500
As happy as I am.

1170
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,506
Are you?

1171
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:23,543
- What?
- So very happy.

1172
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:28,572
Are you, Miles?

1173
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:33,580
If you'll excuse me.

1174
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,957
- Miles, you haven't-

1175
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:54,703
Poor Flora. She must have been upset
to have forgotten Rupert.

1176
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:02,744
Why did you want to
be alone with me?

1177
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,977
I think you know very well.

1178
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:06,986
What do I know?

1179
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:11,422
Or rather, what is it
that you want to know?

1180
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:15,963
Well, for one thing, why that night
when you were supposed to be in bed...

1181
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:18,827
- why were you in the garden?
- I told you.

1182
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:22,562
The real reason, Miles.

1183
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:26,265
It's beyond me why you go on asking
a fellow questions...

1184
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,810
when every time he answers you
you tell him it isn't true.

1185
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,311
Because you are not
telling the truth.

1186
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:35,109
Don't shout.
Don't be so angry.

1187
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,548
It does something to your face.

1188
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:40,621
It makes you look ugly and cruel.

1189
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:44,623
Miles. Miles, listen to me.

1190
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,057
I'm not a cruel person.

1191
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:49,891
I'm sometimes very foolish
and I make mistakes...

1192
01:32:49,997 --> 01:32:52,932
but I'm not cruel.

1193
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:56,663
My father taught me
to love people and help them.

1194
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:59,262
Help them even if
they refuse my help.

1195
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:01,273
Even if it hurt them sometimes.

1196
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:04,435
And that's the only reason
I'm here is to help you.

1197
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:07,207
Whatever you've done,
I'm not against you.

1198
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:10,546
- I don't think it's your fault.
- But I haven't done anything.

1199
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:14,143
Then why were you
sent home from school?

1200
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:19,993
It must be because I'm different.

1201
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:24,793
But you aren't.
You're like any other boy.

1202
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:27,595
Ah, now who isn't
telling the truth?

1203
01:33:27,702 --> 01:33:32,139
If you really thought that,
we wouldn't be having these conversations.

1204
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:35,675
No, my dear, you don't think
I'm like any other boy.

1205
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,676
That's why you're afraid.

1206
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:41,507
If I am, it's for you.

1207
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,084
And I am afraid
for you, Miles.

1208
01:33:44,185 --> 01:33:46,653
- If you don't tell me now-
- There's nothing.

1209
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:49,484
Isn't there?
Why did you take my letter?

1210
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:53,048
You did take it, didn't you?

1211
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,151
Yes, I took it.

1212
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:57,628
Why?

1213
01:33:57,732 --> 01:34:00,394
To see what you said about us.

1214
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:02,799
- Us?

1215
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,565
Well, about me.

1216
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:08,369
- And what did you discover?

1217
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,468
You thanked my uncle
for trusting you.

1218
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,672
You apologized for troubling him...

1219
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:15,908
for asking him to come down.

1220
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:18,144
Go on, Miles.
What else did I say?

1221
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:23,053
That's all I read. I heard footsteps.
I threw it on the fire.

1222
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,751
And did you take other things?

1223
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,090
Is that what you did at school?

1224
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:30,095
No, I'm not a thief.

1225
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,665
Then what did you do, Miles?

1226
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:37,431
I-Well, I- I said things.

1227
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:43,175
Yes, Miles?

1228
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:49,006
Sometimes I hurt things.

1229
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:53,081
And sometimes at night...

1230
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:55,655
when everything was dark-

1231
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:59,126
- What?
- They screamed.

1232
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:01,956
The masters heard about it.

1233
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:08,199
They said I frightened
the other boys.

1234
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:13,038
And when...

1235
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:17,372
did you first see
and hear of such things?

1236
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:21,574
Why, I- I made them up.

1237
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,881
Who taught them to you?

1238
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:30,684
I told you,
they just came into my head.

1239
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:33,021
What were they?

1240
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:35,823
Shall I tell you
who taught them to you?

1241
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,830
I won't ever again.
I promise.

1242
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:40,423
Shall I tell you who taught you
the things you've done, the things you've said?

1243
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:44,561
- Shall I tell you his name?
- You don't fool me.

1244
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,503
- I know why you keep on and on.

1245
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:49,167
It's because you're afraid.
You're afraid you might be mad.

1246
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:52,939
So you keep on and on, trying to make me
admit something that isn't true.

1247
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:55,379
Trying to frighten me
the way you frightened Flora.

1248
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:57,974
- Miles.
- But I'm not Flora. I'm no baby.

1249
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,280
You think you can
run to my uncle with a lot oflies.

1250
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:03,584
But he won't believe you,
not when I tell him what you are-

1251
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:07,024
a damned hussy,
a damned dirty-minded hag!

1252
01:36:07,128 --> 01:36:10,757
You never fooled us. We always knew.

1253
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,654
- Miles?
- Forgive me.

1254
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:46,221
Hush, darling, hush.

1255
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:48,631
- There.
- I didn't mean it.

1256
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:52,297
Oh, it wasn't you.

1257
01:36:52,406 --> 01:36:55,807
That voice, those words...

1258
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,810
they weren't yours.

1259
01:36:57,912 --> 01:37:00,278
Forgive me.

1260
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:02,212
Oh, Miles.

1261
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:05,877
Dear Miles, say it now.

1262
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:07,977
Now, while I'm holding you.

1263
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:10,750
Say his name...

1264
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:12,985
and it will all be over.

1265
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:15,527
Who?

1266
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:18,757
The man who taught you.

1267
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:20,766
The man you've been meeting...

1268
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:22,768
that you've never
stopped meeting.

1269
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,430
You're wrong!
You're insane!

1270
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:30,033
- You're insane! You're insane!
- His name, Miles!

1271
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:33,341
His name, Miles.
Tell me his name!

1272
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,745
- You must tell me his name!
- He's dead!

1273
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:41,110
- Look! Miles, look!

1274
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:43,122
- Look.!
- No!

1275
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:46,523
- He's here! For the last time, he's here!
- No, no, he's dead!

1276
01:37:46,627 --> 01:37:50,028
He's here,
and you must say his name!

1277
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:54,396
Quint! Peter Quint!
Where? Where?

1278
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:57,800
Where? Where, you devil?

1279
01:37:57,905 --> 01:37:59,805
Where?

1280
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:24,494
- He's gone, Miles.

1281
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:26,498
You're safe.

1282
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:30,593
You're free.

1283
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,804
I have you.

1284
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,378
He's lost you forever.

1285
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:44,513
Miles?

1286
01:38:51,959 --> 01:38:53,859
Miles!

1287
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:56,122
Miles.!

1288
01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:01,934
Oh!

1289
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:07,306
Oh, no.
