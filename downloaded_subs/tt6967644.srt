1
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,699
Professor!

2
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,368
<i> Jesus, Sanjay,</i>
<i>it's like 3...</i>

3
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,238
They miscataloged it! They
didn't know what they had.

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,306
<i>Can we just-- Can we
talk in the morning?</i>

5
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,376
The Hermopolis dig,
my requisition went through.

6
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,211
I have<i> The Alchemical Manuscript</i>

7
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,480
of the cult of
Hermes Trismegistus.

8
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,282
<i>- Good Christ!</i>
- It's ours, professor.

9
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,051
They
thought I was asking

10
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,652
for some old grave robber's
journal or something.

11
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,154
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

12
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,322
I can't wait to
see what they say

13
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,259
when Ellen and Osama outshine
the rest of the department.

14
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:02,694
Us against the world, right?

15
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,130
<i>- Always. I'll see you soon.</i>
- Okay.

16
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,131
Professor!

17
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,503
Hello? Professor?

18
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,514
What the fuck? Where did it go?

19
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,715
What?

20
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:57,883
No, no, no, no, no.

21
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,673
What the--

22
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,177
How did that get--

23
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,197
Sanjay? It's Sam.

24
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,404
Sanjay?

25
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,739
Are you here?

26
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,598
Sanjay?

27
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,652
Professor Rand.

28
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,957
Ha. You can't be serious.

29
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,293
No foul play? Are
you blind? Did--

30
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,298
Yes, yes, I'm calm.

31
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,802
Listen, he didn't just
get up and run off

32
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,737
in the 20 minutes
it took me to--

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,872
What about his phone?

34
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,843
Mm-hm.

35
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,911
Mm-hm.

36
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,584
Okay, fine.

37
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,286
Case closed.

38
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,989
God forbid you do any
actual fucking police work.

39
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,298
Yeah?

40
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,615
What the hell are you
doing here, Rand?

41
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,985
Oh, just sampling the
fine academic vintages

42
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,488
of tomorrow's gas
station attendants.

43
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,023
- You care to join?
- You're grading papers here.

44
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,025
You know we had a
faculty meeting?

45
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,728
Oh... damn it?

46
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,665
Since we moved to three a week,
I just get them all mixed up.

47
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,734
What the hell you're talking
about? We just have the two.

48
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,453
Come to think of it,

49
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,171
you have missed every
single Friday meeting.

50
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,672
Get a damn TA.

51
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,007
Jesus, it's been years.

52
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,043
Kid probably got himself
deported or something.

53
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:24,943
Hello?

54
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,458
Hello? Dawn?

55
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,123
Surprise!

56
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,260
- What's with the knife, Sam?
- I just--

57
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,829
You and the cupcake
agreed to a clean fight.

58
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,032
I-- It's just I called you
and you didn't answer.

59
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,868
That's how surprises
work, honey.

60
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,770
Happy anniversary!

61
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:26,905
Aw...

62
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,576
You are so good and I was--

63
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,578
I was at the office
and I didn't remember.

64
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,281
Hush, hush, it's totally fine.

65
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,817
You're just going to have
to make it up to me later.

66
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,152
That is a deal.

67
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,126
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

68
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,179
- Ooh.
- Sign here, please.

69
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,016
Ooh.

70
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,285
You ordered a whole
bunch of lead, right?

71
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,053
This thing is so frickin' heavy.

72
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,188
- Oh!
- Ooh.

73
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,557
Oh, no.

74
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,993
It's addressed to you, babe!

75
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,246
What is this? A
subscription box?

76
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,082
You're doing Indiana
Jones stuff now?

77
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,817
It's from Sanjay.

78
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:46,952
Sanjay?

79
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,855
That-- that's crazy.

80
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,325
He's been gone all these years,

81
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,026
scares the shit out of everyone

82
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,328
and then sends you
a box of junk?

83
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,862
There's no mistaking it.

84
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,666
This... This is the
text that Sanjay found.

85
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,837
It's thousands of years old
and he wrote all over it.

86
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,138
Let's call the police.

87
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,307
And let them confiscate it? No.

88
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,910
They wouldn't even know
what they are looking at.

89
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,078
No, we--

90
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,146
No, I, I need to help Sanjay.

91
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,282
- He would do the same for me.
- I know.

92
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,351
I know...

93
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,053
I have faith in you.

94
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:28,059
But can you fit some anniversary
dinner in your schedule first?

95
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,173
Still at it?

96
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,709
Just getting started.

97
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,062
You have class early.

98
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,797
Mm-hm.

99
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,436
Happy anniversary!

100
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,738
Thank you. You too.

101
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,815
Well, don't stay up too late.

102
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,218
- I love you.
- Love you too.

103
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,157
Well, okay.

104
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,272
Okay, Sanjay, what
does all of this mean?

105
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,457
Help me,
help me, help me! Help me!

106
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,157
Please, tell me you
didn't stay up all night.

107
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,026
No, I slept, I just--

108
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,195
You never quite made
it to bed, huh?

109
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,231
God, and on our anniversary.

110
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,333
God, I'm sorry I'm
such a shitty wife.

111
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,202
It's not a big deal.

112
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,271
I'm late for yoga. Make
sure you eat before class.

113
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,007
Lecturing on low blood sugar is
against the rules, remember?

114
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,943
- Mm-hm.
- Dispense some knowledge.

115
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,344
Yeah, the ghost of Socrates

116
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,613
is going to be so jealous
he could not have courses.

117
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,884
- I love you.
- I love you too.

118
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,968
Something museums.

119
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,145
Grand, grand museums. Sure.

120
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,151
I'm sorry, can I help you?

121
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,521
I wasn't sure if that was
you or not, professor.

122
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,725
We missed you in class, thought
maybe you were sick, but--

123
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,427
Your Anthro 220 class.

124
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,696
We sat there for like
15 minutes, but...

125
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,700
Oh, my God! I was focused on
some other work and I just--

126
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,135
No, it's cool.

127
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,138
We'll just see you
next time, right?

128
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,109
Okay...

129
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,316
Wait, are you the one
that's been posting these?

130
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,717
Yeah.

131
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,219
Was he a student of yours?

132
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,188
Grad student.

133
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,559
Do you mind if I take this?

134
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,495
Sure.

135
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:12,797
Okay.

136
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,644
Hey!

137
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,114
It was you!

138
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,649
You sent me the package.

139
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,751
You left me the trail to follow.

140
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,654
No-- I don't know what
you're talking about.

141
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,089
I'm here to give you this.

142
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,828
My mail box was out
of order, I take it?

143
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,397
The door was unlocked.

144
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:23,234
Aft-- after we talked
in the library,

145
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,336
I asked around and
heard you needed a TA.

146
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,271
And I was hoping that
you might consider--

147
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,573
I don't need one.

148
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,174
The department head said
that you did though--

149
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,776
I don't care what he said.

150
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,211
Are you--

151
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,447
Are you even a grad student?

152
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,381
No.

153
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,617
It's just after I--

154
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,755
After I saw the poster, I
wanted to help you find him.

155
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,730
You can't just find him, okay?

156
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,532
He's been gone for a long time.

157
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,634
I've tried everything.
He's just--

158
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,736
He's just gone.

159
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,273
Then why are you posting those?

160
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,277
Okay, I'm not clear on
why you would care.

161
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,814
I've made posters
like those before.

162
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,351
For my sister.

163
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,720
She disappeared a few years ago.

164
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,524
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that
you went through that.

165
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,826
But it has nothing
to do with Sanjay.

166
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,361
Did you even know him?

167
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:25,763
No.

168
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,700
Look, I'm sorry. I just--

169
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,171
I saw the poster and...

170
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,474
it was like it was
happening all over again

171
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,376
and I don't know, it
might sound irrational,

172
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,345
but I thought that maybe, if I
helped you find him, I could--

173
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,314
Look, you're just a student.

174
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,683
You have enough to worry about.

175
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,854
I'm sorry, professor, but
that is not how this works.

176
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,890
I never get to stop
worrying about my sister,

177
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,660
just like you don't get to
stop looking for your student.

178
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,695
Okay.

179
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,267
God, this must be what it's
like to argue with me.

180
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,405
So, what is your name?

181
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,840
It's Chloe Bishop.

182
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,309
Samantha Rand,

183
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,644
Professor, I guess.

184
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,783
Look, the majority of the search

185
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:23,554
is back at my house if you want
to come help me go through it.

186
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,291
Okay.

187
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,528
And, if you prove to be helpful,

188
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,999
I might consider bringing
you on as my TA, maybe.

189
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,815
Hey, I'm home.

190
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,983
It's about time.
What took you so long?

191
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,687
When you said you left
something at the office,

192
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,689
this wasn't exactly
what I imagined.

193
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:00,992
No, I imagine not.

194
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,394
Chloe, this is my wife,
Dawn. Dawn, Chloe.

195
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,330
Um, Chloe's going to help
me with the project.

196
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,832
She has a personal
interest in it.

197
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,400
Well, it's been a long time

198
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,502
since your last late-night
research party.

199
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,505
- I'll whip up something.
- Thank you.

200
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:22,747
When you were looking for
the person that you lost,

201
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,849
you didn't happen to get
a random box of artifacts

202
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,651
in the mail, just
on the off chance?

203
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,687
No.

204
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,688
You think this is all related
to Sanjay's disappearance?

205
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,808
I do.

206
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,926
Why don't you dig in and
see what you can find out?

207
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,350
I think I found something.

208
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,418
Maybe.

209
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,557
It's just a drawing and it's only
appeared on the internet once.

210
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,328
- How on the earth did you find--
- Reverse image lookup.

211
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,614
Where's it from?

212
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:15,498
It was published in a
psych study in 2015.

213
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,867
This shrink was studying cases

214
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,770
of extreme schizophrenia
and disassociation.

215
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,674
It doesn't say what
the image is of,

216
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,911
but maybe we can call
the doctor tomorrow.

217
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,446
We can do one better than that.

218
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,581
It's only a couple
of hours drive away.

219
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:37,421
But first, I'm probably
going to take you home.

220
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,923
I've kept you too long as it is.

221
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,775
No, don't worry about it.

222
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,626
It's-- I feel like I'm actually
doing something, you know?

223
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,594
It feels good.

224
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,862
Calling it a night?

225
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,897
And you look wiped.

226
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,467
I'll be taking the young
lady home this evening.

227
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:50,401
Thank you.

228
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,703
Thank you.

229
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,594
Okay.

230
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:17,561
Chloe.

231
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,931
I really want to thank
you for helping Sam.

232
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,135
This Sanjay thing has
been really hard on her.

233
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:25,803
It's fine, I um--

234
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,807
I am not really being
entirely selfless either.

235
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,976
Well, I know Sam

236
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,446
and, when she's
set on something,

237
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,948
she's going to keep
going until it's done.

238
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,984
And I'm not in that
world with her,

239
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,420
but you are.

240
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,657
Would you look out for her?

241
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,196
She means the world to me.

242
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,870
Yeah, yeah.

243
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,042
Thank you.

244
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,696
Ah, wife, come join us.

245
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,864
We're about to play around.

246
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,600
What do you say?

247
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,803
Ah, she's too timid
for these stakes,

248
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,540
too frightened to even speak.

249
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,542
I hardly know her, yet I can see

250
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,945
she's not clever enough to
understand what's going on.

251
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,548
There are rules.

252
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,049
She gets a chance.

253
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,050
Sit.

254
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,596
She consents.

255
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,837
She's not equal to the task.

256
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,040
The truth is too large for her.

257
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,709
This is not good, professor.

258
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,178
She is lost.

259
00:26:58,751 --> 00:26:59,917
You okay?

260
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,385
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

261
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,188
It's probably just my
sinuses or something.

262
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,389
Sorry, I woke you.

263
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,825
No, it's okay. Do
you want some water?

264
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,860
No, just go back to sleep.

265
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,797
Actually, I'm going to get up.

266
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,132
I'm going to get an early start.

267
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,333
What do you mean?

268
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,035
Nothing.

269
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,003
Um...

270
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,623
Chloe found something last night

271
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:25,308
and it's few hours up north
and I just want to follow up.

272
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,944
But what about class?

273
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,080
Um...

274
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,883
I'll check in with Thomas.
There's no way he'll say no.

275
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:35,352
Oh, come on!
Thomas is the worst.

276
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,854
Don't lose your job over this.

277
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:39,056
I know.

278
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,059
I'll call him, okay?

279
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,727
I love you.

280
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:44,928
I love you too.

281
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,453
I wasn't expecting
something quite so homey

282
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:12,389
for someone who specializes
in the tough cases.

283
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,324
It's useful for people
to feel comfortable

284
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,193
when chatting with me.

285
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,229
I'm not sure candy works on an
anthropology professor though.

286
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,771
Look, um...

287
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,107
I'm interested in a drawing.

288
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,877
Uh, does this look
familiar to you?

289
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,751
It does.

290
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,120
Do you mind me asking

291
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:45,723
what the significance is
to an anthropologist?

292
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,425
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

293
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,227
Well, I'm not sure
you'll have much luck.

294
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,197
The patient who drew that
isn't very communicative.

295
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,499
Well, maybe I could
speak with them.

296
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,970
That would be against policy
and most certainly pointless.

297
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,141
Look, what could happen?

298
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,976
It's either no harm, no foul

299
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:09,313
or your unresponsive patient
becomes responsive, right?

300
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:13,951
I'm sorry. The policy stands,
immediate family only.

301
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,425
Just out of curiosity,

302
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:25,062
does your patient do other
drawings of symbols?

303
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:28,065
Any chance they drew this one?

304
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,368
Or maybe this one?

305
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,113
Colton,

306
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,449
you have a visitor.

307
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,086
It should be okay
to approach him.

308
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,028
Hey, Colton.

309
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,999
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

310
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,940
Can you tell me
about your drawing?

311
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,075
Yeah?

312
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,559
What about these?

313
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,597
These are his.

314
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,532
His!

315
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,466
You should not have these.
Someone's a thief.

316
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:45,209
Roll the bones, oldest
trick in the book.

317
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,111
You want to know
what happens next?

318
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,885
I bet you didn't win.

319
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,021
Colton!

320
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,159
Ah.

321
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,596
Someone lost the game.

322
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:07,464
Tell me about the dice.

323
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,032
Tell me what the drawings mean.

324
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,434
Shouldn't have them!

325
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,103
Someone's a thief.

326
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,106
Stole from museum!

327
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:19,343
Museum, Grand Museum?

328
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,416
He's watching you,
watching your heart.

329
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,453
He wants to know
if you're scared.

330
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:33,891
I'm scared, you
should be scared.

331
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,126
Oh, God! Oh, you should run.

332
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,127
You should run.

333
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,262
Oh, fuck that!

334
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,264
You should die.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

335
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,366
You should die. Fucking,
kill yourself now

336
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,034
before it's all--

337
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,402
It burns in here!

338
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,272
Burns and scathes
and no room for you!

339
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:53,110
Oh, my God, it burns--
There's no room in here.

340
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,013
But they'll give
you a room in here!

341
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,414
They'll give you a room in here!

342
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,483
Colton! Orderly!

343
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,685
Professor Rand, out now!

344
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,021
But the drawing,
it will lead you

345
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,122
like it led me.

346
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,990
Fear and lead.

347
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,059
Like lead, you know, so heavy!

348
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,928
It's okay. It's okay.

349
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,329
You should die!

350
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:13,630
You should die!

351
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,666
- I wish I did.
- Settle down.

352
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:18,035
- I wish I did!
- Settle down.

353
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,269
Just settle.

354
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,512
Oh, Chloe, come on in.

355
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:29,479
Who's Chloe?

356
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:32,549
Just one of my students. I
guess you got my voice mail.

357
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,835
I did.

358
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:37,120
But an interesting lead is no
excuse for missing meetings.

359
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,957
And I heard you missed a
class out of the blue.

360
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:43,593
Okay, circumstances have
been a little abnormal,

361
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,963
but this isn't just a lead.

362
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:48,098
This is the kind of research
that can make headlines.

363
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,335
Regardless, it's no excuse
for missing meetings.

364
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:52,970
Do your job.

365
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,579
Is now a bad time?

366
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:03,647
Um...

367
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,582
Ignore him.

368
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,553
So, uh...

369
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,589
lead.

370
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,126
It means "to lead".

371
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,161
You went to see
the psychiatrist?

372
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,646
Oh, yeah.

373
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,130
I met the patient
who did the drawing.

374
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:24,001
He was, um... interesting.

375
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:31,708
Well, I could come by later
tonight, if that's okay.

376
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,176
Great.

377
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,411
Okay.

378
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:47,657
Where are you leading me to?

379
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:08,078
CT scans and symptoms

380
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,515
consistent with exposure
to unfiltered reality.

381
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,183
You did this to me, Sam.

382
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,818
How will you protect me, Sam?

383
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,153
I suspect the patient--

384
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,522
I've seen the naked
face of truth.

385
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:21,491
Unable to grasp what
she's just witnessed.

386
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:25,429
She's attempting to process the
experience in a perpetual level.

387
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:29,699
Perpetual level.

388
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,768
A self-imposed hell.

389
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,471
Worried that, incessantly--

390
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,807
a rotting tooth of the mind.

391
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,376
The situation recalls
an expression

392
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:42,245
about omelets and eggs.

393
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,214
We were going
to prove them wrong,

394
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,816
it's us against the world.

395
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:49,586
Not everyone can walk in
the light of truth, Sam.

396
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,855
Some will merely burn.

397
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:57,160
There, see? I'm done.

398
00:34:57,162 --> 00:35:01,231
I need you to learn all
of it, you understand?

399
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:05,469
See, I've lead you
exactly how he led me.

400
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,174
Now, the great work will not be
stopped for our convenience.

401
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,760
There's not a lot of time.

402
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:16,345
We are going to need
you to take notes.

403
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,614
There'll be a test.

404
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,850
Wait, wait, I don't have
anything to write with.

405
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,820
Speaking from experience,

406
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:27,124
I'm quite confident that
you're wrong there.

407
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,327
Take it, you
hesitate, it's gone.

408
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,295
You wake up, all
of this is gone!

409
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,831
Do it. Do it!

410
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,466
Do it!

411
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,202
Come on, professor! Do it!

412
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,437
Do it!

413
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,771
Do it!

414
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,728
So, Thomas was in
her room yelling at her?

415
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,232
He's always had it out for her.

416
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,201
And now he has a better excuse

417
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:46,436
than disapproving of
our lifestyle choice.

418
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,539
Shitty old white guys, best
part of academia, right?

419
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,974
I'll drink to that.

420
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,443
Sam.

421
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,513
Hon, are you okay?

422
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:59,382
- Fine!
- You look a mess.

423
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,918
I'm just-- I'm just
eager to get to it.

424
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,788
No, you're going to go rest.

425
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,425
No, I gotta--
I gotta do this, please.

426
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,235
I thought you'd be
home a few hours ago,

427
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,337
so I've been working
on this for a while.

428
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,772
I don't think it's
an actual language.

429
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,575
There's nothing on the internet
that's like it and I--

430
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,678
- What?
- I can read it.

431
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,914
All of it.

432
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,616
You're kidding.

433
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,720
No, it's an ancient
lost language.

434
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,455
Proto-Sino-Tibetan.

435
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,390
It led to Chinese
and other languages

436
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,025
from that region, but...

437
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,462
it's pictographic.

438
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,563
Here.

439
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,637
God...

440
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,707
Wait, how long did
this take you?

441
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,309
This afternoon.

442
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,037
Uh, here's what I've got.

443
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:31,708
"Winter, sleep, ground, you,
flame, men, naked, summer, sun."

444
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,944
Some more nonsense.

445
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,448
Okay, maybe this language
is just too old.

446
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,451
No, no, that's ridiculous.

447
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:44,087
Winter, sleep, ground,
you, flame, men--

448
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:46,056
Doesn't that sound familiar?

449
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:52,495
Winter, sleep,
winter, sleep, winter, sleep.

450
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,596
Oh, God...

451
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:57,600
This.

452
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,572
Yes!

453
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,342
"In the winter, he
sleeps on the floor

454
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,577
in front of the
fire with the men

455
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,613
and goes about all in
rags, but, in summer..."

456
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,682
Ah, that is it!
It's<i> The Odyssey.</i>

457
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,051
No, that's insane, it's
not even in Greek.

458
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,686
How could you possibly
figure that out?

459
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,521
It's because I teach it.

460
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,558
I mean, hell, you just
took an exam on it, right?

461
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:23,760
My God...

462
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:27,864
Wait, this was--
this was purposeful.

463
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,383
Only a handful of people

464
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,967
could have ever possibly
figured that out.

465
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,937
This was meant for you.

466
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,472
Can I see the book?

467
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,582
Winter he sleeps
on the ground...

468
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,785
This "you" is wrong.

469
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:52,088
Winter sleeps, ground, you--

470
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,493
This "you" is a mistake.

471
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:57,794
No way! Someone goes
through this much effort,

472
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:00,630
they're not going to make
a mistake like that.

473
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,900
Wait a minute, what
else doesn't match?

474
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,436
Okay, this "are".

475
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,606
"You are...

476
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:14,677
asleep and awake."

477
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:22,085
Okay, uh, it's a dream guide.

478
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,422
Grand museums, leads,

479
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:30,527
"You are asleep... and awake."

480
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:31,494
You.

481
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,664
This doesn't make
any fucking sense!

482
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,434
I mean, what the fuck am I
supposed to do with that?

483
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,869
Um, we're just exhausted.

484
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:43,473
This will all make
sense tomorrow.

485
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:45,708
What was that?

486
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,881
I dropped a book.

487
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,553
I'm going to head out.

488
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,022
Good night.

489
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,729
- Did you throw a book at her?
- No, I just--

490
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,164
What was that?

491
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,598
Look, no one gives a
shit about my hand.

492
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,700
- I just--
- Sh.

493
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,836
I give a shit.

494
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,673
What the fuck is going on?

495
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:19,843
You're throwing shit,
your hand's all cut up

496
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,177
and you're lying to me.

497
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:24,547
Sam,

498
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,184
when have we ever
lied to each other?

499
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,026
I'm going to bed.

500
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,842
Are you coming too?

501
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:54,878
No.

502
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,149
I'm going to stay
up for a while.

503
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,255
Get some rest.

504
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:34,911
What's going on?

505
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,179
Come on, open!

506
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,782
Dawn? Dawn?

507
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,251
You are
not permitted passage.

508
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:45,221
You are yet to make
yourself worthy.

509
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:48,257
You lack the
conviction to proceed.

510
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,660
Where's Dawn? Where's my wife?

511
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:53,963
It would be better,
easier to choose death.

512
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:59,402
<i>The price of knowing
is always the same.</i>

513
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,306
<i>Your offering is accepted.</i>

514
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:07,677
She shall sleep among the
in their millions.

515
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,947
<i> You shall</i>
<i>sleep. You shall sleep...</i>

516
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,069
You're okay.

517
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,979
Baby, why wouldn't I be?

518
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,114
No reason.

519
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:20,483
I'm so sorry.

520
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:31,828
Oh, I just cut myself when
I put my necklace on.

521
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,029
It's no big deal.

522
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:38,468
Wait, what's in the bag?

523
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,070
Nothing, just go back to bed.

524
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,473
No, wait, what's going
on? What are you doing?

525
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:45,808
What are you doing with those?

526
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,845
- What are you doing?
- Those aren't good for you!

527
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,948
I don't know, but something
in them is making you sick.

528
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,817
- That's ridiculous.
- Really?

529
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:56,152
You're sleeping like shit,

530
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,521
you could lose your job and
you're hurting yourself.

531
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:01,958
I'm fine. I'm just under
a little bit of stress.

532
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,760
Stress? Come on, Sam!

533
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:06,262
We've been together long enough.
This is something else.

534
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:09,365
- Give me the bag!
- No!

535
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:12,101
You got to know I'm doing
this for your own good.

536
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,907
I can't--

537
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:20,009
I can't believe

538
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,145
that the person I trusted
the most in the world

539
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,113
would steal from me.

540
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,015
When all I'm trying to do,

541
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:29,986
the only thing I am trying
to do is to find Sanjay.

542
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:31,320
Sanjay?

543
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:33,823
You're killing
yourself over Sanjay?

544
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,825
You don't even know
that he's involved!

545
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,865
Sam?

546
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:45,835
Sam, don't go like
this! Do not go.

547
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,537
Sam, look, I'll give
them back to you.

548
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:48,805
I'll give them back to you.

549
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:59,148
Sam, don't leave.

550
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,350
Don't. Come on, we
can figure this out.

551
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,320
Just talk to me.

552
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,423
Talk to me.

553
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:10,359
I'm sorry.

554
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,464
I love you.

555
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,650
Okay, I'm inside.

556
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,655
<i> We need a place</i>
<i>she won't look at every day</i>

557
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,958
<i>and so that no one else
will stumble across it.</i>

558
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:23,960
I got it.

559
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,131
Holy shit!

560
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,500
You know? This would be
a hundred times easier

561
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,319
if we just asked her to help.

562
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,137
<i> Your professor,</i>
<i>you really care for her?</i>

563
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,206
Yeah.

564
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,475
Of course, she's...

565
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,845
She's my best friend.

566
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,612
<i>You'd like for her to be able
to pass another night in peace?</i>

567
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:49,251
<i>Then keep that damn
foolishness out of your mouth.</i>

568
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:52,121
<i>It's likely that you and
I will die doing this.</i>

569
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,590
<i>This is our contingency, Sanjay.</i>

570
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:57,326
<i>A signpost on the path for
your professor should we fail.</i>

571
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,846
I just--

572
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:02,365
<i> To become the map for</i>
<i>mankind's journey to light...</i>

573
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,333
<i>any price is a bargain.</i>

574
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:11,073
Isn't
that right, Samantha?

575
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:16,545
You're already thinking
about it, aren't you?

576
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:22,184
Weighing, whether or not,
you could live with yourself

577
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:25,621
if you sacrificed everyone.

578
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,625
You're such an eager
student, aren't you?

579
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:30,386
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

580
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,722
Thank you so
much for coming.

581
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,524
Absolutely.

582
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,259
I just didn't know what to do.

583
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,862
So, she just left-- in
the middle of the night?

584
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,531
We had a fight

585
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:48,304
and she just wouldn't
let go of those things.

586
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:49,638
I didn't want her
to leave, but--

587
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,340
No, of course not.

588
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,676
Look, I know I hardly know her,

589
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:56,312
but this stuff is getting
to her, I can tell.

590
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:59,181
It's like our life just
got turned inside out

591
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:00,816
all of a sudden.

592
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,685
But I'm going to do
something about it.

593
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:12,395
Okay, she's gone.

594
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:13,229
Class is still for
another 50 minutes,

595
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:15,231
so we should have some time.

596
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:17,800
Wait, shouldn't you be in class

597
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,468
not breaking and
entering with me?

598
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,454
No.

599
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:23,439
Keeping your wife from
retiring to a padded cell

600
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,374
is way more important right now.

601
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,731
Hold on, this is new.

602
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:54,703
Um...

603
00:52:54,705 --> 00:53:00,209
"Only when the young crescent
moon's light alone shines."

604
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:02,711
Does that mean something?

605
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,215
Could be part of the
message we're working on.

606
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,785
Crescent, crescent...

607
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:12,454
I'm getting an awful
feeling about this.

608
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:31,941
Yes. Okay, so there was a
new moon five days ago.

609
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:35,411
So, this young crescent moon
is either tonight or tomorrow.

610
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,387
Whoa, wait, wait!
What are you doing?

611
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,956
What? You take that and
she's going to know

612
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,791
that you came in here
and stole this stuff.

613
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:51,594
So? This is my wife
we're talking about.

614
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:53,862
There's no way Sam's not
going to resent you for that.

615
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:56,565
And right now she's probably
just blowing off steam.

616
00:53:57,602 --> 00:54:00,002
So what? We just wait?

617
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,904
And we just let her go
down this rabbit hole?

618
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:06,575
Dawn, we know exactly
what she knows.

619
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,611
So we're going to keep
a close eye on her

620
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,012
and, when nothing
happens tonight

621
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:12,414
and nothing happens tomorrow,

622
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,650
she's going to realize
this was all in her head.

623
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:18,520
Okay.

624
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:21,957
All right.

625
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:43,812
"Only when the young crescent
moon's light alone shines,

626
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,516
the dream guide leads.

627
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,854
You are asleep and awake,

628
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,057
grand museums?"

629
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,559
Where the fuck is it? Ah!

630
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,998
"You are asleep and awake."

631
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:06,769
Oh.

632
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:11,740
"You are asleep and awake."

633
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,544
"You are asleep and awake."

634
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:29,758
"You are asleep and awake."

635
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:35,651
You.

636
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,858
You are foolish too.

637
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,160
Found your way here

638
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:47,596
to this hypnagogic state

639
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,532
or is it hypnopompic?

640
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,137
It's both.

641
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:58,073
Place liminal to sleep
and wakefulness.

642
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:00,609
I'm trying to help you.

643
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,044
Tell me how to find you.

644
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:06,548
Your journey won't
be a pleasant one,

645
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,619
especially with that
failing liver of yours.

646
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,825
So desperate, you
poisoned yourself.

647
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,827
Even I didn't go that far.

648
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,764
I suppose one could argue.

649
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,605
It means you're ready.

650
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,640
I gave you everything you
needed, Sam, to bring you here.

651
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:37,513
Within the voice of wisdom.

652
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,708
<i> I gave you</i>
<i>everything you needed, Sam.</i>

653
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:20,188
<i>Within the voice of wisdom.</i>

654
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:16,979
Oh, dear God!

655
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:23,018
I'm calling help.

656
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:27,856
Please, come.

657
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:48,010
Sam!

658
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,712
Sam!

659
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,716
You okay? How are you feeling?

660
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,351
Oh, you're awake.

661
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:57,985
Hold on, hold on. I'll
get the doctor, okay?

662
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,122
Wait, wait.

663
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:02,691
What happened?

664
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:11,266
Thomas found you in
your office last night.

665
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,138
You were sick.

666
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,105
Um...

667
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,243
They said you overdosed.

668
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:26,181
That you did some
damage to your liver.

669
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,316
And you could have
gone in a coma...

670
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,252
or died.

671
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,963
I love you so much.

672
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:46,935
Why would you do that?

673
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,239
I'm here for you.

674
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:53,709
You could have talked to me.

675
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:58,747
Just go get the doctor, please.

676
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,286
- Sam...
- Dawn, go get the doctor!

677
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,125
Just go.

678
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,340
Hey, Chloe, I was just
about to text you.

679
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:00,342
<i>- I think I found something.</i>
- She left.

680
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:03,411
She left? What happened?

681
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,330
I tried to stop her,

682
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:07,248
but then she shoved me up against
the wall and she was screaming and...

683
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,384
Okay, is she still
in the hospital?

684
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:10,919
I don't know. Maybe.

685
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,187
- I'm sorry, Chloe.
<i>- No.</i>

686
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:13,221
I should have stopped her.

687
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:16,258
<i>Dawn, she was out of control.</i>

688
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,227
Look, why don't you
come back here?

689
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,195
No, no. If she's in the
hospital, they'll find her.

690
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:23,899
If not, I might know
where she's going.

691
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:26,968
I think I've finally found what
she's been obsessing over.

692
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:44,586
- Hey, thanks for the tip!
- Yeah, you bet.

693
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:25,627
Hello? Anyone here?

694
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:49,317
Holy shit!

695
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:52,287
Sam...

696
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:04,199
I need full compliance,

697
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:07,102
otherwise, I get to change
the date on the placard.

698
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:09,571
Why are you here?

699
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,374
Did the little lamb get lost?

700
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:14,476
No, no. I was led here.

701
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:15,878
Explain!

702
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:17,279
In my dreams, my
student, Sanjay...

703
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:19,447
Mr. Ramdas, mm.

704
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,082
I'm sorry, no exceptions.

705
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,551
The museum is for
ticket holders only.

706
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:26,688
I choose what happens
to intruders.

707
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,957
I have-- in my pocket
I have my ticket.

708
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:31,660
I'm not sure that I care.

709
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:34,963
<i>Security, we talked about this.</i>

710
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:38,033
<i>Check our guest for a ticket
before you have your laughs.</i>

711
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,501
You're no fun.

712
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:43,405
<i>It's not my job to be fun, pet.</i>

713
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:47,309
<i>Shouldn't be my job to
babysit you either.</i>

714
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:48,677
I have my ticket.

715
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,681
Wait! Where's Sanjay?

716
01:05:52,683 --> 01:05:55,116
My job is to keep
out undesirables.

717
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,484
I don't have to help you.

718
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:00,055
Good luck finding your way.

719
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:03,024
Be careful of the
hungrier exhibits.

720
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,589
Hey!

721
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,174
Oh!

722
01:08:49,175 --> 01:08:50,758
Oh,
what the hell are you doing with that?

723
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,728
That's a bloody priceless
relic you're tossing.

724
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:57,198
Were you planning on clubbing
me the thing, were you?

725
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,867
Ugh, rude!

726
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:03,204
A saint used that cross
in the 13th century,

727
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:04,472
Edmund of Canterbury.

728
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:09,177
Here's the fibular taken
from his left leg

729
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:12,147
and it healed people
that touched it.

730
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,815
Well, actually the healing
part is a little bullocks,

731
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,850
but they did make his
leg burn the relic.

732
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:20,755
And that's not in my collection
yet, if I'm being honest.

733
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:24,626
What do you have that
stupid look on your face for?

734
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,329
Who are you?

735
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:31,799
My darling, I'm a docent.

736
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:36,371
You are in a museum. Are
you that easily confused?

737
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:38,873
What kind of museum exactly?

738
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,859
<i>The</i> museum--

739
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,844
Well, not the museum
of this or that,

740
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:46,614
but rather "The Museum".

741
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:49,484
Why would Sanjay bring me here?

742
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:51,386
Why does anyone come here?

743
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:57,258
They were led here either
by donating something or...

744
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:00,695
just going mad.

745
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:01,629
Oh, mad?

746
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:03,565
Yes, dear.

747
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:06,801
Ooh, you've been quite a
long ways now, haven't you?

748
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:07,936
Rough trip here?

749
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,440
I'm looking for my student.

750
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:13,675
His name is Sanjay.

751
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:14,976
Hmm, yes, I know him.

752
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:16,544
If you just follow me.

753
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,460
Uh--

754
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:34,362
I, uh--

755
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:35,964
I don't go in there.

756
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,498
Uh, well...

757
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,001
Thank you for your
patronage, dear,

758
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:42,537
and do take care to keep
off the carpeted areas

759
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:44,606
in case you decide to, uh--

760
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:47,976
Well...

761
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,498
Dear, dear, dear.

762
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:25,747
Magnificent, isn't it?

763
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:30,785
Sanjay!

764
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:35,790
I've been looking for you and
you've been here the whole time?

765
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,308
I know.

766
01:11:37,309 --> 01:11:38,825
That's what gave me hope
you'd actually make it here.

767
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:42,430
What is here?

768
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,464
My marriage is on the rocks,
I probably lost my job.

769
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,369
Please, tell me...
that this is worth it.

770
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:50,071
Most certainly, professor.

771
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:53,308
This is the noblest of causes.

772
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,711
For people like us,
this is the Holy Grail.

773
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:01,716
Uh, well, bad analogy.

774
01:12:01,718 --> 01:12:04,485
That old trinket is lying on
a shelf in here somewhere.

775
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,755
I've spent the last decade

776
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:10,525
unlocking the secrets
of this place,

777
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:14,629
but, with your help, we'll
finally finish what I started.

778
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:15,863
Not a decade.

779
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,900
It's only been three years.

780
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,806
Hmm, I always wondered
what would happen to time.

781
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:34,015
Feel that?

782
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:38,920
That's the power of real
change, real alchemy.

783
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:42,357
Alchemy, really?

784
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,792
All those references
to affirmative action

785
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:45,960
will seem so quaint

786
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:49,964
after we quite literally
change the world.

787
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:54,802
I think we're beyond
departmental bullshit, don't you?

788
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:59,440
When you said it was us against
the world, you weren't wrong.

789
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:03,611
We stuck together and
now we have this.

790
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:04,979
Oh...

791
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:07,548
<i>The Alchemical</i>
<i>Manuscript</i> -- you--

792
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,816
Oh, my!

793
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:10,485
You translated it.

794
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:13,554
Funny story about that--

795
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,091
When I said it was
a stroke of luck

796
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:20,495
that whoever dug it up
didn't know what they had...

797
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,666
It was a trap.

798
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:27,635
Someone on the same
road as you and I

799
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:31,439
just waiting to see
who'd take the bait.

800
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:33,641
Someone--

801
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:36,744
Colton!

802
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,714
You know the bastard?

803
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:41,616
He's not rotting in hell?

804
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:43,751
Close enough though.

805
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,653
He's in an asylum.

806
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:46,988
He's not doing very well.

807
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:52,693
He's lucky.

808
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:59,667
I've translated every word
in here a hundred times.

809
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:02,670
I'm ready to take
the final step,

810
01:14:03,807 --> 01:14:06,607
but you-- you were
always stronger at this.

811
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:08,509
That's why I brought
you here, professor.

812
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,844
I'm guessing at some
of the meanings,

813
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,879
but we only get one chance.

814
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:13,581
At what? What's the point?

815
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,949
Read it.

816
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:19,120
If you can perfect my
translations, then you'll see.

817
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,955
And so will everybody else.

818
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,893
We have a situation, Mr. Ramdas.

819
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,069
Hmm.

820
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:40,241
I'll let you get to work.

821
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:44,846
We're so close, my old friend.

822
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,970
My God! Dawn!

823
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:11,939
I never thought
I'd see you again.

824
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:15,743
Sanjay, untie me before that
woman comes back again.

825
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,514
What is happening?

826
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,620
Don't worry about her.

827
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:28,556
- But--
- Dawn, you are safe.

828
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:31,192
I promise you. And so is Sam.

829
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,660
She's working on
something right now.

830
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:34,228
It's very important.

831
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,830
Take me to her. I
need to talk to her.

832
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:36,998
She's really busy, Dawn.

833
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,699
I don't think it's
the right time.

834
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:42,136
She hurt someone
in the hospital.

835
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:44,705
I need to speak to her.

836
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:45,740
Dawn,

837
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:51,245
I really think you should
come back at another time.

838
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,252
Take me to her.

839
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:04,992
Yeah.

840
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:07,795
Of course.

841
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:10,865
Right this way.

842
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:29,183
I see why you never told me
what you were doing here.

843
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:31,152
Would you have done all this
if you would have known?

844
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:35,056
I don't think we were
meant to do this, Sanjay.

845
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:37,858
It was locked in there
for a reason, right?

846
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,126
This entity thought--

847
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:43,297
You speak of our God, professor.

848
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:45,800
This is literally
infinite knowledge.

849
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:48,603
All the world's problems could
be solved in an instant.

850
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:51,939
All we have to do is let that
knowledge into our world,

851
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:56,844
to allow humanity to evolve in
the footsteps of the scribe.

852
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:59,013
But we don't know what it means.

853
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:01,382
We don't have any idea
what the costs might be.

854
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:03,784
Professor, we could
achieve world peace,

855
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:05,786
an end to disease,

856
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:09,090
anything we can imagine

857
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:10,825
and much more that we can't.

858
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:16,864
This is the patron of
science and wisdom.

859
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:20,668
It's a God, Sanjay, your words.

860
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,672
We don't know what this entails.

861
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:26,641
What happened to
careful scholarship?

862
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:31,278
Science harnessed the
power of the atom,

863
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:38,653
but science brought us to
the brink of nuclear war.

864
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:40,354
- How is that any different?
- Did you read this?

865
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,157
All of it?

866
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,227
Did anything in there scare you?

867
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:52,767
This is our chance to advance
human society into a golden egg.

868
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,408
You--

869
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:03,778
You finished the translation.

870
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:08,916
It was the only way to
know what it meant.

871
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,184
I had to finish it.

872
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,186
My God, professor.

873
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,155
You've given the
world a great gift.

874
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:16,290
Sanjay,

875
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:18,759
you're hurt.

876
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:19,960
It's nothing.

877
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:22,830
Just a little blood.

878
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:24,398
That's a lot of blood.

879
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,833
No time.

880
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:28,936
Let's begin.

881
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:31,739
What are you not telling me?

882
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,243
That woman that came in...

883
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,378
What happened?

884
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:42,483
What did you do?

885
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,496
What happened to you?

886
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,317
Ah, professor!

887
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:19,186
You should return
to the theatre.

888
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:20,154
What happened?

889
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:24,492
What was the situation that
you mentioned to Sanjay?

890
01:19:24,494 --> 01:19:26,927
Return to the theatre, now!

891
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,529
Answer my fucking question!

892
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,533
Very well then, right this way.

893
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:27,488
Oh, you're not supposed
to be in here.

894
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,957
Get back! Get the fuck back!

895
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:33,093
Get back! Stay away!

896
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:34,461
Oh, my God!

897
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,297
Oh, my God! No... You!

898
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:40,201
What did you do?
What did you do?

899
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:41,435
Oh, my God!

900
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:43,304
Oh, my God!

901
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:46,240
No, no...

902
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:51,212
Why?

903
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:54,415
Oh, God!

904
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:57,218
No!

905
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,854
No... No...

906
01:21:01,324 --> 01:21:04,058
Wake up. Please, wake up.

907
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,161
I love you.

908
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:10,097
Wake up, just wake up.

909
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:11,565
Please, baby, wake up.

910
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:13,467
No!

911
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:21,008
I'm sorry.

912
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:23,010
I'm so sorry.

913
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:28,115
You!

914
01:21:30,586 --> 01:21:32,987
You! You!

915
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:34,655
Did you do this?

916
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:36,156
No, no, no, no.

917
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:38,592
Who did this? Tell me now.

918
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:41,629
Your student was in here
and he came out of...

919
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:43,030
If you--

920
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:45,900
If you touch her body,

921
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:47,902
if you start

922
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,903
whatever the fucking hell
ritual you were doing,

923
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:51,906
if you start it again,

924
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,140
I'm going to come up here

925
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,577
and I am going to
do worse to you

926
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,380
than I did to the
guard downstairs.

927
01:21:59,382 --> 01:22:00,948
Do you understand?

928
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,917
What did you do to the guard?

929
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:03,918
What did you do to her?

930
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:07,554
Go look.

931
01:22:10,326 --> 01:22:11,258
Go look.

932
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:28,242
I love you.

933
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:37,618
Oh, God!

934
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,536
Oh, Dawn...

935
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,073
I'm sorry.

936
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,042
I'm sorry.

937
01:23:24,266 --> 01:23:25,699
You killed her!

938
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,001
How could you?

939
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:29,203
How could you do that to her?

940
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:30,270
To me?

941
01:23:30,272 --> 01:23:34,008
Dawn, she cared for you.

942
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:39,513
She cared for you and
you killed her for what?

943
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:48,422
My
students, come and drink

944
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:52,059
the sweetest nectar
which is true knowledge.

945
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:55,362
Yes, we humbly offer
ourselves to you,

946
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:56,663
who knows the two lands.

947
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:58,532
The machinery of this reality

948
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,735
lies rusted and
choked with dust.

949
01:24:01,737 --> 01:24:04,772
We shall reawaken
it to its purpose.

950
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:06,440
Sanjay, you can't
let this happen.

951
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:07,541
You have to stop it.

952
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,276
Do you know nothing?

953
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:11,445
We are before the--

954
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:15,049
Let the become my,

955
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:16,583
oh, self-begotten.

956
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:19,787
Into this
land of shadows and smoke,

957
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:24,324
we shall pour the
cold light of truth.

958
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:28,362
No!

959
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:30,497
No.

960
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,737
No! No!

961
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:39,406
Sanjay...

962
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:45,779
Sanjay, this isn't you!

963
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:49,817
No, why would you do it?

964
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:53,287
No, what happened to you?

965
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:55,789
What happened to the
guy who talked Dawn

966
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:58,158
into making donuts at 3 a.m.

967
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,428
while we were translating
some stupid pointless books?

968
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,630
Remember, remember when those--

969
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:06,834
when those stupid racist
fucks jumped you?

970
01:25:06,836 --> 01:25:09,470
And I maced them? I maced them.

971
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:12,606
And when they came up and said

972
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:16,110
that they were really
going to fuck me straight

973
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:19,780
and you stopped them?

974
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,882
And then you walked me home

975
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:25,619
and you stayed with
me until I was okay?

976
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:29,289
Please, remember...

977
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:35,496
"Us against the world," right?

978
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,373
Sam!

979
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:50,911
Sam!

980
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:54,748
I'm sorry!

981
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:56,783
I--

982
01:25:58,254 --> 01:25:59,219
I--

983
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:02,289
I killed them.

984
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:09,429
So many people died.

985
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,900
It's inside me.

986
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,239
I can't.

987
01:26:21,477 --> 01:26:25,546
No! No!

988
01:26:25,548 --> 01:26:28,649
No! Oh, God!

989
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:31,952
I'm sorry.

990
01:26:32,821 --> 01:26:36,323
No! No!

991
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:38,926
No! No!

992
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:40,194
It's okay.

993
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,536
I'm sorry.

994
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:55,209
I love you, old friend.

995
01:27:15,998 --> 01:27:18,532
Thank you, Sam.

996
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:22,803
You...

997
01:27:25,007 --> 01:27:26,306
are always...

998
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:29,977
Smarter.

999
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:47,888
Ah, Miss Bishop!

1000
01:28:48,757 --> 01:28:50,490
Please, come in.

1001
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,926
I'll just grab my keys.

1002
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:55,361
Actually, um, I'm here
to see Samantha Rand.

1003
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:56,663
Professor Rand?

1004
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:02,035
Ah, yes, well, she's not
in the best of conditions.

1005
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:03,403
I, uh--

1006
01:29:08,977 --> 01:29:10,711
Of course.

1007
01:29:10,713 --> 01:29:12,112
If you'll just follow me.

1008
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:17,818
Oh, my God...

1009
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:21,888
Professor?

1010
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:24,591
It takes everything

1011
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:26,393
for a bit of knowledge.

1012
01:29:27,463 --> 01:29:30,697
It takes everything, everything

1013
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:32,933
for a bit of knowledge.
Everything.

1014
01:29:32,935 --> 01:29:34,534
That's
about all she says.

1015
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:37,471
Compulsive repetition.

1016
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:44,711
It takes everything for
a bit of knowledge.

1017
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:47,881
Everything, everything.

1018
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,916
Professor, can you hear me?

1019
01:29:49,918 --> 01:29:52,085
Is there anything that
I can do for you?

1020
01:29:58,594 --> 01:29:59,693
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:30:20,783 --> 01:30:24,785
It takes everything, everything.

1022
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:28,054
Takes, takes, takes, everything.

1023
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:33,827
Takes everything for
a bit of knowledge.

1024
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:37,998

He's been more
animated, more lucid.

1048
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:16,222
It's too early to hope for
a breakthrough, but...

1049
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:18,758
I stopped hoping for
that a long time ago.

1050
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:24,864
You're a real bastard,
you know that?

1051
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:27,968
Chloe, you were raised better
than to speak that way.

1052
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,804
Her wife is dead and she's now
in a padded cell down the hall.

1053
01:33:30,806 --> 01:33:32,706
Does that even matter to you?
Does that even register?

1054
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:34,207
Yes.

1055
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:35,709
Look, I feel...

1056
01:33:36,678 --> 01:33:40,180
deep gratitude for both
of them and for you.

1057
01:33:40,182 --> 01:33:42,749
I cannot be more proud of you.

1058
01:33:43,652 --> 01:33:47,087
Chloe, you've done
a good thing here.

1059
01:33:47,089 --> 01:33:49,022
Do you understand me?

1060
01:33:49,024 --> 01:33:51,291
We've laid one more stone on
the path to enlightenment.

1061
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:55,028
To expect anything
else would be hubris.

1062
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,996
Chloe...

1063
01:33:58,233 --> 01:33:59,232
Look at me.

1064
01:34:02,037 --> 01:34:04,337
Don't mourn too long.

1065
01:34:04,339 --> 01:34:08,008
This falls on you, to send the
next seeker on their path.
