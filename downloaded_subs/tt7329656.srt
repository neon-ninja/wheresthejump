00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:53,471
Oh, really? Okay, okay.

3
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,016
Yeah, why not?

4
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,282
Hey, isn't that Mia?

5
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:00,293
I'm so sorry, I-I must have slipped.

6
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,609
Did you have a nice swim there?

7
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:04,528
Don't touch me.

8
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:06,596
Oh, my God!

9
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,455
It was an accident, I swear.

10
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:16,356
Dude, your sister is so lame.

11
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,453
She's not my sister.

12
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:20,092
Come on.

13
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:21,129
Let's go.

14
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:27,585
Oh, my God!

15
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:29,902
Such a loser!

16
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,881
Why is she all wet? I swear!

17
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,475
I'm sorry about that.

18
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,674
But we are going to
see you tomorrow, right?

19
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,549
Yeah. Tomorrow.

20
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,856
Okay. Bye.

21
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:59,018
It's going to be amazing! I promise!

22
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,876
Amazing! Bring your bikini!

23
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,652
Do you want to tell me what happened?

24
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,053
You should just drive.

25
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:45,908
Hey, Mrs. Riley.

26
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:46,977
Hey!

27
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,865
Whoa, did you go for
a swim in your clothes?

28
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:51,911
Shut up, Ben!

29
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:52,731
Hey, Mimi!

30
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,655
Don't call me that!

31
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:54,893
Why are you all wet?

32
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,227
Why is she all wet?

33
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:00,802
I have to talk to her, babe.

34
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:06,800
What happened? Hey! What happened?

35
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,127
Somebody pushed her in the pool at school.

36
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:10,315
No big deal.

37
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:13,602
It's not my fault that nobody likes her.

38
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,667
You know, that's a real nasty thing to say.

39
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:20,200
Sorry.

40
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,337
Sasha!

41
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,668
Look, I know it's tough moving here,

42
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,947
but you two got to look
out for each other, okay?

43
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:29,666
Okay.

44
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:30,868
Thanks.

45
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,908
You guys about done?

46
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,532
Yeah, you are all loaded up, boss.

47
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:37,134
Alright. Thanks, Ben.

48
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,209
See you tomorrow?

49
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,831
See you tomorrow, Carl. Get some rest.

50
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:40,572
Yeah. I will do.

51
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,839
Alright, thanks.

52
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,924
Hey. Mind if I come in?

53
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,260
What's going on?

54
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:12,752
I hate it here.

55
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,978
Mia, you're so much stronger
than you think you are.

56
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:23,188
And if your Mom were here,
she'd be really proud of you.

57
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:25,664
Well, she's not here, is she?

58
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,133
Well, I'm proud to call you my daughter.

59
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:38,106
Look, I know you and Sasha have a
hard time sometimes, but we're family.

60
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:44,188
She's not my sister.

61
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:55,468
It's very good.

62
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:56,546
It's great.

63
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,535
Hey, I almost forgot to show you
guys what I found this morning.

64
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:05,461
Look at this.

65
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:09,193
That's a shark tooth.

66
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,230
Yeah.

67
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,845
Is it a great white?

68
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,240
I think so.

69
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:15,368
Where did you find it?

70
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:18,490
We uncovered a passageway that
leads to a new part of the city.

71
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,289
Nice.

72
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:22,775
But how did the shark get in there?

73
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,871
I don't know.

74
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:27,409
Maybe he swam in from
the sea, chasing a seal,

75
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:30,338
Got lost in the tunnels
hundreds of years ago.

76
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:35,280
That's so cool!

77
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:36,670
You can keep it.

78
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,865
That kind of brings me
around to something else.

79
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:41,370
Girls, I know I said I was going
to hang with you this weekend,

80
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,758
But opening this new passageway,

81
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,051
It means that there's this
team of archaeologists.

82
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,892
- They fly in from Europe next week.
- It's fine, Dad.

83
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,590
So I got to finish mapping
the caves, laying the lights...

84
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:51,874
You don't have to explain.

85
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,782
But your father planned something
very special for the two of you.

86
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,114
What?

87
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,289
Well, the shark tooth is a clue.

88
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,754
Girls, come on. Here, show them.

89
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,236
There you go.

90
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,539
A glass bottomed boat ride

91
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:16,285
To see great white sharks
in their natural habitat?

92
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:17,601
Sounds fun to me.

93
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,894
No. This is for tourists.

94
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:20,528
Well, we're kind of tourists.

95
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:21,897
Girls, it's going to be awesome.

96
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:25,011
They take you out to where
the great whites feed.

97
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,654
You get to watch them through this
viewing gallery in the bottom of the ship.

98
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,346
It's awesome.

99
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,323
No. I have plans for tomorrow.

100
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,745
Well, you'll just have
to rearrange your plans.

101
00:09:33,842 --> 00:09:36,039
And besides, I think this is a
wonderful way for the two of you

102
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,110
- To spend quality time together.
- Yeah.

103
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,107
Where are you going?

104
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:47,077
To let Alexa and Nicole know
that I can't hang out tomorrow.

105
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,854
Is that okay?

106
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,135
Watch your tone.

107
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:56,498
Well, I am sorry about tomorrow, but
the sharks are going to be really cool.

108
00:09:56,903 --> 00:09:59,750
And maybe next week you
and I can go scuba diving.

109
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:01,783
Remember how much you used
to like diving with me?

110
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,791
Yeah, I was, like, ten years old, Dad.

111
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:06,699
Ten years old. The youngest
person I'd ever seen scuba dive.

112
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,011
Come on. Are you kidding me?

113
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:09,454
And the cutest.

114
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,752
Yeah, you were like a little sea monkey.

115
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:29,374
Alright, guys. Who's ready
to see some sharks today?

116
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,951
I'll pick you up on the way home. Okay?

117
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:38,718
Alright.

118
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:43,885
Hey, Mimi, don't get eaten by a shark!

119
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,471
Stop!

120
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:46,939
Yeah, Mimi, don't get eaten by a shark!

121
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,771
Hey, if you start to drown,
we'll come and save you.

122
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,822
I'll save you!

123
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,171
Look!

124
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:06,690
I can't believe she's here.

125
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,858
Oh, my gosh!

126
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,666
What the hell are you guys doing here?

127
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:18,017
Come on. We had plans.

128
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:19,135
I told you, I can't.

129
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,326
Dude, I am going to
take you to a place that

130
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:24,210
no tourists would ever
find in a million years.

131
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,242
Chance of a lifetime.

132
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,488
Or would you rather stay
on this stupid boat instead?

133
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:29,548
Yeah.

134
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,917
I mean stay. Stay if you want to.

135
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,712
Hey, maybe you can become
friends with Catherine.

136
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,265
Talk about how beautiful she is!

137
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:39,459
She is beautiful though.

138
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:40,951
Dude, shut up!

139
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,046
It's up to you.

140
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:45,009
- Come on!
- One second.

141
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:51,140
You really want to spend all
day on a boat with those girls?

142
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,768
Come on.

143
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:56,325
She's so scared.

144
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,542
What do you think?

145
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:01,466
I don't know.

146
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:03,367
Don't let those girls get to you.

147
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:05,636
Catherine.

148
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:09,514
Come on.

149
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:13,709
Goodbye, Catherine.

150
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,091
Let's go. Come on.

151
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,028
Okay, watch your step.

152
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:27,249
Guys, come on! We're almost there.

153
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,537
You keep saying that.

154
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,901
This time I mean it.

155
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:41,599
Oh, my God!

156
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:45,829
Whoa!

157
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,821
I mean, how did you even
find out about this place?

158
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,025
Ben took me here.

159
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:54,497
Ben? Like my stepdad's assistant Ben?

160
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,721
Oh, she... stop with that. Oh, my God!

161
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:59,998
Okay, so how do we get down there?

162
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,657
So there's a path that'll
take us around and down.

163
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:07,755
Or you could go that way.

164
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:11,926
What are you waiting for?

165
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,367
It's amazing!

166
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,718
I don't know, I...

167
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:20,800
We should take the path.

168
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:25,380
That was amazing!

169
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,909
Screw the path.

170
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:49,835
That's so cool.

171
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,376
Look at all this stuff.

172
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,032
Whoa.

173
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,491
That's a lot of scuba gear.

174
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:03,050
This is all the equipment that your
stepdad and Ben have been storing

175
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:05,585
for the archaeologist team
that's coming next week.

176
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:08,376
Is this the entrance to the City?

177
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:10,723
Guys, if my Dad finds
us, he's going to kill us.

178
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,744
Chill. I talked to Ben.

179
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,763
Your Dad is on the other side,
mapping out the new tunnel they found.

180
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,705
They will never know we were here.

181
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:20,209
Doesn't look like much of a city to me.

182
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:21,253
It's Mayan.

183
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,802
It was built underground,
out of their burial sites,

184
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,951
to hide from the Conquistadors
when they invaded.

185
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:32,020
Rising sea levels put
most of it underwater.

186
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,919
Thank you, Professor.

187
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:36,626
Did Ben ever take you diving into the city?

188
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,951
Yeah, once.

189
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:39,954
What's it like?

190
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:42,358
It's pretty insane down there.

191
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,468
I mean, we only went as
far as the first cave.

192
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,908
It was built as an entrance to

193
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:52,213
- ...is it Xibalba? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Xibalba! Yeah!

194
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:54,719
- Place of fear.
- Yeah.

195
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,209
Like I was saying, the Mayan underworld.

196
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,307
Burial caves.

197
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:03,250
Yeah, it's pretty scary,
but it's really cool.

198
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:07,001
They have all these old
statues, and altars, and stuff.

199
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:10,325
So what are we waiting for?

200
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,455
Come on. Just the first cave.

201
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:16,490
- But my Dad...
- Is miles away!

202
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,223
Yeah, they have a different way in.

203
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,510
Here, look. Everything we need.

204
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:24,439
I mean, there's no fins, so...

205
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,648
Come on! It's the first cave.
We're not swimming the whole city.

206
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,064
Guys, cave diving is dangerous.

207
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,261
Cave diving is dangerous!

208
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:32,982
No. Mia is right, Nicole.

209
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,733
I don't really know about this.

210
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:38,536
Look, we've come all this way and
we don't even see the temple? Really?

211
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:41,536
- It's unlike anything you ever seen before.
- Yeah.

212
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:44,054
We should just go in, go once
around the first cave, and then out.

213
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,120
Yeah. Come on.

214
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,653
When was the last time you went diving?

215
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:50,459
Years ago.

216
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:52,741
- I used to go all the time with Dad,
- Perfect.

217
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:54,811
But I've never been in caves before.

218
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,115
It's like riding a bike, right? I mean...

219
00:18:59,225 --> 00:18:59,890
Come on, Mia!

220
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:00,463
Mimi!

221
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:03,474
Yeah, she's going to do it!
Let's go! Let's go, that's great!

222
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,644
- Let's go, Mia! Yes!
- Come on! We're doing it, let's go!

223
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:13,229
Hey, it's going to be fun, okay?

224
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,334
Just remember, keep your
movements nice and small.

225
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,360
Last thing you want to do
is kick up silt down there.

226
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:18,906
You won't be able to see your own hands.

227
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:20,942
Okay. You guys ready?

228
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:23,118
I'm going to lead. Keep
behind me at all times.

229
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:25,350
One circuit around the
first cave, and back.

230
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,202
Yes, teacher.

231
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,287
Nicole, I'm serious. Either
you do as I say, or...

232
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:30,922
Yeah, I hear you.

233
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,073
We don't do it at all.

234
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:50,375
Let's go, ladies. Get a move on.

235
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,518
Everyone okay? Sasha, are you good?

236
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:54,864
Yeah.

237
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:55,992
Mia?

238
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:57,389
Yeah, I'm good.

239
00:19:57,608 --> 00:20:00,665
Everybody check your air gauges.
You should all have a full tank.

240
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,975
Mine's on 100 percent.

241
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:07,482
Me too.

242
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,255
Come on, I'm getting old already!

243
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:12,344
Okay. Turn your lights on.

244
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:16,574
Follow me. The entrance is
just at the bottom of the steps.

245
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,211
Let's go.

246
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:03,925
You guys are going to freak
out. It's insane down there.

247
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:16,669
Come on!

248
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:19,634
Oh, my God. Are you sure about this?

249
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,420
Yeah, trust me.

250
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:55,326
Oh, my God! This is so crazy!

251
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,781
I can't believe we're doing this.

252
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:13,236
Look at that.

253
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:20,436
Run out of air in a cave, and your last
chance is sucking the air from those.

254
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,553
Seriously?

255
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:23,793
For sure. You want to try it?

256
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:27,500
The corridor gets narrow
up here, so single file.

257
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:37,022
Just through here.

258
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,929
You all okay?

259
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:40,962
- Yup.
- Yeah.

260
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,277
Yeah, I'm good.

261
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,841
Sasha, you could barely
get your ass through there.

262
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,692
Shut up, Nicole. At least I have an ass.

263
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:23,176
All okay? Mia?

264
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,453
- Yeah.
- Sasha?

265
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:26,003
Nicole?

266
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,489
Yes, teacher!

267
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,207
You guys ready for this?

268
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,795
Holy...

269
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:49,063
...crap!

270
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,479
That's so cool!

271
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,283
I told you guys.

272
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,988
Xibalba.

273
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,497
This place is insane, right?

274
00:23:58,975 --> 00:24:00,955
Hey. Nicole! No!

275
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:02,263
Keep behind me and keep together.

276
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,797
Okay. Okay. Okay.

277
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,714
One lap around the altar,
and then we head back, right?

278
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,751
Right.

279
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:13,393
Let's go.

280
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:23,432
Oh, my God!

281
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:23,519
They made human sacrifices here.

282
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:25,342
Creepy.

283
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:38,462
Guys, did you see that?

284
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:40,197
I think I saw something move.

285
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:43,298
There's nothing down here, Nicole.

286
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:48,779
There was something there.

287
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,706
Oh, come on, Nicole.

288
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:52,119
Maybe it was a mermaid.

289
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,262
Shut up, Sasha. I'm serious.

290
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:59,192
Come on, Nicole. Stop messing around.

291
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,936
Maybe it was my Dad.

292
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,733
Your Dad's on the other side of the city.

293
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,952
There's nothing there.
Nicole's just being an idiot.

294
00:26:05,988 --> 00:26:07,700
I heard that, Alexa.

295
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:09,495
Come on, let's just go back.

296
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,155
We said we would come in, and
then head straight back out, right?

297
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:17,148
Nicole!

298
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:26,265
Nicole?

299
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,401
Nicole, stop being an idiot.

300
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,104
Come, look, look!

301
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:55,645
Look!

302
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,131
Oh, my God!

303
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,748
Where are its eyes?

304
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,692
It doesn't have any.

305
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:06,569
It's a Mexican tetra... a blind cave fish.

306
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:08,618
Wait, I heard about these.

307
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,698
No light down here, so they
don't need color or eyes.

308
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:13,627
They evolved without.

309
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:17,294
How does it know where it's going?

310
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,404
Heightened senses.

311
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,307
I didn't know they got this big.

312
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,222
It's probably never known a human.

313
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:25,609
It's hiding from us.

314
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:29,516
Well, who says it's us it's hiding from?

315
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:31,290
Stop!

316
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:33,754
- Here, fishy fishy! Nice to meet...
- No, Nicole. I wouldn't.

317
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:36,356
No!

318
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:41,613
No, stop it from falling!

319
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:44,419
No!

320
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:58,243
Guys? Guys?

321
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:01,486
I can't hear you!

322
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:03,501
Nobody move!

323
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,325
Anyone? Nicole? Sasha, where are you?

324
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:14,471
Guys? I can't see you guys, where are you?

325
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:26,018
Sasha... I can't hear
you, guys, where are you?

326
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:28,280
Sasha!

327
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:33,364
I can't see anyone.

328
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,084
Sasha!

329
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:54,679
Sasha!

330
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:58,769
Alexa, I can't see!

331
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,262
Mia!

332
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:02,986
Mia! What are you doing here?

333
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:05,464
Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

334
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,359
- We were at the lake and...
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

335
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:10,091
- Calm down, alright? It's okay.
- It was really stupid, I'm sorry.

336
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,872
Let me guess. Alexa persuaded
you to come down here, huh?

337
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:16,364
And then we knocked over a stone column,

338
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,946
and I got totally lost in the silt.

339
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,778
You didn't think to come
down here with a guideline?

340
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:23,254
Mia! Mia! Thank God!

341
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:25,063
Oh, man, I should've known.

342
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:27,221
So you thought you'd try a
little bit of cave diving, huh?

343
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:28,932
I'm... I'm so sorry.

344
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:32,124
Honestly, we were supposed to just go
in and then straight back out again.

345
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,845
That's the last time I'm showing
you any of my secret spots.

346
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,531
I take it Sasha and Nicole are close by?

347
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:39,349
They're waiting by the exit.

348
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:40,906
Yeah? What a surprise.

349
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,384
Let's just get you guys the hell out
of here before your Dad finds out.

350
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:45,757
You're not going to tell him, are you?

351
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:47,050
Are you kidding me?

352
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:59,258
Alexa, where are the others?

353
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:04,626
MIA, FRANTICALLY: Where are
they? Sasha? Nicole? Sasha?

354
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:07,157
Mia! Where are you?

355
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:09,929
Sasha! Look they're here, they're here!

356
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,944
Guys, there's a shark.

357
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,241
Mia, what is it?

358
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,140
There's a shark. I'm serious.

359
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,568
It killed Ben.

360
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:16,394
What?

361
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,566
We have to go. We have to go now.

362
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:21,581
You're really freaking me out right now.

363
00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:24,285
Guys, if this is some kind
of joke, it's not funny.

364
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:25,323
Sasha, behind you!

365
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,590
Yeah, right.

366
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,156
Shark!

367
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:41,936
Swim! Swim! Go on!

368
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,127
Guys, come on, move! Move!

369
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,004
The tunnel is starting to
collapse. We need to hurry.

370
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:10,565
Keep going, come on, go, go!

371
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,469
Alexa!

372
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:29,754
What do I do, Alexa, what do I do?

373
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,954
Push. Help me push. Come on.

374
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:36,677
Push.

375
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,006
Help me move these rocks.

376
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:42,727
Push.

377
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:43,625
We're trapped.

378
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:45,558
There has to be a way out.

379
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:47,385
Come on.

380
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:52,111
You guys, it's pointless.
It's pointless. Alexa! Alexa!

381
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:57,588
Alexa! Look at me.

382
00:31:57,864 --> 00:32:00,938
You said Ben and my Dad went
through a different entrance.

383
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:05,080
Sasha, this place is a maze. I
would never be able to find him.

384
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:09,088
Guys! Guys, there's a line.

385
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:12,633
Ben... Ben, he had the guideline with him.

386
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:15,241
It leads back to where they were working.

387
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:16,494
What about the shark?

388
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:18,830
It looked blind. Like the tetra fish.

389
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,662
It must have evolved down here.

390
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:25,299
When my dad opened up the new
cave, it must have let him through.

391
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:27,235
Mia, was that a great white?

392
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:28,796
Yeah, I think so.

393
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:33,599
Everybody check your air.

394
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,779
I have about forty percent left.

395
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,438
What about you guys?

396
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:41,448
I have forty.

397
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:42,681
Thirty eight.

398
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:44,013
Thirty five.

399
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:48,471
Okay, we don't have much of
a choice, as far as I can see.

400
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,445
Everyone needs to stay close, okay?

401
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:53,366
But what about the shark?

402
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,073
We can do this, Alexa.
It's going to be okay.

403
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:00,682
Okay, come on. Let's go.

404
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:11,433
The guideline.

405
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,984
I can see it.

406
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:24,418
Stay close.

407
00:34:24,454 --> 00:34:26,884
If we follow the line,
it will take us to Grant.

408
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:28,662
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

409
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:20,304
The line leads down here.

410
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:34,336
This way.

411
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:43,723
Are you okay, Mia?

412
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:44,808
Yeah.

413
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:19,474
Oh, my God! What is this place?

414
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:28,053
Catacombs. This city was built
out of their burial chambers.

415
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:32,117
The line's caught on something.

416
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,452
Come on. Sasha, we need to move.

417
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,016
Guys.

418
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,526
What are we going to do?

419
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:56,011
We need to keep going.

420
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,345
We're going to die down here.

421
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:03,962
No. Grant has to be close.

422
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,331
We can't give up.

423
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:04,088
No, no, it's a dead
end. We have to go back.

424
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:06,429
There's no other way. Where
are we going to go back to?

425
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,324
We're going to run out of
air. We're going to drown.

426
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:10,737
We're going to drown!

427
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:11,982
Wait! Wait!

428
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:28,515
Where are they? Sasha, where's Dad?

429
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,503
He must be close. Grant!

430
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,078
- Dad!
- Grant!

431
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:35,368
- Dad! Where are you, Dad?
- Grant!

432
00:39:35,432 --> 00:39:37,142
- Dad!
- Grant, can you hear us?

433
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:38,580
There's another way through.

434
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,269
Get down!

435
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:15,259
Turn it off!

436
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,571
This way.

437
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,277
Keep going.

438
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,718
Go! Go now!

439
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:38,283
Come on!

440
00:41:39,482 --> 00:41:41,289
Come on, get in! Go!

441
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,605
This way!

442
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:01,436
Come on!

443
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:03,890
This way! Let's go!

444
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:06,443
Hurry! Come on!

445
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:27,253
Did the shark follow us?

446
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,085
I think we're safe here.

447
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:32,227
It's too narrow for the shark to follow.

448
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:36,282
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

449
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:45,719
Guys, the air tastes bad.

450
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,378
It's an air pocket. It's been here a while.

451
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:51,107
We can't breathe it for long.

452
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:52,176
So what do we do?

453
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:57,861
I can't see any way out of here.

454
00:43:03,486 --> 00:43:04,854
How much air do you have left?

455
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:08,467
I've got twenty two percent.

456
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:10,570
- I'm on twenty.
- Nineteen.

457
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:12,069
Twenty one.

458
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:15,290
Do you hear that?

459
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,663
Shhh. Listen. Listen.

460
00:43:20,116 --> 00:43:21,766
I think it's music.

461
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:23,507
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.

462
00:43:25,996 --> 00:43:27,428
It's coming from over here.

463
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,424
It has to be my Dad.

464
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:45,097
It's a dead end.

465
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:48,893
ALEXA, SASHA, NICOLE: Mia!

466
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,822
'The Look' by Roxette).

467
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,784
Mia! Mia, are you okay?

468
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,111
- There's a gap.
- Okay?

469
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,811
- Yeah. I can get through.
- Okay.

470
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,234
I'll let you know when
I'm on the other side.

471
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,817
No. We should stay together.

472
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:13,717
There's no point in
all of us using our air.

473
00:44:14,556 --> 00:44:15,852
Are you sure you can do this?

474
00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:17,196
- Yeah.
- Please be careful.

475
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:18,682
- Okay.
- Okay, we're going to be right here.

476
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:20,515
- Yeah.
- Okay.

477
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:32,703
Dad!

478
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:52,985
I was mid jam right now.

479
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,165
Grant?

480
00:46:00,372 --> 00:46:01,373
Ben?

481
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:26,702
Come on, guys. Seriously,
stop messing around.

482
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:33,990
Track error. Please reset.

483
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:36,439
Track error. Please reset.

484
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,082
Track error. Please reset.

485
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:43,210
Track error.

486
00:47:14,446 --> 00:47:15,447
What?

487
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:49,449
What is that?

488
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:52,200
It's an emergency alarm.

489
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,782
Designed to help locate a diver in a cave.

490
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:55,666
Dad!

491
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:17,980
I'm through.

492
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:20,747
Can you see anything?

493
00:48:21,092 --> 00:48:22,199
Dad?

494
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:29,305
I can't see anything,
but I can hear the alarm.

495
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:31,344
Carl?

496
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:36,656
Dad!

497
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:43,182
I see it! I see the alarm!

498
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:00,964
Dad!

499
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:40,734
Dad!

500
00:49:46,164 --> 00:49:47,365
Guys!

501
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,942
Guys, I can't hear you!

502
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:53,817
Dad!

503
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:59,015
Dad! Help!

504
00:50:05,723 --> 00:50:07,170
Why isn't she back yet?

505
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:14,246
Mia! Mia!

506
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:16,058
Mia!

507
00:50:21,137 --> 00:50:24,061
She's not responding.
We have to go help her.

508
00:50:24,665 --> 00:50:26,195
What if the shark got her?

509
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,229
Guys, guys, I'm lost. I can't hear you.

510
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:30,479
Can you hear me?

511
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:35,869
Guys, I can't hear you.

512
00:50:41,864 --> 00:50:43,085
Can you hear me?

513
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:01,536
What are you doing here?

514
00:51:01,572 --> 00:51:04,954
We just wanted to see the main
entrance, but then the tunnel collapsed.

515
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:08,041
Ben and Carl are both dead.

516
00:51:11,324 --> 00:51:12,469
Where's Sasha?

517
00:51:13,312 --> 00:51:14,798
We found a small air pocket.

518
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:18,001
She's back there with Alexa and
Nicole, but I can't hear them any more.

519
00:51:18,037 --> 00:51:20,901
It's because these columns are
breaking up the radio signal.

520
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:22,894
You're low on air.

521
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:36,491
- We'll get them. Follow me.
- Okay.

522
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:26,505
Mia! Mia, behind you!

523
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:31,815
Over here! Over here!

524
00:52:38,264 --> 00:52:40,161
Hey! Over here!

525
00:52:42,474 --> 00:52:44,070
Over here!

526
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:50,196
Over here! Over here!

527
00:52:58,659 --> 00:52:59,660
Swim!

528
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:10,208
This way!

529
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:56,470
Swim! Come on!

530
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,689
We did it!

531
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,363
Oh, Mia!

532
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:46,194
You guys!

533
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:47,522
I love you guys!

534
00:54:47,558 --> 00:54:49,823
- We made it!
- You saved us, Mia!

535
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,921
I thought we were going to die down there.

536
00:54:53,155 --> 00:54:55,500
Okay, girls, this is an ascender.

537
00:54:57,438 --> 00:54:59,502
You got to get yourself into this harness.

538
00:54:59,927 --> 00:55:01,427
Get your foot in this loop.

539
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:05,705
And this, you got to work up and down.

540
00:55:05,858 --> 00:55:08,480
Pump down, push up. Pump down, push up.

541
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:10,282
- Yeah.
- Okay?

542
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:12,048
- Yeah.
- We'll get out of here soon.

543
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:13,477
- Okay.
- You ready?

544
00:55:13,513 --> 00:55:15,482
- Yeah.
- Okay. Push.

545
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:19,661
Yeah! You got to use all your strength.

546
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:22,180
- Okay.
- Push and pull.

547
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:23,508
That's it, yeah!

548
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,154
I'm a natural.

549
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,161
- Alright, go back. Come on.
- Okay.

550
00:55:27,246 --> 00:55:28,776
One more time. Hard as you can.

551
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:30,848
- Yeah.
- Okay.

552
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:32,649
Okay.

553
00:55:33,152 --> 00:55:36,200
Yeah! Keep going.

554
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:41,897
Guys! Guys, there's a shark!

555
00:55:46,107 --> 00:55:47,850
Get me out of here!

556
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,977
Nicole, I can't pull us both up.

557
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:54,175
Get off, Nicole!

558
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:55,442
I got to get out of here!

559
00:55:56,472 --> 00:55:58,082
It's not going to hold both of you.

560
00:56:00,478 --> 00:56:02,442
- Let go, Nicole!
- Alexa!

561
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,261
Nicole, you got to get down!

562
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:07,481
Oh, my God, there's two sharks!

563
00:56:14,308 --> 00:56:15,538
- No!
- Alexa!

564
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,681
I got to get out of here! I'm sorry!

565
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:23,113
- No!
- Please let go!

566
00:56:27,786 --> 00:56:28,787
Alexa!

567
00:56:39,693 --> 00:56:42,039
Unhook yourself from
that harness right now!

568
00:56:42,854 --> 00:56:43,807
Unhook yourself!

569
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,748
Alexa!

570
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:47,568
- Girls!
- Mia, quick!

571
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:51,958
Help! Someone help!

572
00:57:51,994 --> 00:57:53,375
Nobody can hear you, Alexa.

573
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:55,347
Someone will hear us.

574
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,584
They'll hear this.

575
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:02,584
Help! Someone help!

576
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,108
- Help! Please!
- Alexa, no one can hear you.

577
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,814
- Turn it off!
- Girls. Girls.

578
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,599
- Shut it off!
- Don't!

579
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:13,313
Girls! Girls! Look!

580
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,840
They're gone.

581
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:28,108
Where did they go?

582
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,513
They're scared of it.

583
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:34,720
The sharks... they've evolved blind,

584
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,710
and they have a heightened
sense of hearing.

585
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:38,680
It must be the frequency.

586
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:41,144
Maybe we can use the
alarm to scare them away.

587
00:58:41,247 --> 00:58:42,423
I mean, someone's going to come looking

588
00:58:42,459 --> 00:58:44,351
for us when we don't
come back tonight, right?

589
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,701
The only people that know
where we are, are right here.

590
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:48,277
I just found the entrance to this cave.

591
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:50,336
I'm the only one who knows where it is.

592
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:53,776
And there's no way we can get
back up without the ascender.

593
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:57,456
What are we going to do?

594
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:01,388
We got to go back down.
There's no other way now.

595
00:59:01,424 --> 00:59:02,442
- What?
- What?

596
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:05,312
Listen, this cave goes out to the sea.

597
00:59:05,389 --> 00:59:07,283
If we follow it, we'll
come out in the ocean.

598
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:10,958
There'll be strong currents there
that are going to try and suck us down.

599
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:12,705
So we're going to have to keep together.

600
00:59:12,741 --> 00:59:13,616
No. We're going to die down there.

601
00:59:13,652 --> 00:59:15,417
If we stay here, we'll die.

602
00:59:15,729 --> 00:59:17,783
We're going to watch each other's backs.

603
00:59:17,908 --> 00:59:19,464
And we can survive this.

604
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,060
Okay? Girls, I believe in you.

605
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:30,681
Dad!

606
00:59:30,812 --> 00:59:32,893
Dad! Dad!

607
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:39,436
No!

608
00:59:39,472 --> 00:59:41,613
Mia, get back! Mia, get back!

609
00:59:41,649 --> 00:59:43,262
Sound the alarm!

610
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:48,062
Are they gone?

611
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:55,558
Are they gone? Can you see it?

612
00:59:55,652 --> 00:59:57,500
I don't see it. I don't see it.

613
01:00:03,029 --> 01:00:04,437
What are we going to do?

614
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,371
We have to do what he said.

615
01:00:08,503 --> 01:00:10,352
- No!
- Yes, we have to go back down.

616
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:14,364
I can't. I can't do this. I can't. I can't.

617
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,649
Mia, we have to go. We
have to do what he said.

618
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:17,522
We have to go back down.

619
01:00:17,605 --> 01:00:19,365
He wouldn't want you to give up now, okay?

620
01:00:20,087 --> 01:00:21,558
Do we even have enough air?

621
01:00:23,972 --> 01:00:24,973
We have no choice.

622
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:26,949
What if we're wrong?

623
01:00:27,063 --> 01:00:30,418
What if the alarm has nothing to
do with why the sharks are gone?

624
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:31,526
We got to try.

625
01:00:35,137 --> 01:00:36,138
You ready?

626
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:59,709
I can't see them. Where did they go?

627
01:02:00,993 --> 01:02:03,820
Wait. Current!

628
01:02:24,698 --> 01:02:26,650
Sasha! Give me your hand!

629
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,261
No!

630
01:02:43,615 --> 01:02:44,665
Help me!

631
01:02:44,959 --> 01:02:46,750
No! No!

632
01:02:46,802 --> 01:02:48,802
Give me your hand! Come on, I got you.

633
01:02:48,923 --> 01:02:50,126
Help!

634
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:55,507
Come on, I got you. Come on.

635
01:02:59,718 --> 01:03:01,980
I can't hold on!

636
01:03:02,104 --> 01:03:03,588
The current is too strong!

637
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:06,171
Come on! Hold on! Give me your hand!

638
01:03:06,207 --> 01:03:08,375
- I can't hold on!
- Mia, help! I'm falling!

639
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:15,153
Mia! I'm slipping!

640
01:03:17,306 --> 01:03:18,873
Hold on, Sasha, come on.

641
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:28,215
No! No!

642
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:29,135
Sasha!

643
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:31,934
No! No! Mia!

644
01:03:35,303 --> 01:03:36,547
Sasha!

645
01:03:43,855 --> 01:03:45,325
Sasha!

646
01:03:47,454 --> 01:03:48,904
Sasha!

647
01:04:05,514 --> 01:04:08,067
No! Sasha!

648
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:11,925
Mia! Mia, she's dead.
There's nothing you can do.

649
01:04:11,961 --> 01:04:13,505
No, you don't know that.

650
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:14,567
Mia, look at me.

651
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:16,654
I'm going.

652
01:04:16,794 --> 01:04:18,025
Mia, look at me.

653
01:04:18,407 --> 01:04:21,374
We have to keep going, or we
are going to die down here.

654
01:04:21,618 --> 01:04:23,278
Do you understand me?

655
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,380
No!

656
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:34,042
Look. Over there.

657
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:35,710
That's the way out.

658
01:04:36,469 --> 01:04:38,963
The current is going to drag us down.

659
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:46,103
We'll be okay if we stick to the side.

660
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:48,137
It's our only chance. Okay?

661
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,124
Okay? I won't leave you.

662
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,078
Grab my hand. Let's go.

663
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:33,233
You okay?

664
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:50,813
Keep moving.

665
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:55,418
Almost there.

666
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,167
Mia! Give me your hand!

667
01:05:59,203 --> 01:06:00,887
- Alexa!
- Give me your hand!

668
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,860
I'm coming. I'm coming.

669
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,048
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

670
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:10,020
I got you! I got you!

671
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:17,656
Are you okay?

672
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,481
Mia, this has to be the way out.

673
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:41,632
We're almost there.

674
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,125
The exit can't be far.

675
01:06:48,016 --> 01:06:48,779
Alexa!

676
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:03,016
Oh, my God, you're alive!

677
01:08:05,116 --> 01:08:06,419
You're alive!

678
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:07,787
We're trapped, Mia!

679
01:08:10,183 --> 01:08:13,845
Mia, we're going to
die. There's no way out.

680
01:08:15,336 --> 01:08:18,431
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

681
01:08:18,566 --> 01:08:19,266
Don't be.

682
01:08:19,302 --> 01:08:22,902
No, no! It's my fault. If it
wasn't for me, you wouldn't be here.

683
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,478
Stop! You stop it, okay?

684
01:08:27,513 --> 01:08:28,824
We can't give up now.

685
01:08:30,007 --> 01:08:33,192
We can share air. I have
a little more than you.

686
01:08:33,953 --> 01:08:35,256
Five percent.

687
01:08:35,621 --> 01:08:37,358
We're not going to die down here.

688
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:43,310
- Look!
- Where are you going? Mia?

689
01:08:59,489 --> 01:09:00,654
Sasha, come here.

690
01:09:04,081 --> 01:09:06,768
Look. Maybe there's a way through.

691
01:09:08,836 --> 01:09:11,444
The current is too
strong, it'll drag us down.

692
01:09:12,535 --> 01:09:13,737
We have to try.

693
01:10:41,516 --> 01:10:42,667
It's a dead end.

694
01:10:44,099 --> 01:10:45,450
No, it can't be.

695
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,432
There! Come on!

696
01:11:13,299 --> 01:11:14,868
I think I can see the sunlight.

697
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:18,212
It's too narrow to climb through.

698
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:19,873
There must be another way.

699
01:11:34,694 --> 01:11:37,977
It's circling. Oh, my God! Mia!

700
01:11:38,156 --> 01:11:40,452
Mia! I'm stuck!

701
01:11:43,307 --> 01:11:44,807
Mia! It's coming!

702
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:56,688
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

703
01:12:12,881 --> 01:12:16,468
Keep going. We can do it. We can make it.

704
01:12:18,346 --> 01:12:21,232
Just keep going. We're almost there.

705
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,520
Come on, Mia!

706
01:12:29,154 --> 01:12:32,581
Come on, Mia! Keep going!

707
01:12:41,081 --> 01:12:42,866
Come on, Mia.

708
01:12:43,036 --> 01:12:44,190
I see light.

709
01:12:52,064 --> 01:12:54,895
Come on. We're so close.

710
01:12:56,753 --> 01:12:57,882
Mia, I'm stuck.

711
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:02,341
We're so close.

712
01:13:07,564 --> 01:13:09,094
I have to take my pack off.

713
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:12,442
Come on.

714
01:13:24,614 --> 01:13:25,816
Hold your breath.

715
01:13:45,816 --> 01:13:46,818
Help!

716
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:50,200
Help!

717
01:14:30,954 --> 01:14:34,407
Oh, my God! Mia! Mia!

718
01:14:34,534 --> 01:14:38,783
Mia! We made it! We did it!

719
01:15:00,702 --> 01:15:02,060
There has to be a way up.

720
01:15:04,749 --> 01:15:06,924
Maybe, maybe we could climb it.
