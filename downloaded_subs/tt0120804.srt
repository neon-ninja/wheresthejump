1
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,277
At the beginning of
the 21st century

2
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:40,529
the Umbrella Corporation
had become

3
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:42,781
the largest commercial entity
in the U.S.

4
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:45,951
Nine out of every ten homes
contain its products.

5
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:49,705
Its political and financial
influence is felt everywhere.

6
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:53,167
In public, it is the world's
leading supplier of...

7
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:56,962
computer technology, medical
products and healthcare.

8
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,173
Unknown even to
its own employees,

9
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,383
its massive profíts
are generated by...

10
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,927
military technology,

11
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:06,096
genetic experimentation
and viral weaponry.

12
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:56,415
All Umbrella staff must
wear their identity tags...

13
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:58,751
at all times.

14
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,377
All radiation badges...

15
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:03,672
will be collected
at 5 this afternoon.

16
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:05,132
Thank you!

17
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:06,634
God!

18
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,429
Some people.

19
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,379
- Don't show me.
- Why not?

20
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,339
Because I'm busy.

21
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,806
It's nothing. Fire drill.

22
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,819
- What is that?
- Fire drill.

23
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,242
- Shit!
- What's going on?

24
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:16,245
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- I'm trying!

25
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:18,330
Move the experiments!

26
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:31,176
Shouldn't the doors open
or something?

27
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,888
It's supposed to take us
to the nearest floor.

28
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:40,227
Hello?

29
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:42,479
Hello?

30
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:44,356
What's happening?

31
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:48,611
Line's dead.

32
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,655
Is that a drill? Come on!

33
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,074
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.

34
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,702
- The ones at the back?
- Locked as well.

35
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,663
There's no fire here!
No fire!

36
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:04,335
- There's no fire here! No fire!
- The code doesn't work!

37
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,503
- What's wrong with you?
- The door won't open!

38
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,714
- And this water isn't going anywhere.
- What?

39
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,633
It's a sealed room.

40
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,302
- Help me with the door!
- Fuck the doors!

41
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,104
We have to get out of here.

42
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:26,190
What's going on?

43
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:30,736
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.

44
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,863
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!

45
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,906
Quiet!

46
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:36,784
Quiet.

47
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:39,370
What is that?

48
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:55,886
Oh, my God!

49
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,335
Halon!

50
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:34,300
Stop it!

51
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:37,636
Stop it! Stop!

52
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,965
Let me see.

53
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:24,892
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building.

54
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:26,894
Here, give me a hand.

55
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:31,106
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.

56
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:33,776
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through.

57
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:35,611
I'll get help.

58
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,954
I'm stuck. You'll have to push.

59
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,041
That's it. A bit more.

60
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:52,461
What was that?

61
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:56,632
Oh, Christ!
It's the brakes!

62
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,927
- Get out! We have to get out!
- I can't move!

63
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:02,221
I can't move!

64
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:09,061
Oh, my God!

65
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:11,939
- Push her out of the way!
- Pull me back inside!

66
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,191
Pull me back inside!

67
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:18,028
Pull me back inside!

68
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:26,699
Today all your dreams come true.

69
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,247
Today all your...

70
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:45,778
Hello?

71
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:40,541
Hello?

72
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:05,232
Who are you?

73
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:08,235
Don't touch me.
Get away from me!

74
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:09,320
Down!

75
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,292
What are you doing? I'm a cop!

76
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,212
I told you. I'm a cop.

77
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,470
You're breaking my arm.

78
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,270
Report.

79
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:48,567
Report now.

80
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:49,944
What?

81
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:53,489
I want your report, soldier.

82
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:55,658
I don't know
what you're talking about.

83
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:59,078
Sir, the house's primary
defenses were activated.

84
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,789
She's probably suffering
side effects.

85
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:05,042
- What are you doing with us?
- What about the cop?

86
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,045
Matthew Addison.
I'm not getting a match.

87
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:10,172
Who are you?

88
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:13,425
I just transferred. They probably
don't have me on file yet.

89
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:15,636
The locals are inefficient.
It's possible.

90
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:17,846
Should I secure him here?

91
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:24,019
No. We take him with us.

92
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,606
You can't do this.

93
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,152
Blow me.

94
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,240
Prep for entry to the Hive.

95
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,769
- Power's down.
- So fix it.

96
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:48,103
I'm on it.

97
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,245
Are you done yet?

98
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:48,163
Jumpy!

99
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:01,677
Stand clear!

100
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,835
- You got a pro blem?
- How's that door?

101
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:36,962
- Sealed shut.
- Let me.

102
00:17:52,728 --> 00:17:54,063
Jumpy?

103
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,096
Lie still.

104
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,181
Lie still!

105
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:31,934
Watch this light.

106
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,769
Follow it.

107
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,567
- How many fingers?
- Three.

108
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,111
Good. Tell me your name.

109
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,159
I don't know.

110
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:53,247
He's fine.
Memory loss, like the other one.

111
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:35,539
Let's open that door.

112
00:19:57,603 --> 00:20:01,190
I want to know who you people are
and what's going on here.

113
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,653
Now!

114
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:12,076
You and I have the same employer.
We work for the Umbrella Corporation.

115
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:15,412
The mansion above is an
emergency entrance to the Hive.

116
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:19,291
You were security operatives
placed there to protect that entrance.

117
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,460
What a bout this?

118
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:24,296
Your marriage is a fake.

119
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:27,716
Just your cover to protect
the secrecy of the Hive.

120
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,635
And what is the Hive?

121
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:31,428
Show them.

122
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:35,766
Accessing schematic
of the Hive.

123
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,394
Raccoon City,
nearest urban center.

124
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:42,773
The mansion, where we found you
and gained access to the train...

125
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,402
which, in turn,
brought us to the Hive.

126
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,447
The Hive is located underground...

127
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:53,367
deep beneath the streets
of Raccoon City.

128
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:57,872
A secret research facility
owned and operated

129
00:20:58,038 --> 00:20:59,665
by the Umbrella Corporation...

130
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:04,044
The Hive houses over 500 technicians,
scientists and support staff.

131
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:07,631
They live and work underground.

132
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:10,509
Their research is of
the highest importance.

133
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,845
Its nature is classifíed.

134
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:17,600
Our position on the map
is indicated by heat signature.

135
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,365
Why can't I remember anything?

136
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:37,411
The Hive has its own defense
mechanisms, all computer-controlled.

137
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:41,540
A nerve gas was released
into the house.

138
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,503
Primary effect of the gas:

139
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,673
Complete unconsciousness
lasting up to four hours.

140
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,385
Secondary effects can include
acute memory loss.

141
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:57,389
- For how long?
- Subjective. An hour, day, week.

142
00:21:58,057 --> 00:21:59,850
So, this place was attacked?

143
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:03,979
I'm afraid things are a little
more complicated than that.

144
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:07,233
Sir, we've breached the Hive.

145
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:18,577
J.D.

146
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:47,940
Got it.

147
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:02,288
Halon has dissipated.

148
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:25,185
Easier to work underground,
thinking there's a view.

149
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,751
Looks like we're taking the stairs.

150
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:00,137
Status.

151
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:04,141
Red Queen's locked on to us.
She knows we're here.

152
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,102
Who's the Red Queen?

153
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:09,271
State-of-the-art
artificial intelligence.

154
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:12,316
The computer
that controls the Hive.

155
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:27,873
This will slow us down.

156
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,835
Our route to the Queen takes us
straight through these labs.

157
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:35,297
Rain, J.D.,
see how bad the flooding is.

158
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,050
Kaplan, find an alternate route.

159
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,389
What happened here?

160
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:49,603
Five hours ago,
Red Queen went homicidal.

161
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,772
Sealed the Hive
and killed everyone here.

162
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:52,648
Jesus.

163
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:56,110
When we realized what happened,
we were dispatched to shut her down.

164
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,613
- Why did she do it?
- We don't know.

165
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:03,200
But outside interference
is a possibility.

166
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:04,827
Jesus!

167
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:21,886
You okay?

168
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,683
Here.

169
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,603
- No, I'm fine.
- It's cold in here.

170
00:25:40,154 --> 00:25:40,905
Are you...?

171
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:46,702
Do you remember anything from...

172
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:49,038
before this?

173
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:55,419
No, nothing before the train.

174
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:58,923
And you?

175
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,053
Nothing.

176
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:07,181
I found an alternate route
but it will cost us time.

177
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:12,561
If we double back, cut through
Dining Hall B, we're right on track.

178
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:31,163
Sir, no go.
The whole level's flooded.

179
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:32,998
All right,
we're behind schedule.

180
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,626
So let's move it.

181
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:43,175
Come on.

182
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,934
Poor bastards.

183
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:39,857
Kaplan?

184
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:42,902
Dining Hall B.
That's what's on the map.

185
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:45,613
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

186
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:48,449
May be the Corporation
keeps secrets here,

187
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:51,201
something you're not
supposed to see.

188
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:55,706
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner
here and secure the exit.

189
00:27:56,373 --> 00:28:00,878
Halon levels are nonexistent.
I think the system malfunctioned.

190
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:05,674
There may be survivors. Give me
a search line but keep it tight.

191
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:10,971
Move it.

192
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:05,859
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.

193
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:11,198
I'm not sure I want to remember
what went on down here.

194
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:16,829
I don't blame you.

195
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:21,166
- What the hell do they keep in these?
- How do I know?

196
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:48,986
What's taking so long?

197
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:53,240
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.

198
00:29:57,953 --> 00:29:59,121
Let's pack it up.

199
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:13,719
You. Stay here.

200
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,339
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.

201
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:11,860
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.

202
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,113
Running a bypass.

203
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,092
Checkmate.

204
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,561
Move up.

205
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:52,151
What is that?

206
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,655
That will shut the Queen down.
Delivers a massive electrical charge.

207
00:31:56,822 --> 00:31:58,866
Forces the mainframe to re boot.

208
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:04,455
Kaplan!

209
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:12,338
A dormant defense mechanism.
We must've tripped it.

210
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:14,757
- Put it back to sleep.
- Working on it.

211
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:20,804
- Open that door.
- I'm trying.

212
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,057
Hold your positions.
Stay calm.

213
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:24,391
What's that?

214
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:29,647
- Get them out!
- Something's happening in there.

215
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:31,273
- Come on.
- Help them!

216
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,525
Down! Get down!

217
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:38,948
- Something's killing them!
- Don't do this!

218
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,952
Medic! Medic!

219
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:54,547
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!

220
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:58,092
You're going into shock.
Stay awake!

221
00:32:58,592 --> 00:32:59,635
Almost there.

222
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:01,929
It's coming back!

223
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:03,639
- Open it!
- I'm trying!

224
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:05,015
Try harder!

225
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:07,768
It's coming back!

226
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:16,902
Oh, God!

227
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,572
- Do it!
- Almost there.

228
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:21,907
Come on!

229
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:25,953
- Shit.
- Got it.

230
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,938
All right.

231
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:55,190
Let's do it.

232
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:59,820
- Do what?
- We have to complete the mission.

233
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,031
No way I'll go down there.

234
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,492
Her defenses are down.

235
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,745
Déja vu, anyone?

236
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:11,267
Keep going.

237
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:47,344
Give me a hand.

238
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,154
Get out!
You can't be in here.

239
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:09,241
Don't listen. She's a holographic
representation of the Red Queen.

240
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,659
Get out!

241
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:12,703
Modeled after
the programmer's daughter.

242
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,539
She'll deceive us, confuse us.

243
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,208
I wouldn't advise this.

244
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:20,211
Disabling me will result
in loss of primary power.

245
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,838
She'll say anything to stop us
from shutting her down.

246
00:36:23,797 --> 00:36:25,716
I implore you.

247
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:28,761
- Implore away.
- Please?

248
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:31,680
Please?

249
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,393
You're all going to die down here.

250
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,789
That pulse forces
the circuit breaker

251
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,791
to shut down her mainframe
for 30 seconds.

252
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:43,878
After that, if I don't have
her boards, he can re boot.

253
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:55,347
They're late.

254
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:05,900
I'm on it.

255
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:55,824
J.D., we got a survivor!

256
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:58,619
We're here to help.

257
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:02,623
You seem to be in some sort of...

258
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:07,461
Get off!

259
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:09,213
Get off of me!

260
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:13,676
Get her off me
before I stab her ass.

261
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,347
You okay?

262
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:22,935
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk right out of me.

263
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:28,857
Stay back.
I'm warning you, stay down!

264
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,984
She's crazy.

265
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,488
Come any closer and I'll fire.

266
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:37,867
I mean it!

267
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,203
Damn you!

268
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:04,768
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?

269
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:07,062
Bitch isn't standing now.

270
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:15,446
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.

271
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:19,950
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.

272
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,996
She's gone.
She's gone!

273
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:26,790
Bullshit!

274
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,293
She fell right here
but she's gone!

275
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:35,841
Look at this.
There's blood, but it's not much.

276
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,386
Looks coagulated.

277
00:40:40,012 --> 00:40:40,971
Yeah.

278
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,557
It's not possi ble.

279
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:45,309
Why not?

280
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:49,772
Blood doesn't do that
till after you're dead.

281
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:51,148
Can we go now?

282
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,901
Not till the rest of
the team get here.

283
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:01,951
There's no one else coming.

284
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:05,412
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Wait.

285
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,164
Quiet.

286
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,370
- Fuck!
- Don't come any closer!

287
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,955
They're behind us!

288
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,039
Jesus!

289
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:53,502
They're everywhere.

290
00:41:54,336 --> 00:41:57,006
They're everywhere.
They're all around us.

291
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,113
I said stay back!

292
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,458
Why aren't they dying?

293
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:44,011
Watch the tank!
The tank!

294
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:53,854
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

295
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:56,273
- Wait!
- Come on! Move!

296
00:42:56,482 --> 00:42:57,358
Come on!

297
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:03,197
Move.

298
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:19,213
I can help you get the virus.
I have security codes...

299
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,757
surveillance plans, the works.

300
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:40,776
Shit.

301
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:50,536
- We lost the others.
- Keep moving.

302
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,964
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.

303
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,507
Come on.

304
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:05,467
- Shit!
- Come on!

305
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,066
- Hurry up.
- Shit!

306
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:22,818
- Come on.
- Shit!

307
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,989
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!

308
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:45,174
Come on.

309
00:44:48,177 --> 00:44:51,597
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry, I'm running out of ammo!

310
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:53,849
0-43-2... No, fuck!

311
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:57,144
- What?!
- 0-43...

312
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:59,563
- What is the code?
- 0-4...

313
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,191
0-3-1...

314
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:03,984
9-6-5.

315
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:07,821
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?

316
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,949
Shit!

317
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:16,038
Grab my hand, man!

318
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,249
Don't let go!

319
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,521
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go? Fuck!

320
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:28,360
Whatever they are,
there's too many.

321
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:32,031
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.

322
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,993
La b coats, badges...
Those people used to work here.

323
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,329
All the people
working here are dead.

324
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,624
That isn't stopping them
from walking around.

325
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:45,211
Where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?

326
00:46:45,794 --> 00:46:49,590
When you cut the power, you unlocked
the doors. You let them out.

327
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,186
We're never gonna make it
to the surface.

328
00:49:03,891 --> 00:49:06,352
You are security operatives...

329
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:08,604
placed there to protect
that entrance.

330
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:37,253
Lisa.

331
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:07,992
I've got one in the breech.
And an extra mag.

332
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:06,842
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes...

333
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,637
surveillance plans, the works.

334
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:11,263
But?

335
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,183
- But there will be a price.
- Name it

336
00:53:21,106 --> 00:53:23,359
- Who was she?
- My sister.

337
00:53:32,535 --> 00:53:35,412
Corporations like Umbrella...

338
00:53:36,163 --> 00:53:37,998
think they're above the law.

339
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,292
But they're not.

340
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:48,676
There are hundreds of thousands of us
who think the same all over the world.

341
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:54,640
Some of us provide information.

342
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:57,643
Others give their support.

343
00:53:59,186 --> 00:54:01,230
Some take more direct action.

344
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,607
Like you.

345
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:08,070
If your friends had been
more thorough,

346
00:54:08,237 --> 00:54:10,364
they would've seen
through my false I.D.

347
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:15,286
Then all the red flags
would've gone off.

348
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:19,373
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP,
all the rest.

349
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:24,169
There's no way I could've
infiltrated the Hive.

350
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:27,047
So you sent your sister.

351
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,429
We needed something concrete,

352
00:54:33,596 --> 00:54:36,265
anything to expose Um brella
to the press.

353
00:54:36,724 --> 00:54:39,435
Proof of the research
going on down here.

354
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,187
What kind of research?

355
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,315
The illegal kind.

356
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:46,942
Genetic.

357
00:54:48,235 --> 00:54:49,528
Viral.

358
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:55,117
My sister was going to
smuggle out

359
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:58,037
a sample of the virus
they were developing.

360
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:03,000
How was she going to
make it out?

361
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:08,380
She had a contact within the Hive,
someone I never met.

362
00:55:08,797 --> 00:55:13,302
They had access to security codes,
surveillance, everything she needed.

363
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:16,055
So why didn't she make it?

364
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:20,392
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.

365
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:23,312
Maybe they set her up.

366
00:55:24,104 --> 00:55:26,065
Kept the virus for themselves.

367
00:55:28,234 --> 00:55:32,321
Do you have any idea what the T-virus
would be worth on the open market?

368
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:34,740
Worth all this?

369
00:55:35,074 --> 00:55:36,408
Yeah.

370
00:55:36,951 --> 00:55:38,327
To someone.

371
00:55:46,293 --> 00:55:48,587
- Don't shoot!
- Close that door!

372
00:55:48,754 --> 00:55:51,215
- They're right behind us!
- Close that door!

373
00:55:53,634 --> 00:55:54,969
Get off!

374
00:55:58,806 --> 00:56:00,015
Son of a bitch!

375
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,309
You okay?

376
00:56:02,643 --> 00:56:03,686
Yeah.

377
00:56:04,144 --> 00:56:07,147
Right behind us.
What about this door?

378
00:56:07,523 --> 00:56:09,191
They're waiting there too.

379
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:11,569
And that way?

380
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:15,155
Dead end. There's no way
out of the Queen's chamber.

381
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,659
So we wait.
Someone doesn't hear from you...

382
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:21,704
they'll send backup or something.
Right?

383
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:28,127
What? What's wrong?

384
00:56:28,794 --> 00:56:32,798
- We don't have much time.
- Those blast doors we passed...

385
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:36,719
on the way in from the mansion,
they seal shut in under an hour.

386
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,931
If we're not out by then,
we're not getting out.

387
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,474
What are you talking about?

388
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:45,477
They can't just bury us
alive down here.

389
00:56:48,814 --> 00:56:52,902
Containing the incident is
the only fail-safe plan they had...

390
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:56,447
against possible contamination.

391
00:56:58,324 --> 00:57:01,452
And you're telling us this now,
when we're trapped...

392
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,287
half a mile underground?

393
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,040
We have to find a way
out of this room.

394
00:57:09,335 --> 00:57:10,961
What are you doing?

395
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:17,259
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.

396
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:20,137
- That's not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.

397
00:57:25,726 --> 00:57:27,436
That homicidal bitch killed my team.

398
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:31,065
That homicidal bitch may be
our only way out of here.

399
00:57:31,232 --> 00:57:33,150
Considering the way
she's been treated,

400
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,194
I'm sure she's real happy
to help us out.

401
00:57:35,361 --> 00:57:38,572
That circuit breaker you were
talking about. Can you bypass it?

402
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:40,282
- Yeah?
- So do it.

403
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:48,958
Circuit breaker's disabled.

404
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:53,921
This time, if I hit the switch,
she won't shut down. She'll fry.

405
00:57:59,635 --> 00:58:01,887
The charge must've damaged
her boards.

406
00:58:02,054 --> 00:58:03,430
There you are.

407
00:58:03,597 --> 00:58:07,351
Things, I gather,
have gone out of control.

408
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:10,646
Give me that switch right now.
I'll fry your ass!

409
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:13,357
I did warn you, didn't I?

410
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:17,903
- Tell us what's going on down here.
- Research and development.

411
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,572
What a bout the T-virus?

412
00:58:19,738 --> 00:58:22,616
The T-virus was a major
medical breakthrough.

413
00:58:22,783 --> 00:58:24,869
Although it clearly
also possessed...

414
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,205
highly profitable
military applications.

415
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:30,416
How does it explain
those things out there?

416
00:58:30,624 --> 00:58:33,460
Even in death, the human body
remains active.

417
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:35,880
Hair and fingernails
continue to grow.

418
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:38,257
New cells are produced.

419
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:41,427
And the brain holds
a small electrical charge

420
00:58:41,594 --> 00:58:43,721
that takes months to dissipate.

421
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,976
The T-virus provides a massive jolt,
both to cellular growth...

422
00:58:49,184 --> 00:58:52,187
and to those trace
electrical impulses.

423
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:56,108
Put quite simply,
it reanimates the body.

424
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:58,819
It brings the dead back to life?

425
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:03,532
Not fully. The subjects have
the simplest of motor functions.

426
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:07,953
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.

427
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:13,042
They are driven by the basest of
impulses, the most basic of needs.

428
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:16,086
- Which is?
- The need to feed.

429
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:22,801
How do you kill them?

430
00:59:22,968 --> 00:59:25,095
Severing the top of
the spinal column...

431
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,724
or massive trauma to the brain
are the most effective methods.

432
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,518
You mean shoot them
in the head.

433
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:33,896
Why did you kill
everybody down here?

434
00:59:34,313 --> 00:59:37,691
The T-virus escaped
into the air conditioning system.

435
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:41,403
And an uncontrolled pattern
of infection began.

436
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,364
The virus is protean,

437
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:46,909
changing from liquid to airborne
to blood transmission...

438
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:51,956
depending on its environment
It's almost impossible to kill.

439
00:59:52,248 --> 00:59:54,792
I couldn't allow it to escape
from the Hive.

440
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:58,045
So, I took steps.

441
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:01,465
- Steps?
- You must understand...

442
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:05,803
those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.

443
01:00:06,178 --> 01:00:08,430
- We're not infected.
- Just one bite...

444
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:11,850
one scratch from these creatures
is sufficient...

445
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:14,770
and then you become one of them.

446
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:21,235
A check of my systems indicates
my main drive circuit breaker...

447
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,112
has been disabled.

448
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,322
May I ask why?

449
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:28,117
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.

450
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,744
If you refuse to help,
we flip the switch.

451
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:32,621
Understand?

452
01:00:43,716 --> 01:00:45,050
After you.

453
01:00:54,602 --> 01:00:56,395
What the hell is this place?

454
01:00:56,562 --> 01:00:57,855
The utility tunnels.

455
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:01,066
They run underneath the Hive
for water, gas and power lines.

456
01:01:14,622 --> 01:01:16,916
- Been in here before.
- Keep moving!

457
01:01:17,082 --> 01:01:19,960
- Going round in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave.

458
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:22,213
- I don't know why you listen to her.
- Enough!

459
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:24,089
We have no choice
but to keep moving

460
01:01:24,256 --> 01:01:25,799
because those things
are behind us, got it?

461
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,767
That mesh won't hold.
Keep moving.

462
01:01:38,604 --> 01:01:39,438
Jesus Christ!

463
01:01:39,605 --> 01:01:41,815
- Hold it!
- There's too many of them!

464
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:46,028
Fuck!

465
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,544
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!

466
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:04,505
Quickly, everyone, up on the pipes!

467
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:06,799
- Let's go!
- Come on, there's a way up!

468
01:02:07,132 --> 01:02:08,759
Keep them back!

469
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,221
Go on up, move it!

470
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:19,853
Look out!

471
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,864
Get over here.
There's too many of them!

472
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:32,241
Go, go, go!

473
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:33,701
Go on!

474
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:37,621
I can manage!

475
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,124
Go!

476
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:58,726
JD?

477
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,252
What?

478
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:28,047
We have to do something
a bout your wounds.

479
01:03:29,256 --> 01:03:30,549
I'm fine.

480
01:03:32,468 --> 01:03:33,928
I said I'm fine.

481
01:03:41,435 --> 01:03:43,187
You like that, don't you?

482
01:03:45,397 --> 01:03:47,399
You like the way it tastes,
don't you?

483
01:03:49,944 --> 01:03:51,737
Like the taste of that?

484
01:03:59,912 --> 01:04:01,413
She was right.

485
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,336
- We're all going to die down here.
- No.

486
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:09,046
We're getting out.

487
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:11,465
All of us.

488
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:56,677
You okay?

489
01:05:13,194 --> 01:05:14,195
God!

490
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,078
Get away!

491
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,290
- Hold on!
- Come on!

492
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:39,637
Help him.

493
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:42,890
- I can't.
- What are you waiting for?

494
01:05:43,265 --> 01:05:44,808
I can't focus.

495
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:49,939
I can't see!

496
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:57,947
- Go up!
- Clim b up there!

497
01:05:59,031 --> 01:06:00,449
You gotta keep going!

498
01:06:00,741 --> 01:06:02,576
- Come on!
- Go!

499
01:06:02,743 --> 01:06:05,746
- You can do it! Move!
- You got it!

500
01:06:08,165 --> 01:06:11,085
- Stay there.
- We'll get you.

501
01:06:11,252 --> 01:06:14,838
We need to cut this wire and throw it
to him. Then we'll get him.

502
01:06:15,297 --> 01:06:16,382
Hold on.

503
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:23,889
That's lucky.

504
01:06:27,393 --> 01:06:28,936
I want you to go.

505
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:36,527
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are.

506
01:06:37,945 --> 01:06:39,780
You can't kill all of them.

507
01:06:41,115 --> 01:06:43,033
I'm not going anywhere.

508
01:06:43,993 --> 01:06:46,120
I want you to go, now!

509
01:06:46,787 --> 01:06:48,998
Please, just do it.

510
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,210
Just do it now!

511
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:54,628
Please!

512
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:57,590
Go!

513
01:07:25,534 --> 01:07:27,828
You'll have to work
for your meal!

514
01:08:00,152 --> 01:08:01,445
Come on.

515
01:08:10,704 --> 01:08:13,541
Give me your arm, okay?
Over my shoulder.

516
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:15,876
Ready?
Here we go.

517
01:08:57,585 --> 01:08:59,378
When I get out of here...

518
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:02,756
I think I'll get laid.

519
01:09:04,091 --> 01:09:06,385
You might want to clean up first.

520
01:09:15,144 --> 01:09:16,395
Wait.

521
01:09:22,193 --> 01:09:23,319
Are you okay?

522
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:12,493
Blue for the virus,
green forthe antivirus.

523
01:10:13,827 --> 01:10:16,539
Blue for the virus,
green forthe antivirus.

524
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,709
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking a bout?

525
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,920
There's a cure.

526
01:10:24,672 --> 01:10:26,549
The process can be reversed.

527
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:30,219
There's a cure!
You'll be okay.

528
01:10:32,471 --> 01:10:34,390
I was beginning to worry.

529
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:44,775
This is where they kept
the T-virus.

530
01:10:46,569 --> 01:10:48,487
How do you know all this?

531
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,492
Because I was going to steal it.

532
01:10:56,412 --> 01:10:58,080
I was your sister's contact.

533
01:11:00,749 --> 01:11:02,585
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.

534
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:04,795
- You caused all this.
- I can't remem ber.

535
01:11:06,171 --> 01:11:09,216
- The truth.
- I don't remember the truth.

536
01:11:44,043 --> 01:11:45,586
I don't understand.

537
01:11:48,714 --> 01:11:50,049
It's gone.

538
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:52,468
It's gone. It's not there.

539
01:11:54,011 --> 01:11:55,304
I can't.

540
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,682
I just can't. It's over.

541
01:12:07,816 --> 01:12:11,278
I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes...

542
01:12:11,445 --> 01:12:13,614
surveillance plans, the works.

543
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,908
But there's a price.

544
01:12:17,826 --> 01:12:19,119
Name it

545
01:12:19,328 --> 01:12:23,666
You have to guarantee me that
you'll bring this corporation down.

546
01:12:31,924 --> 01:12:33,884
Today all your dreams
come true...

547
01:12:42,017 --> 01:12:42,768
Spence?

548
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:45,354
Spence?

549
01:13:03,163 --> 01:13:04,373
Thank you!

550
01:13:15,259 --> 01:13:15,926
Spence?

551
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,579
We can still make it out of here.

552
01:13:44,163 --> 01:13:45,497
Come with me.

553
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:50,211
We can have everything
we've ever wanted.

554
01:13:50,878 --> 01:13:52,630
Money's out there waiting.

555
01:13:53,464 --> 01:13:56,008
You wouldn't believe how much.

556
01:13:56,592 --> 01:13:59,887
Is that how you thought
all my dreams would come true?

557
01:14:01,722 --> 01:14:02,806
Please.

558
01:14:03,057 --> 01:14:04,975
I wouldn't want to shoot you.

559
01:14:05,643 --> 01:14:07,603
Might need the bullets.

560
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:11,148
Back off!

561
01:14:16,195 --> 01:14:18,197
I won't take any part in this.

562
01:14:18,489 --> 01:14:22,576
Okay, but you can't just
wash your hands of this.

563
01:14:23,536 --> 01:14:26,247
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.

564
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:28,499
I was trying to stop them.

565
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,835
You really believe that...

566
01:14:33,587 --> 01:14:36,507
people like him will ever
change anything?

567
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:41,971
Nothing ever...

568
01:14:42,513 --> 01:14:43,639
changes.

569
01:14:44,515 --> 01:14:45,683
Where...

570
01:14:46,016 --> 01:14:47,434
Where is...

571
01:14:48,727 --> 01:14:50,020
the antivirus?

572
01:14:50,646 --> 01:14:51,939
It's on the train...

573
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:54,984
where you found me.

574
01:14:57,444 --> 01:15:00,030
Couldn't have been standing
more than three feet from it.

575
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:03,868
I so nearly made it out.

576
01:15:06,328 --> 01:15:08,747
I didn't realize that
bitch of a computer...

577
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:11,208
had defense systems outside the Hive.

578
01:15:13,252 --> 01:15:14,503
In or out?

579
01:15:16,297 --> 01:15:17,298
In?

580
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:18,841
Or out?

581
01:15:19,592 --> 01:15:21,468
I don't know what we had.

582
01:15:22,303 --> 01:15:23,637
But it's over.

583
01:15:30,519 --> 01:15:31,604
Back...

584
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:35,316
the fuck off!

585
01:15:46,994 --> 01:15:48,913
I'm missing you already.

586
01:15:58,297 --> 01:16:00,299
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.

587
01:16:00,883 --> 01:16:03,344
He shot the locking mechanism out.

588
01:16:04,178 --> 01:16:07,514
I can't believe that son of a bitch
is going to get away with this.

589
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,475
I don't think so.

590
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,356
I've been a bad, bad girl.

591
01:17:15,499 --> 01:17:16,917
Oh, my God.

592
01:17:32,266 --> 01:17:34,602
What the fuck is that?

593
01:17:35,019 --> 01:17:37,396
One of the Hive's
early experiments.

594
01:17:37,605 --> 01:17:41,483
Produced by injecting the virus
directly into living tissue.

595
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:44,153
The results were unstable.

596
01:17:44,862 --> 01:17:47,114
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA...

597
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:48,657
it will mutate...

598
01:17:56,165 --> 01:17:59,293
becoming a stronger,
faster hunter.

599
01:17:59,919 --> 01:18:00,836
Great.

600
01:18:02,129 --> 01:18:04,715
If you knew it was loose,
why didn't you warn us?

601
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,968
Because she was saving it.

602
01:18:08,469 --> 01:18:11,305
For us.
Isn't that right?

603
01:18:11,513 --> 01:18:14,642
I didn't think any of you
would make it this far.

604
01:18:14,975 --> 01:18:16,352
Not without infection.

605
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:19,855
Why didn't you tell us
about the antivirus?

606
01:18:20,356 --> 01:18:24,235
This long after infection,
there's no guarantee it would work.

607
01:18:26,153 --> 01:18:27,821
But there's a chance.

608
01:18:28,822 --> 01:18:29,823
Right?

609
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:32,159
I don't deal in chance.

610
01:18:40,209 --> 01:18:41,460
Fuck it.

611
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,557
No pressure, guys.

612
01:18:54,765 --> 01:18:57,726
You require
the four-digit access code.

613
01:18:57,893 --> 01:19:02,815
I can give you the code. But fírst,
you must do something for me.

614
01:19:03,023 --> 01:19:04,191
What do you want?

615
01:19:04,358 --> 01:19:09,238
One of your group is infected.
I require her life for the code.

616
01:19:09,446 --> 01:19:12,908
The antivirus is right there
on the platform!

617
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,787
I'm sorry,
but it's a risk I cannot take.

618
01:19:20,457 --> 01:19:22,835
She's right. It's the only way.

619
01:19:23,544 --> 01:19:25,421
You'll have to kill me.

620
01:19:28,757 --> 01:19:31,385
Otherwise,
we all die down here.

621
01:19:38,809 --> 01:19:42,229
The glass is reinforced,
but it won't hold forever.

622
01:19:46,901 --> 01:19:48,152
Do it.

623
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:50,446
- Get up.
- Just do it.

624
01:19:50,613 --> 01:19:52,156
- Please.
- Do it!

625
01:19:52,323 --> 01:19:53,949
You don't have long to decide.

626
01:19:54,116 --> 01:19:57,578
- You have no choice.
- Kill her now!

627
01:19:57,745 --> 01:19:59,914
- Get off!
- You don't have any choice.

628
01:20:00,414 --> 01:20:02,208
- Just do it now!
- I can't!

629
01:20:02,374 --> 01:20:04,543
- Kill her now. Do it.
- Please.

630
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:07,796
- Kill her. Kill her now!
- Just do it.

631
01:20:10,925 --> 01:20:11,926
Kill her!

632
01:20:39,411 --> 01:20:40,120
Kap?

633
01:20:42,164 --> 01:20:45,167
The bitch wouldn't open the door,
so I had to fry her.

634
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:48,546
Move!

635
01:20:56,929 --> 01:20:58,681
What the fuck was that?

636
01:20:58,973 --> 01:21:00,808
It's a long story.

637
01:21:20,286 --> 01:21:21,620
Start it up.

638
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,998
I'll get the virus.

639
01:22:00,701 --> 01:22:02,453
I'm missing you already.

640
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,627
We're in business.

641
01:22:10,878 --> 01:22:12,171
Full power!

642
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:13,672
We're leaving!

643
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:34,068
I don't want to be
one of those things...

644
01:22:36,862 --> 01:22:40,199
walking around without a soul.

645
01:22:41,242 --> 01:22:42,826
You won't.

646
01:22:43,911 --> 01:22:45,746
When the time comes...

647
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:48,999
you'll take care of it.

648
01:22:51,418 --> 01:22:53,504
No one else is going to die.

649
01:23:05,391 --> 01:23:06,433
Here.

650
01:23:16,652 --> 01:23:17,736
Rain.

651
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,407
Rain.

652
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:25,369
Rain.

653
01:24:10,456 --> 01:24:11,999
I'm not dead yet.

654
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,669
I think I'll have that back.

655
01:24:19,089 --> 01:24:21,258
I could kiss you, you bitch.

656
01:24:26,013 --> 01:24:27,515
What the hell's going
on back there?

657
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:43,197
- Get us the fuck out of here.
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails.

658
01:26:00,316 --> 01:26:02,109
Open the doors!

659
01:26:25,341 --> 01:26:28,260
Open the doors!
Now!

660
01:28:13,449 --> 01:28:15,784
I failed all of them.

661
01:28:18,746 --> 01:28:20,039
I failed.

662
01:28:21,874 --> 01:28:25,336
Listen to me. There is
nothing else you could've done.

663
01:28:26,212 --> 01:28:28,464
The Corporation's guilty here,
not you.

664
01:28:29,256 --> 01:28:31,175
And we finally have the proof.

665
01:28:31,634 --> 01:28:33,761
And that way,
Umbrella can't get...

666
01:28:34,762 --> 01:28:36,055
away with this.

667
01:28:37,515 --> 01:28:39,350
I mean, we can...

668
01:28:39,934 --> 01:28:41,101
What is it?

669
01:28:43,979 --> 01:28:47,733
You're infected, but you'll be okay.
I'm not losing you.

670
01:28:56,408 --> 01:28:59,537
- Help!
- Help him! What are you doing?

671
01:29:14,176 --> 01:29:15,469
He's mutating.

672
01:29:17,513 --> 01:29:19,598
I want him in the Nemesis Program.

673
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:25,187
Get off!

674
01:29:26,355 --> 01:29:27,648
What's happening?

675
01:29:53,382 --> 01:29:55,759
I want her quarantined.
Close observation...

676
01:29:55,926 --> 01:29:57,845
and a full series of blood tests.

677
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,849
Let's see if she's infected.

678
01:30:02,558 --> 01:30:04,852
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility.

679
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:09,315
Then assemble the team.
We're reopening the Hive.

680
01:30:10,691 --> 01:30:12,693
I want to know
what went on down there.

681
01:30:14,612 --> 01:30:16,030
Just do it

682
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:29,562
Who's in there?

683
01:31:32,064 --> 01:31:33,399
Let me out!

684
01:31:34,483 --> 01:31:35,860
Let me out!

685
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:38,863
Let me out!
