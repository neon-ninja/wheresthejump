1
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,492
Show yourself!

2
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,076
I know you're out there.

3
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,471
Help!

4
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,075
Help me!

5
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,345
Somebody help me!

6
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,948
Help!

7
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,774
Alas! Poor Yorick.

8
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,574
I knew him, Horatio.

9
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,586
A fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

10
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,287
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,

11
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,452
and now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is!

12
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,428
My gorge rises at it.

13
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,163
Here hung those lips...

14
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,214
Excuse me.

15
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,146
This is a private party, miss.

16
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,515
My name is Gwen Conliffe, and
I'm engaged to your brother, Ben.

17
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,852
Is Ben here?

18
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,724
No.

19
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,519
I'm afraid no one knows where Ben is,
which is why I'm here.

20
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,762
Clive.

21
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:06,473
Well, boys and girls,
let's repair to the tavern!

22
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,053
Good night, sweet prince.

23
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,615
I seem to recall,
Miss Conliffe...

24
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,402
I seem to recall he mentioned you
in one of his letters.

25
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,878
And it's quite uncharacteristic
of my brother

26
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,006
to treat a lady
in such a way,

27
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,246
but the character of man
is such a shiftable thing.

28
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,119
You misapprehend me.
Benjamin is missing from Blackmoor.

29
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,192
He's gone.

30
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,256
Did my father send you?

31
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,159
No, I'm here on my own.

32
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,629
It's been nearly a month
since anyone has seen Ben,

33
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,998
and we knew that
you were in London.

34
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,729
I'd hoped you had
received some word.

35
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,603
Why do you think
he's in trouble?

36
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,043
Because the night he went missing,
2 villagers were killed.

37
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,614
Would you help us?

38
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,478
Miss Conliffe,

39
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,622
I am under contract
for the next 30 performances.

40
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,690
If this is about your father,
I know how you feel.

41
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,662
Do you?

42
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,429
My company leaves
for America tomorrow.

43
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,602
I simply can't help.

44
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,470
He is your brother.

45
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,642
Good night.

46
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,713
It must be a wonderful luxury,

47
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,914
doing battle with imaginary demons,
Mr. Talbot.

48
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,220
Mine right now are very real.

49
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,383
Your mother?

50
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:05,991
Yes.

51
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,653
My oldest memories of my mother,

52
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,957
we are gathering grapes
in her father's vineyard.

53
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,726
It is my Garden of Eden.

54
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,301
You're paying yours a visit?

55
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,300
No, my mother died not long
after this was made.

56
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,508
My father and my brother,
they live near Blackmoor.

57
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,745
A man needs
a good stick on the moor.

58
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:42,418
I purchased this one
in Gévaudan lifetimes ago.

59
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,887
It's the work of
a master silversmith.

60
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,496
Would you do me the honor?

61
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,706
It's beautiful.

62
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,505
It will give me
great pleasure to know that

63
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,638
it was the keeping
of a civilized man.

64
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:08,347
Its heft is somewhat
too much for me these days.

65
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,223
You're overly kind.

66
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,392
But I'm afraid I must refuse it.

67
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,220
As you wish.

68
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:26,299
Hello?

69
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,211
Samson!

70
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:48,891
Lawrence?

71
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,332
Hello, Father.

72
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:57,429
Lo and behold,
the prodigal son returns.

73
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,869
I hope you're not expecting
the fatted calf.

74
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,134
Stay!

75
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,171
We don't have many visitors.

76
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,748
You seem well.

77
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:09,874
I've often wondered
what you look like.

78
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:15,322
You've come about
your brother, have you?

79
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:17,082
Stay.

80
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:18,851
Yes.

81
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:21,129
Miss Conliffe learned
that I was in London...

82
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:23,331
Samson.

83
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,558
...and sent me a letter

84
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,835
saying that Ben
has disappeared.

85
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:30,029
I thought I'd offer my help in
any which way I can.

86
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:34,074
Yes, what a splendid idea, Lawrence.
A splendid idea.

87
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,041
Too late, I'm afraid.

88
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,941
Unfortunately,
your brother's body

89
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:42,278
was found in a ditch by the priory road
yesterday morning.

90
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:45,209
I assume you have something
to wear for the funeral.

91
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,847
Sir John. You remember
my son, Lawrence?

92
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,285
Singh, my servant.

93
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,186
Master Lawrence.

94
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,927
It's nice to see you, Lawrence.

95
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,596
It's good that you're here.

96
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,225
Has Miss Conliffe been notified?

97
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,633
She's upstairs in her bedroom,
asleep.

98
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,408
Where are they
keeping Ben's body?

99
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:54,313
Your father instructed me to bury
your brother's effects with him.

100
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:56,448
It seems a shame.

101
00:12:58,293 --> 00:12:59,590
Thank you.

102
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,222
I wouldn't, sir. It's...

103
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,500
I missed his whole life.

104
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:45,498
What if it wasn't a beast at all,
but a cunning murderer?

105
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:48,498
Someone who bore a grudge
against one of these men.

106
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,545
To misdirect the authorities,
he kills the men,

107
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:53,136
and then he
tears up the bodies

108
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:55,375
to make it look like a wild beast
was responsible.

109
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:57,679
Ridiculous!
Who would go to such lengths?

110
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,277
What about that gypsy dancing bear?
It could have done it.

111
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:02,481
That mangy thing?

112
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:05,284
Kill 3 men?
I doubt it.

113
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,994
I saw the bodies
with my own eyes.

114
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:12,062
Unnatural wounds.
Most unnatural.

115
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,692
Made by a fell creature,
I say.

116
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:16,794
Damn gypsies wandering
the countryside,

117
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:19,135
bringing their woe and deviltry
with them.

118
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,074
They show up,
and 2 weeks later this happens!

119
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:25,112
My guess is Ben Talbot
went to their camp

120
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:27,181
to have it off
with a gypsy whore.

121
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,776
The bear gets
hold of him,

122
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:30,715
and they dump what's left of him
in the ditch!

123
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,514
Got nothing to do
with the gypsies.

124
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,931
25 years ago now,

125
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,201
me Pa found him.

126
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,908
Quinn Noddy
and all his flock.

127
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,108
Brains and guts
and God-knows-what

128
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,742
lying all over the moor
for a quarter mile.

129
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,452
And, Quinn,
the look on his face.

130
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,116
Like he'd been
eaten alive.

131
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,888
Whatever did it
was big, had claws,

132
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,091
and didn't mind
a load of buckshot.

133
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:09,205
After that, me Pa went home and
melted down me Ma's wedding spoons

134
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,473
and cast silver bullets
on them.

135
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:19,707
Wouldn't leave the house
on a full moon from then on.

136
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,758
He thought it was a werewolf.

137
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,599
I still say that bear's to blame.

138
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,568
You'd think the Talbots
would've learned their lesson?

139
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,769
Consorting with the Romas.

140
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,967
Right. Remember that
black-eyed Salome the old man married?

141
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,943
Went crazy up there
in the ward, killed herself.

142
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:50,344
She was a gypo whore queen
or some such, wasn't she?

143
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,416
Yes.

144
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,484
She was crazy

145
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,755
for coming to this
shithole you call a town.

146
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,356
What did he say?

147
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,388
You're in your drink, boy.

148
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,269
Get him out of my tavern, Nye!

149
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,273
Come on, lad.

150
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,671
If you want to do
something about it,

151
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,174
I'll be outside.

152
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,438
My mother wasn't a whore.

153
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,120
Lawrence Talbot?

154
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,501
Good evening.

155
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,474
Please join us.
It's good to see you up and about.

156
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:56,080
Refreshed, recovered
and as enchanting as ever.

157
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,013
Please, join us.

158
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,878
Good evening, Miss Conliffe.

159
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,012
Good evening.

160
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,815
What a pleasant surprise.

161
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,588
May I recommend the baked eel?

162
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,391
Singh has outdone himself this evening,
haven't you, Singh?

163
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,767
Something plainer.

164
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:21,861
Thank you.

165
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,439
I was a moment ago
telling my son

166
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,913
that the telegraph system does
reach us here in lonely old Blackmoor.

167
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,281
Do you find your home
much changed, Mr. Talbot?

168
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,959
Blackmoor does seem
rather the same as I left it.

169
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,593
How so?

170
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,929
The villagers,
they still have the same wild ideas.

171
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:52,094
Yes, well, they're a provincial lot,
I must say,

172
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,907
ignorant and superstitious
to a worldly man such as yourself.

173
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,806
We're savages
at the ends of the earth.

174
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,613
I didn't intend
to start a squabble.

175
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:08,510
All I'm saying is that you dismiss
the natural man at your peril.

176
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,587
That's all.

177
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,851
I find your insecurities
quite strange, Father.

178
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,585
No, you mistake that
for my self-awareness.

179
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,697
And how comfortable
are you in your skin, may I ask?

180
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,061
One can get
used to anything.

181
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,157
Excuse me.

182
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,149
You know, Lawrence, I've never
understood what it is that you do,

183
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,417
pretending to be
other people.

184
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,991
But I understand you're highly
celebrated and famous for it.

185
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,321
Perhaps one day I'll see for myself
what all the fuss is about.

186
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,491
I think your mother
would've liked that.

187
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,228
She loved you and your brother
with all her heart.

188
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,200
Why did she do it?

189
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,641
She struggled with life,
as we all do.

190
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,547
She lost.

191
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,743
Does that answer your question?

192
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,578
I saw Ben's body today.

193
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,588
What kind of animal
could have done such a thing?

194
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:21,015
I've seen the work of a Kodiak bear
and a Bengal tiger,

195
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,727
nature at its most vicious,

196
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,454
but I must say, I've never seen
anything like this.

197
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,825
People in town say
it was a man.

198
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,367
You mean a raving lunatic
at loose on the moor?

199
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,906
Yes, it's possible, but I think I would
have run him down with my dogs.

200
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,039
On the other hand,

201
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,413
the wounds are so terrible
that only something human

202
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,419
would seem capable
of such wanton malevolence.

203
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,023
I found a strange medallion
among Ben's belongings.

204
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:58,121
Yes, Saint Columbanus.
He was an Eastern saint.

205
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,260
He was also a gypsy.

206
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,728
So did Ben have dealings
with the gypsies?

207
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,607
Yes, he was our negotiator.

208
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,938
The local gentry would pay a fee,

209
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,741
and the gypsies would keep
their criminal activities to a minimum.

210
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:23,111
And they would move on once
they'd sold the local lads all the wine

211
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,951
and dark-haired ladies
they could stand.

212
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:38,459
"That orbèd maiden with white fire laden,
Whom mortals call the moon,

213
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,937
"Glides glimmering o'er
my fleece-like floor..."

214
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:46,009
"By the midnight
breezes strewn."

215
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,348
She exerts enormous power,
doesn't she?

216
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,047
I wish things were different.

217
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,092
Never look back, Lawrence.
Never look back.

218
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,829
The past is
a wilderness of horrors.

219
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:16,264
Lawrence,
I'm glad you're home.

220
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,455
Can I help you, sir?

221
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,585
I was hoping to have a word
with Miss Conliffe.

222
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,658
Just a moment, sir.

223
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,348
Miss Conliffe.

224
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,875
My behavior was unacceptable.

225
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,813
These were Ben's.

226
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,382
He'd want you to have them.

227
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,696
If there's anything you need,
anything at all, please let me know.

228
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,163
I want to know
what happened to him.

229
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,211
I'll do everything I can.

230
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,776
Thank you.

231
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,747
Thank you for coming.

232
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,379
Mother!

233
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,451
Mother!

234
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:46,439
Lawrence.

235
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:51,674
Lawrence.

236
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,580
Lawrence, wake up.

237
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:02,750
I heard something.

238
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,091
Lawrence.

239
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:16,528
Lawrence, I'm scared.

240
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,162
Go back to bed.

241
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:13,987
Mother?

242
00:25:16,164 --> 00:25:17,324
Mother!

243
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:05,712
Hello.
Hello.

244
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:15,752
Ben said that you played here
as children.

245
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:17,751
It was our refuge.

246
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:20,224
From what?

247
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:22,590
You mean from whom.

248
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,092
Your father,

249
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,498
he has a way
with being distant.

250
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:33,331
Ben told me it was because I
reminded him of your mother.

251
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,576
He said you did,
as well.

252
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:41,311
Which is why he put me in an asylum
for a whole year,

253
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,283
then shipped me off
to my aunt in America.

254
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,783
You sure you won't
stay one more night?

255
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:52,484
My father has
lodgings at the inn,

256
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,427
and that's more convenient
for the train, so...

257
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,191
When do you
return to London?

258
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:02,496
Not till I find out
what happened to my brother.

259
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:18,217
Lawrence, that's all
well and good,

260
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,288
but I think your inquiry
could wait until tomorrow.

261
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:26,326
The moon is full tonight,
and I'd prefer that you stay inside

262
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,220
in the event that your raving lunatic
theory is correct.

263
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:33,295
I don't want
to lose you, too.

264
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:05,061
Take your horse, sir?

265
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:08,624
Good evening.

266
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:15,042
He says you must stay in the camp.
The woods are not safe.

267
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:18,010
Ask him if he knows anyone
who sells these.

268
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,281
You want to talk to Maleva.

269
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:22,349
To who?
Maleva.

270
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:30,589
It was found on
my brother's body.

271
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:35,827
Your caravan shows up,
3 men are killed.

272
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,928
I don't think it's a coincidence.

273
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,967
There is no coincidence.

274
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,033
Only fate.

275
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,099
But she plays a hidden hand.

276
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,009
Tell me about my brother.

277
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:09,526
Run round the back!

278
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:26,540
Give us the bloody bear,
you old snake handler.

279
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:27,876
We know what's
been going on.

280
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:30,212
Nonsense.
He dances, that's all.

281
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:32,886
Come on! Get off!
What's going on here?

282
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:34,249
We've come
for the bear, Nye.

283
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,481
It done all the killing.

284
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,753
For goodness' sake!
He's harmless.

285
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:02,883
What happened?

286
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,679
It's the Devil!
The Devil!

287
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:43,082
Mama! Mama!

288
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:44,419
Maria!

289
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:47,024
Maria! Where are you, Maria?

290
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:49,989
Maria!

291
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:55,059
Over there!

292
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:56,158
Maria!

293
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,269
Maria!

294
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:09,975
Mama!

295
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:11,843
Mama!
My baby.

296
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,818
Take the girl.
Stay in the camp.

297
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:44,909
Boy!

298
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:48,077
Boy!

299
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:42,493
Go back, get help!

300
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:45,064
Get Maleva!

301
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:58,377
Once he is bitten by the beast,
there is no cure.

302
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,818
You should let him die.

303
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:02,650
You would make me a sinner.

304
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:05,590
There is no sin
in killing a beast.

305
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:07,526
Is there not?

306
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:21,203
Sometimes the way of fate
is a cruel one.

307
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:25,004
He can only be released
by someone who loves him.

308
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,073
Lawrence.

309
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:00,941
Holy Mother of God.

310
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,883
Help me with him, Singh.

311
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:06,955
"Do thou but thine
and be not diffident of wisdom

312
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:09,964
"She deserts thee not
if thou dismiss not her"

313
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:00,112
Is everything all right?

314
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,474
Lawrence?

315
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,149
Get Dr. Lloyd.

316
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,746
Are you all right?

317
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,749
Yes, I feel better.

318
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:48,588
I thought you were leaving.

319
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:53,664
Well, this place is
impossible to escape.

320
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:58,640
Besides, it's the least
I could do.

321
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:13,883
What did the gypsies say?

322
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,118
Some nonsense about the Devil
being at Blackmoor.

323
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:18,888
It's remarkable.

324
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:21,653
A week ago, I would have said
you'd never use that arm again.

325
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:22,959
And now?

326
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,730
It seems to have
healed itself.

327
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:31,004
I'll be back to check on you
at the end of the week.

328
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,267
Thank you, Doctor.

329
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:34,807
Miss Conliffe.
Yes?

330
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:36,436
I want to thank you.

331
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:37,513
For?

332
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:41,846
For prolonging your stay here at Blackmoor
with us during this difficult time.

333
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:45,778
Had there been some sense
of filial obedience,

334
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:49,491
well, you would not have been
inconvenienced.

335
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:52,660
Well, Lawrence was trying to
find out what happened to Ben.

336
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,024
And now we know
it's still out there.

337
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:01,401
Nevertheless, I thank you.

338
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,069
Not at all.

339
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:59,057
You should be asleep, Lawrence.

340
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:00,629
So should you.

341
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,731
Is there anything
I can get for you?

342
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,303
Are you expecting a war?

343
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:13,536
A Sikh is a warrior of God.
He must always arm himself against evil.

344
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,070
Do you believe in curses?

345
00:40:18,898 --> 00:40:22,334
This house has seen more than
its share of suffering.

346
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:28,032
Your mother. Your brother.
Yes, I believe in curses.

347
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:31,309
How could you stand it here
all these years?

348
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:34,146
You didn't have
to stay.

349
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,146
Silver.

350
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,951
I didn't know
you hunted monsters.

351
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:48,186
Sometimes monsters
hunt you.

352
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,324
Yes, he's been quite seriously
injured, Inspector,

353
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:25,795
and he's suffering
from a loss of memory.

354
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:27,559
I don't think he could be
of any use to you now.

355
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:28,929
Well, I think, at some point,

356
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:30,730
he is going to want to
talk about...

357
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:31,963
No. I do understand.

358
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:34,335
Only if I could have
just a few words with him.

359
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,964
No. A completely
unofficial interview.

360
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:39,841
Even the briefest exchange
could be infinitely helpful to me.

361
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:49,334
Francis Aberline,
Scotland Yard.

362
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:52,703
Honored to meet you, Mr. Talbot.
I'm a huge admirer.

363
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:54,841
I'm sorry to hear
of your troubles.

364
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,276
I do hope they won't
impede your return to the stage.

365
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,007
Thank you.

366
00:42:00,415 --> 00:42:01,905
Shall we?
Please.

367
00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:15,491
It was an animal.

368
00:42:16,732 --> 00:42:18,461
You're quite sure?

369
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:23,136
What else could it have been?

370
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,076
There are other witnesses, no doubt,
that had a better look than I did.

371
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:31,746
Well...

372
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:34,879
Not too good a look,
I'm afraid.

373
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:37,918
None of the locals
survived to tell of it,

374
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:42,114
and the gypsies only talk of
demons and devils.

375
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,496
I understood your injury
was quite savage.

376
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:50,754
Yes.

377
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:52,458
I hope you don't
find this prurient,

378
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,091
but would it be
possible for me

379
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:57,069
to arrange for a specialist
to examine you?

380
00:42:57,472 --> 00:43:01,408
It's amazing what we can discern
by scientific means these days.

381
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:04,740
And at your convenience,
of course.

382
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:05,972
Of course.

383
00:43:07,966 --> 00:43:09,900
No, a great mystery,
it is,

384
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,834
given that there are no natural
predators left in England

385
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:17,135
capable of inflicting
such horrific injuries.

386
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:21,842
Well, the savagery of the attack would
suggest the action of an animal.

387
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,045
Or a lunatic, perhaps.

388
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:29,251
Someone with a history
of mental disturbance,

389
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:31,652
who'd spent time
inside an asylum

390
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:36,823
and who may have suffered injuries
at the hands of his victims.

391
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:39,463
I get
your implication

392
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:41,192
and resent it.

393
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,296
You're clearly aware
of my personal history,

394
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:47,564
as I believe
I am aware of yours.

395
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,176
Weren't you in charge of the
Ripper case a couple of years back?

396
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:57,072
Well, you're a direct man,
so I'll be equally direct with you.

397
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:59,615
I'm not your enemy,
Mr. Talbot.

398
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:04,248
But you've been seen as Hamlet,
Macbeth, Richard III,

399
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:06,414
all with that same face.

400
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:11,392
Now a prudent man would ask who else
might be living inside that head of yours.

401
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:15,360
Good day, Inspector.

402
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:23,937
So you won't mind
if I establish your whereabouts

403
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:26,067
on the nights in question?

404
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:27,808
Feel free.

405
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,743
Good day, Mr. Talbot.

406
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:33,507
I'll be sending my specialists
to examine you

407
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:35,643
at your convenience,
of course.

408
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:01,169
Lawrence?

409
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:05,114
Yeah. You all right?

410
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,217
Yes.

411
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,615
What did the Inspector say?

412
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,154
Well, he asked a lot of questions.

413
00:45:11,923 --> 00:45:15,950
I'm sorry. I feel so responsible
for what's happened to you.

414
00:45:17,595 --> 00:45:19,460
If I hadn't sent that letter,
you'd be back in New York.

415
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:22,965
No. No. It was right
that I came back.

416
00:45:24,636 --> 00:45:25,898
You mustn't feel like that.

417
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:37,503
No.

418
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:39,316
Try it.

419
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:42,809
Well, I can't make it skip
like you.

420
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,122
You have to flick it.

421
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,695
May I?
Yes.

422
00:45:55,733 --> 00:46:00,693
When you throw it,
turn your wrist up and whip it.

423
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:04,834
Wrist up and whip it.

424
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:08,844
And make sure
you swing your hips.

425
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:25,694
What's it like in New York?

426
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:38,902
Did you hear that?

427
00:46:39,444 --> 00:46:40,604
What?

428
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:43,614
Horses.

429
00:46:56,094 --> 00:46:59,222
Hello, Doctor. I thought our appointment
wasn't till Friday.

430
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:03,897
Come with us. It's nearly the full moon.
You were bitten by the beast.

431
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,764
You bear his mark now.

432
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,360
Mr. Talbot.

433
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:12,402
There are many of us here who are
looking for a natural explanation.

434
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:13,833
Help us.

435
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:16,436
Come on, Talbot.
Show us your wound.

436
00:47:16,748 --> 00:47:18,443
We are told it heals
in an unnatural way.

437
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,209
Get your hands
off of me.

438
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:25,380
Will you let him murder
your wives and children?

439
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:32,524
My eyes!
Damn you, Talbot!

440
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:35,991
Sorry, Colonel.
I meant to shoot you.

441
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:40,869
Sadly, I'm not the marksman I used to be.
I must be getting old.

442
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:43,372
He's cursed. God
has forsaken him.

443
00:47:43,775 --> 00:47:45,538
Let us deal with him.

444
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,201
You know you're
trespassing on my land,

445
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:49,040
and I could shoot you
on the spot right now.

446
00:47:49,147 --> 00:47:50,910
My Sikh manservant,
he's on the roof,

447
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:54,075
and he happens to be a crack shot
with a repeating rifle.

448
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:55,948
And he will kill you.

449
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,748
He'll kill the next 8 of you
before he has to reload,

450
00:47:58,856 --> 00:48:01,381
so please take yourself
off my land.

451
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,651
And if I see any of you
trespassing this way again,

452
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:07,595
I won't be so civil,
if you take my meaning.

453
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:10,601
Good day to you, Colonel.

454
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:12,797
Lawrence.

455
00:48:20,912 --> 00:48:22,470
You're bleeding.

456
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:37,719
How could they possibly think
he's a threat to them?

457
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:41,994
Well, he's a stranger here in Blackmoor,
Miss Conliffe,

458
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,000
and that makes him
very dangerous.

459
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:48,462
Thank you.

460
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:53,033
Yes. You can also thank Singh
when he returns from the village.

461
00:48:53,945 --> 00:48:56,436
You're not the only one
in the family who can act.

462
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:01,911
Samson!

463
00:49:07,658 --> 00:49:10,092
Let's get something
to clean that.

464
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:20,660
Did they hurt
your shoulder?

465
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:22,928
No.

466
00:49:23,908 --> 00:49:27,173
On the contrary,
it feels much stronger than before.

467
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:29,173
That's good.

468
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,048
I was able to hold them...

469
00:49:33,117 --> 00:49:34,880
All 3 of them back.

470
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,424
You know, you mustn't listen to them.
The villagers.

471
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:47,690
They're backward
and foolish.

472
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,501
Everything I hate
about this place.

473
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:13,083
This might sting a bit.

474
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:20,625
Lawrence.

475
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:32,239
Excuse me.

476
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:17,280
What's happened?
You have to leave.

477
00:51:18,022 --> 00:51:19,319
Please pack your things.

478
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:21,855
Did I do something?

479
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:24,221
It's not safe here.

480
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:27,295
You must return
to London tonight.

481
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:29,198
I'll be out here waiting.

482
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:32,698
Lawrence, wait.

483
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:39,875
What are you afraid of?

484
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:45,043
If anything
ever happened to you,

485
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,945
I'd never forgive myself.

486
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:30,426
There are those who doubt
the power of Satan.

487
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:35,960
The power of Satan
to change men into beasts!

488
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:40,199
But the ancient pagans
did not doubt.

489
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:44,764
Nor did the prophets.
Did not Daniel warn Nebuchadnezzar?

490
00:52:45,276 --> 00:52:47,938
But the proud king
did not heed Daniel.

491
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:54,315
And so, as the Bible says, "He was made
as unto a wolf and cast out from men."

492
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:56,915
A beast has come among us.

493
00:52:57,822 --> 00:52:59,653
But God will defend
his faithful.

494
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,322
With his right hand,
he will smite the foul demon.

495
00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:08,089
I say to you, the enemy's ploy
is a devious one.

496
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:13,063
Twisting the accursed into beasts,
he seeks to bring us low.

497
00:53:13,637 --> 00:53:15,332
Make us as animals.

498
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:17,470
Teach us self-loathing,

499
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:21,341
so we forget that we are made in
the image of Almighty God himself!

500
00:53:22,546 --> 00:53:23,706
Samson.

501
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:28,112
Why does our Lord
tolerate this mockery?

502
00:53:31,856 --> 00:53:34,154
"Pride goeth
before destruction,

503
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:37,191
"a haughty spirit
before the fall."

504
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:40,260
I say it is because
we have sinned against him.

505
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:45,230
Because our crimes reek to heaven,
and they demand vengeance.

506
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:13,961
Pint of bitter, please.

507
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:19,949
Mrs. Kirk.

508
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:24,050
Why aren't you out with MacQueen,
trying to catch that thing

509
00:54:24,157 --> 00:54:25,590
what killed my husband?

510
00:54:26,893 --> 00:54:29,020
As I don't know where
the lunatic will strike,

511
00:54:29,129 --> 00:54:32,155
it seems the practical thing to do
is to stay as near as possible

512
00:54:32,265 --> 00:54:33,254
to the potential victims.

513
00:54:35,535 --> 00:54:40,268
And seeing that 214 of the 309 residents
of Blackmoor and its environs

514
00:54:40,574 --> 00:54:42,974
live within, what,
500 yards of this tavern,

515
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:46,074
I was planning
to spend the evening here.

516
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,372
Not Talbot Hall?

517
00:54:48,982 --> 00:54:50,210
Why would you say that?

518
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:52,785
They're cursed, all of them.

519
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:57,513
Unfortunately, "cursed"
does not give me a warrant

520
00:54:57,624 --> 00:55:00,491
to wander about
Sir John's estate at night.

521
00:55:02,129 --> 00:55:04,222
Rules, Mrs. Kirk.

522
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:09,128
They're all that keep us from
a dog-eat-dog world, you know.

523
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:14,030
Pint of bitter, please.

524
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:43,436
Lawrence,

525
00:55:45,672 --> 00:55:48,140
Miss Conliffe has left Blackmoor.

526
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:51,073
Yes, I sent her away.

527
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:54,180
She's probably
in London by now.

528
00:55:54,714 --> 00:55:56,807
Why would you
do that, Lawrence?

529
00:55:58,852 --> 00:56:01,047
Because this place is cursed.

530
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:46,265
Father.

531
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:42,456
It is a shrine
to your beloved mother.

532
00:59:42,558 --> 00:59:44,856
She was truly
a beautiful woman.

533
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:51,530
I know that losing her
wounded you deeply.

534
00:59:51,634 --> 00:59:56,003
And it is monstrous,
a young boy seeing his mother like that.

535
00:59:56,539 --> 00:59:58,564
And I would have
given my life, Lawrence,

536
00:59:58,674 --> 01:00:01,234
that you hadn't
found us that night.

537
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:04,269
You must believe me
when I tell you this, Lawrence.

538
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,473
You do believe me,
don't you?

539
01:00:06,582 --> 01:00:10,450
I loved your mother with a passion
like the burning of the sun.

540
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:13,415
Her death finished me.
I was devastated.

541
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:15,915
I still prowl the house
at night,

542
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:19,658
searching for her.

543
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:23,522
I'm dead all the same.

544
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,427
Look into my eyes, Lawrence.

545
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,236
You see, I'm quite dead.

546
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,138
My dear fellow,
I wish I could tell you

547
01:00:39,248 --> 01:00:43,412
that the tragedy that has
beset your life was over.

548
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:48,889
But I'm afraid the darkest hours
of hell lie before you.

549
01:00:53,796 --> 01:00:55,559
I don't think they'll
kill you, Lawrence,

550
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:57,662
but they will blame you.

551
01:00:59,468 --> 01:01:01,595
The beast will have its day.

552
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:04,934
The beast will out.

553
01:02:44,655 --> 01:02:46,953
We've got him, men!
We got him!

554
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:49,682
Mind the pit, Johnny!

555
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,891
Johnny?
Help me get out!

556
01:02:54,999 --> 01:02:56,591
Shoot it! Shoot him!

557
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:05,509
Johnny!

558
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:15,045
Johnny?

559
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:27,491
MacQueen!

560
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:27,032
Lawrence.

561
01:05:28,573 --> 01:05:29,801
Lawrence.

562
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:33,272
Lawrence!

563
01:05:37,616 --> 01:05:38,810
Wake up.

564
01:05:40,585 --> 01:05:41,813
Lawrence.

565
01:05:52,898 --> 01:05:54,889
Terrible things, Lawrence.

566
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:58,797
You've done terrible things.

567
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:18,518
Hold your fire!
We want him alive!

568
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,428
Get down!
On your knees!

569
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:31,826
Tis as you said, Inspector.

570
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:33,961
It is as you said.

571
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:36,036
I'm sorry, Sir John.

572
01:06:39,678 --> 01:06:41,543
Be strong, Lawrence.

573
01:06:43,115 --> 01:06:44,742
Be strong.

574
01:06:51,189 --> 01:06:52,656
Where is my father?

575
01:06:56,394 --> 01:07:00,490
I am sorry to see you
back here with us, Lawrence.

576
01:07:03,034 --> 01:07:04,831
You disappoint me.

577
01:07:06,171 --> 01:07:09,038
But we have made
enormous strides

578
01:07:09,141 --> 01:07:12,702
in the treatment
of delusions such as yours.

579
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:14,643
Where is my father?

580
01:07:51,716 --> 01:07:52,876
Bracing, is it, guv'ner?

581
01:07:58,223 --> 01:07:59,952
Where's my father?

582
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:03,720
Where's my father?

583
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:19,275
I said if you don't kill my father,
he will kill again and again

584
01:08:19,377 --> 01:08:20,969
and again and again.

585
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:26,675
"Prithee, Horatio,
tell me one thing.

586
01:08:26,785 --> 01:08:29,185
"Dost thou think Alexander
looked o' this fashion i' the earth?

587
01:08:29,287 --> 01:08:31,414
"And smelt so?
And smelt so?"

588
01:08:31,523 --> 01:08:34,549
I hope this won't impede
your return to the stage.

589
01:08:34,659 --> 01:08:36,524
Alas, poor Yorick!

590
01:08:37,362 --> 01:08:39,057
Lawrence, wake up.

591
01:08:39,364 --> 01:08:40,524
I heard something.

592
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,101
Terrible things, Lawrence.

593
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:48,168
Terrible things.

594
01:08:50,976 --> 01:08:52,170
Father!

595
01:08:58,817 --> 01:09:01,786
Look into my eyes, Lawrence.
You see, I'm quite dead.

596
01:09:04,356 --> 01:09:05,687
It's all right, Lawrence.

597
01:09:06,057 --> 01:09:09,424
Everything's all right.
I'm going to take you home.

598
01:09:10,195 --> 01:09:11,662
Come with me.

599
01:09:12,497 --> 01:09:14,465
It's all right.
Come on.

600
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:18,627
It's all right.

601
01:09:19,304 --> 01:09:20,771
Hold me.

602
01:09:23,074 --> 01:09:24,837
Just hold me.

603
01:09:31,783 --> 01:09:33,410
It's not real.

604
01:09:35,987 --> 01:09:37,215
It's not real.

605
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:49,129
Lycanthropy.

606
01:09:49,234 --> 01:09:51,464
Yeah, lycanthropy.

607
01:09:55,373 --> 01:10:00,140
I contracted the disease, if that's
what it is, in India in the Hindu Kush.

608
01:10:00,545 --> 01:10:04,345
The natives directed me to a cave
high up in the mountains,

609
01:10:04,449 --> 01:10:09,079
where, according to legend, lived a
strange creature. A very strange creature.

610
01:10:09,187 --> 01:10:13,920
And after a great many days
of climbing and searching,

611
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:17,886
finally, I came
upon it. I found it.

612
01:10:17,996 --> 01:10:23,525
I found the cave, and the strange
creature that lived there.

613
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,538
It was a little boy,

614
01:10:27,639 --> 01:10:31,268
a little wild feral boy,
powerfully strong,

615
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,246
who suddenly
attacked me and bit me.

616
01:10:43,755 --> 01:10:47,555
So I returned to my hunting companions
in the valley below

617
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:49,650
thinking I'd been
made the butt of a joke.

618
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,725
I soon discovered otherwise.

619
01:11:02,474 --> 01:11:04,101
You killed my mother.

620
01:11:07,562 --> 01:11:09,189
Yeah, I suppose I did.

621
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,467
You should kill yourself.

622
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:17,299
I cannot tell you how often
I've considered that.

623
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:19,168
But life is far too glorious,
Lawrence,

624
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:21,834
especially to the cursed
and the damned

625
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:23,370
like myself.

626
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:25,840
Yeah.

627
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,541
Every night of the full moon,

628
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:32,711
for many years,
I've been locked away in that crypt

629
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,346
by Singh,
my faithful servant.

630
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:38,055
25 years.

631
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:44,562
Then she came, didn't she?
Hot and burning like the face of the moon.

632
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,425
Gwen?

633
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:48,196
Yeah, she would have taken
your brother away from me,

634
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:51,602
and they would have both
vanished into the night forever.

635
01:11:51,706 --> 01:11:54,504
And although I was resigned to it,
the beast in me was not.

636
01:11:54,609 --> 01:11:57,134
And, Ben, you understand,
had come to tell me

637
01:11:57,245 --> 01:12:00,908
that he was quite resolute in his decision
to leave Talbot Hall for good

638
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:03,211
and to take Gwen
away from me.

639
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:06,981
I became drunk and violent,
and extremely violent.

640
01:12:07,088 --> 01:12:09,852
And I struck out at Singh,
who was trying to restrain me,

641
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:12,253
and I knocked him out cold.

642
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,260
Poor...
Poor old Singh.

643
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:16,264
Yeah.

644
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:17,992
You know, I never
told you this, Lawrence,

645
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:20,260
but I used to be
a bare-knuckle prize fighter

646
01:12:20,368 --> 01:12:23,565
when I was a young man
in the ports of Boston,

647
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,401
San Francisco, New York.

648
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,237
Back in the good old days,
before you were born.

649
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,335
Long time ago.

650
01:12:31,379 --> 01:12:32,505
Bam!

651
01:12:33,214 --> 01:12:34,340
Yeah.

652
01:12:34,449 --> 01:12:39,011
Anyway, as a consequence, I was unable
to lock myself in the crypt that night.

653
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,214
And I found your brother's body
in a ditch

654
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,451
not far from the house.

655
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:46,686
He'd been torn to pieces.

656
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:52,461
I know now it was a mistake
to lock up the beast.

657
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:56,132
Don't you think so, Lawrence?

658
01:12:57,238 --> 01:12:58,899
I should have let it run free.

659
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:00,973
Kill or be killed.

660
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:03,303
I'll kill you!

661
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:10,341
You have a long way to go
yet, my young pup.

662
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,147
I'll kill you.

663
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:13,584
Your chance is coming

664
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:16,017
soon enough.

665
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,685
She'll be full tonight,

666
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:21,821
the moon.

667
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:24,825
I have a small gift
for you, Lawrence,

668
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,400
in the event
you don't find life

669
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,435
as glorious as
I find it to be.

670
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,528
Or not to be.

671
01:13:35,794 --> 01:13:38,854
I'm deeply sorry about this, Lawrence.
I do love you, dear boy.

672
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:41,262
You may find that
hard to believe,

673
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,190
in the light
of what has happened.

674
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:44,359
I'll kill you.

675
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:46,096
Sleep now.
I'll kill you.

676
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:47,671
Rest.

677
01:13:47,772 --> 01:13:49,672
Guard?
I'll kill you!

678
01:13:53,478 --> 01:13:55,446
I'll kill you!

679
01:14:10,629 --> 01:14:12,927
I attempted to remove
these mental fabrications,

680
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:18,867
but now, 25 years later, I find that
young Lawrence's harmless hallucinations

681
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:24,499
have manifested themselves
into delusions of a horrific nature.

682
01:14:28,546 --> 01:14:29,706
Mr. Talbot.

683
01:14:30,181 --> 01:14:33,309
We are here tonight
to illustrate conclusively

684
01:14:33,418 --> 01:14:37,013
that Mr. Talbot's fears
are quite irrational.

685
01:14:37,455 --> 01:14:41,448
So we will remain
in this room together,

686
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:44,551
and once Mr. Talbot
has witnessed

687
01:14:44,663 --> 01:14:48,599
that the full moon
holds no sway over him,

688
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:53,535
that he remains a perfectly
ordinary human being,

689
01:14:53,638 --> 01:14:56,471
he will have taken
his first small step

690
01:14:56,574 --> 01:15:00,271
down the long road
to mental recovery.

691
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:04,481
Now, we are all aware
that Mr. Talbot

692
01:15:04,582 --> 01:15:09,246
has suffered quite traumatic
personal experiences.

693
01:15:09,988 --> 01:15:13,617
He witnessed his mother's
self-mutilations.

694
01:15:14,059 --> 01:15:19,292
His young mind, unable to accept it,
created a fantastical truth,

695
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:22,827
that his father is to blame.

696
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:27,002
That his father is literally

697
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,604
a monster.

698
01:15:31,343 --> 01:15:36,474
But your father
is not a werewolf.

699
01:15:37,716 --> 01:15:40,446
You were not bitten
by a werewolf.

700
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,747
You will not become
a werewolf

701
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:49,553
any more than I will sprout wings
and fly out of that window.

702
01:15:52,497 --> 01:15:54,556
Please, please, help me.

703
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:59,665
I think that Mr. Talbot
has something to say to us.

704
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:11,379
Stop it.

705
01:16:12,017 --> 01:16:14,508
Speak up, Mr. Talbot.

706
01:16:14,986 --> 01:16:17,477
Forgive me,
but we can't hear you.

707
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:20,888
You moron.

708
01:16:21,693 --> 01:16:24,662
Tonight, I will kill
all of you!

709
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:28,329
I will kill
all of you!

710
01:16:29,134 --> 01:16:33,434
Yes, well, as you
can see, lycanthropy

711
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:37,634
Please do something about it!
is a disease of the mind

712
01:16:37,742 --> 01:16:41,041
existing somewhere
in the deep recesses Kill me.

713
01:16:41,146 --> 01:16:44,115
Kill me!
of Mr. Talbot's thoughts.

714
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:47,507
To him, it seems very real.

715
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:51,984
The subject before you has,
for the past month,

716
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:57,585
undergone both pharmaceutical
and physical desensitizing

717
01:16:57,695 --> 01:17:01,062
in order to reduce
the nervous exaggerations.

718
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:22,579
Dr. Hoenegger?
This malady derives from...

719
01:17:29,894 --> 01:17:31,657
Doctor!

720
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:41,762
Let me pass!

721
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:00,257
For God's sake, hurry up!

722
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:17,970
Open...
Open this door!

723
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:19,304
It seems to be
locked, sir.

724
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:27,108
Idiot! Open it!

725
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:36,526
Smash open this door!

726
01:18:37,695 --> 01:18:38,992
Help me!

727
01:19:34,052 --> 01:19:35,781
Davis?
Yes, sir?

728
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:37,047
Are you armed?
Yes, sir.

729
01:19:37,155 --> 01:19:39,055
Give me your revolver!
Quickly!

730
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,744
Pardon me. Excuse me.

731
01:20:10,755 --> 01:20:12,222
As you were.

732
01:20:25,169 --> 01:20:26,466
Carter!
Sir.

733
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:27,731
Have you got a pistol?
Yes, sir.

734
01:20:27,839 --> 01:20:28,828
Follow me.

735
01:20:29,073 --> 01:20:30,802
Telegraph the Yard.
Issue weapons.

736
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:32,102
All right, sir.
Now!

737
01:20:32,343 --> 01:20:33,367
Right away, sir!

738
01:20:37,315 --> 01:20:39,647
I don't suppose
we have any silver bullets.

739
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,911
What?

740
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:06,970
Clear the street!

741
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:18,944
My God!

742
01:21:24,762 --> 01:21:25,854
You two, with me.

743
01:21:40,078 --> 01:21:41,204
Steady.

744
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:01,122
God help us.

745
01:22:59,524 --> 01:23:00,855
Up ahead!

746
01:23:01,926 --> 01:23:03,450
Start checking the docks!

747
01:23:59,016 --> 01:24:00,483
Who's there?

748
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:04,219
Lawrence?

749
01:24:04,922 --> 01:24:06,048
What are you doing here?

750
01:24:11,162 --> 01:24:13,027
What have they done
to you?

751
01:24:15,733 --> 01:24:17,860
I am what they say I am.

752
01:24:18,936 --> 01:24:20,563
I'm a monster.

753
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:24,270
And so is my father.

754
01:24:26,344 --> 01:24:27,868
He killed Ben.

755
01:24:30,882 --> 01:24:32,679
And my mother, too.

756
01:24:52,537 --> 01:24:54,232
I can help you.

757
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:57,373
There's no help for me.

758
01:24:58,509 --> 01:25:01,808
If such things exist,

759
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:05,774
if they are possible,

760
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:07,783
then everything is.

761
01:25:08,986 --> 01:25:10,283
Magic.

762
01:25:11,489 --> 01:25:12,786
And God.

763
01:25:16,127 --> 01:25:19,096
I can find a way to stop it.

764
01:25:24,535 --> 01:25:26,799
I must confess,

765
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:30,670
I envy my brother
for the days he had with you.

766
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:35,008
What joy
he must have felt.

767
01:25:36,781 --> 01:25:39,409
I would have given
anything I own

768
01:25:40,151 --> 01:25:42,619
to have known you
in another life.

769
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,715
I must get back to Talbot Hall
and end this.

770
01:25:54,565 --> 01:25:55,862
Lawrence.

771
01:25:57,969 --> 01:25:59,994
Please let me help you.

772
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:02,468
You already have.

773
01:26:07,111 --> 01:26:09,602
Lawrence, don't.
Just stay here with me.

774
01:26:10,314 --> 01:26:12,145
Stay here with me!

775
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:54,590
Miss Conliffe,
good morning.

776
01:26:54,692 --> 01:26:56,091
Inspector.

777
01:26:56,193 --> 01:26:57,922
May I impose?

778
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:13,533
I must ask you directly,
have you seen Lawrence Talbot?

779
01:27:14,445 --> 01:27:16,106
I'm sure by now
you've heard of his escape.

780
01:27:16,213 --> 01:27:18,272
Yes, I've heard.
And, no, I haven't seen him.

781
01:27:20,367 --> 01:27:24,861
Miss Conliffe, I cannot stress to you
enough the mortal peril you're in

782
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,407
should you find yourself
in his presence.

783
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:36,075
Thank you.
I'll be careful.

784
01:27:38,118 --> 01:27:42,817
Miss Conliffe, I admire your
noble intentions.

785
01:27:42,923 --> 01:27:46,586
You think you can save him,
but you can't.

786
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:48,457
I must insist
you come with me.

787
01:27:48,562 --> 01:27:49,859
Insist? He's not...
Carter!

788
01:27:49,963 --> 01:27:51,931
He's not here, Inspector!

789
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:53,294
Take your hand off me.

790
01:27:53,934 --> 01:27:56,027
Come on!
Take your hand off me!

791
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:57,962
Come on now, woman!

792
01:28:04,645 --> 01:28:06,203
Talbot?

793
01:28:06,313 --> 01:28:08,873
Raise your arms and step out
where I can see you.

794
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,145
Talbot?

795
01:28:12,653 --> 01:28:14,712
No!
Come now! Come along!

796
01:28:21,128 --> 01:28:22,823
Now there's some
bad luck for you.

797
01:28:25,799 --> 01:28:30,202
Globe! Globe!
Lawrence Talbot is still missing!

798
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,571
Police scour London!

799
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,869
Globe! Globe!

800
01:28:37,244 --> 01:28:40,839
Lawrence Talbot
is still missing!

801
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:43,311
Police scour London!

802
01:28:45,285 --> 01:28:47,480
Lawrence Talbot
is still missing!

803
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:50,721
Police scour London!

804
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:27,481
I'm looking for a woman called Maleva.
Do you know her?

805
01:31:27,147 --> 01:31:28,512
Thank you.

806
01:31:41,261 --> 01:31:43,456
What is it you want from me?

807
01:31:54,474 --> 01:31:55,498
Lawrence Talbot.

808
01:31:58,195 --> 01:32:00,686
You know what happened to him.
You understand it.

809
01:32:00,797 --> 01:32:02,389
Listen to me.

810
01:32:02,899 --> 01:32:04,867
I need you to help me.

811
01:32:06,236 --> 01:32:08,170
Leave him to his fate.

812
01:32:08,271 --> 01:32:10,034
I have to save him.

813
01:32:12,242 --> 01:32:13,869
Do you love him?

814
01:32:16,646 --> 01:32:17,908
Just tell me what to do.

815
01:32:19,616 --> 01:32:21,550
Will you condemn him?

816
01:32:22,219 --> 01:32:23,743
Or will you

817
01:32:25,822 --> 01:32:27,346
set him free?

818
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:31,120
Do you know
what that means?

819
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:34,927
Yes.

820
01:32:35,632 --> 01:32:39,227
But I can't. I can't do that.
He's still there.

821
01:32:39,336 --> 01:32:41,964
I know he is.
I know I can save him.

822
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:46,305
I'm begging you,
tell me what to do.

823
01:32:48,178 --> 01:32:49,805
There is no cure.

824
01:32:53,383 --> 01:32:55,476
You are risking your life.

825
01:32:58,855 --> 01:33:02,916
May the saints protect you and give
you strength to do what you must.

826
01:33:10,233 --> 01:33:11,467
There!

827
01:33:27,384 --> 01:33:28,942
You're sure he'll come?

828
01:33:29,753 --> 01:33:31,414
Yeah, quite sure.

829
01:33:33,757 --> 01:33:35,054
Right.

830
01:33:36,293 --> 01:33:38,124
Take the priory road.

831
01:33:38,562 --> 01:33:40,189
Railway station.

832
01:33:40,797 --> 01:33:42,389
South garden to the river.

833
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:44,531
Tell Sir John
we're here,

834
01:33:44,634 --> 01:33:46,568
and then stay
close to the estate,

835
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:47,762
but not too close.

836
01:33:48,538 --> 01:33:50,506
If you see Talbot,

837
01:33:51,575 --> 01:33:53,440
don't get caught
in a conversation.

838
01:33:54,478 --> 01:33:55,570
Shoot him

839
01:33:55,712 --> 01:33:56,679
and kill him.

840
01:33:57,914 --> 01:33:59,245
On sight!

841
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:16,751
Carter hasn't reported.

842
01:35:18,195 --> 01:35:20,163
He's not at his post
in front of the house.

843
01:35:23,767 --> 01:35:25,098
Miss Conliffe?

844
01:35:25,202 --> 01:35:26,260
Wait!

845
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:28,528
Get the others.

846
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,547
Samson.

847
01:39:55,755 --> 01:39:58,315
"I will arise and
go to my father,

848
01:39:58,424 --> 01:40:02,520
"and I will say unto him, 'Father, I have
sinned against heaven and before thee.

849
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:05,597
"'I am no more worthy
to be called thy son."'

850
01:40:13,422 --> 01:40:16,914
And lo and behold, there he stands.
The prodigal son.

851
01:40:17,726 --> 01:40:19,660
For he is returned.

852
01:40:24,566 --> 01:40:27,865
Shall I have my own robe brought
to be placed upon your shoulders?

853
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:30,962
Rings for your fingers?
Shoes for your feet?

854
01:40:31,073 --> 01:40:32,631
What you should do is pray,

855
01:40:32,941 --> 01:40:35,171
but we both know
it wouldn't do any good.

856
01:40:37,879 --> 01:40:41,110
Are those Singh's silver bullets
in my gun?

857
01:40:41,216 --> 01:40:42,615
I'm sorry.

858
01:40:43,185 --> 01:40:45,483
You have me
at a disadvantage.

859
01:40:47,456 --> 01:40:49,048
It makes me happy.

860
01:40:49,157 --> 01:40:50,624
What does?

861
01:40:52,127 --> 01:40:54,186
Seeing you here like this.

862
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:56,698
My son returned.

863
01:40:58,133 --> 01:40:59,566
It is glorious, isn't it?

864
01:41:00,302 --> 01:41:02,532
No. It's hell.

865
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:04,905
Hell?

866
01:41:05,007 --> 01:41:08,909
No. The beast is the beast.

867
01:41:09,978 --> 01:41:11,639
Let it run free.

868
01:41:22,591 --> 01:41:24,525
Poor little Lawrence.

869
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:27,285
You were the fragile one.

870
01:41:27,896 --> 01:41:32,128
I removed the powder from those
shells many, many years ago.

871
01:41:32,234 --> 01:41:34,600
But I confess,

872
01:41:34,703 --> 01:41:38,537
I was quite overwhelmed
by your enormous courage.

873
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,974
Finally, you're the man
I always wanted you to be.

874
01:41:43,945 --> 01:41:45,913
Lawrence! My boy.

875
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:09,396
Here.

876
01:42:10,405 --> 01:42:11,531
Do you see her, Lawrence?

877
01:42:11,973 --> 01:42:13,668
Do you feel her presence?
Her power?

878
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:17,141
She'll be here soon.

879
01:42:17,646 --> 01:42:20,114
Coming from
darkness into light.

880
01:42:25,287 --> 01:42:27,278
You're heir to
my kingdom, Lawrence.

881
01:42:27,389 --> 01:42:29,289
You've always been heir
to my kingdom.

882
01:45:19,594 --> 01:45:20,754
No!

883
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:30,731
Run! Run!

884
01:46:50,952 --> 01:46:52,317
Are you sure
you're all right, sir?

885
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:53,819
Go on.

886
01:48:00,321 --> 01:48:02,289
Look at me, Lawrence.
You know me.

887
01:48:03,725 --> 01:48:05,317
You know who I am.

888
01:48:06,461 --> 01:48:07,485
Don't.

889
01:48:07,595 --> 01:48:08,857
You know who I am!

890
01:48:10,598 --> 01:48:12,691
Lawrence! Don't.

891
01:48:14,169 --> 01:48:15,602
Look at me.

892
01:48:16,204 --> 01:48:17,728
Lawrence, you know me.

893
01:48:18,039 --> 01:48:20,166
You know me,
remember me, look at me.

894
01:48:27,849 --> 01:48:29,214
It's Gwen.

895
01:48:30,518 --> 01:48:33,453
Lawrence, it's Gwen. Please.

896
01:49:38,019 --> 01:49:39,111
No!

897
01:50:28,903 --> 01:50:30,131
Gwen...

898
01:50:30,772 --> 01:50:32,399
I'm sorry.

899
01:50:34,242 --> 01:50:36,369
It had to be this way.

900
01:50:38,913 --> 01:50:40,540
I'm sorry.

901
01:50:44,786 --> 01:50:46,413
Thank you.

902
01:51:41,509 --> 01:51:45,240
It is said there is no sin
in killing a beast,

903
01:51:46,547 --> 01:51:48,742
only in killing a man.

904
01:51:53,521 --> 01:51:56,922
But where does one begin
and the other end?
