2
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,819
Little bitch!

3
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,322
Give me that bag. Oopsy-daisy.

4
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:18,988
Ow!

5
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,242
- Knock it off! Get off, Kenny!
- What do we got here? I'm gonna take that.

6
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,743
- Get off him!
- What the fuck?

7
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,373
- You're such a stupid fuck!
- What'd you just call me?

8
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,707
I called you a stupid
fuck, you stupid fuck.

9
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,126
Hey, don't touch her!

10
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,878
Hey, I don't need your help, okay?

11
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,175
That's all you're gonna do? Out
here by yourself, teach me a lesson?

12
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,513
You got held back, didn't
you, Kenny? Twice, I think.

13
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,557
You think that's funny?

14
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,393
No, I think it's very sad, actually.

15
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,562
I only mention it because
that would make you over 18.

16
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,482
If you were to beat me up, which I'm
sure you could, it would be child abuse.

17
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,530
So if you don't want to wind up on some
registry, I suggest you back the fuck...

18
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,678
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

19
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,680
I'm looking at homework here for
at least 15 different students.

20
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,058
Are we really not gonna discuss
that I have an ice pack on my face?

21
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,059
Nurse says you'll be fine.

22
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,771
So no interest in why a teacher
found me sprawled out on the ground?

23
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,523
Mia Sutton says she saw you
walk into a beam out back.

24
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,068
How do you think we found you?

25
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,113
All right. I get it. I'm in
trouble. All I'm trying to say is,

26
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,074
you have the chance to stop the people
who make things hard for everybody.

27
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,868
You gotta see the big picture here.

28
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,955
Light...

29
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,581
some people might look at
you, a kid in your situation,

30
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,583
losing your mom the way you did,

31
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,916
and they'd cut you a little slack when
it comes to these behavioral issues.

32
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,258
Well, I don't believe in that.

33
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,804
Detention. Two weeks. Get out of here.

34
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,444
Hey.

35
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,876
Oh! Hi. I'm awake.

36
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,629
I was just like a tree
or a plant or something.

37
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,385
I'm heading out for a moment. Don't
fall asleep or it adds another day.

38
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:10,785
"Rule one: The human whose name
is written in this note shall die."

39
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,787
Whoa.

40
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,914
"Rule two: This note
will not take effect

41
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,292
unless the writer has the
person's face in their mind

42
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,587
when writing his or her name."

43
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,114
Ah!

44
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,463
Hello?

45
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,724
Help! Help me! Help! Help!

46
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,235
Holy shit! Holy shit!

47
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,240
What the fuck?!

48
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,467
Shall we begin?

49
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,437
Okay.

50
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,187
Relax, Light.

51
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,731
You're asleep.

52
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:49,152
You're asleep and you're
dreaming of some eight-foot-tall,

53
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,571
demon-looking motherfucker.

54
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,574
Oh, yes.

55
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,577
A dream. I like that.

56
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,705
Dreams are places you
can have fun, right?

57
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,625
It's all in your mind,
so why not enjoy it?

58
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,171
Shh.

59
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:08,838
Listen.

60
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,008
Get off of me!

61
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,722
Go, check it out.

62
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,977
- No!
- Come on! Come on!

63
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,020
What?

64
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,314
Kenny, no! Let me go! Get off me!

65
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,777
You're so disgusting!
Get the fuck off of me!

66
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,779
- Ooh! While you're down there...
- Aw, it sucks to be you.

67
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,449
Now we could, in this dream of yours,

68
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,121
take care of a situation like this.

69
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,500
We just put Kenny's name down...

70
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,919
and see what happens.

71
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,758
Yeah.

72
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,805
- Nah.
- Get off! You're such assholes!

73
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,934
I know you want to.

74
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,436
Go on.

75
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,730
Help her.

76
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,941
I don't have a pen.

77
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,071
It's a good thing you have a pen.

78
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,789
Ah...

79
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,797
Good. Now as long as we're
playing, let's do it right.

80
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,716
There's no need to stop at "who."

81
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,802
I'm sorry. What else is there?

82
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,222
How.

83
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,188
For a beginner, not bad at all.

84
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:49,190
Now...

85
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,650
watch.

86
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,323
Give it back!

87
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,603
Ah!

88
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,028
Now listen. I need to separate
the wheat from the chaff.

89
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,196
I think you might be
capable of great things,

90
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,949
but if you don't think you
can handle it, that's fine.

91
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,576
Just put the note somewhere,

92
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,538
leave it alone for seven days,
and I'll find it a new home.

93
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,998
How can this be possible?

94
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,709
It happened. Just like that.

95
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,755
And if this is possible,
imagine what else you could do.

96
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,175
- He a friend of yours?
- Who?

97
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,927
Kid in the accident.

98
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,472
Oh. No, I don't think he
was a friend of anyone.

99
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,266
Want to talk about it?

100
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:50,864
No.

101
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,225
We should talk about why
you were still at school.

102
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:54,939
Oh, yeah, that wasn't a big deal.

103
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,194
I just wrote a couple papers
and then got detention.

104
00:12:57,197 --> 00:13:00,639
You don't think cheating's
a big deal? That who you are?

105
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,865
No, um...

106
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,494
Actually, I only got caught because
I was trying to break up a...

107
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,123
Know what? Doesn't matter.
You wouldn't understand anyway.

108
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,709
Because you're just that
smart or I'm just that dumb?

109
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,795
Because this is what you do. Instead
of trying to solve real problems,

110
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,840
you look over people's shoulders
so you can bust them for bullshit,

111
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,175
like not turning in
their reports or whatever.

112
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,304
A gun is only good as its aim, son.

113
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,433
I make sure people can trust our aim.

114
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,854
Just once, it would be nice
to think that you actually...

115
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,939
I mean, you're a cop.
How do you sleep at night

116
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,859
knowing you watched while a guy
like Antony Skomal walked away?

117
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,235
You think I just watched?

118
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,863
If I was a cop and some
guy ran over my wife,

119
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,574
I'd be pretty pissed off if his
dad paid his way out of jail.

120
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,577
He killed my mom, he nearly
beat his girlfriend to death,

121
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,204
and you just sit there
saying the same bullshit

122
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,583
- about how people better trust your aim...
- I'm gonna assume you're still raw

123
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,251
by what you saw today at school,

124
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,587
and that's keeping you from
thinking before you speak.

125
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,591
I suggest you stop talking.

126
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:32,497
"Rule 64: Each page of the note
contains the power of the whole note."

127
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,915
"Rule 95: Anyone may
write names in the note,

128
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,502
but only the keeper can possess it
for more than seven days." Jesus!

129
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,005
How many rules does it take to...

130
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,758
"Don't trust Ryuk.

131
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,718
He is not your pet.
He is not your friend."

132
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,155
- Hey, kid.
- Ah!

133
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,117
It's pronounced Ree-yook.

134
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,201
Ryuk.

135
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,164
Oh. Hi.

136
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,583
Sorry for the mispronunciation.

137
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,289
Ryuk, what exactly can I
do with this Death Note?

138
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:04,211
What exactly did you have in mind?

139
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,047
Well, it says that I can
specify the manner of death.

140
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,509
If I can choose how they die, does
that mean I can actually control them?

141
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,763
Every human spends the last moments of
his life in the shadow of a death god.

142
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,434
If we so desire, we can
influence those moments.

143
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,480
There are, of course, limitations.

144
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,521
"Rule 20:

145
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:27,320
A subject can be influenced for no more
than two days leading up to his death."

146
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,070
Two days? Your fingers are huge.

147
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,479
"Rule 28: Each death must
be physically possible,"

148
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:36,494
so no shark attacks while
someone's on the toilet.

149
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,540
As much as I love that idea.

150
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,665
Uh, where did it come from?

151
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,169
The history of the note is
as long as history itself.

152
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,588
But who gave it to me? I
mean, did you give it to me?

153
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:52,053
The last keeper of the note passed
away. It fell to me to find a new one.

154
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,179
- What if I didn't want it?
- You may pass it on.

155
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,517
Or better yet, I will.

156
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,100
- How would you do that?
- I told you!

157
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,646
When the note is separated
from the keeper for seven days,

158
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,564
I find a new one.

159
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,691
Who wrote those warnings
about you in the margins?

160
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,279
Oh, is that what we're gonna do with
the note, Light? Rules and warnings?

161
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,319
_

162
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,253
The name and the face
is all you have to have.

163
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,257
Turner.

164
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,927
Yeah, no, it's fine. What's going on?

165
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,597
Say that again.

166
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,016
You gotta be kidding me.

167
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,065
All right, yeah. I'll see you in a bit.

168
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:10,650
All right.

169
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:14,276
Hey.

170
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,905
Hey, uh, one second.

171
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:17,531
Come in.

172
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,119
Hey, what you up to?

173
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
Uh, just fell asleep on my desk.

174
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,166
I just got a call.

175
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,503
Our friend Antony Skomal is no more.

176
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,338
Impaled himself on a steak knife
in the middle of a restaurant.

177
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,715
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

178
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,841
You seem happy.

179
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,012
Probably shouldn't be, but yeah, I am.

180
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,517
Your mom...

181
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,521
she always was kind of a hippy.

182
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,356
And we didn't see eye
to eye on everything.

183
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,942
She was damn sure right about one thing.

184
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,487
Karma's a bitch.

185
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,785
Sorry about what I said... you know.

186
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,247
Love you, son.

187
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,958
I love you, too.

188
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,329
- Go, go!
- Yeah! Watch your feet!

189
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,000
You in mourning?

190
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,919
In... Uh, what?

191
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,545
Our friend Kenny.

192
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,924
Oh, yeah. It's terrible
what happened to Kenny.

193
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,095
You don't have to lie to
me. Kenny was a sociopath,

194
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,347
and just because he's dead
does not make it a tragedy.

195
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,226
- Right.
- I just wish I'd seen it.

196
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,284
I heard his head spun
all the way around.

197
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,813
Actually, his head exploded
into a million pieces.

198
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,899
- In case you're wondering.
- You saw it?

199
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,901
Mm-hmm.

200
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,536
- I'm Mia.
- Oh, hi.

201
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,996
I know that you're Mia,
actually. I already knew that.

202
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,457
I know that you're Light
Turner. I already knew that.

203
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,750
Yeah.

204
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,211
You knew that I'm... You know my name?

205
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,546
So are you gonna tell me
what you saw, Light Turner?

206
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,425
Why did you get me put into detention?

207
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,469
I'm sorry.

208
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,429
I, uh... thought you could
use some medical attention

209
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,848
and I wasn't aware of the fact
that you were carrying around

210
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,394
a stockpile of illegal
papers in your backpack.

211
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,895
Is that one of them?

212
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,022
Hmm? Oh, no.

213
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,233
"Death Note"? What is it?

214
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,403
- What is what?
- Your book.

215
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,241
Uh, I can't tell you.

216
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,245
- Okay.
- Do you really want to know?

217
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,208
- Sure.
- Okay, then I'll tell you. I just...

218
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,961
Follow me.

219
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,264
Please tell me this
isn't your poetry journal.

220
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,186
When you see him, try not to
freak out. I freaked out a little.

221
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,688
See... who?

222
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,791
Behind you.

223
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,821
It's okay.

224
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,862
What are you talking about?

225
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,861
Only the keeper of the note can see me.

226
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:52,371
"The human whose name is written
in this note... shall die."

227
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,247
- Your poetry sucks.
- It's not poetry.

228
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,710
Um, will you just read the last entry?

229
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,590
"Kenny Doyle decapitation"?

230
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,635
I have, and...

231
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,804
I'm gonna sound crazy,
but I have a death god.

232
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,480
- I'm gonna get out of here.
- No. No, don't go. Trust me.

233
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,776
You of all people are
gonna want to see this.

234
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,654
Authorities received a 911 call...

235
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,989
Okay, we can work with that.

236
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:33,744
Overheard a violent argument between
Mr. Brode and his ex-wife earlier today.

237
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,245
Things escalated,

238
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,458
as several gunshots were also heard,
and the situation is still unfolding.

239
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,126
Authorities are standing by.

240
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,088
Seattle police and Seattle SWAT
trying to de-escalate the situation.

241
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,008
This is live coverage
of the hostage situation.

242
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,927
- Okay. Watch.
- Police are now confirming the hostages

243
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,640
- are Brode's ex-wife and children.
- Hope you know what you're doing.

244
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,517
With his violent history,
police are hesitant

245
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,895
about moving in on this situation.

246
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,767
You stupid bitch! You fucking stay
there, you snot-nose little douchebag!

247
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,991
It appears that James Brode
is exiting the storefront.

248
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:17,704
It looks like he has released her.

249
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,625
That's definitely a good sign.

250
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,718
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my goodness.

251
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,223
Uh, folks, we are trying
to get more information.

252
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,266
I hope no children were watching this.

253
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,103
This is obviously
very upsetting footage.

254
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:45,607
In case you're just tuning in,
the man holding his family hostage

255
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,820
just saluted to cameras before
being run over by a rogue SWAT truck.

256
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,614
We apologize for these
disturbing images...

257
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,902
I killed him.

258
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,840
I guess I should feel
guilty, but I don't.

259
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,761
That woman and her kids are only alive
right now because of what you did.

260
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,723
What is there to feel guilty about?

261
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,141
Thing is, I know what it's
like to get fucked over.

262
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,437
Some asshole killed my mom and...

263
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,856
got away with it until I got this book.

264
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,608
I just keep thinking, I mean,
why should it just be for me?

265
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,446
I mean, all the people that make
life miserable, make life dangerous...

266
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,824
I can reach them now.

267
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,036
Do you think that I'm crazy?

268
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,709
If anything, I think
you're not crazy enough.

269
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,300
- We could change the world.
- "We"?

270
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,138
Like "we" as... as in us?

271
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,111
We're getting an update live...

272
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,864
The police are extremely hesitant...

273
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,091
Can I kiss you?

274
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,095
You're not supposed to ask.

275
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,390
What am I supposed to do?

276
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,163
The note was filled
with names when I got it.

277
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,500
Whoever had it before us,
what did they accomplish?

278
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,920
Just small-time killings,
revenge, petty crimes?

279
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,966
I think we can do a lot more than
just settle some random scores.

280
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,093
How about this guy?

281
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,848
I don't want people to say
they're scared of it or horrified.

282
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,250
What do you want them to say?

283
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,397
I want them to say... "Thank you."

284
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,613
Look at those people.

285
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,324
- They're a bunch of sheep.
- No, they're not.

286
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,660
They're looking for someone
who's not gonna let them down

287
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,203
the way cops do and politicians.

288
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,788
And that's why they have you.

289
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,834
It's bigger than me.
It's bigger than us.

290
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,586
What they want...

291
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:52,963
is a god.

292
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:55,422
So let's give it to them.

293
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:59,009
Let's give them a god,
let's make a name for him.

294
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,219
A god that never lets anybody down.

295
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,639
It's not gonna solve a few
crimes, it's gonna solve all crime.

296
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,850
A god that scares the
shit out of the bad guys

297
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,727
until they don't want to be bad anymore?

298
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,024
A god who inspires hope that
things can actually change.

299
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,066
Kira.

300
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,943
Kira? What does that mean?

301
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,862
It means "light" in Russian and Celtic.

302
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,406
Wouldn't you be worried they
could trace it back to you?

303
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,657
No. How could they?

304
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,535
It also sort of means
"killer" in Japanese,

305
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,165
so if they're looking, it's
gonna be on the wrong continent.

306
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,585
Who or what is Kira?

307
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,613
That's the question facing
baffled investigators today

308
00:28:36,616 --> 00:28:41,099
as death row inmates in six different
continents were found dead in their cells.

309
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:45,430
Each victim left behind the same
message written in perfect Japanese.

310
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,475
It reads, "Lord Kira has
returned to punish the wicked."

311
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,480
None of the victims
actually spoke Japanese...

312
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,147
I think I got one.

313
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,359
Reports are that the
previously elusive leader

314
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,820
of the terrorist movement blew
himself up in front of his men.

315
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,159
Kira is apparently
behind the bizarre deaths.

316
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,704
Five members of the cartel
apparently threw themselves

317
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,082
in front of an oncoming train.

318
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,335
Kira is responsible
for all of these acts

319
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,087
that are happening right now.

320
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,964
The globalists will have you believe

321
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,467
that Kira's the New World Messiah
here to right the wrongs of our time.

322
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,928
This is another bid by the super
elites to sweep the rug from under us

323
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,764
and shape our reality by
what can only be described

324
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,519
as one of the greatest false flag
operations in the history of covert ops.

325
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,479
Fear they will be punished by Kira

326
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:39,818
has led to a series of wanted criminals
literally turning themselves in.

327
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,197
Kira's had a bigger impact on
crime than anything I've seen.

328
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,994
I don't wanna say our job's
gotten easier, but look around you.

329
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,129
News out of Japan tonight

330
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,465
where Kira has apparently struck again.

331
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,677
More than a dozen were found
dead in a Tokyo nightclub,

332
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,139
a scene authorities described
as "incredibly gruesome."

333
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,599
What can anyone tell us about Kira?

334
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,186
And perhaps, more importantly,
can anyone stop it?

335
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,690
And should they?

336
00:30:16,737 --> 00:30:19,072
_

337
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,959
It makes no sense.

338
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,421
The Nakamuras and the Inagawas
have had a truce for over ten years.

339
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,548
How would Kira even know about them?

340
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,759
- Because I tipped him off.
- What?

341
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,345
I've had access to law enforcement
databases for some time.

342
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,680
I've been seeding the
names of obscure criminals,

343
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,434
waiting for a hit.

344
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,730
And now... we know
who we're looking for.

345
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,965
How long since you've slept?

346
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,717
Forty-one hours.

347
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,137
And you're certain of your conclusions?

348
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,806
Yes.

349
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:37,143
The insulin spike from the candies will
focus your mind for final consideration.

350
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,439
When it fades, you
will sleep for one hour.

351
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,236
Wear these to properly
prepare your body clock.

352
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,490
I've been contemplating
several different strategies.

353
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,575
I honestly don't know
that I'll be able to sleep.

354
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,747
- Sleep is key to strong thought.
- Yes.

355
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,667
Would you mind singing a song for me?

356
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,670
Of course.

357
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,964

358

365
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,511
Investigation, since when? And why
are you just telling me this now?

366
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,055
Because I just got added last week.

367
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,765
Knowing you'd have this sort
of calm and thoughtful response,

368
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,435
I can't imagine why I
didn't bring it up sooner.

369
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,103
What part of terrorists
killing each other

370
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,185
and criminals turning
themselves in bothers you, Dad?

371
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,983
Why exactly are they doing that, son?

372
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,194
- They're doing it because of Kira.
- Right, and who is that?

373
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:14,073
How does Kira get to decide who lives
and dies, who's guilty and innocent?

374
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,118
Is there a complaints department if
I don't like one of Kira's decisions?

375
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,412
Or would complaining get
me put on Kira's list?

376
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,247
Is that what everybody
at the station thinks?

377
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,003
Well, it's safe to say I'm
ahead of the curve on that one.

378
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,088
Hey, how do I look?

379
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,842
- Good.
- All right. See you this afternoon.

380
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:52,736
_

381
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,538
- Turner.
- Just got a call from the FBI.

382
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,873
Apparently, they got someone
who wants to speak with you.

383
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,751
- Oh, yeah? And who is that?
- They're not really saying.

384
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,503
Just said he helped them out before

385
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,797
and he's got a theory
on the Kira situation.

386
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,466
- I just got the case. What does he want?
- I have no idea.

387
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,051
They said he's a little different.

388
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,262
In fact, they'll probably
send a representative...

389
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,264
Detective Turner?

390
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,598
I am to meet with Detective Turner,

391
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,854
local head of the Kira investigation,
in his office at 9:00 a.m.

392
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,623
Call you back.

393
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,152
- What can I do for you?
- I am Watari.

394
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:36,154
Your fellow officers did that?

395
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,033
Cops don't like it when
you go after other cops,

396
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,661
but, apparently, they hate it
when you go after their god.

397
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,829
They support Kira?

398
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,831
Kira's doing away with
the "Most Wanted" list.

399
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,291
These guys wanna throw him a parade.

400
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:50,378
But now that rumor has it
Kira's a cop, it's in my world.

401
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,258
The idea that Kira is associated
with law enforcement is not a rumor.

402
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,884
It is a fact,

403
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,512
uncovered by the individual I work with.

404
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,599
- Oh, yeah, and who's that?
- He goes by the letter "L."

405
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,600
L is real?

406
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,351
You're familiar?

407
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,521
Yeah, I hear things.

408
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,981
That giant smuggling
ring in Eastern Europe,

409
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,733
practically handed to
police on a platter.

410
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:15,111
L would like to speak with you
regarding the Kira investigation.

411
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,324
- Okay. When?
- Right now.

412
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,958
- Hmm, Detective Turner.
- What is this?

413
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,378
A one-time offer.

414
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,379
I'd like to assist you
in the capture of Kira.

415
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,258
Why me? The FBI, CIA have
hundreds of men on this.

416
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,844
I've been in communication
with Interpol and the FBI,

417
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,680
but I believe you have
something they do not.

418
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,682
What's that?

419
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,934
An in-depth understanding
of potential suspects.

420
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,561
Why would I have a better understanding?

421
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,564
The FBI thinks the killer
is operating out of Japan.

422
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,107
Because of the name Kira.

423
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,611
Ah, but the name is an
intentional misdirection.

424
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,325
He wants us to believe that he's
Japanese, operating a half a world away.

425
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,202
He's not.

426
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,330
Kira's in Seattle.

427
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,084
Shall we help one another?

428
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,766
"Justice for the Wicked." What is this?

429
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,644
It's a site for Kira worshipers.

430
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,813
They put up names of
people that deserve to die.

431
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:32,855
Holy shit.

432
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,440
Rapists, pedophiles,

433
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,693
human trafficking, murder.

434
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,655
This guy killed four
people in a house fire.

435
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,583
I don't know. How do
we know that it's real?

436
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:42,593
What do you mean?

437
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:46,183
What if somebody fucked your girlfriend
and you put him on the list to kill him?

438
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,249
What would you do if some guy fucked me?

439
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,126
- Oh, I'd kill him.
- Yeah?

440
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,446
- Yeah.
- You'd kill him?

441
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,628
- Yeah.
- You'd kill him?

442
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,967
But that is the reason why we can't
kill people based on website rumors.

443
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,468
It's not like that.

444
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,432
These are real people with real
problems, and they've been ignored.

445
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,685
They need our help.

446
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,147
Figured you'd be older.

447
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,066
And that I'd be able to
see more of your face.

448
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:02,487
Yes, well, I find I'm not in a
very trusting mood these days.

449
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,823
I took the liberty of moving your
evidence to a more secure location.

450
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,912
Oh, I can see that. Were
you gonna let me know or...?

451
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,915
Wow, this is very, very impressive,
James. Your men must be proud.

452
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,169
Ask your partner how my men
think about me these days.

453
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,880
So you did all of this yourself?

454
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,966
Even more impressive.

455
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,637
Please, James, have a
seat. Rest your glutes.

456
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,434
Mm-mmm. You've made two mistakes.

457
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,437
This is zero day, Kira's
first recorded murders.

458
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,149
But previously, on April 15th,
convicted felon James W. Brode

459
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,777
had taken his wife and children hostage.

460
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,279
I remember that. You
think that was Kira?

461
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,824
Initial speculation was that
his behavior was drug-related,

462
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,451
but lost in the ensuing
crush of Kira activities

463
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,621
was the fact that Brode's
toxicology had come back clean.

464
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,581
The stand-off had never
made national news,

465
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,209
and it was only broadcast
on local Seattle stations.

466
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,212
- So that's how you knew he was here.
- I infiltrated your network

467
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,714
in order to ensure that there
hadn't been a data breach.

468
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,467
Prior to my access,
the network was intact.

469
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,151
Did you just hand me evidence
you hacked the Seattle P.D.?

470
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:11,848
I handed you evidence
that whoever Kira is,

471
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,559
they have access to the
database from the inside.

472
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,645
Kira's one of ours.

473
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:19,272
Here's a cross-reference list
of officers and their access

474
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,858
as well as the dates of Kira activities.

475
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,069
The Federal Administration has agreed
to make resources available to us.

476
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,321
We can begin seeing who was where when.

477
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,368
- What are you gonna do?
- I'd like to start by speaking with Kira.

478
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,704
Sure you are.

479
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,062
- Hey.
- Light, turn on the news.

480
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,190
The individual known as Kira,

481
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,527
as I'm sure you're aware, has
taken credit for over 400 deaths.

482
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,778
Oh, shit.

483
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,281
While we don't know how
he kills his victims,

484
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,074
we do know how he chooses them.

485
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,367
Prior to these deaths,

486
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,623
all of the victims have had their
identities released to the media.

487
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,293
This would suggest that Kira
is not some omnipotent force.

488
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,670
He's a person...

489
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,756
like you or me.

490
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,674
He is also a coward.

491
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,800
A child wielding power
he does not understand,

492
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,763
mistakenly believing in doing
so, he's at no risk to himself.

493
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,805
He's wrong.

494
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,604
Kira, if you're watching this,
know that I am coming for you.

495
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:44,607
Unless, of course, you'd
like to kill me right now.

496
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,699
Now I'm rooting for this guy.

497
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,119
Would you shut the fuck up?

498
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:56,996
No?

499
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,374
Well, in that case, Kira,

500
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,710
I shall be meeting you
face-to-face very shortly.

501
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,337
Who does this guy think he is?

502
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,763
What the fuck was that?

503
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,806
I have a theory.

504
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,560
Kira cannot kill by simply sight alone.

505
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,687
He needs a name and a face.

506
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,231
Every victim we've seen
so far fits this pattern.

507
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,149
So you antagonize him on purpose?

508
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,610
While withholding my
identity from the record.

509
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,572
Now, we know that he wants
to kill me but is unable.

510
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,909
And what if you're wrong?

511
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,329
Then, James, I'd be dead.

512
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,916
Either way, we'll have
gained valuable information.

513
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,752
He always pull this kind of stuff?

514
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,695
You guys getting close to catching Kira?

515
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:15,627
Oh, I'd say the haystack's down
to a hay pile. Still a lot of hay.

516
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,161
I saw the press conference today.

517
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,204
Who's that guy on TV
with the turtleneck?

518
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,376
You like that look? I'm
thinking of taking it myself.

519
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,419
Hmm.

520
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,672
Goes by L. He's an
independent investigator.

521
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,883
Wow, so you don't even
know his real name.

522
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,428
About the only thing I know is
he's got some handler named Watari.

523
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,929
Really likes ice cream.

524
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,223
He's connected an awful lot of dots.

525
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,603
Do you think he's connected
the dots because he's Kira?

526
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,063
I don't think so.

527
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,273
He has a history of cracking big cases.

528
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:53,194
Besides, I think you can tell when you're
sitting across from a killer like Kira.

529
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,737
Right. Of course.

530
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,947
What happens when they catch Kira?

531
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,825
Well... he's murdered over 400 people,

532
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,244
so, my guess...

533
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,247
it's probably gonna be a fight
between those who want to hang him

534
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,711
and those who want to dissect
him and figure out how he did it.

535
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,840
- You okay?
- Yeah.

536
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,691
You put someone on my kid?

537
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,736
We agreed that everyone with access
needed to be thoroughly vetted.

538
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,239
I did not see it prudent to
have you investigate yourself.

539
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,866
What? We're not talking
about investigating me.

540
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,701
We're talking about
having my son followed!

541
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,079
I investigated you prior
to offering my assistance

542
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,705
and concluded you are not Kira.

543
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,125
As for your son, he may
have access to databases

544
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,835
around which we have
centered our search.

545
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:54,755
Therefore, deserves the same scrutiny
as anyone else that fits that criteria.

546
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,176
- No, he's a kid!
- Yes.

547
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,469
- A particularly bright kid.
- You know what?

548
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,641
If you had any questions about
my son, you should've come to me.

549
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,852
Here you go.

550
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,691
Even if they're suspicious, I
don't see how they can prove it.

551
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,195
I think we just go quiet
until they stop following us.

552
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,447
- What do you mean "go quiet"?
- Stop fucking around with the Death Note.

553
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,032
Is that what you think we're doing?

554
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:25,202
Come on, Light. Just get rid
of them. All we need is a name.

555
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,965
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Not gonna do what?

556
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,999
- I was talking to Ryuk.
- I like this one, Light.

557
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,420
- She has wonderful ideas.
- What'd he say?

558
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,797
Ryuk? Not much.

559
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,216
- We're good. They're trying to stop us.
- We don't kill innocent people, Mia.

560
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,135
Even if I wanted to, which I don't,

561
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,762
taking out the guy following us
will only indicate that it's me.

562
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:47,266
You'd have to get rid of all the agents,
regardless of who they're following.

563
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,767
They wouldn't know who it was,

564
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,186
but they'd know what happens
when you fuck with Kira.

565
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,314
- Can't believe you're saying this.
- Cant believe you're not.

566
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,985
Then I guess we're really
fucking lucky that it's my book.

567
00:44:57,955 --> 00:45:00,862
Kira has been strangely
inactive of late,

568
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,532
something authorities
are eager to point to

569
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,119
as evidence their investigation
is gaining momentum.

570
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,748
However, Kira supporters
have begun to criticize police

571
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,666
for suppressing its activities,

572
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,628
as a small but noticeable
spike in global crime

573
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,924
has become apparent in the absence of
recent activities from the phenomena.

574
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,550
Are you leaving?

575
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,719
Yeah, I've got some work to do.

576
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,138
There's a guy on the news
who killed a couple kids.

577
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,681
I thought maybe we
could make some popcorn,

578
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,892
take some names down for later.

579
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:30,937
I'll see you tomorrow.

580
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,712
Director Pearl. These just
came in from the field offices.

581
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,548
Tell them to keep surveillance
on all the potential...

582
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,226
Assistant Director Pearl is
dead. Heart attack, just now.

583
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,813
We need to contact every
FBI agent on their team.

584
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:20,943
This is Franks.

585
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,903
Agent Franks, your team
has been compromised.

586
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:25,867
Drop what you're doing and get to
the nearest hospital. Right now.

587
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
Agent Franks?

588
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,454
Agent Franks, can you hear me?

589
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,455
Twelve FBI agents
mysteriously commit suicide.

590
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,207
Some sources say it
was the work of Kira.

591
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,337
This is the first time Kira
has attacked law enforcement.

592
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:23,883
- Slow down for one second?
- He did it! Son of a bitch killed them.

593
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:25,841
- Ryuk?
- There's so many rules in that thing!

594
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,468
There must be some kind of loophole.

595
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,346
What's he gonna do if you go after him?

596
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,306
Maybe you just need to
take a minute and relax

597
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,685
and see if this was the best
thing that could've happened.

598
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:36,896
No.

599
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,942
Ryuk!

600
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,693
You think I'm some dog, Light?

601
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,696
You can just snap your
fingers and I'll come running?

602
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,283
- Did you kill those FBI agents?
- What do you think?

603
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,203
I decide who dies, you obey
me. Those are the rules.

604
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,872
- Who do you think wrote the rules?
- Whose side are you on?

605
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,249
There are no sides, only the game.

606
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,211
And I knew eventually you
wouldn't be able to handle playing.

607
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,463
I asked politely, but
you didn't hear me.

608
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:05,923
Let the note go.

609
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,634
Look at the strife it's causing
you and your little girlfriend.

610
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:12,137
Let me find it a new home.
We'll be free of each other.

611
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,306
I'm not gonna give the
note to you or anybody else,

612
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,392
and if you fuck with me again,
I'm gonna put your name in it.

613
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,189
You could try.

614
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:25,943
But I warn you, there are
four letters in my name.

615
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,614
Most anyone's ever gotten were two.

616
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,994
Mm.

617
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,881
We interrupt this to take
you live to an announcement...

618
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,716
- What the fuck is he doing?
- By James Turner,

619
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,677
local head of the Kira investigation.

620
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:52,636
Oh, shit.

621
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,223
Those of you that harbored any
illusions about what Kira really is,

622
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,559
the cold-blooded murder
of a dozen FBI agents

623
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,769
should lay bare his true nature.

624
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:05,357
Kira is a cowardly criminal thug
concerned only with self-preservation.

625
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,317
Not only is he unworthy

626
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,196
of the veneration and celebration
he's received in certain circles,

627
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,741
as of today, he's not
even worthy of our fear.

628
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,953
Understand this, Kira.

629
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,204
You may strike me down,

630
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,456
but another one will
stand up and take my place.

631
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,750
Why would he do that? He's
forcing Kira to retaliate.

632
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,170
And another for as long as need be.

633
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,296
We will not waiver.

634
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,423
- Because he's not afraid.
- We will not submit.

635
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,177
And we will not fail.

636
00:49:38,757 --> 00:49:39,852
Where is it?

637
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,061
What? Are you out of your
mind? That's my fucking dad!

638
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,671
Yeah, and he just dared us to
kill him on live television.

639
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:48,384
Think people are gonna be on their
knees if he can talk to Kira like that?

640
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,153
We're not killing my dad!
This is over! Ryuk fucked us!

641
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,531
We're not the good guys anymore.

642
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,499
What happened to the boy that
wanted the world to get what he got?

643
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,039
Think about your mom, Light.

644
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,252
Either Kira stands up
or they hunt us down.

645
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,006
If you want out, then
just get the fuck out!

646
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,013
So you just want to quit?

647
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,225
I don't know.

648
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:35,405
Well said, James. Tell me, are
you truly ready to give your life?

649
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,617
If that's what it takes.

650
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,330
How long will it take
him to decide, I wonder?

651
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,508
What's going on?

652
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,184
Let me take this.

653
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,814
- Turner.
- This is L.

654
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,816
Just making sure you hadn't died.

655
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,109
Still here.

656
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,196
Excellent. Carry on.

657
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,744
I'm really proud of you.

658
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,626
Understand this, Kira.

659
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,837
- You may strike me down...
- Sir?

660
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,715
- But another will take my place.
- Light Turner is Kira.

661
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,384
- And another and another...
- How long since you've slept?

662
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,386
for as long as need
be.. Thirtyone hours.

663
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,848
- We will not waiver. We will not submit.
- Sleep is key to strong thought.

664
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,725
- Trust me.
- And we will not fail.

665
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,562
Nothing's gonna change once I wake up.

666
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:11,170
Hello, Light.

667
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,131
Oh, um...

668
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,548
You're the guy. You're L.

669
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,550
Yeah, well, it's not my real name.

670
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,763
But I'm sure you're
painfully aware of that.

671
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,889
What are you doing here?

672
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,142
Following a lead. You?

673
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,437
Um... I was just... I'm leaving.

674
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,439
I wonder if it was a difficult decision.

675
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,566
If what was a difficult decision?

676
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,861
Sparing your father's life.

677
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,279
Sorry, what are you talking about?

678
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,908
You must've known it would implicate you,
yet you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

679
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,452
I'll admit, I always
wondered if you had a line.

680
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,579
I guess it's fortunate for us,

681
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,833
the line you finally decided to draw
points so clearly in your direction.

682
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,835
- So you really think I'm Kira.
- No, I know it.

683
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,048
If you're so sure, why
haven't you just arrested me?

684
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,843
Because I don't do check,
Light. Only checkmate.

685
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:04,221
- But we'll be there soon enough.
- Great. Until then, enjoy the gelato.

686
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,434
Assuming you can eat through
that thing. And I'll just, uh...

687
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:14,525
Can I ask you something?

688
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,442
Yeah.

689
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,154
How do you think he does it? Kira.

690
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,990
I was hoping you could shed
some light on that for me.

691
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,492
I have a theory.

692
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,245
I think that it's some
form of remote viewing

693
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,623
coupled with maybe some latent psychic
ability of some sort. Am I close?

694
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,209
So you really have no idea, do you?

695
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,088
Well, I have several ideas.

696
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,518
Eventually, you'll tell
me which is correct.

697
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,092
What if it turned out
that all arresting Kira did

698
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:46,054
was give that power to someone
else, someone potentially much worse.

699
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,890
You're suggesting the ability
is somehow transferable.

700
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,393
I'm suggesting maybe what you
and the person you're after want

701
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,310
isn't so different.

702
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,855
Maybe they're as ready to see
the killing end as you are.

703
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,274
And if that were true, perhaps
now would be a good time

704
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,445
to start helping them
instead of hunting them.

705
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,365
Helping...

706
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,701
Hmm...

707
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,788
You know what I think, Light?
I think you want to make a deal.

708
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,999
Good deals are made by those
in a position of strength.

709
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,001
Criminals, such as yourself,
never make those deals.

710
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,920
What they do is wait until
they're caught and then they beg.

711
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,966
I'm not begging. I'm telling
you that you don't understand.

712
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,304
Let me put this in terms
you're more familiar with.

713
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,432
A man kills 400 people.

714
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,977
He tells us that it's complicated,
that he's misunderstood.

715
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,899
Do you think that Kira would hear
his excuses or walk him off a bridge?

716
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,234
Think you're better than me,
but you're trying to kill Kira!

717
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,904
- Kira, Kira, Kira!
- I do not kill, Light!

718
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,864
I don't even carry a
gun, it's distracting.

719
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,951
What I do is bring people to justice.

720
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,954
But the form it takes is their own making.
A consequence of their actions, not mine.

721
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,789
You're the one who flew into the sun.

722
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,127
I'm just here to make
sure you actually burn.

723
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,338
- Well, if that's how it has to be.
- It is, Light!

724
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,801
You know that as well as I do.
There are no draws in this game.

725
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,158
- Please, you have to forgive me.
- It was my dad, Mia.

726
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,869
If I could take it back, I would.
I promise. I was just scared.

727
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:35,082
Do you think I'm not scared?

728
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,460
I'm a fucking cheerleader, Light.

729
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,255
Nothing I do has ever
mattered until I met you.

730
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,841
I made a mistake. If I could
take it back, I would. I just...

731
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,011
I wasn't ready to lose you.

732
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,182
I love you.

733
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,651
I love you.

734
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,869
L showed me his face.

735
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,416
I'm gonna get his name,
and I'm gonna stop him.

736
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,589
That's Watari. He's L's right-hand man.

737
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,010
If anybody's gonna give us L's
real name, it's gonna be him.

738
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,179
All right.

739
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,973
"Watari becomes obsessed

740
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,936
with revealing the true identity
of the detective known as 'L.'

741
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,730
For the next 48 hours, he will cease
all communication with the outside world,

742
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:47,193
except to update what he learns
to the number 206-555-0166.

743
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:51,656
At 7:00 p.m., on October 12th, he dies."

744
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,366
You didn't say how he dies.

745
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,285
- It doesn't matter, it's dealer's choice.
- What?

746
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,912
Huh? Oh, I was talking to Ryuk. Sorry.

747
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,999
- So kill his friend to get his name?
- No, I'm not gonna kill Watari.

748
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,626
That's the best part.

749
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,294
Rule 89 says:

750
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,463
"If the person who writes
a name destroys its page

751
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:09,841
prior to the death being carried
out, the target will be spared."

752
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,013
So if I burn Watari's page
before October 12th at 7:00 p.m...

753
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,722
then nothing bad happens, right, Ryuk?

754
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,476
Only one name can be removed
from the Death Note by burning it.

755
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:22,731
Get this one wrong, you
won't get another chance.

756
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,732
I only get one page to burn.

757
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,368
- Hello?
- My name is Watari.

758
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,038
- This information is not known to me.
- I'm sorry. What do you mean?

759
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,831
I took responsibility for L

760
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,377
only after he left the St.
Martin's orphanage in Montauk

761
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,129
where he was one of the Rochester wards.

762
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,173
One of the... Sorry,
what is a Rochester ward?

763
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,175
They were orphans
trained since childhood

764
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,720
to become the greatest detectives
the world had ever seen.

765
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,806
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- I am not.

766
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,728
For their first test, the wards
were placed in a conditioning vault.

767
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,188
Those who retained their
sanity after seven months

768
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,399
were initiated into the program.

769
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:11,069
L joined at six, the
youngest candidate ever.

770
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,781
Okay, but what was his name
before the vault or whatever?

771
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,492
That name exists now
only in their records.

772
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,829
Okay. Okay. Watari, you
need to go there right now.

773
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,455
I should like to rest first.

774
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:26,209
Sleep is key to strong thought.

775
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,713
No. You don't have any time to sleep.
You have 48 hours to get a name.

776
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:32,173
What happens in 48 hours?

777
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,261
- You just need to go right now.
- I will go.

778
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,891
- Leave him alive, it's a loose end.
- You don't need to help, Mia.

779
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,477
Of course I do.

780
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,731
I'm not gonna leave you alone in this.

781
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,027
Continental America
from Seattle to New York

782
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,322
will be departing from track three.

783
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,761
I'm telling you, I
wore an actual top hat.

784
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,848
- And was that with your wife or...?
- No.

785
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,100
Frankly, she wouldn't have been
caught within ten miles of me.

786
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,229
I didn't get this cool until much later.

787
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,398
Hello. Nice to meet you. Leave.

788
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,109
What are you doing here?

789
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,551
We have a critical issue that
requires discussion immediately.

790
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,697
- Kids, give us a couple minutes.
- Sure.

791
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,824
No, wait, wait, wait.

792
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,325
Not you, Light.

793
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,327
The discussion concerns you.

794
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,329
How?

795
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,588
Watari has disappeared.

796
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,590
I've known him my entire life.

797
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:41,636
He has not, would not, could not leave
without me being sure of his plans.

798
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,972
- Okay, let me make a call.
- What is it that you want?

799
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,100
- Sorry, I don't have any idea.
- I get that this has got you upset.

800
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,562
Your son is Kira, James!

801
01:00:50,118 --> 01:00:51,283
What?

802
01:00:51,286 --> 01:00:53,857
Don't know why you haven't been
able to put one and one together,

803
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,608
even despite him
having spared your life,

804
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,527
but it does not speak well to
your deductive abilities at all.

805
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,612
It's time to leave.

806
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,447
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Wanna fucking bet?

807
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,825
I have a search warrant
and a team of men outside.

808
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:07,412
So, as I said, I will be staying.
You? You have managed a strong move.

809
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,956
Now, provided that you
return Watari to me safely,

810
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,877
I'm willing to put your position
of strength into account.

811
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,254
I'm sorry about your friend.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

812
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,174
Damn it! You don't have...

813
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,633
You have crossed the line!

814
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,595
Force me to do the same and I
assure you you will not survive!

815
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,683
You threaten my son again,
I'll fucking kill you!

816
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,851
Get the fuck out of here!

817
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,272
Tear this place apart! Tear it apart!

818
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,606
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

819
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,609
Yeah.

820
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,414
Has nothing to do with you, son.

821
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,917
I knew he was off the minute I met him.

822
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,671
You know what happens when they find it.

823
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,423
It ends up my book again, Light.

824
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:04,802
And guess what name I'm gonna suggest
we start with when I find it a new home?

825
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,600
Is there...

826
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,063
anything I need to know?

827
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,983
How do you do it?

828
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,694
- How you handle all this?
- What do you mean?

829
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,448
How do you handle having everybody
against you? You're screwed either way.

830
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,909
Yeah, one way or another,
we're all in the middle.

831
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,537
Things are never black and white.

832
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,372
Sometimes you just...

833
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,918
you just have to choose
the lesser of two evils.

834
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,024
♪ And the sky ♪

835
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,736
♪ Hold onto your breath
Hold onto your heart ♪

836
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,656
♪ Hold onto your heart ♪

837
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:06,825
♪ Walk up to the gate ♪

838
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,995
♪ Walk up to the gate ♪

839
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,829
♪ And look up ♪

840
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:16,251
He's coming out of the house right
now. I want a car on him. Every move.

841
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,970
- Hello.
- Where are you? What's taking so long?

842
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,597
- I'm on my way to St. Martin's.
- Well, how much longer?

843
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,850
I hope to find it within
the next few hours.

844
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,560
Find it? You don't know where it is?

845
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,605
It was never intended to be a
place that was easily accessed.

846
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:40,775
Okay, just hurry.

847
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,946
This is a reminder.

848
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,615
Time is running out to purchase
your Winter Dance tickets.

849
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,160
- Hey.
- This is for tonight.

850
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:55,705
Also comes with this. You're
really gonna stand out.

851
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:57,790
You really think I give
a shit about Homecoming?

852
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,461
Look in the hat.

853
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,718
They're never gonna stop following you.

854
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,846
We're gonna end this once and for
all, but I need you to trust me.

855
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,183
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

856
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,418
What do you want, Light?

857
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,212
You're not some sadist.

858
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:11,259
There's always some flimsy
justification, some reason that...

859
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,433
Get me the New York field office. Now!

860
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:04,579
I've asked Brandon here to dance with
me for one. Is that cool with you?

861
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,365
Hey. Where are you?

862
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,618
I've located the records
room, but need more time.

863
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,661
Only got a few minutes.
Is it there or not?

864
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:49,498
I am confident it is here,
but I cannot yet say where.

865
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,586
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it.
Forget it. Just forget it.

866
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,591
No! Mia, what did you
do? Where's the page?

867
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,093
- Watari, you have to run right now! Okay?
- Watari!

868
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,471
You have to run away
as quick as you can!

869
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,348
- Someone's here.
- Okay...

870
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,516
Just go to them right now
and ask for their help.

871
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:11,687
I am obsessed with revealing
the true identity of...

872
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,606
Yes. It's here.

873
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:16,402
- What does it say that it is?
- L's true name...

874
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,280
- What does it say? What is L's real name?
- Sir! Answer me!

875
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,533
Are you Watari?

876
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,244
- I am Watari.
- Watari.

877
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,750
Fuck! Fuck!

878
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:36,253
Ah, you said dealer's choice.

879
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,229
Why didn't you tell me
the page was missing?

880
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,273
But then what would you
and Mia have to talk about?

881
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,151
I told you I like her a lot, Light.

882
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,718
I know you're probably upset...

883
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:07,344
but if you freak out,
they're gonna be all over us,

884
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,849
- and that's not gonna end well.
- You killed him.

885
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,437
No, Light.

886
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,688
I saved you...

887
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,565
from yourself again.

888
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:23,194
Because every time things get hard,
you leave me to do the real stuff.

889
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,737
Oh, my God, it was all you.

890
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,947
Ryuk never found a loophole.
You were the loophole.

891
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,702
You don't get to feel
superior for being a pussy.

892
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,252
I did what I had to do... to protect us.

893
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,726
"Agent Raymond Young...

894
01:11:54,729 --> 01:11:58,020
will write the names of all the
other agents of the Kira task force

895
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:02,608
in the Death Note, placing each of
their faces in his mind as he goes.

896
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,611
When he's done, he will join
them in climbing to a rooftop

897
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,990
and leaping to his death."

898
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:14,119
If you want out, you're out. All I
need is for you to give me the book.

899
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:17,623
Are you insane? Do you think that I'd
ever let you near that thing again?

900
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:18,876
You didn't read it.

901
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,337
What did you do?

902
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:25,297
"Light Turner's heart
stops beating at midnight."

903
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,258
No... you're trying to kill me?

904
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,720
You're going to officially
pass the book to me.

905
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,266
Then once I'm the keeper...

906
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:36,269
I'll burn your page.

907
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,690
That's why I couldn't let you save
Watari. You can only burn one name and...

908
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:43,150
I wanted it to be yours.

909
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,320
There are so many fucking rules.

910
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,078
Now go get my goddamn book.

911
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:12,889
Did you find Watari?

912
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,310
This is Detective Turner.

913
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:04,355
I want every unit looking
for the individual known as L.

914
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,231
He should be considered
armed and dangerous.

915
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:09,362
And I want my son put in protective
custody until he's located. Now!

916
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,938
Let's go! This way! Move, move!

917
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,240
Fuck!

918
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:32,445
Agh!

919
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,362
Be on the lookout for Light Turner,

920
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,698
last seen in the vicinity
of North Seattle High.

921
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:53,757
Ah!

922
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,012
Ah!

923
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:19,866
Hey!

924
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:38,677
Hey, man!

925
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,895
Ah!

926
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:51,522
Light!

927
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,277
Hey, asshole!

928
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,031
Move! Move! Move! Move!

929
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,425
Hey!

930
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:23,097
Hold it right there! Stop! Repeat...

931
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:29,394
Hey!

932
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,157
Whoa! Hey!

933
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:45,743
Hey!

934
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,764
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

935
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,400
- Light!
- Ah!

936
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:19,985
Wait! Wait! Wait!

937
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:23,947
Didn't I clearly explain what would happen
if Watari wasn't safely returned to me?

938
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,034
Wait! You need to understand how it
works, okay? Or you can't stop it!

939
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,118
I couldn't stop it!

940
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,495
Death can be handed out
through a fucking calculus book!

941
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,332
- You're stalling!
- No, I'm not! I swear I'm not, okay?

942
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:35,544
I'm just gonna turn
around really slowly.

943
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:39,521
Okay. I'm gonna reach into my bag.

944
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,258
Don't move! Do not move!

945
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,136
This man is Kira. I'm
working with law enforcement.

946
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,265
In order to capture and eliminate...

947
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:53,353
Lord Kira.

948
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,442
Yeah. Yeah.

949
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:22,800
Out of my way!

950
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,184
Come on! Let's go! Come with me!

951
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,315
Where the fuck is the book, Light?

952
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,608
- Come on!
- We're actually closed, guys.

953
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,735
Take us to the top! Nobody
else gets on, hear me?

954
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,112
Here. Want the book? Get in!

955
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,031
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Take us to the top! Now!

956
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,033
Hit the button!

957
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:08,846
We gotta stop doing this. We
gotta stop doing all of this.

958
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,346
It's already done!

959
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:14,143
Let's run away together and
never use the Death Note again.

960
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,439
I don't want to run away!

961
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,152
Now give me my fucking book, okay?

962
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,197
Take it! But...

963
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,703
just remember what it's done.
Not just out there, but to us.

964
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:34,830
If you love me...

965
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,624
If you love me, then you gotta trust me.

966
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,792
Don't take the book.

967
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,379
Because if you do...

968
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,382
you'll never see me again.

969
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,515
I love you so much.

970
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:55,641
You do?

971
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:00,604
- Light!
- Dad?

972
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,732
Light!

973
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,611
No!

974
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,029
What?

975
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,249
What?

976
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:21,793
What did you do?

977
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,431
You put my name in it, didn't you?

978
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,393
It was if you took the book. I
thought I could convince you not to.

979
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,769
Are you kidding me, Light?

980
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,105
- You put my name in the book! I got mad.
- Are you kidding me?!

981
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:45,609
You said you love me! I thought
you wouldn't take the book!

982
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,619
Light!

983
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,588
Light! Light!

984
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,092
Oh, shit!

985
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,554
Ryuk! I take it back! I take it back!

986
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,562
Here, just hold on! Don't let go!

987
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,162
Please don't let me
go! Don't let me fall!

988
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,505
Four new killings.

989
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:41,509
And every one of them identified by
the news media in the last 48 hours.

990
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:44,346
I understand you think this
means Light cannot be Kira.

991
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,473
You think he's knocking
people off while in a coma?

992
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,391
I'm not exactly sure how it is...

993
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:53,106
Apparently, you have enough highly-placed
allies to keep you out of jail.

994
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:01,531
But none of that's gonna
help you if we see you around.

995
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:00,048
Was there a calculus book
seized at Light Turner's house?

996
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:10,683
Don't take off!

997
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,394
Come in.

998
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:05,154
Hey, Dad.

999
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:22,713
What's wrong?

1000
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,177
It was you.

1001
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,099
All along.

1002
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,274
What are you talking about?

1003
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,361
In your room.

1004
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:55,912
At first, I couldn't figure out how
or why it'd gotten out of my safe.

1005
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:56,957
Then it hit me.

1006
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,877
James Brode wasn't the first victim.

1007
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,297
It was Antony Skomal.

1008
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:15,849
How?

1009
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,106
Do you really want to know?

1010
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,820
Dr. Norman Ludlam,

1011
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:32,532
known for sexually assaulting
female patients under sedation.

1012
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,660
On the night of October 12th,
Norman Ludlam is present at the pier

1013
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:38,748
when two individuals fall from
the Northwest Ferris Wheel.

1014
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,542
He rescues the male
suspect from the water

1015
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,088
and manages to revive
him, saving his life.

1016
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,300
Using his connections at the hospital,

1017
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:54,347
Ludlam keeps the suspect in a
medically-induced coma for two days.

1018
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:57,390
At the end of this period,

1019
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,936
he leaps to his death from
the roof of the hospital.

1020
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,858
Aaron Peltz. Mailman, retired.

1021
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:10,864
Molested nearly a dozen children
over the span of 20 years.

1022
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,826
Peltz retrieves the Death Note
from the river on October 12th.

1023
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,330
Each night, Peltz fills in the
blanks with the name of criminals

1024
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,416
who appear on the news.

1025
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:26,544
On day two, he returns the
Death Note to the Kira suspect,

1026
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:27,546
and then commits suicide.

1027
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:50,070
Mia Sutton is killed when she accepts
the Death Note from her boyfriend.

1028
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,324
As the Northwest Ferris Wheel
mysteriously collapses...

1029
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:58,411
she pulls the page with my
name on it from the note.

1030
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:01,706
And it is ultimately consumed by fire.

1031
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,792
Although her boyfriend
lands safely in the water...

1032
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,337
Mia strikes the shoreline...

1033
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:09,295
dying instantly.

1034
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:27,230
I made a lot of mistakes.

1035
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:30,276
And then I tried to fix
them, but it didn't work.

1036
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,945
I thought it was simple at first: I
was just gonna kill all the bad guys

1037
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:36,489
and the good guys would
win, but it wasn't like that.

1038
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,530
It's like you said...

1039
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,368
sometimes you gotta choose
the lesser of the two evils.

1040
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,246
Which one are you, son?

1041
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:38,426
What?

1042
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:42,180
You humans are so interesting.

1043
01:32:44,044 --> 01:32:48,310
