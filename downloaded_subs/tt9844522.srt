00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>From the beginning of civilization,
we've known there's something captivating</i>

3
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,979
<i>about watching human beings fight
for their lives.</i>

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>That's why we watch gladiator games,
public executions.</i>

5
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:10,487
<i>We created a sport for people
who still have a thirst for savagery.</i>

6
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,905
What did you just do?

7
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,242
<i>Our customers are some
of the most powerful people in the world.</i>

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,743
Real fun game, huh?

9
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,121
<i>Every year they demand more.</i>

10
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,748
<i>More complicated rooms,</i>

11
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,418
<i>more ways to gamble on life and death.</i>

12
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:29,131
<i>And we provided them
with a box seat for life's ultimate drama.</i>

13
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,677
"This serves as an entry voucher..."

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,429
<i>"...for Minos Escape Rooms."</i>

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,472
<i>Are there rules and regulations, or what?</i>

16
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,600
<i>You have to escape
before the clock runs out.</i>

17
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>Anything that looks
like a puzzle or a code.</i>

18
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,564
<i>Numbers are very important.
It could be anything, anywhere.</i>

19
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,236
Zoey, you go first.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,572
They're watching.
They know every move we're making.

21
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,782
They knew everything about us.

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,660
Zoey! Goddamn it. Zoey!

23
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,332
She sacrificed herself for us!

24
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,585
You're the psycho that designed
this murder maze, huh?

25
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,588
No, I'm the Games Master.
The Puzzle Maker designs the rooms.

26
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,881
Ben.

27
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,511
You came back for me.

28
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,804
Yeah. Well, I'm tired
of being the only survivor.

29
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,890
I am not imagining this.

30
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,266
You gotta let this shit go.

31
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,560
Everyone else who was sent
those invitations died,

32
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,355
and whoever sent them is still out there.

33
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,608
The logo. They're coordinates
in the middle of Manhattan.

34
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,235
Are you in?

35
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,569
Yeah, I'm in.

36
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,436
Go and wash up. It's late.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,729
You must be tired.

38
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,608
Okay. Can I say hi to Dad?
I wanna tell him about our day...

39
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,360
No. You know he's busy working.

40
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,113
Okay.

41
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,206
I had a lot of fun today, Mom.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
Not now.

43
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,534
We need to talk.

44
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,952
I am on a deadline,

45
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,497
and you know what happens if I miss it.

46
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,335
We're not doing Claire any favors
by pretending nothing is wrong here.

47
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,296
I've made up my mind.

48
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,257
I can't do this anymore.

49
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,098
You wanna take her away from me?

50
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,186
You wanna break up this family.

51
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:35,359
This family is already broken.

52
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:43,283
I don't have time for this.
I am already behind.

53
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:49,998
We can talk about this
in an hour when I'm finished.

54
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,709
- I'm not gonna change my mind.
- One hour!

55
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,840
Please. Just give me
the chance to talk this through.

56
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:01,593
You can take the time, have a swim,
clear your head and then...

57
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,850
I won't argue, I promise.
I'll just listen.

58
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,604
One hour.

59
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:26,882
Henry?

60
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,592
Henry!

61
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,601
I'm not playing this game.
Please, honey, you don't have to do this.

62
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,395
I'm sorry for what I said. Please. God.

63
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,524
No! No! Damn it, don't!

64
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,658
Okay. Okay.

65
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,954
"I grow in earth. I shrink in wind.

66
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,082
{\an8}I drown in water. I survive in fire.
What am I?"

67
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,334
I can't believe this is happening.

68
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,004
Okay, think. Think! "Grow in earth."

69
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,092
"Shrink in wind. Survive in fire."

70
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,511
It's a rock. Rock.

71
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,558
Okay. What is it? What is it? Okay.

72
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,393
What am I looking for?

73
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,310
Come on.

74
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,730
Come on!

75
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,066
It's a different color. It has to be.

76
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,610
This one.

77
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,031
Okay.

78
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,661
What is it? What is it?

79
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,168
What does it do?

80
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,629
It's a magnet. Okay.

81
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,214
No! Come on!

82
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:53,552
Metal.

83
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,060
Okay. Come on.

84
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,744
Good.

85
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,207
Brace yourself!

86
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,627
Ending sim.

87
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,629
{\an8}You wanna reset?

88
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,966
{\an8}<i>No. Good work.
We're ready for game time.</i>

89
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,600
- <i>What's the probability of survival?</i>
- It's approximately 4%.

90
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,938
<i>I'm so glad
Zoey got over her fear of flying.</i>

91
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,120
It's not too late. You know?

92
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,914
Too late for what?

93
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,879
To get out of here, I guess.

94
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,507
What do you mean?

95
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,927
We could walk away if we wanted to.

96
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,180
We're literally at the gate, Ben.

97
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,099
We could just go grab a slice.
You know, catch a game.

98
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,350
"Catch a game"?

99
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,728
I don't know. I'm just saying...

100
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,315
we don't have to do this.

101
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,818
- You're having second thoughts?
- No, no, I'm sticking by your side.

102
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,321
Look, we were lucky
to get out of those games alive.

103
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,865
I just think that it's okay,
that we can...

104
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,284
keep on living.

105
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,785
I have to do this.

106
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,705
Minos is still killing people.

107
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,460
You don't have to come.

108
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,046
No, here we go.

109
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,717
Flying heroically into danger.

110
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,472
Or flying, you know,
discount economy into danger.

111
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,569
Ensler. How is she today?

112
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,322
She seems focused.

113
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,366
Like always, sir.

114
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,594
One second, I'm almost done.

115
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,055
I did a good job. Don't worry.

116
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,724
Yes, I know, Claire,
you do wonderful work.

117
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,230
I need you to understand
how high the stakes are this time.

118
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,691
What's it matter?

119
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,198
Either way,
I'll still be locked in a cage.

120
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,748
How long do you think
you'd last down here...

121
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,251
if anything happened to me?

122
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,796
Maybe you should've built
these rooms yourself, then,

123
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,048
instead of obsessing
over a way to kill Zoey.

124
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,261
She's not ready.

125
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,433
She thinks that she can expose us.

126
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,894
Chrissake.

127
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,521
Maybe I just understand her
a little bit better than you do.

128
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,773
I mean, we both know
what it's like to lose our mom.

129
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,127
Thanks, sir.

130
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,421
- Hi. There we go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

131
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,881
Next passenger.

132
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,218
Next passenger.

133
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,220
Next.

134
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,269
Your ticket, ma'am.

135
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,439
Ma'am?

136
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,736
Have a nice flight.

137
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,122
Zoey. Hey.

138
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,958
Zoey, are you all right?

139
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,170
<i>Zoey.</i>

140
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,005
<i>Zoey, honey.</i>

141
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,007
Zoey! Are you okay?

142
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,552
Honey.

143
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,596
- Are you excited for Vietnam?
- Mom?

144
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,100
I don't think I can do this.

145
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,936
- I can't do this.
- Yeah, okay. So let's go.

146
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,813
- No.
- Hey, Zoey!

147
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,524
Stop. Hey, stop.

148
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,365
They said we could only afford
the shittiest car they had, but...

149
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,245
I managed to boost us up to a four-door
with a broken windshield wiper.

150
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,665
As long as we sign the release.

151
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,959
How are you still willing to come with me?

152
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:04,506
I mean, I wanna stop Minos and everything,
but I can't even get on the plane.

153
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:07,843
Look...

154
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,558
I didn't wanna tell you this, but...

155
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,687
I got fired from my job.

156
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,859
I had a panic attack in front of a client,
we were...

157
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,280
walking out of a door, it got stuck,

158
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,324
and I broke down.

159
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,581
So you're not alone in feeling this way.
Okay?

160
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:46,465
Plus, I tend to have this weird
loyalty thing for people who save my life.

161
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:49,801
Thanks.

162
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,724
Don't thank me too much. You're the one
that's gotta drive the whole way.

163
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,771
Let's do it, yeah?

164
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,815
Sure you don't wanna stop in Cleveland?

165
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,026
Ben, I said no detours.

166
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,948
I know this is a lot to ask,
so thank you for coming with me.

167
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,701
Well, don't thank me too much.

168
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,162
I don't have any gas money.

169
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,499
Actually don't have any money.

170
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,462
No. I'm not spending the next two days
in a car full of smoke with you.

171
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,303
<i>Should we go to bed?</i>

172
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,306
- Are you tired?
- No.

173
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,474
But...

174
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,143
we should try, right?

175
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,146
Yeah.

176
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,238
- Go ahead. No, you go.
- You go. You stood up first.

177
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,282
No, no, no. You go. No, go.

178
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,700
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

179
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,999
Smooth move, man.

180
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,021
Okay.

181
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,444
Ben? Ben, it's locked! I can't get out!

182
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,863
- Zoey? Zoey!
- Ben! Ben! I can't get out!

183
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,573
Come on! We gotta go!

184
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,116
Zoey!

185
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,412
No, no, no. No!

186
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:41,914
Shit!

187
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,959
No, no, no! No!

188
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,214
Oh, shit!

189
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,843
No, no, no!

190
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,142
No! No, no, no!

191
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,940
Shit. Oh, shit.

192
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,319
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong? What's wrong?

193
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,112
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

194
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,781
Oh, shit.

195
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,786
Hey, I think you just had a nightmare.

196
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,663
I saw... I saw the...

197
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,915
The whole thing was just...

198
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,500
Just a dream.

199
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,127
Yeah. It was just...

200
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,588
- We gotta get these guys.
- Yeah.

201
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,174
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

202
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,386
{\an8}<i>We're almost there.</i>

203
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,263
{\an8}<i>It's an abandoned government building.</i>

204
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,056
<i>There's no record, there's no deed.</i>

205
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,724
<i>It's a total black hole.</i>

206
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,981
This is it. We're here.

207
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,613
Looks like Minos went out of business.

208
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,534
Are we sure we got the coordinates right?

209
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,494
This doesn't make any sense.

210
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:10,460
Look. This was from two days ago.
It's filled with workers.

211
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,504
This has to be the right place.

212
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:22,472
Can we just circle the perimeter
before we enter this hell-trap nightmare?

213
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,516
- You stay out here.
- That's not what I meant.

214
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,101
Hey, just stop.

215
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,438
Wait, no. Zoey.

216
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,237
Can we just look at the coordinates again?
Maybe we got a number wrong.

217
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:38,780
Come on. I...

218
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,951
We shouldn't be in here.

219
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:46,246
We need answers. We came this far,
we have to figure this out.

220
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,706
It's all locked. There's no use.

221
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,166
- No!
- There's nothing in there.

222
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,420
Let's just retrace the steps.

223
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,672
- There has to be something in here.
- Hey!

224
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,758
What's up, guys?

225
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,929
You guys shouldn't be here.
It's not safe. This place is condemned.

226
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,514
Yeah, I think...

227
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,974
I mean, I can help you get in there.

228
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,270
I haven't eaten
in a couple of days though.

229
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:14,691
- Can you maybe help me out?
- Look, I don't... Hey!

230
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,818
- Hey!
- What the hell? Come on, stop!

231
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,071
- Come back!
- Come on, get back here!

232
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:21,573
Stop!

233
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,830
Stop him! Come on!

234
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:29,998
Hey!

235
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,043
- Hey!
- Stop!

236
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,170
Watch it!

237
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,172
Slow down!

238
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,426
Out of the way!

239
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:45,973
Hey!

240
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,183
Somebody stop him!

241
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,396
- Ben!
- Zoey, come on!

242
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,023
Assholes.

243
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,943
Hey! Get back here, man!

244
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,449
- Hey!
- Get him! Get him!

245
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,122
No, no, no. No.

246
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,875
Oh, shit.

247
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:17,421
Okay, look,
we'll find a cop at the next station.

248
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,965
Maybe there's some surveillance footage
or something.

249
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,634
No, there's no point. It's gone.

250
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:25,721
That was my mom's.

251
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,726
I'm sorry.

252
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:37,482
Look, we should get off at the next stop
and go back to the building.

253
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,860
- Yeah.
- There's something there, I know it.

254
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,654
Yeah. We're gonna find our own way in.

255
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,239
No matter what.

256
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,744
Just, new rule,
no more talking to junkies.

257
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:53,248
Hey, baby. You're not gonna believe
where I am right now.

258
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,876
No, I am on the train.

259
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,754
I couldn't get the damn thing
to start this morning.

260
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,214
Had to leave the car at the gym.

261
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,842
Yeah, I know.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

262
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,722
Because! Listen, when I make my baby
a promise, I keep it.

263
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:10,682
Okay.

264
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:15,229
Hey, that was one time.
Your mother doesn't like...

265
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,313
Do you hear that?

266
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,233
Train noises.

267
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,241
Yeah, I hear that.

268
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,335
What's going on?

269
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,129
Isn't the conductor supposed
to be in here?

270
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,881
Yeah. I don't know.

271
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,272
- Hey.
- What just happened?

272
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,150
That's bad, right? Holy shit.

273
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,944
Hey, baby, I'll call you back, okay?

274
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,364
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know. The train just uncoupled!

275
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,908
- What do you mean, uncoupled?
- They separated!

276
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,869
- What do I do?
- I don't know!

277
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,872
- Hit the button!
- I have hit the button!

278
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,001
- Hey!
- Hey!

279
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,719
Hey! Hold on to something!

280
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,056
- Stop touching shit!
- Do something!

281
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,898
Shit! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

282
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:41,940
Baby?

283
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,736
Tiff, can you hear me?

284
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,237
Oh, shit.

285
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,574
Is that the end of the track?

286
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:51,909
Oh, no, no, no!

287
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,124
- Run! Run!
- Go, go, go!

288
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,348
Hey. Hey!

289
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,059
Hey. Let me see.

290
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,520
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you?

291
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,563
Okay, you're not bleeding.

292
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:22,773
Where are we?

293
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:24,983
My head.

294
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,210
- Okay.
- Come on. Get up, you got this.

295
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,670
Come on, come on.

296
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:45,838
Is everyone okay?

297
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,674
Hey, man, you're leaking.

298
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:54,179
- Don't you think it's early for that?
- This day just gets better and better.

299
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:58,308
How long you think
till someone comes for us?

300
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,687
I don't know. It's like 100 miles
of derelict track down here.

301
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,900
And no one knows where the hell we are,
so I'd say long as hell.

302
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:07,985
Great.

303
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,571
I'm not getting a signal.

304
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,739
Let me know when the cavalry arrives.

305
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:13,824
Hold on a second.

306
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,326
Looks like we're in an abandoned station.

307
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,786
You're shitting, right?

308
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,373
Hey!

309
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,085
Hello?

310
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,506
Hey, you got six people trapped in here.
Somebody sending help?

311
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,301
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

312
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,345
<i>Keep your belongings
in sight at all times.</i>

313
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,892
<i>If you see a suspicious package,
please tell the nearest MTA employee.</i>

314
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,686
<i>Remain alert and good luck.</i>

315
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,399
Minos found us.

316
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,695
Did you just say "Minos"?

317
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,697
It's happening again.

318
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,783
No. No.

319
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,537
No. No, no, no.

320
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,790
No, I knew I shouldn't have
come back. Oh, my God.

321
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:06,418
Wait. What, you guys have played
the game before?

322
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,714
How do you think I got this, huh?
They locked me in a goddamn submarine.

323
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,760
Then they increased the air pressure
until my eardrums burst.

324
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,179
So that makes this what?

325
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:19,890
Tournament of champions?

326
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,018
No. No!

327
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,395
No! No!

328
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,524
Let me out!

329
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:32,110
I'm not playing this game again,
you no-good pieces of shit!

330
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,404
Hey, hey, hey! You're making it worse!

331
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,698
Don't make it worse, okay?
Don't make it worse.

332
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:42,204
If they can hijack a train,
they can reinforce the doors, okay?

333
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,081
It's my wife's birthday today.

334
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,252
I told her I wouldn't be late.

335
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,215
I'm always late.

336
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,141
I should've done more.
I should've convinced you not to come.

337
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,977
Ben, Ben, Ben. Look at me.

338
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,647
Look, we broke out once.
We'll do it again. I promise, okay?

339
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,317
You gotta get
that fantasy out of your head.

340
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,737
Okay, we've all been through this before.
We solve the puzzles, we win.

341
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,824
- We go free.
- You mean, one of us does.

342
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,288
What's that sound?

343
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,928
What the hell is that?

344
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,297
- No.
- I don't like the sound of that.

345
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,107
Shit! Shit, I just got shocked.

346
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,151
- You all right?
- Yeah.

347
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,111
They electrified the entire car?

348
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:41,156
We all know how this works.
We play the game or we die.

349
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,160
This is exactly what they want us to do,
dance for their amusement.

350
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:48,330
I don't know about you,
but I'm not dying on nobody's Q Train.

351
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,544
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

352
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,214
<i>Keep your belongings
in sight at all times.</i>

353
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:01,844
<i>If you see a suspicious package,
please tell the nearest MTA employee.</i>

354
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,388
<i>Remain alert and good luck.</i>

355
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,432
Hey, I found a bag.
This belong to any of you?

356
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,101
What's in it?

357
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,189
There's a towel...

358
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,859
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, careful, bro.

359
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:23,031
Okay. Let's find out
what that handle goes to.

360
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,283
Everyone split up.

361
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,494
- All right. Careful about the poles.
- Seriously, homeys.

362
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,413
It's gotta be to one of the doors.

363
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,541
The handle's metal
so we need to be careful.

364
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,765
- I think I found the way out.
- Does it need the handle?

365
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,643
No. It's a trapdoor.
There's gotta be another way to open it.

366
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:54,730
Jesus Christ. Come on, guys.
You aren't listening to the whole clue.

367
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:58,817
They said report any of this shit
to the MTA employee, right? Right?

368
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,319
That's the conductor booth.

369
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,905
- Just give me the damn thing.
- Will you be careful?

370
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,365
Yeah. We don't have a choice, all right?

371
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,576
Shit!

372
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:13,498
Hope you enjoyed that, assholes.

373
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:15,959
Wait a minute.

374
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,505
- Leather's an insulator.
- Yeah, yeah, that's smart.

375
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,217
Okay.

376
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:29,556
Hey, it worked!

377
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:41,568
Shit!

378
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,070
- You okay?
- Yeah.

379
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:44,905
Playing makes it worse.

380
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,783
It's... It's one
of those old subway token slots.

381
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,244
I haven't seen one since I was a kid.

382
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:53,997
Okay, so we need tokens.
Anyone see any tokens anywhere?

383
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,207
What does that sign say?

384
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,586
"All false advertising must be pulled."
Maybe the tokens are behind the ads?

385
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,297
{\an8}But the frames are metal,
so we need a tool to pull them off.

386
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,424
No, wait. "All false advertising."

387
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,969
Yeah, I noticed something earlier.

388
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,930
Right here.
This ad for Hourglass Bay, it says:

389
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,558
"Lose yourself in the sand."
"Yourself" is missing an E.

390
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:16,353
Check all the signage. See if there are
any more misspellings. Okay?

391
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:20,232
Nothing.

392
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,402
Here! C.

393
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,654
{\an8}There's a C missing in "statistic."

394
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:29,366
Okay, C, E...
They're trying to spell something out.

395
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,994
Wait, wait, wait. What did the clue say?

396
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,871
"All false advertising must be pulled."

397
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,414
The missing letters...

398
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,126
Has everybody noticed
how many handles there are?

399
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,545
- Who counts how many...?
- Twenty-six.

400
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,547
- Like letters in the alphabet.
- Right.

401
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,008
We pull the corresponding handles
of the missing letters.

402
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:49,344
The metal handles?
I hope no one has a heart condition.

403
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:50,762
What if we use the towel?

404
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,723
No, cotton is not a good enough insulator.

405
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,850
Is there anything else in the bag?

406
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,811
Wait, the lining is rubber.
We could use this.

407
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,105
Does anybody have keys, so I can cut it?

408
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,608
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

409
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,698
Does anybody wanna hand me keys?

410
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,910
My bad.

411
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,414
Pass them down.

412
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,792
Great. We're rubbered up.
Which one are we pulling?

413
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,920
Hey, there's a green handle here!

414
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:26,006
I noticed a red one at the other end.
Green is A, red is Z, right?

415
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:27,966
Maybe this is where we start.

416
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,302
Okay. C is the third letter
of the alphabet, so...

417
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,389
Okay. Any objections?

418
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:35,849
No, go for it.

419
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,393
No. You got this.

420
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:47,903
A C, that's one.

421
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:52,366
Hey, look! Letters. Two Cs.
That's gotta mean something, right?

422
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:57,454
It's getting worse.

423
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,582
- Come on, keep moving!
- Go, go, go!

424
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:03,710
- Come on!
- No shock.

425
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:06,630
It must be grounded.
We need eight more tokens.

426
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:11,510
Okay. "Lose yourself." A, B, C, D, E.

427
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,681
- Yes!
- Everybody split up, look for letters.

428
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,266
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

429
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,811
Shit, we're running out of time.

430
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,021
Seven!

431
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,108
Check the back of the train.
Gotta be something there.

432
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,360
What the hell
does half this shit even mean?

433
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,485
There's an extra M here!

434
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,989
- And an A! An A missing.
- I'll get the A!

435
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:36,659
M! M! Ready?

436
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,328
Go!

437
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,581
We need five more!

438
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,002
Oh, my God. Hey!

439
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:46,587
Oh, God!

440
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,045
- I'll get the token.
- She okay?

441
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,380
- I got you.
- She okay?

442
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,507
- She's fine. Keep going.
- Where's the token?

443
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:52,634
This is missing a K!

444
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:55,429
"Call a cab in advance."
There's an extra L here too.

445
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,389
All right. Back to L!

446
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,850
- You got the L? Okay!
- I got L!

447
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,145
- Five more.
- Oh, shit. It's a game of Hangman.

448
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,105
This is gonna suck!

449
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:15,824
- This can't be happening.
- Hey! Give me the token!

450
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,201
Give me the token!

451
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,328
Go, man, go!

452
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,247
Everybody stay down!

453
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,126
Get up, Theo, get up!

454
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,672
- Zoey, what are you doing?
- It's the proof we came here for!

455
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:33,091
- Get down!
- Hurry up!

456
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:36,678
Where are the other letters?

457
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,103
There's three!

458
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:46,230
Okay.

459
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:59,326
Guys! Guys, I found the missing letter...

460
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:23,684
He's dead!

461
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:24,935
Oh, shit.

462
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,859
- Do we know what letters he found?
- No, the map is burnt out!

463
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,113
Zoey! Got any ideas?

464
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,872
The missing letters are W, B, and O!

465
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:47,875
- How do you know?
- I just know. Just do it!

466
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,678
B, O!

467
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:10,063
Go!

468
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,241
One more!

469
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,869
I'm coming!

470
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,914
- Sleep well, brother.
- Oh, shit!

471
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,209
Hand it to me! Give me the token!

472
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:40,802
The door is open!

473
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:44,223
All right! Go! Go, go! Get out of here!

474
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,311
Come on, go!

475
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,443
Zoey, hurry! Jump!

476
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,161
Everybody stay down!

477
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:08,205
Stay down!

478
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,001
We're moving!

479
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,087
We're going down.

480
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,522
Hey, wait. Somebody just died.
Can we just have a moment?

481
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:38,068
Maybe we should have a minute of silence.
I mean, we did just lose somebody.

482
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:41,822
You can be as silent as you want.
They're eating this shit up.

483
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,907
Anybody even know his name?

484
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:48,412
No.

485
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:51,623
I'm Brianna.

486
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,417
I'm Nate.

487
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,918
I'm Rachel.

488
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:56,920
I'm Ben.

489
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:58,755
Zoey.

490
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:04,303
Hey, did the train mean anything
to anybody?

491
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:07,681
It was horrible. We almost died.
Does that count?

492
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:11,185
No, no, I mean,
this is all part of a puzzle, right?

493
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,730
So for our groups,
we were all lone survivors.

494
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,900
So if the rooms were tailored
around our accidents...

495
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,527
Maybe the last room was designed
for the guy who died in it.

496
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:23,697
Okay, well, what about your groups?

497
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,868
- Do you think there was any connection?
- My group was all influencers.

498
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,621
What, so your special skills were selfies?

499
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:34,082
No, my special skill was travel blogging.

500
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,794
Camping in Atacama,
elephant sanctuaries in Thailand.

501
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:39,671
That kind of thing.

502
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:44,218
Got a million followers, made some money,
and then this scar happened.

503
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,346
My last room was
an exploding hall of mirrors.

504
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:50,224
It's just a weird category, is all.

505
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,684
I got a letter from my diocese.

506
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,603
Oh, so you're a priest?

507
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:02,027
It called me to some interchurch seminar
or something.

508
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:06,031
- When I get there...
- Let me guess. Five more priests?

509
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,325
Beginning of a bad joke, right?

510
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:15,874
You see, in ours they wanted to see
if faith helped us survive.

511
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,461
Well, you survived.

512
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,634
I keep walking around up there, so lost.

513
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:29,304
I mean,

514
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:32,766
- I just don't understand.
- Understand what?

515
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,519
Why God spared me.

516
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:38,188
Maybe that's enough story time...

517
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,690
Wait, wait, wait.

518
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,109
When I won the game,

519
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,737
some vaguely European asshole tried
to strangle me to death.

520
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,240
Only reason I got out was because of Zoey.

521
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,952
So, what, they just let you all go free?

522
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:55,163
They gave me a hug, called me an Uber.
It was a really pleasant experience.

523
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:58,709
We're just trying to find a pattern.
That's it. That's all.

524
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,587
They're betting on something.
What's the angle?

525
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,463
You can't outthink Minos.

526
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:06,466
Trying to is just going
to put us all at risk.

527
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,678
She's the only one here
who saved somebody except for herself,

528
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:12,139
- so why not listen to her?
- I heard you on the train.

529
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,017
Sounds like listening to her is
what got you back into this mess.

530
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,647
Maybe we should keep moving.

531
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:42,044
An art deco bank of death. Great.

532
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,921
They built a bank underground?

533
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:46,340
This is crazy.

534
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,635
Look, the vault door's open.

535
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,556
- There's no way it's that easy.
- Yeah, definitely not.

536
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:58,435
- Clearly, they're baiting us.
- Yeah, you think?

537
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:01,605
Zoey? What's wrong?

538
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:05,651
Goddamn it!

539
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,657
<i>Security system activated.</i>

540
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,200
Nobody touch anything.

541
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:24,169
It's the tile.
You need to step both feet off of it.

542
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,255
- It's triggering the lasers.
- Help me.

543
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:27,840
- I'm gonna guide you.
- I'm stuck.

544
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,216
Take my hand.

545
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:31,301
Just listen to me.

546
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,929
Lower your body. Nice and slow.

547
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:35,889
Slow.

548
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:38,392
- Steady. Careful.
- Wait, wait, wait.

549
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:41,270
You're gonna lift your left foot
and bring it over to me.

550
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,354
Yeah, good.

551
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:46,525
When you're ready. There you go.
Over to me. Nice and slow.

552
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:47,901
Really low. You got it.

553
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:51,029
- I got you.
- A little bit lower. You got it.

554
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:52,489
On the count of three.

555
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:53,532
Three.

556
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,242
- Two.
- Two.

557
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:56,869
- One.
- One.

558
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:57,953
Shit.

559
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,415
- Is she okay?
- No, no, don't.

560
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:02,833
I know. Don't touch it.

561
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,878
Yeah. It looks like
the skin is fused to the shirt.

- Oh, shit.

564
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:12,342
That is the way out.

565
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,803
There has to be another way
across those tiles.

566
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:16,513
We can't exactly test them.

567
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:19,308
- Maybe we can go around?
- Great.

568
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:21,143
Might as well be a mile away.

569
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,897
Hey, guys? I think I found a key.

570
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:29,359
- Inside the lollipop. It's a key, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

571
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:35,908
Well, those are safety-deposit boxes.
It's gotta be for one of them.

572
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:41,622
Wait, we don't know
if it's safe over there yet.

573
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:44,875
This is where the clue leads.

574
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,087
These tiles are different
than the ones in the middle, so...

575
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:52,633
Zoey, be careful.

576
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,885
Clock's ticking. We have no choice.

577
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:00,641
Safe.

578
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:03,435
Okay. Look for some more keys.

579
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,312
There's more boxes on the other side.

580
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,064
See if we can find any more.

581
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:13,779
"You are here"?

582
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,280
No shit.

583
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,994
There's too many boxes.
We're missing something.

584
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,414
"To be filed." Where is it?

585
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:32,506
- Found a key.
- Yes!

586
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:33,924
I found another key!

587
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:37,344
- Try the boxes on the other side.
- We'll check over there.

588
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:42,850
Brianna. Come on.

589
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,481

00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,672
We need a PIN code.
What's that? Four numbers.

597
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:16,341
Four numbers? Yeah, okay.
We're looking for four numbers.

598
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:19,052
Let's see, is there one...?
Shit. All these are three.

"Sonya." Who's Sonya?

605
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:37,696
Oh, my God.

606
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,241
Here. Only one way to find out.

607
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,160
Come on, come on.

608
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,125
Rachel, look, there's something in here.

609
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:54,546
Shit! Shit, that's really sharp.
I'm bleeding.

610
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,717
We got a box with the name "Sonya" on it
and some razor-sharp diamonds.

611
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,011
- Anything else?
- We got a box like that too.

612
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:05,140
It says "Sonya" on it.
And there's two stacks of blank bills.

613
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,808
- I don't know what it means.
- Okay.

00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:15,567
We're missing something.

of a death of a loved one."

618
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:22,449
Wait. What do you call it
when you get paid for a death?

619
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:25,702
Blood money.
Hurry, bring the bills over here.

620
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:27,454

624
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:43,053
Rachel.

- Okay.

- Priest guy, get the bills.
- The bills okay?

629
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,813
- Yeah, this one's good.
- All right.

630
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:54,940
- Bring them here. Careful.
- I hope that's enough.

631
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:57,192

00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:02,531
Oh, what is that? Okay.

633
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:03,782
It's working.

634
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:07,578
Okay, 0-5-2-6. Try that.
Try 0-5-2-6 in the ATM.

635
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:09,079
0-5-2-6.

636

638
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:14,918
Everyone see that?

639
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:20,048
{\an8}They stopped moving at 12:09 in New York,
3:02 in London, and 12:03 in Shanghai.

640
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,259
How does that get us across the floor?

641
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:24,178
Hang on. We got another clue.

642
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:25,470
What is it?

643
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:30,350
"Plot a course by the hours of the day.
Count the minutes every step of the way."

644
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:34,229
Okay, maybe it's coordinates
like in chess. Row and column?

645
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:35,647
No, wait. I see it.

646
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:37,649
"Plot a course by the hours."

647
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:40,277
Twelve o'clock is straight.
Three o'clock is right.

648
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,405
That makes sense. So "Count the steps
every minute" must be the distance

649
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:46,867
and that means
that 12:09 is straight, nine steps?

- How do we know where to start from?

652
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,418
This says you start three tiles
from the left.

653
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:59,463
- Three tiles from the left!
- At least, I think so.

654
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,341
I don't know.
We're making a lot of assumptions.

655
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:04,259
We gotta try something, right?

656
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:05,844
Wait, I have an idea.

657
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:08,055
What are you...? Where are you going?

658
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,060
I'm gonna plot a course
for the rest of you.

659
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,312
Careful, okay?

660
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:27,032
Okay. It worked. Okay.

661
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:28,158
One.

662
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:30,619
Two.

663
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:33,413
Three.

664

- Come on.
- You're doing great, Nate.

00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,464
Okay. Okay.

666
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,508
- Nine? Nine. Okay.
- That's nine, right?

667
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:48,095
So it's 3:02 in London,
so try two steps to your right.

668
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:59,648
Okay, third clock, Shanghai, 12:03.

669
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:01,733
That's three steps forward.

What is he doing? No, no, no.

693
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:13,972
- Nate! What are you doing?
- Stop!

694
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:17,684
- No. Wait. Wait. Oh, shit!
- Nate! No, no, no.

695
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:20,020
- Wait! What the hell? Stop it!
- Nate!

696
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:22,147
Just stay there. Stay there.

697
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:26,026
We don't know if those tiles are safe
because we haven't found any clues.

698
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:28,403
So just stop what you're doing!

699
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,948
- Nate!
- No! Stop!

700
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:33,867
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop, please!

701
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,328
You're gonna get us killed! Please stop.

702
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:39,122
Whatever you think you're doing,
it's not helping us.

703
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:40,916
It's okay. It's working.

704
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,544
Stop for two seconds, okay? We just... No!

705
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:48,757
He's gonna kill us.

706
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:51,468
This is why he spared me.
I know you're afraid.

707
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:54,304
- Stop!
- I know... I know you're afraid.

708
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:55,430
Don't be afraid.

709
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:58,475
- I'm not scared! Listen to her!
- You're gonna kill us!

710
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:01,186
You don't need to do this, okay?

711
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:07,276
Zoey! Zoey!

712
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:11,947
Get him up! Come on! Hurry!

713
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,782
Nothing happened when he hit his head.

714
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:16,702
Maybe it's just the end of the counters
that are booby-trapped.

715
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,287
Let's get him off the tiles.

716
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,664
Let's go. Help me pull him up.

717
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:25,294
Careful. Careful!

718
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:31,550
That was close.

719
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:34,511
- Is he okay?
- He's out cold.

720
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:37,514
- We're gonna have to carry him.
- Father Nutbag torched all the clues!

721
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:39,683
The papers weren't the answer.
There was too many.

722
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:40,726
What's the clue again?

723
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:43,896
"Money makes the world turn.
Never let it stop..."

724
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:46,231
Wait. We gotta turn something.

725
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:51,361
- It's stuck!
- Try turning it both ways!

726
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,447
We were never looking for a number.

727
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,574
"Don't let it stop."
Don't let it stop turning.

728
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:57,659
- Oh, shit.
- Got it. I got it.

729
00:51:57,743 --> 00:51:59,077
We got something.

730
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,623
It's a graph, a transparency.
You gotta put it on something.

731
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,499
Maybe it goes on the map. Throw it here.

732
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,460
<i>Full laser-grid activation</i>

733
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,337
- <i>in one minute.</i>
- We're running out of time!

734
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,421
Toss it over!

735
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:12,090
- I'll throw it over the laser tiles.
- You have to throw it.

736
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:15,594
- Throw it over! Hurry! Come on!
- Go! You got it!

737
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:20,933
Okay. Okay, okay.

738
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:23,477
All right. You go and I'll guide you out.

739
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,853
I'm not leaving without you.

740
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:27,731
- We need help to carry the chosen one!
- Just go.

741
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,192
- Hurry up! We gotta get out of here.
- Shit.

742
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,489
- I got the lollipops.
- Here.

743
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,991
I got him, I got him. Careful, careful.

744
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,914
- We sure we need this asshole?
- Take two tiles to the left.

745
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:45,249
One, two.

746
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,834
We're leaving you a path.

747
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:49,211
Okay. Six tiles straight.

748
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:53,048
Two tiles diagonally to the right.

749
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:55,509
One, two.

750
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:58,303
- Two tiles diagonally to the left.
- <i>Full laser-grid activation...</i>

751
00:52:58,387 --> 00:53:00,764
- One, two.
- <i>...in ten, nine,</i>

752
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:04,601
- <i>eight, seven, six, five...</i>
- And then straight all the way up.

753
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:08,146
<i>...four, three, two, one.</i>

754
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:25,539
Shit.

755
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,304
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Come on.

756
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,263
What happened?

757
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:43,765
We almost lost Zoey out there,
that's what happened.

758
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:47,227
- You like being stupid and selfish?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

759
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:49,646
- I'm sorry.
- Is that what you like, huh?

760
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,064
Ben, Ben, Ben! Stop!

761
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:54,318
Okay, enough! He was just trying to help!

762
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,822
Thank you.

763
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,992
For getting us out of there.

764
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:04,578
Yeah, don't worry about it.

765
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:10,834
What's happening?

766
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,127
It's gonna collapse!

767
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,880
Everybody run! Run!

768
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:16,798
- Go!
- Run!

769
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:18,842
Hurry up! Get out of here!

770
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,677
- Go, go, go!
- Hurry up!

771
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,358
Well, that's impressive.

772
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,327
A full 360.

773
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,205
- They did something like this in our game.
- Ours too.

774
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:51,041
This is some next-level shit.

775
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,920
Hundred bucks says they try to drown us.

776
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:56,880
No, are you kidding?
Look at all this sand.

777
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:58,507
Definitely land mines.

778
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:06,181
Check this out. It's a Polaroid camera
and it says something.

779
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,768
- What does that say?
- "It will last longer."

780
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,103
It's like the phrase.

781
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,438
I guess you have to take a picture.

782
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:27,661
What...? What the hell was
the point of that?

783
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:31,164
- It looks like a postcard, right?
- Yeah, like a memory.

784
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,042
There's writing on the back.

785
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,295
It says, "Drop your anchor
at Hourglass Bay."

786
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,463
That's the name
on the billboard behind us.

787
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:41,258
It's just the room.

788
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,552
Yeah, but, no, look at the horizon.

789
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,554
There's a tiny boat
that's not on the wall.

790
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:50,100
So we're looking for something nautical.
Maybe an anchor?

791
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:53,103
- Possibly surrounded by land mines.
- Would you stop saying that?

792
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,981
Can we just be careful
what we're stepping on?

793
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:59,860
- I'm gonna check by the pier.
- The exit has to be in this shack.

794
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:02,738
X marks the spot? I don't know.

795
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,574
I'll bet that fridge is our way out.

796
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,498
You still think the rooms are connected?

797
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:16,668
The beach bag on the train,
Sonya's name in the bank,

798
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:18,754
even the walls changing
like they just did,

799
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:22,674
it feels like it's all connected,
like it's telling a story.

800
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:25,511
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel like it's about us.

801
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:29,097
<i>SOS! Our ship is sinking!</i>

802
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:32,809
- I've got a weird distress call here.
- I got a ship in a bottle.

803
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:35,312
Ship in a bottle.
I'm gonna check this cooler.

804
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,606
Let's see what's behind door number...

805
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:46,823
Zoey. Now we know what that anchor's for.

806
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:49,618
There's a telescope
at the top of the lighthouse.

807
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:51,161
I think I found our boat.

808
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:56,917
{\an8}"Blind Love"? Like the Bon Jovi song?

809
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,294
Guys, Ben figured it out.

810
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,213
Minos is Bon Jovi.

811
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:04,216
Very funny.

812
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:06,552
Let's find an anchor.

813
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:07,678
Careful, guys.

814
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:09,721
Seriously, how did we miss this?

815
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,102
- I don't see anything down here.
- It's just netting.

816
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:17,396
Nothing here.

817
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:21,608
What the...?

818
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,487
- This has to connect to something.
- Wait, look.

819
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:29,575
It's a metal detector.

820
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:33,620
Does it work?

821
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:35,122
Yeah.

822
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:38,292
- Why is it still in my face?
- Let me try.

823
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,044
- Sorry. Here.
- Let me see it. Thank you.

824
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:43,881
My dad found a silver dollar
with one of those once.

825
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,382
It was worth a dollar.

826
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,428
There's nothing here.

827
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,972
What is with these people
and these crazy-ass mannequins?

828
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:00,272
It's gonna be under the sand.

829
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:13,368
- Did you hear that?
- Oh, yeah.

830
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,954
There's something.

831
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:20,209
- You still thinking land mines?
- Nice and easy.

832
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,298
- Here.
- Yeah.

833
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,759
- Zoey, can you bring some shovels?
- Yeah.

834
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:30,177
We found something.

835
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:37,768
I feel something.

836
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:38,894
Lose the shovels.

837
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,188
Come on.

838
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:44,358
- The anchor!
- It's the anchor.

839
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:49,238
- You got it?
- Let's get it to the door.

840
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:54,451
- Oh, shit. That's not good.
- It's tied down.

841
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,078
- It's stuck.
- Pull!

842
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:58,539
- All together.
- Help me grab it.

843
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:00,332
Go!

844
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,252
Pull! Keep going!

845
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:06,255
It's connected to something.

846
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:09,258
- What happened?
- Something's happening.

847
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:11,593
Hear that?
There's something under the sand.

848
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:13,387
- Guys?
- What the hell is that?

849
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:17,474
Where'd it go?

850
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:19,184
- This can't be good.
- The anchor!

851
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:23,355
Give me your hand!

852
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:25,941
- Hey! Get me out!
- Grab him! Grab him!

853
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:33,699
- We're sinking! It's pulling me down!
- Get out!

854
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:35,993
Grab my arm! Grab!

855
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:39,246
- It's got my legs!
- We can't get any closer!

856
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,832
- Reach! Hurry!
- Help me!

857
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:43,000
Grab his hand!

858
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:45,627
Come on!

859
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,421
- Come on, stop it!
- Rachel!

860
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,048
We need something!
We need something to get her.

861
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:52,176
- Stop moving!
- I'm gonna get the ring.

862
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:55,012
Come on!

863
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,514
Rachel!

864
00:59:58,557 --> 00:59:59,975
- No!
- Rachel!

865
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:01,518
Shit!

866
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,690
- Give me the rope.
- You're not going down there.

867
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,734
What are you doing? She's gone.

868
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:11,445
- Listen!
- Hold this, okay? Hold this.

869
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,823
- You're not going!
- Listen! I have to do this, okay?

870
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:16,909
Nate, you're crazy. Stop! Stop!

871
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:19,161
Hold him! Hold on!

872
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:22,706
Just hold it tight!

873
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,004
Rachel! Rachel, you okay?

874
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:30,506
Come out of there. You can do it!

875
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:33,842
- Rachel! Rachel! Grab the rope!
- Come on!

876
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:36,553
- You can do it!
- Get up. Hold it!

877
01:00:37,888 --> 01:00:39,640
Come on! Get it!

878
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:43,185
Okay. All right.

879
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:45,062
Come on, Nate!

880
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:46,522
Nate!

881
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:50,150
Nate! Come on! Go up the rope!
Come on! Nate!

882
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,361
Come on! Go up the rope! Come on!

883
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:53,654
No!

884
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:56,657
We have to help him! We have to!

885
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,951
- The rope's gone!
- He saved me. We have to save him!

886
01:00:59,034 --> 01:00:59,993
Bring the anchor!

887
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:01,995
- Rachel!
- We can't help him.

888
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:05,082
Hurry up! They're gonna sink this too.

889
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,918
Hurry, it's going under us.

890
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:10,337
- Come on, come on!
- Okay.

891
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,214
Rachel, come on, let's go!

892
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:15,092
Rachel, come on. He's gone!

893
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:17,845
There's nothing we can do!
We gotta get out of here!

894
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,515
"Bon voyage."

895
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,229
Guys, I think this is our exit.

896
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,275
The fridge is unplugged.
I found the power cord.

897
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,862
Maybe if we find the other end,
we plug it in, open it, and get out.

898
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:35,821
Yeah. Okay.

899
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:44,288
The light switch, it looks like
the lighthouse in the postcard.

900
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:46,081
There has to be a connection.

901
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,126
Worth a try.

902
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:51,628
'Cause nothing bad happens
when we touch things.

903
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:53,589
Do it! We have to move.

904
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:55,257
Oh, shit!

905
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,175
Hold on.

906
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:03,515
If we don't find the exit,
this whole thing's going down.

907
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:12,900
Look! Look at the lighthouse.
It has a ladder on it now.

908
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:16,195
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- I'm coming with you.

909
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:17,779
Shit!

910
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:20,532
- Help them, in case I'm wrong.
- Okay.

911
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,034
The wood is blocking the exit.

912
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:23,869
- Shit! Get it out!
- Clear a path!

913
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,084
Careful.

914
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:36,882
Clear a path!

915
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:46,850
The light, it stopped!

916
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:48,810
"I can't sea you."

917
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:50,687
The door's clear. Did you find anything?

918
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:54,107
Yeah, there's a message on the sign
and it says, "I can't sea you."

919
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:56,068
But "sea" is spelled S-E-A.

920
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:59,446
- I don't know.
- Come on down. We'll figure it out.

921
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:02,491
The clue is "I can't sea you,"
spelled S-E-A.

922
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:03,408
S-E-A?

923
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:04,493
- S-E-A!
- Okay.

924
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:06,537
I'm gonna go check the boat!

925
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,334
What the...?

926
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,088
No! No!

927
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:18,298
"I can't sea you"?

928
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:21,593
- I don't know.
- Sea salt shakers? I don't know!

929
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:26,348
Okay. Let's see.
"I can't... I can't sea you."

930
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:33,814
Come on! "I can't sea you."

931
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:38,277
- Maybe it has something to do with eyes!
- What?

932
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,155
Not somebody's eyeballs. You can't open
a fridge with somebody's eyeballs.

933
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,448
Okay.

934
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:50,831
Shit!

935
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:02,843
"Blind love" and "I can't sea you." Wait.

936
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:05,929
The mannequin.

937
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:08,390
Yeah, the mannequin!

938
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:12,769
Shit!

939
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:14,229
Come on.

940
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:16,106
Come on.

941
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:21,236
Shit, yeah! I got it!

942
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:25,199
Shit.

943
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:27,534
Zoey, I've got the plug!

944
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:30,037
No, Ben, I think this is another way out!

945
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,663
Here! Take it! Take it!

946
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:41,089
It worked! Ben, go get Zoey.

947
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:45,177
- Zoey, we got the door open! Come on!
- I found a way out.

948
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:47,554
This could be a way out of the game!

949
01:04:47,638 --> 01:04:50,098
Wait, wait! Zoey found another way out.

950
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:52,351
What are you talking about,
she found another way?

951
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:55,854
- This is the way out! Come on!
- What the hell is she doing?

952
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:59,066
- They're not listening to me!
- We have to go! We don't have time!

953
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,985
The whole room's collapsing!
Come on, it's the way out!

954
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,613
If we keep playing,
how many of us die before this is over?

955
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:08,033
We don't know where that's gonna lead.
We have to go here! This is the way out!

956
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:11,078
Even if you win, what makes you think
they'll let you walk away free?

957
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:12,621
Rachel. Come on.

958
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:15,999
You have to trust her.
She saved my life! Hurry, let's go!

959
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,794
- Yeah. Okay.
- Wait... Rachel!

960
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:20,254
- Yeah. Go, go, go!
- Ben!

961
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:22,172
You cannot cheat the game!

962
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:25,926
Brianna, come on! Shit.
Come on! We don't have time!

963
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,302
- Hurry, Rachel!
- I'm coming!

964
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,096
Brianna, come on!

965
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:33,684
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

966
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,229
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

967
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,523
- Come on.
- I'm coming!

968
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:40,649
- Come on.
- I'm coming!

969
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:42,651
Brianna, let's go! Come on!

970
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:46,613
Come on, hurry!

971
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:48,740
- Brianna, come on!
- Shit. Shit.

972
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:52,494
Brianna, let's go!

973
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:55,747
Hurry! We're sinking!

974
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:02,963
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

975
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:06,300
Come on. Okay, okay.
You go in first. Yeah, I got it.

976
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,225
Shit.

977
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:19,771
Hurry!

978
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:21,023
Climb, Ben. Climb.

979
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:22,316
Let's go! Come on!

980
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:26,320
Ben!

981
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:28,197
Ben!

982
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,287
Let's go, come on!

983
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,748
- I'm not gonna make it!
- You got it.

984
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,333
Just make it out alive!

985
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,834
- Come on!
- Come on.

986
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:43,420
Ben! No!

987
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:44,630
Ben!

988
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,507
No, no, no!

989
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:51,053
We have to go now!

990
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:53,847
<i>Zoey!</i>

991
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:55,724
<i>No, no, no!</i>

992
01:06:56,517 --> 01:07:00,479
<i>I tend to have this weird loyalty thing
for people who save my life.</i>

993
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:07,152
Zoey, come on.
You have to leave him. Come on.

994
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:08,445
Zoey, it's sinking!

995
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:12,032
Don't do this, Zoey!
Come on. Give me your hand!

996
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,909
Come on, give me your hand!

997
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,816
It's safe. Come on.

998
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:54,700
I should've just gone the way
he wanted me to.

999
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:56,535
Ben would still be alive.

1000
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:00,289
I lost him.

1001
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:03,041
He was my best friend.

1002
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,210
He died because of me.

1003
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:10,716
I lost him. He didn't even wanna...
He didn't wanna come back.

1004
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:15,220
It's my fault. It's my fault.

1005
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:16,763
Zoey, don't do this.

1006
01:08:19,183 --> 01:08:20,475
It's Minos' fault.

1007
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:22,644
They did this.

1008
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:26,148
- No, I chose to come back into the game.
- I didn't.

1009
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:30,444
I mean, Brianna didn't. Nate didn't.

1010
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:34,488
They would have found you and Ben
one way or another. You know that.

1011
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:36,992
And you were right.

1012
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,368
They're never going to stop
unless we stop them.

1013
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:42,788
You still have your phone, right?
With the video from the train.

1014
01:08:43,372 --> 01:08:46,502
What does it matter?
It doesn't prove anything.

1015
01:08:46,585 --> 01:08:48,377
It's more than we had before.

1016
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:49,921
Right?

1017
01:08:51,756 --> 01:08:52,591
Look.

1018
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:57,345
Everyone went through hell in their games.

1019
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:01,140
I was born with a microdeletion
in one of my genes.

1020
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:05,229
It affects sensation.
I can't feel physical pain.

1021
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:09,483
Just imagine...

1022
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,238
the kinds of puzzles
Minos came up with for the pain freaks.

1023
01:09:15,154 --> 01:09:16,198
You're fighting back.

1024
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:18,533
You're doing the right thing.

1025
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:23,830
We have to go. Come on.

1026
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:31,630
Rach, do...?

1027
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:35,801
You hear that?

1028
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,471
Hey, there's something over there.

1029
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:49,314
Oh, my God.

1030
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:07,833
We made it.

1031
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:15,841
We're out. Come on. Come on.

1032
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:17,509
We're out.

1033
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:20,679
Oh, my God. We're out.

1034
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:25,642
Wait! Don't let it close!

1035
01:10:31,273 --> 01:10:32,566
I don't understand.

1036
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:33,775
What's going on?

1037
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:36,111
We're still in the game.

1038
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:38,989
Oh, no, no, no.

1039
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,996
Oh, my God. What did they do to you?

1040
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:51,043
It's acid. When the timer runs out,
it rains acid.

1041
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,294
Acid? What?

1042
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:55,005
We have to hurry.
We have to find the keys to the bodega.

1043
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:57,799
If we could just get through this lock,
I think it's the way out.

1044
01:10:58,926 --> 01:10:59,760
May 26th.

1045
01:11:01,178 --> 01:11:04,306
- It's 0-5-2-6 again, but we need a key.
- No, but she's holding a key.

1046
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:07,559
- Yeah, but how does that help us?
- We have a minute left.

1047
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:10,812
{\an8}"I'll always be watching over you"
and she's an angel, right?

1048
01:11:10,896 --> 01:11:15,192
Wait! There's a cloud above her,
so we climb it, right? We climb it!

1049
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:18,737
- There's a ladder on the fire escape!
- Okay. I'll climb it.

1050
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:27,329
Bri, do you see anything?

1051
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:30,040
Why are there so many plants?
So many plants.

1052
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:32,292
Come on, come on.

1053
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:37,631
- I found a key! It's stuck to the railing.
- Hurry!

1054
01:11:37,714 --> 01:11:39,675
We only have 30 seconds left!

1055
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,427
- Come on, Brianna. You can do it!
- I got it!

1056
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:45,097
- Here, catch!
- Got it!

1057
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:46,932
Okay, try it. Go, go, go.

1058
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,518
Hurry! Get down here!
It's about to rain again!

1059
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:51,144
Okay.

1060
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:53,689
Okay.

1061
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:54,606
Lift!

1062
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:58,569
Hurry up! Lift the gate!

1063
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,612
It's another locked door.

1064
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:27,598
The rain stopped. They reset the timer.

1065
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:38,775
<i>Conservation activists have started
a chain reaction throughout the city.</i>

1066
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:40,777
<i>With rising water costs,</i>

1067
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:44,531
<i>residents are turning
to urban rainwater collection.</i>

1068
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:45,616
Water collection.

1069
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:50,245
- They want us to collect the rain.
- <i>Conservation activists...</i>

1070
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:51,663
Another awning came down.

1071
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:53,999
<i>...have started a chain reaction
throughout the city.</i>

1072
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:56,877
Okay, chain reaction.
There's a chain on the phone booth.

1073
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:02,424
All right. Okay.

1074
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:07,638
All right. They want us
to answer the phone.

1075
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:10,557
If we collect the rain,
we can use the acid to burn through.

1076
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:12,643
- That could work.
- How do we contain acid?

1077
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:15,354
- Wait, don't touch that!
- No, it's fine.

1078
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,731
- You'll burn your hands.
- I'm fine. I don't feel it.

1079
01:13:17,814 --> 01:13:20,526
Hydrochloric acid burns
through everything but a certain plastic.

1080
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:22,236
Look for anything that hasn't melted.

1081
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:23,362
Yeah. Right.

1082
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:27,115
Everything's melted, even the awnings.

1083
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,159
We only have 20 seconds.

1084
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:31,995
{\an8}Shit.

1085
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:37,084
There's a ketchup bottle here.
There's a bottle hasn't melted.

1086
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,086
Okay.

1087
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:44,883
PMP. Polymethylpentene. Yes, this is it!

1088
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:46,260
Acid won't melt this.

1089
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:48,637
We don't have much time! Let's go!

1090
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,390
- Hurry! Get under the awning!
- All right, hurry!

1091
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:20,627
It worked! It worked.

1092
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,921
Okay.

1093
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:28,093
It's working! It's working.

1094
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:34,516
Go, go, go! Answer it!

1095
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,351
- Go!
- Hello?

1096
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:39,438
Here, let me try it. Hello?

1097
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:40,981
There's nobody there.

1098
01:14:41,481 --> 01:14:43,859
Okay. "When the weather turns,
give us a call."

1099
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:45,861
It must have something to do with the cab.

1100
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:46,778
It's not working.

1101
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,200
- What are you doing?
- Stay in there.

1102
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:53,160
There's not enough room for all of us!

1103
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:55,162
- Come on, let's try.
- We're missing something!

1104
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:57,998
- I don't know!
- You can't stay out there!

1105
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:01,084
- It's not like we really have a choice!
- No, wait.

1106
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:04,838
- We can't do it like this. We can fit.
- Zoey, catch! Use it.

1107
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:15,766
Zoey! Zoey!

1108
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,310
Is she okay?

1109
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:20,854
"Pawnshop." Pawnshop!

1110
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:25,609
"Three rings." Pick up the phone
and put it back down!

1111
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:26,693
What?

1112
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:28,987
Pick up the phone and put it back down!

1113
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:32,282
Now pick it up on the third ring!

1114
01:15:32,824 --> 01:15:34,368
Third ring? Okay. One.

1115
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,416
Hello?

1116
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:44,294
Do you see the cab?
The door, the door, the door!

1117
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:50,551
- Okay. Ready? Go!
- Let's go!

1118
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:53,595
- Go!
- Come on!

1119
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:58,392
- It won't open. They locked it.
- Open the door!

1120
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:00,060
- Get back to the booth!
- Zoey!

1121
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:03,814
- Try the front door.
- The booth! They're cutting us off!

1122
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:08,735
Zoey, it's locked! I can't get it open!

1123
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:14,449
- It won't open.
- They're locked!

1124
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:16,994
- It won't open.
- Try the front! Try the front.

1125
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:18,120
I... I can't!

1126
01:16:18,203 --> 01:16:20,622
- No, no, no!
- There's nowhere to go.

1127
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,626
Brianna, listen to me.

1128
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,337
Don't give them the satisfaction, okay?

1129
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,756
Hey! Hey, don't give up!

1130
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,592
I don't wanna die.

1131
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:32,676
I know.

1132
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:36,430
Come on!

1133
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:43,145
Come on! Come on!

1134
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:51,778
We have an error in the transition chute.

1135
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:54,406
What's wrong?

1136
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:56,658
Just a malfunction. Hold on.

1137
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:03,123
What is that?

1138
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:07,044
Final room.
Ready to activate as soon as you call it.

1139
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:08,378
Pull it up.

1140
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:12,883
When was this design approved?

1141
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:15,928
It was in the expedited changes
you delivered just a few days ago, sir.

1142
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:22,184
And those changes
were delivered on this, huh?

1143
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:24,478
I'm calling it in.

1144
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:28,315
Oh, no, no, no. We play through.

1145
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,733
We've been breached.

1146
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:35,280
Our employers have made it
very clear we continue no matter what.

1147
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:39,952
This is the highest bet-upon match
in our game's history.

1148
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:48,335
Relax. You're okay.
I've brought you to a safe place.

1149
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:52,714
Your head'll clear in a few minutes.
I'm tracking your father's phone.

1150
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:55,717
He's on his way here. I'm going upstairs
to try and buy you some time.

1151
01:17:58,011 --> 01:17:59,137
Be careful.

1152
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:00,973
I'm gonna come back.

1153
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:06,645
Zoey?

1154
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:10,023
Hey. I know you're confused,
but you really gotta listen to me, okay?

1155
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:14,570
- There's not a lot of time.
- Who are you?

1156
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:17,948
I've been watching you for so long,
I forgot we're not already friends.

1157
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:19,449
I'm Claire.

1158
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:23,579
Please be careful, okay?

1159
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:28,000
Look, you're free to go at any time.
But I really need your help.

1160
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:31,295
- So if you could just hear me out. Please.
- Those are the clues.

1161
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:37,885
The subway, the rain,
the bank, the beach. It was...

1162
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,220
It's you.

1163
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:45,559
- The story's about you. Sonya...
- She was my mother.

1164
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:48,228
{\an8}And the mural. That date.

1165
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:50,564
That was the day she died, right?

1166
01:18:50,647 --> 01:18:52,983
I knew you'd be the one
to see me through it all.

1167
01:18:57,821 --> 01:18:58,697
What is that?

1168
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:06,413
- You designed the rooms?
- You don't understand, okay?

1169
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:09,958
My father, he locked me in here.
He forced me to do all of this.

1170
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:11,335
You're a murderer!

1171
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:15,172
I resisted for as long as I could,
but I realized that my only way out

1172
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,966
was if I had your help,
if I gained your trust.

1173
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:19,551
Why would I trust you?

1174
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:22,888
- You killed Ben!
- Because I saved him.

1175
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,973
He's alive, Zoey. Ben's alive.

1176
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:27,184
What are you talking about?

1177
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:29,436
I built a hidden
extractor tank in the sand.

1178
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,730
Ensler got him.
He's in the tunnels, he's safe.

1179
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:34,024
I can show you. Look. Look.

1180
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,401
See?

1181
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:38,070
I saved him, Zoey.

1182
01:19:38,695 --> 01:19:42,241
- Ben?
- After I get out of here, we can get him.

1183
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:44,117
Get him out.

1184
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:47,204
- No, no, no. No. No.
- Wait, what's happening?

1185
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:50,415
No, no, no. No.

1186
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:53,377
- Wait, where'd he go?
- No! My dad's men found him.

1187
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:58,924
Oh, shit. Shit.

1188
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:03,428
Holy shit. Where is she?

1189
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:06,807
Where is she?

1190
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,017
Answer me!

1191
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,771
<i>I'm not gonna play
your stupid game anymore!</i>

1192
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:14,356
You need to do something!

1193
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:17,234
I can't get him out from in here.
The only computer that has access

1194
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:18,902
- is in my father's study.
- What?

1195
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:22,072
We don't have time. I need your help.
Can you please just help me?

1196
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:25,158
What's this? A combination lock!

1197
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:29,746
Four numbers. Really original.
And a puzzle, too, yeah?

1198
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,708
I need somebody as smart as you
to help me solve that.

1199
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:34,293
Everything is a game to him.

1200
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:38,213
He said that no matter how hard I tried,
I would never figure it out on my own,

1201
01:20:38,297 --> 01:20:39,548
which is why I need you.

1202
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:43,093
Okay. Where does it go?

1203
01:20:45,762 --> 01:20:47,723
The images on the left
correspond to a code,

1204
01:20:47,806 --> 01:20:51,018
and I only get three chances until
all the oxygen is sucked out of my cell.

1205
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:54,146
- I already used one on my 18th birthday.
- Okay, so...

1206
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,273
Ben.

1207
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,611
Okay, so insects.
We have a mayfly and then a termite.

1208
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:03,739
It's an African mound-building termite.
They can live for up to 50 years.

1209
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:06,867
Mayflies only live a day, so maybe
it's something to do with life cycles?

1210
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:08,827
Oh, shit! Okay!

1211
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:12,915
So we have iridium, titanium, lithium.
The atomic numbers for that are 3, 22, 77.

1212
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,750
Maybe the atomic weights matter.

1213
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:17,503
Yeah. Okay.

1214
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:19,004
Damn it!

1215
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:20,923
Okay, moments in Greek history.

1216
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:24,092
The Battle of Troy, 1250 B.C.
The Olympic Games, which is...

1217
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:25,469
776 B.C.

1218
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:29,723
And then the third tile is Pericles.
He lived from 495 to 429.

1219
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:32,309
None of the puzzles make sense.
We're missing something!

1220
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:33,769
Ben, hang on.

1221
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:36,688
Zoey, what are you doing? Talk to me.

1222
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:38,690
"You'll never be able to solve it alone."

1223
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:41,860
You can't do it on your own.
And you're stuck in a box.

1224
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:44,154
Why would he do that?
Just to taunt you?

1225
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:47,241
Doors of perception.
If you can't see, then change the view.

1226
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:50,160
We don't have time.
My dad is gonna be here any minute now.

1227
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:54,915
What are you doing? Talk to me.
We can work this together.

1228
01:21:57,543 --> 01:22:00,712
Doors of perception.
If you can't see, change the view.

1229
01:22:01,713 --> 01:22:02,756
What are you looking at?

1230
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:06,343
- What do you see?
- It's a lenticular hologram.

1231
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:08,262
- What?
- I can see what you can't see.

1232
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:10,848
That's why you'll
never be able to solve it on your own!

1233
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:13,016
- What are they?
- There are three images.

1234
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,601
The first one's a pentagram,

1235
01:22:14,685 --> 01:22:16,895
the second is a cross section
of a nautilus shell,

1236
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,690
and the third one is a DNA molecule.

1237
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:21,567
Maybe it's Fibonacci's sequence?

1238
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:24,403
No, the golden ratio exists
with all three of those images.

1239
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:27,614
- Wait, so, what? So 1.6?
- 1.618!

1240
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:31,743
Shit!

1241
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:39,626
The golden ratio is represented
by the Greek letter phi, right?

1242
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:40,627
Yeah.

1243
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:45,174
- But how does that correspond to this?
- Lowercase!

1244
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:48,260
All of the tiles are in lowercase,
so the symbol for phi is...

1245
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:53,140
- I've got it. I got it!
- Okay.

1246
01:22:58,770 --> 01:22:59,813
It worked.

1247
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:12,326
Are you okay?

1248
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:14,119
I'm not going back in there.

1249
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:16,371
Don't do this, Claire.

1250
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:22,920
You have any idea
what you have just done?

1251
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:26,507
How could you do this to me?

1252
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:33,388
After everything I have done for you.

1253
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:47,277
You let me out of here right now.

1254
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:51,240
- Claire.
- Ben.

1255
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:53,575
Claire?

1256
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,454
Claire!

1257
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:07,673
Zoey, hurry! This way.

1258
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:10,050
Zero, five, two, six.

1259
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:18,892
Zoey.

1260
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:22,855
Can you get him out?

1261
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:24,273
- I'm trying.
- Get him out.

1262
01:24:24,356 --> 01:24:25,732
There's just too much root code.

1263
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:28,193
I have to override the entire thing.

1264
01:24:28,277 --> 01:24:30,737
He's not gonna make it much longer.
You have to hurry up.

1265
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:32,781
I think I got it.

1266
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:42,791
Thank you.

1267
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:47,671
After you escaped,
the clients begged for an encore.

1268
01:24:47,754 --> 01:24:49,840
A game of champions.

1269
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:51,466
We started letting people win.

1270
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,927
You're the only one
who ever really beat them.

1271
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,184
- Where's Ben?
- You already know.

1272
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:03,061
The coordinates. You were right all along.

1273
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:05,355
You know where the building is. Here.

1274
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:07,983
Take my dad's car.
It's not like he can stop you.

1275
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:10,194
What are you gonna do to him?

1276
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:12,988
As soon as I get far enough away,
I'm gonna call the police.

1277
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:14,239
He'll pay for what he did.

1278
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:18,994
You know they're still out there,
though, right? They can hunt you.

1279
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,996
You came here for proof, right?

1280
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:24,708
<i>So I might have locked some doors.</i>

1281
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:26,502
- Sir!
- Have you checked the network?

1282
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:31,507
Made it a little more difficult
for them to clean up their mess this time.

1283
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:44,728
Thank you.

1284
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,228
Ben?

1285
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:28,313
Hey, hey, hey, miss. You can't...

1286
01:26:28,397 --> 01:26:29,690
- Miss, stop!
- Ben.

1287
01:26:30,524 --> 01:26:32,401
Ben? Ben!

1288
01:26:33,527 --> 01:26:35,070
- Ben.
- Zoey?

1289
01:26:35,153 --> 01:26:38,699
Hey, hey, hey. She's with me.
Just give us a minute, okay?

1290
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:41,201
Are you okay?

1291
01:26:41,827 --> 01:26:45,581
When I went through the sand,
there was a guy waiting.

1292
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:49,918
And he gave me this.

1293
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:52,421
I don't know if it's a threat or...

1294
01:26:55,007 --> 01:26:56,550
I think it's a "thank you."

1295
01:27:04,558 --> 01:27:05,434
It's over.

1296
01:27:06,185 --> 01:27:07,394
We're safe now, Ben.

1297
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:09,730
Yeah.

1298
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:12,191
It's over.

1299
01:27:40,552 --> 01:27:42,638
I only ever wanted to protect you.

1300
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:46,058
You stole everything from me.

1301
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:49,728
There was a time when
I could've said the same thing to you.

1302
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:52,564
You know that I lost Mother
long before that day.

1303
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:56,360
I knew she was reaching her end,
that she was making plans.

1304
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:58,737
<i>So I decided to test her.</i>

1305
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,614
Claire. You're hurting me.

1306
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:03,283
Still, I hoped that it wasn't true.

1307
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:06,578
<i>I hoped that my own mother
could love me for who I really was.</i>

1308
01:28:06,662 --> 01:28:09,039
Put them back. Put them back.

1309
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:11,959
I want them all.

1310
01:28:12,626 --> 01:28:14,253
I wasn't afraid.

1311
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:19,049
<i>I followed my curiosity wherever it led,
and I was smarter than both of you.</i>

1312
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:23,428
Parents are supposed
to love their children.

1313
01:28:23,512 --> 01:28:26,348
They're not supposed
to throw them away like trash!

1314
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:27,975
Why are you crying?

1315
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:29,977
You need help, honey.

1316
01:28:30,686 --> 01:28:31,854
You can help me.

1317
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:34,314
Not in the way you need.

1318
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:36,400
You're going to go away for a while.

1319
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:40,487
I even tried to show you
how useful I could be to you

1320
01:28:40,571 --> 01:28:41,905
<i>by getting rid of her.</i>

1321
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:43,574
<i>And how did you repay me?</i>

1322
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:47,286
You stole all of my ideas.
You took all of the credit.

1323
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:48,662
Claire, calm down.

1324
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:52,040
I created such beautiful rooms for you,

1325
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:57,087
and no matter how high the profits soared,
you still censored and stifled me.

1326
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:59,882
Honey, we could be together.
We could be a team.

1327
01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:03,552
You and Mom are gonna
be so proud of me...

1328
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:07,055
when you see what I can really do.

1329
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:14,479
- <i>Incorrect.</i>
- Goodbye, Dad.

1330
01:29:14,563 --> 01:29:16,273
<i>Initiating purge.</i>

1331
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:18,192
<i>Claire!</i>
