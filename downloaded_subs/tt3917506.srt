2
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:17,518
It won't work, Ashley.

3
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:19,151
I want my present.

4
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:21,084
Your birthday's tomorrow.

5
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:25,552
I want Barella now.

6
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:39,552
There Barella, you're
almost as pretty as me.

7
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:48,484
You left Todd behind the sofa.

8
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,818
You're special.

9
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,585
I don't like him any more.

10
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,284
That's no way to treat your old
bear.

11
00:00:57,284 --> 00:00:58,719
Leave me alone!

12
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,118
Barella wants her dream house.

13
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,218
I saw you wrap it.

14
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,585
You're special.

15
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:16,718
You're special.

16
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:19,685
Special.

17
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:51,718
Todd tried to get me, Mummy.

18
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:54,251
What have I told you
about getting out of bed.

19
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:55,451
But, Mummy, Todd.

20
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:56,485
Todd what?

21
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,552
No, Mummy, don't.

22
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:02,652
Leave him alone.

23
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:05,151
Scream again, and you'll get a
smack.

24
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:06,752
Now turn the light off.

25
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,685
Can I leave the light on,
please?

26
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:11,485
Not another peep, I mean it.

27
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,451
Special.

28
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,051
Special!

29
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,451
I said, shut it!

30
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:23,285
If you want him so badly, have
him.

31
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,752
Noooo, Mummy!

32
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:27,051
Not another word.

33
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:37,183
You're special.

34
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,752
Special, special,
special, special, special.

35
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:00,218
Caught you, you little shit.

36
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,218
You're special.

37
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:38,351
I was never one of the lucky
kids,

38
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,419
the ones locked in a
cupboard under the stairs,

39
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,852
cigarettes stubbed out
on them in the dark.

40
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,552
Now I know that doesn't seem
very lucky.

41
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:48,485
But those kids, they had nothing
to lose.

42
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:51,385
No happy family, no toys and
games.

43
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,251
They certainly didn't
have a bear like Benny.

44
00:05:57,818 --> 00:06:00,419
My story begins when I turned
35,

45
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:02,585
the year Toy Box sold record
units

46
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,852
of the state-of-the-art Rosko.

47
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:07,184
Its creator made designer of the
year.

48
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,219
But neither were mine.

49
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:13,118
Ushering in a new era in Toy
Box's future,

50
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,083
give it up for Richard.

51
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:18,184
That's my competition
for creative director,

52
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,685
brown-nosing Ron, my
boss, who has a stutter,

53
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:22,385
but only on F words.

54
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,552
These fakes pretend to like him,

55
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,251
but we all know he's a galactic
tit.

56
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,285
It's Reshard, actually.

57
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,151
Reshard.

58
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,151
Tit.

59
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:40,818
Deep underground.

60
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,752
A new breed of machine.

61
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,285
Uncompromising.

62
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:49,718
Devastating.

63
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:54,518
Disco.

64
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:59,083
Dancing disco AIDS.

65
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,351
♪ Aids ♪

66
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:03,652
Yeah, okay, that's my toy,

67
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:05,285
but in fairness.

68
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,418
It's meant to say RAID,

69
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:12,151
Robot Artificial Intelligent
Disco System.

70
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:16,319
Now I bet we're all wondering,

71
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,518
who wants to give their
children AIDS for Christmas?

72
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:23,685
I had a date

73
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,351
with the stunningly bland Tara.

74
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,051
Just you wait, babes.

75
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:55,151
Shut up!

76
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,151
Babes, who was that?

77
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,285
Sorry, Mum.

78
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,485
You live with your
fucking parents, babes.

79
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:02,784
Ah, I forget to mention,

80
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:05,518
I still live with my fucking
parents.

81
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,552
Open your card, it's funny.

82
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:09,752
You laughed at ET.

83
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,318
Well only the ending.

84
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:12,451
I don't wanna a huge number

85
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:14,351
reminding me of how old I am.

86
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,718
Aww. Have a cupper, love.

87
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:18,318
40? I'm only 35.

88
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:20,251
And now you feel better about
it.

89
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,285
Oi, how would you like to be put

90
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:24,351
on spin with dad's skid marks?

91
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:25,385
Benny loves you.

92
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,451
Why don't you help me
put the shelf up today?

93
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,784
Because it's not your birthday.

94
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:30,318
You're gonna have to learn this
stuff

95
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:31,418
if you're getting your own
place.

96
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:32,652
Who said anything about that?

97
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:33,852
Oh I did think about getting

98
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:37,351
my only place, but, cake?

99
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,552
Every year, Mum and Dad

100
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,618
would plan a special
birthday surprise party,

101
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:43,852
which by the time you're 35,

102
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:46,051
isn't much of a surprise
anymore.

103
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:12,051
Ohhhh.

104
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,684
Mum, could I have a?

105
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,151
Mum?

106
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,385
Dad?

107
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,251
Mum?

108
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:28,552
Mum say something.

109
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,652
My 35th birthday,

110
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:41,684
the day I finally got my own
place.

111
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,285
Jack.

112
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,552
The company
want foreclosure on the loan,

113
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,184
repossess your house.

114
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:01,351
No you can't, I'll get on top of
this.

115
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:04,684
Ah, ah, I managed to talk
them out of that, just.

116
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:08,385
I've convinced them to
restructure the loan,

117
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:10,218
into smaller payments.

118
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,084
Good.

119
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,818
This says I'll pay back three
times as much.

120
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:17,718
Four.

121
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,485
You should be thanking me.

122
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,119
Your ads says
the best rates in town.

123
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:22,818
Oh they are.

124
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:24,584
Just not this town.

125
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,084
I just need time.

126
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,784
That promotion-

127
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,385
Has nothing to do with the loan.

128
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:35,119
Listen, if I were you, I would

129
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,184
sell the house, problem solved.

130
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:39,684
This is my home.

131
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:42,151
Not if you don't sign.

132
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,218
That is my favourite
pen, if you don't mind.

133
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:06,752
Scum.

134
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:12,652
Excellent, now I do have to
inform you

135
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,784
that if we don't receive
payment by the end of the week,

136
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:17,518
the company will have to start
the repossession procedure.

137
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:20,952
Biscuit.

138
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:24,151
Oh yes, don't mind if I do.

139
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,151
I wish I could put in the hours.

140
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:06,684
But with a family, it's just not
possible.

141
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,084
Then why are you here?

142
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,151
Told the wife I was working
late.

143
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,118
Working late.

144
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:14,251
But really, I'm off
to the Prince concert.

145
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:15,552
Fuck off.

146
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,285
No, really, Prince is back.

147
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,584
No, really, fuck off, I'm
working.

148
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:20,784
I'm celebrating.

149
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,218
Come on lets bury
the hatchet.

150
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:25,184
No one's going to get promoted,
by being wasted Richard.

151
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:27,318
God I hate people who
pronounce it Richard.

152
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:28,451
You're not even French.

153
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,718
So, no one calls Ralph Feinnes,
Ralf.

154
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,484
Because he's Welsh.

155
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,451
God I'd hate to be Welsh.

156
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,718
Just go, I have to get this
finished.

157
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,151
Lots of people are saying
you're already finished.

158
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:41,552
Who's saying that?

159
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,218
People.

160
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:45,218
Lots of them.

161
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:46,451
Jack?

162
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:50,118
I suppose you're wondering
why Ron's here so late?

163
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:52,751
He's here to tell you the good
news.

164
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,285
Good news.

165
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:55,751
About the promotion.

166
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:57,552
No?

167
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:58,418
Mmm.

168
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:01,484
About the promotion.

169
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,518
Jack.

170
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:21,184
Jack?

171
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:52,651
Hmmm.

172
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,318
Precious!

173
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:05,251
Jack!

174
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:09,584
Sweetums.

175
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,684
Come to daddy.

176
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,251
Who's a good boy?

177
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:17,719
Jack?

178
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,651
Come on!

179
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:22,051
Who's a good doggy?

180
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,584
Doors opening.

181
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,418
Jesus!

182
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,384
Prince actually.

183
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,284
But close enough.

184
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:32,418
Hmmm.

185
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,752
Here's the thing.

186
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:54,351
I'm letting you go.

187
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:55,084
What?

188
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,752
I can't send my creative
director

189
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,518
to New York in a Goonies
T-shirt.

190
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:03,251
I don't have a Goonies
T-shirt, I have a Gremlins one.

191
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:05,318
I don't give a fuck about the
Goonies.

192
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:06,852
Me neither, you keep
going on about them.

193
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,484
Or Gremlins!

194
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:11,618
Young people today
aren't playing Simon Says

195
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:14,251
in f-f-f-fucking fingerless
f-f-f-fucking gloves

196
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:17,184
and shoulder pads, it's all
smart phones

197
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:18,518
and blue movie players.

198
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,284
Blu-Ray, sir, look, my designs...

199
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:23,251
You haven't evolved.

200
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:25,619
Richard's edgy, stands up for
himself.

201
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,284
Okay, I am not gonna stand
here...

202
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,351
Sit.

203
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,719
It's just business, sorry.

204
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:34,251
Please, sir.

205
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,551
Hmmm.

206
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,251
There is a junior design
position,

207
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,584
two-thirds your salary.

208
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:45,318
Best I can do.

209
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:48,418
Sir, I can't afford a pay cut.

210
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,585
I'm offering to help.

211
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:57,284
Do you want my help or not?

212
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:01,318
Yes sir.

213
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:03,418
Great, welcome to the team.

214
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:05,318
You're on probation, so
I want something fresh

215
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:08,451
by Friday or you're out, again.

216
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,218
Oh, and smile.

217
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,652
You always look so bloody
miserable,

218
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:17,051
plodding around like someone
died.

219
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:18,919
Sir?

220
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:21,051
I just gave you a job.

221
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,184
Give me a smile.

222
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:24,418
Come on!

223
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,318
Good boy.

224
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,218
Are you a loser or a winner?

225
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:46,084
If you bought this tape, you're
a loser.

226
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:48,552
Look in the mirror and tell
yourself.

227
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:50,183
You're a fucking winner.

228
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:54,785
Yes, I'm in the area
with a buyer on Monday.

229
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:58,251
Should be able to swing by then.

230
00:16:58,818 --> 00:16:59,818
It's quite big isn't it?

231
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:02,785
Must get quite lonely.

232
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:05,218
It's more of a family home.

233
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,852
Do not fear change, embrace it.

234
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:23,719
Take your failed,
pathetic life and bin it.

235
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,685
Become someone greater.

236
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:29,251
Cheeky, we'll find you a new
home.

237
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:32,351
One by one, you'll feel the old
you dissolve

238
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,251
away, leaving an uncompromising
winner in its wake.

239
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:48,685
Benny loves you.

240
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:54,251
More. Weeeee.

241
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:57,652
Goodnight, my special boy.

242
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,183
Jaaaaaaack.

243
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:24,051
Jaaaaaaaaaaaaack.

244
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:26,785
Jaaaaaaack.

245
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:35,785
Mum, mum!

246
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,118
Jack!

247
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:41,419
Mum!

248
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:47,151
Leave the light on, please.

249
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:48,083
Wait there.

250
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,785
Cuddle Benny.

251
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,351
Ta-da.

252
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:56,384
I was gonna save him for you,

253
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:59,019
but this, this is Benny.

254
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,785
Made just for you.

255
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:03,652
With one mission, to keep you
safe.

256
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,718
As long as you have him by your
side,

257
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:07,585
nothing can ever hurt you.

258
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:10,183
Not even the demons in the
hallway?

259
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,384
Apart from them!

260
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,351
No, silly, not even the
demons in the hallway.

261
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:19,083
Benny loves you.

262
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:19,785
Come on, boy.

263
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:24,818
Oh wow, cuddle Benny, more.

264
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:28,118
We'll be friends forever and
ever.

265
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,218
Benny loves you.

266
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:40,652
Play with Benny.

267
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,585
It's time to let go of the
past.

268
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,251
Weeeeeeee.

269
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:51,251
Cleanse yourself.

270
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:56,118
You are not defined by
your former mistakes.

271
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:59,585
But prepared by them to tackle
the future.

272
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,151
Your life cannot change until
you do.

273
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,251
Play with Benny.

274
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,618
Press my tummy to make me laugh.

275
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:31,251
Press my tummy to make meeee
laaaaaaugh.

276
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,784
Cuddle me.

277
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:42,285
Play with Benny.

278
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:04,285
Cheeeeekyyyyyy.

279
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:06,852
999, please state the emergency

280
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,418
service you require.

281
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:11,518
Oh, God, someone
murdered all my teddies.

282
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:12,652
Sorry?

283
00:24:13,818 --> 00:24:16,351
Calm down, sir, there's no harm
done.

284
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:18,652
All the doors were locked.

285
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,818
Suggesting the intruder had a
key.

286
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:23,151
It's normally someone you know.

287
00:24:23,184 --> 00:24:24,285
It's Benny.

288
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,585
Someone jealous.

289
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:26,618
Do you have an ex-wife?

290
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:27,184
No.

291
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,351
Anyone staying with you?

292
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,219
No.

293
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:29,852
Relatives?

294
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:30,585
No.

295
00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:31,219
A girlfriend?

296
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:31,718
No.

297
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:32,418
Friends?

298
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,119
A pet?

299
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:34,351
No. No. Ok, there's no one else.

300
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,184
I'm a complete loner all right.

301
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:37,818
Good!

302
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,351
Complete. Loser.

303
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:42,552
Loner!

304
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,752
Yes, of course, sorry.

305
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,652
What about biscuits?

306
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:49,718
For DNA?

307
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:51,119
No.

308
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,151
For my tea.

309
00:24:58,451 --> 00:24:59,618
Custard creams.

310
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:01,784
I love custard creams.

311
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:02,684
Ohhhhh.

312
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:13,485
How many teddies were involved
in this massacre then?

313
00:25:13,518 --> 00:25:14,518
I don't know.

314
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:16,084
All their heads are gone.

315
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,652
They're still here, just
gotta match them up like socks.

316
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:21,784
Don't I get some protection?

317
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:23,818
Where's Benny?

318
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:24,752
Who's Benny?

319
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:26,451
My teddy bear.

320
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,818
What, two megabytes of
level two cache memory?

321
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:39,518
No, that's not good enough,
Rupert.

322
00:25:39,552 --> 00:25:41,119
It's caché memory.

323
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:41,919
Say it.

324
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:43,852
I just wanna give it a little,
uh,

325
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:45,752
just a little je ne sais quoi,
you know.

326
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:46,585
Boo!

327
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:49,051
Joie de vivre.

328
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:50,718
Some bon viveur.

329
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:53,184
Crème de la crme.

330
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,684
Ok, you know what, Bon Voyage.

331
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:58,351
The Secret to Award-Winning
Success.

332
00:25:59,151 --> 00:25:59,818
For Losers.

333
00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:02,518
Well, they ran out of Dummies.

334
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:04,451
You've left the price tag on
your suit.

335
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:07,219
Hey, uh.

336
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:12,184
You're not gonna win
any awards for this.

337
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,485
It's F-Friday.

338
00:26:15,485 --> 00:26:16,518
Yeah.

339
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:18,584
The thing is, sir, I haven't...

340
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,584
I took his designs home to
cost spec, so it's my fault.

341
00:26:21,618 --> 00:26:24,219
Already have our new tech lady
on it.

342
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,718
First thing Monday.

343
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,684
Senior Product Engineer please.

344
00:26:28,718 --> 00:26:32,285
If you need voice control,
motion sensors,

345
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:38,318
proximity triggers, or even
level two cache, I'm your lady.

346
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:40,652
Well, I'm no lady.

347
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,184
You provide the toys,
I provide the back end.

348
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:46,451
Dawn.

349
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:53,518
Now, finally,
you're on the road to success.

350
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:57,351
Hey, this is David from Bay...

351
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:58,151
Message deleted.

352
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,584
Hey, this is David again.
Deleted.

353
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,684
Jack, we still haven't
received the first payment.

354
00:27:02,718 --> 00:27:03,485
Deleted.

355
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:05,752
Hey, this is David again.

356
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:07,684
Come on, Jack.

00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:11,552
Jackie, Jackie.

359
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,752
Now, Jack, this is your final...

360
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:15,251
Deleted.

361
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:27,218
Play with me.

362
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:56,684
Come on.

363
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:00,584
You can do this.

364
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:03,051
[Piss]

365
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:26,684
Benny loves you.

366
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:33,184
Cuddle me.

367
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:46,184
Ta-da.

368
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:12,118
Weeeeeee.

369
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:54,719
Officers.

370
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:56,218
Can we come in?

371
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:58,084
We left our camera.

372
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,151
Wait there, I'll just get it.

373
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,719
No, uh, actually, we've
got a few more questions

374
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:06,484
to ask about the break-in,
if you don't mind, sir.

375
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:07,484
Just let me change.

376
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:10,685
Shit.

377
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:15,785
Mr Hunt.

378
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:20,819
What is he doing?

379
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,551
Come on, Jack, we know you're in
there.

380
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:28,752
Why would he run away?

381
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:30,151
There's a door there.

382
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:31,218
Let's go round the back.

383
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:35,685
He just shut the door.

384
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:46,518
Mr. Hunt, just, Mr. Hunt, open
the door.

385
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:50,384
What's that?

386
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:55,351
Come in.

387
00:32:55,384 --> 00:32:56,785
Oh, come on.

388
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:11,118
That's new.

389
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:16,685
I like it.

390
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:20,585
Modern art, exploding from
the boundaries of the canvas.

391
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:22,318
Do you recognise this man?

392
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:27,318
He's

393
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,183
unrecognisable.

394
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,151
Your account manager at
Bayvista?

395
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:34,619
Oh, I recognise him.

396
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:38,183
I just thought you meant,
you know, recently.

397
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,552
He was booked to visit you
yesterday.

398
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:43,183
He's not here.

399
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,218
Maybe he's ill.

400
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:45,351
That was our thoughts,

401
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:48,251
until we found his car parked
at the end of your road.

402
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,051
How odd.

403
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:54,218
Can I borrow a pen?

404
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:55,785
I'll give it back.

405
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:58,251
Am I under any suspicion here?

406
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,118
We thought there could be
a connection to the break-in.

407
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:02,118
You're fine.

408
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:05,284
Unless we find his body.

409
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:21,719
Is there something you wanna
tell us?

410
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,151
No.

411
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:39,351
Just, just hope he's okay,
that's all.

412
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:40,619
It's probably nothing.

413
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:45,084
Hang on.

414
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,785
It's not the same.

415
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:52,418
Without custard creams.

416
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:56,351
Now which cupboard are they?

417
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:03,384
No, no biscuits.

418
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:04,718
Really?

419
00:35:10,284 --> 00:35:12,718
They were cheap ones anyway.

420
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:14,752
Leave it, Sarge.

421
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:16,384
It's not worth it.

422
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:23,485
Oh, you found your bear then?

423
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:37,183
Oh my God.

424
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,652
Benny loves you.

425
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:48,585
Fuck!

426
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:57,351
Benny?

427
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:16,785
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

428
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,284
Cuddle me.

429
00:36:22,718 --> 00:36:24,218
Weeeeeeeee.

430
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:25,718
Benny loves you.

431
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:26,652
Okay.

432
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,218
Play with Benny.

433
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:29,318
Oh wow.

434
00:36:29,351 --> 00:36:30,083
All right.

435
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,852
More, more, more.

436
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:32,685
Okay.

437
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:33,519
Oh wow.

438
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:34,385
Okay, enough.

439
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:36,083
More, more.

440
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:38,718
Weeeeeeeeeee!

441
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:39,618
No way.

442
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:42,118
It's Benny.

443
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:45,251
Play with Benny.

444
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:00,685
Oh fuck, I need a beer.

445
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,183
Okey dokey.

446
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:05,284
Benny loves you, Benny
loves you.

447
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:07,785
Play with Benny.

448
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:15,652
Why did you kill him?

449
00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:18,183
Benny loves you.

450
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,519
Okay, for the moment, you can
stay here.

451
00:37:23,552 --> 00:37:25,183
Weeeeeeeeee!

452
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:27,083
Under the conditions no one else
dies,

453
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:30,718
stay completely out of sight,
no one can know you're here.

454
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,752
Just until I figure out what to
do.

455
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:34,618
Okey dokey.

456
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,585
My house, my rules.

457
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:39,552
Look, we can't just kill
people we don't like, okay?

458
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,618
You have to promise.

459
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:43,785
Are you listening?

460
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:45,183
Say okey dokey.

461
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:46,485
Okey dokey.

462
00:37:46,818 --> 00:37:48,351
Cuddle Benny.

463
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:49,319
Later.

464
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:53,685
Weeeeeeeeeeee!

465
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:05,485
Shit!

466
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,718
Calm down, Benny.

467
00:38:10,485 --> 00:38:11,585
Oi.

468
00:38:11,618 --> 00:38:13,785
Look, it's really nice to
have you around and that,

469
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:15,785
but, sit.

470
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,518
And put that knife down.

471
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:22,083
Good boy.

472
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:53,685
Cuddly robotic killers.

473
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:54,818
A whole universe.

474
00:38:54,852 --> 00:38:57,118
They've got different
personalities, weapons, outfits.

475
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:58,552
They can talk to each other,
interact.

476
00:38:58,585 --> 00:38:59,585
They can even fight.

477
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:02,118
This could be huge.

478
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:03,618
Huge.

479
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:07,451
Have you had a brain
haemorrhage?

480
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:09,183
Think young adults, collectors,

481
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:10,852
teenagers, horror fans, comic
fans.

482
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:12,652
Losers, virgins, chumps.

483
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,552
There's a huge market out there.

484
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,685
Let me create toys for a new
demographic.

485
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:17,618
Loser.

486
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:18,451
As the new creative director,

487
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:19,652
I'm not gonna allow this project
to...

488
00:39:19,685 --> 00:39:23,151
Sorry, did I say that you
were the new creative director?

489
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:25,118
Yeah, well, you fired
him, so, here I am.

490
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:30,118
Did I say that you were
the new creative director?

491
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,585
99%, yeah.

492
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:36,118
Did I say

493
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,652
that you

494
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:39,351
were the new

495
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:40,818
creative

496
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:42,184
director?

497
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,518
99%.

498
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:47,219
Well you didn't use that
exact specific sentence,

499
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,618
but just juggle some of
the words around, and, yes.

500
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:51,784
Yes.

501
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:56,351
No.

502
00:39:56,385 --> 00:39:57,184
No.

503
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:59,585
Let's see where this goes, shall
we?

504
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:29,285
Hold it there. Hold. Hold.

505
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:26,285
Aren't you beautiful, yes-

506
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:27,518
No!

507
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:03,752
High-five.

508
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:16,451
You're good.

509
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:18,684
I've got thousands of
motion-capture files,

510
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:21,385
and I can upload them all with
this.

511
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:24,585
Milk, milk, lemonade,

512
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:26,485
round the corner, chocolate's
made.

513
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,385
How about tonight we go
shoot some pool and grab

514
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:32,852
some burgers and mow some
old ladies down on the pier?

515
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,119
Grand Theft Auto.

516
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,119
I'd love to, but I've got
market research, profit ratios.

517
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:40,219
What are you afraid of?

518
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:43,818
Benny loves you.

519
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,318
Don't ring me at work.

520
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:47,485
Mmm.

521
00:42:47,518 --> 00:42:50,418
I want you to pitch that to
the New York team next week.

522
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,552
Oh, and I'm taking me grandkids

523
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:53,818
to the theatre Saturday night.

524
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:56,084
So can you look after me lovely
Precious?

525
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,351
Oh, that's really not...

526
00:42:57,385 --> 00:42:58,684
Fine, Richard said he could...

527
00:42:58,718 --> 00:43:00,552
Not really a problem, sir.

528
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:02,485
I'll drop her off at 7:30.

529
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:05,251
Saturday, your place.

530
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:06,752
You cook.

531
00:43:13,518 --> 00:43:14,652
I knew it.

532
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,318
I've been here before.

533
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:20,385
I had a date with this creep,
babes.

534
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:23,119
Oh you mean, um, Jack.

535
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:25,684
Yeah, well don't worry,
you're with me now.

536
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:29,119
There's nothing to be afraid of
here.

537
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:34,084
Oh dear.

538
00:43:35,218 --> 00:43:36,285
Cheap.

539
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:40,385
This, um,

540
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:46,618
airing cupboard is lovely and
cosy.

541
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,119
Cosy?

542
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:49,818
I'm not getting in it, babes.

543
00:43:52,285 --> 00:43:53,285
No, of course not.

544
00:43:55,485 --> 00:43:56,818
Right.

545
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:05,251
[Get out babes]

546
00:44:06,752 --> 00:44:10,351
See here, he's transformed
this seemingly blank canvas

547
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:13,151
into a rather stunning feature
wall,

548
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:16,251
which I'm sure you'll agree
really brings the room together.

549
00:44:17,484 --> 00:44:19,351
Can I just. Get out of my way.
Please.

550
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:21,385
Anythink you'd like.
Everything's for sale!

551
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:44,051
Benny loves you.

552
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:45,552
It's Benny.

553
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,218
Weeeeeeeeee!

554
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:43,351
Huh?

555
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:10,118
Benny loves you.

556
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:11,418

What the fuck is your problem?

742
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:51,318
Ron fired me because of you.

743
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:52,385
Benny loves you.

744
00:58:52,418 --> 00:58:55,084
Yeah? Then do one thing for me.

745
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,684
Go back to the way you were.

746
00:58:57,485 --> 00:58:59,518
A stuffed, lifeless toy.

747
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:11,585
Ta-da.

748
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:14,584
Forget it.

749
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:27,418
Play with me.

750
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:29,652
Fuck off, Benny.

751
00:59:35,718 --> 00:59:37,184
Shitbag.

752
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,518
Benny, come on.

753
00:59:57,584 --> 00:59:59,184
Ta-da.

754
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:12,119
Ron!

755
01:00:14,518 --> 01:00:16,084
Are you insane?

756
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:17,784
I'm so sorry sir, it wasn't me.

757
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:18,752
Then who was it?

758
01:00:18,784 --> 01:00:19,784
How did you even get...

759
01:00:19,818 --> 01:00:21,851
Someone hit me over the head.

760
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:25,818
Then I woke, tied to this
f-fucking chair.

761
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:27,285
You've lost it.

762
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:28,618
This is the end of you, the end.

763
01:00:28,652 --> 01:00:29,718
But it wasn't me.

764
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:31,752
You wait till the police
hear about this, you maniac.

765
01:00:31,784 --> 01:00:33,518
Look. Let's not do anything we
might regret.

766
01:00:33,552 --> 01:00:35,485
Let's just think about this.

767
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,184
Untie me, you f-f-fucking idiot.

768
01:00:41,218 --> 01:00:42,518
Yes, sir, I'm sorry sir.

769
01:00:43,784 --> 01:00:45,251
There's a good boy.

770
01:00:49,218 --> 01:00:50,084
What?

771
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,518
I said, hurry up, come on.

772
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:55,784
No, you said good boy.

773
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,251
So what?

774
01:01:00,385 --> 01:01:01,552
What are you playing at?

775
01:01:01,752 --> 01:01:04,184
You've never really understood

776
01:01:04,218 --> 01:01:05,351
what I'm capable of.

777
01:01:05,385 --> 01:01:07,752
After my Precious, I'm very well
aware.

778
01:01:09,552 --> 01:01:10,818
Precious got it easy,

779
01:01:11,618 --> 01:01:13,784
and you're in no position to
negotiate.

780
01:01:17,885 --> 01:01:19,184
What do you want?

781
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:22,618
Hmm, let's say I hang on to this
photo,

782
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,584
you give me that promotion.

783
01:01:26,385 --> 01:01:28,285
Double my salary.

784
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:32,584
And we never speak of this
again.

785
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,351
It's just business.

786
01:01:35,652 --> 01:01:36,784
You're joking?

787
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,285
Am I?

788
01:01:38,752 --> 01:01:40,318
Nothing to lose.

789
01:01:42,818 --> 01:01:45,718
Okay, whatever
you want, just untie me.

790
01:01:49,784 --> 01:01:51,184
Then give me a smile.

791
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,518
What?

792
01:01:54,552 --> 01:01:55,652
Give

793
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:57,151
me

794
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:58,218
a smile.

795
01:02:07,784 --> 01:02:09,084
Good boy.

796
01:02:09,985 --> 01:02:15,118
Now tell me I'm a fucking
fabulous first-rate designer.

797
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:16,451
Look, this isn't necessary.

798
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,051
Say it, bitch.

799
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:24,318
You're a f-f-f-f-f-fucking
f-f-f-f-fabulous

800
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:28,718
f-f-first rate f-f-f-f-fucking
designer.

801
01:02:29,118 --> 01:02:33,218
Now tell me you love being my
bitch.

802
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:37,718
I love being your bitch.

803
01:02:42,518 --> 01:02:43,151
No.

804
01:02:46,751 --> 01:02:47,451
No!

805
01:03:20,718 --> 01:03:22,184
Ta-da.

806
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:30,618
This

807
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:33,384
is not

808
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:36,151
a present.

809
01:03:39,418 --> 01:03:41,184
Benny loves you.

810
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,084
Yeah?

811
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:45,285
Well Jack hates you.

812
01:03:53,218 --> 01:03:54,351
Cuddle me.

813
01:03:58,384 --> 01:03:59,719
Benny loves you.

814
01:04:08,651 --> 01:04:09,819
You're a winner.

815
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:14,384
You're a winner.

816
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:18,651
You're a winner.

817
01:04:21,752 --> 01:04:23,318
You're a winner.

818
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:27,618
You're a winner.

819
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:42,251
You're a loser.

820
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:49,318
Listen, I've just...

821
01:04:54,351 --> 01:04:56,218
You're wearing a party hat.

822
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,218
It's my birthday.

823
01:04:58,584 --> 01:04:59,451
Was.

824
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:01,184
I'm cleaning.

825
01:05:01,218 --> 01:05:02,852
Okay, weird.

826
01:05:02,885 --> 01:05:04,351
I've come to pick up the
prototype.

827
01:05:04,384 --> 01:05:05,752
Otherwise, they're gonna fire me
too.

828
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:06,852
It's not what you think it was.

829
01:05:06,885 --> 01:05:07,852
I don't wanna talk about it.

830
01:05:07,885 --> 01:05:09,151
I protected you.

831
01:05:09,184 --> 01:05:10,852
From a pug?

832
01:05:10,885 --> 01:05:12,384
I think it had rabies.

833
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:16,685
In everything that's happened,

834
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:20,251
the one thing I don't
regret is meeting you.

835
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:25,484
Whatever anyone says,
whatever you hear about me,

836
01:05:26,852 --> 01:05:28,351
I'm not Norman Bates, okay?

837
01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:30,118
Good.

838
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,251
I can't bear cross-dressers.

839
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:38,484
Friends?

840
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,284
I should go.

841
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:50,184
Stay.

842
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:52,752
And do what?

843
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:10,719
Cleaning up dog remains.

844
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:12,752
This is not Grand Theft Auto.

845
01:06:14,451 --> 01:06:16,284
You really know how to treat a
lady.

846
01:06:17,418 --> 01:06:19,151
You're not a lady.

847
01:08:21,318 --> 01:08:22,151
Dawn?

848
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:43,451
Shit.

849
01:08:51,785 --> 01:08:53,718
Cuddle Benny.

850
01:08:58,519 --> 01:08:59,685
Good job.

851
01:09:00,885 --> 01:09:02,284
How did you convince him?

852
01:09:04,118 --> 01:09:05,384
I didn't.

853
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,451
Benny loves you.

854
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:26,385
Play with Benny.

855
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:31,718
Let's cut it open.

856
01:09:33,818 --> 01:09:35,251
Get away from him!

857
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:39,852
She's not my type.

858
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:42,083
The bear, he'll kill you all.

859
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:49,083
Poor Jack.

860
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:51,318
He's just a teddy.

861
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:53,083
He's alive.

862
01:09:53,818 --> 01:09:54,785
Ah.

863
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,318
Come on, Benny, Jack's here.

864
01:09:59,118 --> 01:10:00,318
He's playing dead.

865
01:10:00,618 --> 01:10:01,485
Come on Benny.

866
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:04,652
He's upset because I buried him
alive.

867
01:10:04,919 --> 01:10:06,585
Well you deserved that.

868
01:10:06,618 --> 01:10:08,318
Now I bet we're all wondering.

869
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:20,552
Richard, have I ever told you

870
01:10:21,419 --> 01:10:22,652
how much I love you?

871
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,485
Aw, well, thanks, Jack.

872
01:10:37,485 --> 01:10:39,051
Benny loves you.

873
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:42,118
If you want her, you've
gotta go through me.

874
01:10:43,183 --> 01:10:44,183
Or Richard.

875
01:10:44,218 --> 01:10:44,785
What?

876
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,319
It's Benny.

877
01:10:56,884 --> 01:10:58,151
Cuddle me.

878
01:11:04,285 --> 01:11:04,752
My car.

879
01:11:04,785 --> 01:11:05,618
My car.

880
01:11:05,652 --> 01:11:07,319
Two-seaters are fucking death
traps.

881
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:09,183
Give me the keys, you can't
drive.

882
01:11:12,818 --> 01:11:14,785
Mirror, signal...

883
01:11:14,818 --> 01:11:16,519
Manoeuvre, Jack, fucking
manoeuvre.

884
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:17,451
I can't drive.

885
01:11:17,485 --> 01:11:18,385
Move!

886
01:11:23,685 --> 01:11:25,618
Be careful with her.

887
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:27,419
She's the most beautiful
girl in the world.

888
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:28,451
Let's go.

889
01:11:47,285 --> 01:11:48,151
Cuddle me.

890
01:11:59,151 --> 01:11:59,818
Weeeee.

891
01:12:08,785 --> 01:12:10,251
Ta-da.

892
01:12:26,419 --> 01:12:28,183
Could it be a midget in a
costume?

893
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:31,385
Toys don't come to life
when you treat them like shit.

894
01:12:31,419 --> 01:12:33,118
They don't come to life at all,
in fact.

895
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:34,419
We should go to the police.

896
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:35,585
The staff were witnesses.

897
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:36,784
All dead.

898
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:40,351
I should know, I've got three
bodies in my back garden.

899
01:12:40,385 --> 01:12:41,818
Three?

900
01:12:41,852 --> 01:12:43,150
Five.

901
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:44,552
If you count pets.

902
01:12:44,585 --> 01:12:46,685
Look, he can't be bargained
with.

903
01:12:46,718 --> 01:12:48,685
He doesn't feel pity or remorse.

904
01:12:48,718 --> 01:12:50,351
He does get scared sometimes,

905
01:12:50,385 --> 01:12:53,251
but he absolutely will not stop

906
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:54,752
until you are dead.

907
01:12:56,852 --> 01:13:00,150
What's this got to do with me?

908
01:13:00,184 --> 01:13:01,051
I know.

909
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,718
Do you want another cuppa?

910
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:05,585
Go on then.

911
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:06,552
So why the hell am I here?

912
01:13:06,585 --> 01:13:08,652
Because I'm the only
person he won't kill.

913
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:09,752
I mean, go if you want.

914
01:13:09,784 --> 01:13:10,385
Laters.

915
01:13:10,418 --> 01:13:12,118
But he'll kill you anyway.

916
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:14,585
And why is that?

917
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:17,051
Because you're a tit, Richard.

918
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,385
Right, well, I'm calling the
police.

919
01:13:20,118 --> 01:13:22,151
That had all my Prince photos on
it.

920
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:23,652
Leave, and you'll end up like
Ron.

921
01:13:27,784 --> 01:13:29,351
He's one of the five.

922
01:13:29,385 --> 01:13:30,585
Why Ron?

923
01:13:30,852 --> 01:13:32,418
He loved being my bitch.

924
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,319
What is wrong with you?

925
01:13:35,351 --> 01:13:38,385
Why didn't you put him in the
fire or stab him, shoot him?

926
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:40,083
Because he's my best friend.

927
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:43,151
Don't be ridiculous, he's
trying to kill all your friends.

928
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:44,351
I don't have any other friends.

01:13:45,385 --> 01:13:46,552
Yeah, and you keep slapping me.

get anything we can to defend
ourselves.

Of course.

Why does he wanna kill me?

949
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:48,752
Is it because you think I'm a
tit?

950
01:15:48,784 --> 01:15:50,652
It's because he's jealous.

951
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:52,485
He thinks I love you more than
him.

952

Tit.

You're surrounded.

1027
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:23,419
Surrounded? Idiot.

1028
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:24,451
Then call it in.

1029
01:25:24,485 --> 01:25:26,251
We don't need armed response.

1030
01:25:27,885 --> 01:25:30,218
We need, these.

1031
01:25:30,652 --> 01:25:31,519
Pellet guns?

1032
01:25:32,485 --> 01:25:33,718
Thank God, we're saved.

1033
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:38,183
These will take down anyone at
10 paces.

1034
01:25:41,284 --> 01:25:43,752
You go in, I'll cover you.

1035
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:45,752
No, you go in, I'll cover you.

1036
01:25:45,785 --> 01:25:47,151
With what?

1037
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:47,785
My batton.

1038
01:25:48,885 --> 01:25:50,785
Take this, take it.

1039
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,318
Fine.

1040
01:25:52,351 --> 01:25:54,118
But, you go in first.

1041
01:25:54,151 --> 01:25:57,485
What? Oh fuck, all right.

1042
01:25:58,451 --> 01:25:59,685
After three.

1043
01:26:01,485 --> 01:26:02,350

1044
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:04,419
Two.

1045
01:26:05,318 --> 01:26:06,183
Three.

1046
01:26:13,685 --> 01:26:14,818
What?

1047
01:26:14,852 --> 01:26:16,118
What?

1048
01:26:16,151 --> 01:26:18,552
It's not her you're angry with,
it's me.

1049
01:26:18,585 --> 01:26:20,485
I threw you out, I ignored you.

1050
01:26:20,519 --> 01:26:23,785
I fucked up, and I'm
a dick, and I'm sorry.

1051
01:26:23,818 --> 01:26:25,318
I'm sorry for treating you,

1052
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:27,318
like a toy.

1053
01:26:28,385 --> 01:26:29,785
Where they're gonna take me,

1054
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:32,519
you won't be able to come this
time.

1055
01:26:34,652 --> 01:26:35,519
It's over.

1056
01:26:39,385 --> 01:26:40,552
Cuddle me.

1057
01:27:54,785 --> 01:27:56,118
Make a wish.

1058
01:27:58,884 --> 01:28:02,652
We'll be friends
forever and ever.

1059
01:28:12,518 --> 01:28:14,319
Jack loves you too.

1060
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:23,718
Benny, no!

1061
01:28:52,451 --> 01:28:54,385
Play with me.

1062
01:30:15,351 --> 01:30:16,418
Benny?

1063
01:30:16,451 --> 01:30:18,219
Benny looovvvees

1064
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:19,285
yooooou.

1065
01:30:19,319 --> 01:30:21,119
What the fuck was that?

1066
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:22,251
Call it in.

1067
01:30:22,285 --> 01:30:24,251
Right, you call it in.

1068
01:30:24,518 --> 01:30:25,385
Jack.

1069
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:28,184
Are you okay?

1070
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:31,351
We need an ambulance at 415 Elm
Way.

1071
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:33,485
One suspect down.

1072
01:30:33,518 --> 01:30:35,485
Male, 40, shot and wounded.

1073
01:30:35,518 --> 01:30:36,552
I'm 36.

1074
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:03,418
The sight of the
massacre where

1075
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:06,818
Reshard Williams killed his
co-workers over a lost promotion

1076
01:31:06,852 --> 01:31:09,084
will be a place of gathering for
family...

1077
01:31:10,485 --> 01:31:11,684
Last lot.

1078
01:31:11,718 --> 01:31:13,151
They're all coming with us.

1079
01:31:18,552 --> 01:31:21,119
Oi, Jack, come
here, you filthy sod.

1080
01:31:22,451 --> 01:31:24,050
My special boy.

1081
01:31:34,184 --> 01:31:34,852
Locked all the doors?

1082
01:31:34,884 --> 01:31:35,652
Check.

1083
01:31:35,684 --> 01:31:37,285
Key under the mat?

1084
01:31:37,318 --> 01:31:37,984
Check.

1085
01:31:38,019 --> 01:31:40,251
Disposed of all the evidence?

1086
01:31:40,285 --> 01:31:40,718
Oh.

1087
01:31:40,752 --> 01:31:42,051
Check.

1088
01:31:42,518 --> 01:31:43,451
Then we're golden.

1089
01:31:43,485 --> 01:31:45,618
Get out of here, before
we change our minds.

1090
01:31:48,151 --> 01:31:50,285
There goes an accessory to
murder.

1091
01:31:50,652 --> 01:31:53,385
Go ahead, tell the truth,
I'll be right behind you.

1092
01:31:54,318 --> 01:31:55,385
Pulling this face.

1093
01:31:59,418 --> 01:32:01,585
Now, I bet you're all wondering

1094
01:32:01,618 --> 01:32:03,251
how the hell we got away with
it.

1095
01:32:03,285 --> 01:32:05,318
But, the real lesson is,

1096
01:32:05,351 --> 01:32:08,151
we've all got that one special
bear,

1097
01:32:08,184 --> 01:32:10,618
someone we've cherished for
years,

1098
01:32:10,652 --> 01:32:13,385
someone that once meant the
world to us.

1099
01:32:13,418 --> 01:32:15,852
Maybe he's tattered from
years of gathering dust.

1100
01:32:15,884 --> 01:32:19,618
Maybe you've found
something else to play with.

1101
01:32:19,652 --> 01:32:23,219
But whatever you do,
under any circumstances,

1102
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:24,151
Don't.

1103
01:32:24,184 --> 01:32:24,852
Throw.

1104
01:32:24,884 --> 01:32:25,684
Him.

1105
01:32:25,718 --> 01:32:26,184
Out.

1106
01:32:26,618 --> 01:32:29,119
Or the next time you curl up to
sleep,

1107
01:32:29,151 --> 01:32:31,652
he might just come back for a
cuddle.

1108
01:32:38,518 --> 01:32:40,184
You're special.
