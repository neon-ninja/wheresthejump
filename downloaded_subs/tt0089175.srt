1
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:32,059
What was that?

2
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:36,260
Just a child of the night,
Jonathan.

3
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:41,571
Come.

4
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:44,495
Sit here beside me
on the veranda.

5
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:55,100
It's chilly out here.

6
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:59,261
Oh, no, it isn't.

7
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:00,695
It's beautiful.

8
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:04,979
I love the night so.

9
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:10,980
I've never seen you look
so beautiful before, Nina.

10
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:14,731
So pale.

11
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:16,574
So...

12
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:18,095
luminescent.

13
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:20,416
So...

14
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:21,855
Yes?

15
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:26,095
- Your lips are so red.
-Are they?

16
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:29,457
Would you like to kiss them?

17
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:45,058
Why are you looking at me
so strangely, Nina?

18
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:47,292
Not you, Jonathan.

19
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:48,735
Your neck.

20
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:54,334
Has anyone ever told you...

21
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,492
it was beautiful?

22
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,816
- No.
- Come.

23
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:04,020
Lay your head on my breast.

24
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:16,135
Stop...

25
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:18,099
you creature of the night!

26
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:26,660
Who are you who interrupts
my nightly feeding?

27
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:30,575
I... am...

28
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:32,732
Peter Vincent...

29
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:35,211
vampire killer!

30
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:43,260
Keep away!
Keep away from me!

31
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:14,256
And now your host...

32
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,173
Peter Vincent.

33
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,253
Fright Night!

34
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:20,776
This is Peter Vincent...

35
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:23,934
bringing you
Fright Night Theatre.

36
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:26,741
Charley!
Peter Vincent's on-

37
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,574
Forget Peter Vincent-

38
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,175
But you love him-

39
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:32,218
But I love you more-

40
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:39,172
Tonight's journey into horror is...

41
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,900
Blood Castle-

42
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:43,621
It will keep you
on the edge of your seat.

43
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:46,011
- Stop it-
- I know it will.

44
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:48,138
It is one of my favourites.

45
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,417
And for a very good reason.

46
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,333
I star in it.

47
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:04,173
Fright Night!

48
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:08,414
Charley, I said stop it!

49
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,614
Jesus, Amy,
give me a break!

50
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:13,858
We've been going together
almost a year-

51
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:16,331
All I ever hear is
"Charley, stop it-"

52
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:22,130
I'm sorry-

53
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:27,781
Me too-

54
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:29,853
I'm just scared, that's all-

55
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,093
Let's get into bed-

56
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,459
You mean it?

57
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,972
Charley---

58
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,256
I'm ready-

59
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,572
Amy, you're not gonna
believe this-

60
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,301
There are two guys in the yard
carrying a coffin-

61
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,811
We have pledged ourselves
to evil.

62
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,620
Sure-

63
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:39,658
And they're on the moors,
right?

64
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:42,097
- Amy, I'm serious-
- So am l-

65
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:44,173
Do you want to make love
or not?

66
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:52,298
Amy, quick, come here-
You gotta see this-

67
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:58,053
Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin---

68
00:05:58,142 --> 00:06:00,417
but I saw two guys carrying
something into that house-

69
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:01,855
I don't understand you-

70
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,740
First you want to make love,
and then you don't-

71
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,381
What's wrong?

72
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:09,490
Nothing, Mom-

73
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:10,935
Come in here, you two-

74
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,851
Are you kids having
a lovers' spat?

75
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,853
No, Mom-
Nothing like that-

76
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,092
Well, there's nothing
wrong with it-

77
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,013
The divorce rate is 76% higher---

78
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:25,662
among couples who don't argue
before marriage-

79
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:29,098
- We're in high school!
- Never hurts to plan ahead-

80
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:33,778
Amy, will you remind your mother we're
playing poker at her house this weekend?

81
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:35,659
Yes, Mrs Brewster-

82
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,055
Good night, Charley-

83
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:39,734
Yeah, good night-

84
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:43,659
- Good night, Mrs Brewster-
- Good night-

85
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:45,300
Thanks for helping
with Charley's homework-

86
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:46,781
Anytime-

87
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,735
See you tomorrow, Charley?

88
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,853
Charley, that wasn't very nice,
not walking Amy to the front door-

89
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:00,773
There are people next door-

90
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:03,171
I guess the new owner's
moving in-

91
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,253
- What new owner?
- Didn't I tell you?

92
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,140
Bob Hoskins said he finally
got rid of the place-

93
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:11,658
- Who'd he sell it to?
- Some fella who fixes up houses-

94
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:13,698
Supposed to be very attractive-

95
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:17,013
I just hope he knows what
he's getting into with this house-

96
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,172
It's gonna take a lot of work--

97
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:22,937
A man was found murdered tonight
behind the railroad yards.

98
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:26,298
Details are pending,
awaiting notification of next of kin.

99
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,780
Thank you, Mr Smith-
Have a good weekend-

100
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:32,932
That bastard!

101
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,820
Why didn't he tell us
he was gonna spring a pop quiz?

102
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:39,975
That's the point to a pop quiz--
to surprise you-

103
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,814
Thanks, teach-

104
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,255
Hey, Amy-

105
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,740
Did she finally find out
what you're really like?

106
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:49,301
Buzz off, Evil-

107
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,657
Oh- Call me
anything you want-

108
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:54,210
You're the one failing trig,
not me-

109
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,459
Is this 99 Oak?

110
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,772
No, that's next door-

111
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:26,773
Thanks-

112
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:39,495
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah- I'm in here-

113
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:43,573
Have you seen
the new guy next door?

114
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:46,051
No, but he's got
a live-in carpenter-

115
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,133
With my luck,
he's probably gay-

116
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:49,701
I don't think so-

117
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:52,580
- Why? What do you know that I don't?
- Oh, nothing-

118
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,380
I gotta go study-

119
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:56,692
Study? You?

120
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:34,701
Hi-

121
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,133
I'm really sorry
about the other night-

122
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:42,736
It was my fault, not yours-

123
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:44,050
It was?

124
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,811
Look, Amy, I love you-

125
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,811
I never wanna fight
with you again-

126
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:54,211
I'm so glad we're getting this
straightened out-

127
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,419
- Police have reported a second murder.
- I've been miserable the past two days-

128
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:59,538
The second victim,
whose body was found this morning...

129
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:01,613
was a known prostitute.

130
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,977
Not talkin' to you
on the phone--

131
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,893
Charley, are you
listening to me?

132
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:10,055
The mutilated corpse was found under
the North Creek bridge by the old mill.

133
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,575
There are no leads--

134
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:15,052
- Know what I heard on the police band?
- What?

135
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:17,815
That wasn't the only murder-

136
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:19,733
The second in two days-

137
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,171
And get this--

138
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:26,572
both of'em
had their heads chopped off-

139
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,175
Can you believe it?

140
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,059
You're sick-

141
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:46,615
You're so cool, Brewster!

142
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,135
I can't stand it!

143
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:24,812
Hey, kid!

144
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:30,380
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'-

145
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:32,020
Oh, yeah?

146
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:35,014
Well, just make sure
that it stays that way---

147
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:36,330
kid-

148
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:02,540
Mom, get up! I can't believe
what's happening next door!

149
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,453
- What?
- He has fangs-

150
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,737
The guy who bought the house
has fangs-

151
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:10,417
Fangs- That's lovely-
I have to get up at 7:00 tomorrow-

152
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,333
Fangs? Charley!

153
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:05,095
You forgot something-

154
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,820
This microwave never melts
the marshmallows right-

155
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:53,813
Drink that-

156
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,939
I don't need hot cocoa-
I didn't have a nightmare-

157
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,411
They did kill a girl
over there-

158
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:02,300
- How late did you stay up studying?
- Mom, I'm not sick!

159
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,213
The guy did have fangs-

160
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,658
A bat did fly over my head and a second
later he stepped out of the shadows-

161
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,573
Don't you see what that means?

162
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:10,936
Wait, let me guess-

163
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,057
What?

164
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:14,853
He's a vampire!

165
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:16,651
A what?

166
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:21,577
A vampire! Haven't you listened
to anything I've said?

167
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:26,859
Charley, is this
some sort of a trick---

168
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,773
to get me back?

169
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:32,781
Forget it-
I'm going to the police-

170
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,660
You can't tell the police that-
They'll lock you up-

171
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:38,540
All right, I won't tell them
he's a vampire-

172
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,614
But I sure am gonna tell them
about the two women-

173
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,773
You're sure about this now?

174
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,098
- Yes?
- Mr Dandrige?

175
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:08,650
No, I'm his roommate,
Billy Cole-

176
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:12,178
Lieutenant Lennox, Homicide-
Do you mind if we come in?

177
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:14,412
No, not at all-
Come on in-

178
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,058
This is quite a place
you have here-

179
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:27,214
- Yeah- We're restoring it-
- Where is Mr Dandrige?

180
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:28,894
He's away on business-

181
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,974
- Can I help you?
- There was a murder last night-

182
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:35,259
Your neighbour Charley thinks
he saw the victim in this house-

183
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:37,936
That's impossible-
I was here with Jerry last night-

184
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,695
- There was nobody else here-
- That's a lie-

185
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:43,580
I saw him carry her body out
in a plastic bag-

186
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,971
What do you say to that?

187
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:49,338
Kid's crazy- I took some bags out,
but they were full of trash-

188
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:50,457
Amy?

189
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:52,180
Here, let me show you-

190
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:56,380
Look, the bag I saw
had a body in it, not trash-

191
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:58,817
You actually see the body,
Charley?

192
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,931
- Well, no, but--
- Okay-

193
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:06,731
Let me take you out back- I'll show you
the bags I put in the garbage-

194
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:09,859
- Okay, let's see them-
- I can prove he's lying!

195
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:13,819
Let's look in the basement
instead-

196
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:15,620
What's down there, Charley?

197
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:18,216
Yes, Charley-
What's down there?

198
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:24,011
Obviously the boy's
made a mistake, Officer-

199
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:27,572
A coffin! That's what's down there-
I saw them carry it in-

200
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:29,651
What?

201
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,495
Jerry Dandrige is in it,
sleeping the sleep of the undead-

202
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,493
What are you talking about?

203
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,538
- He's a vampire-
- Uh-oh!

204
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:42,739
I saw him last night- He had fangs,
and he bit her on the neck-

205
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,540
For heaven's sake!

206
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,340
- Come on-
- What?

207
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:48,982
Wait!
We can't just leave like this!

208
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,292
I got a coffin for you!

209
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,259
I don't care what you say!

210
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,453
Lieutenant,
please listen to me!

211
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:01,057
Look, I'm telling you,
Jerry Dandrige is a vampire-

212
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,417
Sure, and I'm Dirty Harry-
Listen-

213
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:07,415
If I ever catch your ass at the station
again, I'm throwing it in jail forever!

214
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:10,300
Lieutenant,
just listen to me for a second!

215
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,055
I know it's crazy!
I know that, but--

216
00:19:13,142 --> 00:19:14,734
Look, Lieutenant--

217
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,420
Oh, my God-

218
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:03,532
Evil!

219
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:09,340
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

220
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,413
The vampire knows
I know about him-

221
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,062
Or at least he will
when he wakes up tonight-

222
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:15,621
What are you talking about?

223
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:17,693
A vampire is living
next door to me---

224
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:20,455
and he's gonna kill me
if I don't protect myself-

225
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,651
- What?
- I haven't got time to explain-

226
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:27,859
Just tell me what to do
to protect myself-

227
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,978
Very funny, Brewster-

228
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,257
Evil, please!
I'm not kidding!

229
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:35,493
- Tell me what to do!
- Don't call me Evil any more!

230
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:39,090
Why should I help you anyway?

231
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:41,173
Look, I've got eight bucks-

232
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,332
Help me and it's yours-

233
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:48,453
Far be it from me
to turn down a fool's money-

234
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:58,261
Where and when do you expect
the vampire to attack?

235
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,139
In my bedroom, tonight-

236
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:07,336
Start with this-

237
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:12,576
But you must have total faith in it
for it to work-

238
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,618
Then get some garlic-

239
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:17,978
Links of the stuff you can wear around
your neck and hang from your window-

240
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:21,737
If he comes for you,
that'll be the way- Then--

241
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,973
Oh, of course!
There's holy water!

242
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:29,135
But you gotta get a priest
to say a blessing over it first-

243
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,897
- That's it?
- I'm afraid so-

244
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:36,213
But your best protection
right now, Charles---

245
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:39,533
is that a vampire
cannot enter your house---

246
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:43,695
without being invited
by the rightful owner first-

247
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:46,137
- Are you sure?
- Positive-

248
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,095
Thank you- Thank you-

249
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:08,420
Charley, could you come here, please?
There's someone I'd like you to meet-

250
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:10,975
Yeah, Mom-

251
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:17,337
Charley, this is
our next-door neighbour---

252
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:19,219
Jerry Dandrige-

253
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:30,895
Hello, Charley-

254
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:38,816
Charley, don't be rude-
Shake hands-

255
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:52,130
- What's he doing here?
- I invited him for a drink-

256
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:53,940
You what?

257
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:56,490
I invited him over-
Why?

258
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:57,935
What's the matter, Charley?

259
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:01,332
Afraid I'd never come over
without being invited first?

260
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,020
You're quite right-

261
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:06,411
Of course, now that
I've been made welcome---

262
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:09,300
I'll probably drop by
quite a bit-

263
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:12,260
In fact,
anytime I feel like it-

264
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:17,300
With your mother's
kind permission, of course-

265
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:19,612
Oh,Jerry, anytime-

266
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:25,090
It's nice that someone interesting has
finally moved into the neighbourhood-

267
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:29,213
Charley, are you all right?

268
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:33,053
Yeah, Mom, I'm fine-

269
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,777
I just gotta get back
to my trig-

270
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,341
Nice to meet you-

271
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,533
See you-

272
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:43,294
Soon-

273
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:13,372
We wouldn't want to wake
your mother, would we?

274
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:17,262
Then I'd have to kill her too-

275
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:18,855
Right?

276
00:27:43,102 --> 00:27:46,617
Do you realize how much trouble
you've caused me?

277
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:48,818
Spying on me-

278
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:51,700
Almost disturbing my sleep
this afternoon-

279
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:55,093
Telling policemen about me!

280
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:08,136
You deserve to die, boy-

281
00:28:12,302 --> 00:28:16,090
Of course, I could give you
something I don't have-

282
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:17,581
A choice-

283
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,938
Forget about me, Charley-

284
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:24,292
Forget about me,
and I'll forget about you-

285
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:26,213
What do you say, Charley?

286
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:39,821
Fool-

287
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:57,935
Charley!

288
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,691
Charley, can you hear me?

289
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:23,461
Charley, is that you?

290
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,261
My door is stuck-

291
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:40,452
- What is going on?
- Nothing- I just had a nightmare-

292
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:44,734
I had one last night-
It was awful-

293
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:48,861
I was at this white sale
and suddenly realized I was stark naked-

294
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:51,733
- Now what is it?
- Nothing-

295
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:53,653
Just raccoons
in the garbage again-

296
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:56,176
- Go back to sleep-
- But what about your nightmare?

297
00:30:56,262 --> 00:30:58,730
- Do you want a Valium?
- I'm fine now-

298
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,290
- Honest-
- I do need my sleep-

299
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:05,011
I start the night shift tomorrow-
3:00 in the morning-

300
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:07,900
- It's so bad for my complexion-
- Good night, Mom-

301
00:31:56,902 --> 00:31:58,938
I know you're there, Charley-

302
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:00,660
I can see you-

303
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:11,654
What's the matter, Charley?

304
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:13,619
Scared?

305
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:18,291
You started this, Charley,
and I'm gonna finish it.

306
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:23,572
I just destroyed your car,
Charley-

307
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:28,458
But that's nothing compared
to what I'm gonna do to you---

308
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:32,175
tomorrow night-

309
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,852
Once again, your host...

310
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:42,694
Peter Vincent.

311
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:45,091
Good evening, horror fans.

312
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:48,060
Did you know
there are a lot of people...

313
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:50,610
who do not believe in vampires?

314
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:52,861
But I do...

315
00:32:52,942 --> 00:32:56,617
because I know they exist.

316
00:32:56,702 --> 00:33:01,378
I have fought them
in all their guises--

317
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:05,137
man, wolves, bats--

318
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:09,579
and I have always won!

319
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,857
That is why they call me...

320
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:15,410
the great vampire killer.

321
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:18,541
Now...

322
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:21,818
watch me do it.

323
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:32,336
Go, Peter-

324
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:39,020
Go-

325
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:53,821
Mr Vincent,
could I talk to you for a minute?

326
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:56,462
Please, Mr Vincent-
It's very, very important-

327
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:59,739
- What do you want me to sign?
- Pardon me?

328
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:01,733
You do want my autograph,
don't you?

329
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:06,093
No, sir, I was curious about
what you said last night on TV---

330
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:08,013
about believing in vampires-

331
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:09,854
What about it?

332
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:11,500
Were you serious?

333
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,655
Oh, absolutely-

334
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:18,220
Unfortunately,
none of your generation seems to be-

335
00:34:18,302 --> 00:34:19,701
What do you mean?

336
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:23,331
I have just been fired because nobody
wants to see vampire killers any more---

337
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:24,935
or vampires either-

338
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,741
Apparently all they want
are demented madmen---

339
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:31,417
running around in ski masks
hacking up young virgins-

340
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,821
Excuse me-

341
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:36,293
I believe in vampires-

342
00:34:42,142 --> 00:34:43,336
That's nice-

343
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:48,257
If only there had been more of you,
perhaps my ratings would've been higher-

344
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:51,971
In fact, I have one
living next door to me-

345
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:53,893
Would you help me kill him?

346
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:57,856
Pardon me?

347
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:00,410
You know that murder
a few days ago?

348
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:02,015
Yes-

349
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:06,061
The guy who lives next door to me
did it, and he's a vampire-

350
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:11,496
If this is your idea of a joke,
I am not amused-

351
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:13,573
Mr Vincent, I am not joking-

352
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:15,732
I am deadly serious-

353
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:19,655
Well, if you would excuse me--

354
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:23,654
But, Mr Vincent,
you have to believe me-

355
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:27,496
I'm telling the truth-
You just said you believed in vampires-

356
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:29,618
I lied-

357
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:31,533
Now, if you will leave me alone--

358
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:33,453
You have to listen to me!

359
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,976
The vampire tried
to kill me last night---

360
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:38,132
and trashed my car
when he didn't succeed-

361
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:43,091
He's gonna be back tonight-
If I don't get help, he's gonna kill me-

362
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,013
Mr Vincent!

363
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,457
Just listen to me for a second-

364
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:48,975
No! Wait!

365
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:51,178
Please, Mr Vincent!
Wait!

366
00:35:57,302 --> 00:36:00,692
- What are you doing here?
- What about you? You just dumped him-

367
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:04,218
- It's none of your business-
- So you do like him-

368
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:05,655
Anybody home?

369
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:15,540
Wow-

370
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:23,333
What's all this for?

371
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,458
Self-defence-

372
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:27,658
Not that I think I'll need it-

373
00:36:27,742 --> 00:36:29,573
He'll be dead before nightfall-

374
00:36:29,662 --> 00:36:32,130
- Who will be?
- Dandrige-

375
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:36,010
I'm waiting for the guy he lives with to
leave, then I'm gonna find his coffin---

376
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:37,979
and pound this
through his heart-

377
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:40,980
That's murder, Charley-

378
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:45,730
You can't murder a vampire, Amy-

379
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:48,382
They're dead- Remember?

380
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:53,260
Listen-
I just taped this-

381
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:58,533
Amy-

382
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:00,453
What are we gonna do?

383
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,533
This is just like Fright Night.

384
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:06,535
Now for the news. Another young woman's
body was discovered this morning...

385
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:08,453
in back of the Sheridan Mall--

386
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,134
I don't have any choice-

387
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:13,133
Somebody has to stop him-

388
00:37:14,822 --> 00:37:17,655
It's gonna be dangerous
going into that house all alone-

389
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:22,896
You'll need all the help
you can get-

390
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:25,891
Somebody like Peter Vincent,
for instance?

391
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,335
I tried him already-

392
00:37:28,502 --> 00:37:31,221
Well, let us try again
before you do anything-

393
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:33,691
There's not enough time, Amy-

394
00:37:33,782 --> 00:37:36,580
Well, what happens
if you go into that house alone---

395
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:38,380
and he gets you?

396
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:40,293
Who's gonna stop him then?

397
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:44,500
Yeah- Then he'll be able to suck his way
through the entire town-

398
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:48,171
Not that it would be
much of a loss-

399
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:50,571
Charley, it's gonna be dark soon-

400
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:54,940
You don't want to go
into that house then, do you?

401
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,331
No, you're right there-

402
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:04,222
- All right, try him again-
- Great-

403
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:07,578
You promise you're not gonna
do anything till you hear from us?

404
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,421
Okay- Come on-

405
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:16,292
You don't believe me,
do you?

406
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:19,700
I love you, Charley-

407
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:21,181
Hey, Amy, come on!

408
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:40,051
Yes?

409
00:38:40,142 --> 00:38:43,100
Mr Vincent,
could we talk to you for a moment?

410
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:46,015
I'm afraid now
is not the best time-

411
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:48,741
Please-
It's very important-

412
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:53,660
Well, if you would just---

413
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:56,575
wait there for one moment--

414
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:59,136
Come in!

415
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:04,251
What can I do for you?

416
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:07,101
An autograph, perhaps?

417
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:11,540
Perhaps an interview
for your school newspaper?

418
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:13,817
I'm afraid this is
much more important-

419
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:16,735
Really?

420
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:21,780
What could be more important
than my autograph?

421
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,454
Saving a boy's life-

422
00:39:24,302 --> 00:39:25,781
Oh- Yes-

423
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:29,571
I can see where that
could be more important-

424
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:33,780
Perhaps you would care to explain-

425
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:37,780
Remember a fruitcake kid
named Charley Brewster?

426
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:39,215
He said he saw you-

427
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:43,221
The one who believes
a vampire lives next to him-

428
00:39:43,302 --> 00:39:45,941
Oh, yes-
You know, he is insane-

429
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:49,173
Oh, my dear---

430
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,696
I do hope he's not
a friend of yours-

431
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:54,819
Yeah, she's got the hots
for the creep-

432
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:56,130
Amy!

433
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:58,417
We need your help to stop him-

434
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:01,175
He really believes
his next-door neighbour is a vampire---

435
00:40:01,262 --> 00:40:03,218
and he's planning to kill him-

436
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:05,611
With a stake through the heart-

437
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:09,978
Are you two serious?

438
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,495
Oh, my dear-

439
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:15,858
Your friend needs a psychiatrist,
not a vampire killer-

440
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:18,502
- Please, Mr Vincent-
- I'm afraid not-

441
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,540
You see, Hollywood beckons-

442
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:25,979
I have just been offered
a starring role in a major film-

443
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:28,974
I have even had to quit
Fright Night.

444
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:31,053
- I'll give you money-
- How much?

445
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:33,053
I have a $500 savings bond-

446
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,336
I'll take it-

447
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:41,460
Now, how are we going to cure
your little friend---

448
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,339
of this delusion?

449
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:45,933
I got it all figured out-

450
00:40:46,022 --> 00:40:48,377
We all go next door
to the neighbour---

451
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:51,499
and you perform some kind of
vampire test on him---

452
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,538
to pronounce him human-

453
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:57,092
You know-
Like in Orgy of the Damned?

454
00:40:57,182 --> 00:40:59,980
Where you looked in the mirror---

455
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:04,772
the guy didn't have a reflection,
so then you knew he was a vampire-

456
00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:07,301
Oh, yes-

457
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:12,057
That was one
of my favourite roles-

458
00:41:15,582 --> 00:41:18,050
Do you know---

459
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,973
I still---

460
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:22,853
have the prop-

461
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:54,737
It's for you-

462
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:03,613
Yes, this is Jerry Dandrige-

463
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:09,051
I see-

464
00:42:09,142 --> 00:42:10,495
Well, yes, of course-

465
00:42:10,582 --> 00:42:13,574
I'm always willing
to help young people---

466
00:42:13,662 --> 00:42:16,654
but I'm afraid that crosses
are out of the question-

467
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,701
You see,
I've been reborn recently-

468
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:22,613
He's a reborn Christian-

469
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:24,977
He thinks crosses
would be sacrilegious-

470
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:28,941
- Ask him how he feels about holy water-
- How about holy water?

471
00:42:29,022 --> 00:42:30,421
No- Won't do either-

472
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:33,938
Tell him it's ordinary tap water-
All he has to do is sip it-

473
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:40,136
Oh, yes- Yes- Okay-
That sounds fine-

474
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:44,454
But don't bring him over
until 6:00 tomorrow-

475
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,533
I'll be out until then-

476
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:53,134
Seems we don't have to go out
tonight after all-

477
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:57,420
His friends are bringing him over
tomorrow night---

478
00:42:57,502 --> 00:42:59,572
to prove to him that I'm not---

479
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:01,981
a vampire-

480
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:09,140
It's 6:10- He said
he was gonna be here at 6:00-

481
00:43:09,222 --> 00:43:11,531
He said he'd be here-
He'll be here-

482
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:13,935
Here he comes!

483
00:43:20,382 --> 00:43:23,215
Thank you-
Charley Brewster, I presume-

484
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:25,133
Peter Vincent, vampire killer-

485
00:43:25,222 --> 00:43:28,294
I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate this-

486
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:30,213
Good evening-
Now, down to business-

487
00:43:30,302 --> 00:43:34,454
Where is the lair of the suspected
creature of the night?

488
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,611
There-

489
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:39,293
Oh, yes-
I see what you mean-

490
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:43,254
There is
a distinct possibility-

491
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:46,413
Now, shall we go?

492
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:48,732
Wait-
Where's your stakes and hammers?

493
00:43:48,822 --> 00:43:50,733
I left them in my bag-

494
00:43:50,822 --> 00:43:52,699
You're not going in there
without them-

495
00:43:52,782 --> 00:43:56,900
But I have to prove that he is a vampire
before I kill him, Charley-

496
00:43:56,982 --> 00:43:59,576
Look, I know he's a vampire!

497
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:02,460
I am the one
who has to know, Charley-

498
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,419
How are you gonna do that?

499
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,780
This is holy water-

500
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:09,296
If a drop touches him,
he will blister-

501
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:11,612
I have asked him to drink it---

502
00:44:11,702 --> 00:44:14,262
while we all watch-

503
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:15,821
He readily agreed-

504
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:19,212
But if I'm right and you prove
he is a vampire---

505
00:44:19,302 --> 00:44:20,576
he'll kill us all-

506
00:44:20,662 --> 00:44:22,414
No, he won't, Charley-

507
00:44:22,502 --> 00:44:25,494
After all, I am here to protect you,
and I am Peter Vincent!

508
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,459
I know, Mr Vincent, but--

509
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,015
Hey! Peter Vincent-

510
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:32,820
Billy Cole-

511
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:33,857
This is a pleasure-

512
00:44:35,062 --> 00:44:36,893
Won't you all come in?

513
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:43,261
And Charley-

514
00:44:50,702 --> 00:44:53,535
Hey,Jer! They're here-

515
00:44:55,342 --> 00:44:57,617
Perhaps he didn't hear you-

516
00:44:57,702 --> 00:44:59,932
He heard me, all right-

517
00:45:20,422 --> 00:45:21,616
Mr Vincent-

518
00:45:22,662 --> 00:45:24,175
I've seen all your films---

519
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:26,981
and I've found them---

520
00:45:27,062 --> 00:45:28,256
very amusing-

521
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:30,412
Oh- Thank you-

522
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:33,859
And who are these two---

523
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,542
attractive young people?

524
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:40,413
Ed Thompson-

525
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:43,294
Amy Peterson-

526
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:04,256
Charmed-

527
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:10,415
Isn't that what vampires
are supposed to do, Charley?

528
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,016
- Please-
- That's some vampire, Brewster-

529
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:16,740
God, he's neat-

530
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:29,938
Please excuse the mess-
I haven't finished unpacking-

531
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:32,695
Where do you keep your coffin?
Or do you have more than one?

532
00:46:32,782 --> 00:46:34,261
Charley!

533
00:46:34,342 --> 00:46:36,412
It's all right, Mr Vincent-

534
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,255
I'm quite used to it by now-

535
00:46:39,342 --> 00:46:43,096
As you may or may not know, Charley even
brought the police over a few days ago-

536
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:44,615
Charley, you didn't!

537
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:48,536
Damn right I did- Only they didn't
believe me any more than any of you-

538
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:51,056
But you'll believe me soon-

539
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,019
Give him the holy water-

540
00:46:54,822 --> 00:46:57,461
Charley, there's no reason
to be rude about this-

541
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:00,056
It's perfectly all right,
Mr Vincent-

542
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:04,013
Where is it?

543
00:47:09,862 --> 00:47:13,377
And are you sure
that this is holy water?

544
00:47:14,382 --> 00:47:15,451
Positive-

545
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:19,300
I saw Father Scanlon
bless it myself-

546
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:23,417
Get ready to run-
I'll protect you-

547
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:35,615
Bottoms up-

548
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:51,610
There-

549
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,135
Satisfied?

550
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:55,734
Totally-

551
00:47:57,582 --> 00:48:00,335
Well, now, Charley,
you saw that-

552
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:04,973
Are you convinced now
that Mr Dandrige is not a vampire?

553
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:06,734
It can't be-

554
00:48:06,822 --> 00:48:09,052
But, Charley, you saw it-

555
00:48:09,142 --> 00:48:13,215
You know as well as I do that
no vampire can drink blessed water-

556
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:16,220
Then it wasn't blessed-

557
00:48:16,302 --> 00:48:18,418
Are you calling me a liar,
young man?

558
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:21,772
If he's not a vampire---

559
00:48:21,862 --> 00:48:23,215
have him touch this-

560
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:29,611
You've made
a fool of yourself once-

561
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:32,421
There's no reason
to compound the error-

562
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:35,460
You've already caused your friends
quite enough pain-

563
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:44,730
You wouldn't want to cause them
any more, would you?

564
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:01,653
No, of course not-

565
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:05,337
Then you're finally convinced
I'm not a vampire either?

566
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:06,821
Right?

567
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:09,136
Yes-

568
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:12,578
Well, I'm glad that's settled-

569
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:17,138
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, Mr Vincent-

570
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:20,020
- You've been a great help-
- Glad to be of service-

571
00:49:20,102 --> 00:49:24,095
It was very nice meeting both of you-
Feel free to drop by anytime-

572
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:26,412
You'll always be welcome-

573
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:28,652
I'd like that, Mr Dandrige-

574
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:30,255
Please call me Jerry-

575
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,253
Let's get out of here-

576
00:49:32,342 --> 00:49:34,492
That goes for you too, Ed-

577
00:49:34,582 --> 00:49:37,858
I expect we have a lot of the same
interests-- horror movies, the occult-

578
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:43,258
Something wrong, Mr Vincent?

579
00:49:44,502 --> 00:49:46,970
I just felt a little--

580
00:49:51,062 --> 00:49:53,656
It was just my clumsiness-

581
00:49:56,022 --> 00:49:57,375
Are you sure?

582
00:49:58,462 --> 00:49:59,861
I'm positive-

583
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:02,740
We have been taking up
much too much of your time-

584
00:50:02,822 --> 00:50:05,655
Thank you so much-
Come along now, everybody-

585
00:50:07,142 --> 00:50:08,973
Thank you- Bye-bye-

586
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,731
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing-

587
00:50:14,822 --> 00:50:17,620
- Then why are you shaking?
- I'm not shaking-

588
00:50:17,702 --> 00:50:21,377
You saw something that convinced you
he was a vampire, didn't you?

589
00:50:21,462 --> 00:50:24,260
- Of course not!
- Please, Mr Vincent-

590
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:26,333
You have to tell me-

591
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:27,775
All right!

592
00:50:29,862 --> 00:50:32,251
He didn't cast a reflection
in my mirror-

593
00:50:33,382 --> 00:50:36,340
- Satisfied now?
- You have to call the police!

594
00:50:36,422 --> 00:50:37,821
Shit!

595
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,100
Where are you goin',
pencil dick?

596
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:43,376
- Home!
- No way-

597
00:50:43,462 --> 00:50:45,532
We walk Amy home first-

598
00:50:48,182 --> 00:50:50,650
Looks just like her,
doesn't she?

599
00:50:56,742 --> 00:50:57,811
One good thing--

600
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,699
they'll never believe him now-

601
00:51:07,102 --> 00:51:08,581
No?

602
00:51:14,582 --> 00:51:16,413
- Let's cut through here-
- No way!

603
00:51:16,502 --> 00:51:19,539
We want people and lights-
The more, the better-

604
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:22,819
Listen, Brewster,
vampires don't exist-

605
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:24,733
Haven't you figured that out yet?

606
00:51:24,822 --> 00:51:26,813
What if you're wrong, Evil?

607
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:29,700
What if Dandrige is a vampire
and he thinks you know it?

608
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:32,740
Would you walk down
that alley then?

609
00:51:34,502 --> 00:51:36,857
Oh, fuck you, Brewster-

610
00:51:36,942 --> 00:51:39,410
Evil, just stick with us,
all right?

611
00:51:39,502 --> 00:51:42,300
Forget it!
You may be chicken shit, but I'm not-

612
00:51:44,662 --> 00:51:46,493
- What'll we do?
- Let him go-

613
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:49,858
No vampire's gonna want him anyway-
Probably give him blood poisoning-

614
00:51:55,942 --> 00:51:57,853
Jesus! I warned him!

615
00:51:57,942 --> 00:52:00,740
He got me, Charley!
He bit me!

616
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:05,458
You know what you're gonna
have to do now, don't you?

617
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,055
Kill me-

618
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:08,734
Kill me, Charley---

619
00:52:08,822 --> 00:52:11,780
before I turn into a vampire---

620
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,739
and give you a hickey!

621
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:17,260
You asshole!

622
00:52:19,062 --> 00:52:22,020
You really believed me,
you poor dope!

623
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:23,501
You'll get yours someday-

624
00:52:23,582 --> 00:52:26,699
Oh, yeah? When?
When I'm bit by a vampire?

625
00:52:26,782 --> 00:52:30,252
There are no such things
as vampires, fruitcake!

626
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:18,379
Charley, Amy, is that you?

627
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:26,617
It's not working-
I'm not scared-

628
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:44,861
Hello, Edward-

629
00:54:47,342 --> 00:54:49,731
You don't have to be
afraid of me-

630
00:54:51,102 --> 00:54:52,854
I know what it's like
being different-

631
00:54:54,462 --> 00:54:56,692
Only they won't
pick on you any more---

632
00:54:57,622 --> 00:54:58,771
or beat you up-

633
00:55:00,702 --> 00:55:01,976
I'll see to that-

634
00:55:04,062 --> 00:55:06,530
All you have to do
is take my hand-

635
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:08,651
Here, Edward-

636
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:10,619
Take my hand-

637
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:35,299
What was that?

638
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:40,850
Just Evil
messing around again-

639
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:44,935
Cut it out, Evil!
It's not funny!

640
00:55:45,022 --> 00:55:48,298
Amy, what if Evil
was really in trouble?

641
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:51,692
You're not gonna let him
sucker you in again, are you?

642
00:56:01,902 --> 00:56:05,178
Don't tell me
this is a power outage-

643
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:07,253
Well, what else would it be?

644
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:58,138
Hey! You can't come in here!

645
00:57:10,342 --> 00:57:12,651
- Who are you calling?
- The police-

646
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:15,537
Who is it?

647
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:16,850
Me- Evil Ed-

648
00:57:16,942 --> 00:57:19,410
- What do you want?
- There's a vampire out here-

649
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,981
Let me in-

650
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:28,295
What are we going to do?

651
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:31,901
What are you gonna do?

652
00:57:38,582 --> 00:57:40,140
Not me!

653
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,613
I used to admire you-
You know that?

654
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,613
But, of course---

655
00:57:54,702 --> 00:57:56,533
that was before---

656
00:57:56,622 --> 00:57:59,739
I found out
what a fake you were!

657
00:57:59,822 --> 00:58:01,938
Peter Vincent---

658
00:58:02,022 --> 00:58:03,899
the great vampire killer!

659
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:34,410
What have you done to me?

660
00:58:34,502 --> 00:58:35,696
Back!

661
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:44,060
The master will kill you
for this-

662
00:58:44,142 --> 00:58:46,372
But not fast-

663
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:49,932
Slowly- Oh, so slowly-

664
00:58:50,022 --> 00:58:51,171
Back-

665
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:54,373
I say back!

666
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:02,739
He doesn't believe me!

667
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:07,179
I'm scared, Charley-
I'm really scared-

668
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:10,015
I am not going to let him
get you, Amy-

669
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:12,893
I promise-

670
00:59:14,502 --> 00:59:16,652
You got Peter Vincent's number?

671
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:21,736
He doesn't care about us!
I paid him to be there today-

672
00:59:21,822 --> 00:59:24,495
It doesn't matter, Amy-

673
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:28,291
We don't have any choice-
Now give me his number-

674
01:00:49,222 --> 01:00:51,213
Look, you've gotta help us-

675
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:53,770
Dandrige has me and Amy
trapped in this club downtown-

676
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,500
No, Charley- I'm sorry-

677
01:00:55,582 --> 01:00:57,459
I just can't do that-

678
01:00:57,542 --> 01:01:01,171
You've gotta come- You're the only one
who knows what's going on-

679
01:03:37,702 --> 01:03:39,579
Let her go-

680
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:49,811
Filthy son of a bitch!

681
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,613
Shouldn't lose
your temper, Charley-

682
01:03:58,462 --> 01:03:59,975
It isn't polite-

683
01:04:00,062 --> 01:04:02,371
You can't kill me here-

684
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:06,732
I don't wanna kill you, Charley-

685
01:04:06,822 --> 01:04:09,655
I want you to bring Peter Vincent
to my house--just the two of you-

686
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:13,974
That is, if you ever want
to see Amy again-

687
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:24,612
- Let her go!
- I got him-

688
01:04:24,702 --> 01:04:27,341
- She's mine-
- You want chicken, go someplace else-

689
01:04:27,422 --> 01:04:29,333
- Out of my way-
- Move me-

690
01:04:33,742 --> 01:04:35,334
Leon!

691
01:05:51,902 --> 01:05:54,939
- Peter, open the door!
- Who is it?

692
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:56,933
It's me- Charley Brewster-
Let me in-

693
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,295
- Are you one of them?
- What are you talking about?

694
01:06:02,382 --> 01:06:05,772
Here- Grab this-

695
01:06:11,822 --> 01:06:13,494
Come on-

696
01:06:14,502 --> 01:06:16,299
We don't have very much time-

697
01:06:16,382 --> 01:06:18,691
Dandrige chased me and Amy
all over town-

698
01:06:18,782 --> 01:06:21,216
He trapped us in a nightclub-

699
01:06:22,262 --> 01:06:24,492
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving-

700
01:06:24,582 --> 01:06:26,652
- You can't!
-Just watch me-

701
01:06:26,742 --> 01:06:28,937
But Dandrige has Amy!

702
01:06:29,022 --> 01:06:31,092
He's gonna kill her
unless we come to his house-

703
01:06:31,182 --> 01:06:34,618
Oh, my God- The police-
I'll call the police-

704
01:06:34,702 --> 01:06:37,933
No, Peter- No!
They won't believe you- I've tried-

705
01:06:39,022 --> 01:06:41,616
Peter, it's just us-

706
01:06:42,822 --> 01:06:45,256
We're gonna have to save Amy-

707
01:06:45,342 --> 01:06:47,219
I can't-

708
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:55,895
l---

709
01:06:58,782 --> 01:07:01,899
was paid to be there today-

710
01:07:01,982 --> 01:07:03,859
I know-

711
01:07:04,822 --> 01:07:06,653
And you still want me
to help you?

712
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:09,051
Yes!

713
01:07:09,142 --> 01:07:12,771
You're Peter Vincent,
the great vampire killer!

714
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,171
That is a character in a movie!

715
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:18,698
That isn't even my real name-

716
01:07:18,782 --> 01:07:21,171
I'm terrified-

717
01:07:23,182 --> 01:07:25,491
I'm sorry, Charley, but I am-

718
01:07:30,862 --> 01:07:34,298
I can't do it alone, Peter-

719
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,778
If you don't help,
Amy is gonna die-

720
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:40,693
Me too, probably-

721
01:07:43,742 --> 01:07:45,619
Please, Peter-

722
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,701
I'm sorry, Charley-

723
01:08:31,102 --> 01:08:34,981
She's someone I knew
a long time ago-

724
01:08:48,942 --> 01:08:50,534
Where am I?

725
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:56,139
Where's Charley?

726
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:00,416
Where?

727
01:11:42,422 --> 01:11:44,890
Peter Vincent-
Ready to do battle with the undead-

728
01:11:44,982 --> 01:11:46,381
This is serious-

729
01:11:46,462 --> 01:11:49,260
I am serious- Here-
Hold this- Go on-

730
01:11:52,902 --> 01:11:55,052
Let's see-
Flashlight, stakes, hammer-

731
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:56,973
Ah, yes- Cross-

732
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,257
What about Billy Cole?
How are you gonna stop him?

733
01:11:59,342 --> 01:12:02,414
I'm going to use this-
It is from Orgy of the Damned.

734
01:12:02,502 --> 01:12:05,892
What if he's not human?
Bullets aren't gonna stop him then-

735
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:08,780
He walks around in the daylight,
now, doesn't he?

736
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:10,215
- Hmm?
- Yeah-

737
01:12:10,302 --> 01:12:13,533
Well, then-
He is human- Come on-

738
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:15,419
You don't have to do this-

739
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,333
- I want to thank you--
- Not now-

740
01:12:23,182 --> 01:12:25,013
What's wrong?

741
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:29,500
Nothing- Nothing at all-

742
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:35,816
Are you crazy?

743
01:12:35,902 --> 01:12:37,699
Not the front door-

744
01:12:37,782 --> 01:12:39,738
Let's go around the back
and sneak in-

745
01:12:45,422 --> 01:12:47,253
Too late-

746
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:53,892
I am Peter Vincent---

747
01:12:53,982 --> 01:12:55,813
the great vampire killer-

748
01:13:15,982 --> 01:13:17,813
This way-

749
01:13:31,902 --> 01:13:33,733
Did you hear something?

750
01:13:35,342 --> 01:13:36,741
No-

751
01:13:38,462 --> 01:13:41,818
Let's come back at dawn-
You see, he'll be asleep then-

752
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:43,893
We'll have a better chance
of getting Amy-

753
01:13:43,982 --> 01:13:47,418
And Amy will be dead by then too-
Now come on-

754
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:08,255
Welcome to Fright Night.

755
01:14:18,262 --> 01:14:20,173
For real-

756
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:22,741
Where's Amy?

757
01:14:22,822 --> 01:14:25,097
Up here-

758
01:14:25,182 --> 01:14:27,571
All you have to do
is get by me-

759
01:14:31,182 --> 01:14:33,776
Back, spawn of Satan!

760
01:14:38,902 --> 01:14:41,052
Oh, really?

761
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:00,182
You have to have faith---

762
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,378
for this to work on me---

763
01:15:02,462 --> 01:15:04,453
Mr Vincent-

764
01:15:12,022 --> 01:15:14,217
Stop!

765
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,337
Back-

766
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:26,614
We're gonna make it-

767
01:15:49,622 --> 01:15:51,419
Mrs Brewster!

768
01:15:56,862 --> 01:15:58,853
Operator, get me the--

769
01:16:07,182 --> 01:16:09,491
Thank God-
The phone wires have been cut-

770
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,301
I know-

771
01:16:16,342 --> 01:16:18,173
I did it!

772
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:22,013
Where is Charley's mother?

773
01:16:27,302 --> 01:16:32,012
Well, apparently
she's working nights-

774
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:35,820
But she left a note-

775
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:49,341
His dinner's in the oven!

776
01:20:06,622 --> 01:20:08,977
You wanted her-
There she is-

777
01:20:11,622 --> 01:20:14,375
Here- You're gonna need it-

778
01:20:14,462 --> 01:20:16,339
Just before dawn-

779
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,612
What have you done to her?

780
01:22:29,462 --> 01:22:31,657
I'm gonna have to break
the door down-

781
01:22:31,742 --> 01:22:33,733
You make as much noise
as you can.

782
01:22:35,782 --> 01:22:38,091
Help!

783
01:22:38,182 --> 01:22:40,138
Let me out!

784
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:45,137
Please! Open the door!
Help! Somebody!

785
01:22:45,222 --> 01:22:48,578
I think she just opened her eyes-

786
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:56,299
All right- Grab her-
Let's get out of here-

787
01:22:56,382 --> 01:22:58,691
We can't- Look-

788
01:23:02,462 --> 01:23:04,054
Oh, my God-

789
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:08,613
Something wrong?

790
01:23:08,702 --> 01:23:12,092
Yes- We have a visitor-

791
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,932
Is it too late to save her?

792
01:23:16,022 --> 01:23:17,421
No-

793
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:21,415
Not if we kill Dandrige
before dawn-

794
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:24,100
Are you sure?

795
01:23:24,182 --> 01:23:26,491
So far, everything has been
like it was in movies-

796
01:23:26,582 --> 01:23:29,142
Now we just have to keep hoping-

797
01:23:32,022 --> 01:23:33,853
Let's go-

798
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:50,300
Well, what do we have here?

799
01:23:52,182 --> 01:23:53,979
Vampire killers?

800
01:23:58,222 --> 01:23:59,655
Stop or I'll shoot-

801
01:24:01,622 --> 01:24:02,850
I mean it-

802
01:24:02,942 --> 01:24:04,853
Don't force me to shoot-

803
01:24:17,062 --> 01:24:18,097
Stop!

804
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:22,375
We have him-

805
01:24:25,742 --> 01:24:27,653
Do you?

806
01:24:32,062 --> 01:24:33,939
What did he mean by that?

807
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:37,496
Nothing-
He was just bluffing-

808
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:39,661
She's worse!

809
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:42,131
Come on-
We're running out of time-

810
01:26:54,942 --> 01:26:56,819
Amy-

811
01:26:58,022 --> 01:26:59,375
Awake-

812
01:27:00,822 --> 01:27:03,734
I command you---

813
01:27:03,822 --> 01:27:07,610
to awake!

814
01:27:14,022 --> 01:27:18,891
Show me how much
you love me, Amy-

815
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:22,291
Kill them---

816
01:27:23,382 --> 01:27:24,974
both!

817
01:27:32,062 --> 01:27:33,780
He's on the roof-

818
01:27:33,862 --> 01:27:35,693
I'm going up there-

819
01:28:05,422 --> 01:28:07,572
He's not up here-

820
01:28:07,662 --> 01:28:09,459
Look out!

821
01:28:11,902 --> 01:28:13,779
He's going downstairs-

822
01:28:26,702 --> 01:28:29,774
So-

823
01:28:42,102 --> 01:28:43,251
Stay back-

824
01:28:48,302 --> 01:28:49,451
Back-

825
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:04,011
You have to have faith
for that to work---

826
01:29:04,102 --> 01:29:07,139
Mr Vincent!

827
01:29:07,222 --> 01:29:09,338
Remember?

828
01:29:50,822 --> 01:29:55,896
You're out of time,
Mr Dandrige-

829
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:57,938
Look over your shoulder-

830
01:30:10,422 --> 01:30:11,741
Back!

831
01:30:51,182 --> 01:30:53,776
- Are you all right?
- Yeah- Quick- He's in the basement-

832
01:31:04,142 --> 01:31:06,895
Quick- His coffin has got to be
down here somewhere-

833
01:31:24,822 --> 01:31:26,301
What was that?

834
01:31:26,382 --> 01:31:28,976
You keep searching-
I'll check it out-

835
01:31:45,342 --> 01:31:46,980
Amy?

836
01:31:47,062 --> 01:31:49,098
It's me-

837
01:31:49,182 --> 01:31:50,376
I know-

838
01:32:09,942 --> 01:32:11,375
I found it-

839
01:32:13,222 --> 01:32:15,178
Don't be frightened, Charley-

840
01:32:15,262 --> 01:32:16,934
Hurry- Get it open!

841
01:32:17,022 --> 01:32:18,455
He's locked it
from the inside-

842
01:32:20,102 --> 01:32:21,421
What's wrong?

843
01:32:23,902 --> 01:32:27,212
Don't you want me any more?

844
01:32:33,462 --> 01:32:36,579
It's not my fault, Charley-

845
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:40,814
You promised
you wouldn't let him get me!

846
01:32:40,902 --> 01:32:43,052
You promised!

847
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:25,294
Charley, watch out!

848
01:35:27,582 --> 01:35:29,300
Amy!

849
01:37:13,502 --> 01:37:15,936
Look! We've been
going in a circle.

850
01:37:16,022 --> 01:37:18,058
We're right back
where we started from.

851
01:37:18,142 --> 01:37:22,499
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fright Night Theatre.

852
01:37:22,582 --> 01:37:24,698
This is Peter Vincent...

853
01:37:24,782 --> 01:37:27,615
back once more with you...

854
01:37:27,702 --> 01:37:30,091
as host of Fright Night-

855
01:37:30,182 --> 01:37:34,892
I thought I'd let the vampires
rest for a little while.

856
01:37:37,502 --> 01:37:38,901
Right, Charley?

857
01:37:40,382 --> 01:37:44,375
Tonight, the threat comes
not from beyond the grave...

858
01:37:44,462 --> 01:37:47,420
but from beyond the stars...

859
01:37:47,502 --> 01:37:51,495
as alien beings stalk
an unwary summer camp...

860
01:37:51,582 --> 01:37:55,211
in Mars Wants Flesh-

861
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:58,135
I do not star in it.

862
01:38:19,862 --> 01:38:21,261
Is something wrong?

863
01:38:26,262 --> 01:38:28,139
Nothing-

864
01:38:46,222 --> 01:38:49,020
Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!
