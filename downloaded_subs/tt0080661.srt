Dr. Elliott, this is Lou Freeman.
I'm still in Chicago.

179
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,055
I won't be back in time
for our appointment on Friday.

I'll give you a call on Monday, OK?

(MAN WHISPERING) This is Bobbi.

185
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,036
You won't see me anymore,

186
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,872
so I'm going to have a little session
with your machine.

187
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,418
Doctor, I'm so unhappy.

188
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,505
I'm a girl inside this man's body,

189
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,132
and you're not helping me to get out.

190
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,468
So I got a new shrink.

191
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,512
Levy's his name,
and he's going to sign the papers

192
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,847
so I can get my operation.

193
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,519
I borrowed your razor and...

194
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,023
Well, you'll read all about it.

195
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,860

One of your patients, Kate Miller,
was killed tonight.

00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,868
I wonder if you'd stop down
at the precinct and ask for me.

I think you can help me with.

Hey, Eddie. Listen, I want
you to take this over to the lab

212
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,579
- and get some pictures made of it.
- Yeah.

213

- Keep an eye on her.
- Right.

- OK.

- Yeah.
- I'm Dr. Elliott.

Oh, Doctor.

217
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,466
Listen, would you have a seat outside
my office in the corner over there.

218
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,551
- I'll be right with you.
- All right.

219
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,512
So give me three copies...

My mom wouldn't be dead
if I had gone with her.

227

You shouldn't feel responsible
for your mother's death.

228
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,156
If you talk about it,
I might be able to help.

229
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,699
Do you know who killed her?

230
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,868
- No.
- Then you can't help, can you?

231
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,578
Not now maybe.

232
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,624
But later, if you want someone
to talk to about all this.

233
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,711
- Ask your father to call...
- No, he's not my father.

234
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,880
My father was killed in Vietnam.

235
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,223

MARINO: She was picked up by Lockman
at the museum.

241
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,084
She spent the afternoon at his place

242
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,294
and was chopped up in the elevator
on the way out.

243
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,004
That girl out there saw the murderer.

244
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,633
ELLIOTT: That's terrible.

245
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,469
- Do you know who it is?
- Some broad.

246
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,555
- A woman?
- Yeah.

247
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,974
Miss Blake didn't get
a great look at her face

248
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,268
because she had on these big sunglasses.

249
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,769
Is there anything I can do to help?

250
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,523
Yeah. When you spoke with Mrs. Miller...

251
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,401
...did she say
she was going to meet anybody?

252
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,819
No.

253
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,988
Did she leave your office
with anybody?

254
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,322
No.

255
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,157
What was she seeing you for?

256
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,827
Nothing too serious. She had
some problems with her marriage,

257
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,787
and I was helping her work them out.

258
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,289
What kind of problems?

259
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,833
Are you married, Detective Marino?

260
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,045
- Yeah.
- Children?

261
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,171
Two sons.

262
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,841
When was the last time
you had intercourse with your wife?

263
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,846
Now what the fuck is it to you?

264
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,433
That's exactly how I feel about
your questions concerning Mrs. Miller.

265
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,607
Hey, look, Doctor,

266
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,860
we got a brutally murdered woman here,

267
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,071
who passed the point
of being embarrassed

268
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,324
by anything you might tell me.

269
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,996
I guess you're right.
I'm sorry,

270
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,790
but I'm not used to discussing
a patient's case with outsiders.

271
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,376
I'm not an outsider. I'm a cop.

272
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,713
Now, let's make it easy for you.

273
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,632
Was she looking to get killed?

274
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,383
- You mean, was she suicidal?
- Yeah.

275
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,551
- No.
- No.

276
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,220
So why did she pick up
this Lockman character?

277
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,972
- He could've been a killer.
- But he wasn't.

278
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,684
Yeah, but the next guy might have been.
You know, if at first you don't succeed.

279
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,186
Do you think she wanted to get killed?

280
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,896
Don't you? Look.

281
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,691
We got some hot-pants broad
cruising around for some action.

282
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,737
The guy she picked up went down on her
in a cab, for Christ's sake.

283
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,991
I got a blow-by-blow description
from the cabby.

284
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,077
After she finishes with him,

285
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,954
she comes on to some weirdo
in the elevator?

286
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:30,249
Hey. There's all kinds of ways
to get killed in this city,

287
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,168
if you're looking for it.

288
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,341
Well... Yes, she did have a problem
about her sexual worth.

289
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,596
And this morning she asked me
if I was attracted to her.

290
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,682
Yeah, but you're not a psycho.

291
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,519
You do know something, though,
don't you, Doc?

292
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,647
Yes, of course.
I do some work at Bellevue.

293
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,026
Could she have met one of these nuts
at your office?

294
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,446
I mean, some kind of weirdo she could've
turned on that might have followed her?

295
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,702
The term we use, Detective Marino,
is not "weirdo,"

296
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,621
but a person
suffering from emotional dysfunction

297
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,290
and a problem of maladaption.

298
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,042
And they never come to my office.

299
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,380
Are you sure?

300
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,093
How about a new patient?

301
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,639
I mean, how do you know
how nuts they are until you see them?

302
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,808
That's possible,
but it's hardly likely...

303
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,143
Doctor.

304
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,397
You're not protecting
one of your patients now, are you?

305
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,190
Absolutely not.

306
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,155
Well, Doc,
you've got to look at it my way.

307
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,701
See, we got no leads,
except a witness out there

308
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,579
who maybe should take a look
at all your patients

309
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,164
that were around that morning.

310
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,125
And that way, I can be absolutely sure

311
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,837
that my weirdo isn't your

312
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,007
"person suffering
from emotional dysfunctions

313
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,385
and problems of maladaption."

314
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,974
MIKE: Peter, come on, let's go home.

315
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,267
MARINO: Excuse me.

316
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,005
OK, Doctor.

317
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,884
I'm sorry you're not more cooperative,
which means that

318
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,429
I'm just going to have to waste some
time in getting a court order

319
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,264
to check out your appointment book.

320
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,432
I'm sorry, too.

321
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,685
But I feel I must protect
the confidentiality of my patients.

322
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:59,732
Of course, we're just two professionals
doing our job.

323
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,319
It's too bad we can't work together.
Come on.

324
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,115
Thank you very much for your help.
I'll be in touch.

325
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,165
WOMAN: Yes, thank you for waiting.
This is the answering service.

326
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,668
- Would you care to leave a message?
- Yes, I would.

327
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,003
- This is Dr. Elliott.
- How do you spell that?

328
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,798
E-L-L-I-O-T-T.

329
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,424
What is the message?

330
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,344
Would you please say
that I would very much like to see her,

331
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,179
and could she call me at my office.

332
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,267
So, Miss Blake.

333
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,396
Are you still living
at 93 Nassau Street?

334
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,981
That's right.

335
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,775
Tell me, how did you happen to be
in that building

336
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,777
that Mrs. Miller was killed in?

337
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,238
I was visiting a friend.

338
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,282
And who was that?

339
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:53,202
Well... it's sort of embarrassing.

340
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,663
I'd really rather not say.

341
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,998
Why?

342
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,626
He's married.

343
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,840
What kind of building is this?
Everybody's getting laid after lunch.

344
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,763
I didn't say I was "getting laid,"
to use your expression.

345
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,392
What's the matter?

346
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,937
- I'm a little crude for you?

Look, Miss Blake, let's cut this shit.
I got all the dope on you right here.

348

Apprehended at the Park Avenue Hotel.

352

but you're still a whore.

356
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,140
Fuck you.

357
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,225
No, fuck you.

358

with your prints on it.

Why would I want to kill her?

You tell me.

363
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,863
I told you. There was a blonde woman
in the elevator...

364
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,698
Yeah, except nobody else saw
this blonde woman

She was in the elevator. I saw her.

368
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,333
So, what were you doing there?

369
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,210
- I had a job.
- Who?

370

don't you?

371

- Hey, I didn't kill her.

00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,049

373
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,052
Ted, I didn't get his last name.
He's from out of town.

374

Well, that's great.
Yeah, Ted from out of town.

as the blonde from the elevator.

376
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,560
It's true.
He was standing right behind me.

377
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,063
He saw the elevator doors open
and that...

378
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,233
...woman inside all cut up and bleeding.

379
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,902
I know all about Mrs. Miller.
We got her downstairs.

380
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,029
But what about this blonde?
Did he see her, too?

381
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,573
I don't know.

382
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,246
Well, look, Miss... Miss Blake.

383
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:05,209
You're going to save me a lot of trouble
by finding this Ted from out of town

384
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,004
and getting him in town
and downtown and in here

385
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,799

what he saw and when he saw it.

386

01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,946
Yeah, they stop here.
They stop down there, too.

513
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,284
Am I bothering you?

514
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,912
- No, you ain't bothering me.
- Good.

515
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,873
But you're bothering me.

516
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,082
She's bothering you, Sonny?

517
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,835
Yeah, that's right,
this bitch is bothering me.

518
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,297
- What are you going to do about it?
- I'm going to break her fucking ass.

519
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,883
MAN: Hey, why break it
when we can fuck it first?

520
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,134
Hey, lady, where you going?

521
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,719
I don't want to crowd you guys.

522
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,888
Why are you down here
if you didn't want to crowd us?

523
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,306
Give me a break.

524
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,142
Hey, man, don't let her get away!
Get after her!

525
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,478
Come on, man.
Come on, catch her, man.

526
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,731
Shit! Get out of the way!

527
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,614
Take it easy, lady,
this ain't the rush hour.

528
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,824
Where the fuck are you guys
when somebody needs you?

529
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,075
I was almost attacked.

530
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:17,412
- When?
- Right here, now, by those punks.

531
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,509
I don't see nothing.

532
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,219
Well, they were right here.

533
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,305
I thought you said you were attacked...

534
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:45,023
There are, but there's this blonde
that's been following...

535
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,193
Oh, forget it.

536
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:20,035
(SHOUTING)

537
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,501
(SCREAMING)

538
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,462
Let's get the fuck out of here!

539
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,068
The blonde must be
one of Elliott's patients.

540
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,570
I was unloading my camera
when I saw her come out of his office

541
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:38,822
and I followed her to you.

542
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,615
What was that stuff you sprayed on her?

543
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,117
It's a kind of Mace I made at home.

544
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,244
It's a pretty simple compound
of sodium...

545
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:48,123
Save the Mr. Wizard lecture,
I wouldn't know sodium from Adam.

546
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,416
It sure worked.

547
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,003
It's temporary blindness.
It only lasts about ten seconds.

548
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,926
Saved my life.

549
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,386
I know.

550
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,888
I wish I had saved Mom's.

551
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,102
You liked your mom a lot, didn't you?

552
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,398
Yeah.

553
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,776
I miss her.

554
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,367
You want some more Coke?

555
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,495
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

556
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,747
How do you like my painting?

557
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,088
It's... very nice.

558
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,425
I bought it a couple of years ago
for $500.

559
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,595
It's really a great investment.

560
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:47,974
I mean, ten years from now,
it could be worth... a million dollars.

561
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,395
More if the artist dies, of course.

562
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,526
- Good luck with it.
- Thanks.

563
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,779
Doesn't your father wonder
where you are?

564
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:04,115
He's not my father. He's my stepfather.

565
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,452
I told him I am staying at my friend
Paul's, and he'll cover for me.

566
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,329
I'll take you home tomorrow.

567
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:12,123
I don't want to go home.
Miss Blake, I've got some pictures...

568
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,249
Call me Liz, OK?

569
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,460
Liz, I've got some pictures
of that blonde

570
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,462
from a camera I hid
outside Elliott's office.

571
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:21,299
Now, we gotta get in, get Elliott's
appointment book, and get her name.

572
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,719
That's what the police are for.
Come on, let's talk to Marino.

573
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,388
Fine, you talk to Marino.
I'm going to find out the blonde's name.

574
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,935
Who do you think you are, Superman?
You're just a kid, for God's sake.

575
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,479
Yeah, I'm the kid that saved your life.

576
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:43,821
All right, look,
let me talk to Marino.

577
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,408
If he cops out, then I'll help you.

578
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:54,290
OK, but you can't mention my name.

579
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,875
Mike would kill me.

580
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,879
I'm supposed to be...
studying for a French exam.

581
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,842
Well, your friend's covering
for you tonight, right?

582
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,764
Well, I'm your friend, too,
and I'll be the best cover you ever had.

583
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:12,558
OK.

584
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,645
You sure you going to be OK here?

585
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:16,854
Fine.

586
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,483
Well... Here you go.

587
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,278
- Good night.
- Good night.

588
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,617
Hey, Marino, I gotta talk to you.

589
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,119
- Mr. Out-of-Town turn up?
- No.

590
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,996
Then you better send
for your overnight bags.

591
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,540
Hey, come on,
you know I didn't kill that woman.

592
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,958
You're still my best bet.

593
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,462
For your information,
she tried to kill me last night.

594
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,798
Really?

595
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,175
Is that supposed to be concern
in your voice?

596
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:49,971
I take a professional interest
in our citizens knocking each other off.

597
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,223
Where did this happen?

598
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,225
She followed me from the Sheraton
into the subway.

599
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,686
I thought I lost her,
but she was waiting when I got home.

600
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,813
- She tried to slash me.
- Any witnesses to this one?

601
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,023
- Yes.
- Who?

602
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,696
- I can't tell you.
- Out of town again?

603
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,324
No, I just promised
I wouldn't say anything.

604
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,493
You know, this has
a familiar ring to it.

605
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,246
Look, Marino, I'm not interested
in your wiseass remarks.

606
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,998
Someone's trying to kill me,
and I need help.

607
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,959
I'll help you. I got a nice cell.
You'll be very safe in it.

608
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,252
Hey, Eddie.

609
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,670
Hey, wait a minute. Look.

610
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,256
I know the murderer is
one of Elliott's patients.

611
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,592
- How do you know that?
- Because she came out of his office.

612
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,385
Did you see her?

613
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,806
Well, no, not exactly.
But I know she came out.

614
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:36,017
You got to get in there,
get his appointment book.

615
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,310
Her name's got to be in it.

616
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,271
I hope you make a better hooker
than you do a detective.

617
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,775
I thought about Elliott's appointment
book a long time ago.

618
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,068
- So?
- So...

619
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:48,946
You can’t just walk into some shrink's
joint and start going through his books.

620
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,741
You need a search warrant.
And judges take a long time

621
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:54,702
before they let you start snooping
around some shrink's office.

622
01:12:56,789 --> 01:13:01,459
Of course, that wouldn't prevent
a paranoid murder suspect

623
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,795
from breaking in.

624
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,508
You know, searching for some evidence
to defend her case.

625
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:11,302
Oh, I get it.
You want me to break in for you.

626
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,139
I don't want you to do anything illegal.
You can quote me on that.

627
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:20,228
But I'm booking you tomorrow.
You got it? Tomorrow.

628
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:43,709
I'm Dr. Levy.

629
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,878
How do you do? I'm Dr. Elliott.

630
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,508
What can I do for you, Dr. Elliott?

631
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,469
You're seeing a patient of mine.

632
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:54,929
That's right.

633
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,556
I believe she's dangerous.

634
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,641
Really? In what way?

635
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,685
She's causing me trouble
because I wouldn't approve

636
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,061
her sex-change operation.

637
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,772
What kind of trouble has she caused you?

638
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,567
She's threatened me several times
over the phone.

639
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:11,529
- She also stole my razor.
- Why would she do that?

640
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,366
Doctor, did you read about the woman
who was slashed to death in an elevator?

641
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,326
It was on the front page,
I could hardly miss...

642
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,871
Kate Miller, the victim, was my patient.

643
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,541
You don't think that Bobbi
had anything to do with that?

644
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:27,044
My razor's gone.
Kate Miller was killed with a razor.

645
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,672
Nobody else could have taken it?

646
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,468
Doctor, I am not paranoid.
Bobbi has threatened me over the phone.

647
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,219
She said she was going to hurt me.

648
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:38,055
My patient was slashed to death,
and my razor's gone.

649
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:41,559
Now you don't have to be a detective
to figure it out, do you?

650
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:46,147
Come with me, and...
we'll talk to the police.

651
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,773
I've already been to the police.

652
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,777
But I didn't tell them about Bobbi.
I wanted to talk to her first.

653
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:54,572
I wanted to be absolutely sure
that it was her.

654
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,074
But she wouldn't return my calls.

655
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,243
I was hoping you'd be able to help.

656
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,704
Yes, I'll help.

657
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,998
I'll talk to her.

658
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,084
If I agree with your diagnosis,
we'll go to the police.

659
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,336
Thank you.

660
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:10,796
Please let me know what happens.

661
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:13,257
Do you know why Bobbi came to see me
in the first place?

662
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,092
No.

663
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:23,392
Why don't we go to my office,
and we'll try to get in touch with her.

664
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,020
I am late for an appointment now.

665
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:29,023
Why don't you call me at my office
when you've reached her.

666
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,274
All right.

667
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,652
You sure you'll be at your office?

668
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,237
Yes, I'm sure.

669
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:36,614
I'll call you there.

670
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,127
Peter Miller, I left some Super-8 film.

671
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,088
There's four dollars there.

672
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,144
PETER: I timed Elliott's patients
coming out of his office,

673
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:08,646
and the fastest was eight seconds.

674
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,606
So I set my camera to go off
every four seconds

675
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,276
so I'd be sure to get a good shot
of everybody.

676
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:31,085
- That's her.
- LIZ: She must be his last appointment.

677
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,170
We got to get a look in that book.

678
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:37,675
Yeah, I know. Marino wants it, too.
Only, I can get it for him faster.

679
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,178
No legal red tape, just my ass.

680
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:45,057
Look, I'll get it, nobody cares about
my ass. I'm just a grief-struck kid.

681
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,560
Yeah, but what a kid.

682
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,940
Okay, I got an idea.

683
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,862
It was very nice of you to see...

684
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,201
It was nice of you to see me so soon.

685
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,913
I try to keep my nights open
for returning phone calls

686
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,625
or in case a patient
needs some extra help.

687
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:13,919
I was worried about you.

688
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,506
You've had a terrible experience.

689
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:20,843
I know.

690
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:23,095
I didn't realize...

691
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:26,182
But I've been having
these terrible nightmares.

692
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,855
What were they about?

693
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:35,483
Well...

694
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,028
I have to get a cigarette.

695
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,659
I'm in this house that I've never
been to before, visiting a friend.

696
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:50,623
He's not there.

697
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:57,171
I'm watching TV...
and the doorbell rings.

698
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,383
It's a man.

699
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:04,261
He's big, dark.

700
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,267
He says his car broke down,
and he needs to use the phone.

701
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,105
I believe him and let him in...

702
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,526
...although I know something's wrong.

703
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:26,784
He closes the door, locks it,
and takes out a razor.

704
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,247
He says he's not going to hurt me.

705
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:40,506
Then he tells me...
what he's going to do to me...

706
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,219
...and how much I'm going to like it.

707
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,889
All the time he's talking,

708
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,809
I can see the bulge in his pants.

709
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:55,938
He orders me to strip.

710
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,484
I do it,
keeping one eye on the razor.

711
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,364
He drops his pants...

712
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:10,286
...forces me down, on my stomach.

713
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:15,374
He spreads my legs,
kneels down behind me...

714
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,170
...and rests the cold blade.

715
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,727
Forcing it.

716
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,273
I'm sorry.

717
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,777
What's the matter?

718
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,695
It's just so dirty.

719
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,198
Why do you say that?

720
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,659
Look, I know what dirty is,
and this is dirty.

721
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,083
Well, why don't you just talk about it?

722
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,377
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.

723
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,047
It's very bad.

724
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:06,509
And you're talking to an expert on bad.

725
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:07,718
Oh, really?

726
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,888
Now what makes you such an expert?

727
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,432
Because I'm a hooker.

728
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,017
Ah.

729
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,272
And I have done most of the bad things
you just read about.

730
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:23,067
Do you like doing these things?

731
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,861
- Sometimes.
- What do you like about it?

732
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:28,823
I like to turn men on.

733
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:33,410
I must do a pretty good job
because they pay me a lot.

734
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,913
Do you ever have any sex
that's not paid for?

735
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,626
Is that a proposal?

736
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,337
No. It...

737
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:47,591
It's what we psychiatrists call
a question.

738
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,469
Yes.

739
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:51,804
"Yes" what?

740
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:55,015
Yes, I do. For men that turn me on.

741
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,227
What sort of men turn you on?

742
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,983
Mature, doctorly type.

743
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,569
Like you.

744
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,365
Are you sexually attracted to me?

745
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,451
Yes. Are you?

746
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:16,579
- Attracted to you?
- Mm-hm.

747
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,790
Yes.

748
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:24,169
But then,
this isn't a social visit, is it?

749
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:27,965
You've come here for help and my job
is to offer you emotional assistance.

750
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,176
How about some sexual assistance?

751
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:34,889
Do you want to fuck me?

752
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:38,225
- Oh, yes.
- Well, why don't you?

753
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,978
- Because I'm a doctor and...
- Fucked a lot of doctors.

754
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,105
- And I'm married.
- Fucked a lot of them, too.

755
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:44,732
Don't you think
we're getting off the point?

756
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,360
Do you mind if I take off my coat?

757
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,905
No.

759
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,418
And the rest, too?

760
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,673
Now, why would you want to do
a thing like that?

761
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:14,887
Well, because of the size of that cock
in your pants.

762
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:18,682
I don't think you're so married.

763
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,154
Well?

764
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:35,199
What do you think?

765
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,205
I think you're a very attractive woman.

766
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,501
Would you like to touch me?

767
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:50,714
Yes and no. Yes, because I'm...

768
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:52,174
Well, why don't you?

769
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,343
I told you why.

770
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:02,226
That's right. You're a married doctor.
I remember now.

771
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:05,729
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do?

772
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:09,525
Just because I happen to have
personal and professional ethics?

773
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,446
Look, Doc, I think you're kind of shy.

774
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,244
So... I'm going to go powder my nose

775
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,663
and when I come back,

776
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,542
I hope to find your clothes
right next to mine.

777
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:30,921
And if not, we can just get back
to the mind-fuck.

(GRUNTS)

779
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,170
Dr. Elliott?

780
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:26,972
Dr. Elliott?

781
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:31,560
Dr. Elliott?

782
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,566
You really are shy, aren't you?

783
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:39,109
- Liz!

(SOBBING)

788
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:14,246
So you had me followed?

789
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,956
That's right.

790
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,543
You've met Betty Luce, one of our best
young police... persons.

791
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,879
When I told you I was attacked
on the subway, you thought I was nuts.

792
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:26,133
Well, Detective Luce told me
she lost you at Columbus Circle.

793
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:30,220
I didn't figure there was another blonde
following you. I mean, who would?

794
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:33,974
Yeah, and you wrote me off as a girl
with an overactive imagination.

795
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,309
Yeah, something like that.

796
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:38,270
- And she followed me to Elliott's.
- That's right.

797
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:42,232
Thank God.
What's wrong with that guy, anyway?

798
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:44,192
- He was a transsexual.
- What?

799
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,069
A transsexual.

800
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:50,157
About to make the final step, but his
male side couldn't let him do it.

801
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,533
MARINO: Male side?

802
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,286
There was Dr. Elliott,

803
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,079
and there was Bobbi.

804
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:58,707
Bobbi came to me
to get psychiatric approval

805
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,417
for a sex-reassignment operation.

806
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:04,338
I thought he was unstable,
and Elliott confirmed my diagnosis.

807
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:07,507
Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.

808
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,218
The sex-change operation
was to resolve the conflict.

809
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:14,222
But as much as Bobbi tried to get it,

810
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,849
Elliott blocked it.

811
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:18,643
So Bobbi got even.

812
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,604
MARINO: By killing Mrs. Miller.

813
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:24,858
Yes, she aroused Elliott,
just as you did, Miss Blake.

814
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:28,278
You mean, when Elliott got turned on,
Bobbi took over?

815
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:32,115
Yes. It was like Bobbi's red alert.

816
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:35,660
Elliott's penis became erect
and Bobbi took control,

817
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:38,997
trying to kill anyone
that made Elliott masculinely sexual.

818
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:41,917
When Elliott came to my office,
it was the first time

819
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,252
I saw Bobbi's masculine self.

820
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,215
When he told me that he thought
Bobbi had killed Mrs. Miller,

821
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,966
he was confessing himself.

822
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,929
I immediately called Detective Marino.

823
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:58,225
So why the hell didn't you stop me
from going to Elliott's?

824
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:02,646
Why? Because I was at a football game
with my kids, that's why.

825
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:05,607
By the time I spoke with Dr. Levy,
you were already over there.

826
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:08,610
So you never really thought
I killed Mrs. Miller?

827
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:13,990
No. But I had to get into Elliott's
office to find out which weirdo did,

828
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:16,868
so I pressed you into service.

829
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:18,120
Are you kidding?

830
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:21,248
So I had Miss Luce there tailing you

831
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,792
to make sure
you didn't get into too much trouble.

832
01:30:25,878 --> 01:30:26,962
Thanks.

833
01:30:28,464 --> 01:30:33,009
Well, it's always wonderful
to be of some assistance to the police.

834
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:34,553
Are you kidding?

835
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,557
So what's going to happen to Elliott?

836
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,529
Well?

837
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:56,032
There's some men and women who think
they're born in the wrong body.

838
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,701
They're called transsexuals.

839
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,704
And all they want to do
is have their sex changed.

840
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,418
How do you do that?

841
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:09,045
Well, if you're a man
that wants to become a woman,

842
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,214
you take female hormones.

843
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:12,591
What do they do?

844
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:17,929
Well, your skin softens, you grow
breasts, and you don't get hard anymore.

845
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:22,767
Great.

846
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,438
You sure you want to know about this?

847
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:31,234
Yeah. It's giving me some wonderful
new ideas for a science project.

848
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:35,822
Instead of building a computer,
I could build a woman... out of me.

849
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:40,202
Great idea. In that case,
I'll give you all the details.

850
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:42,245
The next step is surgery.

851
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:46,166
Let me see if I can remember
the exact word that Levy told me.

852
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,084
Oh, yeah, a penectomy.

853
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,337
What's that?

854
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:55,175
You know, when they take your penis
and slice it down the middle.

855
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,054
Yeah, that's what I thought it was.

856
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:00,972
Then...

857
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:03,767
...castration...

858
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:09,564
...plastic reconstruction and
the formation of an artificial vagina.

859
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:13,026
A vaginoplasty, to those in the know.

860
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:17,781
And I thought Elliott
just put on a dress.

861
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:20,033
He did. And a wig, too.

862
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,203
But you see, that's no good in bed,
when you gotta take everything off.

863
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:25,413
What's going to happen to him now?

864
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:28,625
Well, first he has to recover
from the gun wound,

865
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:32,796
and then if he's ever sane enough
to get out of Bellevue, they'll try him.

866
01:32:33,464 --> 01:32:36,466
And guess who's the star witness.

867
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:37,551
You.

868
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:40,428
Right. Something
I'm really looking forward to.

869
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:46,518
Well, I think I'm going to stick
to my computer.

870
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,313
That sounds like a very good idea.

871
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,990
Look, Liz...
I gotta get home and get to work.

872
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,202
I'm going to miss having you on my tail.

873
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:07,038
It made me feel kind of safe.

874
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:11,710
Look, you want to come home with me?
I'd love the company.

875
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,337
Wouldn't Mike mind?

876
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:19,926
Well, Mike's out of town
on a business trip.

877
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,096
We got plenty of room.

878
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:26,016
Great. I could sure use the vacation.

879
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,854
Good. I'll get the check.
