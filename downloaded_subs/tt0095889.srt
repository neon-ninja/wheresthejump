1
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,095
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

2
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,189
Can you spell "parakeet"?

3
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:29,826
Parakeet.

4
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,563
B-I-R-D.

5
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,807
- Wrong. Try again.
- Wrong?

6
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:38,069
Wrong, Aunt Trish. Try again.

7
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,708
- What's for breakfast?
- My turn?

8
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:44,712
Darling, Donna has locked herself
in our bathroom.

9
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,648
Would you get her out of there?

10
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:49,744
- My favorite role, the wicked stepmother.
- Absolutely.

11
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:53,820
- It's chilly in here this morning.
- I'll check that.

12
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:57,259
- You making breakfast?
- Aunt Trish said it's my turn.

13
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,690
Shh with that "Aunt Trish" stuff.

14
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:03,260
I have been begging you since you got here
not to call her that.

15
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:07,396
- It's been a month already.
- Bruce, old habits die hard, you know.

16
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:11,542
- Right, they do.
- My mom always calls her Trish.

17
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:14,073
My grandma always called her Trish.

18
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:17,910
But Aunt Pat hates it.
She thinks it's déclassé.

19
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,912
Déclassé?

20
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,412
- Call her Pat, will you?
- I'll try.

21
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,081
- You want to help me make breakfast?
- I'd love to.

22
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:29,127
What does "déclassé" mean?

23
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,497
Come on.
I heard Mom and Pop called last night.

24
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,623
Yeah, they did.

25
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,435
Just a second.

26
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:42,269
We're gonna be late again,
and you still have to use my eyeliner...

27
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,808
which I have.

28
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,069
- Here.
- Thanks.

29
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,239
You look great.

30
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,509
Now remember, less is more.

31
00:04:57,022 --> 00:05:00,958
We got eggs, sausage, bacon, dill pickles.
What will it be?

32
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,925
Toast'ems.

33
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,725
No. Not again.

34
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,922
I cook. You set the table.

35
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,464
- Done.
- A masterpiece.

36
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:15,070
- A veritable Picasso.
- He would have put your nose over here.

37
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:18,366
Can I borrow this?

38
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:24,115
- You look like an Eskimo.
- I'm a California person.

39
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:26,013
I'm not used to wearing this stuff.

40
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,575
Listen, surfer girl,
the week before you got here...

41
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:31,918
the temperature got above zero
for about six minutes.

42
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,450
If it's this cold inside, you're gonna
appreciate those when you get outside.

43
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,055
Doesn't it ever get warm in Chicago?

44
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,191
You are going to regret
that remark come August, young lady.

45
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,259
August? I'm supposed to go home
before August.

46
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:49,406
If I had my way, I'd keep you here forever.

47
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:57,048
- What are you gonna wear tonight?
- Last year's salary.

48
00:05:57,215 --> 00:06:00,378
- It wasn't that expensive.
- Yeah?

49
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,847
- What are you gonna wear, Dad?
- My tux.

50
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:05,685
- The one you wore to your wedding?
- Yeah, that one.

51
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:10,091
- Fashion's never been your father's thing.
- It's a year old, dear.

52
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,630
I think he looks handsome
in his wedding pictures.

53
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:15,097
- There you are. The voice of sanity.
- I agree.

54
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,601
- Handsome, but conservative.
- I agree.

55
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,069
Wait a minute,
you're on my side, remember?

56
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:22,766
A woman's entitled to change her mind.

57
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,704
No, thanks. We'll take the next one.

58
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:35,779
- Who's driving me to work?
- Me.

59
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,878
Let's go.

60
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,499
All aboard.

61
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:54,333
Thank you, my lady.

62
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,575
Fasten your seat belts.

63
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,572
You better be careful, honey.

64
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:05,647
- Remember what happened to Narcissus.
- Who?

65
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:10,185
Greek mythology. He loved looking
at his reflection in a pond so much...

66
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:11,654
he fell in and drowned.

67
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,159
- Only a boy could be that clumsy.
- You got that right.

68
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,402
What's wrong?

69
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,065
Every new building has its problems.

70
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,975
We'll get those problems
before they get us, right?

71
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,009
Right?

72
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:52,988
Hold it, please!

73
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,621
- Bye, honey.
- Have a good day.

74
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,592
- Thanks for the lift.
- 'Bye, Dad.

75
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,127
'Morning, Gene. How you doing?

76
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,996
- 'Morning, Bruce.
- 'Morning.

77
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,693
- 'Morning, Mr. Gardner.
- 'Morning. What's with the heat?

78
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,077
- 'Morning, Mr. Gardner.
- 'Morning. What's with the heat?

79
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,045
I'm checking it now.
Probably a thermo on the fritz.

80
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:47,346
Get it fixed and have somebody check out
Freight Elevator 15. It's got a stutter in it.

81
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:48,680
15? Sure.

82
00:08:58,096 --> 00:08:59,188
Wait up!

83
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,902
Great! I don't have to go
to that creepy school today.

84
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,035
Oh, no.

85
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,842
Come on, we'll cut them off at the pass.

86
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:28,084
Our 50 elevators will be carrying...

87
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,424
approximately 12,000 passengers a day...

88
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:35,125
swiftly and conveniently,
to our many shops, offices...

89
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,429
condominiums, and restaurants.

90
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:39,330
Come on!

91
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:47,539
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to a glimpse of the future.

92
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:48,704
Taxi!

93
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:55,212
It's hotter than Hell out here.

94
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:57,878
There they are.

95
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,794
Look, there's that snot Donna
and her yucky little cousin.

96
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:07,524
- They're late again.
- Cool it, Marcie.

97
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,268
Hi, Donna.

98
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,700
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Your turn on Monday.

99
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,748
You get two fun-filled weeks
to pilot the Enterprise.

100
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,284
- Two weeks?
- Two kids, two weeks.

101
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,377
- Just like me.
- Come on, Mom. We're going to be late.

102
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,954
- Okay.
- 'Bye.

103
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:53,337
In fact, we like to think we are a city,
a safe, efficient metropolis...

104
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:56,712
that will take us into the 21st century.

105
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,794
Hi, Mary.

106
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,893
Konnichiwa.

107
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,007
Did you forget to pay the heating bill?
It's freezing here.

108
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,874
I know, it's strange. It's warmer outside.

109
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,341
Why are they moving the Tods?

110
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:33,781
Takamitsu doesn't want them
intermingling with his work, darling.

111
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,614
Is he going to be responsible...

112
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:39,281
for $26,000 worth
of postmodern neo-abstraction?

113
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:41,518
You're the one who gave him carte blanche.

114
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,890
Is everything set?
Caterers, brochures, music?

115
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:47,158
Everything is set.
Calm down, go sit down and relax.

116
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:48,892
Nothing is gonna go wrong.

117
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,606
- Not over there!
- That's where he told us to put it.

118
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:03,478
- Take it easy.
- Watch it!

119
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:05,009
Got it!

120
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,879
It's okay. We got it.

121
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,681
Nothing's going to go wrong.

122
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,433
- You're coming to my party tonight?
- I don't think so.

123
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,068
- How come?
- She can't come to our party tonight.

124
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:35,840
She has to stay upstairs
and take care of Carol Anne.

125
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:40,077
Because her mother's having her own party
tonight. I heard her mother tell Mom.

126
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:44,349
- It's my party, not ours.
- Listen, mouth, Pat's not my mother.

127
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:47,687
And if I wanted to come
to your brother's party, I could.

128
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:07,706
- You got a second?
- Yeah, what's up, Nate?

129
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,769
Come here, let me show you something.

130
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,609
All right. Where are we going?

131
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,858
What? Somebody broke the mirror.
Replace it.

132
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:32,665
Not just this panel. Every panel from
the concourse all the way up to the top.

133
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:37,974
You guys have to see this.

134
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,687
Ice.

135
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:03,256
Now, how the hell could that happen?

136
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,602
I kind of hoped you'd tell us, Mr. Gardner.

137
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,667
Sally, call the heating
and air conditioning contractor.

138
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:19,409
Tell Stan to get to my office
with a schematic for the ventilation system.

139
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,111
- Pronto.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Gardner.

140
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,537
How come you go to
the Seaton school for weirdoes?

141
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:48,271
It's for smart kids, not weirdoes.

142
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,280
That's why you don't go there.

143
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,176
- There she is.
- Yeah, okay.

144
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:05,629
Thank you, Mrs. Moyer.

145
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,863
- Seen any ghosts lately?
- Leave her alone.

146
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,994
- You a cop or something?
- Watch it, you little asshole.

147
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,528
Shut the door.

148
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,110
You're so déclassé.

149
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:36,918
Damn.

150
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:43,592
Yeah, I know.
The kids have started teasing her.

151
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,295
I was hoping we could keep her ghosts
in my closet.

152
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:49,896
This doesn't make my job any easier.

153
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:53,702
- That's why you get the big bucks, Doc.
- Funny, Deborah.

154
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,641
- You could call in an exorcist.
- Funnier.

155
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,665
I'm really sorry
you're not coming to the party.

156
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:22,365
I kind of hoped...

157
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,398
you were.

158
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:27,967
Scott, my knight in shining acne.

159
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,342
Shut up, and leave them alone.

160
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,615
Maybe we could catch a movie
tomorrow night.

161
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,342
Maybe. Call me.

162
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,455
He's still panting.

163
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:47,224
I wish Dusty would pant that way for me.

164
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,788
Jeff's constantly in heat.

165
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:52,063
I practically have to muzzle him every night.
It's a real drag.

166
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,434
Maybe he could give Dusty ideas?

167
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:58,835
- I don't know if you could handle it.
- It'll be totally radical to try.

168
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:01,746
Get a grip, girls.

169
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:11,315
This...

170
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:14,955
is the Second Piano Concerto by Chopin.

171
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:21,354
I'll bet all of you probably think...

172
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:25,634
this was written by some old geezer
who looked like Dr. Seaton.

173
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,069
Well, it wasn't. In fact...

174
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:36,003
Freddy Chopin composed this
when he was only 19 years old...

175
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:39,579
and he'd already written a lot.

176
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,817
He'd been playing by ear
and making up tunes since he was 6.

177
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,452
At 8...

178
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,756
he had written
his first of several polonaises.

179
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:54,696
And at the ripe old age of 12...

180
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:58,034
he was asked to play for the Czar of Russia.

181
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:03,804
Pretty scary, even for an old-timer of 12.

182
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:14,146
In this school, where we're dealing with
gifted children with emotional problems...

183
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,845
we have to open them up.

184
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,854
So, we make them aware of the fact...

185
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:21,221
that other famous child prodigies
shared similar problems.

186
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,386
It makes them comfortable
to know they're not that different.

187
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:28,091
These kids are about to find out
that Chopin was crippled by shyness...

188
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,101
- And used music to overcome it.
- Excuse me, Dr. Seaton...

189
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:35,503
that little blonde girl keeps staring
at the mirror as if she sees us.

190
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:40,373
- Do you think she can?
- No.

191
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:43,547
But you think she's staring straight at you?

192
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:49,919
That is one of her dubious talents,
making people believe things.

193
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,918
- Has she ever...
- Let's talk in the hall.

194
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:14,637
She's a very interesting case,
our Carol Anne.

195
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,546
Reasonably well-balanced,
extremely intelligent...

196
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:21,347
IQ well into the 150s,
and one hell of an imagination.

197
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,282
- Most bright kids do.
- True...

198
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:27,724
but even the brightest ones allow adults
to intimidate them back to reality.

199
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,522
"Dad, there's a purple cow in our yard".

200
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:33,256
"What, are you nuts? Get out of here".

201
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,494
But Carol Anne's different
than most of our other geniuses.

202
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:39,401
She seems able to project her imagination...

203
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,736
convince others that
the purple cow in the yard is real.

204
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,540
Apparently, she actually convinced
an entire neighborhood that it was haunted.

205
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,277
There's a talent.

206
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:52,373
You think she's able to create
some sort of mass hysteria?

207
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,977
No, not really. It's more like mass hypnosis.

208
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:00,819
As I work with her, try to work with her,
the child's impossible...

209
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:05,659
the more I'm convinced she actually might
be capable of inducing mass hypnosis.

210
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:09,222
- Have you put her under?
- Only once. It was terrifying.

211
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:11,163
- For her?
- For both of us.

212
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,171
I started to experience what she was seeing.

213
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,132
My God.

214
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,137
He found her.

215
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,779
I'm sorry. Stay and finish your tea.

216
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:57,705
I've got to go.

217
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:06,651
Mommy, where are you? I can't see you!
Where are you?

218
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:09,961
He's after me, Mommy! I'm scared!

219
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:12,622
Yes, I am ready!

220
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:15,222
I can't find you! He's getting closer!

221
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,358
Who?

222
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:19,194
The man! The ugly man!

223
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:22,299
I've got you, Carol Anne. You're safe.

224
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:27,172
You're in your room in Cuesta Verde.
You're safe.

225
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:29,106
Everything's calm.

226
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,386
Tell me about what's just happened.

227
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:50,233
The man wanted me
to lead him into the light.

228
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:54,035
It's so cold there. I heard them talking.

229
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:57,102
He said it was my daddy's fault
because of the houses...

230
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:00,008
the houses my daddy built on their graves.

231
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,774
He said I had to lead them into the light.
Into the light.

232
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:07,610
- Why do you have to lead them?
- I was born in that house.

233
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:13,116
- Robbie! The tree's eating Robbie!
- Sleep.

234
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,427
I'm going to count to three.

235
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,037
And when I snap my fingers,
you will awaken.

236
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:30,707
You will not remember any of this.

237
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,035
One...

238
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:33,604
two...

239
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:35,339
three.

240
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,175
How do you feel?

241
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:41,844
Okay.

242
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,750
One word.

243
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,690
How do you feel deep down inside?

244
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,755
One word.

245
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,462
I don't know.

246
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:55,855
Lonely, maybe.

247
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,634
Lonely?

248
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,571
Sure, why not?

249
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:13,009
It gets lonely being away from home,
doesn't it?

250
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,676
Yeah. Aunt...

251
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,981
Pat and Bruce and Donna are real nice,
but I miss my mom and dad.

252
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:21,787
And even my brother.

253
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:35,065
That's very good.

254
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,236
- What?
- The way you made me look in the mirror.

255
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,368
I didn't make you look at anything.

256
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:42,936
That's what he meant, manipulation.

257
00:23:43,414 --> 00:23:45,746
What were you looking at
that made me turn?

258
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,045
Nothing.

259
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,549
You were looking at something.

260
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,883
I don't want to talk about it.

261
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:56,484
When you talk about things
that bother you, they go away.

262
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,086
No, if you talk about things, they happen.

263
00:23:59,164 --> 00:24:00,825
Who told you that?

264
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:02,694
Go away!

265
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:17,806
Are you all right?

266
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:26,916
What happened? What broke the mirror?

267
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:34,059
A little demonstration in mass hypnosis.

268
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,961
She made me believe I saw a coffee mug...

269
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:39,469
fly off my desk into the mirror...

270
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:42,606
while giving you a suggestion to smash it.

271
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,497
Beautiful sight, isn't it?

272
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:21,675
Did I ever tell you
how to make a little girl laugh?

273
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,679
I never did?

274
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:26,141
It takes a lot of practice.

275
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:28,815
The first thing you got to do...

276
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:31,954
is tickle right here in the ribs.

277
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:37,762
Don't worry about
that seven years' bad luck stuff.

278
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:39,556
That's old wives' tales.

279
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,064
- I didn't break it.
- I believe you.

280
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,298
But I'll tell you a secret.

281
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:47,496
If that old nerd were my doctor,
I would have done it.

282
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:49,436
I didn't. He did.

283
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:51,301
Dr. Seaton?

284
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:57,003
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

285
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:30,640
How's Carol Anne?

286
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:33,116
I don't know.

287
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,654
How would you feel if some quack told you
you had supernatural powers?

288
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:43,520
Do you remember that guy
who was on all the talk shows?

289
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:46,859
What was his name?
He was from Israel or someplace.

290
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:49,559
He used to bend keys, fix watches...

291
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,224
took Polaroids of himself in the dark.

292
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:53,998
Maybe Carol Anne...

293
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:55,901
Please, not you, too.

294
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:57,934
Give the kid a break, please.

295
00:26:58,008 --> 00:27:00,875
First your crazy brother-in-law
uses her as a scapegoat...

296
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:03,470
for those $250,000
collapsible homes he builds...

297
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:06,209
- Steven didn't...
- Steven and your sister have put...

298
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:10,549
that poor thing through hell, with
those weirdo psychics and witch doctors.

299
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:14,382
Weirdo psychics and witch doctors!
Come on!

300
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,222
Darling, you are the only sane person
in your family.

301
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,824
Please.

302
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,663
Don't let that pompous-ass shrink...

303
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:28,865
tell you she's Carrie or Houdini
or some damn thing like that.

304
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:33,031
Nobody really knows
what happened there this afternoon.

305
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:37,574
Maybe we shouldn't leave
the girls here alone tonight.

306
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:40,640
Maybe we should forget
the opening altogether.

307
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,543
Don't be stupid.

308
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,855
We're both being stupid.
You have opening night jitters...

309
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,518
- I have a building falling apart.
- Exactly.

310
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:54,087
We needed my sister pressuring us to take
her kid like we needed a hole in the head.

311
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:57,463
I really don't mind
a house full of beautiful women.

312
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:01,630
- The more the merrier.
- Then hire us a maid.

313
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:04,698
Swedish, about 24?

314
00:28:05,776 --> 00:28:09,576
- 5'2"? Talk about pressure.
- Will you go get dressed?

315
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,171
What did I say?

316
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:30,630
Hi, sweetie. Can I have a good night kiss?

317
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,767
All set.

318
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:39,304
- Have a good night's sleep.
- Good night.

319
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:40,671
Be right with you.

320
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:48,010
She's got the hots for him. I'm serious.
I see her every single day.

321
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:50,815
Look for her at the start of the day.
I'm dead serious.

322
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:53,722
She follows him all the time. Yeah, what?

323
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,692
Will you do me a favor?

324
00:28:56,227 --> 00:28:59,219
- No ghost stories tonight, all right?
- Gotcha.

325
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,967
- Good night.
- 'Bye.

326
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,469
My dad.
I don't know what he's talking about.

327
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,301
Not bad at all.

328
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,811
Forget it.

329
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,614
However, after the opening...

330
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,897
I know it's going to be a great party,
but I can't come.

331
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,234
No, I'm brat-sitting.
She's not even a relative.

332
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,508
She's sort of a relative, but not really.

333
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,774
Yeah, if Scott wants to call me
from the party...

334
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:54,614
I might talk to him.

335
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:00,949
'Bye.

336
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:05,723
- What you doing?
- Eavesdropping.

337
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,859
- Why don't you go to Martin's party?
- You know I can't.

338
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,630
I'll cover for you, they'll never know.

339
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,564
If I get caught, we'll be in trouble.

340
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,403
I can take the heat.

341
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:22,505
I didn't mean
what I said to Sandy on the phone.

342
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:26,573
I don't mind being "sort of a relative".
As long as we're friends.

343
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:28,110
Good.

344
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:07,422
There are some people over here
I'd like you to meet.

345
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:26,233
It looks like the show is a success, darling.

346
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:31,475
- Like the art. Love the sushi.
- It's nice to see you.

347
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,279
Excuse me, Pat, come here,
I've got to talk to you.

348
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,717
Hello, Mary.

349
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,514
- Are you trying to save money on the heat?
- I wish that were the case. New equipment.

350
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:44,084
- Trying to work out the bugs and all that.
- Good to see you.

351
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,738
- You look great.
- Anne Klein II.

352
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:59,777
Remember, less is more.

353
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:04,772
You look great.

354
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,555
Maybe I ought to stay home
with you tonight.

355
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:17,857
Just go already. I'll be fine.

356
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:33,299
How come you're taking
your dad's passkey?

357
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:37,314
I'm gonna use the emergency stairs
so nobody sees me in the elevator.

358
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:39,748
You got Martin's number, right?

359
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:41,614
- I won't stay long.
- Have fun.

360
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,715
- Be good.
- I will.

361
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:25,226
- What's the matter? Is the stereo broken?
- It's my parents.

362
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:28,094
- Thought they weren't gonna be home.
- Tell me about it.

363
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:32,728
My father's not well, and my mom says
if she can hear the party, it's over.

364
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:37,173
I thought you couldn't come.
Couldn't stay away from hot Scott?

365
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:40,507
Back to your cage. It's feeding time.

366
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:44,871
- $50 and she's history.
- You're on!

367
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:56,088
Hi there.

368
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:59,490
I can't believe
I risked getting into trouble for this.

369
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:03,135
I bet we could find some trouble.
Your parents aren't home.

370
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,896
Sounds great.
How many bedrooms have you got?

371
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:08,464
- Shut up.
- Carol Anne's up there.

372
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,405
Is anything open in the galleria?

373
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:13,103
Forget it, didn't bring my fake ID.

374
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,144
My stepmom's having a party there.
I can't go.

375
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:19,615
You're a real killjoy tonight, aren't you?

376
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:23,120
- Isn't there a pool in this building?
- It's locked at night.

377
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,382
But...

378
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,791
G-O-R...

379
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:34,928
I-L-L-A.

380
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,501
That is correct.

381
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:40,538
Can you spell "pheasant"?

382
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:42,903
P-H...

383
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,634
We're back!

384
00:35:45,503 --> 00:35:47,664
- Leave me alone!
- I've got you!

385
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:49,206
Let go of me!

386
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:56,204
You can't get away. I've got you.

387
00:35:57,549 --> 00:35:59,312
You can't get away!

388
00:36:09,394 --> 00:36:11,123
You can't get away.

389
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:15,097
We need you.

390
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:19,301
Come here, Carol Anne.

391
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:24,535
Closer.

392
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,910
You can't get away. I've got you!

393
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:35,051
I've got you!

394
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,485
Break the mirror.

395
00:36:37,055 --> 00:36:38,682
Break the mirror.

396
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:46,120
No!

397
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:02,802
Hello?

398
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:08,281
- Who is this?
- Carol Anne needs your help.

399
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,751
Kane found her, and it's all your fault.

400
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:17,589
Carol Anne, are you on this line?
This is one of your little pranks?

401
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:19,087
Hello?

402
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:27,662
- Who was that?
- A pest.

403
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:31,841
Bruce Gardner, please, on Michigan Avenue.

404
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,368
My little pest from the west
playing her little tricks.

405
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:37,645
Thank you.

406
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:45,252
Jesus Christ!

407
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:51,152
- What did that?
- It's not a what, it's a who.

408
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:54,689
I'm gonna nip that little prank
right in the bud.

409
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,028
Where are you going?

410
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:59,400
To that art gallery opening
we decided not to go to.

411
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,596
Put dinner on a low flame.

412
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,932
Don't forget the cilantro.

413
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:12,046
Hello, Mrs. Moyer? This is Carol Anne.

414
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,277
Is Donna there?

415
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:18,922
Are you sure?

416
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,984
Okay, thank you.

417
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:40,375
There's a camera in the hallway.

418
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:43,176
We'll go in twos. I'll tell you when to go.

419
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:46,412
Run under the camera
and stand against the door.

420
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:48,083
You ready?

421
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,249
Go!

422
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:03,528
Ready?

423
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:18,947
Get ready.

424
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,582
Let's go.

425
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:29,155
Hurry up!

426
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:44,265
Watch the camera. When the red light
goes off, go into the locker rooms.

427
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,210
- There's always suits on the clotheslines.
- Who needs a suit?

428
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:49,543
- You do!
- Come on.

429
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:15,060
Come on.

430
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:17,734
We need you.

431
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:39,717
Sam, the stairway alarm just went off on 70.

432
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:42,227
Anything on the monitor?

433
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:46,827
It looks like that camera ain't working either.

434
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:48,799
Better go check it out.

435
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,759
Come on.

436
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:58,069
You knock on the door, tell Burt
you saw some creepy guy walking on 67.

437
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,577
As soon as he leaves, we'll go in.

438
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:03,804
- He's coming out.
- Where's he going?

439
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,818
- He just got in the elevator.
- Wait.

440
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,347
Okay, let's go.

441
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:30,339
What are you gonna do?

442
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:32,803
Gonna run the videotape back two hours...

443
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:34,309
then I'm going to change the monitor
from camera to VCR.

444
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,741
then I'm going to change the monitor
from camera to VCR.

445
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:39,715
When he comes back in, he'll be watching
two hours of videotape on the monitor.

446
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:47,322
- Okay, let's go.
- Have you got a key for that?

447
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:53,360
- Yeah. Why?
- Beer.

448
00:42:53,997 --> 00:42:56,625
- I'm not going to steal...
- I got money.

449
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,998
- No way.
- Yes.

450
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:40,001
I'm your friend, Carol Anne.

451
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,898
We need you to lead us into the light.

452
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,677
Lead us into the light.

453
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:38,462
Come on.

454
00:44:39,703 --> 00:44:40,965
Let's go.

455
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:55,846
Come on.

456
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:17,100
Come on.

457
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:27,012
Want to see real panic?

458
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,580
Pretty impressive.

459
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:39,887
This is the police. We have you surrounded.

460
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:43,091
Come out with your hands up
and your pants down!

461
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:48,727
Hello, this is your camp director.
Jeff, quit pissing in the pool.

462
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:54,075
Scott had a girl

463
00:45:54,411 --> 00:45:57,107
And Donna was her name

464
00:45:58,181 --> 00:46:01,082
Donna, Donna

465
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:10,818
Shit!

466
00:46:19,036 --> 00:46:20,628
Don't be afraid.

467
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:23,800
We won't harm you.

468
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,107
We love you.

469
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:30,503
You are the only angel...

470
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:33,512
who can lead us into the light.

471
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,918
We would never hurt you.

472
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:37,913
Never!

473
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:40,422
Don't run away from me.

474
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:47,463
We need you, Carol Anne.
Lead us into the light.

475
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,921
Help me! Let go of me! Help!

476
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,661
Donna! Help!

477
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:31,731
Help me! Donna! Quick!

478
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:37,877
Holy shit!

479
00:47:37,948 --> 00:47:39,381
Donna, help!

480
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:47,456
- Just hold on!
- Please help me!

481
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:50,320
- Grab on to me!
- Donna, pull.

482
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:58,896
- Pull her! I got her!
- Hang on!

483
00:48:00,937 --> 00:48:03,303
- Pull her! Hold on!
- Help me!

484
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:10,045
Don't let go.

485
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:12,674
- Hold on to her!
- Pull!

486
00:48:13,784 --> 00:48:16,116
- Pull!
- Hang on!

487
00:48:16,486 --> 00:48:17,714
Hold on.

488
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,083
I love that! Love it! Yeah!

489
00:49:11,642 --> 00:49:13,872
Smoking more now and enjoying it less?

490
00:49:13,945 --> 00:49:16,106
Thinking more and enjoying it less.

491
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,774
- There's something wrong.
- Tell me about it.

492
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,944
Takamitsu offended
everyone he talked to tonight.

493
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:24,644
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner. I just got a call.

494
00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:27,452
There's a bunch of kids
partying up in the pool...

495
00:49:27,525 --> 00:49:30,358
who claim they're guests of your daughter.

496
00:49:30,995 --> 00:49:32,326
Excuse me.

497
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:46,209
Okay, so you all left the party together,
and they let you in here...

498
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:49,542
went to the security room
to turn off the camera...

499
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,673
- And then where did they go?
- I don't know where Scott and Donna went.

500
00:49:53,751 --> 00:49:56,584
We didn't hurt anything.
All we were doing was swimming.

501
00:49:56,654 --> 00:50:00,021
- Where was Carol Anne through all this?
- Not with us.

502
00:50:04,762 --> 00:50:07,424
Thanks, guys. Take the kids back to 56-E.

503
00:50:07,498 --> 00:50:11,025
- I'll talk with their parents later.
- Right, Mr. Gardner. Come on!

504
00:50:11,102 --> 00:50:14,094
My parents are going to ground me
till I'm 40.

505
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:16,035
It'll give you time to study.

506
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:19,372
You might get something
besides Auto Shop this year.

507
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:26,373
- They got Donna.
- Who's got Donna?

508
00:51:26,443 --> 00:51:30,038
- They got Donna and Carol Anne.
- Who's got Carol Anne?

509
00:51:30,113 --> 00:51:32,240
- They got them.
- Who, damn it?

510
00:51:39,189 --> 00:51:42,352
- What happened?
- He just came up through the ice.

511
00:51:43,494 --> 00:51:45,621
- What ice?
- The ice in the...

512
00:51:47,598 --> 00:51:48,690
pool.

513
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:56,895
She's gotten to you, too.
It's a suggestion, Mr. Gardner.

514
00:51:57,441 --> 00:51:59,466
A posthypnotic suggestion.

515
00:51:59,877 --> 00:52:03,313
They got them. They got Donna,
and they got Carol Anne.

516
00:52:03,647 --> 00:52:06,343
They got them both. They've got them.

517
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:30,702
Aunt Trish, help me!

518
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,946
She's mine!

519
00:52:46,823 --> 00:52:48,757
Please help me.

520
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:50,258
Help me!

521
00:52:52,763 --> 00:52:55,061
- Help me!
- Hang on, I'm pulling!

522
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:57,261
Hang on.

523
00:53:07,044 --> 00:53:08,511
I've got you.

524
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:10,778
Hold on!

525
00:53:11,248 --> 00:53:12,340
Help!

526
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:21,814
Hold on, Carol Anne! We've got you!

527
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:23,251
Pull!

528
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,392
- Grab hold of her!
- I've got her.

529
00:53:29,466 --> 00:53:31,661
Pull! Don't let go!

530
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:38,769
Get away!

531
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:44,204
That's not Carol Anne!

532
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:46,577
Damn you!

533
00:53:54,157 --> 00:53:55,488
Stay back.

534
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:59,290
He's got the girls and now he wants you.

535
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,224
- What are you talking about?
- The preacher Kane.

536
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:06,998
He knows as long as there's someone
on this side that loves them...

537
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,935
you can get them back.

538
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:12,002
How did you know that wasn't Carol Anne?

539
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:15,068
What surprised me, dear...

540
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:17,441
is that you didn't.

541
00:54:20,017 --> 00:54:21,814
Who the hell are you?

542
00:54:23,987 --> 00:54:26,478
I'm one of your brother-in-law's...

543
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:28,649
weirdo psychics.

544
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:34,796
Carol Anne and Donna are not in that room.

545
00:54:38,168 --> 00:54:40,966
- Some goddamned thing is.
- Yes.

546
00:54:41,638 --> 00:54:44,436
Anger, rage...

547
00:54:45,509 --> 00:54:48,273
evil, they are in that room.

548
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:50,844
Can you feel the cold?

549
00:54:51,048 --> 00:54:54,745
He's devouring the heat, the energy.

550
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,046
He's gathering his strength.

551
00:54:58,422 --> 00:55:01,721
We must find the girls
before he becomes too strong.

552
00:55:02,225 --> 00:55:05,490
If Donna and Carol Anne aren't in that room,
then where are they?

553
00:55:06,463 --> 00:55:07,987
The other side.

554
00:55:08,632 --> 00:55:13,126
Before we can find the girls,
we must find out where they entered.

555
00:55:15,105 --> 00:55:17,767
Where did Dr. Rasputin...

556
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,406
take Scott?

557
00:55:21,445 --> 00:55:23,310
Excuse me, Dr. Seaton?

558
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:27,180
Excuse us.

559
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:36,859
Do your stuff.

560
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:49,269
I want you to look at the light.

561
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:52,502
Look at the light.

562
00:56:06,957 --> 00:56:09,357
- Security.
- Burt, this is Gardner.

563
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,321
Get your guys together. My daughter
and niece are roaming the building...

564
00:56:13,396 --> 00:56:16,593
and I'd like them found
as soon as possible, okay?

565
00:56:18,602 --> 00:56:19,694
What?

566
00:56:21,204 --> 00:56:22,432
Damn it!

567
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:24,938
Yeah, okay.

568
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,272
Terrific.

569
00:56:29,746 --> 00:56:32,909
First the heating,
then the electrical problems...

570
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,875
now the security monitors.

571
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:40,212
This is really happening, isn't it?

572
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,781
Depends on who you want to believe.

573
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:48,297
Tweedledum or Tweedle-dumber.

574
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:59,569
You and Donna are at the swimming pool.

575
00:57:00,977 --> 00:57:02,501
You're leaving.

576
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:04,475
Where are you going?

577
00:57:05,982 --> 00:57:07,643
The security room.

578
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,751
We saw Carol Anne on the monitor.

579
00:57:11,555 --> 00:57:13,045
Which monitor?

580
00:57:13,957 --> 00:57:15,822
She was in the garage.

581
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:19,760
The puddle!

582
00:57:20,831 --> 00:57:23,026
Hands came out of the puddle!

583
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,693
They grabbed us, the hands!

584
00:57:27,037 --> 00:57:28,902
Keep her away from me!

585
00:57:36,279 --> 00:57:37,678
What puddle?

586
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:46,345
In the garage.

587
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:16,846
They're between dimensions...

588
00:58:17,454 --> 00:58:19,251
behind reflections...

589
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:22,514
behind mirrors, stealing images.

590
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:34,569
The light!

591
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:40,942
The light, it's so cold!

592
00:58:43,681 --> 00:58:45,148
Listen to me.

593
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,741
Find your way back to your room.

594
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:50,049
You must go back to your room.

595
00:58:51,356 --> 00:58:52,948
He won't let me!

596
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:55,052
I'm so cold!

597
00:58:57,161 --> 00:59:00,324
Find Donna and go back to your room. Run!

598
00:59:00,398 --> 00:59:03,424
Enough. Stop this stupid sideshow.

599
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:08,304
It's a great act. Carol Anne creates the fire,
and you feed it.

600
00:59:08,906 --> 00:59:10,703
You made this happen.

601
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:14,233
You made her talk about him,
you made her remember him.

602
00:59:14,445 --> 00:59:17,380
He was lost. You brought him here.

603
00:59:17,982 --> 00:59:19,313
Ludicrous.

604
00:59:20,585 --> 00:59:22,314
It's your choice...

605
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:25,046
Tweedledum...

606
00:59:25,456 --> 00:59:27,890
or Tweedle-dumber.

607
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:35,660
Tell us what to do.

608
00:59:37,635 --> 00:59:40,763
Pray that Carol Anne heard me and listens.

609
00:59:41,406 --> 00:59:44,102
We must get up there as fast as we can.

610
00:59:47,111 --> 00:59:51,172
This is stupid, idiotic!
What's the matter with you people?

611
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:53,444
Can't you see Carol Anne's behind this?

612
00:59:53,518 --> 00:59:56,817
She's making us believe this is happening.
It's all a hypnotic...

613
00:59:56,888 --> 00:59:58,378
That's as stupid and idiotic...

614
00:59:58,456 --> 01:00:01,084
as you hypnotizing that coffee cup
through the mirror.

615
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:17,606
That's good.

616
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:21,077
He'll try to trick you.

617
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:23,504
He'll try to separate you.

618
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:25,405
Don't let him.

619
01:00:25,483 --> 01:00:27,781
Your love, your bond...

620
01:00:28,252 --> 01:00:32,951
your caring for these two children,
is our most valuable weapon.

621
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:44,092
Let me take the chances.

622
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:48,896
What's that? Some sort of mystical amulet?

623
01:00:49,307 --> 01:00:52,003
- A tool of your trade?
- It was a gift...

624
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:55,174
from a good friend...

625
01:00:55,246 --> 01:00:58,773
a powerful medicine man,
who walked among the spirits...

626
01:00:59,984 --> 01:01:01,542
and returned.

627
01:01:03,955 --> 01:01:05,684
There's power here.

628
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:09,319
I only pray it is enough.

629
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:19,799
Because Kane still thinks he needs her.

630
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:23,005
He was insane when he lived.

631
01:01:23,474 --> 01:01:26,841
And now, in death, that insanity...

632
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:29,445
has become the beast.

633
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:32,449
He wants Carol Anne now...

634
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:34,680
before she grows up.

635
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:37,946
Youth is a strong life force.

636
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,825
Innocence is pure life force.

637
01:01:42,326 --> 01:01:45,989
We lose strength as we lose our innocence.

638
01:01:46,464 --> 01:01:50,298
You see, innocence is the only gift
we're given in life.

639
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:53,899
All else must be fought for.

640
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:58,331
In that gift is purity.

641
01:01:59,644 --> 01:02:01,737
In that purity...

642
01:02:02,213 --> 01:02:04,113
lies strength.

643
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:07,950
- That's a lot of meaningless crap.
- Shut up.

644
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:22,296
Unlock it.

645
01:02:30,975 --> 01:02:33,637
Can you spell "gorilla"?

646
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:36,244
G-O...

647
01:02:37,515 --> 01:02:39,039
R-I...

648
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:42,681
L-L-A.

649
01:02:43,788 --> 01:02:47,485
That is correct. Now try "pheasant. "

650
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,725
Look at the mirror.

651
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:51,818
...H- E...

652
01:02:52,296 --> 01:02:53,354
A...

653
01:02:54,198 --> 01:02:55,927
S-A...

654
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:58,992
N-T.

655
01:03:00,104 --> 01:03:04,234
That is correct. Can you spell "parakeet"?

656
01:03:06,577 --> 01:03:07,566
P...

657
01:03:09,113 --> 01:03:10,307
...R...

658
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:17,682
Come back to this side, Carol Anne.
Come through the mirror.

659
01:03:19,557 --> 01:03:21,684
We want you to come join us.

660
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,459
We miss you.

661
01:03:24,762 --> 01:03:27,287
You can come back through the mirror.

662
01:03:31,636 --> 01:03:34,799
Please come back through the mirror.

663
01:03:34,872 --> 01:03:37,397
Come back to this side, sweetie.

664
01:03:44,982 --> 01:03:47,883
Come to me, Carol Anne.
Don't be frightened.

665
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,745
Don't be afraid, sweetie. Come to us.

666
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:55,415
Won't you join us, Carol Anne?

667
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:10,366
- Come here!
- No!

668
01:04:39,904 --> 01:04:43,465
Don't just stand there!
Get over here, for Christ's sake!

669
01:05:24,348 --> 01:05:26,578
I got you, baby. It's okay.

670
01:05:28,252 --> 01:05:29,378
Here you go.

671
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:35,925
You're all right.

672
01:05:35,993 --> 01:05:38,120
- Where is she?
- Carol Anne is drowning!

673
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:39,787
- She's drowning!
- Where?

674
01:05:43,033 --> 01:05:44,398
You're safe now.

675
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:46,561
Where?

676
01:05:47,604 --> 01:05:51,040
- She's drowning!
- What does it matter anymore?

677
01:05:51,108 --> 01:05:53,201
Who the hell goddamn cares?

678
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:54,803
Baby.

679
01:05:55,713 --> 01:05:57,647
Take care of her for a minute.

680
01:06:01,752 --> 01:06:03,151
It's okay.

681
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,320
Carol Anne's drowning!

682
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:10,349
- You got to get a hold of yourself.
- I can't deal with this anymore.

683
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:13,561
I love you and Donna. That's our family.

684
01:06:14,298 --> 01:06:15,788
Let's get out of here.

685
01:06:15,866 --> 01:06:18,699
- Let Dr. Seaton deal with Carol Anne.
- She's your niece.

686
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:19,895
I don't care.

687
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:22,996
I can't take these sick little games anymore.

688
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,867
I never should have let Steven and Diane
send her to us.

689
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:30,274
Bruce, please!

690
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:53,828
Dad!

691
01:06:55,339 --> 01:06:56,636
Relax, Donna.

692
01:06:58,375 --> 01:06:59,774
You're safe.

693
01:07:00,077 --> 01:07:02,375
You're just having a bad dream.

694
01:07:03,247 --> 01:07:05,442
We're all having a bad dream.

695
01:07:07,017 --> 01:07:09,247
Where's my dad? I want my dad.

696
01:07:09,753 --> 01:07:11,482
Lie here and relax.

697
01:07:12,222 --> 01:07:14,019
I'll go get your dad.

698
01:07:27,471 --> 01:07:28,631
Hello?

699
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:48,511
And they thought I was her.

700
01:10:44,335 --> 01:10:45,632
I saw her.

701
01:10:45,703 --> 01:10:48,501
- You think you saw her.
- I saw her, damn it!

702
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:52,032
Your daughter's upstairs,
a shivering, emotional wreck.

703
01:10:52,109 --> 01:10:55,545
Then you run out on me
to chase after that evil little brat again.

704
01:10:55,613 --> 01:10:58,548
Don't you understand?
Don't you see what she's doing?

705
01:10:58,616 --> 01:11:00,277
It's just like Dr. Seaton said.

706
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:03,616
Nothing Seaton said
explains what happened tonight.

707
01:11:06,557 --> 01:11:07,785
Come on.

708
01:11:20,037 --> 01:11:22,437
The man, he grabbed my hand!

709
01:12:15,626 --> 01:12:17,719
Remember what Tangina said.

710
01:12:50,894 --> 01:12:51,986
Open!

711
01:13:03,507 --> 01:13:05,407
Help us!

712
01:13:15,552 --> 01:13:16,746
Oh, God!

713
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:28,621
Outside in!

714
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:33,933
Help us!

715
01:13:38,242 --> 01:13:40,836
Outside in!

716
01:14:05,302 --> 01:14:07,270
Tangina gave this to me.

717
01:14:09,807 --> 01:14:11,570
She gave this to us!

718
01:14:13,744 --> 01:14:16,838
She's trying to save us.
She's trying to bring us through this.

719
01:14:16,914 --> 01:14:20,145
- It's a lie. It's not true, any of this!
- No, baby.

720
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:21,775
It's not true! You're a liar!

721
01:14:21,852 --> 01:14:24,480
None of this is true! You're a liar!

722
01:14:24,555 --> 01:14:28,457
She's trying to get us through.
She's trying to save our lives.

723
01:14:28,525 --> 01:14:29,992
Just hold on.

724
01:14:32,463 --> 01:14:34,192
Just hold on, baby.

725
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:34,117
No!

726
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:41,430
Who are you?

727
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:50,302
- What do you want?
- You!

728
01:18:01,272 --> 01:18:03,137
It's not cold anymore.

729
01:18:04,275 --> 01:18:05,902
She said we could do it!

730
01:18:05,976 --> 01:18:09,104
She said we could beat them!
It's over, baby.

731
01:18:09,847 --> 01:18:11,246
It's over, darling!

732
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:14,113
- I want to believe that.
- Believe it!

733
01:18:17,021 --> 01:18:19,956
It's finished, and we did it together.

734
01:18:42,214 --> 01:18:43,613
Look at you.

735
01:18:44,316 --> 01:18:46,750
You two are pitiful. You know what?

736
01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:50,117
No, I don't want to know.
I understand these things.

737
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:53,349
Anyway, everybody went home.
And it went fine. I locked up.

738
01:18:53,425 --> 01:18:57,054
You two can read about it tomorrow
in the society columns.

739
01:18:58,029 --> 01:18:59,496
Newlyweds.

740
01:19:00,966 --> 01:19:05,198
Donna's been looking for you. She called.
She and Carol Anne are with that shrink...

741
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:08,899
what's-his-name from the school.
You ought to talk to him.

742
01:19:08,974 --> 01:19:12,341
He's probably never met anybody
with a garage fetish.

743
01:19:13,478 --> 01:19:14,968
Mañana, y'all.

744
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,999
Mr. And Mrs. Stanley, how are you tonight?

745
01:19:38,537 --> 01:19:41,005
I did some plumbing.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

746
01:19:41,072 --> 01:19:43,302
What inconvenience?
We didn't have a problem.

747
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:45,434
If there was a problem, I'm sorry.

748
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:48,070
But the hot water's gonna be on very soon.

749
01:19:51,182 --> 01:19:53,810
I had to say something. I mean, look at us.

750
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:56,944
I didn't get much use
out of last year's salary.

751
01:19:57,022 --> 01:19:58,887
I think you look great wet.

752
01:19:58,957 --> 01:20:02,393
- You can lie like that anytime you want to.
- I usually do.

753
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,654
I know.

754
01:20:05,196 --> 01:20:08,757
I can't wait to get upstairs,
stretch out in bed...

755
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:10,799
and act normal.

756
01:20:11,303 --> 01:20:14,761
- Getting upstairs sounds great.
- What have you got in mind?

757
01:20:14,839 --> 01:20:17,171
Packing everything
that belongs to that brat...

758
01:20:17,242 --> 01:20:19,676
and sending her home to my sister.

759
01:20:22,747 --> 01:20:24,510
It wasn't her fault.

760
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,884
Yes, it is!

761
01:23:03,441 --> 01:23:04,635
Oh, my God!

762
01:23:14,552 --> 01:23:16,213
- Outside in!
- What?

763
01:23:16,353 --> 01:23:19,345
Damn it! Outside in.
That's what Tangina said.

764
01:23:19,724 --> 01:23:24,457
He controls the inside, but not the outside!
We can still get to him. Come on.

765
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:08,329
Don't look down.

766
01:25:57,281 --> 01:25:59,044
All right, hold onto this.

767
01:25:59,116 --> 01:26:01,710
No matter what happens, don't let go.

768
01:26:16,967 --> 01:26:18,867
Fucking son of a bitch!

769
01:26:53,637 --> 01:26:55,036
Go away!

770
01:26:55,873 --> 01:26:58,501
He doesn't want them! He only wants me!

771
01:26:59,043 --> 01:27:02,035
You don't love me. You don't want me here!

772
01:27:02,112 --> 01:27:05,707
My parents don't love me, either!
They sent me away!

773
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:08,681
Kane loves me! Kane wants me!

774
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:13,586
Give me Tangina's necklace,
and you can have Bruce and Donna back.

775
01:27:14,325 --> 01:27:16,088
They're your family.

776
01:27:16,527 --> 01:27:18,222
I'll go with Kane.

777
01:27:18,429 --> 01:27:20,624
Your mom and dad do love you!

778
01:27:21,465 --> 01:27:23,365
They love you very much.

779
01:27:24,435 --> 01:27:26,198
And I love you, too!

780
01:27:26,437 --> 01:27:29,964
It's hard for me to show it sometimes,
but I do love you!

781
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,530
Save your family!

782
01:27:31,608 --> 01:27:34,372
They're the ones who
mean something to you, not me.

783
01:27:34,445 --> 01:27:36,037
That's not true!

784
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,907
You are part of my family!

785
01:27:40,084 --> 01:27:42,882
You and Donna are like my children!

786
01:27:44,121 --> 01:27:47,579
I love you, and I'll do anything to prove that!

787
01:27:47,658 --> 01:27:49,319
You've got to believe me!

788
01:27:49,393 --> 01:27:51,122
No! Go away!

789
01:27:52,529 --> 01:27:53,757
Go away!

790
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:28,717
God!

791
01:29:34,299 --> 01:29:36,062
Where are you, Kane?

792
01:29:36,334 --> 01:29:38,632
Where have you taken my family?

793
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,897
I want them back!

794
01:29:42,273 --> 01:29:44,468
Tangina said you can't take them...

795
01:29:44,542 --> 01:29:47,033
as long as someone here loves them.

796
01:29:48,613 --> 01:29:50,012
I love them.

797
01:29:51,516 --> 01:29:54,917
And I have this to protect me.

798
01:30:14,772 --> 01:30:16,569
The necklace!

799
01:30:24,282 --> 01:30:26,079
Give me the necklace!

800
01:30:26,651 --> 01:30:27,675
No.

801
01:30:28,186 --> 01:30:29,653
The necklace!

802
01:30:35,393 --> 01:30:36,451
Oh, God!

803
01:31:09,194 --> 01:31:11,185
Give her back her family.

804
01:31:12,397 --> 01:31:14,262
You don't need them!

805
01:31:14,332 --> 01:31:16,459
You don't need Carol Anne!

806
01:31:16,534 --> 01:31:18,764
I can lead you into the light!

807
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:23,863
I have the knowledge and the power!

808
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:42,015
No! Tangina, don't!

809
01:31:42,293 --> 01:31:45,922
Tell me how to use the necklace
so I can save all of you.

810
01:31:46,064 --> 01:31:47,588
Thank you, Pat.

811
01:31:47,765 --> 01:31:50,165
But this is the way it has to be.

812
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:53,460
Say goodbye to Carol Anne for me.

813
01:31:54,105 --> 01:31:56,938
Tell her I'll always love her...

814
01:31:58,409 --> 01:32:01,378
and that her nightmare is over.

815
01:32:17,262 --> 01:32:18,752
Tangina, wait!

816
01:32:21,733 --> 01:32:23,257
Where are they?

817
01:33:33,204 --> 01:33:34,569
She did it.

818
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:37,808
She saved us.
