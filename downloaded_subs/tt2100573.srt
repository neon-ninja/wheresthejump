1
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,814
Ted:
He bought this place
a while back.

2
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,516
Ted:
Meant something to him.

3
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,618
Ted:
He spent all his time out
he before--

4
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,326
Damn.

5
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,977
Tina wanted to come. She's--

6
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,478
She's stuck in that
damned training for...

7
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,780
two weeks in Montreal.

8
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,382
Dad told me about that.

9
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,919
Ted, we never talked about Tina.

10
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,922
What's to say?
It was five years ago, Brad.

11
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,358
Yeah,
and we haven't talked since.

12
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,827
Look, I never told you that
I am sorry.

13
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,228
Ted:
Just leave it.

14
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,830
I guess you need a ride back
into town, huh.

15
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,815
Glad to see big brother's...

16
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,218
finally growing out of
his clumsy stage.

17
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,962
Ted:
That's weird.

18
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,039
About thirty feet.

19
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,808
So you think
Dad knew about this?

20
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,976
I don't know.

21
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,012
-He never said anything to you?
-Nope.

22
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,513
So we're going to do this now?

23
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,648
We're doing it now.

24
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,083
Ted, I just got here.

25
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,018
That's why we're doing it now.

26
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,720
-Can I at least go change first?
Ted:
-Nope.

27
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,988
Damn.

28
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,725
So we're just going to

29
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,993
Batman it up and down
this thing...

30
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,861
without any harness or gear,
right?

31
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,797
Why not? I won't stop you
if you'd rather jump.

32
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,735
Brad:
Maybe there's treasure
down there, huh.

33
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,370
Hell no. No.

34
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,573
You gave yourself a black eye
in the 8th grade...

35
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,541
by popping a zit.

36
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,644
I'll make sure it's safe first.

37
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,763
Hey. Touchdown.

38
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,431
Is it cool?

39
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,368
Get down here. Hurry.

40
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,594
Generator.

41
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,824
Ahh. Hey, it works!

42
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,927
It's barely putting out
any power but--

43
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,462
It works.

44
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,723
So what the hell's going on
down here?

45
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,958
I don't know.

46
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,694
Brad:
This stuff looks like it's
been sitting here for decades.

47
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,164
Yeah,
but these light bulbs are new.

48
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
I bet the gas
for that generator is too.

49
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,941
Brad:
Man,
what was Dad doing down here?

50
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,914
I don't know.
He never said a word about it.

51
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,827
Hey!

52
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,129
Hey, if anybody's in there,...

53
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,532
we're not here
to steal your tools.

54
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,233
We're just exploring.

55
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,881
You still claustrophobic?

56
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,884
Hey, what gave me away?

57
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,987
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

58
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,855
Where's that wind coming from?

59
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,581
It feels good.

60
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,884
Brad:
Hey, it looks like
it opens up back there.

61
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,721
Turns off to the right about
fifteen feet back.

62
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,890
You know what? I bet nobody's
ever been back there.

63
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,325
That's a virgin passage.

64
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,896
How do you know?

65
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,131
Cause nothing bigger than a dick
can squeeze through the hole.

66
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,966
No, I mean,...

67
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,668
how do you know
there's not another way in...

68
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,836
on the other side?

69
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,272
I don't know.

70
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,774
I've never heard of
any caves over that way.

71
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:07,980
Look at that.

72
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,916
It's only
a couple of inches thick.

73
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,034
This is just too creepy.

74
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,182
What?

75
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,652
You hear that?

76
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,225
Yeah.

77
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,363
What is it?

78
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,107
Waterfall?

79
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,213
No, no.

80
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,118
A lot of work has been done
to this cave.

81
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,388
The lights. The gravel.
All of this.

82
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,956
Uh-huh.

83
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,729
Why do you think no one has
bothered to open up that hole?

84
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,833
I'd just check
what's back there.

85
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,431
That's why
I was the college athlete.

86
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,434
And you collected Boba Fetts.

87
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,469
Let a real man pop this cherry.

88
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,167
Ted:
We're going to need
a bigger boat.

89
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,422
Uncle Charlie.

90
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:09,161
Bradley! Bradley!
Bradley! Bradley!

91
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,262
How the hell are you?

92
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,098
Look at that, Bradley.
Let me look at you, Bradley.

93
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,934
You got bigger, Bradley.
You're not flat footed at all.

94
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,770
He lives right up the hill now.
Dad and I take care of him.

95
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,139
Charlie:
Hey buddy.

96
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,942
Hey, your daddy's coming back,
Bradley.

97
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,111
On Sunday, okay?

98
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,278
Yes.

99
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,081
Yeah,
I think we'll go fishing again.

100
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,083
All of us together like before,
okay?

101
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,320
My brother's coming back
on Sunday.

102
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,489
No, I don't think so,
Uncle Charlie.

103
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,890
I mean,
it's four days from now...

104
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,059
and I'm not sure how long
Brad's planning on staying.

105
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,528
No, T-Bear. T-Bear. Bradley.
Bradley's staying.

106
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,596
-You're staying, Bradley.
-I'm staying.

107
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,364
-You're really staying.
-Okay. I don't have to...

108
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,066
start work till September
so I was going to...

109
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,300
hang out a couple weeks.

110
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,169
If that's okay with you guys.

111
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,341
Okay, Bradley, stay. Okay.
We go fishing. We go fishing.

112
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,547
Hello?...Oh, hey, honey....

113
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,583
Yeah. No, I'm sorry.

114
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,385
There was no coverage
out there...

115
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,389
Yeah, I'm standing with Ted and
Uncle Charlie right now. Yeah.

116
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,557
Tina says hi.

117
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,326
Oh, hi, Tina Tina.

118
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,495
Brad:
Uncle Charlie says hi, too.

119
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,268
I love you too...

120
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,204
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.

121
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,910
Bradley, was that Tina Tina?

122
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,379
Yeah, Uncle Charlie.

123
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,380
You remember Tina Tina,
don't you?

124
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,883
I remember Tina Tina.
She got me my bicycle.

125
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,518
T-Bear, you remember--

126
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,656
T-Bear. Weren't you the one...

127
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,258
who was supposed to marry
Tina Tina?

128
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,128
It was a long time ago,
Uncle Charlie.

129
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,529
A long time ago.

130
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,064
-Come on here, Bradley...
-No, no, no, no.

131
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,135
Charlie:
Okay, okay, Bradley.
Come on. We'll go to my house.

132
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,309
Check this out.

133
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,477
Holy shit!

134
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,978
Damn, don't touch it!

135
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,313
Well, it's too late now.

136
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,750
Who needs back breaking manual
labor when you've got this shit.

137
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,218
Hey, put it back.
I don't want to get blown up...

138
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,486
on account of you.

139
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,188
At least we'd go together,
big brother.

140
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,390
Well, hooray.

141
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,230
Okay. I charged a couple of
batteries last night...

142
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,699
so I think
we should work in shifts and--

143
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,401
I'll have us in by dinner.

144
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,138
Go, Tarzan.

145
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,144
You know this will take days.

146
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,649
Okay, this officially
just became a bad idea.

147
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,519
So why do we give a rat's ass
what's back there anyway?

148
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:34,059
Yeah. I mean, we already know
what's back there. More cave.

149
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,828
Yeah, just a bunch of rocks.

150
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,529
-In the dark.
-Yeah.

151
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,536
Damn, that breeze feels good.

152
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,206
Yeah.

153
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,635
Hey--

154
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,418
-Hey, what was--
-Shh.

155
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,157
Brad.

156
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:45,497
I think it was a... I think
it was a rock slide back there.

157
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,733
Right...

158
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,141
I don't think that noise
we heard earlier...

159
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,276
was a waterfall.

160
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,478
Why not?

161
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,648
'Cause I don't hear it anymore.

162
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,127
No.

163
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,389
It's just normal
cave type stuff, right?

164
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,396
And what do
we know anyway? Right?

165
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,798
We don't know anything.

166
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,653
It's gonna be a pretty long haul
getting through there.

167
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,389
You sure you're up for it?

168
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,459
Pick me up tomorrow morning
at seven thirty.

169
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,889
You're going to hire us a
Sherpa too, huh?

170
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,625
Come on, man.
We got to do this up right.

171
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,627
We get to be
Indiana Jones today.

172
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,797
Oh, Indiana Jones.

173
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,600
A dull American
Allan Quartermain rip-off.

174
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,701
Blasphemy.

175
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,504
Oh, nerd heads going
caving, eh?

176
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,876
You two need a steady hand of
a pro at the helm.

177
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,544
That's where I come in.

178
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,980
Been in every cave in the state.

179
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,015
Well not this one, Churchill.

180
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,818
No one's been where we're going.

181
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,788
-Virgin?
Brad:
-Yes, virgin.

182
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,958
Let me tag along.

183
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,527
I'll be a Short Round
to your Dr. Jones.

184
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,529
I'll worship at your altar.

185
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,565
I won't do anything gay.
But that's about it.

186
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,000
You're working, aren't you?

187
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,735
Bollocks to this place, man.
I'm no good.

188
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:37,836
You saw that yourselves.

189
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,371
Sorry, mate.

190
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:45,510
Oh, so that's how it is.
You selfish dicks!

191
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,945
Tough tourists.

192
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,752
Hey, Allan Quartermain?
He sucks my ass.

193
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,421
Hey, come back here and
say that!

194
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,060
Ha ha! You'll be back.
You'll be back.

195
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,400
Yeah, you better run!

196
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,652
No.

197
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,522
It's not going to happen.

198
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,560
You know, just a little bit more
and we're in.

199
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,761
One more day's work, max.

200
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,931
Oh shit.
Holy shit, that is tight.

201
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,600
Brad:
Have you ever heard of
Floyd Collins?

202
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,469
He got stuck and
died in a place just like that.

203
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,204
They never got him out.

204
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,972
Okay,
in honor of Mr. Collins,...

205
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,874
let's name this passage
Floyd's Tomb.

206
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,042
You think you're gonna fit.

207
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,444
You think you're just gonna
squeeze right in there, huh.

208
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,312
Ted:
Should be okay
through most of it. I mean...

209
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,180
in the end it's a little tough,
though.

210
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,515
Well you know I'm probably...

211
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,083
not going to be
able to fit in there...

212
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,218
Brad:
What if you get hurt in there?

213
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,819
Brad:
What if you just
twist your ankle?

214
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,954
I'm not going to be in there
to help you.

215
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,922
You'll be completely
on your own.

216
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,557
Ted:
Yeah, I'm used to that.

217
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,128
I'm just glad you're here now.

218
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,099
I was wondering
when you'd go off again.

219
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,249
Brad:
-Are we in?
Ted:
-We're in. Ha, ha, ha.

220
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,585
Whoo! How do you like that?

221
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,456
-How you like that now!
-How do you like that! Whoa!

222
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,159
Come on, we did it!

223
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,029
Wait...
You think Dad would be proud?

224
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,732
Let's get a rope,
tie it around my legs.

225
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,167
I'm going in. Come on. Come on.

226
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,238
You know Dad used to always
come up and see me play...

227
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,640
when I was at Tech.

228
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,210
He never missed a home game.

229
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,711
Yeah, he was proud.

230
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,248
You were always welcome, too,
you know.

231
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,616
Thanks.

232
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,255
What'd you play again?

233
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,126
-What position?
-No. What sport?

234
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,897
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

235
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,738
-Baseball. Center field.
-Cool.

236
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,778
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

237
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,513
I was just never
really into that stuff.

238
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,182
Okay, let's go.

239
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,186
All right, lift my legs up.

240
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,197
Brad:
Ha. Ha.
Ted, you're totally in.

241
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,032
How is it?

242
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,601
It's no fun.

243
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,281
Hey, can you make it?

244
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,216
I don't know.
It's getting pretty tight.

245
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:28,159
-Oh, god. Hey, Ted.
-What?

246
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,928
I just realized
you literally have a...

247
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,796
mountain resting on your back.

248
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,267
I mean one,
one tiny shift of earth and...

249
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,902
All right, Brad, I got it.

250
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,272
Brad:
You're breaking shit, dude.

251
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,940
It's getting hard to breathe,
Brad.

252
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,653
I'm stuck, man,
I can't go any farther.

253
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,354
-I'm coming out.
-Okay, careful.

254
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,092
I can't.

255
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,230
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.
I can't get out.

256
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,234
I'm stuck!

257
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,339
I'll get it. Hang on. Hang on.

258
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,055
The last part's just too tight.

259
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,693
That's cool.

260
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,163
Ah, we gave it
one hell of a try, though.

261
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,339
Where's the drill?

262
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:34,386
Help me out! Help me out!
Pull me out! Pull me out!

263
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,196
Come on! Come on!

264
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,855
A mountain lion maybe?

265
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,958
How can anything like that
get back there?

266
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:20,498
Maybe it was an echo then.
Something weird.

267
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,970
And we never-- we never drilled
from inside there before.

268
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,751
Oh shit.
I left Dad's drill down there.

269
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,022
I will buy you a new one.

270
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,325
Hey, there's no way we're
going back in there, right?

271
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,793
You know that, right?

272
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:14,152
That's the best I can do.
It could be enough.

273
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,293
I'm going to go for it.

274
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,931
Okay. Okay.
Just give me your feet.

275
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,433
No. No.

276
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,970
Either I make it all the way
or I get stuck trying.

277
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,246
Okay. Okay.
Okay, let's do this.

278
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,948
Okay it's time for this thing.
This is all on you.

279
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,451
This is what we've been
working for. You got that inch.

280
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,219
You got nothing
stopping you now.

281
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:52,023
Okay now breathe, breathe.
Come on, breathe! Breathe.

282
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,893
Okay, we can do this now. Okay?

283
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,027
We can do this.

284
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,862
All right, you're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

285
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,998
You're just going to squeeze
right in there. Okay?

286
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,132
Just take it easy.

287
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,500
Take it really easy
and you got it.

288
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,936
Nothing's stopping you now,
okay?

289
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,106
This is all yours. All right.
You ready?

290
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,474
-Yeah.
-You ready?

291
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,608
Okay.

292
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,947
Arms not over.
Arms on my side this time.

293
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,415
Brad:
Okay, just breathe, okay?

294
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,885
You're totally gonna make it.

295
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,253
Come on, you're gonna make it.

296
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,472
Damn.
It's tighter than I remember.

297
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,174
It's cool. You just--

298
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,109
hey, you just gotta
relax yourself.

299
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,946
Just relax.

300
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,222
I cannot believe
we're doing this.

301
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,123
He can be killed doing this.

302
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,425
You doing okay?

303
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,638
This is stupid.
This is really stupid.

304
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,414
This is really stupid.

305
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,488
Come back out, Ted.
Come on. This is stupid.

306
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,623
No.

307
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,391
No. Ted, come back.

308
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,561
I still can't make it.

309
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,496
Well just back on out then.

310
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,698
Okay, we'll just go home.

311
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,102
Brad:
Now just come on back out.
Please.

312
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,504
Brad:
Just get out of here.
I don't want to be here anymore.

313
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,277
I'm gonna have to
let all the air out of my lungs.

314
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,645
And then just scoot forward
to get on from here.

315
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,747
No, that's insane.

316
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,182
No, let's...
look, let's just go home.

317
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,685
Brad:
We've done everything
we can here.

318
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,153
-Here goes.
Brad:
-No, Ted, damn it.

319
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:06,090
Get out of the hole!
Come on. I believe you.

320
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,259
Come on. You don't have to
prove yourself anymore.

321
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,462
Brad, I don't need this
right now, okay?

322
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:17,201
Ted:
Not now.
Just be with me here. Please.

323
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,073
Just be with me this time. Okay?

324
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,177
Okay, I'm with you.

325
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,580
I'm with you big brother.

326
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,552
Okay. Okay, you can do this.
Okay, you can do this.

327
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,488
Brad:
Just take it really slow,
okay? You be careful.

328
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,575
I can't breathe!

329
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,611
-Okay, I'm coming to get you.
- No. No.

330
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,317
Okay, you push through.

331
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:17,328
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

332
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,364
Damn it, Ted. You push through!

333
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,834
You son of a bitch...

334
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,803
Don't you give up on me now.
You break through.

335
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,283
Ted:
I did it.

336
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,389
Ted, please, push forward.

337
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,092
-Ted!
-Ahhh!

338
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,433
Hi. I'm through!

339
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,707
You made it! Ha, ha, ha. Whoa!

340
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,878
Brad:
Whoa! Shit, you made it!

341
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:10,481
You did it! Yes, you did.

342
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,816
What are you so damn
excited about?

343
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,285
I'm the one
who was stuck in the hole.

344
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,255
Oh my god you made it,
you crazy son of a bitch.

345
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,123
Yeah. I was there, remember?

346
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,191
Hey.

347
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,694
Hey. Hey. What's back there?

348
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,365
Ted:
There's this big corridor.

349
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,334
It's beautiful.

350
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,669
I'm going to go take a look.

351
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,204
Hey.

352
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,641
Just--just don't
get out of earshot, okay?

353
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,775
'Cause I won't be able to
hear you...

354
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,210
if you get hurt or anything.

355
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,279
Aye aye, Captain.
All right. Got it.

356
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,582
Hey, you okay?

357
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,716
Yeah.

358
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,519
You okay?

359
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,657
Yeah.

360
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,277
Brad!

361
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,915
Brad:
Ted.

362
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,434
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
Magellan returns.

363
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,737
Damn! Coming back's easier.

364
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,438
-You okay?
-Yeah.

365
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,447
It's a boy!

366
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,551
At least that's what
he keeps telling me.

367
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,788
-So how was it?
-It was awesome, man.

368
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,557
I didn't get that far in,
though.

369
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,026
Sound travels like
shit in there.

370
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,328
There's a lot more to explore.

371
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,729
You're not going by yourself.

372
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:39,697
It's too dangerous.

373
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,799
We got to find
someone else to go with you.

374
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,635
I know just the guy.

375
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,836
-No.
-Yeah.

376
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,471
-No.
-Yes.

377
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,674
No!

378
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,808
Yes!

379
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,447
Yeah, okay, thank you.
Thank you. That's great.

380
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,715
There's a long way down
that hole.

381
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:58,716
So watch it.

382
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,018
I'm not taking your ass
to the emergency room.

383
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:07,024
Prepare to be blocked in tight.
The wall's a bit slick.

384
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,893
Sharp rocks down there
so be careful..

385
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,276
What's with the arts and crafts?

386
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,012
All my stuff's handmade,
you wanker.

387
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,448
You got to improvise down there.

388
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,417
Sometimes right on the spur
of the moment.

389
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,952
Now you two amateurs...

390
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,622
probably haven't been caving
long enough...

391
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:41,559
to burn through your first baby
nine volts have you?

392
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,061
But see...

393
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,796
This way...

394
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,101
I don't have to worry about
batteries going south now, do I?

395
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,605
Blow me.
There's one more in here. Oh!

396
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,040
That's hilarious.

397
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:59,510
Speaking of going south,
if you'll excuse me...

398
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,879
I've got a date
with a lovely hole.

399
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,050
Joe:
Ugh. Yeah...

400
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,688
I'd hate to hand
anything to you, Ted.

401
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,524
But you must have a massive
set of the old wrinklies...

402
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,726
to stuff yourself
through that thing.

403
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,928
It's tighter than a nun's ass.

404
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,563
All right, I'm coming in.

405
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,669
Make you famous.

406
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,073
-Come on lard ass.
-Got it.

407
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,811
Man, take a look
at these beauties, mate.

408
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,613
Joe:
Formations for days.

409
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,982
As virgin
as a box of broken beer bottles.

410
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,917
Ted:
-I told you.
Brad:
-Okay, here it comes.

411
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,352
Ted:
Okay.

412
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,791
Ow. Oh god.

413
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,592
What the hell was that?

414
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,129
Forest Chump here tried to
fight a rock with his skull.

415
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,931
-Is he okay?
- Oh god.

416
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,767
The rock won.

417
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:57,902
Hey, Ted, come on back through.

418
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,037
Ted:
Hell no. We didn't put in
all that work to let...

419
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,605
somebody else go first.
I'm going.

420
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,942
Oh bullocks to that Dr. Quest.

421
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,512
You are unfit for
the unknown today, I'm afraid.

422
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,581
Joe:
You're going.
You're going home.

423
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:18,689
Slither away, Dr. Jones.
Slither away.

424
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,792
Quartermain's here
to pick up your slack.

425
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,462
Oh, this little piggy
went to market.

426
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:25,763
-You're not helping here.
-This little piggy...

427
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,866
slithered home.
This little piggy in shame.

428
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,868
Ted:
Shut up Joe.

429
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,870
Joe:
This little piggy
didn't know which way to go.

430
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,940
Joe:
This little piggy said,
"Bye bye, Joe."

431
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,642
Joe:
Can you blokes
see my ass from there?

432
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,145
Joe:
I'm walking into
virgin territory.

433
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,548
Joe:
-Oh, look at that!
Brad:
-Will you shut up, Joe!

434
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,485
Joe:
It's absolutely gorgeous.

435
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,586
Joe:
I just figured out...

436
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,122
Joe:
why Indy Jones wears a hat
all the time.

437
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,924
Joe:
To cover the bump
on his Yankee head.

438
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,961
Hey, we'll come back tomorrow.

439
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,831
Joe:
Hey, Ted,
can you do me a favor?

440
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:04,935
Tell me, who was the second man
on the moon?

441
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,070
I have no idea.

442
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,038
Exactly.

443
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,608
Be back in an hour, Joe.
One hour.

444
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,781
It's an hour and
forty five minutes.

445
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,785
Joe! Hello?

446
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,521
Joe, what the hell is going on
back there?

447
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,623
Brad:
What, did he stop for tea time?

448
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,600
So how much do you remember
about Mom?

449
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,474
Damn.

450
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:52,583
I was only three when she left,
so, not much really.

451
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,053
Ted:
I was five.

452
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,288
Ted:
I guess I should
remember more,...

453
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,256
Ted:
but all I really have
is the day she left.

454
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,193
It was stupid kid stuff but...

455
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,730
I've spent a long time wondering
what I'd done to make her go.

456
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,538
No. Things got too rough for her
and she left. Okay?

457
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,073
Nothing more to it than that.

458
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,782
There's a lot of
that going round in this family.

459
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,908
You know I'm here now.

460
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:54,245
So you can give me some
damn credit for that at least.

461
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,680
It doesn't matter.
Just forget it.

462
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,716
Yeah, I would like to...

463
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,885
if you would take
your own advice..

464
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,786
and stop pulling this shit
out of the blue every time we--

465
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,121
That's enough.

466
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,159
Where's that limey
bastard anyway?

467
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,899
Hey, if you have something
to say to me, then have at it.

468
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,700
Otherwise, get off my back!

469
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:17,902
Get off your back?
What about my back...

470
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,003
you son of a bitch?

471
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,304
-Mine! Mine!
-Okay.

472
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:21,972
-I see it, okay?
-For five years...

473
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,374
you did whatever the hell
you wanted.

474
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,742
With whoever the hell
you wanted.

475
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:26,911
While I rotted down here taking
care of Dad and Uncle Charlie.

476
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,078
All right. I see how it is.
Okay, I see.

477
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,980
-And I told you I'm sorry.
-My back's the one that's...

478
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,149
been stepped on, Brad.
Not yours.

479
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,984
You think you can come in here
with your 'I'm sorry's'...

480
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,986
and everything's going
to be okay? I don't--

481
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,012
Joe?

482
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,351
What's in there?
What are we hearing?

483
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,318
Let's get out of here, please.

484
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,887
-Shh. Get back.
-We got to get out of here.

485
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,055
Brad:
What if we see something.

486
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,156
Brad:
We should have said
something to him.

487
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:47,891
Ted:
-Let's just go!
Brad:
-Just stop.

488
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,202
-I have to go get him.
-No. Don't do it.

489
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,270
-I have to get him.
-Don't.

490
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,074
We brought--we brought him here!
Brad, we--

491
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,344
Shit.

492
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,848
Joe.

493
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,822
You all right, Joe?
What happened?

494
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,956
What happened, Joe?

495
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,124
Hey man.

496
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,795
What was that noise?
What was the noise?

497
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,832
Ted:
Joe! Hey, wait up, man.
Come on.

498
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,934
What's going on? Joe!

499
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,903
Joe, don't do it. Come on.

500
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,940
Stop! Stop! Joe!

501
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,909
-What did you see, Joe?
-Come on, man, tell us.

502
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,343
Ted:
-Talk to me.
Brad:
-What did you see?

503
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,413
Hey, you forgot your stuff.

504
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,503
You left all your stuff.

505
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,876
Brad:
Yeah.

506
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,310
He still won't answer.

507
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,478
Brad:
I know. I just called the store.

508
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,847
Brad:
They said
he didn't come in again today.

509
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,516
Ted:
-Brad?
Brad:
-Yeah.

510
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,184
Ted:
We have to go back.

511
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,588
Brad:
Tomorrow.

512
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,562
Okay. Bye.

513
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,998
Hey, Joe. Open up, man.

514
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,012
Joe. Come on, man.
I know you're in there.

515
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:56,560
Hey, Joe. I can see you, man.

516
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,262
Ted:
Joe, just open the door.

517
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,132
Open the door, man. Come on.

518
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,434
Ted:
Come on,
man I see you right there.

519
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,239
Just tell me
what was in the hole.

520
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,514
Joe, you're really scaring me.
What did you see, man?

521
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,778
Hey, hey.

522
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:54,217
Hey, you know what?
I am one lying bastard.

523
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,153
So I go into the local grotto
this morning...

524
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,556
and I convince them that I'm
this real caver or something.

525
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,491
So they let me borrow
this real deal equipment.

526
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,793
Check this shit out, dude.

527
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,630
So they said the walkies'
might not work there.

528
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:10,333
But if you're wired
it's guaranteed.

529
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,269
Just plug it in
when you want to talk.

530
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,375
You nervous or something?

531
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,513
Maybe just cold feet.

532
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,150
Well Joe spent
a lot of time in there and

533
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,286
he came out fine, right?

534
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,822
I mean he was a little spooked,
but. I mean they also said--

535
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,491
the guys at the grotto said
he's a drama queen.

536
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,327
Superstitious and what not.

537
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,764
I bet the echo just spooked him.

538
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,886
You ready?

539
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:13,263
Hey, just check in
from time to time.

540
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,599
Just keep me on the up. Okay.

541
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,670
Hey, dude, you okay?

542
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,472
You want some aspirin?
I think I--

543
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,978
Well
you're in a foul mood today.

544
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,846
You can be a little
more appreciative.

545
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,981
Do you know
what a pain in the ass...

546
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,916
it was to get this stuff
for you?

547
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,320
Brad:
Well how long do you plan
on looking around back there?

548
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:42,225
Hey, Ted. Ted!

549
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,496
What is with you today?

550
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,632
Okay, did I say something?

551
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,010
You heard me.

552
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,380
Brad:
Oh, damn it I was just
trying to protect you, okay.

553
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,448
Brad:
I didn't think
you were ready for all this yet.

554
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,518
Yeah, I was. You weren't.

555
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:09,819
Full of shit as always.

556
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,988
Just come back here, okay?
Let's talk about--

557
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,623
Pass me the radio. Hurry up.

558
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,392
No, I'm not.
Not until you come out...

559
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,860
and we talk about this,
okay. I--

560
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,562
Pass me the radio right now...

561
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,430
or I'm going in without it.
I don't care.

562
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,565
Brad:
Not here, okay?

563
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,732
If I get stuck in there,...

564
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,267
I won't be able to get
in touch with you.

565
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,369
It'll be your fault, Brad.
Your fault!

566
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,040
Look, just come back out, okay?

567
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,908
Don't do this, not right now,
okay?

568
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,712
Let's talk this through.
We just need to talk about this.

569
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:38,848
Brad:
You know
I cannot follow you back there.

570
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,651
-I know.
Brad:
-Please.

571
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:45,655
Brad:
Ted, come back out
and we can talk about this.

572
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,357
Brad:
Ted, come back.

573
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:02,772
Brad:
Ted, I just wanted to
make sure the phone worked.

574
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,708
It works.

575
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,409
Brad:
Just be careful.

576
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,522
Come on. Come on!

577
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,623
Brad:
Hello?

578
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,094
What are you sleeping?

579
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,729
Brad:
Well not now.

580
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,900
Ted:
That's it, man. Dead end.

581
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,536
There's nothing back here.

582
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,138
Coming back.

583
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,673
Brad:
All right.

584
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:31,601
Brad? Brad? Brad?

585
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:36,272
Ted:
Brad!

586
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:00,923
Brad! Brad!

587
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,826
Ted:
Brad!

588
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,047
Ted:
Brad! Brad!

589
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,082
Brad:
-Ted!
-Help me!

590
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,350
Please, Brad,
pull me out of here!

591
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,852
-Ted, what's wrong?
-Come in here with me.

592
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,522
Come on, hurry.

593
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:37,326
Hurry, hurry, Brad. Help me.
Come on, hurry! Come on.

594
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,132
You're almost there.

595
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,836
Brad! Help me, Brad!

596
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,104
Okay, come on.

597
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,372
Brad!

598
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,213
Brad!

599
01:01:58,414 --> 01:01:59,982
Brad!

600
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:07,457
Grab me. Help! Pull me out!

601
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,470
Oh god, help me, it's here.

602
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,477
Brad:
Come on.

603
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,915
Brad:
Come on!

604
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,496
Get it off.

605
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,099
Ted, let go.

606
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:55,872
Let go. Let go. Run. Run.

607
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:01,911
Cut the damn rope. Come on.
Cut the rope.

608
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,580
-Just do it.
-I am!

609
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,251
Faster, Brad! Do it!

610
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,122
-Let's go. Let's go.
-I'm trying. I'm trying.

611
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:17,894
Get it off. Get it off me.

612
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,162
Cut it!

613
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,527
Ted:
Go for it.

614
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,197
Charlie:
Hello. Hello, Ted the Bear?

615
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,498
Charlie:
T-Bear, you mad at me?

616
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:00,169
Charlie:
You-you won't answer
your phone again, okay?

617
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:03,906
Charlie:
Brad won't come out
of his room, T-Bear.

618
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,509
Charlie:
Did I do something wrong?

619
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,579
Charlie:
Ted the Bear. My brother...

620
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:14,250
Charlie:
He has his
birthday party in three days.

621
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,451
Charlie:
Already got his present.

622
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,155
Charlie:
It's a pretty one too.
I made it myself. Okay?

623
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,191
Charlie:
I want to see my brother!

624
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:25,962
Charlie:
Let me Ted the Bear. Okay? Bye.

625
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,498
Damn.

626
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,549
Oh!

627
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:29,552
Oh!

628
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,310
Ted:
Go for it.

629
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:06,682
Joe:
Ted, it's Joe. I'm...

630
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,518
Ted:
-Joe!
Joe:
-Ted! Ted! Ted!

631
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,887
Joe:
Get them off me.

632
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,309
Hey Joe!

633
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,757
Hey, Dude.
This dude is dead. Dead.

634
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:52,361
Dead? No. What? When?

635
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,830
I found him yesterday, man.
Some kind of meth head deal.

636
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,199
He was all cranked up out
at the house.

637
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,734
Frigging tweaker.

638
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,905
What.

639
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,542
What, you know this guy?

640
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:11,580
You, you his family?
Are you his family?

641
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:16,552
Be up here. Over there.
I think, yeah.

642
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:22,458
They can see if from the door.
Right there.

643
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,289
I thought you weren't
leaving till Monday.

644
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,457
Yeah. Well, I didn't see
the point in staying.

645
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,360
And you won't talk to me.

646
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,833
At least- at least things--
things getting all worn out--

647
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,002
I have to board
the hole back up, Brad.

648
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,373
No, I'm not going back there,
Ted.

649
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,008
Okay, we have to go back there.
We have to put it right.

650
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,677
We have to make it like it was.

651
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,712
Why don't we just--
let's get out of here, okay?

652
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,814
-We'll take Uncle Charlie--
-Joe is dead.

653
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:27,890
Oh this is not our fault.
It's not our fault, okay?

654
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,658
-It's not our fault.
-What?

655
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:32,461
What is not our fault, Brad?
What is not our fault?

656
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,949
Oh shit, man.

657
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,719
It's just a coincidence, okay?

658
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:00,756
We didn't do that, okay?
That is not our fault.

659
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,692
They were camping.
Look where they were?

660
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,995
-No. I don't believe it, okay?
-The area where we were.

661
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:10,099
We got to make this right.

662
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,401
We got to put it back
like it was.

663
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,769
-No, okay?
-We have to.

664
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,838
No, I won't go back there, okay?

665
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,640
We have to try to make it right!

666
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,508
-We don't even know if it was--
-We have to make it right, Brad.

667
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,878
I will not go back there.
I just want to go home.

668
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:24,880
Okay,
I got a family to go home to.

669
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:29,852
We're not your family, huh? Huh?
I'm not your family, Brad?

670
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,465
Come on...

671
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,100
Brad:
Ted, she's pregnant.

672
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,771
She's pregnant.

673
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,575
Brad:
We found out right before
I came down here.

674
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,082
I got to go home to her.

675
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:07,890
Go home, Brad.

676
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,094
Go home to your family.

677
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,029
Maybe I'll see you
at the next funeral.

678
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,766
I knew you'd run away.

679
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:55,938
Let's just hurry up.

680
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,874
I want to get this done
before dark.

681
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,612
I'm scared, Ted.

682
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,883
I've never been this scared
in my whole life.

683
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,421
I'm scared too, Brad.

684
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,166
Do you have the tools
we need at your house?

685
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,201
A lot of what we had
is still in the cave.

686
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,803
Yeah.

687
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,772
Do you really think
boarding this thing up...

688
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:31,473
is going to do any good?

689
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,213
I think the real problem is
what's behind that round rock.

690
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,485
There's nothing on Earth...

691
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,087
that can make me go back
in that cave.

692
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,825
This is going to have to do.

693
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:56,064
Yeah.
Well, it didn't work for Dad.

694
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:32,501
Yeah look it. Perfect.

695
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,044
I'm telling you
we don't need that.

696
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:43,579
Ted:
Yeah, we do.
Just grab the tools.

697
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,047
This is way too much. Okay?

698
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,583
We don't need to take as much.

699
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:48,884
Ted:
You want to get out there
before dark, let's go.

700
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,819
Brad:
Yes, because I'm leaving
as soon as we're done.

701
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,621
Ted:
All right.
Let's get it done then.

702
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:23,018
Can we hurry up?
It's getting late.

703
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,654
Here. Just in case.

704
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,159
Come on.

705
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,266
No, no, no, no. no.
No, Charlie, no.

706
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,606
Pick up the phone, Charlie!
Pick up the phone!

707
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,777
Ted:
The map's gone.

708
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:52,614
The map-- it's not here, Brad.
It's not here!

709
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,082
-Charlie!
-Charlie!

710
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,752
-Charlie!
-Charlie!

711
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:01,290
-Charlie!
-Charlie!

712
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,989
Charlie!

713
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,758
-Charlie!
-Charlie! Charlie!

714
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:37,926
Charlie!

715
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,361
Do we have any lights here?

716
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:42,130
This is serious. Charlie!

717
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:44,099
Charlie!

718
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:46,168
Brad:
Ted!

719
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,236
-Charlie!
-That's all we got here.

720
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,404
-That's it?
-That's it.

721
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:03,251
-Charlie! Charlie where are you?
-Charlie! Charlie!

722
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:08,323
-Charlie!
-Ted!

723
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,326
Ted:
Come on, okay. Come on.

724
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,331
Come on, the thing's in here,
Ted.

725
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,700
The thing's in the dark.

726
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,769
The thing's in the dark.

727
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:46,928
Oh god. Charlie's in there.

728
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,898
-Charlie!
-Charlie! Charlie!

729
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,767
-What do we do? What do we do?
-Charlie!

730
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:06,948
Here we come, Charlie.

731
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,389
Ted! No, wait!

732
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,472
Charlie!

733
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,374
Oh shit.

734
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:36,511
Ted, come back! Ted, come back!
Hurry, come back!

735
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,258
Jesus.

736
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:55,497
Ted, what's going on?
Ted, talk to me, please.

737
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,437
Ted!

738
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,911
Ted, I'm coming!

739
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:17,519
Charlie! Where are you? Charlie!

740
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:22,224
Come back, Charlie!

741
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,479
Ugh!

742
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,387
Ted!

743
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,958
Ted!

744
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,929
Brad:
Damn it. Come on. I can't move.

745
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,836
Help!

746
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:13,875
Help! Help!

747
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,430
Ted, I'm coming!

748
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,152
Stop them! Stop them!

749
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,562
Stop moving!

750
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,173
Charlie! Ted!

751
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,938
I'm in the hole.

752
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,727
You son of a bitch!

753
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:29,577
Uncle Charlie! Ted!

754
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,748
Charlie:
Come get us.

755
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:38,186
He's not coming back.
He's not coming back.

756
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,754
Norman's not coming back.

757
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,757
Please stay still. Please.

758
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,327
Ted:
Hurry. Hurry.
The flare's going lower.

759
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:56,171
Run. Run.

760
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:58,473
Ted.

761
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:13,355
Ted:
Stay still. Stay still.

762
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,292
I got it. I got it.

763
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,495
No. Wait. Wait.
Uncle Charlie, stop!

764
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:31,706
Ted!

765
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,619
I'm going to go in.

766
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:47,455
Come on! Get up.

767
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,391
Get out.

768
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:50,692
Ted.

769
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:08,543
Get him!

770
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:13,381
-Here. Light it. Burn it.
-Okay

771
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:20,455
Throw it in. Now! Right now.

772
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,124
-Come on.
-I got it.

773
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:31,699
No, Charlie, no!
No, Charlie, no! No, no!

774
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:32,801
Come on!

775
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,804
Let me go. Let me die.

776
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,341
No!

777
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,849
You'll be the best man.
You'll be the best man.

778
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:55,190
-Charlie!
-Don't let go!

779
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:56,825
-No!
-No!

780
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,696
-Charlie!
-Charlie!

781
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,702
Charlie!

782
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:12,907
Ted!

783
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,780
Ted!

784
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,943
I hope this is enough light
to keep us safe.

785
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,494
Ted:
Is that all we have left?

786
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,555
Ride it through.

787
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:37,759
You're my brother.

788
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,833
So what's it going to be, huh,
a boy or a girl?

789
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:50,705
-I don't know yet.
-You don't know.

790
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:05,353
You want to know what's
the most beautiful thing...

791
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:06,521
I ever saw?

792
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:12,961
It was your swing. Your swing.

793
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:17,031
Your swing that night you hit
that grand slam against State.

794
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,335
It was a wonder.

795
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,506
Your batting average was
328 that year.

796
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,842
Your junior year.

797
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,445
You hit 32 home runs,
86 RBIs and...

798
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,815
-Forgive me, I can't remember.
-It's okay.

799
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:36,317
How many stolen bases you had.

800
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,054
It wasn't just Dad.

801
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:44,926
I never missed
a home game either. I just--

802
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:48,062
I just never wanted you to know.

803
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:54,502
I forgive you.
I forgive you, little brother.

804
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:56,337
Please forgive me.

805
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:12,954
It's time to go home, Brad.

806
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,425
It's time to go home.

807
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,473
Come on, I'll help you.

808
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,776
No, get up. Get up.

809
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:38,346
Stop. Stop.

810
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:46,587
Listen. Listen.
There's just enough left.

811
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:47,922
You can make it out if you run.

812
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,924
No. No, you're not going to
leave me. Listen!

813
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:52,026
You have to make it
out of here, okay?

814
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,896
We have to make sure.
You're gonna have a baby soon.

815
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:57,999
The future's in front of you.
You get to be a dad.

816
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:00,001
No, no, no.
You're coming with me.

817
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:01,536
Stop! Stop!

818
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:05,406
See. See.

819
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:12,747
Don't worry about me.
I'm right behind you.

820
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:16,884
I'll be right behind you.
Now go.

821
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:18,853
-No. No.
-Go!

822
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:43,611
No!

823
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:46,714
Brad:
Ted! Ted!

824
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:52,787
Don't step on this, Brad.
I'm riding it.

825
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,089
Brad:
-Ted!
-You'd better run.

826
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:58,893
Ted!

827
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,064
Don't, Ted. Don't!

828
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,772
Ted! Ted! Ted! Ted!

829
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:13,541
Ted:
Go home, Brad. Go home.

830
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:15,777
Ted! Ted!

831
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:45,032
Ted, I'm sorry.

832
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:39,046
I'm sorry.

833
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:43,651
I'm so... I'm so...

834
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:49,023
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

835
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,060
I'm so sorry.
