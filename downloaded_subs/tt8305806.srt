00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:31,274
Hello?

3
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,489
I'm here!

4
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,987
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, mom. It's me.

5
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,556
I just made it to the Gambles'.

6
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,657
<i>Is that boy there too?</i>

7
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,093
Mom, no. I'm not with Mark.

8
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:27,330
- <i>Are you sure about that?</i>
- Yeah, I wish.

9
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:29,799
- <i>Megan.</i>
- Seriously? It's a joke.

10
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:33,001
<i>You know your Aunt Maddie got
pregnant at 16. It ruined her life.</i>

11
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:36,204
- Mom!
- <i>I just wish you'd be honest with me.</i>

12
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:38,974
No, seriously,
I'm just babysitting tonight.

13
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,343
<i>I want you home right after.</i>

14
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,378
- <i>That's the rule.</i>
- Okay.

15
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:48,518
Hey, um, I gotta go, okay?

16
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,453
<i>Alright.
See you tonight, sweetie.</i>

17
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:52,189
Yeah, okay, bye.

18
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,170
Joanne?

19
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,581
Wait!

20
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,857
<i>Hey, everyone,
current time is 1:52 p.m.</i>

21
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:45,093
<i>We're about 20 minutes out from
our scheduled stop in Cascade.</i>

22
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,229
<i>And after that we'll be on to
Bear Lake and then on..</i>

23
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,801
<i>Nice work there.</i>

24
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,504
You're quite the little artist.

25
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,374
Shit! Jesus.

26
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:35,210
Alright, alright.
Hey, relax.

27
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:38,280
See?
Hey, we're even, okay?

28
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:39,817
Stupid dog.

29
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:51,494
Oh, shit, shit.

30
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:53,996
<i>Dad, the TV doesn't have
an HDMI port.</i>

31
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:58,067
- What?
- Your TV doesn't have an HDMI port!

32
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,570
<i>Is it plugged in?</i>

33
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,803
You hear that?

34
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:36,708
I love that.

35
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:40,878
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

36
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,448
Be right back.

37
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,786
Ba-da!

38
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:51,587
Well?

39
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:54,222
It's a bike. I'm..

40
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,058
Look, I... I... I picked
it up cheap.

41
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,727
I thought it would, uh

42
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,261
you know, give you
a little independence.

43
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:01,263
I already have my license.

44
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:02,998
- So?
- So what do I need a bike for?

45
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,768
I mean, how am I supposed
to ride that thing anyways?

46
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,304
- I'll just get a car.
- Oh, yeah?

47
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,272
With what money?

48
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,276
Mom said she'd give me one.

49
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,544
Mom's buying you a new car?

50
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:18,147
Mom is getting herself a new car

51
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,015
and she's giving me the old one.

52
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:23,285
- The Lincoln?
- Hey, I mean, that is a nice bike, right?

53
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,623
- I love the basket.
- Shut up.

54
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,659
Oh, man.

55
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,964
You're all grown-up and fancy,
huh?

56
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,599
I will have to teach you

57
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,734
how to drive a stick
while you're up here.

58
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:42,440
I mean... after that heals.

59
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,711
Yeah.

60
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:50,848
When are we gonna
talk about that?

61
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:56,454
Not now.

62
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:04,362
You... are on dish duty.

63
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:07,865
God.

64
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:34,223
Hey. Who's she?

65
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:37,361
Oh, I don't know.
A lot of vacation homes up here.

66
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,095
Alright.

67
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,410
Huh, here it is.

68
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,880
That's the look.

69
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:00,382
<i>Matt's gonna be on sailing
instruction from 1:00 to 2:00</i>

70
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:03,085
<i>and then Carrie's gonna
take over after that.</i>

71
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,690
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, you're gonna say that.

72
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:15,099
Coming through.

73
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:22,171
Hey, y... you can't take that
out on the water, alright?

74
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,341
- It's gotta stay in the picnic area.
- It's my dad's boat.

75
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:25,708
- What do you care?
- It's a hazard.

76
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,311
It belongs in the picnic area.
Get it off.

77
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:29,979
Oh, it's a hazard.

78
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:33,250
We're surrounded by water,
dumbass.

79
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:34,919
Have a wonderful day.

80
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,558
- Asshole.
- Watch the language, buddy.

81
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,128
Right here, guys.
Thanks.

82
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:48,464
- You're Liam's kid, right?
- Yeah, that's me.

83
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,300
Great.
Little help?

84
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,470
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

85
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,341
Over this way.

86
00:10:58,343 --> 00:11:02,745
- Guess nepotism is alive and well, huh?
- What?

87
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:05,648
What, you think I would have gotten
this job if my arm was broken?

88
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,449
It's gotta be a liability
or something.

89
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:11,053
- Are you even certified?
- I've worked for my dad before.

90
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:12,688
Yeah, well,
you haven't worked here.

91
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,291
This is a family marina, okay?

92
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:15,927
So just watch the swearing.

93
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:20,095
- Yeah, sorry.
- I'm fucking with you.

94
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,266
I'm Mallory.
No, nobody gives a shit here.

95
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,402
Ah, Ben.

96
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:26,435
Nice to meet you, Ben.

97
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,939
Nice to..
Yeah.

98
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,574
- Right here is good, thanks.
- <i>Hey, can I tie down here?</i>

99
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,879
No, no, no, no,
that spot's already reserved.

100
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,114
Taste the rainbow?

101
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,053
Yeah.
That's Skittles, but okay.

102
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:44,687
Oh, lemon?
Gross.

103
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,891
It's all about the strawberry
and the cherry.

104
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,124
Well, I'm a lemon guy.

105
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,160
And a dinosaur guy?

106
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:53,796
- Hey, my slip says 17.
- I gotta... I gotta take this.

107
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:56,732
- Am I in the right spot?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

108
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,133
- <i>Hey, honey.</i>
- <i>Hey, mom.</i>

109
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,135
Sorry I didn't, uh,
call you back.

110
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,304
<i>You keeping busy?</i>

111
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:04,073
Yeah, uh, been pretty busy,
but it's good.

112
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,607
<i>Okay.</i>

113
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:08,544
<i>I know he's got you
working today.</i>

114
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,114
<i>So, how's your dad doing?</i>

115
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,516
<i>Hey, ma, I'll, uh, I'll call
you a little later, okay?</i>

116
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:17,188
- <i>Okay, sweetie. I love you.</i>
- Okay.

117
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,288
Watch your step there, goober.

118
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,792
Mom, I don't think
this is the trail anymore.

119
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,728
Nope.
We are way off the trail.

120
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,631
Come on, this is an adventure,
not a tour.

121
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,999
Aw, but are we lost?

122
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,335
Can't be lost
if we didn't know

123
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:07,838
where we were going
in the first place.

124
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,408
Spin it.

125
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,442
Okay.

126
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:14,812
I know exactly where we are.

127
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,781
Don't tell dad we got lost

128
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:22,352
and I'll let you DJ
on the whole way home, okay?

129
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:24,588
- Okay.
- Okay. Come on.

130
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,807
Dillon?

131
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:52,315
Dillon?

132
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:01,491
<i>Dillon?</i>

133
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:14,703
<i>Dillon?</i>

134
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:17,908
<i>Dillon, come down here, baby.</i>

135
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:22,644
<i>Mommy needs help.</i>

136
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:24,646
<i>Come here, sweetheart.</i>

137
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,747
<i>Come on.
It's okay.</i>

138
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:27,683
<i>Dillon, come down here, baby.</i>

139
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:29,184
<i>Dillon!</i>

140
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,953
<i>You're going to be
in so much trouble</i>

141
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,122
<i>if you don't
come here right now.</i>

142
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,325
<i>Listen to mommy,
you little shit!</i>

143
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:37,059
<i>Do as I say, Dillon!</i>

144
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,760
<i>Dillon!</i>

145
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:40,597
<i>Mommy's getting angry!</i>

146
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,998
Hey, don't dip out
on me like that.

147
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,436
It freaks me out.

148
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,636
<i>Come on.</i>

149
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,307
I think I found a path back.

150
00:14:58,215 --> 00:14:59,948
Ready, bud?

151
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,356
We're gonna get inside, and daddy's
gonna drink lots of beers, yeah.

152
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:10,360
Abbs?

153
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:11,628
Just gonna do a quick how-to
showing you

154
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,928
<i>how to field dress these guys.</i>

155
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,297
You should be able to
just grab it

156
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:15,664
tug it down

157
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,999
and start working
everything out.

158
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,701
- <i>Go to the old butthole here..</i>
- Abbs?

159
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:20,802
- Hey.
- Hey.

160
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:22,171
We got a buck, baby.

161
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:23,473
I saw, yeah.

162
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:25,575
Ah, why is it in our driveway?

163
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:27,009
Ah, we hit it on the road.

164
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,043
- <i>Ready, Dillon?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

165
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,479
You had an accident?

166
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:31,046
Truck's fine. We're fine.

167
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,882
Don't work yourself
into a tizzy.

168
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:35,884
What are you doing with that?

169
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:37,152
It's good meat.

170
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:39,324
I'm gonna clean it, gut it.

171
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:41,558
What?

172
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,691
I used to do it with dad

173
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,161
all the time out here.

174
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,599
Hey, Abbs, you really think
that's a good idea?

175
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,033
Guy could have nightmares.

176
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,801
I don't want our kids growing up
thinking meat

177
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:55,340
comes from a store
wrapped in plastic.

178
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,810
Okay.

179
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,348
Mommy's beer?

180
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:08,520
Okay.

181
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,056
Alright.

182
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,960
Okay, here we go.

183
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:27,972
Okay.
Almost there.

184
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,344
Almost there.

185
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,150
Oh!

186
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,954
<i>Ew. Ugh.</i>

187
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,489
I think you did it wrong.

188
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,625
Okay. Go inside.

189
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:49,994
Get cleaned up.

190
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:14,051
Yup.
I see what it is.

191
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,820
A little pre-show
entertainment..

192
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:21,593
<i>...for the future presentation.</i>

193
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:35,918
Ah..

194
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,590
Hey, what's going on?

195
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,625
Ah..

196
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:45,095
Ah, I just, uh..

197
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:48,230
I just thought I saw an animal.

198
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:50,900
Right. Okay.

199
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:53,068
Yeah.

200
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,606
Yeah, okay.

201
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:39,450
Uh-huh.

202
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,390
Shit.

203
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:53,930
Hey, kid! Yo!

204
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,998
Not a good idea, bud.

205
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,503
Just stay away from there,
alright?

206
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:01,204
Let's go.

207
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:06,074
Ah..

208
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,476
What are you doing over there?

209
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:09,712
I was just saying hi.

210
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:12,182
Hey, t... the lady
at the marina?

211
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:16,321
Sara?

212
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:19,424
I should meet her.

213
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:23,259
Okay.

214
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:26,662
Yeah, we'll do it... tonight.

215
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,598
Yeah, sure.

216
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,601
Cool.

217
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,135
Don't let that spill.

218
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:38,908
Shit.

219
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:48,784
<i>Hey.</i>

220
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:52,355
I don't think
you're supposed to be in here.

221
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:53,891
You're not that cute.

222
00:22:55,393 --> 00:22:57,225
Copy.
Hey, have you seen Casey?

223
00:22:57,227 --> 00:23:00,262
- No.
- Oh, shit. How do people like that get hired?

224
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:02,632
Lily, let's go. Mom's gonna be
here in a few to pick you up.

225
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:05,835
Come get your stuff.
Come on, come on, come on.

226
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:09,137
- <i>Hey, this guy at the club is freaking out here.</i>
- Yeah, I'll be there in five.

227
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,240
- Hey, can you pick, uh, help that guy, slip 12?
- Yeah.

228
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:13,643
- Bye!
- Thank you.

229
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:29,224
Okay, bud.

230
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:30,693
<i>Whoops.</i>

231
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,691
Whew, you're... you're packing.

232
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:04,192
Let's go inside
and change you, huh?

233
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,464
That sounds like fun.

234
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,040
- Oh!
- Hey, neighbor.

235
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:21,242
- How we doing over here?
- I was sleeping.

236
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:23,746
Yeah?
Not a fan of sailing?

237
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:25,614
<i>My dad wanted me to learn how.</i>

238
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:27,683
I wanted to go paddle boating.

239
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,487
This isn't paddle boating.

240
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:31,821
This sucks.

241
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:34,056
Let me tell you something.

242
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:37,026
There are popsicles

243
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,761
in the fridge in the cafeteria.

244
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:41,530
The deal is, you see anything
weird outside your house

245
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,601
you tell me, alright?

246
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:46,936
- Okay.
- Get out of here. Go.

247
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:50,706
Hello? Uh-huh.

248
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:55,446
Oh, hey, Sara wanted us to,
uh, pick up dinner rolls.

249
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:57,613
Yeah.

250
00:24:57,615 --> 00:25:00,616
Gluten-free. Uh-huh.

251
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:07,024
<i>Truce.</i>

252
00:25:16,968 --> 00:25:19,034
I'm guessing
these aren't gluten-free.

253
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:21,739
- What?
- Three dollars.

254
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:29,378
- Hey, mom.
- <i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

255
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,814
<i>Starting to think
you're forgetting about me.</i>

256
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:34,850
Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.

257
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:36,685
- I've been busy.
- <i>Making any new friends up..</i>

258
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,120
Going to a party tonight
if you want to come.

259
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:39,655
- Um, I can't tonight.
- <i>Any cuties?</i>

260
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:40,923
- You sure? You positive?
- Yeah.

261
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:42,324
- Mm-hmm.
- You don't want to come?

262
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:44,393
You wanna be boring and lame
forever?

263
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,530
- Okay.
- I, I just got here, but yeah.

264
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:50,399
<i>I miss my boys.</i>

265
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,002
<i>What are you guys up to
tonight?</i>

266
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:56,273
<i>Is your dad making
his world-famous Coney dogs?</i>

267
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:59,544
Um, I, uh..

268
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:02,279
- Hey! Wait!
- <i>Hey!</i>

269
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:03,581
<i>Hold up.</i>

270
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:08,452
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

271
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:25,534
Never have I ever been
skinny dipping.

272
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:28,639
Seriously, Dana?
You're so fucking lame.

273
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,710
<i>Alright, J.J.'s turn.</i>

274
00:26:34,712 --> 00:26:39,517
Never have I ever broken my arm.

275
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,619
- <i>Aww.</i>
- Drink! Drink!

276
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:46,121
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink!

277
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:48,757
- Alright.
- Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

278
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,526
- You do not have to drink that.
- Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

279
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:53,562
<i>Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!</i>

280
00:26:53,564 --> 00:26:55,431
- <i>Drink! Drink!</i>
- <i>Come on, drink it.</i>

281
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:57,334
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink!

282
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,505
There's barely any room on here.

283
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,576
How am I supposed to
fit my name?

284
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:10,145
- You gonna tell me?
- I don't even know you.

285
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:13,682
I can't go divulging
my darkest secrets.

286
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:16,051
I'm very trustworthy.

287
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,753
You're very drunk.

288
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:19,056
Mm.

289
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:24,462
I fell out of
a second-story window.

290
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,566
I snuck into my neighbor's house
to steal some Vicodin.

291
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:32,635
I went in the medicine cabinet

292
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:34,870
and... they came home

293
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:37,108
so I climbed out the window.

294
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:43,147
That's... how you broke your arm?

295
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:47,350
- You jumped?
- I guess.

296
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:49,151
I barely remember that part.

297
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:51,787
- It was kinda stupid.
- It sounds pretty stupid.

298
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:52,890
Mm.

299
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:55,824
Alright, okay, your turn.

300
00:27:55,826 --> 00:27:58,095
That is not the deal.

301
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,566
Ahh!

302
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,168
Fine.

303
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,507
This was a while ago.

304
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,711
Hannah Montana.

305
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,382
I, come on,
I, I bare my soul to you

306
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:20,883
and you give me Hannah Montana?

307
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:24,321
I wore an orange wig to school
all of fourth grade

308
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:27,058
and I made everybody call me
by my stage name.

309
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:31,994
Dakota Starcrush.

310
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:38,035
- And why? Why'd you stop?
- 'Cause the wig started to smell like butt.

311
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:42,905
That's pretty awesome.

312
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:44,742
You're pretty awesome.

313
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:48,610
Starkis crush, Starcrush.

314
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:30,614
Here.

315
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,917
It's water.

316
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,422
Here. Come on.

317
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:54,537
Are you coming?

318
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,641
I can't get my cast wet.

319
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:09,019
Shit.

320
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:15,659
Ooh, cold.

321
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:21,399
What's your name?

322
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:26,768
Whoa, hey, whoa.

323
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,772
Whoa, jeez. Ha.

324
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:33,144
- Come on.
- Now you've been skinny dipping.

325
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:36,981
Alright, okay, I get it.

326
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:43,020
Relax.

327
00:31:53,864 --> 00:31:55,232
Eyes closed.

328
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,441
I can hear you swimming.

329
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:05,843
Marco.

330
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:09,711
Polo.

331
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:11,914
Hey, there, turtle dick.

332
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,251
Little cold in there, buddy?

333
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:15,984
Just give me my shirt.

334
00:32:15,986 --> 00:32:18,022
Sorry.
It was just a dare.

335
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:22,258
You're such an asshole.

336
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,396
- <i>What? It's funny.</i>
- <i>You're just being a dick.</i>

337
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:31,403
Fuck off.

338
00:32:48,286 --> 00:32:49,254
Oh.

339
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:51,989
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

340
00:32:52,923 --> 00:32:54,624
I'm not tough as nails, mom.

341
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,024
Oh, it's okay, baby.

342
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:58,195
Come here.
Come in here.

343
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,168
- Better?
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:42,400
Hey.

345
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:57,313
Oh, God.
Hey, are you okay?

346
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:59,214
I've been looking all over
goddamn everywhere for you.

347
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:00,783
Hey, did you, did you see her?

348
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:02,251
What? Who?

349
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:04,356
It was the neighbor. I..

350
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:07,623
Where were you?

351
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,361
I was, I was at a party.

352
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:12,664
Come on.

353
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:15,467
<i>Ben!</i>

354
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:31,581
Sorry.

355
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,483
I had a terrible night,
if it's any consolation.

356
00:35:33,485 --> 00:35:35,217
I raised you better
than this shit. Come on, Ben.

357
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,520
- You're smarter than this.
- You and mom raised me.

358
00:35:37,522 --> 00:35:39,121
Maybe you both should
stop patting

359
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:40,490
yourselves on the backs,
alright?

360
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:42,891
I just missed
a stupid fucking dinner.

361
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,761
Sit!

362
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:46,094
You are going to apologize.

363
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:47,764
I said I'm sorry.

364
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,131
I'm going to bed.

365
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:52,502
You are gonna sit there
and apologize to Sara!

366
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:55,838
I'm not apologizing to some
bitch you're sleeping with.

367
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,309
I'm... just gonna head out.

368
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:05,113
I, um, I should go.
It's..

369
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:06,948
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>It's fine.</i>

370
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,384
<i>We'll talk tomorrow.</i>

371
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:10,555
You missed a good dinner.

372
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,448
Oh, shit.

373
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:16,184
<i>Baby, I gotta run.</i>

374
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,254
I'm gonna miss my charter.

375
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:20,055
Oh, someone needs a shower.

376
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:21,824
Hey, be good for mom.

377
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:23,026
Mm-hmm.

378
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:54,759
Hey, what's up, midget dick?

379
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:18,248
Gross.

380
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,398
Mom?

381
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:43,541
<i>Mom?</i>

382
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:49,514
Mom, one of the bunnies
are gone.

383
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:53,416
Mom?

384
00:38:58,022 --> 00:38:59,357
Mom?

385
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:45,235
Hey.

386
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,341
You lock up the boathouse?

387
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:54,209
<i>Yeah.</i>

388
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,480
Here.

389
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:58,716
Thanks.

390
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:01,753
You ready?

391
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,288
I... I still have all these
rental contracts to go through.

392
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,791
- I... I can walk.
- <i>No.</i>

393
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:10,459
I'll be done with this shit
in about an hour.

394
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:11,929
You can sit and wait.

395
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:14,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

396
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,032
The last of the charters came in

397
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:17,700
so I'm gonna head out.

398
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:18,968
Okay.

399
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,271
<i>Ah, Sara.</i>

400
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:22,940
Can I get a ride?

401
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:40,990
Ah, you know, I'm, like,
an amazing cook.

402
00:40:40,992 --> 00:40:45,594
<i>I can't have dairy anymore,
but I do a killer vegan.</i>

403
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:48,564
It's one of the reasons
that I'm awesome

404
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:52,537
and, uh, not just some bitch
your dad's sleeping with.

405
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:58,641
I, uh, I didn't..

406
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:00,311
Look, here's the deal.

407
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:04,146
I'm gonna give you a do-over.

408
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:09,420
Just... promise to give
the casserole a shot?

409
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:13,622
Deal.

410
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:14,826
Deal.

411
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:16,053
What are you doing up here?

412
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:19,690
<i>Dillon?</i>

413
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:21,826
<i>Don't let her in.</i>

414
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:24,762
Stay here.

415
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:40,845
Are your parents home?

416
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:42,947
Can I help you?

417
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:45,314
Hey, sweetie.

418
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:47,817
My son, he likes to play
hide and seek.

419
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,885
He's a handful.

420
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:51,088
Is he here?

421
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:55,491
No.

422
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,795
Just... just us.

423
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:02,231
Ah, if I see him

424
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,901
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

425
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:07,903
Can you bring him down?

426
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:11,008
I... I didn't say he was here.

427
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:14,777
Hey, whoa.

428
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:17,546
Hey, this is
private property, okay?

429
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:19,450
I decide if you come in.

430
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:24,254
You are a very stupid boy.

431
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:26,591
I'll snap that other arm.

432
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:32,063
Hey, I'm 17,
and you can get off my porch.

433
00:43:34,532 --> 00:43:35,933
<i>Baby?</i>

434
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:39,101
I came home,
and all the lights were off.

435
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:40,402
What's going on?

436
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:42,137
I'm looking for our son.

437
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:43,340
Dillon?

438
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:45,509
<i>Dad. Dad!</i>

439
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:48,210
Hey, pooper

440
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:49,612
what are you doing
all the way over here?

441
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:51,447
I want to go home.

442
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:52,681
Come on, baby.

443
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:17,640
Oh.

444
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:19,842
Hey, you, uh, you spooked me.

445
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:22,011
I... I thought I was
the only one here.

446
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:24,882
Hey, no worries.
It won't kill me.

447
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:36,727
<i>You good?</i>

448
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:38,763
Yeah.

449
00:44:40,064 --> 00:44:43,400
Ah... have a good night.

450
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:45,536
Yeah, you too.

451
00:44:46,137 --> 00:44:47,703
Alright.

452
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:49,540
Let's get cozy.

453
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:51,740
Okay.

454
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:54,645
Here we go, just like that.

455
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:58,849
Alright, night, bud.

456
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:00,584
Dad.

457
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:05,890
Mom's being... weird.

458
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:10,161
Ah, you should have seen her
at Burning Man.

459
00:45:11,263 --> 00:45:12,897
Mom's always been weird.

460
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:14,865
Sleep tight.

461
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:04,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

462
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:06,081
What you doin'?

463
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,318
Just, uh..

464
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,487
<i>Just watchin' Netflix.</i>

465
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:12,455
<i>You?</i>

466
00:46:12,457 --> 00:46:13,756
<i>Hung over.</i>

467
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:15,624
This fat kid ate
a whole microwave pizza

468
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:18,894
and now I'm eating your apology.

469
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:22,598
- <i>Cool.</i>
- <i>I am cool.</i>

470
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,000
<i>So is that, like, your thing?</i>

471
00:46:25,002 --> 00:46:26,869
Tell a girl a sob story,
puke on her

472
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,306
and then skinny dip with
the town ho?

473
00:46:31,742 --> 00:46:34,743
<i>Ben? Hello?</i>

474
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:36,881
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm here,
just, uh..

475
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:40,149
...this movie just got good.

476
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:44,254
<i>Ben..
Well, I can go if you're busy.</i>

477
00:46:44,256 --> 00:46:46,555
Ben? Ben?

478
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:48,692
<i>Ben, you home?</i>

479
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:32,203
You workin' today, idiot?

480
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:35,873
Yeah.

481
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:38,841
Yeah.

482
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:41,912
- What time is it?
- 11:00.

483
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:47,216
Where's, uh, where's Dillon?

484
00:47:47,218 --> 00:47:49,352
Who?

485
00:47:49,354 --> 00:47:50,986
Little blond kid.

486
00:47:50,988 --> 00:47:52,721
He had a lesson today at... at
10:00.

487
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:54,225
Oh, you're fine. He no-showed.

488
00:47:56,428 --> 00:47:58,861
Okay, bathroom's over there.

489
00:47:58,863 --> 00:47:59,928
What do you mean, no-showed?

490
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,966
- What?
- He didn't show up.

491
00:48:03,468 --> 00:48:06,135
I, um.. Look, I... I gotta go.

492
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:07,370
- What?
- I gotta go.

493
00:48:07,372 --> 00:48:08,704
Just cover for me, okay?

494
00:48:08,706 --> 00:48:11,073
Tell my, uh,
tell my dad somethin'.

495
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:12,042
Ben!

496
00:48:19,717 --> 00:48:20,885
Hello?

497
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:24,287
Can I help you?

498
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:26,589
Uh, yeah, is, uh,
is Dillon home?

499
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:27,992
He missed his lesson today.

500
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:31,793
What lesson?

501
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:33,195
I teach sailing at the marina.

502
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:35,164
He had a lesson this morning?

503
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,766
- You know, your son, Dillon?
- Uh, my son?

504
00:48:37,768 --> 00:48:39,271
I don't... I don't have a son.

505
00:48:40,738 --> 00:48:42,873
Dillon, your little boy.

506
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,575
Okay, what,
are you messing with me?

507
00:48:45,577 --> 00:48:47,042
I got no kids, kid.

508
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:50,280
Hey, look, look, you have a son,
alright? I've seen him.

509
00:48:50,282 --> 00:48:52,147
Look, man, I don't have time
to dink around.

510
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:54,286
Just get off my porch, okay?

511
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:11,296
Yup, your neighbors are
creepy as fuck.

512
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:16,965
- What're you doin'?
- <i>It's, like, a ward.</i>

513
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:18,470
<i>It stops, uh..</i>

514
00:50:19,803 --> 00:50:21,437
Who are you texting?

515
00:50:21,439 --> 00:50:24,641
Your dad, telling him you're at
home puking your guts out.

516
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:28,278
He was gonna drive over here,
but I told him I'd check on you.

517
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,816
<i>You're welcome.</i>

518
00:50:37,555 --> 00:50:38,556
<i>Now look.</i>

519
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:43,861
How many dead babies you think
she's got down there?

520
00:50:48,932 --> 00:50:50,100
God.

521
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:54,002
You're acting nutter-butters.

522
00:50:54,004 --> 00:50:56,204
You can't be like this
when your dad gets home.

523
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,481
Witchipedia?

524
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:09,719
I'm telling you,
something happened to Dillon.

525
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:11,356
He's gone. I know it.

526
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:15,258
Okay, maybe he's just staying
with family.

527
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,297
No. Why would you say you didn't
have a kid when you do?

528
00:51:20,598 --> 00:51:22,632
I don't know. Maybe he's
just a private person.

529
00:51:22,634 --> 00:51:23,601
No, Mal..

530
00:51:25,403 --> 00:51:29,272
He had no idea who
I was talking about.

531
00:51:29,274 --> 00:51:32,508
Like, he couldn't remember
his kid at all

532
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,344
and Dillon,
you should have seen him.

533
00:51:34,346 --> 00:51:36,914
He was fucking terrified
of his own mom.

534
00:51:41,118 --> 00:51:45,020
Okay. Um, so..

535
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:48,324
Maybe just go knock on her door

536
00:51:48,326 --> 00:51:50,092
and ask her if she could..

537
00:51:53,665 --> 00:51:55,600
Okay, that's just funny.

538
00:51:59,771 --> 00:52:04,041
<i>Okay, well, I have to go lock
up for your dad now.</i>

539
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:06,110
So..

540
00:52:09,314 --> 00:52:11,649
Have a good stakeout.

541
00:52:26,498 --> 00:52:29,166
<i>No, no, no, no, Mal,
what're you doin'?</i>

542
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:27,759
<i>Honey?</i>

543
00:53:31,629 --> 00:53:33,896
Beer?

544
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:38,101
Yeah, hey, did you see any kids
messin' with the cellar door?

545
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:36,592
- Oh, hey!
- Oh, hey, um..

546
00:54:36,594 --> 00:54:39,529
- Well, I'll lock up. Yeah.
- Oh, really? Alright, thanks.

547
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:41,129
I'm out for the night,
so have a good one.

548
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:43,468
- You too. See ya.
- Bye.

549
01:00:13,831 --> 01:00:15,731
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

550
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:18,701
Uh, I'd like to report a,
a missing kid..

551
01:00:18,703 --> 01:00:20,870
missing, a missing person.

552
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:22,204
<i>Okay, sir,
can you please provide me</i>

553
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:23,908
<i>with the name of the missing
person?</i>

554
01:00:25,843 --> 01:00:27,144
<i>Sir?</i>

555
01:00:28,546 --> 01:00:30,412
<i>Sir?</i>

556
01:00:30,414 --> 01:00:33,484
- <i>Sir?</i>
- Shit. Shit. Shit.

557
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,223
- <i>Hey.</i>
- <i>Mal, she's after your sister!</i>

558
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:43,158
<i>What? Are you okay, Ben?</i>

559
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,693
- <i>What is this?</i>
- Your sister!

560
01:00:44,695 --> 01:00:46,428
She's after her!
Where is Lily?

561
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,165
- Is she with you?
- <i>Who's Lily?</i>

562
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,167
Shit!

563
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:56,474
<i>Mal!</i>

564
01:00:57,675 --> 01:01:00,009
Mal, watch me do the slide.

565
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:02,845
This time you guys are puttin'
the worms on your own hooks.

566
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,981
Mal!

567
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,215
Ugh!

568
01:01:40,217 --> 01:01:42,818
You dump that shit
in my dad's boat?

569
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,819
Huh?

570
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:45,022
You piece of shit!

571
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:49,792
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>Come on. Get off me!</i>

572
01:01:49,794 --> 01:01:51,361
- Come on! Come on!
- Hey!

573
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:52,863
- <i>Stop!</i>
- Ugh!

574
01:01:59,603 --> 01:02:00,771
Lily!

575
01:02:05,377 --> 01:02:06,544
Lily!

576
01:02:09,046 --> 01:02:10,079
Lily?

577
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:12,284
Lily!

578
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:16,053
<i>Lily!</i>

579
01:02:22,026 --> 01:02:22,994
Oh, God, Lily.

580
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:30,699
- Pull.
- Ah!

581
01:02:34,406 --> 01:02:35,573
Ah!

582
01:03:29,394 --> 01:03:30,926
Do you know all of his friends?

583
01:03:30,928 --> 01:03:32,529
Is there anyone new
he's been hanging out with?

584
01:03:32,531 --> 01:03:34,364
No, he doesn't know anybody.
He just moved here.

585
01:03:34,366 --> 01:03:35,866
- He just..
- Dad?

586
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:39,770
I don't remember.
I don't..

587
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:43,207
You were supposed to
stay in your room.

588
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:48,346
We'll give you some privacy.

589
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:02,093
You okay?

590
01:04:03,861 --> 01:04:08,264
- Yeah. Uh, I'm fine.
- <i>Good.</i>

591
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:11,301
You broke into
the neighbor's house.

592
01:04:11,303 --> 01:04:13,635
You beat up some kid
at the marina.

593
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:15,737
No, dad, I didn't beat up..

594
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:17,106
You... you don't understand.

595
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:19,243
God, I can't,
you're lying to me!

596
01:04:21,245 --> 01:04:23,178
- You on something?
- No, dad, it's not..

597
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,716
She killed her kids.
She took Lily.

598
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:30,619
- What are you talking about?
- The lady next door, alright?

599
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:33,456
She's... she's doing shit,
making people forget people..

600
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,892
You mean Abbie, the nice woman
whose house you broke into?

601
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:39,562
No, she's making people
forget about their kids.

602
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:40,662
Oh, my God.
I'm not listening.

603
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:42,332
Just look in her cellar.

604
01:04:42,334 --> 01:04:44,233
Dad, I promise,
just ask Mal, okay?

605
01:04:44,235 --> 01:04:45,535
- Stop it. Stop it!
- She won't even know...

606
01:04:45,537 --> 01:04:46,704
Ben, this is done!

607
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:49,638
Okay?

608
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,907
I talked to your mother

609
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:54,410
and I am taking you home

610
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:56,211
and we're gonna f..

611
01:04:56,213 --> 01:04:58,914
we're gonna find you
a clinic, okay?

612
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,517
And we're gonna get you
some help

613
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:03,185
because this isn't working.

614
01:05:03,187 --> 01:05:04,989
- Dad..
- <i>Mr. Shaw?</i>

615
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:07,892
<i>Can I have a word?</i>

616
01:05:09,126 --> 01:05:10,094
Yeah.

617
01:05:11,263 --> 01:05:12,229
Don't move.

618
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:15,864
<i>Alright, well, your neighbors
aren't interested</i>

619
01:05:15,866 --> 01:05:17,333
<i>in pressing any charges</i>

620
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:19,304
<i>so long as he
stays off their property.</i>

621
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:27,477
Your dad really loves you.

622
01:05:27,479 --> 01:05:28,511
You know that, right?

623
01:05:28,513 --> 01:05:31,146
Yeah, yeah, that's great, yeah.

624
01:05:31,148 --> 01:05:32,948
What I need is for him to
believe me.

625
01:05:33,984 --> 01:05:35,853
I think you have to earn that.

626
01:05:41,493 --> 01:05:44,195
I'm sorry.
That's... that's not my place.

627
01:05:45,796 --> 01:05:48,096
Look, I really care about
your dad

628
01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:49,798
and I'm sorry
if I had anything to do

629
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,800
with this... this whole mess.

630
01:05:51,802 --> 01:05:53,369
No, it's..

631
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:55,271
...that's not the point.

632
01:05:55,273 --> 01:05:58,541
It's.. I just..
I don't know, you..

633
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,066
I like this house.

634
01:06:42,786 --> 01:06:44,387
Ben!

635
01:06:44,389 --> 01:06:47,423
- Ah!
- Stop! Oh, my God!

636
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:53,463
What the hell did you do?

637
01:06:53,465 --> 01:06:56,932
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Shh, you okay?

638
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:58,102
<i>No!</i>

639
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:00,438
Ow!

640
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:18,721
Dad! Dad!

641
01:07:18,723 --> 01:07:19,988
Dad..

642
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,725
Ben, I'll meet you
at the station.

643
01:07:22,727 --> 01:07:26,094
No! Dad, she's not Sara, dad.

644
01:07:26,096 --> 01:07:27,996
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

645
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:29,632
Look in the cellar, dad.

646
01:07:29,634 --> 01:07:31,534
Go look in the cellar!

647
01:07:31,536 --> 01:07:32,901
Dad!

648
01:07:32,903 --> 01:07:34,970
She's not Sara!

649
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:36,972
He's just high, alright?

650
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,142
Give him some time.

651
01:07:43,315 --> 01:07:45,715
- Let's roll.
- Dad! Dad!

652
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:57,161
Sara?

653
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:01,631
Hey..

654
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:03,999
...I'm headed to the station.

655
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:05,934
- <i>Do you mind?</i>
- Wha..

656
01:08:05,936 --> 01:08:07,272
I could use a drink.

657
01:08:11,443 --> 01:08:13,108
Sure.

658
01:08:40,538 --> 01:08:42,204
<i>Here you go.</i>

659
01:08:42,206 --> 01:08:44,574
<i>I'm really sorry about Ben.</i>

660
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:45,543
I gotta go.

661
01:08:47,545 --> 01:08:49,144
Don't leave.

662
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:51,616
- I really gotta go.
- Okay.

663
01:08:57,054 --> 01:08:58,390
I have to go.

664
01:09:25,417 --> 01:09:28,049
<i>Hey, Liam Shaw.
Leave a message.</i>

665
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:31,754
Hey, Liam.
Um, just about done.

666
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:34,724
Um, I, um..

667
01:09:34,726 --> 01:09:36,626
Hope everything's okay.

668
01:09:36,628 --> 01:09:40,732
Just wanted to see
if you've heard from Ben.

669
01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:43,233
Let me know.

670
01:09:54,379 --> 01:09:56,512
Hey,
w... where are we goin', man?

671
01:09:56,514 --> 01:09:58,215
<i>Aren't we goin' to the station?</i>

672
01:10:11,563 --> 01:10:12,795
<i>Hey.</i>

673
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:14,566
Hey, what're we doin' here?

674
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:24,440
<i>Hey, man, what're we doin'?</i>

675
01:10:24,442 --> 01:10:27,142
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Ahh, ahh! Argh!</i>

676
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:29,044
<i>What're you doin'? God!</i>

677
01:10:29,046 --> 01:10:30,078
<i>Let me go!</i>

678
01:11:11,322 --> 01:11:13,725
<i>No! No! No!</i>

679
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:18,193
- <i>No!</i>
- Ah!

680
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,932
Ah! No!

681
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,345
Whoa, whoa, hey!
Hey, come on.

682
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:38,314
Please, I'm sorry.

683
01:11:40,685 --> 01:11:42,050
Please, no, no, no.

684
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:43,553
Please, it's okay.

685
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:47,559
No! No!

686
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:00,491
Jesus.

687
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:47,456
- Hey! God!
- Oh!

688
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:50,327
Oh, my God, dad, are you okay?

689
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:51,527
<i>We gotta get you out of here.</i>

690
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:05,674
Dad, we gotta get..
We gotta get out of here, okay?

691
01:17:05,676 --> 01:17:07,910
- Aah!
- Come on.

692
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:55,927
<i>You're quite the little artist.</i>

693
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,464
Thank you.

694
01:18:02,466 --> 01:18:03,634
<i>You hear that?</i>

695
01:18:05,337 --> 01:18:06,735
I love that.

696
01:18:06,737 --> 01:18:09,004
<i>It's just crickets, dad.</i>

697
01:18:09,006 --> 01:18:12,041
- Try me, B.
- <i>He's gone. I know it.</i>

698
01:18:12,043 --> 01:18:13,943
Are mom and dad gonna
get divorced?

699
01:18:13,945 --> 01:18:15,678
<i>She's making people
forget people.</i>

700
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,246
Okay, what,
are you messin' with me?

701
01:18:17,248 --> 01:18:18,614
I got no kids, kid.

702
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:20,883
- Are your parents home?
- <i>Can I help you?</i>

703
01:18:20,885 --> 01:18:22,851
- Ben?
- Hey, sweetie.

704
01:18:22,853 --> 01:18:24,553
<i>I like this house.</i>

705
01:18:24,555 --> 01:18:26,356
You were supposed to stay
in your room.

706
01:18:26,358 --> 01:18:28,893
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- <i>We'll give you some privacy.</i>

707
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:31,860
<i>Hey, whoa.</i>

708
01:18:31,862 --> 01:18:35,199
You're a very stupid boy,
boy, boy..

709
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:39,568
<i>Help!</i>

710
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:41,236
<i>Help!</i>

711
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:42,604
Hey, hey, hey.

712
01:18:42,606 --> 01:18:43,841
I'm gonna go get Nathan.

713
01:18:46,844 --> 01:18:47,676
Nathan!

714
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,863
<i>Ben!</i>

715
01:19:07,865 --> 01:19:09,900
- Where's my sister?
- <i>Mal, uh..</i>

716
01:19:10,901 --> 01:19:12,603
Just take this, okay?

717
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:16,105
- Hey!
- <i>Nathan!</i>

718
01:19:16,107 --> 01:19:17,074
<i>Nathan!</i>

719
01:19:18,642 --> 01:19:20,642
<i>Help!</i>

720
01:19:20,644 --> 01:19:21,912
<i>Nathan!</i>

721
01:19:28,552 --> 01:19:30,085
Where is she?
Where's Lily?

722
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:32,288
I don't know. I don't know.
I tried to save her.

723
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:33,323
Ben!

724
01:19:33,325 --> 01:19:34,990
Look, take that salt

725
01:19:34,992 --> 01:19:36,292
and I want you to pour it around
the tree, alright?

726
01:19:36,294 --> 01:19:37,893
It's gonna trap her.

727
01:19:37,895 --> 01:19:39,895
What do you mean, you tried to
save her? What's going on?

728
01:19:39,897 --> 01:19:43,065
I need you to tell me
what's going on!

729
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:46,835
It took Lily,
and it's got my brother.

730
01:19:46,837 --> 01:19:48,537
- I have to go.
- What took them?

731
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:49,705
What're you talking about?

732
01:19:49,707 --> 01:19:51,206
Make a salt circle
around the tree

733
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,609
and if I'm not back in
ten minutes, burn it.

734
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:54,777
Ben.

735
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:56,281
Ten minutes,
and you do it, okay?

736
01:21:42,186 --> 01:21:43,154
<i>Nathan.</i>

737
01:21:47,592 --> 01:21:49,526
Hey, buddy.

738
01:21:49,528 --> 01:21:50,728
Hey.

739
01:21:51,962 --> 01:21:53,898
Okay,
I need you to wake up, buddy.

740
01:21:57,968 --> 01:21:59,335
- Ben?
- Hey.

741
01:21:59,337 --> 01:22:01,038
We're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

742
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:04,940
I want you to get up. Okay.

743
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:06,975
<i>Ready to go?
Ready to go home?</i>

744
01:22:06,977 --> 01:22:09,914
<i>I need you to keep goin', and
I'll be right behind you, okay?</i>

745
01:22:56,428 --> 01:22:57,826
Go, go, go, go, go.

746
01:22:57,828 --> 01:22:58,996
Shit.

747
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:10,107
Oh!

748
01:23:20,619 --> 01:23:22,487
- Ben!
- <i>Ah!</i>

749
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:33,363
Go, go!

750
01:23:46,478 --> 01:23:47,610
Are you alright?

751
01:23:49,813 --> 01:23:51,081
Let's go, come on.

752
01:24:00,358 --> 01:24:01,359
<i>Mal!</i>

753
01:24:04,228 --> 01:24:06,663
- Pull yourself up.
- Come here.

754
01:24:08,065 --> 01:24:09,599
Come on. Okay.

755
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:10,568
Come here.

756
01:24:15,307 --> 01:24:17,239
- You okay? Okay.
- Yeah.

757
01:24:17,241 --> 01:24:19,377
Alright, stand back, over here.

758
01:24:21,211 --> 01:24:22,179
Ben!

759
01:24:23,315 --> 01:24:24,282
<i>Ben!</i>

760
01:24:48,473 --> 01:24:49,441
Lily!

761
01:24:51,909 --> 01:24:53,276
Lily, oh, my God.

762
01:24:53,278 --> 01:24:54,912
I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?

763
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:03,720
Come on, you gotta,
you gotta wake up, okay?

764
01:25:03,722 --> 01:25:05,256
Lily, open your eyes.

765
01:25:10,562 --> 01:25:12,364
You gotta wake up, okay?

766
01:25:14,432 --> 01:25:16,499
- I don't feel good.
- Okay.

767
01:25:16,501 --> 01:25:18,701
Hey, hey, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine, alright?

768
01:25:18,703 --> 01:25:19,671
We're gonna get you out of here.

769
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,607
Okay. Okay, here we go.

770
01:25:45,263 --> 01:25:47,195
Come on, let's go! Come on!

771
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:52,637
Ben!

772
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:59,074
Mal!

773
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:00,244
<i>Lily!</i>

774
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:06,482
Okay. Go that way.

775
01:26:06,484 --> 01:26:07,884
Go back to the house,
and wait for me.

776
01:26:07,886 --> 01:26:09,786
- Now!
- Okay.

777
01:26:12,524 --> 01:26:14,659
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Go!

778
01:26:23,033 --> 01:26:24,065
Ah!

779
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:48,493
Mom, we're headed out.

780
01:26:56,668 --> 01:26:59,602
<i>I'm doing pretty good,
considering..</i>

781
01:26:59,604 --> 01:27:03,372
<i>Uh, Lily's getting better every
day, some nightmares.</i>

782
01:27:03,374 --> 01:27:06,342
<i>It's expected. People died.</i>

783
01:27:06,344 --> 01:27:09,414
It's a lot to process,
especially for someone her age.

784
01:27:11,114 --> 01:27:13,649
Uh, before you go,
I... I wanted to, um..

785
01:27:13,651 --> 01:27:15,318
I wanted to ask you
about something

786
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,656
that your sister
said her last session.

787
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,290
<i>She said..</i>

788
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:23,428
<i>...you had to burn the tree.</i>

789
01:27:24,729 --> 01:27:26,127
<i>What tree?</i>

790
01:27:28,633 --> 01:27:30,768
<i>Do you have any idea
what she's talking about?</i>

791
01:27:36,941 --> 01:27:38,108
Mallory?

792
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:42,678
Um..

793
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,649
Sounds like
one of her nightmares.

794
01:28:06,437 --> 01:28:07,837
Alright, hold on, team.

795
01:28:07,839 --> 01:28:09,639
Wait for the rest of us.

796
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:10,608
Let's go.

797
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:19,551
<i>Hey, Starcrush.</i>

798
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:22,787
Headed out?

799
01:28:23,721 --> 01:28:25,222
Yeah, headin' home.

800
01:28:26,558 --> 01:28:28,958
- Hey! Hm-hmm.
- <i>So..</i>

801
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,526
Your mom and dad?

802
01:28:30,528 --> 01:28:33,262
Nah, no, she's just, uh..

803
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:35,096
She's just driving back with us.

804
01:28:35,098 --> 01:28:36,267
- Cool.
- Yeah.

805
01:28:37,435 --> 01:28:40,505
Well, good luck with..

806
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:42,838
...everything.

807
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:46,711
Thanks. You too, you know,
with the rest of your summer.

808
01:28:48,513 --> 01:28:49,514
Cool.

809
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:52,383
Alright, well..

810
01:28:54,184 --> 01:28:55,751
<i>Adios, muchacho?</i>

811
01:28:55,753 --> 01:28:57,255
Yeah, okay.

812
01:29:05,296 --> 01:29:07,432
That is from Lily.

813
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:14,739
That's from me.

814
01:29:18,276 --> 01:29:20,278
Take care of yourself, Ben.

815
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:22,914
Don't forget me.

816
01:29:28,519 --> 01:29:31,587
Alright, who's ready to go?

817
01:29:31,589 --> 01:29:33,422
- Hey.
- Hey, stud muffin.

818
01:29:33,424 --> 01:29:35,057
- You ready?
- Yeah.

819
01:29:35,059 --> 01:29:37,059
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

820
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:38,928
Hey, so when we get back,
I kinda thought..

821
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:42,965
Listen, I think I'm gonna stay
with your Uncle Rory

822
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:45,166
for a couple of weeks,
until this heals up

823
01:29:45,168 --> 01:29:47,570
and, you know, until your mom
and I can figure things out.

824
01:29:47,572 --> 01:29:50,171
Hey, however it works out, dad.

825
01:29:50,173 --> 01:29:51,342
It's fine.

826
01:29:52,543 --> 01:29:53,409
Alright.

827
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,313
Oh!

828
01:29:57,315 --> 01:29:59,415
- You good?
- Ow.

829
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:01,617
<i>So this is Ben's car now?</i>

830
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:04,553
- <i>She's pretty.</i>
- <i>Ow.</i>

831
01:30:04,555 --> 01:30:06,455
<i>Something to know
about your dad</i>

832
01:30:06,457 --> 01:30:09,792
<i>is that he's a huge baby
when it comes to pain.</i>

833
01:30:09,794 --> 01:30:11,394
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

834
01:30:11,396 --> 01:30:13,194
<i>I got a lot of boo-boos here.</i>

835
01:30:36,821 --> 01:30:40,291
It's a magic fairy.

836
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:45,596
It is.. It is a spider.

837
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:54,972
This is a cockroach.
