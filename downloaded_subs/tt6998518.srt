<i>There's a great
spiritual awakening in America.</i>

3
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,096
<i>A renewal of
the traditional values</i>

4
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:34,763
<i>that have been the bedrock</i>

5
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:36,666
<i>of America's goodness
and greatness.</i>

00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,301
<i>An overwhelming majority

8
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,294
Knock, knock.

9
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,699
You scared the hell out of me.

10
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:47,236
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

11
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,205
Erik Estrada.

12
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,674
Erik Estrada who?

13
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:54,245
Erik Estrada from "CHiPs."

14
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,385
What are you drawing?

15
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:04,820
Uh, it's kind of like,
um, jungle temple.

16
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,356
Oh, that's... that's...
I mean, that's...

17
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:08,693
Wow.

18
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,366
How was your day?

19
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,736
It was pretty cool.

20
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:56,041
I was reading that book
about the galaxy.

21
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,812
That big, thick one?

22
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,683
Yeah.
It's pretty awesome.

23
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,953
What's your favorite planet?

24
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,356
Jupiter.

25
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,457
Yeah, no doubt.

26
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:16,995
Jupiter.

27
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:19,865
How come?

28
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:22,000
Mm...

29
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,467
Well, because the surface
of its atmosphere

30
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:30,974
is a storm that's been raging
for, like, 1,000 years,

31
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,976
and the eye of the hurricane
is so huge

32
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:35,414
that it could just
swallow the whole Earth.

33
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:38,881
Yeah. That's...
That's my favorite planet.

34
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,985
- That's wild.
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,724
What's yours?

36
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,429
Um...

37
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,997
Saturn, probably.

38
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,533
Yeah?

39
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,967
Saturn's pretty cool,

40
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,303
and that was one of the first
ones that we discovered,

41
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,039
that humans discovered,
so there's, like,

42
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,779
a lot of cool ancient myths
about it and stuff.

43
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,952
I changed my mind.

44
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:16,385
What?

45
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:18,290
I like Galactus.

46
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,091
Galactus isn't a planet.

47
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:25,294
Yeah, but he eats planets.

48
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,966
Woof. Woof, woof, woof.

49
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:18,564
Hey.
Are you awake?

50
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:22,434
Yeah, baby.
What is it?

51
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:27,171
You were having a bad dream.

52
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:29,675
Uh-huh.

53
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,444
What was it about?

54
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:40,118
I can't remember.

55
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:48,659
Sometimes I wonder if we should
move away from this place.

56
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,832
Where?

57
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,469
I don't know.

58
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:01,139
No.

59
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,142
I like it here.

60
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,778
It's peaceful here, right?
This is, like, our little...

61
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,749
This is our little home.

62
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,888
Did I ever tell you
about the starlings

63
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,626
when I was a little kid?

64
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,227
No. I don't think so.

65
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:26,862
In the neighborhood
where I grew up,

66
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:30,533
there were all these starlings
flying around in the trees,

67
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:33,137
playing and chirping,
and they were so cute.

68
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,342
But my dad...

69
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,577
...he just hated them

70
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,084
'cause they were always eating
cherries from the cherry tree.

71
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,555
Anyway, one day...

72
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,823
One day, me and a bunch of the
other kids from the neighborhood

73
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:56,094
were playing in this empty lot.

74
00:14:57,161 --> 00:15:02,533
And my dad came walking across
with a pillowcase...

75
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,571
...and a crowbar.

76
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:10,606
And there was something moving
around inside of the pillowcase,

77
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,377
like, squirming around.

78
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:17,646
And he said we should
gather 'round.

79
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:21,516
He had something to show us,
and so we all gathered 'round,

80
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:25,224
and he emptied what was in
the pillowcase on the ground.

81
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,327
And it was a...

82
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:35,901
It was a bunch
of baby starlings.

83
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:41,572
And he told us that he was gonna
show us how to kill them.

84
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,181
And he lifted
the crowbar up real high...

85
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,353
...and then...

86
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:59,925
...brought it down real hard
on the little baby bird.

87
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:09,598
So hard that it pushed it
in the ground.

88
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,537
It was so deep in there,
like a little grave, you know?

89
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:25,247
And then he gave the crowbar
to one of the kids, and then...

90
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,384
each kid took a turn in...

91
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:30,355
killing a starling.

92
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,267
What'd you do?

93
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:49,273
I, um...

94
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,617
...just watched, and then when
it was my turn, I just ran away.

95
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:07,559
Oh, baby.

96
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,262
Come here.

97
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:36,688
<i>"Under the crimson,
primordial sky...</i>

98
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,389
<i>...surrounded by
the jagged rocks</i>

99
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:43,592
<i>of the ancient
volcanic mountain,</i>

100
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,428
<i>the wretched Warlock</i>

101
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,465
<i>reached into the dark embrace
of the fissure</i>

102
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:53,034
<i>until his hand touched
a smooth glassy surface.</i>

103
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,736
<i>Cold as ice.</i>

104
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:58,774
<i>His fist closed around
The Serpent's Eye.</i>

105
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:02,911
<i>Slowly he withdrew it
and held it before him</i>

106
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:06,550
<i>in the fading light
of the blood-red suns.</i>

107
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,488
<i>It glowed from within.</i>

108
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:14,693
<i>A ghostly emerald light.</i>

109
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:20,299
<i>Strange and eternal."</i>

110
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:38,863
What's the matter, Jeremiah?

111
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,767
Are you all right?

112
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,636
No.

113
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm not all right.

114
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,210
Did I do something wrong?

115
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,651
Wrong?

116
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:06,123
Everything you do is wrong.

117
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,594
I'm so sorry, Jeremiah.

118
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:19,767
Is there anything I can do
to make you feel better?

119
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:23,541
There is nothing you can do.

120
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,113
It's her.

121
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:34,382
I feel naked without her.

122
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:36,054
Naked.

123
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:41,560
Do you hear me?

124
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,226
I-I...

125
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:47,729
I said, "Do you hear me?"

126
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,665
Yes, Jeremiah.
I hear you.

127
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,800
"Yes, Jeremiah.

128
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:54,736
I hear you."
Really?

129
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:59,944
Because, sometimes, I don't
think you hear anything at all.

130
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:05,350
And I am truly
worried about that.

131
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:11,957
If you are not with me,
you will not ascend.

132
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:20,396
- Jeremiah, I...
- Please...

133
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:26,067
just be quiet
and go fetch me Brother Swan.

134
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:27,835
Okay.

135
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:32,911
I said,
"Go fetch me Brother Swan."

136
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,334
There you are.

137
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:02,740
What can I do for you, Jeremiah?

138
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:07,842
I need you to get me
that girl I saw.

139
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:09,381
I need her.

140
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:13,148
I need her now.

141
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,055
Jeremiah, consider it done.

142
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:24,796
Do you have the Horn of Abraxas?

143
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,762
Do you know what to do?

144
00:24:58,328 --> 00:24:59,863
I do.

145
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:03,000
Hey.

146
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:07,906
Why don't we offer up
the porker, too?

147
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,974
Just to seal the deal.

148
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,379
That is such a good idea.

149
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:21,719
That lard-ass, he couldn't
find his nose in a mirror.

150
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,368
I knew I could count on you.

151
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:45,442
I can always count on you.

152
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:47,779
Buddy.

153
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,880
Oh, thank you, Jeremiah.

154
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:54,219
Thank you.

155
00:25:58,354 --> 00:26:00,024
Before you go...

156
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,161
...send in Sister Lucy.

157
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,436
Of course.

158
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,243
That's a cool T-shirt.

159
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,546
Oh, thanks.

160
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:00,916
What you reading?

161
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:02,551
A novel.

162
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:03,854
Oh.

163
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:06,356
How do you like it?

164
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:10,594
Yeah, I think it's
Lenora Tor's best book.

165
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:15,033
Hmm.

166
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,667
I guess you live around here.

167
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:22,974
Yeah. We live just down
near Crystal Lake.

168
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:26,443
Oh, that sounds lovely.

169
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:32,514
It's 5 bucks.

170
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:33,852
Oh, yeah.

171
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,433
Well...

172
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,976
See you later.

173
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:26,371
Are you sure
this is the right place?

174
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:29,274
Yes. Of course I am.

175
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,368
What now?

176
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,407
Now we wait.

177
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:32,621
How long?

178
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:34,225
Shh.

179
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:40,565
Listen.

180
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:19,422
Blood for blood.

181
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,330
More.

182
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,942
First things first.

183
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,875
<i>Aah!</i>

184
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:43,980
<i>Aaaah!</i>

185
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:47,051
<i>Jerry? Jesus Christ.</i>

186
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:54,959
- <i>What the hell is that?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

187
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,734
<i>Oh!</i>

188
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:26,536
Don't worry.

189
00:38:29,105 --> 00:38:31,575
Those scary men are gone now.

190
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:37,014
They got what they came for,
and they're gone.

191
00:38:42,618 --> 00:38:44,921
I guess you're wondering
where your hubby is.

192
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:49,158
Don't you worry.
He's just fine.

193
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:55,763
And he'll stay that way
as long as you're a good girl

194
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:57,600
and do as you're told.

195
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,580
Do you understand me?

196
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:15,750
You know, he thinks
you're so special,

197
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:18,719
and I hope you realize
what that means.

198
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:21,792
The responsibility
is on you, buster.

199
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:41,775
Open.

200
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:48,251
Very good.

201
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:52,289
Very good.

202
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,674
Hold still.

203
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,277
Hold still.

204
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:35,132
I like to call that
the cherry on top.

205
00:40:40,136 --> 00:40:42,672
It's all but a beautiful dream.

206
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,377
A dream he's having right now.

207
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:54,283
Won't you join us in that dream?

208
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:24,842
I'm sorry for all
this fuss and muss.

209
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:32,115
But when I saw you
on the road the other day...

210
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:37,921
...you called out to me...

211
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:41,892
...silently.

212
00:42:44,493 --> 00:42:45,995
And I listened.

213
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,201
Look at me.

214
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:56,039
Look at me!

215
00:42:58,507 --> 00:42:59,977
Tell me.

216
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:03,247
What do you see?

217
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:16,426
I see the reaper
fast approaching.

218
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:23,163
Well, I recognized you,

219
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:27,571
so I think in time...

220
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:31,408
...you will recognize me.

221
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:36,243
You know,

222
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:40,348
all he wants is for his children

223
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,319
to love one another.

224
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:54,395
Now, I find that he allows me

225
00:43:54,397 --> 00:44:01,034
to express that love
in many ways,

226
00:44:01,036 --> 00:44:05,475
but one of those ways...

227
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,478
...is music.

228
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:14,183
Do you like the Carpenters?

229
00:44:15,384 --> 00:44:19,920
I think that
they're sensational,

230
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:25,062
but this is even better.

231
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:45,147
What do you think?

232
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:50,921
Shh. Shh. Wait.

233
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:54,257
It's about to start.

00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:30,357

00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,659
with the great,
grand glittery ones,

241
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:35,161
but those scumbags
couldn't recognize

242
00:45:35,163 --> 00:45:36,998
a golden, radiant light

243
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,036
even as it was cast
right down upon them.

244
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,339
But thankfully...

245
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:48,477
Thankfully,
he showed me another path.

246
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:54,448
The path I have always
been truly destined for,

247
00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:01,621
something far greater
than mere fame or fortune.

252
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:22,678
When I was at the bottom
of the pit...

253
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,084
...screaming in the darkness...

254
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:32,022
...racked with
unspeakable pain...

255
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:37,094
...for having been denied
all that was rightfully mine...

256
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:44,034
...he graced me with his light.

257
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:51,575
His hot loving light.

258
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:59,315
It flowed over me like
the pulse of a timeless wave.

259
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:05,187
A wave of pure heat.

260
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:14,797
A mainline of pure
and total acceptance.

261
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:21,437
And he talked to me.

262
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:26,475
Addressed me as a friend.

263
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:34,683
He said, "Jeremiah,
they were wrong.

264
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:40,056
And you are right.

265
00:47:42,257 --> 00:47:44,694
So right."

266
00:47:46,828 --> 00:47:50,132
And he blessed me
with his holy kiss.

267
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:59,176
He said, "You are not separate
from all that is.

268
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:02,745
So all that is...

269
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:05,848
...is yours."

270
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:11,784
And he gave me his deepest
and warmest permission

271
00:48:11,786 --> 00:48:14,455
to go out into this world

272
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:19,096
and take what is
so very much mine.

273
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:23,797
All of it.

274
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:25,134
Mine.

275
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:28,402
My wants.

276
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:30,273
My needs.

277
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:32,843
My pleasures.

278
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:47,724
You know...

279
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:54,331
...I've been blessed to know
the comfort of many women.

280
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:59,435
But there are few
that have had your radiance.

281
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:03,906
You're a special one, Mandy.

282
00:49:04,674 --> 00:49:07,744
I, too, am a special one.

283
00:49:09,745 --> 00:49:15,685
Let us be so very special
together.

284
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:20,556
Be gentle...

285
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,492
...like me.

286
00:49:36,939 --> 00:49:38,375
They...

287
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,878
You made this song?

288
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,585
Yes.

289
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:51,321
I did.

290
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:58,594
And it's about you?

291
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:02,364
Yes.

292
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:05,501
It is.

293
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:40,237
Shut up!

294
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:42,402
Shut up!

295
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:47,040
Shut up!
Shut up!

296
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:49,643
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

297
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:52,612
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

298
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:56,685
Don't you fucking look at me!

299
00:50:57,585 --> 00:50:59,453
Don't you fucking look at me!

300
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,388
Don't look at me!
Don't you fucking look at me!

301
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,656
Don't look at me!

302
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,625
Tell me what to do.

303
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:40,864
Please tell me what to do.

304
00:51:41,629 --> 00:51:43,864
Come on.
Tell me what to do.

305
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:46,533
Tell me what to do.
Tell me. Tell me.

306
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:48,835
Tell me what to do.
Tell me what to do.

307
00:51:48,837 --> 00:51:50,937
Tell me what to do.
Tell me what to do.

308
00:51:50,939 --> 00:51:53,841
Tell me what to do.
Tell me. Tell me.

309
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:56,779
Tell me. Tell me.

310
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:13,962
Don't ever doubt yourself.

311
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,387
You and that ugly little whore.

312
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:45,761
You think you're so in love?

313
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,933
I'll show you love.

314
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,102
Lucy.

315
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:03,747
Kneel.

316
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:31,908
Now show him
how much you love me.

317
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:36,179
No.

318
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:46,620
No.

319
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:06,843
Another pearl wasted
before swine.

320
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:10,213
Yeah.

321
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:17,821
Take a good look, you worthless
piece of human excrement.

322
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:24,824
This is the tainted blade
of the pale knight,

323
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:27,663
straight from the abyssal layer.

324
00:54:38,306 --> 00:54:41,143
Poor, stupid pigs.

325
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:47,816
Born without souls.

326
00:55:09,337 --> 00:55:13,743
You know what Jesus'
big mistake was? Huh?

327
00:55:15,877 --> 00:55:19,745
He didn't offer up
a sacrifice in his stead.

328
00:55:19,747 --> 00:55:24,286
The cruciform is a constant
reminder of that.

329
00:55:39,134 --> 00:55:45,708
Now, we wasted the chemist's
finest on your whore.

330
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:49,009
But I think that you both

331
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:53,917
shall see the cleansing
power of fire...

332
00:55:57,352 --> 00:55:59,655
...cannot be reasoned with.

333
00:58:33,808 --> 00:58:38,080
The darker the whore,
the brighter the flame.

334
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:35,430
<i>Who ate all
the macaroni and cheese?</i>

335
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:41,833
<i>Cheddar Goblin, did you eat
all the macaroni and cheese?</i>

336
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:44,270
<i>Nothing's better than cheddar.</i>

337
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:46,471
<i>Cheddar Goblin.</i>

<i>has 60% more cheese

340
01:05:57,685 --> 01:06:01,353
<i>Kids and goblins agree,
Cheddar Goblin tastes the best.</i>

341
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:03,723
<i>That's why Cheddar Goblin
was rated number one</i>

342
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:05,427
<i>three years in a row.</i>

343
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:12,801
<i>Cheddar Goblin by Duvane.
It's gobblin' good.</i>

344
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:15,268
Cheddar Goblin.

345
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,337
<i>This is a test.</i>

<i>This is only a test.</i>

01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,729
Can't you read?

350
01:09:39,573 --> 01:09:41,009
Oh, it's you.

351
01:09:43,478 --> 01:09:45,047
It's been a while.

352
01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:49,585
Come for the Reaper.

353
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:58,627
Perfect condition,
just like you left it.

354
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,635
I'll get out of your hair.

355
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:10,939
So what you going to do
with that thing?

356
01:10:14,108 --> 01:10:15,878
I'm going hunting.

357
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:20,111
If you're gonna go hunting,

358
01:10:20,113 --> 01:10:22,048
I got some other shit
you might need.

359
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:24,883
I was hoping you'd say that.

360
01:10:24,885 --> 01:10:26,020
One to the right.

361
01:10:31,192 --> 01:10:32,859
Made it myself.

362
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,561
It cut through bone
like a fat kid through cake.

363
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:37,230
They're yours
under one condition.

364
01:10:37,232 --> 01:10:38,698
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

365
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,836
You put them to good use.

366
01:10:51,813 --> 01:10:53,114
So what you hunting?

367
01:10:54,248 --> 01:10:55,917
Jesus freaks.

368
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,521
I didn't know they
were in season, man.

369
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,222
Yeah. Well...

370
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:06,462
- Just tell me, man.
- They lit her on fire!

371
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:11,166
They were weirdo hippie types.

372
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,102
Whole bunch of them.

373
01:11:16,136 --> 01:11:19,137
And there was a muscle.
It didn't make any sense.

374
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:23,110
They were bikers
and gnarly psychos and...

375
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:32,254
Crazy evil.

376
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:35,890
Black Skulls.

377
01:11:37,892 --> 01:11:39,595
Black Skulls.

378
01:11:42,697 --> 01:11:44,132
Lookit, man.

379
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:49,235
For a while now, word's been
coming down from the big rigs

380
01:11:49,237 --> 01:11:52,207
something dark
and fearsome out there.

381
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:55,109
No one knows where
they come from.

382
01:11:57,211 --> 01:12:01,012
First, it was stories
from the interstate.

383
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:05,718
Leaving truckers for dead,
prostitutes vanishing,

384
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,954
and gutted bodies on doorsteps.

385
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,559
And always the same.

386
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:15,628
Biker gang, black bikes.

387
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,829
Only seen at night.

388
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:20,134
Weird shit.

389
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:25,036
There's stories that
there was a chapter

390
01:12:25,038 --> 01:12:28,943
than ran courier
for a manufacturer of LSD.

391
01:12:30,144 --> 01:12:36,147
Took a disliking to them and
cooked them up a special batch,

392
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:40,820
and they have never been
right in the head since.

393
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:44,757
I seen them once
from a distance.

394
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:46,892
What you're hunting
is rabid animals,

395
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:52,330
and you should go in knowing
that your odds ain't that good,

396
01:12:52,332 --> 01:12:54,268
and you will probably die.

397
01:12:56,737 --> 01:12:58,172
Don't be negative.

398
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:03,909
Last I heard on the CB,

399
01:13:03,911 --> 01:13:06,348
they were spotted down
near Spirit River.

400
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:16,925
When I seen them things,
they were in a world of pain.

401
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:22,130
But you know what
the freakiest part was?

402
01:13:24,098 --> 01:13:25,801
What's that?

403
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,773
They fucking loved it.

404
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:22,296
Aah!

405
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:53,560
Ah!

406
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:59,533
That was my favorite shirt.

407
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:38,672
Ah!

408
01:19:43,176 --> 01:19:46,714
You have a death wish.

409
01:19:53,453 --> 01:19:57,157
I-I don't want...
I don't want to talk about that.

410
01:20:10,336 --> 01:20:14,508
You're a vicious snowflake.

411
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:54,402
Ah!

412
01:23:15,922 --> 01:23:18,326
Aah!

413
01:23:30,403 --> 01:23:31,936
Aah!

414
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,762
You ripped my shirt!

415
01:23:56,764 --> 01:23:58,763
You ripped my shirt!

416
01:24:05,538 --> 01:24:06,907
Ah!

417
01:26:02,723 --> 01:26:03,658
Ah!

418
01:29:12,712 --> 01:29:17,816
She's still burning.

419
01:29:17,818 --> 01:29:21,022
Aah!

420
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:26,658
She burns.

421
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,192
She burns.

422
01:29:28,194 --> 01:29:30,928
She burns.

423
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:33,365
She burns.

424
01:31:44,497 --> 01:31:46,232
It's cool, man.

425
01:32:00,045 --> 01:32:05,485
Jovan warrior sent forth
from the eye of the storm.

426
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:21,501
Mm.

427
01:32:32,345 --> 01:32:34,215
That's Lizzie.

428
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:38,818
When she's calm,
I know it's good.

429
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,398
You're right.

430
01:32:54,968 --> 01:32:56,470
Oh...

431
01:32:58,304 --> 01:33:00,406
God.
You're right.

432
01:33:25,465 --> 01:33:27,001
Bye, Lizzie.

433
01:33:41,014 --> 01:33:44,151
Oh, man.
They wronged you.

434
01:33:47,386 --> 01:33:49,489
Why they got to be like that?

435
01:33:54,461 --> 01:33:57,198
You exude a cosmic darkness.

436
01:34:02,035 --> 01:34:03,604
Can you see that?

437
01:34:14,113 --> 01:34:15,415
Okay.

438
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:23,924
The children.

439
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:51,085
North.

440
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:28,468
This is really not ideal.

441
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:35,705
You're hurting me!

442
01:38:46,452 --> 01:38:50,824
She... She burned
brightly, Mandy.

443
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:53,227
Don't you think?

444
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:04,569
Still, better to burn out
than fade...

445
01:42:49,828 --> 01:42:50,964
Ah!

446
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:00,814
Jeremiah says...

447
01:47:02,415 --> 01:47:06,182
...I'm the most sensual lover

448
01:47:06,184 --> 01:47:08,988
he's ever experienced...

449
01:47:09,854 --> 01:47:12,759
...because of my sensitivity...

450
01:47:14,859 --> 01:47:16,763
...and my empathy.

451
01:47:20,099 --> 01:47:23,737
I can anticipate
my lover's every move.

452
01:47:27,339 --> 01:47:29,274
I meet them.

453
01:47:31,077 --> 01:47:34,814
Like warm waves...

454
01:47:35,747 --> 01:47:38,115
...licking...

455
01:47:38,117 --> 01:47:40,183
the rocky...

456
01:47:40,185 --> 01:47:43,089
hard shore.

457
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,883
Come no closer.

458
01:48:15,354 --> 01:48:17,323
God is in this room.

459
01:48:25,864 --> 01:48:27,166
Aah!

460
01:48:54,326 --> 01:48:55,862
Oh.

461
01:48:57,062 --> 01:48:58,430
Hi.

462
01:49:00,832 --> 01:49:04,834
You can't harm me, man.

463
01:49:04,836 --> 01:49:09,742
I mean, look at
what he provides.

464
01:49:11,343 --> 01:49:15,281
It's all mine.

465
01:49:18,951 --> 01:49:20,754
You're just meat.

466
01:49:21,519 --> 01:49:23,822
Without a soul.

467
01:49:24,523 --> 01:49:26,824
Without a brain.

468
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:28,862
Without anything.

469
01:49:29,894 --> 01:49:31,160
Animal.

470
01:49:31,162 --> 01:49:33,030
You...

471
01:49:33,032 --> 01:49:37,467
You have no spirit everlasting.

472
01:49:37,469 --> 01:49:38,502
No...

473
01:49:38,504 --> 01:49:41,474
No radiant light.

474
01:49:42,474 --> 01:49:49,015
I possess hallucinations
you will never know.

475
01:49:52,518 --> 01:49:55,020
The psychotic drones.

476
01:49:56,255 --> 01:49:58,458
Where the mystic swims.

477
01:49:59,591 --> 01:50:01,260
You're drowning.

478
01:50:03,261 --> 01:50:05,262
I'm swimming.

479
01:50:05,264 --> 01:50:11,535
You unholy abomination.

480
01:50:11,537 --> 01:50:15,141
You aren't even worth my spit.

481
01:50:18,443 --> 01:50:22,948
It's all that hate
in your heart.

482
01:50:24,082 --> 01:50:25,818
That's to blame.

483
01:50:27,219 --> 01:50:30,089
Follows you everywhere, man.

484
01:50:31,223 --> 01:50:35,525
Follows you everywhere.

485
01:50:35,527 --> 01:50:37,497
I can still help you.

486
01:50:39,331 --> 01:50:43,333
It's not just your life
I can save, no.

487
01:50:43,335 --> 01:50:45,369
It's your goddamn soul.

488
01:50:45,371 --> 01:50:47,271
No, no, no, no!
Please, please.

489
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:48,271
Please don't hurt me!

490
01:50:48,273 --> 01:50:49,673
Shh!

491
01:50:49,675 --> 01:50:53,043
Can't you see this was
all part of your journey,

492
01:50:53,045 --> 01:50:56,181
the journey that led you to me?

493
01:50:57,181 --> 01:50:59,316
To your salvation.

494
01:50:59,318 --> 01:51:02,589
To your cleansing by my hand.

495
01:51:07,292 --> 01:51:09,459
I'll blow you, man.

496
01:51:09,461 --> 01:51:13,233
I'll suck your fucking dick!

497
01:51:14,465 --> 01:51:16,133
Is that what you want?

498
01:51:16,135 --> 01:51:19,302
Oh, please, please, please!

499
01:51:19,304 --> 01:51:21,373
Please don't do it.

500
01:51:26,612 --> 01:51:31,216
No, no!

501
01:51:33,018 --> 01:51:35,953
I don't kneel before you!

502
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:39,222
<i>You</i> kneel before <i>me!</i>

503
01:51:39,224 --> 01:51:44,360
I carry God's gift
in my heart, not you,

504
01:51:44,362 --> 01:51:49,368
so you kneel before me,
motherfucker!

505
01:51:51,036 --> 01:51:56,405
I'm your god now.

506
01:52:08,453 --> 01:52:10,657
Aah!
