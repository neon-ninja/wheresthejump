1
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,760
Behind me is Brabourne School,

2
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,840
where news is just in that the missing
teenagers have been found after 18 days.

3
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,840
Now the waiting is finally over.

4
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,640
The four teenagers
attend Brabourne School,

5
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,960
where fees are in excess
of $30,000 a year.

6
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,440
Unconfirmed reports say
they have been taken to a local hospital,

7
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,714
where their families
have been anxiously waiting.

8
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,204
Michael Steel, son of rock guitarist
Stevie Steel, was one of the missing.

9
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,800
Liz.

10
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,080
–Liz!
–See you inside.

11
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,200
He's going to kill us!

12
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,200
–No!
–Liz…

13
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,480
–No! Stop!

14
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Hi. I'm Dr Horwood.
I'm here to help you.

15
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
Thanks.

16
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,920
Don't put me on Prozac or lithium.
I'm not crazy.

17
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,800
It's just my mum, she won't listen.

18
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,400
I'll listen.

19
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,360
Do I have to talk about it today?

20
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,280
You make it sound so terrible.

21
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,880
If you trust me and you work with me,

22
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,200
I really think I can help you feel better.

23
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,880
So we do this at your speed, yeah?
We can stop at any time.

24
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,280
I won't lie to you:
this is going to be difficult,

25
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,320
but I know that you're brave enough
to get through it.

26
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,200
Let's try a breathing exercise.

27
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,760
It might seem really… stupid,
but let's just give it a bash, OK?

28
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,800
Take a nice deep breath.

29
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,160
Feel your lungs fill up with air.
Good. Drop your shoulders.

30
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,040
And when you exhale,
tell all the muscles in your body to relax.

31
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,760
And whenever you feel ready,
just start to speak. OK?

32
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,160
This is how it works at Brabourne.

33
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,930
If you want to exist, you have
to be pretty. You have to be thin.

34
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
Everyone else is wallpaper.

35
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,760
For years I was a nobody.

36
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,880
I watched the world from the edges
and learned not to dream.

37
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,440
–Oh, is he?

38
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,120
My best friend, Martin, didn't care.

39
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,040
His philosophy was:
“Take everything you can from them”.

40
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,560
He said that their greed makes them
easy to control. It made him powerful.

41
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,640
But then the world changed.

42
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,080
Get ready, girls.
Mike Steel is single again.

43
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
Oh, my God!

44
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
Mike Steel. American.
The son of a rock star.

45
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,640
The missing part of my soul.

46
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,560
–Get up!

47
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,880
Please get up.

48
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,240
Please, please be OK. Get up.

49
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,760
Sorry, mate. I see why this lot
need to wear body armour.

50
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
It's a homoerotic thing.

51
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,360
All that aggression out here,

52
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,920
then all that steam and soap
in the showers.

53
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,640
That's disgusting.

54
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,000
–Right, you two! Off!

55
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,480
Maybe Geoff will be Mike's new bride.

56
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,600
For your information, Martin,
he's dating a supermodel called Amber.

57
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,440
For yours, he's not.

58
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,658
–You lie.
–Don't you live here?

59
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,400
Haven't you noticed that suddenly
everyone's a blonde with cherry lip gloss?

60
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,360
There's been an invasion of Amber clones.
It's passed you by, thank God.

61
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,568
You're the last woman with a brain
in Brabourne.

62
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,080
–He's single?
–Half a brain. Yes.

63
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,080
Oh, not you, too, Liz.
Please don't lose it.

64
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,440
I didn't know.

65
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,560
But he's just a guy like me. You wouldn't
think he was so perfect if you knew him.

66
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,800
He shits and farts like the rest of us.
He's just a fuck of a lot less interesting!

67
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,640
I can't help it. It's an egg thing.

68
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
When I look at Mike,
I see the face of an angel…

69
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
and the soul of a poet. I need him.

70
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,240
No, no, no. No, you love me.
It's a Martin Taylor fact.

71
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,702
Has there been a day in the last five years
that we haven't talked?

72
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,240
But you're more like a gay friend
than a boyfriend.

73
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,640
–But I'm not gay!
–Yeah, right

74
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,120
It's the end of term,
I've got some grateful exes to call…

75
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,440
and most importantly, I am out of here.

76
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Hello There is the small matter
of the geography field trip.

77
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,760
Mm. Bentley, school gates, Friday.
Off to LA. Bye! Nice time.

78
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,240
Oh, you are such a jockey.
Stevie will have a shitfit if you don't go.

79
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,560
You think I'm gonna tell him? I'm gonna
lie low in a hotel. He'll never know.

80
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,800
My arse. Tabloids are gagging for you.

81
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,080
You are having a wet weekend in Wales…

82
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,960
with no hot water, fish paste sandwiches
and ten-mile tabs, like it or not.

83
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,200
Hm. That's awful dark, Geoffrey.

84
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,360
Shit, I don't want to go either.

85
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,400
We have to ditch. I'm serious.
This could kill me.

86
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
Frankie's not going. She saw wellies
on the kit list and nearly had a seizure.

87
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,720
–How'd she get out of it?
–Well, she saw Martin Taylor.

88
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,560
You know what I want
Show me the money

89
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,720
Frankie?

90
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,520
Frankie?

91
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
I need to talk to you.

92
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,000
Come.

93
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,720
What's she done this time?

94
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,960
My hair. It's all gone wrong.

95
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,840
I've messed up.

96
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,040
Let me see.

97
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,080
–What, did your mobile give you a tumour?

98
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,960
Do you mind? My coursework
doesn't write itself, you know.

99
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,788
–What is it?
–Intensive conditioner.

100
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,360
It should have you sorted in 20 minutes.

101
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,480
–What did you use?
–Peroxide.

102
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,960
–Where from?
–The lab.

103
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,160
Oh, Lizzie.

104
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,960
I just thought if I was a blonde
like Amber, then…

105
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,560
I don't mean to be rude,
but I don't think doing stuff to yourself…

106
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,400
will make any difference to Mike.

107
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,720
No, I know.

108
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,760
Oh, don't worry about it.
Trust me, he's not that wonderful.

109
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,840
Frankie?

110
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,040
Thanks.

111
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,000
I know you don't have to be nice to me.

112
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,480
Don't worry about it.

113
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,880
My life has no meaning.

114
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,160
Come in, sit down.
Make yourself at home.

115
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
I love him and he doesn't
even know I exist.

116
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,440
I hate seeing you like this.

117
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,120
Hey, I can cheer you up.
I've got chocolate.

118
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,520
Martin, you don't understand.
You've never been in love.

119
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,160
You've never had the pain.

120
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,800
God, I feel like I'm dying.

121
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,160
I can help you.

122
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,520
–Really?
–Really.

123
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,760
Welcome to my office.

124
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,120
Now, this is a need-to-know operation.

125
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,840
–Can you do it or not?
–No field trip,

126
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,120
no parents, no paparazzi?
I can do anything.

127
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,560
And, er…

128
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm adding one to your number.

129
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,200
A kindred spirit.

130
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,720
Martin knew that the school and
our parents always believed each other.

131
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,400
He called it the unholy alliance.

132
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,160
If our parents thought we were in Wales
and the school thought we were at home,

133
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,160
they'd never question it.

134
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,240
Baby

135
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,600
See me

136
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,880
Call, baby

137
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
You seem cold, oh

138
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,960
I fall

139
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,360
–In love
–Bye!

140
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,800
Come, please

141
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,840
Hold me
Goodbye

142
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,880
Aye, aye, here come the troops.

143
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,920
Jesus, you're late!
Did anyone see you?

144
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,640
Just back from the Himalayas.

145
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,720
Liz. Frankie you know,
Geoff I'm sure you've heard of.

146
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,600
–None of it is true.
–Except that one about the butter.

147
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,000
And Mike.

148
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,280
Well, call me a muppet, mate,
but there's nothing here.

149
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,960
I'm not spending all weekend
sitting on a tree trunk.

150
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,360
–You can't see the wood for the trees.
–Is he taking the piss?

151
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,040
Are you taking the piss, Martin?
I could snap your neck like that, mate.

152
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,440
It's right here. Can't you see it?

153
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,960
You have ten seconds to get interesting.

154
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,280
It's right beneath your feet.

155
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,640
–Oh, yes.
–Oh, no.

156
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,480
Oh, yes! Martin!

157
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,160
Watch out, ladies.

158
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,238
Whoa, dude! Whoa! You all right?
Hey, I'm coming down. Hang on.

159
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,200
Oh, my God, how cool.

160
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
–Hello!

161
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
–Yeeehaaa! Whooo! Oh, man.
–Shit, how deep is it?

162
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,440
–Oh, my God.
–Look at this fucking thing.

163
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,480
–Man, where'd you get the key?
–Wouldn't you like to know?

164
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,120
–And what is this?
–You know the old war bunker over there?

165
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,960
This is the escape hatch.

166
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,760
You're so weird, dude.

167
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,240
Will you have to close it?

168
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
I need fresh air to keep my skin clear.

169
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,680
–Oh, right. It looks beautiful.
–Stop it.

170
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,640
–You don't want to be found, do you?
–No, we certainly don't.

171
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,040
Nice one. See you later.

172
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,720
–You're going in there?
–Course I'm going in there!

173
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,920
See you inside.

174
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,244
–The power's on the left.
–Yeah.

175
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,520
Oh, man. What is that smell?

176
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,440
It looks like a tomb.

177
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,200
–And?
–And I ain't goin' in there.

178
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Oh, like I care what you think?

179
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,520
Uh…

180
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,320
Can't be any worse than Wales, right?

181
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,600
–Me next!
–That's practical, Frankie

182
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
–Did you get that smell? What is that?
–Jesus, man.

183
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,640
–You all right?
–What?

184
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,680
You all right? Watch out for that bit.

185
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,120
Oh, man.

186
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,120
Mikey, look at this, man.
Check this out! This is huge!

187
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,640
Look at that! What is that stuff?

188
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,040
Whoa!

189
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,800
Ladies, you are going to love it down here!

190
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,960
I'll get them to send it up
to your room, Frankie!

191
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,840
–Oh, shut up! Just be careful with it.
–This way.

192
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
–Jesus, it's so dark!
–Right, I'm going first.

193
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,880
–Are you going down?
–Yeah.

194
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,640
–The ladder stops, mate.
–What?

195
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,800
Oh, no, it's cool. It's just…

196
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,720
Do you need a light?

197
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,760
–Yeah. Shine it down here.
–What is that smell? It's disgusting!

198
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,160
Enjoy the Mike Steel experience.

199
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,120
Do you think he'll fall in love with me?

200
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,800
Just be careful.

201
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,280
–Liz, watch the step.
–Mate, look at the pit!

202
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,080
Here, pass the rucksack.
Mind the ledge, it's really narrow.

203
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,000
–You guys all right?
–Yeah, we're cool, cheers.

204
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,240
–Close the door!
–Bye-bye, Martin! Bye-bye!

205
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,960
–Put the lights on!

206
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,200
–Frankie, calm down!
–Can you put the lights on?

207
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,840
I don't like it! Oh, God,
can't you find the light switch?

208
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,320
Calm down!

209
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,480
–Yeeeehaaa!
–Whoooo!

210
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,560
–Would you look at this?
–Lights!

211
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,920
What do you think, girls?
Pretty damn good!

212
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,560
–Aaaaaaaaaah!

213
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,480
I shot you in the back like
six times, dude! You're dead!

214
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,480
We love you

215
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
Got no brakes
but you know we got a radio

216
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,040
You're in the way!

217
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,520
You've gotta move
when we're rockin' on your stereo

218
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,600
Die, scum! Get out of the way!

219
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,800
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way of the woman!

220
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,240
–Get out of the way of the lady!

221
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,564
–You're dead!
–You're gonna die!

222
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,240
–No, man!
–You're the only one to die!

223
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,400
We love…

224
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,160
Love
We love you

225
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,800
Love
We love you

226
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,000
Love
We love you…

227
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,320
Would you mind if I boiled
water for my pasta?

228
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,960
No, not at all. D'you want to go first?

229
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Yeah. Sure. Cheers, I'll…

230
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,338
It's great stuff. It's got this hole
down the middle so it cooks quickly.

231
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,560
Have you got a pan I can borrow?

232
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,840
–There you go.
–Cheers.

233
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,040
–What are you having on that?
–Er… nothing.

234
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,400
You can't have pasta and nothing.

235
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,560
–That's nice. That's really nice.
–I've got salt. Do you want some?

236
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,480
Pasta and salt? No! Thanks, though.

237
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,400
–What are you having, then?
–I'm not hungry.

238
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,960
–You've got to have something.
–Didn't really bring anything.

239
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,280
–You didn't bring any food?
–Not food food. A bit of gum.

240
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,840
How will you survive on gum
for three days?

241
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,760
It slipped my mind.
It didn't occur to me.

242
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,920
–OK, so food slipped your mind.
–I've got food.

243
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,280
I've got sausages and beans and noodles.

244
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,760
Plenty for everyone.
You can have as much as you want.

245
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,760
You have sausages?

246
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,080
Do you have tomato sauce?

247
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,840
–Some.
–You enjoy your pasta, OK?

248
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,320
I'm having sausages…

249
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,240
with Liz… tonight.

250
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,360
Frankie?

251
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,760
No… no, thanks. I'm on a diet. I've got
fibre pills to stop me feeling hungry.

252
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,640
Yum

253
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,360
OK, it's my turn.

254
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,920
My friend was driving his girlfriend
in his Ferrari…

255
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,160
Who do you know with a Ferrari?

256
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,160
Bob and Sally. You don't know them.

257
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,760
Bob and who?

258
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,880
–Mike, don't!
–Fuck off. Really, relax.

259
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,920
Bob and Sally went for a drive, but they
ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere.

260
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,400
So Bob went to find some. Sally was left
in the car. She switched on the radio…

261
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,598
and they said there was like
this crazy madman on the loose.

262
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,160
–But she was really tired…
–Man with a hook.

263
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,160
–On the roof of the car.
–With Bob's head on a stick.

264
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
–On a hook!
–No, this really happened!

265
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Frankie

266
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,280
OK, I've got one for you.
Make you cack your pants.

267
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,680
–What⁈
–Shut up, man.

268
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,800
Something happens to Martin.
Doesn't come back for us.

269
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,440
Told you.

270
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
That's sick.

271
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,280
Possible.

272
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
Don't be stupid.

273
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,280
Geoff, you shouldn't say that.
What if you make it happen?

274
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,200
How can I make anything happen
when I'm here with you?

275
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,200
–You'll jinx us.
–How?

276
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,880
–It's tempting fate!
–Oh, please how does that work?

277
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,458
–Lizzie?
–I'm a scientist. I don't believe in fate.

278
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,560
–Mike?
–I'm a Scientologist. I'm with Liz.

279
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,640
–Oh, yes!
–Fine!

280
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,240
But if anything happens to Martin,
it's Geoff's fault, OK?

281
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,120
If that's what it takes to get you
to shut up about it, fine.

282
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,600
–Fine. Fine.
–Is my story the best, or what?

283
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,840
–Ole, ole ole ole!
–Liz.

284
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,530
–Bingham, Bingham.
–Liz.

285
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,560
–What happened on the third day?
–Don't you want to know what we did?

286
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,040
Martin was supposed to let you out,
wasn't he? Liz?

287
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,120
–Liz.
–I don't know!

288
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,560
–What don't you know?
–I don't know what happened.

289
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,720
Come on, you're quite safe here.
Deep breaths. Look at me.

290
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,060
It's the third day.
You're packed and ready to go.

291
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,680
What's the time now?

292
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,800
Same as when you asked
two minutes ago.

293
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
Well, it can't be the same time
if two minutes have passed, can it?

294
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,600
It's 3.32, then.

295
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,102
So where is he? The field trip's
supposed to be back in 30 minutes.

296
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,720
I have a driver waiting. This is so…

297
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,240
What if he's been hit by a bus, is in a coma
and can't tell anyone where we are?

298
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,880
–Oh, please.
–Oh, my God. What if he's dead?

299
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,200
He's not dead!

300
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,640
I'll call him. What's his number?

301
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,680
–They don't work down here!
–Here, give me your phone. Let me try.

302
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,720
You get anything?

303
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,600
No, nothing.

304
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,080
Maybe give it a shot up by the door.

305
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,200
–Does it work?
–No, nothing.

306
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,360
–You've jinxed us. I knew you would.
–This is a wind-up.

307
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
No, this is your fault! You never
should have said those things!

308
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,360
Hey! You guys! Have you thought
that maybe the traffic's heavy?

309
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,480
It's cool, I'm not worried.

310
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,000
Help! Help!

311
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,200
–Geoff! Open the door!
–Everyone just calm…

312
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,720
–He's just trying to help!
–What do you think I'm trying to do?

313
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,920
Please! Shut up and let me get on with it!

314
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,400
–You're stinking mad.
–Hey! Hey.

315
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,338
–We're nowhere closer!
–Hit it with the pipe, then.

316
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,480
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you have a go, darling? Go on!

317
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,400
OK, so they know
we never went to Wales.

318
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,760
As far as they know,
we have a three-day head start,

319
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,486
which means they could be covering
a three-day radius of the school.

320
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,640
That covers…

321
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,720
like, the whole world.

322
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
So what do we do?

323
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,400
We're being held to ransom until
Martin says so. We can't do anything.

324
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,160
Don't say that! I mean,
he could just be ill.

325
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,160
Isn't that right, Lizzie?

326
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,040
I don't know.

327
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,040
Why would he do this? We're his friends!

328
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,640
Are we?

329
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,840
Is he really your friend, Frankie?
He's not mine.

330
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,982
Think about it.
I don't know a thing about him.

331
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,560
He has no morals, no ethics.
Everything's just a game to him.

332
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,160
Oh, so this is a game? Oh, that's great!

333
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,480
That's fucking wonderful
Oh, my God, I paid for this.

334
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,720
Yeah, but he's careful.

335
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,040
Nothing's left to chance.

336
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,240
Right now, we're trapped
because he wants us trapped.

337
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,640
Why?

338
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,080
Well, I guess we're gonna find out.

339
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,400
Liz. Look at me.

340
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,320
He didn't come back.

341
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,120
Martin didn't come back.

342
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,880
You've cracked it! I knew you would.

343
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,160
I told the lads.
This fucking great cheer went up.

344
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,720
A bloody schoolboy, I said.
Little Lord bloody Fauntleroy!

345
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,400
–Good job, Doctor.
–Thanks, Detective.

346
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,760
The hunt for the kidnapper
of the Brabourne teenagers…

347
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,840
took an unexpected turn today,

348
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,200
as it was announced that police
have arrested a pupil from the school.

349
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,680
The boy, who cannot be named
for legal reasons,

350
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,040
was located in the Dominican Republic,

351
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,840
where it is believed
he was on holiday with his family.

352
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,360
I've put together a rough character sketch
based on the information we have.

353
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,080
Locking the children in
suggests a sociopathic personality.

354
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,400
He doesn't think what he's done is wrong.
He probably thinks he's above the law.

355
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,480
Right now he's probably creating
a very strong alibi.

356
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,560
So the longer he has to conjure up
this fiction, the harder it'll be to crack.

357
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,098
If you want a confession,
you'll have to act quickly.

358
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,400
So,

359
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,720
when the police arrest Martin,
will they put him in a cell?

360
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,560
I presume so.

361
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,840
Good. I hope they do.

362
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,680
Let's see how he likes it.

363
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,120
–All right, let's start.
–Er… hang on.

364
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,720
–OK, I'm ready.

365
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,800
–Can we talk?
–Sure. Shall I come over there?

366
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,920
OK.

367
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,840
Can I get in?

368
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,600
What's up? Can't sleep?

369
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,640
It… it's about Martin.

370
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,760
I think he's watching us.

371
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,360
I saw… a shadow pass the slat.
It could be nothing, I… I could be wrong…

372
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,776
but I think it might have been him
checking up on us.

373
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,720
It probably is him.

374
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,520
It's so funny.

375
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,360
Y'know, Stevie sent me here
to protect me from the nut jobs at home.

376
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,080
I think I know what Martin's doing.

377
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,720
Go on.

378
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,280
Martin wants me to see that…

379
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,240
it was stupid of me to like you
when I don't even know you.

380
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,920
He wants me to hate you.

381
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,560
We're still down here because
he was wrong. He hates being wrong,

382
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,504
so we're stuck down here till he's right.

383
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,400
Hold on. You knew this would happen
even before we came down here?

384
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,040
No, of course not.

385
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,450
But it's the only explanation
I can think of.

386
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,600
But what difference does it make?

387
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,560
He likes you, doesn't he?

388
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,720
Yeah. Since we were eleven.

389
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,920
One of those.

390
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,160
Yeah.

391
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,280
But you…

392
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,240
like me?

393
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,920
Yeah.

394
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,800
Sorry.

395
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,320
Don't worry about it.

396
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,320
But… how does he know
you don't hate me?

397
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,080
I mean… I don't…

398
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,680
How could he work that out
from a split second at the door?

399
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,560
I don't know.

400
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,520
What is it?

401
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,480
What?

402
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,802
–Is that what I think it is?
–Yeah.

403
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,360
Are there more?

404
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,080
Whoa.

405
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,920
Try that one over there.

406
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,360
–Which one?
–This one.

407
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,000
–He's covered the whole place.

408
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,920
–Jesus Christ!

409
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,778
–What's going on? What is it?
–Liz, it's the middle of the night! What?

410
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,040
I'm really worried about her.
She needs a doctor.

411
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,520
That's obvious I thought
you were supposed to be smart.

412
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,200
I bet it's that dirty toilet water
that's making her ill.

413
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,000
–It's not my fault!
–Yes, it is!

414
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,320
–This is shit!

415
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,880
This is the worst time I've ever had!
I hope I never see you again.

416
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,560
–It's not that bad!
–No! Things are very bad!

417
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,966
I mean, am I the only one
who can smell the toilet?

418
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,538
Who left the monster log
that we can't fucking flush?

419
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,516
We're fucked, and
it's all your fucking fault!

420
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,120
Why me?

421
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,320
–Because he's your best friend!
–Yeah!

422
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,240
I should've never came down here.
As soon as I saw you,

423
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,320
you fucking geeky little fucking bitch,

424
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,304
I should've turned the other fucking way!

425
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,840
Just stay the fuck away from me,
you fucking loser!

426
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,600
You're not so great yourself, you know.
You're full of shit!

427
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,920
What are you, anyway?
You're just a face… and hair!

428
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,160
Oh, shut up, you…

429
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,400
fuckin'…

430
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,640
comebag!

431
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
We waited and waited,
and nothing happened.

432
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,640
–But it worked.

433
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,000
The next morning Mike woke me up
and the door was open.

434
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,960
We were so happy.

435
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,960
We were out.

436
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,240
We all grabbed each other
and just stood in the light.

437
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,440
It was over. We'd beaten him.

438
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,280
We'd won.

439
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,960
What Martin didn't realise
was that I'd even won Mike.

440
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,440
We ran up as quickly as we could.

441
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,176
Mike gave me a great big hug
and he said “You saved us”.

442
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,040
–“You saved us all”.
–You saved us all.

443
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,320
Here we are.

444
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,600
Right.

445
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,040
Well done. I told you you'd get through it.
How do you feel?

446
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,200
Lighter.

447
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,570
Last night I even closed the door
all the way and I didn't panic.

448
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,320
Excellent. You've made a lot of progress.

449
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,520
–We've still got a lot of work to do.
–Oh?

450
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Yeah, but you'll get there.
It's… it's really good.

451
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,920
I'll see you later.

452
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,200
OK? Bye.

453
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,480
Bye.

454
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Yeah, Tom here.

455
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,530
–Tom, it's Philippa.
–What can I do for you?

456
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,240
Listen, she thinks she spent the last week
in fucking Disneyland!

457
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
–Oh, yeah?
–I'm sorry. I didn't see it coming.

458
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,720
Doesn't matter, I'll get a confession
out of Martin, no problem.

459
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,120
I mean, how delusional can she be?

460
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,880
So I suppose you've got fingerprints?

461
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,480
DNA?

462
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,480
CCTV footage of me creeping around
or a stack of witnesses with 20/20

463
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,840
Do you even have a motive?

464
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200
A bloody good reason why I should
lock up a bunch of socialites…

465
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,680
and throw away the key,
however tempting that might be?

466
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,640
–What did you do on the last day of term?
–Is she deaf?

467
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,224
Is she thick? I mean, can they really keep
asking the same question hour after hour?

468
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,400
Please. Just so we're clear.

469
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,400
I got up at 7am as usual.

470
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,200
I cleaned my teeth and had a shit.

471
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,760
I was down at breakfast by 7.20am,
as usual.

472
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,080
The matron ticked me off the list,

473
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,520
I had two slices of cold toast with
warm butter and sweet tea as usual.

474
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,800
I returned to my study and carried my bags
to the school minibus at 8am…

475
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,280
and was sat on the minibus by 8.05.

476
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,040
I sat beside the driver
because I wanted to sit on my own.

477
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,080
We left for the station at 8.30am
and arrived at a not unreasonable 8.45am.

478
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,240
I bought a Telegraph and a Kit Kat…

479
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,320
and then caught my train
promptly at 9.05 from platform two.

480
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,720
I was alone until Charing Cross,
where I was met by my mother,

481
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,080
who parked the car in the wrong area
and got a ticket as usual.

482
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,840
Martin. We know why you did it,
how you did it, the whole fucking lot.

483
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,840
Elizabeth has told us everything. Hey?

484
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,320
Well, I knew she was fucked in the head,
but I didn't realise she was this vicious.

485
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,584
Well, you… you know Liz hates me.
You do know that, don't you?

486
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,478
Thanks for taking me home.
I can't wait to get into my own bed.

487
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,040
You'll feel better
once you get back into your old routine.

488
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,520
Now, if you need anything, day or night,
just call me, all right?

489
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,160
You can go back any time you want.

490
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,214
I have to get back to the real world.
You said so yourself.

491
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,760
You really don't know anything, do you?

492
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,694
Liz and Frankie are best friends!
They're thick as thieves!

493
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,880
You're sure?

494
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,174
They're practically the same person!
Boring, vain, shallow enough to paddle in.

495
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,440
But Liz is the really nasty one.

496
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,480
Do you have a pen?

497
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,800
This is how it is at Brabourne.

498
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,080
To exist, you either have to be
a bitch or a complete slut.

499
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,120
What is it?

500
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,840
Amber dumped Mike half an hour ago.

501
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,800
Oh, fuck.

502
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,320
–Come on.

503
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,600
It's the big chance
you've been waiting for!

504
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,240
Oh, my God, I'm going to be sick.

505
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,758
Move quick, girl, or you'll be auditioning
with every peekaboo slut from London up.

506
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,960
I don't just want him.

507
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,320
I really want him, Frankie.

508
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,240
–I've got a plan.
–Let's hear it.

509
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,360
We go to the beach again like last year.
But this time we camp out.

510
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,000
It'll be perfect. The sea air, the stars…

511
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,360
I hate beaches. All that sand up your crack
and nowhere to pee apart from the ocean.

512
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,120
And it dries out the complexion.

513
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,880
I'll look 40 after ten minutes
and you want me to go for a week?

514
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,000
Remember that place we found
and said it'd be great for a party?

515
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,000
The S&M dungeon
Martin tried to take you to?

516
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,726
Precisely. What if we did that?

517
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,280
I could get Mike pretty much on his own
for a few days…

518
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,440
and we could even ask Geoff… for you.

519
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,200
–The four of us?
–Yeah.

520
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,400
A private party, the end of term.
Me, you, Mike and Geoff.

521
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,440
Oi, oi, Frankie!

522
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,830
up his arse
with a rampant penis

523
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,760
Wahey!

524
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,160
–Dangerous place for a lady.

525
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,360
–If you say so.
–Whooo!

526
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,120
–Out. Neil, out! She's not here for you.
–See you, Geoff.

527
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,000
Couldn't have come at a better time.
I'm ready if you are.

528
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,480
How would you like to go
to the best private party of your life?

529
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,698
–Are you going?
–It's my party.

530
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,000
–How private?
–You, me,

531
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,120
Mike and Liz.

532
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,640
–Mike never mentioned it.
–That's cos you're inviting him.

533
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,120
–I don't know if I could do that.
–It's for three days.

534
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,760
Absolutely extracurricular.

535
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,880
Your parents don't know
and the school doesn't know.

536
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,840
What we do would be our own business.

537
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,600
But if you're too pussy,
then I'll ask someone else.

538
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,808
–I never said I wasn't interested.
–In or out?

539
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,360
–In.
–But you have to bring Mike.

540
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,740
I'll have a word with His Highness.
Anything else?

541
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,560
Put your knob away.

542
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,600
Go.

543
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,120
–Did you do it?
–Yeah. Done.

544
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,360
It will be great.

545
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,840
Oh, please

546
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,120
Man, I'm telling you, this is different.
This is ten out of ten.

547
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,960
Frankie and Liz. Real ten out of ten

548
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,080
So you're going home to an empty house
and fuck the maid again?

549
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,080
You haven't seen the maid.

550
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,000
Plus…

551
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,680
Amber won't know where you are.

552
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,680
Won't be able to find you.

553
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,960
She'll assume you're having a more
exciting time with more famous people.

554
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,360
It'll drive her nuts.

555
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,880
All right. I'm in.

556
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,920
When you're convinced
of your superiority,

557
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,960
you don't need help
from mere mortals like me.

558
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,440
You can fuck things up all by yourself.
So there you have it.

559
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,242
–I thank you.
–What time did you lock them in the hole?

560
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,640
Because I know you did it.

561
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,760
How dare you be this wrong
and this fucking pig-headed!

562
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,720
How dare you put my mother through this!
How do you know it was me?

563
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm dying to know! Come on!

564
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,280
One of them is lying.
I have to talk to her.

565
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,200
–She can tell me what I need to know.
–I understand.

566
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,520
But if you start demanding things,

567
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,200
she could go back
to that stony silence bullshit.

568
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,200
That's a risk I have to take. I've nothing
on Martin. In 12 hours, he walks.

569
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,440
Tom, if you say one word to her,
I will fucking kill you!

570
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,280
Just let me go. I'll get the answers.

571
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,840
He's going to get away with it, isn't he?

572
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,720
No. You mustn't think like that.

573
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Did he ever keep a diary or journal,
or anything like that?

574
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,720
I don't think so.

575
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,800
Did he have a secret hiding place?

576
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,000
No, I don't know.

577
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,800
Why?

578
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,720
What's wrong?

579
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,706
You're not going to let him out, are you?

580
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,720
I'm afraid that's not my decision.

581
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,800
–He's going to come after me!
–He won't, Liz. You're perfectly safe.

582
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,920
–Is he out now?
–No, but he will be in a couple of hours.

583
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,480
–Hours⁈
–That's why I really need you to remember.

584
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,720
–You said I'd be safe.
–You are safe.

585
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,720
I trusted you! I thought we were friends!
I told you everything!

586
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,520
You've been pretending the whole time
because you're paid to!

587
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,160
–That's not true.
–Leave me alone!

588
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,680
–I can help you.

589
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,960
Nice one.

590
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,680
You don't want to be found, do you?

591
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,360
–Sweeties!

592
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,760
Geoff, pass it up! Give it here!

593
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,760
–You want it, you got it, baby!

594
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,388
We're watching you

595
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,840
Hi.

596
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,960
So… who do you want first?

597
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,960
What are you talking about,
Mikey? I'm dancing.

598
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,840
Wrong approach, mate.
Frankie, I've got something for you.

599
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,720
–Oh, fuck off, Geoffrey!

600
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,928
–Stop being such a fucking tourist.
–I am not.

601
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,040
–Jesus.
–Is there sex or not?

602
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,680
Not. And especially not with you.

603
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,360
And especially not in here.
Have you seen how dirty it is?

604
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,040
Yeah, I have.

605
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,212
And why would there be sex?
I mean, what have you done for me?

606
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,120
No, I don't think so.

607
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,360
Sorry.

608
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,000
Look, Frankie, y'know,
we've had a lot of anticipation.

609
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,560
And it's medically proven that teasing
can ruin a young man's nuts.

610
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,640
Fuck off, I've heard this all before!

611
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,880
So you have to.

612
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,640
Oh, shit!

613
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,520
Hello!

614
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,800
Are you all right?

615
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,160
I need some more!

616
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm goin' first!

617
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,040
–Come on, get it off. Come on!

618
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,680
Ooh, careful! It's expensive!

619
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,080
Now I've wanted to see this
for the last four years.

620
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,640
Frankie.

621
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,240
I've had this. It's OK.

622
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,400
What, seven? Eight out of ten?

623
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,160
–Mm… four.
–Oh, thank you

624
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,720
–Frankie!
–We were, what, 13?

625
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,960
I mean, it was a one-night stand.
It wasn't exactly memorable.

626
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,120
It was a long time ago
and I'm a lot better now.

627
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,800
–But you liked it.
–Uh-huh.

628
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,840
Ow! What the fuck is wrong with you?

629
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,560
–You fuckin' nut job!

630
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,000
Yes, oh, yes! Lizzie!

631
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,120
Thank you!

632
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,520
How does it go?

633
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,880
That's it, no more free feels.

634
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,280
You must be joking.
What am I meant to do with the old man?

635
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,080
–Suck it off, big boy.

636
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,280
–Whoa! Ten out of ten! Ten out of ten.
–What? What did she do?

637
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,200
–Oh, go on, give us a look, Franks.

638
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,680
–What did she do?
–Nothing.

639
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,360
–Oh, come on, do it again!
–Forget it, it's supposed to be a party.

640
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,600
It's a shit party,
but it's a party nonetheless.

641
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,440
You always get to see everything.

642
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,200
Why's it always you?
I never get to see the good bits.

643
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,640
–Can't we have the light on?
–No! I can't sleep if it's light.

644
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,960
–Well, it's too dark to sleep!
–How can it be? Shut your eyes.

645
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,040
Well, I can't tell when my eyes are open
or closed, it's so fucking dark!

646
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,120
–Oh, shit!
–Shh!

647
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,800
–It's only me.

648
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,120
–Never fear, Geoff's here.
–What?

649
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,080
–Can we get some sleep, please!
–Will you shut up!

650
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,480
What are you doing?

651
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,680
Mm…

652
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,960
Turn the light off.

653
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,440
She must have spent days
picking the lock, but she did it.

654
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,120
She beat him and I'll beat him too.
Little shit of a schoolboy.

655
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,240
His website, “Disciples of Chaos,”…

656
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,840
is anarchist bullshit about disrupting
stock exchanges, air traffic control,

657
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,760
the Web itself.

658
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,120
I'm gonna nail him.

659
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,960
I don't think he's angry enough
to have done it.

660
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,440
Hi.

661
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,400
–Thanks for meeting me.
–No problem. Shall we go straight there?

662
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,560
–Sure.
–It's not far, it's just up the hill.

663
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,640
–I'm not great with small spaces.
–Neither am I. I can't stand them.

664
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,102
But that will be the least of your worries
when you get down there.

665
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,040
–What were they doing here?
–Trying to have a good time.

666
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,120
They had plenty of booze,
they'd wired up some party lights.

667
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,360
The prime suspect
has been released without charge.

668
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,200
The police have yet to make
any formal statement…

669
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,360
and it is understood that investigations
are proceeding satisfactorily.

670
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,634
The families have requested
that the press res…

671
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,760
God.

672
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,338
You can't go! The trip doesn't
get back for two days!

673
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,240
–Mate, you said you'd do this.
–Fuck the trip.

674
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,400
OK, yeah, fuck things up
for the rest of us.

675
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,160
–Do something! Get him to stay!
–I don't know what to do!

676
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,600
–I won't tell anyone, OK?
–Please don't go. You'll ruin everything.

677
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:33,052
Look, I'm not gonna stay down here and
listen to you fuck each other's brains out.

678
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,520
I'm trying.

679
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,896
–I'm leaving too!
–Not you as well

680
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,480
I'm not playing gooseberry.

681
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,560
I'm not staying down here.

682
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,880
Are you going straight home?

683
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,480
We could stop by the station
and get a pizza. I'm starving.

684
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,880
–No. Thanks, though.
–C'mon, trains go to London all the time.

685
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,120
Yeah, no. I… I know.

686
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,960
I'm gonna go by Amber's, see if we can
patch things up. Things have been awful.

687
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,840
Amber? But she humiliated you.

688
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,760
How the fuck would you know
anything about that?

689
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,240
Enjoy yourselves. I'm outta here.

690
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,440
Hey, Mikey? Your weed, mate.

691
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,240
–Mate, you said you'd do this.
–You said it'd be fun.

692
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,480
–It is!
–For you. You'll have a great weekend.

693
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,850
–We could have fun. Please.
–You're gonna get laid. Enjoy this.

694
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,280
Come on, Mike. Please. Stay.

695
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,640
You're gonna have a great time.

696
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,706
You'll be here completely by yourselves.
Enjoy it, all right?

697
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,160
–I hate him.

698
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,786
–What's up, Liz?
–Something's wrong! I can't open the door!

699
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,840
Can you move out of the way?

700
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,640
Watch this.

701
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,560
Fuck! It won't open.

702
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,240
–Well, push it, you twat.
–The handle's stuck.

703
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,720
You are such a donkey, mate.
Oi, Liz! Down. Let me sort it out.

704
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,760
–You are such a cretin.
–Look, I'm not fucking retarded, OK?

705
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,232
–The fucking door won't open!
–Get out of the way!

706
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,720
–Who was the last one down?
–It was Geoff.

707
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,918
–How fucking hard did you slam it?
–It wasn't me, it was Liz!

708
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:34,680
–It's a heavy door! It slammed itself.
–Doors don't just slam themselves locked.

709
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,200
Hello!

710
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,078
Sorry! I didn't know we'd get stuck, did I?

711
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,280
–This is bullshit!
–You're sorry⁈ That's just fucking great

712
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,080
What do we do? Do we just fucking rot?

713
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,080
I guess… we just wait to be found.

714
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,320
In two days, my parents are going to be
up there waiting for me.

715
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,102
If I'm not there, they'll know I told a pack
of lies and I'll be up to my arse in shit!

716
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,840
Good point. My parents'll go berserk!

717
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,840
Good fucking job, asshole!

718
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,120
–How long before we're found?
–I don't know!

719
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,880
Shit! I am in so much trouble!

720
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,400
Perfect

721
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,360
Help! Anyone! Help!

722
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,760
–Somebody try the glass.

723
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,200
We have to do something
that might open the fucking door!

724
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,000
–Well, what'll we fucking do?

725
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,640
Fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!

726
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,400
You all right? Why don't we sit down?

727
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,800
Thanks.

728
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,040
It's been a nightmare for forensics.
They can barely lift a usable print.

729
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,720
It'll take us six months to sift through
all the hair and fibre we lifted.

730
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,960
What about the listening devices?

731
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,520
The kids probably mistook
the small air vents for microphones.

732
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,916
Lack of food and water would have
made them confused and paranoid.

733
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,280
So do you have anything
to tie Martin Taylor to the scene?

734
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,200
Not yet.

735
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,240
But he will have left
something somewhere.

736
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,240
And we'll find it.

737
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,480
Right. Thanks.

738
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,440
Open the door! You bitch! Open the door!

739
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,880
Liz! Liz!

740
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,120
Liz!

741
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:27,280
–Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!
–Bullshit!

742
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,480
–Bullshit!
–I'm sorry!

743
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,546
How could you do this to me, Lizzie?
You fucking betrayed me!

744
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,200
No! They let you go! I knew they would!

745
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,320
They've tapped my phone,
they tried to follow me here!

746
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,000
–They want me for the whole thing!
–They can't prove anything!

747
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:49,200
–If they could, they would have by now!
–You grassed me up, you bitch!

748
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,000
Hello?

749
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,720
Hello?

750
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,520
What happened?

751
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,800
You've got to get me out of here!
Please. I don't feel safe.

752
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,920
I don't want to be alone.
I don't feel safe.

753
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,000
–All right. All right. Liz…
–Please. Please!

754
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:33,880
Liz, come on. Calm down.
Take a deep breath. Come on. Calm down.

755
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,066
Listen, I can help you,
but you've got to stop playing games.

756
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,320
Some people
need to know what happened.

757
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,120
They don't care how terrible your story is.
They want to know the truth.

758
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,600
I want to know the truth too!

759
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,040
I want to go back to the hole.

760
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,920
Absolutely not! No way.

761
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,360
I keep getting glimpses of what happened.

762
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:23,554
I'll be doing something like tying my laces
and I'll turn around… and I'll see Frankie.

763
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,000
But when I try to remember, I can't.
There's nothing.

764
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,160
Nothing at all.

765
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,760
And I don't know what happened.

766
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,440
I want to know, but I can't remember.

767
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:50,040
Do you want to be re-admitted?
And we can work through this.

768
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,440
No.

769
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,920
I need to go back to the hole.

770
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,720
There's no escape, Tom.

771
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,560
Mrs Dunn called again,

772
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,320
pissing and moaning
Dr Horwood's run away with her child.

773
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,880
Saying she'll call the press, the Complaints
Commission, if we don't find her!

774
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,040
All right. But I bet you they're having
a bloody pizza somewhere.

775
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,200
–D'you want the rest?
–Go on. Amaze me.

776
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,458
I will. It's about Martin Taylor.

777
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,720
Come on.

778
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,200
Come on!

779
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,560
Looks different.

780
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,360
I don't even feel like
I've been here before.

781
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,520
Liz.

782
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,280
Liz.

783
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,800
Hey, Mikey? Your weed, mate.

784
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,480
You are the cretin.

785
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,480
Dude, you're getting laid.
It's gonna be a great time.

786
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

787
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,000
We weren't locked in from the outside.

788
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,360
Shit! I am in so much trouble!

789
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,360
Fuck! Shit, I don't believe it! The stupid…

790
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,320
Did you try the glass?

791
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,320
What could I do?

792
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,040
I couldn't let him leave.

793
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,000
Carry on.

794
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,560
–Guys, guys! The water's gone off.
–Are you sure?

795
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,032
–I just went for a drink. There's no water.
–What?

796
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,600
What? What? What's happened?

797
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,920
After you start to feel thirsty,

798
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,040
you find yourself feeling impatient.

799
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,520
Maybe even a little sick.

800
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,040
Then your pulse starts to go up.

801
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,320
Then there's the headaches, dizziness…

802
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:10,520
When it gets bad, your vision will blur
and you'll find it hard to walk and talk.

803
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,000
Your tongue swells up.

804
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,120
Your skin shrivels.

805
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,600
You twitch.

806
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,960
You go deaf.

807
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,880
And then you die.

808
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,680
How long does this take?

809
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,880
From when we run out of water,
about three or four days.

810
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,560
–How do you know all this?
–Army cadets.

811
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,040
Liz! Lizzie!

812
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,640
Lizzie, it's gonna be fine!
It's gonna be OK, Liz!

813
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,800
We're bound to get rescued!

814
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,080
They'll find us. They will! Next week
we'll be down the pub having a laugh.

815
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,640
–I promise you.

816
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,440
And I'm buying, all right?
It's gonna be all right.

817
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,760
We'll go out and buy lots of new things.

818
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,120
And there's all those exciting exams
to look forward to.

819
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,280
Can we look on the positive side?

820
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,884
No, I've got a hard-on for those exams.
They're great.

821
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,040
–You've got a hard-on for everything.
–Not for you, mate.

822
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,040
I'm OK.

823
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,040
Have you ever loved someone so much…

824
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,050
you didn't care what happened
to yourself?

825
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,080
You just had to be with them.

826
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,760
If they look at you,

827
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,800
your heart stops.

828
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,800
If you feel their breath on your skin,

829
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,240
you just ache.

830
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,880
Have you ever craved someone so much…

831
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,164
that you didn't exist any more?

832
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,280
No.

833
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,080
Well, I have.

834
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,520
Guys!

835
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,640
Hey, guys! Liz!

836
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,840
Guys! Liz!

837
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,520
–Frankie's sick.

838
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:08,564
Look, I'm serious. She's very, very sick.
It just keeps coming out of her.

839
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,760
So you're fucking her now?

840
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,480
He really doesn't kiss
the way I thought he would.

841
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,400
I always thought he'd kiss me really soft,

842
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,800
–…but he kisses really hard.

843
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,920
You know, you could have told me
about you and Mike.

844
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,920
But I suppose it doesn't matter any more.

845
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,080
We're getting on so well!

846
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,160
It's like we've been together for ages.

847
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,120
–I think he's falling in love with me.

848
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,520
–He is. Yeah, he is, I can feel it.

849
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,960
–We'll probably sleep together tonight.

850
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,360
–I bet we'll get out tomorrow.

851
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:17,080
I have a really strong feeling we'll get out.
Like… like someone will find us, right?

852
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,560
–Do you think you can hang on that long?

853
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,800
Frankie?

854
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,320
Franks? Frankie?

855
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,120
Frankie!

856
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,960
–Frankie!
–Get away from her!

857
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,760
Frankie…

858
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,960
–Frankie, wake up!

859
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,200
–Frankie, speak to me!
–Oh, my God!

860
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,960
What's wrong?

861
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,480
Oh, shit! What have you done to her?

862
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,920
Frankie, what's wrong? Wake up!

863
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,440
What's wrong?

864
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:23,440
–Frankie…
–Geoff. Oh, my God. Fuck.

865
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,640
You fucking killed her!

866
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,480
What have you done?
What have you done to her?.

867
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,600
–I didn't…
–What did she do to you?

868
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,760
Geoff.

869
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,640
Geoff.

870
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:44,120
Geoff, it's fucking horrible.
Please stop touching her. Please, Geoff.

871
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:48,400
She's fucking dead!
Stop fucking touching her!

872
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,120
I'm so sorry, Frankie.
Frankie, I'm so sorry.

873
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:14,040
What… what…
what happened, what did I do?

874
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,560
You were my best friend.

875
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,600
What am I going to do? I'm sorry, Frankie…

876
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,400
Frankie…

877
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:26,360
Don't fucking look at me like that!
I hate it when people look at me like that.

878
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,030
It's not my fault
if you don't like what I have to say.

879
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,840
Frances was bulimic. We know that
from the lack of enamel on her teeth.

880
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,880
The dramatic bleeding
came from a tear in her œsophagus.

881
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,280
She died on the tenth day
from heart failure.

882
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,680
Carry on.

883
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,720
Do you think she'll haunt us?

884
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,880
She'll haunt you.

885
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,800
Why me?

886
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,840
Why you? Why you⁈

887
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,880
You fucking bitch!
Because it's your mistake!

888
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,880
Your idea, your fault! You!

889
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:20,040
–Does that help at all? It's shit in here.
–You!

890
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,960
She's sorry! Isn't it obvious? She didn't
do it on purpose! Just fucking leave it!

891
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,120
You didn't care about fucking Frankie!

892
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:34,000
You're right. I didn't give a fuck about
Frankie. We're just a pair of assholes.

893
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:42,280
I keep thinking
about her mum and her dad…

894
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,720
and how they're going to feel
when they find out.

895
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,040
I've killed all of you! I killed…

896
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,920
–No, you didn't.
–I did, it's my fault! I'm sorry!

897
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,840
Look, OK? It's not your fault, OK?
It's not your fault.

898
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,906
I don't know what happened to Frankie,
but it wasn't you, OK?

899
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,280
–Really?
–Really. OK?

900
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,640
So what we've got to do
is try our best to keep strong.

901
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,560
I don't really blame you, Liz.
I'm just going nuts.

902
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,120
I keep thinking I can smell the body.

903
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,600
I think I'd rather tear my face off…

904
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,320
than smell her rot.

905
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,920
I've got such a terrible headache.

906
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,640
Everything's blurry.

907
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,560
I know what that means.

908
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,480
It's all right, Geoff.
Don't think about it.

909
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,160
Take it.

910
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,520
Take it.

911
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,040
Thank you.

912
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,760
–You OK?

913
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:38,240
–I'm sorry… Mike…
–What are you talking about?

914
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,120
–I'm sorry.
–You're not well, you should lie down.

915
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,480
I have to tell you something.

916
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,280
–Lizzie, it's the dehydration.
–No. Mike… No, Mike.

917
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,880
No. Mike, listen.

918
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,000
Please stop torturing yourself, OK?

919
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,080
Please. It's not important any more, OK?
It's not your fault.

920
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,800
No, I have to tell you something.

921
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,560
–What?

922
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,040
–You fucker!
–No, Mikey! I was going to share!

923
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,880
–No, stop!

924
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,960
Geoffrey Bingham. Severe head injuries.

925
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,840
This one was murdered.

926
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,440
Oh, my God.

927
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:17,320
Look. We could go together.

928
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,560
Fuck, no.

929
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,080
I can't do this any more.

930
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,220
This food will keep us going a little longer.
We could still be found.

931
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,080
We're not going to be found.
They would have found us by now.

932
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,800
Look. Mike, it'd be really quick, right?

933
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,840
–We'll just fade away and it'll be over…
–You're stronger than that!

934
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,960
We've kept going this long,
we can hold out. Please!

935
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,200
It's worth it.

936
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,600
Lizzie, I can't do this without you.

937
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,446
You've kept me going.
If you go, I'll have nothing.

938
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,000
I need you.

939
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,000
I love you, Liz.

940
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,880
I… I love you.

941
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,000
How the fuck did you do that?

942
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,640
The key.

943
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,720
I always had it.

944
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,600
But I couldn't tell you. How could I?

945
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,840
But it… it was all for you.

946
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,680
For me?

947
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,040
Because I love you.

948
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,200
All this was for you.

949
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,920
For me?

950
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,120
I killed my best friend.

951
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:24,280
You let me think I was going to die,
and you watched me kill my best friend.

952
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,040
I killed him for a fucking Coke!

953
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,120
You let Frankie die!
You fucking held her hand…

954
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,600
and you let her die, you fucking bitch!

955
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,360
Fuckin' whore!

956
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,560
–No, Mike…
–You fucking bitch!

957
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,120
–You don't understand! I didn't mean…

958
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,840
Mike, no! What are you doing?
You don't understand!

959
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,680
What are you doing? Stop it! No, Mike!

960
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:58,400
–No!

961
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,840
He was the reason I breathed.

962
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,080
I stayed there,

963
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,480
felt my heart die,

964
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,040
my soul wither.

965
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,920
I wanted to be with him so much…

966
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,720
that I could just feel myself
stepping into the air.

967
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,360
Then I thought, at least this way,

968
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,600
he never grows old,
he never cheats on me.

969
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,960
He never leaves.

970
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,360
This way he just… stays perfect.

971
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:15,440
You need to say
what you've just said to me on tape,

972
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,170
with a solicitor and your parents present.

973
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,480
Why?

974
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,160
Your statement needs to be official.

975
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,640
–I'm not making a statement.
–You have to.

976
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:35,000
That's what the families and everybody
—the police—have been waiting for.

977
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,800
I just told you:
they're not going to understand.

978
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,240
Look, even you don't understand.

979
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:46,320
I don't see why I should be punished.
It was an accident!

980
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,760
–You're still responsible.
–I'm not ruining my life for this!

981
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,240
It's out of your hands. Martin will
corroborate what you've told me.

982
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:58,280
Everyone is dead,
and you told them that I locked you in!

983
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,680
I was away!
I had no idea you couldn't get out!

984
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,520
It's too late.

985
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,560
No!

986
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:30,520
–Philippa! What the fuck are you doing?
–Help! Help!

987
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,200
–Thank God. Thank God.
–What's wrong?

988
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,920
–Help! Help!
–It's OK.

989
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,560
–I thought she was going to hurt me.
–It's over. We have Martin.

990
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,640
You're in deep shit.

991
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,640
–You have Martin?
–Yeah.

992
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,440
Suicide.

993
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,160
Guilty as hell.
