179
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:33,541
from the horrors
you experienced.

180
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,642
There's nothing to learn.

181
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:39,645
There are no new insights

182
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,283
or discoveries.

183
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:44,984
So, is he real?

184
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,586
Who?

185
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,689
The Boogeyman.

186
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,256
I read you quoted...

187
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,492
You don't believe
in the Boogeyman?

188
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:58,164
I believe in Michael Myers,
deranged serial killer, but...

189
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,403
the Boogeyman, no.

190
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,573
Well, you should.

191
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,608
Okay.

192
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,643
Michael Myers is a human being

193
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,746
who killed his sister
when he was six years old.

194
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,450
Then he came after you.

195
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,551
We just want to know why.

196
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,453
We want a glimpse
inside his mind.

197
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:23,023
That's why your story
is so important.

198
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,027
My story?

199
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:27,562
AARON:
Two failed marriages.

200
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:31,499
Rocky relationship with your
daughter and granddaughter.

201
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,572
Michael Myers
murdered five people.

202
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,308
And he's a human being
we need to understand?

203
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,577
I'm twice divorced.

204
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,548
And I'm a basket case.

205
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,084
They're transferring him.

206
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,487
Tomorrow, 7:00.

207
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,690
He'll-he'll be locked away
until the end of his days.

208
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,427
That's the idea.

209
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:01,029
Let's talk about
when the state came

210
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,598
to take your daughter away.

211
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,333
She was 12 years old.

212
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,635
They said you were
an unfit mother.

213
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:09,474
How long until
you regained custody?

214
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,710
I didn't.

215
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,648
But you already knew that.

216
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:21,283
Laurie, we saw him.

217
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:23,687
We met with Michael.

218
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,121
I showed him the mask.

219
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:28,090
There was nothing.

220
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:30,827
No response. Nothing.

221
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,796
He won't talk to anyone.

222
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,298
Never has, but...

223
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,368
I think he might speak
with you.

224
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,104
So, why don't you sit down
with him

225
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:46,643
and say all the things
you must be longing to say.

226
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:49,112
Come with us,

227
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:52,284
and let us help you
free yourself.

228
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:54,721
Please.

229
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:02,729
LAURIE:
Time's up.

230
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,400
I'll accept my payment.

231
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,739
Get out.

232
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:16,274
You want to shit under my sink?

233
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,844
I will murder you
and your whole family.

234
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,312
- (CHUCKLES)
- (SIZZLING)

235
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:23,615
I switched from marshmallow
fluff to peanut butter.

236
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,417
See if those little bastards
eat that.

237
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,185
- That ought to kill them.
- Morning.

238
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,822
I rescheduled my last session,
so I can make it tonight.

239
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:32,391
You really didn't
have to do that, Mom.

240
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,792
It's not a big deal.

241
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,427
RAY: You made it into
the National Honor Society.

242
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,762
- KAREN: Yeah.
- That is a very big deal.

243
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:38,797
I just made it to the top
of my shop class,

244
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,834
making birdhouses and, uh,
a checkerboard made of teak.

245
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:45,704
- (CHUCKLES)
- We're excited to meet Cameron.

246
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,840
That whole family, though,
they had a reputation.

247
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,608
- KAREN: Ray, come on.
- RAY: But it's true.

248
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,276
- It's a relevant factor.
- Ray.

249
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:52,879
- Ray.
- Do you remember the one time Lonnie

250
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:53,913
punched that cop in the face?

251
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,213
- Ray.
- That was a...

252
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:56,716
- (TRAP SNAPS)
- Oh! Mother...

253
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,484
Oh, man!

254
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:00,486
I got peanut butter
on my penis.

255
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:01,921
- (RAY GROANS)
- Ew, Dad.

256
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,423
Instant karma.

257
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:05,325
Cameron is a good guy.
He's nothing like that.

258
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:06,926
You're gonna see
when you meet him tonight.

259
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:10,496
They're all nice guys
until they get you pregnant,

260
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,799
and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,

261
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,767
and you clean their guns,
and you got children,

262
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:17,470
and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,

263
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:18,738
and then y'all get fat.

264
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,840
Hey, Dad?

265
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:21,341
- What?
- Can you stop?

266
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,312
I gotta clean
this peanut butter off my hand.

267
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,556
Did you invite Grandmother
like you said you would?

268
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:38,258
About tonight.
You said that you'd...

269
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,827
- Oh.
- ...invite her.

270
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:42,229
Right. I did.

271
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,864
- You did?
- Yeah.

272
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,532
I talked to her yesterday.

273
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,735
She's not gonna be able
to come, honey. I'm sorry.

274
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:48,937
Really?

275
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:50,771
Yeah.

276
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:53,273
Baby, she's agoraphobic.

277
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,710
She needs cognitive
behavioral therapy,

278
00:15:55,712 --> 00:15:57,912
- so don't take it personally.
- (DOORBELL RINGS)

279
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,850
That's Vicky. I gotta go.

280
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:03,652
Hey, I love you.

281
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:06,388
Have a good day.

282
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,789
- ALLYSON: Bye, Dad. Love you.
- RAY: Okay.

ALLYSON:
<i>So, my mom's a liar.</i>

284
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,359
VICKY:
<i>What happened?</i>

285
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,727
(SIGHS)
She said that she invited

286
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:14,629
my grandmother tonight,
but she didn't.

287
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:16,431
I mean, she never even
contacted her.

288
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,968
- How do you know?
- Because I called her myself.

289
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,735
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:23,806
Dude, what's your mom's deal?
Why would she say that?

291
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:27,275
I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.

292
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,576
Everyone in my family, like,

293
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:31,747
turns into a total nutcase
this time of year.

294
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:33,816
If I were you guys,
I wouldn't celebrate, either.

295
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,519
I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.

296
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:39,422
Just skip all over the
creepy Halloween shit, right?

297
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:41,791
Does your grandma
ever talk about it?

298
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,959
Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.

299
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,328
It defines her life.

300
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,297
She's been traumatized
ever since.

301
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,399
Wasn't it her brother
who, like,

302
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,002
cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?

303
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:53,436
No.

304
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:55,404
That's just a bit
that some people made up

305
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:56,840
to make them feel better,
I think.

306
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:59,508
I mean, that is scary to have
a bunch of your friends

307
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,844
get butchered
by some random crazy person.

308
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,013
Is it, though?
Because, all things considered,

309
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:05,615
there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.

310
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:08,051
And, like, I mean, what,
a couple people getting killed

311
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,954
by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.

312
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:13,423
Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.

313
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:16,393
And she escaped,
and they caught him,

314
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:17,994
and now he's incarcerated.

315
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,364
I-I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...

316
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,967
Just shut the fuck up, Dave.

317
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:24,501
Shut up.

00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,970
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, shut up, Dave.

320
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,040

He's such a fucking moron.

- Oh, Jesus.

Cameron.

I got you.
That was a good one.

332
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:48,359
Yes, that was very good.

333
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,594
Hey, do you have everything

334
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,096
for your costume
tomorrow night?

335
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:53,765
- Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one, after all.
- Um...

336
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,969
no, I mean,
I-I'm more focused on tonight.

337
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:58,536
Tonight?

338
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,371
I-I thought you were joking
when you said

339
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:02,708
your parents
were old-fashioned.

340
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,042
- Be nice, okay?
- Okay.

341
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,644
It'll be fun.

- I need to calm down.
