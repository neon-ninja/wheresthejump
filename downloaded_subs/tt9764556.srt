Great.
You look healthy, Ms Kurahashi.

35

You're like a whole new person.

36

That's you.

but no one's looked after me
like you have.

00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:01,076
It's been tough, no?
Are things okay?

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,912
Isn't Dr Fujii strict with new staff?

41
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:07,708
You're perceptive.

If you have any trouble, tell me.
I'll kick his ass.

No one's stayed on this floor
longer than me.

So, when you have some downtime,
let's go and take it easy.

54
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:55,713

You'll never find a nicer boss.

Can't believe
she'd been here so long.

58
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:09,893
But, be careful.
She baked you cookies, no?

59
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:13,313
Maintain a professional
distance with the patients.

60
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:15,524
I know it's not easy but
that's a basic rule for us doctors.

The police brought her here.
She can't even say her name.

100
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:03,454

101

00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:44,554
She must give us something.

189
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:50,226
Can't you remember anything?

190
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:11,997
This is important!

191
00:20:12,998 --> 00:20:14,291
You must remember.

192
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:19,463
Maybe she had trouble
with the neighbours

193
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:20,589
and set the room on fire?

194
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:22,549
This is enough for today.

195
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,807
She's been through
a traumatic experience.

196
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,102
She needs time to recover.

197
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,959
Hello there!

198
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,711
Hello there.

199
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:02,880
- Here's the file.
- Thank you.

200
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:04,340
- I'm handing it over to you.
- Thank you.

201
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:15,184
Hello.

202
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:19,480
How are you?

203
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:26,946
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

204
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:37,206
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

205
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:43,837
<i>Sleep, sleep</i>

206
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:46,590
Come in.

207
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:57,058
That new girl is creepy.

208
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:00,729
She hardly eats at all.

209
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:03,982
If I mention it, she gives me a look.

210
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:07,735
When I talk to her, she says nothing.

211
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,411
Thank you so much

212
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:20,540
for changing the flowers.

213
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:23,167
I see. It wasn't me.

214
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,670
Then who?

215
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,306
- Look here!
- Isn't it sick?

216
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,100
- For real.
- Look at mine.

217
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:41,894
That's so stupid.

218
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:44,021
- Mine's cool.
- Not stupid.

219
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:45,314
Not stupid at all.

220
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:47,566
- What?
- Look!

221
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:48,692
- Scary.
- Creepy.

222
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,111
- Real creepy.
- Weird.

223
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:53,280
- Let's get her.
- Let's do it!

224
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:54,489
Come on...

225
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:59,703
Don't you have a name?

226
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:01,246
Can you speak?

227
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:04,916
No name? Your parents must be nuts.

228
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,418
Totally nuts.

229
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:09,254
Come on, say something.

230
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:14,467
Okay, from today,
you're gonna be Jane Doe!

231
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,219
Good old Jane Doe!

232
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:19,722
<i>Jane Doe, she has no name!</i>

233
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:22,975

00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:26,437

00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:48,542
What happened?

236
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:54,339
Are you hurt? Stay right there.

237
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:55,757
Are you okay?

238
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,046
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

239
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:06,034

240

241
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:15,627
Are you okay?

242
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:20,465

251

Jahmes got cocky before

252
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:48,159
so we thought to have
some fun with him this time.

253
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:50,786
He'll be by any moment.

254

259
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:00,796
<i>A truck?</i>

260
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:09,388
What?

261
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:10,889
What's up?

262
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:16,395
What is that?

263
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,294
Everyone's in the playroom.

264
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,130
Won't you go?

265
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,431
May I stay here?

266
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,486
I hear you don't eat much.

267
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:11,657
If you don't eat,
you won't get better.

268
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:14,076
Surely you don't want more shots.

269
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,916
Is my mum...

270
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,834
dead?

271
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,048
Do you remember...

272
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:30,258
the fire?

273
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:32,928
No, I don't.

274
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:37,390
Well then

275
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:40,310
what do you remember
about your life

276
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,188
before you got here?

277
00:27:46,107 --> 00:27:49,110
I was in a dark place
most of the time.

278
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,116
Mum would come and
bring me food.

279
00:27:57,785 --> 00:27:59,120
A dark place?

280
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,833
The closet.

281
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:08,713
But she would let me out
when she came back home.

282
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:21,642
You, too?

283
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,268
What?

284
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:27,689
You were lonely, too.

285
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:07,937
What is it?

286
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:17,113
Hey...

287
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:18,697
wait!

288
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,203
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

289
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,121
- Call the doctor.
- Got it.

290
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:27,998
Check her vitals.

291
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:29,750
Are you okay?

292
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,461
Her pulse is fading.

293
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,800
She's losing energy.

294
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:42,554
Her anorexia is the issue now.

295
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:45,974
It's like she's refusing to live.

296
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:49,603
You too? Are you all right?

297
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,233
Yes.

298
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,447

299
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:05,660
Ms Kurahashi kept asking
for your number yesterday.

300
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:07,036
What?

301
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:09,956
She said you're avoiding her.

302
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:12,375
Didn't you tell her no?

303
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:15,044
I didn't say yes.

304
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:19,715
You must refuse.

305
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,802
Transference can happen

306
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:24,345
even between doctors and
patients of the same gender.

307
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:29,225

There was a case of arson at that
residential complex last month.

332
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:55,350
He went there to shoot
an urban exploration video.

333
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,020
I tried to stop him.

334
00:31:58,228 --> 00:32:01,857
We can't run videos of crime scenes
involving death.

335
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,735
But he wouldn't listen.

336
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:12,075
As I figured, the police warned us
and made us delete it.

337
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,288
That fool.

338
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:20,333
We've had no contact since then.

339
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,628

340
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:27,382
but he was behaving oddly
the last time we met.

341
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,052

342
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:34,680

we're not going to get any views.

343
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,682
But there are still lines
we shouldn't cross.

you'll find it.

Hold it!

360
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,177
Why did you involve Kazuma?

361
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,516
Figured you could manipulate him?

362
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:06,061
- Not at all.
- Then why didn't you stop him?

363
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:07,896
I tried! But...

364
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,231
My brother...

365
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,401
he was proud to know you.

366
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:16,238
He thought he'd make it
with your help.

367
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:19,616
He quit school to do this.

368
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:21,868
What?

369
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:26,247
It might not have meant much to you

370
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,752

<i>An arson case in which
five people met their fate.</i>

395
00:36:58,104 --> 00:37:02,441
<i>As for the fire, the reason
given by the media was</i>

396
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:07,321
<i>that trouble with the residents
caused the incident.</i>

397
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:11,951
<i>But the thing is, this Sofue person
was really freaky.</i>

398
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:14,078
<i>The suspect, Sofue</i>

399
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,499
<i>Bet you wanna know
how nuts she really was.</i>

400
00:37:18,582 --> 00:37:22,628

403
00:37:26,632 --> 00:37:29,092
<i>She did fortune telling,
folk remedies...</i>

404
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:31,053
<i>shady things like that.</i>

405
00:37:31,136 --> 00:37:35,474
<i>This is why the other residents
harassed her.</i>

406
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:37,434
<i>They dumped garbage outside her unit</i>

407
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:40,103
<i>and even left a dead cat by her door.</i>

408
00:37:40,312 --> 00:37:42,397
<i>She was badly harassed.</i>

409
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:46,151
<i>Everyone, are you aware of

00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:49,946
<i>I'm on the ninth floor.</i>

<i>I'm at the entrance and everything
is covered by blue sheets.</i>

413

<i>It's low!</i>

414
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:01,457
<i>Made it. I'll now start
my investigation of</i>

00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:16,013

418
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:18,974
<i>Lots of graffiti here too.</i>

419
00:38:19,308 --> 00:38:22,520
<i>This place got hit hard.</i>

420
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,690
<i>Look, this one says Sofue.</i>

421
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,817
<i>I'm sure it's her place.</i>

422
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:30,778
<i>It's time.</i>

423
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:32,863

<i>Is this the hall?</i>

427
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:54,259
<i>I'm inside now.</i>

428
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:56,011

429
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,815

430
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:10,984
<i>I'm not sure but...</i>

431
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:16,322
<i>it's like the smell of the fire
still lingers in the air.</i>

432
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,866
<i>Check out the wallpaper.</i>

433
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:23,246

434
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:27,541
<i>There's an iron grill door,

435
00:39:29,502 --> 00:39:32,922
<i>And then, another door behind it.</i>

436
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:37,384
<i>This room alone has two doors.</i>

437
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:39,511
<i>Can you see it?</i>

438
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:41,889
<i>I'm heading in.</i>

439
00:39:42,264 --> 00:39:43,432

<i>The spots that are unburnt</i>

445

<i>show where the body was.</i>

446
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:02,158
Wait.

447
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,743
<i>Can't believe it, peeps!</i>

448
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,870
<i>Look what's still here!</i>

449
00:40:07,497 --> 00:40:10,500
<i>It's a mirror and a CD player thingy.</i>

450
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:14,087
<i>Look, the air conditioner.</i>

451
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:15,964

452

00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:21,386
<i>And look at this.</i>

454
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,181
<i>It's a shelf or a rack.</i>

455
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:28,476
<i>This is worse than I imagined.</i>

456
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,520
<i>It's like everything is still here.</i>

457
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,898
<i>This is too much.</i>

458
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:39,820
<i>What's that?
Hold on while I show it to you.</i>

459
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:42,990
<i>Look at the closet.</i>

460
00:40:43,532 --> 00:40:45,159
<i>It's got a chain.</i>

461
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,369
<i>There's something.</i>

462
00:40:47,786 --> 00:40:49,121
<i>Hold it.</i>

463
00:40:50,497 --> 00:40:52,207
<i>A padlock and a key.</i>

464
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:54,126
<i>This is really crazy.</i>

465
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,128
<i>Who puts a chain on a closet?</i>

466
00:40:58,922 --> 00:40:59,965
<i>Wait...</i>

467
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,135
<i>should I open the closet?</i>

468
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:04,886
<i>I'm gonna do it.</i>

469
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,555
<i>I'm opening it now.</i>

470
00:41:14,312 --> 00:41:15,355
<i>Whoa!</i>

471
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:16,815
<i>Huh?</i>

472
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:20,110
<i>What? Holy moly! Hold on here!</i>

473
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:22,445
<i>They're talismans!</i>

474
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,448
<i>A shitload of talismans!</i>

475
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:27,408
<i>On the ceiling too!</i>

476
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,911
<i>And over here</i>

477
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:31,913

478
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:33,748
<i>No way.</i>

479
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,792
<i>Wait. Hold on there.</i>

480
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:43,257
<i>I think these are dolls
and toys for kids.</i>

481
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:45,426
<i>They definitely are.</i>

482
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:47,303
<i>What the...</i>

483
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:50,014
<i>It's a rice bowl. A rice bowl.</i>

484
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,561
I was in a dark place

485
00:41:57,354 --> 00:42:01,817

The man who saw him last
said he was acting odd.

502
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:10,567
It's not enough to suggest
he committed suicide.

It's not that...

What are you doing?

522
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,727
Oh, doctor!

00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:41,190
Sorry, I left something.
Ms Ohno gave me a key.

You noticed?

00:48:16,474 --> 00:48:19,936
No one else bothers.
You like flowers, right?

529
00:48:24,023 --> 00:48:26,442
I use this to cut the flowers.

Please stop!

536
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:41,498
That's not what I mean.

537
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:44,877
Then why are you backing away?

538
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:48,589
Why are you afraid of me?

Why am I so mad at you?
Don't be conceited!

549

00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,370
Why do you make me feel like this?

551
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:05,289
Are you all right?

552
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:09,584
Come on!

553
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:15,966
Wake up.

554
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,644
Come on, please.

555
00:50:28,561 --> 00:50:29,729
Wake up.

556
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:41,758
Sadako...

557
00:51:52,852 --> 00:51:55,896
Come on! Hurry!

558
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:22,839
Akikawa!

559
00:52:23,632 --> 00:52:24,800
Akikawa!

560
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:27,969
What's the matter?

561
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,846
Wake up.

562
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,556
Are you okay?

563
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,682
Akikawa!

564
00:52:32,766 --> 00:52:34,434
I'll take her to ICU!

565
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,186
Akikawa!

566
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,063
Hey!

567
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:40,565
You okay?

568
00:52:41,232 --> 00:52:43,193
- Hey!
- Ms Kurahashi!

569
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:47,905
Ms Kurahashi, what happened?

570
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:50,074
Ms Kurahashi,
I'd like to examine you.

571
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:51,701
Can you stand up?

572
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:53,995
Let's stand up.

573
00:52:54,996 --> 00:52:57,790
What's wrong? Please calm down!

574
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:00,042
Get a wheelchair!

575
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:01,502
It's okay.

576
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:05,214
Got it, I won't touch you.
It's all right. Calm down.

577
00:53:05,297 --> 00:53:06,424
Look, it's all right.

578
00:53:07,466 --> 00:53:10,177
Let's get on the wheelchair.

579
00:53:34,326 --> 00:53:36,870
Ms Kurahashi has been admitted.

580
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:40,123
Her condition was improving,
but now...

581
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:43,960
I'm sorry.

582
00:53:44,544 --> 00:53:45,962
It's not your fault.

583
00:53:53,303 --> 00:53:55,054
You need a break.

584
00:53:56,597 --> 00:53:57,849
You need to take care of yourself

585
00:53:57,932 --> 00:53:59,183
before you can take care
of your patients.

586
00:53:59,267 --> 00:54:00,852
How's the girl?

587
00:54:03,187 --> 00:54:04,480
She's still in ICU.

588
00:54:13,948 --> 00:54:15,324
And still unconscious.

589
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:18,661
Honestly, it doesn't look good.

590
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,668
Mr Fujii.

591
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,964
I...

592
00:54:31,507 --> 00:54:33,383
I saw something weird.

593
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,723
When Ms Kurahashi attacked me.

594
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,896
I saw a woman with long hair.

595
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:42,367
You are Sadako.

596
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,412
The reincarnation of Sadako.

597
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:53,128
You are a harbinger of misfortune.

598
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:56,881
You are destined to take life...

599
00:55:58,049 --> 00:55:59,509
as did Sadako!

600
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,364
Sadako.

601
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:09,160
Dr Akikawa!

602
00:57:10,328 --> 00:57:12,497
She can't talk now.

603
00:57:13,414 --> 00:57:14,457
Doctor!

604
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,585
Please, don't. Doctor!

605
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:28,346
I'm here to talk about Sadako.

606
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:32,433
Please tell me.

607
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,519
My brother is missing.

608
00:57:38,272 --> 00:57:41,066
He has probably seen her too.

609
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,818
Ms Kurahashi

610
00:57:42,902 --> 00:57:45,446
you called that thing Sadako.

611
00:57:46,113 --> 00:57:49,491
Please tell me! What is she?

612
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,503
When I was in high school

613
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:04,798
my friend died.

614
00:58:07,342 --> 00:58:08,927
Not just her.

615
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:12,472
Many people did.

616
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:15,475
All of them...

617
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:17,852
got killed.

618
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:22,482
It was the curse of Sadako.

619
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,027
Curse?

620
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,989
A long time ago

621
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:34,118
a psychic killed herself.

622
00:58:36,078 --> 00:58:37,788
She was clairvoyant.

623
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:41,417
Her reputation grew gradually.

624
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:46,881
One day, she was maligned
and labelled a fraud.

625
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:49,467
Because of that...

626
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:52,344
she killed herself.

627
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:57,099
Her daughter was...

628
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:00,811
Sadako.

629
00:59:03,647 --> 00:59:04,940
With just a thought

630
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:08,777
Sadako could strike a person dead.

631
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:13,031
She was far more powerful
than her mother.

632
00:59:19,037 --> 00:59:24,000
Alas, her life ended abruptly.

633
00:59:27,712 --> 00:59:29,839
Fearful of her power

634
00:59:30,507 --> 00:59:32,133
her father threw her...

635
00:59:35,011 --> 00:59:36,054
down a well.

636
00:59:36,429 --> 00:59:39,182
Sadako was tossed away and killed.

637
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:47,940
That's the origin of the curse.

638
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:53,487
All who come in contact
with her curse

639
00:59:54,947 --> 00:59:56,282
were killed.

640
00:59:58,367 --> 01:00:00,119
Including my friend.

641
01:00:00,703 --> 01:00:01,829
Everyone.

642
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:05,666
A curse.

643
01:00:07,459 --> 01:00:08,502
No way.

644
01:00:08,836 --> 01:00:10,712
I have no doubt it was Sadako!

645
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:15,676
It's true, I tell you!
The curse exists. I've seen it!

646
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,461
It is not possible to save him.

647
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,298
Your brother

648
01:00:56,382 --> 01:00:57,800
has been cursed.

649
01:01:03,597 --> 01:01:05,641
<i>That hurt!</i>

650
01:01:07,726 --> 01:01:09,770
<i>Man, I could hear my back cracking.</i>

651
01:01:10,854 --> 01:01:13,816
<i>Next time for sure! On to round two!</i>

652
01:01:14,024 --> 01:01:16,819
<i>I'll try it backwards. Gently...</i>

653
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:25,035
<i>There! The Wrinkled Mug!</i>

654
01:01:30,874 --> 01:01:34,336
Where are you, Kazuma?

655
01:01:34,503 --> 01:01:38,465
<i>This was Fantastic Kazuma!
Subscribe to my channel!</i>

656
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,709
Kazuma?

657
01:02:51,786 --> 01:02:52,954
Hello?

658
01:02:53,997 --> 01:02:56,374
<i>It's Ishida. Sorry to call suddenly.</i>

659
01:02:58,084 --> 01:02:59,627
I found Kazuma.

660
01:03:00,962 --> 01:03:04,632
He's in the video
we uploaded earlier.

661
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:06,509
<i>I know.</i>

662
01:03:10,429 --> 01:03:13,891
I saw the video too.

663
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,439
Oshima?

664
01:04:46,064 --> 01:04:48,233
Yes, Oshima Island in Izu.

665
01:04:48,859 --> 01:04:52,195
I did an image search.
I think it's correct.

666
01:04:53,321 --> 01:04:56,616
It's a place where
mountain ascetics trained.

667
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:59,411
<i>Mysterious Spots in Tokyo, Izu Cave</i>

668
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:03,164
Many priests lost their lives here.

669
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:07,961
The shrine was built
to appease their souls.

670
01:05:09,337 --> 01:05:13,299
But a cave-in made it off-limits
for the past 20 years.

671
01:05:16,886 --> 01:05:18,930
Do you recognise this talisman?

672
01:05:24,811 --> 01:05:26,312
<i>It's got a chain.</i>

673
01:05:26,938 --> 01:05:28,564
<i>Should I open the closet?</i>

674
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:31,734
<i>Whoa! Huh?</i>

675
01:05:31,817 --> 01:05:33,569
<i>They are talismans!</i>

676
01:05:39,825 --> 01:05:40,993
Like the complex?

677
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:44,663
Sofue was connected to this place.

678
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:47,583
What does that mean?

679
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:49,626
I don't know.

680
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:53,338
First of all,
how was the video uploaded?

681
01:05:56,717 --> 01:05:57,759
<i>I think</i>

682
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,180
<i>this is an incredible find and...</i>

683
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:07,185
I first saw it here.

684
01:06:08,562 --> 01:06:11,231
Do you know about the cursed video?

685
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:13,066
What?

686
01:06:13,566 --> 01:06:16,027
It was all over the Internet.

687
01:06:16,694 --> 01:06:19,572
I don't know who found it first

688
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,494
but at some point, it was mixed in
with other videos.

689
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:28,748
Then, a rumour started saying that

690
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:30,958
the video creators were cursed.

691
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:33,961
A curse...

692
01:06:34,962 --> 01:06:37,006
It's just an urban legend.

693
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:52,563
"The psychic, Yamamura Shizuko

694
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,274
to be publicly tested."

695
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:57,109
Supernatural powers?

696
01:07:06,451 --> 01:07:08,370
Is this the woman in the video?

697
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:13,291
The psychic
who killed herself was real.

698
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:15,085
What?

699
01:07:16,628 --> 01:07:18,672
She was born on Oshima Island.

700
01:07:19,214 --> 01:07:21,841
Sadako must have been too.

701
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:24,135
Sadako?

702
01:07:28,598 --> 01:07:29,849
Kazuma is...

703
01:07:30,433 --> 01:07:31,851
in Oshima.

704
01:07:42,737 --> 01:07:43,905
Hello?

705
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:46,240
Hello, this is Fujii.

706
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:50,578
Don't be alarmed but...

707
01:07:52,037 --> 01:07:53,622
Ms Kurahashi has died.

708
01:07:54,623 --> 01:07:55,666
What?

709
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:59,253
When the nurse found her
this morning, she was already...

710
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,338
One, two, three!

711
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:19,898
What is it?

712
01:08:21,024 --> 01:08:22,651
I must save Kazuma.

713
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:24,402
Wait, you mean...

714
01:08:29,741 --> 01:08:30,784
Mayu!

715
01:08:33,995 --> 01:08:35,163
I'll go with you.

716
01:08:36,122 --> 01:08:38,249
I got Kazuma into this.

717
01:09:11,323 --> 01:09:12,783
Aren't you cold?

718
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,119
Let's go inside.

719
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:29,966
What was it Kazuma saw?

720
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,679
The last time we met

721
01:09:35,221 --> 01:09:36,765
he said he'd seen it.

722
01:09:40,852 --> 01:09:42,562
Kazuma became cursed.

723
01:09:44,022 --> 01:09:46,649
Do you really believe in curses?

724
01:09:47,275 --> 01:09:48,735
I saw her too.

725
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:51,154
Sadako.

726
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:00,746
At the complex

727
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,040
he saw Sadako

728
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:09,213
in the room
where the girl was imprisoned.

729
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:17,638
A girl who shared
the same fate as Sadako

730
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,309
has resurrected the curse.

731
01:11:02,265 --> 01:11:03,307
Let's go.

732
01:11:09,313 --> 01:11:11,315
<i>No large tents
are allowed in the area</i>

733
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:13,442
<i>Oshima Fisherman's Union</i>

734
01:11:13,526 --> 01:11:16,654
<i>Keep Out</i>

735
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:29,083
Please wait here.

736
01:11:32,211 --> 01:11:33,629
Hold it there!

737
01:11:34,463 --> 01:11:35,839
What are you doing?

738
01:11:36,673 --> 01:11:39,426
Hold it! Can't you read?

739
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:42,763
My brother is in the cave shrine.

740
01:11:43,221 --> 01:11:45,515
Please, we have to save him.

741
01:11:45,599 --> 01:11:46,641
What?

742
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,665
Is someone in the cave?

743
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:16,712
This isn't a place for sightseeing.

744
01:12:18,089 --> 01:12:21,592
You have no idea what this place is.

745
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:26,722
Many were swept away from

746
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:29,642
the banks of this sacred shore.

747
01:12:30,935 --> 01:12:32,978
Those that are unwanted

748
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,773
are washed away by the sea.

749
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,358
Infanticide.

750
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:42,863
Unwanted babies

751
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,616
were put in the shrine and

752
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,994
carried out to sea.

753
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:51,746
Souls of children

754
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:56,126
killed by their parents
gather in the shrine.

755
01:12:58,503 --> 01:13:00,380
Sadako thrives on them.

756
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:03,883
Sadako.

757
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:06,845
Do you know Yamamura Sadako?

758
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:10,181
It's impossible today.

759
01:13:10,723 --> 01:13:11,975
It's the spring tide.

760
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:13,768
Spring tide?

761
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:16,729
Tonight is the full moon.

762
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:19,065
It will be high tide.

763
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,528
Go in there and
the sea will drag you down.

764
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:40,044
The full moon.

765
01:13:41,086 --> 01:13:42,129
Of course.

766
01:13:43,422 --> 01:13:44,465
Look.

767
01:13:50,304 --> 01:13:52,014
The video is changing?

768
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:53,890
How?

769
01:13:57,102 --> 01:14:02,065
<i>Dangerous cave
Do not enter</i>

770
01:14:08,154 --> 01:14:09,698
We can't go in today.

771
01:14:10,115 --> 01:14:14,285
The tide is getting too high.
Maybe tomorrow...

772
01:14:14,369 --> 01:14:15,954
- It'll be too late!
- Why?

773
01:14:16,037 --> 01:14:17,705
We must go now or he'll be...

774
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:21,084
It'd only be another disaster.
Please understand.

775
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:24,337
- Hold on...
- Don't be stupid!

776
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:26,255
- Calm down!
- Get off!

777
01:14:26,339 --> 01:14:28,299
Calm down!

778
01:14:44,023 --> 01:14:45,524
If the full moon rises

779
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:49,737
Kazuma will...

780
01:14:50,738 --> 01:14:52,489
Don't be so ominous.

781
01:14:53,866 --> 01:14:56,451
He was always there for me.

782
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:02,291
Kazuma and I...

783
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:05,585
grew up in an orphanage.

784
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:12,384
I was in grade school
when we were abandoned.

785
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,564
What's up, Sis? Not hungry?

786
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,079
Check out my new move!

787
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,707
The wrinkled mug!

788
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,973
Souls of children

789
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:06,186
killed by their parents
gather in the shrine.

790
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,984
Could it be that Kazuma and I...

791
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,656
have been summoned by Sadako?

792
01:17:17,714 --> 01:17:18,757
Mayu!

793
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,457
<i>Keep Out</i>

794
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:42,297
Kazuma...

795
01:18:43,339 --> 01:18:44,591
he's behind those rocks.

796
01:18:45,425 --> 01:18:46,885
How did he get in?

797
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:23,337
Kazuma.

798
01:19:30,302 --> 01:19:31,511
No!

799
01:19:34,973 --> 01:19:36,933
Mayu...!

800
01:19:59,122 --> 01:20:00,164
Dammit.

801
01:20:59,013 --> 01:21:00,140
Kazuma.

802
01:21:03,852 --> 01:21:05,603
Where are you, Kazuma?

803
01:22:09,207 --> 01:22:10,250
Kazuma!

804
01:22:11,376 --> 01:22:12,710
What happened?

805
01:22:13,586 --> 01:22:14,963
Pull yourself together!

806
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,049
Kazuma.

807
01:22:26,182 --> 01:22:27,308
Kazuma!

808
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:28,976
Hey!

809
01:22:57,879 --> 01:22:59,006
No way...

810
01:23:31,704 --> 01:23:32,872
Sadako.

811
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,557
I'm sorry, Sadako.

812
01:23:55,436 --> 01:23:57,396
It is the only way.

813
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:31,512
Sadako's mother abandoned her.

814
01:24:34,349 --> 01:24:37,852
But she didn't die. She survived.

815
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:41,314
That's how

816
01:24:42,398 --> 01:24:44,609
she gained her fearsome powers.

817
01:25:06,255 --> 01:25:07,464
You, too?

818
01:25:08,715 --> 01:25:09,925
Abandoned by your mother?

819
01:25:50,965 --> 01:25:53,801
Pulse: 53,
blood pressure 57/31.

820
01:25:53,884 --> 01:25:55,469
SpO2: 93%.

821
01:25:55,553 --> 01:25:56,637
Status?

822
01:25:56,721 --> 01:25:57,763
Still in a coma.

823
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,931
Vital signs?

824
01:25:59,056 --> 01:26:00,391
Temperature: 35°C.

825
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,145
- Blood data?
- How much IV is left?

826
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:06,397
She's showing signs of cyanosis.

827
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,773
- Not good.
- Add more to the IV.

828
01:26:07,856 --> 01:26:09,858
I will. Take this.

829
01:26:09,942 --> 01:26:11,652
She's starting to asphyxiate.

830
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,654
- Doctor!
- Check SpO2!

831
01:26:13,737 --> 01:26:14,947
Got it.

832
01:26:15,489 --> 01:26:16,532
Legs up!

833
01:26:17,616 --> 01:26:19,201
All right? Hang in there.

834
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:20,577
Fight!

835
01:26:20,661 --> 01:26:21,787
Hold on. Please!

836
01:26:22,954 --> 01:26:25,165
Stay with us!

837
01:26:34,299 --> 01:26:35,342
No!

838
01:26:40,388 --> 01:26:41,598
Don't give in!

839
01:26:44,017 --> 01:26:45,852
You're not alone!

840
01:26:48,062 --> 01:26:50,356
You have me!

841
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:53,401
I'll care for you!

842
01:26:54,026 --> 01:26:56,112
I'll never let you die!

843
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:23,931
Doctor, she's conscious.

844
01:27:25,265 --> 01:27:26,391
Vital signs?

845
01:27:26,475 --> 01:27:27,809
Stabilised.

846
01:27:29,019 --> 01:27:30,520
SpO2 is rising.

847
01:27:31,355 --> 01:27:32,397
Blood pressure?

848
01:27:32,564 --> 01:27:34,900
118/79. Stabilising.

849
01:27:36,193 --> 01:27:37,903
Her colour has returned.

850
01:29:11,994 --> 01:29:13,037
Mayu!

851
01:29:14,288 --> 01:29:15,414
Are you all right?

852
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:25,132
Wait here.

853
01:29:25,216 --> 01:29:26,258
Kazuma!

854
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:28,636
Hey, Kazuma!

855
01:29:28,802 --> 01:29:30,221
Are you okay, Kazuma?

856
01:29:30,304 --> 01:29:34,183
Kazuma! Snap out of it!

857
01:29:34,266 --> 01:29:36,268
Kazuma! What's happened to you?

858
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:38,979
Hey, Kazuma!

859
01:29:39,646 --> 01:29:41,982
Kazuma, what's wrong?

860
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:43,775
Come on!

861
01:29:44,568 --> 01:29:46,486
Hey! Kazuma!

862
01:30:14,722 --> 01:30:16,182
Snap out of it!

863
01:30:19,769 --> 01:30:20,895
Kazuma!

864
01:30:24,273 --> 01:30:25,316
Sis!

865
01:30:52,134 --> 01:30:53,260
Sis!

866
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,928
Run!

867
01:30:55,846 --> 01:30:56,972
Get away!

868
01:30:57,931 --> 01:30:59,266
Kazuma!

869
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:02,269
Sis! Stay back!

870
01:31:02,352 --> 01:31:03,436
Mayu!

871
01:31:09,943 --> 01:31:11,361
Get off!

872
01:31:12,195 --> 01:31:13,446
Kazuma!

873
01:31:17,617 --> 01:31:19,160
Yusuke, take her!

874
01:31:40,681 --> 01:31:41,807
Sis...

875
01:31:42,808 --> 01:31:44,018
Forgive me!

876
01:31:46,186 --> 01:31:47,563
Kazuma!

877
01:31:50,899 --> 01:31:53,527
No, Kazuma!

878
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:55,779
No!

879
01:31:58,866 --> 01:31:59,950
Mayu!

880
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:01,076
No!

881
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:02,202
No!

882
01:32:02,286 --> 01:32:03,328
Mayu!

883
01:32:15,674 --> 01:32:17,842
Kazuma!

Dr Akikawa.

886
01:33:18,443 --> 01:33:20,028
Before she leaves

887
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:23,990
she said she wanted to talk to you.

888
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:36,836
Your voice.

889
01:33:37,587 --> 01:33:38,880
I heard it clearly.

890
01:33:43,176 --> 01:33:46,596
I could come back
all thanks to you.

01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,351
