1
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,803
Maya?

2
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,450
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,792
- Did you finish your reading?
- Yeah.

4
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,190
Most of it.

5
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,666
You know how everyone's complaining
about how dangerous the city is...

6
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,569
...and how they wish they could go back
to the good old days when it wasn't?

7
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:08,076
Well, it turns out there never
really were any good old days.

8
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,007
It's always been
a hell hole.

9
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,724
You don't find me fascinating anymore?

10
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,390
What?

11
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,599
- Babe, are you all right?
- No.

12
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,460
- No?
- No.

13
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,796
Some Russian cabbie
jumped a curb today...

14
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,563
- Yeah.
- And knocked a pedestrian...

15
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,968
...through a storefront window.
I got there just as they were...

16
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,770
...loading the body in the bag,
and I thought I got the shot...

17
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,705
...something that the <i>Post</i>
would buy, you know, but...

18
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,181
- I don't think it's good enough.
- What if I had some good news for you.

19
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,720
You know, like news that meant
you could throw away your police radio...

20
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,654
...and only shoot the stuff you want.
Forever and ever.

21
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,854
I'd marry you.

22
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,190
That's it?

23
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,194
What else do you want?

24
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,763
Well...

25
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,130
...how about...

26
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,208
...you in a bed...

27
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,669
...not worrying about anything...

28
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,940
...for at least an hour,
except how to make me and yourself...

29
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,211
...really, really happy.

30
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,752
- It's a deal.
- Yeah?

31
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,479
- Yeah.
- You like that?

32
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,683
You like that? That's good. So...

33
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,290
You know how you're wishing
Jurgis would introduce you...

34
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,398
...to some of his fancy
art-world friends?

35
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,625
And you can never understand
why he doesn't?

36
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,534
Well, I called him today and I said:

37
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,534
"How come you don't introduce Leon...

38
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,403
...to any of your fancy friends?"
Do you know what he said?

39
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,669
- What?
- That he didn't do it...

40
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,713
...because he figured that
when you were ready, you would ask.

41
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,746
So I asked for you.

42
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,715
Isn't that great?

43
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,919
Do you know who Susan Hoff is?

44
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,428
Of course. You're kidding.

45
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,994
Do I look like I'm kidding you?

46
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,834
- You're meeting her tomorrow.
- Are you kidding me?

47
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,300
No.

48
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,408
Does my hour start now?

49
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,788
Whatever you do, don't mention Maya.

50
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,362
What? Why?

51
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,296
Susan likes her artists
young, male and single.

52
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,265
Actually, you know what?

53
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,304
The male part isn't that important.

54
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,513
Here we go. Come on.

55
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,873
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello.

56
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,815
- Sorry that we're late.
- Oh, don't apologize.

57
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,924
Punctuality means nothing to me.
It's a virtue for the mediocre.

58
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,295
You know when I first knew
that Basquiat was a genius?

59
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,124
When he was three days late for lunch.

60
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,266
So tell me about your work.

61
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,464
Explain it to me. What interests you?

62
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,973
- The city.
- Why?

63
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,840
Because no one's ever captured it.
Not the way it really is...

64
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:32,507
...the heart of it.
That's my goal, that's my dream.

65
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,178
Then you're failing.

66
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,588
You were at the right place,
weren't you?

67
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,699
- Yeah.
- But not the right time.

68
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,902
The image grabs our attention,
sure, but so what?

69
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,701
It's melodrama, arresting but empty.

70
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,742
I want to know what comes next. I want
to see the face of the businessman...

71
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,439
...when the filth touches him.

72
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,278
The next time you find yourself
at the heart of the city...

73
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:13,289
...stay put, be brave, keep shooting.

74
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,393
Then come see me.

75
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,601
- She hates my work.
- No, she doesn't.

76
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,936
When she hates somebody's work,
she gives them about a minute.

77
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,476
- You got three.
- So, what? She likes it?

78
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,945
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

79
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,386
You think she's right, don't you?

80
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,629
She's not.

81
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,402
Oh, no, no, no.

82
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,073
Time to pay the toll, baby.

83
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,037
Leave me alone, please.

84
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,309
Yeah.

85
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,545
- You gotta pay on your knees, baby.
- Hey!

86
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,294
What the fuck you gonna do, bitch?

87
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,700
Why don't you come
up here and find out.

88
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,301
What?

89
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,803
That's good.

90
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,595
Yeah, that's great.

91
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,708
All right, stop right there.
Right there. Stop. That's perfect.

92
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,410
Ever starred in a movie before?

93
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,299
Yo. Let's go.

94
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,819
Dead motherfucker.

95
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,657
You okay?

96
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,124
Thanks.

97
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,892
Most people would have ran away.

98
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,132
Oh, yeah.

99
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,465
I didn't this time.

100
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,334
Yeah.

101
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,864
Thanks.

102
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,298
- Hey, babe?
- Yeah.

103
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,696
You seen my purse?

104
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,503
- Yeah, it's on the chair.
- Okay.

105
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,978
When did you take these?

106
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,441
Last night.

107
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,250
You have to show these to Susan Hoff.
What you said she wants...

108
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,520
...I mean, this is it.

109
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,779
Yeah, you think so?

110
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,621
Yeah, because if it's not,
I hope I never see it.

111
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,854
Hey. Good morning.

112
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,554
Morning.

113
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,459
Babe, I'll see you later.

114
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,428
All right.

115
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,707
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks, babe.

116
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,978
Hands off.

117
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,850
- No fucking way.
- Come on, one last time.

118
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,248
I said never again.

119
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,583
If I don't care that your disgusting
grease gets all over my tofu...

120
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,420
...why do you care that tofu
would get over your grease?

121
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,687
Because my customers, real Americans
with blood in their veins...

122
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,958
...they don't want their cheese steak
within a mile of a bean curd.

123
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,466
- It makes me wanna puke.
- They're never gonna know.

124
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,229
- I'll know.
- Tofu's tasteless.

125
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,736
- Now you admit it.
- Of course.

126
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,098
My gramps, God rest his soul...

127
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,507
Jesus. If he saw me do this,
he'd rise and make a sausage out of me.

128
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,739
Yeah, and your regular customers
would gobble it right up.

129
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,267
Maya.

130
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,872
That's the same girl, right?

131
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,264
She's a model.

132
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,104
"Erika Sakaki disappeared
after leaving a downtown club...

133
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,870
...shortly after 2 a.m."

134
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,742
Oh, my God.

135
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,342
- What?
- That's right when I shot her.

136
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,547
I gotta go.

137
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,314
- Where are you going?
- Cops. I'll call you later.

138
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,826
And they ran off after you made
your presence known.

139
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,797
No, you see them? No, no.

140
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,563
It wasn't until I pointed out
the surveillance camera.

141
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,569
That's what made them leave.

142
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,670
- Where did they go?
- I thought that they left...

143
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,346
...but it's quite possible,
and that's why I'm here...

144
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,175
...to say that perhaps they went
down another stairwell...

145
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,579
...and entered the same train
that she went on.

146
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,485
And you?

147
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,713
I told you. I...

148
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,255
I did not get on the train.
I left on foot.

149
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,861
- Okay.
- Okay?

150
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,899
Well, I'm sure anything
you need to know...

151
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,193
...will be on that surveillance tape.

152
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,200
Do you sell your photos?

153
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:24,536
What? Yes, but not like this.
Police calls mostly.

154
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,574
Erika's a pretty big model.

155
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,413
Tabloids be interested in these.

156
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,049
Really? I wouldn't know.

157
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,282
- Is that so?
- Yeah. I wasn't stalking her...

158
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,182
...if that's what you're indicating.

159
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,756
Look, I... I saw these guys.

160
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,587
I thought that they looked
suspicious, so I followed them.

161
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,889
But you did continue
to photograph her?

162
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,301
Well, yeah, yeah, but...
I guess so, but...

163
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,428
Why?

164
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,279
When you come up
with an answer, call me.

165
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,706
What?

166
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,545
It's nothing.
I didn't imagine you to be...

167
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,647
...the person that would say, "whoa."
- I'm not.

168
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,283
I don't.

169
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,220
I haven't said it since high school.

170
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,290
But that's how good it is.

171
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,596
I'm having a group show
in three weeks.

172
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,699
Get me two more images that strong...

173
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,708
...and you'll be a part of it.

174
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,083
Okay.

175
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,611
Oh, good.

176
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,791
Without your unconditional
love and support...

177
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,055
...and without you finally introducing
me to one of your contacts...

178
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,528
I can't believe you made me wait
so long.

179
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,092
- none of this
would have been possible.

180
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,995
I love you both.

181
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,536
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

182
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,811
- Now, I must depart.
- What? No.

183
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,487
- What? Where are you...? What?
- Two more images.

184
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,588
That's not tonight. No.

185
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,013
Why can't...?

186
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,388
- Two more shots. That's all I need.
- What about these shots?

187
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,538
Hey, tell your wife to relax.

188
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,284
Sweetie, I take the train every day.
Safer than walking.

189
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,478
But you hear these stories.

190
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,626
That was ages ago. Look, no graffiti,
air conditioning works.

191
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,387
You can understand the conductor.
It's a new century.

192
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,294
We're getting at off the next stop,
so you can do what you want...

193
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,663
...but we're getting off, okay.

194
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,635
All right, fine. You know what?
We can go back to my place...

195
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,775
...and Leigh here can cook us...

196
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,208
...a nice romantic dinner for three.
- Did we just miss our stop?

197
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,649
- You'd have to talk my wife into bed.
- You're into it.

198
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,408
- Randle.
- Wait a second, honey.

199
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,087
You know, it's cheap wine.

200
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,580
Cheaper than the plate.

201
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,848
- Maybe if you didn't sleep...
- Randle.

202
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,252
- What?
- What trips me out...

203
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,825
Randle!

204
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,267
Randle!

205
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,052
No!

206
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,493
Why are you doing this?

207
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,299
No!

208
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,450
I'm sorry, mister, I...

209
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,450
I just wanted a picture of you.

210
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,520
Sometimes I don't know
what I'm thinking.

211
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,010
- Hey, buddy?
- What?

212
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,712
Mind if I take a look?

213
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,322
- Officer, you can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

214
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,324
Orange Alert and above,
I can search whatever I want.

215
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,258
How do I know
you don't got explosives?

216
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,022
It's a camera.

217
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,773
Yeah. Life's like a box of chocolates.

218
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,094
What the hell is going on?

219
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,458
Supposed to be a local.

220
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,970
This is a citizen's arrest.

221
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,409
Damn.

222
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,059
Damn!

223
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,832
I'm gonna shove
that hammer up your ass!

224
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,674
I'm very disappointed in you, Mahogany.

225
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,081
Clean up the mess.

226
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,154
Jeez.

227
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,820
God.

228
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,697
- How'd you get in here?
- The spare key.

229
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,005
Okay, before you freak out...

230
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,206
...let me just say it's not
an engagement ring...

231
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,972
...until I make enough money, but it's...

232
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,207
It says that we're engaged
to be engaged.

233
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,010
It's not bad, hey?

234
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,914
No.

235
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,627
- I have horrible taste.
- No, you don't.

236
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,393
- It's beautiful.
- You think so?

237
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,267
It should fit.

238
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,244
I can't imagine my life without you.

239
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,118
Don't even try.

240
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,855
I love you.

241
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,470
Baby.

242
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,605
No!

243
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,787
Who's this guy?

244
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,788
Oh. I don't know. A butcher.

245
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,493
He was at the station the night
that model disappeared.

246
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,260
Are they for your show?

247
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,236
- No, there's just something about him.
- Yeah, I'd say.

248
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,171
But why are you following him?

249
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,107
It seems like you should be
working on your stuff for Susan.

250
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,283
No, no, I know,
but if that model's still missing...

251
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,975
...and he was at the station...
- Yeah, so just, you know...

252
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:47,155
...give a picture
to the cops and move on.

253
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,292
I mean, people disappear all the time.

254
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,552
Whatever happened, they'll figure it out.

255
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,307
- What?
- What?

256
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,339
What's wrong?

257
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,778
How can I put this delicately?

258
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,981
You look like shit.

259
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,746
Give me a break.
I'm working my ass off.

260
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,947
Doing what? Contracting TB?

261
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,127
Hey, Otto, take a look
at the dying man over here.

262
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,159
What the fuck happened to you?

263
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,123
What are your specials?

264
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,001
We have brisket on rye,
turkey meatloaf on rye...

265
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,097
...chicken parmigiana on r...

266
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:12,003
What? What's the big deal?
It's one bite.

267
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,812
Fuck it. Give me one of these.

268
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:23,326
You sure about that? It's a steak. Meat.

269
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,017
Absolutely.

270
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,478
Hey.

271
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,288
I know I look like shit.

272
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,391
More of the butcher?

273
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,532
That's where he works.

274
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:14,210
Babe, listen to me.
I don't care if you eat meat.

275
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:19,542
I eat it all the time.
But this thing with this butcher...

276
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,547
Shouldn't you be focusing
on your work?

277
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,118
Oh, God, remember what you told me?

278
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:28,155
About how people are always missing
for all sorts of reasons, right?

279
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,347
- Right?
- Yeah.

280
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,495
Usually, there's a reason.
I've been thinking about that lately.

281
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:36,097
Look at this. These pins represent
missing people for the last 3 years.

282
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,497
Not one of them has ever turned up.
No letter home. No call for money.

283
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,467
Not even a corpse. Nothing.
They just vanished into thin air.

284
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:47,303
- Okay, so what do you think happened?
- Well, it's not chance.

285
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,310
Somebody's abducting them.

286
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,041
And they never find the bodies
because he takes them here.

287
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,776
- He butchers them?
- Yeah.

288
00:45:56,987 --> 00:46:00,047
- Baby... Listen to me. I'm sure...
- Look at this. Look what I found.

289
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,781
This is...

290
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,154
So some guy
was accused of kidnap...

291
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,332
- A guy who worked...
- This is a century ago.

292
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,160
A guy who worked in the same plant.

293
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:14,030
What are you saying?
You saying that it's the same person?

294
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:17,071
Is that what you're saying?
I don't understand how that works.

295
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,469
How does that work? How...?
Was he reincarnated?

296
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,837
No, no. I don't know. Maybe, but look...

297
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,344
...the point is that it's happened before.
It can't be a coincidence.

298
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,349
No, this guy's involved somehow.
I know it. Look at this. Look at this.

299
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,487
I was there the night that it happened.

300
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,986
She got abducted.
This is the train she went in on.

301
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,217
That's his hand. You know how I know?
I took another photograph...

302
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:41,227
...of him going down into the subway,
the same subway. I totally got him.

303
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:44,594
This is the guy, Maya. It's been
happening. There's been abductions.

304
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,669
It's happened. I don't know
if it's a copycat, but I got him.

305
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,964
This is not what's going on, okay?

306
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,075
This is all fake, okay? It's not.

307
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,973
No more. No more night shoots.

308
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,546
No more, please. Just day shoots.

309
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,717
I don't want you to shoot terrible things.

310
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,011
I want you to stop
with the conspiracy theory.

311
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,120
I want you to stop with the butcher.

312
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,120
I just want you to shoot
the stuff that makes you happy.

313
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,885
What makes you happy?
What do you love?

314
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,019
Please.

315
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,693
Don't leave me.

316
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,170
You, I love you.

317
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,005
I love you.

318
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,179
I got it.

319
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,447
That's good.

320
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,672
I'm sorry.

321
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,942
Why?

322
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,206
I'm sorry.

323
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,526
Jurgis showed me a picture
of that broad...

324
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,228
...that's gonna make your boy
rich and famous.

325
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,499
Yeah? So?

326
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,678
What do you have to do to get a date
with a broad like that, huh?

327
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:16,179
Magically transform into someone
who does not call women "broads."

328
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:24,755
Maya. Can I talk to you for a second?

329
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,896
No fucking way.

330
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:30,362
No. Come back later. She's busy.
Come back later.

331
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,636
You okay?

332
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,896
You were right.

333
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,302
That's all I wanted to say.

334
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,119
Candy. You want to buy some candy?

335
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,721
Sorry, man.

336
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,528
Whatever, man.

337
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,172
You want to buy some candy, mister?

338
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,778
- Go to somebody else.
- Come on, man, buy some candy.

339
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,982
Was that a game or what?

340
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,017
Oh, shit.

341
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,736
Hey! Open up!

342
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,777
Open the fucking door!

343
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,274
Open the fucking door!

344
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,241
My God.

345
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,782
- Who is it?
- It's me.

346
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,363
Oh, thank God, baby.

347
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,156
Where have you been?

348
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,528
Leon, what's the matter? Leon.

349
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,830
Leon, what's going on?
Leon, what's the matter?

350
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,573
Leon?

351
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,511
Babe, come on, open up.
What's going on?

352
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,543
Leon, open the door.

353
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,622
Leon, you're scaring me.

354
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,720
Please open the door.

355
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,390
This is not fair, Leon.

356
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,866
Open the door.

357
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,066
Open this fucking door now!

358
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,370
You know you can't do this.
This is not fucking fair.

359
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,515
You cannot just be out, gone all night,
and just disappear...

360
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,207
...and then fucking lock the door
in my face.

361
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,685
- I need to sleep.
- No, no, no, baby, baby, baby.

362
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:00,727
Babe, babe, babe, what happened?
What happened?

363
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,756
Oh, God. What is this?

364
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:05,992
Honey.

365
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,700
We have to get you
to a hospital right now.

366
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,803
I followed him into the subway.

367
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,308
Wha...?

368
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,645
It's always the late train.

369
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:24,081
Probably the same one each time.
He waits for it to empty out...

370
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,717
...and then he kills them.

371
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,292
He butchers them like cattle.

372
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,752
I saw it.

373
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,726
I took pictures.

374
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:42,401
They never find the remains because
he unloads the meat somewhere.

375
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,107
We have to...
I have to call an ambulance.

376
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,743
There's an abandoned
subway station...

377
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,041
...underneath the meat plant.
- Okay.

378
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,886
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna take you to the hospital...

379
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,146
...and when the doctors
are working on you...

380
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,847
...I'm gonna take your pictures,
take them to the cops.

381
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,323
They won't listen. My camera's gone.

382
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,497
- What?
- He took it from me.

383
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:12,361
- That's the only proof I have.
- Baby, it's gonna be okay.

384
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:16,334
I'm gonna call an ambulance, okay?
I'm gonna fix it.

385
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,874
- It's okay.
- No.

386
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,382
They'll think I'm a lunatic.
They'll think that I killed Erika.

387
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,021
I know. I want to help you.

388
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:36,657
Help me. I want to help you.

389
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,292
No.

390
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,829
Sleep.

391
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,857
My opening's tonight.

392
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,314
- We're as crazy as he is.
- No, we're not.

393
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,012
Because we know what
we're doing is insane.

394
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,025
He doesn't.

395
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,696
What else are we gonna do?
Jurgis, what else?

396
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,865
We need his camera.
We need to see what he saw.

397
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,702
Jesus Christ.

398
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,336
No, no, no.

399
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:34,374
I want you to wait here.
If he comes back...

400
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,838
...just make a sound, okay? Hey.

401
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,593
- Jurgis.
- What if he comes back?

402
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,497
If he comes back, we're screwed.

403
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,298
It's gonna go a lot faster
with two of us, okay?

404
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:41,408
I'm gonna go this way. Fuck.

405
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,114
Jurgis?

406
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,317
Jurgis.

407
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,677
- Miss Jones.
- Did you find Jurgis?

408
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:20,218
Calm down. Please, sit.

409
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,517
I just received the report
from an officer on the scene.

410
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:29,156
They went to the room you gave me.
There's nobody there.

411
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,262
But that can't be right.
They met the tenant in the lobby.

412
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,130
He let them examine the place.
He's been out the whole day.

413
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,736
No.

414
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,538
He's a butcher.

415
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,470
Leon says that he slaughters people...

416
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,201
...he kills them.
He's seen it, photographed it.

417
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:45,471
- What are you talking about?
- It sounds crazy.

418
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,548
I didn't believe it either.
But I was in his room.

419
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,946
I saw the tools he uses.

420
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:53,986
Okay, let's talk about
what really happened.

421
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:59,658
The tenant said a family heirloom
is missing, an album.

422
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,188
- He wants it back.
- It's a timetable.

423
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:05,094
With a check for every murder
going back a hundred years.

424
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,826
You cannot give that back.
It's the only proof we have...

425
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,834
Let me see it, please.

426
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,809
The tenant doesn't want
to press any charges.

427
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,443
He just wants his property back.

428
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,515
I don't have it.

429
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,808
Jurgis does.

430
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,877
You have to find Jurgis.

431
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:29,023
Look, you've already admitted
to breaking and entering.

432
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,251
That's very serious.
I could hold you for that alone.

433
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:35,919
If you do not go back with me,
I'm gonna go back with someone else.

434
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:38,793
And you'll be arrested, Miss Jones.

435
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,917
Phil and Sue Bennet.
They buy what I tell them to.

436
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:58,416
But to give themselves
the illusion of free will...

437
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:01,089
...they wait for my third suggestion.

438
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:05,016
The Kleins. They'll want some
alone time with you.

439
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,787
Just a little postmodern chitchat.

440
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,397
Humor them. It's a sale.

441
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,664
The Franks.
Now, they never buy photography...

442
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,395
...but if anyone can convert them...

443
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,670
Jack, Andi...

444
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,201
...I'd like you to meet Leon.

445
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,611
Andi thinks you're more like
a painter than a photographer.

446
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,281
Andi, that's...
That's very perceptive of you.

447
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,921
I actually started out as a painter.

448
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,024
Duty calls. If you'll excuse me.

449
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,731
Excuse me.

450
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,297
Sure.

451
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,705
Come on, your public awaits you.

452
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:35,310
I'm not holding my breath on that one.
A tad too bleak.

453
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,319
Leon?

454
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,885
Where are you going?

455
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,457
I said, where are you going?

456
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:49,622
I got a train to catch.

457
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,429
- No, you said medium rare.
- Hey.

458
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,196
Hey, zip it, huh?

459
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,637
It's hot. Hold on one second.

460
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:04,178
Hey, where the hell you been?
Excuse me?

461
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,041
- Where is it?
- Where's what? My...

462
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,409
Maya. All right, now you're
as crazy as your boyfriend.

463
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,415
What? Stop. What are you doing?

464
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,053
All right, Maya.

465
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:14,851
Stop right... Hey, hey!

466
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,581
Don't you... If you... Don't leave!

467
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,056
Maya! Maya!
Stay right there, honey...

468
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,922
Leon, are you there?

469
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:24,588
That butcher, baby, the butcher,
I think he has Jurgis.

470
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,496
You... I... That cop, detective, I...

471
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,295
Miss Jones.

472
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,571
I want the book, Miss Jones.

473
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:39,771
Tell me what's fucking going on.

474
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:41,744
Now.

475
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,910
Do you have any idea?

476
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,482
Where is Jurgis?

477
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,122
Tell me.

478
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,596
He's on the train.

479
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,235
14th Street. First one after 2:00.

480
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,715
No!

481
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,212
No!

482
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,782
No!

483
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,016
Oh, my God.

484
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:05,063
Maya.

485
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,545
Oh, my God, Jurgis.

486
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,807
Maya. Maya.

487
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,816
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

488
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,285
Oh, God. Oh, God.

489
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,460
No!

490
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,339
No. No!

491
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,253
Hey!

492
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,452
No, Jurgis!

493
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,521
No.

494
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,162
Leon?

495
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,002
Please, step away from the meat.

496
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,800
Take this...

497
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:29,552
Welcome.

498
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:04,290
He didn't have
what it takes anymore.

499
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:08,589
He knew it must be done.

500
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:09,785
It was a privilege.

501
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:16,329
I envy you.

502
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:01,137
Before you were born...

503
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:05,376
...or the birth of any other human thing,
that's how long.

504
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:09,018
Or longer. And now you found us...

505
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,491
...as only a few before you have.

506
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:16,653
The intimate circle
that keeps the secret...

507
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:20,191
...we protect and nurture them...

508
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:23,029
...and order is thereby preserved.

509
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:32,402
It must be done
to keep the worlds separate.

510
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,816
You'll understand soon enough.

511
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:28,498
- Now, serve as we all do...
- No.

512
01:33:28,703 --> 01:33:30,000
...without question.

513
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:07,367
<i>Police say Miss Jones</i>
<i>and Mr. Thompkins...</i>

514
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,042
<i>... are only missing at this point...</i>

515
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:12,542
<i>... although foul play has not</i>
<i>been ruled out. Elsewhere...</i>

516
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:15,375
<i>... preparations are underway</i>
<i>for the arrival of leaders...</i>

517
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,551
<i>... of several nations</i>
<i>in the European Union.</i>

518
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:19,549
<i>The mayor's office</i>
<i>issued a statement...</i>

519
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,847
<i>... supporting prospects</i>
<i>of new opportunities.</i>

520
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:24,684
<i>Meetings are scheduled</i>
<i>with local business leaders.</i>

521
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:28,794
<i>The meetings will include a tour of</i>
