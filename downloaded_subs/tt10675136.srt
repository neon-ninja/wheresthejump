1
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:41,282
I had a feeling
you guys were gonna call me

2
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,974
after what happened
with Russell.

3
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,080
Where are we gonna start?

4
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,572
After Hell House, I
thought that was it.

5
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:56,746
End of story.

6
00:00:57,747 --> 00:01:00,129
You know, they'd tear it down.

7
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:02,959
Well, not only did the
town not demolish it,

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,168
but nearly 10 years later,
one of the richest men

9
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:08,378
in the country is planning
to open it up again.

10
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,484
Had you
heard of the show Insomnia

11
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:13,280
before it opened
up at the Abaddon?

12
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,454
I knew it was a hit in New York,

13
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:16,904
that's about it.

14
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,639
And then, Vanessa Shepherd
takes over for Suzy McCombs,

15
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:29,192
on "Morning Mysteries".

16
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,884
And gets invited to film an
all-access, behind-the-scenes

17
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:34,887
episode of Russell
Wynn's Insomnia.

18
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:38,546
Hello everyone,
I'm Gregory Sandvick,

19
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,308
and I play Faust,
the lead, obviously.

20
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,826
What's your favorite thing

21
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,037
about doing this play here at
the infamous Abaddon hotel?

22
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,281
Honestly, there's nothing I like

23
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:50,800
about being here at this hotel.

24
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,664
Let alone having
something I like most.

25
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:53,986
I mean, the conditions
here aren't suitable

26
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,367
for high school theater,
let alone something

27
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:57,358
the scale of Insomnia.

28
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,302
But I'm not gonna, you
know, complain to the union

29
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:02,984
or anything, 'cause Russell's
paying us pretty well.

30
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,341
Russell's a complete visionary,

31
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:05,918
I have a lot of respect for him.

32
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:08,335
He's taken a
classic, like Faust,

33
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:11,234
and put this modern twist on it.

34
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:14,237
He's made it relatable for
even millennials, you know?

35
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,999
It's literally God
versus the devil,

36
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:20,726
they're playing this game
with Faust in the middle,

37
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,488
and Faust could be
anyone, Faust could be me!

38
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,317
I don't know what
Russell's plan is to get

39
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,421
an audience here.

40
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,906
I mean, the people in this town

41
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,391
don't really strike me as
the theater type, you know?

42
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:33,153
But don't judge a
book by its cover.

43
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:35,120
Unless that cover's
in upstate New York.

44
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:40,677
Think we're next!

45
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,093
Hey, what's up, I'm Max.

46
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,474
Hey Vanessa.

47
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,821
I play Mephistopheles.

48
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,996
My friend lazy Susan,
she's my partner in crime.

49
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:51,481
That's really cool,

50
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:52,448
would you mind if we actually
turned that off, though,

51
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,001
while we're doing the interview?

52
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,634
It's just kinda loud, it's
messing with the audio,

53
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,107
is that okay?

54
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:57,936
Sure.

55
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,489
Thank you.

56
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:00,766
No problem.

57
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,080
The last time this bar
was featured in a tale,

58
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,083
was when Hell House had
their celebratory spirits

59
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,913
right here in this
room, 10 years ago?

60
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,536
That guy that played Lucifer

61
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,470
was that guy from like Queens,
he had really thick New...

62
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:16,575
He'd be like, "Yeah,
welcome to Lucifer's cabin."

63
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,750
Lucifer's cabin, yeah.

64
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:22,029
This is like doing
Julius fricking Caesar

65
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,101
at the theater of Pompeii ruins.

66
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,448
Have you watched
the Hell House documentary?

67
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:29,139
Bits and pieces.

68
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:29,968
And none of what's shown

69
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,590
on it disturbed you?

70
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:32,694
Like what?

71
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,776
Well, the
unexplained things happening

72
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,253
to the crew.

73
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,739
What's that?

74
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:45,984
People disappearing here.

75
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:47,468
Here we go!

76
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:50,575
All right, Ben,
challenge accepted.

77
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:51,678
I'm goin' in.

78
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,064
Inanimate objects moving around

79
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,130
on their own?

80
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,417
I haven't seen the movie.

81
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,490
I don't know, it seemed
like one of those silly

82
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,975
found-footage films,
it's not really my thing.

83
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,608
I don't think, I
don't think I'll be watching

84
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,393
the film while I'm here.

85
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:16,221
At least you guys don't have to

86
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:17,981
stay overnight here.

87
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,881
They stayed overnight?

88
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,411
It's supposed to be
haunted, but I mean,

89
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:24,264
you would know
more than I would.

90
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,541
It is not haunted.

91
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:27,204
Have you heard any
bumps in the night?

92
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:28,830
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:29,934
It sounded like a scream.

94
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,929
- Holy shhhh...
- Oh, fuck.

95
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,242
Seen it?

96
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,865
I own it!

97
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:41,695
I mean, some pretty
messed-up shit

98
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:42,998
happened to those people here.

99
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:45,225
Tony, let me the fuck out!

100
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,078
Tony, fuck!

101
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:49,703
It doesn't bother you

102
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:51,498
that people died
here while, I mean,

103
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:54,570
putting on a show
like you guys are?

104
00:04:56,088 --> 00:05:00,576
Yeah, I will say I, I do
know where every exit is.

105
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:05,926
Hello? Anybody?

106
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,377
There's no knob!

107
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,733
What do you mean,
there's no fucking knob?

108
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,138
There's no knob!

109
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,702
There were
reports of several people

110
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,013
having gone missing and
their last known location

111
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:15,487
was this hotel.

112
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:17,938
Most recently the guests of
"Morning Mysteries" last year,

113
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,596
Mitchell Cavanaugh,
Brock Davies?

114
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,115
Have you head of any of this?

115
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:26,567
The hotel wants to be heard.

116
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:28,293
What the fuck is happening?

117
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:29,677
Let's get the fuck outta here.

118
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,778
Go, go, go, go, go!

119
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,717
My name is Vanessa Shepherd,

120
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,512
I was the host of
"Morning Mysteries"

121
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:44,067
when Russell took over
the Abaddon Hotel in 2018.

122
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,611
When my producers
came to me and said

123
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,107
that they wanted me to do
an episode at the Abaddon,

124
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,764
I said that I was
not interested.

125
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:55,838
Yeah, Vanessa
wasn't interested at all.

126
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:59,013
But once we mentioned
Russell Wynn,

127
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:01,671
her ears perked up a little bit.

128
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,949
The most striking thing,

129
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,469
other than what
happened that night,

130
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:09,438
was that Russell was very open
to allowing Vanessa and Louie

131
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,094
to film everything.

132
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,452
We thought it was a
long shot, and that

133
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,478
we'd never get called back.

134
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:24,487
Actually looking back,
maybe that was a red flag.

135
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,444
Ghosts sightings,
disappearances,

136
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:54,172
even reports of
demonic possession.

137
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,001
I, is this real?

138
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,210
Okay,.

139
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:01,213
All right, let's go again, okay.

140
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:03,561
With all of these
events happening,

141
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:07,116
all the history,
all the mysteries,

142
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,773
enter Russell Wynn,

143
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,811
the founder of Wynn Media Group.

144
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:16,470
An entrepreneur that made
his first million by 25,

145
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,335
and has since been
building a media empire

146
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,339
along with his hit
live-action interactive shows.

147
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,686
Russell took his love
of prominent theater

148
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,415
and poured it into a passion
project called Insomnia.

149
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,107
An interactive and
dark performance piece

150
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,869
that has received overwhelming
love from the press

151
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,078
and audience members.

152
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,977
I've been granted full
behind-the-scenes access

153
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:45,154
to the set of Insomnia,
in its very new location.

154
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:48,916
The Abaddon Hotel.

155
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,887
Okay, that's my intro,
can I meet Russell now?

156
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,716
Right now, no.

157
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,961
He's in a creative meeting,
they can go on for,

158
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,826
I don't know,
depends on his mood.

159
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:03,897
So after that?

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,589
Yeah, probably.

161
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:10,213
This is Jeff Stone,
Russell's head of?

162
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,008
- Operations.
- Operations, yes.

163
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:13,251
What does that entail?

164
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,633
Right now, keeping you occupied.

165
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,289
Russell wants me
to give you a tour

166
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:20,741
before we do introductions
with everyone.

167
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,331
You afraid to go in?

168
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:25,505
Aren't you?

169
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,484
You're doing a
behind-the-scenes documentary

170
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,476
on Insomnia at
the Abaddon Hotel.

171
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,700
You do realize you'll have
to go in eventually, right?

172
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:35,100
I know that, okay.

173
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,204
Good.

174
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,003
Honestly we were
all a bit hesitant

175
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:44,558
about going in at first but
it's really just wood and nails.

176
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,526
That's what Russell always says.

177
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,356
- Is that?
- From Hell House, yeah.

178
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,843
You'll see a few of their
things still laying around.

179
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:59,090
Ladies and gentlemen,

180
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:00,678
this is my buddy, Hector.

181
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,783
We haven't
fully made it ours yet

182
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,061
but it's really starting
to come together,

183
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,442
you might think.

184
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,826
Trust me you'll be fine, we've
been here for three weeks.

185
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:14,657
The only thing scary in
here is the asbestos.

186
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:18,292
Russell's made certain
some of the actors

187
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,767
and production staff will
be available for interviews.

188
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,216
Oh, including you?

189
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,186
Give you a quote right now,

190
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:30,604
I can't wait to get the
hell back to New York.

191
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,675
Oh, hey, Jeff, can
I post this on Insta?

192
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,057
Just make sure you clear
it with Russell first.

193
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,645
Thanks.

194
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,890
Alright, you'll like this.

195
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:43,030
Russell had the
old bottles pulled

196
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:47,448
and replaced with his personal
label out of California.

197
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:48,691
Ooh!

198
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,660
What's your wine of
choice there, hot shot?

199
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,040
Pretty impressive.

200
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:54,144
You think so?

201
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,629
Sure.

202
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,853
You can have about 15-20
boxes, how big is your van?

203
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,782
We're not moving that anyway.

204
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:00,496
- Okay, good.
- You'd be doing me

205
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
a big favor.

206
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,050
Sounds good.

207
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:05,087
Anyway, this room is
gonna be the most popular

208
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,848
set for the audience, I
think, along with the bar

209
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:10,989
- which is actually...
- Whoa.

210
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:12,301
Jeff, what's going on?

211
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,724
I'm still here, don't freak out.

212
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:14,900
- Okay, I'm not freaking out.
- Power's been spotty

213
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,339
for the past few days,

214
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:20,102
it usually comes back on
in about 10 seconds or so.

215
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,344
Okay.

216
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,701
You wanted the
Insomnia experience,

217
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:23,864
here you have it.

218
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:26,729
Sure getting it, yeah.

219
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,422
Here we go, like I said,
just about 10 seconds or so.

220
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:33,425
Alright, so shall we...
Power went out again.

221
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:34,668
Love the dark.

222
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,913
Thank you, Max.

223
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:39,293
Harvey.

224
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:41,295
Harvey, what can I do for you?

225
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,400
Do for me?

226
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,677
What can you do for me?

227
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:44,999
You can make me
a size two again.

228
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,507
But Russ, what
you can do for him

229
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,347
is know that he's finished
and we're in the basement.

230
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:49,959
He's no good with radios.

231
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:51,720
Harvey's the head of
artistic operations.

232
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:53,376
- Okay.
- He's also a big pain in my,

233
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,377
wait, what, where are you?

234
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:55,931
You're in the basement?

235
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:57,242
Aah,

236
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:58,875
because he still wants
to use it in the show,

237
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,221
because we all know
it's gonna be super safe

238
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,420
for my actors and not
a liability at all.

239
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:03,777
Did you hear my
side on your end?

240
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,562
I just wanna make sure
that was audible, copy.

241
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,264
Yeah, tell Russell
to meet me in the bar,

242
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:09,599
I'm not going in the basement.

243
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,740
After you meet Russell,
you'll love him.

244
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:12,741
- Great.
- We'll go through Heaven.

245
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:13,844
Sounds good.

246
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:17,435
Well, this is Heaven.

247
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,956
If you didn't figure
it out on your own.

248
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,019
This is where God'll make
his wager with the Devil

249
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:24,994
with our angels as his witness.

250
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,178
The white, a little cliché,

251
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,688
but that's what Russell wants.

252
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:31,637
I thought I saw something.

253
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,140
Otherwise you guys can...

254
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:34,141
- What?
- Someone.

255
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:35,246
What's going on?

256
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:37,075
What are you guys looking at?

257
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,491
Abaddon eyes, that's
what we call it.

258
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:40,907
Everybody feels like they

259
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,505
saw something out of
the corner of their eyes

260
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,462
or just felt like
they're being watched.

261
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:45,670
It happens to all of us,

262
00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:47,254
just our imaginations
messing with us.

263
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,608
Abaddon eyes.

264
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,023
You coming?

265
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:54,886
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Are you sure you don't wanna

266
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,715
just hang out?

267
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:56,681
No, no.

268
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,165
Okay, shall we?

269
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:01,823
So...

270
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:03,826
Oh, hey, guys.

271
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,448
Guess where I was
in the blackout?

272
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:06,622
Right fucking here.

273
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,830
Think about that.

274
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:08,624
That's why we
have a buddy system.

275
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,452
Fuck off.

276
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,834
All a... Okay.

277
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:12,938
Actors.

278
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,700
Here, makes his shit wine,

279
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:18,082
and he insists on using
the damn basement.

280
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:18,945
Hey, sweetie!

281
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,153
Hey, honey!

282
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:21,119
One of my least favorite
people in the world!

283
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,017
Well, right back at ya.

284
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,397
Where's your buddy here?

285
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:24,882
Where is he?

286
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:25,814
Old Russ is coming up
the stairs right about now.

287
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,263
You can't rush perfection.

288
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,300
Five, four, three and one.

289
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:31,474
Oh, there he is, Jeff.

290
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:32,717
How are you?

291
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:33,994
How you doing, wine-maker?

292
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,893
Huh. Didn't see you
down in the basement.

293
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:36,996
Not a peep.

294
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,171
Look at that.

295
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:39,068
- He opened it right up.
- You brought your

296
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,449
- camera crew.
- Hi.

297
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,415
- Hi, I'm Vanessa Shepherd.
- Russell Wynn.

298
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,519
It's nice to meet you,

299
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,383
- Russell.
- Pleasure to meet you.

300
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:44,177
Thank you for having us here,

301
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,626
we're really excited.

302
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,363
So you're the new
"Morning Mysteries" girl?

303
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,422
I am.

304
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,252
That's too bad, I liked Suzy.

305
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,464
Don't get me wrong,
she was a total bitch,

306
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,845
but I liked her.

307
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:00,089
And don't thank me yet.

308
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,642
Why is that?

309
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:02,896
Well, I'm sure you've
heard all the stories

310
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,300
about this place.

311
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:05,484
Everyone who enters
with a camera

312
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:06,855
never seems to make it.

313
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,270
Don't do that.

314
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,893
She barely came in as it is.

315
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:11,825
He's just kidding.

316
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,276
I'm just screwing with you.

317
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,692
Ah, well, we will try
to stay out of your way

318
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,900
as much as possible.

319
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,557
Just be two, no, thank you,

320
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,385
flies on the wall.

321
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:21,904
I appreciate that.

322
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:23,675
I like what you've done
with "Morning Mysteries".

323
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,149
Oh, I didn't
think that you watch?

324
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,322
He doesn't.

325
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:27,151
I do.

326
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,254
He does.

327
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:30,902
And none of your
guests have disappeared,

328
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:32,812
so you've got that on Suzy.

329
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,468
That is true, thank you.

330
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:35,849
Lawson, is it?

331
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:37,057
Louie, actually.

332
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:38,265
Uh-huh.

333
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:39,725
I'm a huge
fan of all of your shows

334
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,613
and everything that you've done.

335
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:42,822
You've got good taste.

336
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:43,788
And I give you full permission

337
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:46,032
to film to your heart's content.

338
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:47,654
And when you follow the actors,

339
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,449
they may moan and groan,

340
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,761
but it's all part of the show.

341
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,764
They're actors and they
secretly love attention.

342
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,352
Yeah, it's no secret.

343
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,907
Well, where should we start?

344
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,149
Let's meet everyone.

345
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,253
Yeah.

346
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,125
Ah, there he is.

347
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,644
Alright, everyone.

348
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:14,301
Welcome, welcome, so

349
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,717
Vanessa and her guy, Lonnie?

350
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,548
- Lonnie?
- Louie.

351
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,067
Louie!

352
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,690
They're gonna be embedded with
us for the entire duration.

353
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,174
They'll be filming everything,

354
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:26,486
so don't say anything

355
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,144
you don't want a few
million people to hear.

356
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:30,466
And I'll leave it
to you, Vanessa.

357
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,940
Thank you.

358
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,493
As you guys can see,

359
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,736
we've handed a few of you
your own mini-camcorders.

360
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,393
Why did we do this?

361
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,430
Well, we want to
encourage you to film

362
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,673
anything that you want.

363
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,400
Self-taped interviews, any
fun behind-the-scenes stuff

364
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:45,919
that we might miss.

365
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:47,507
And when we wrap here,

366
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,922
we'll grab everyone's cameras

367
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,304
and incorporate that
footage into the episode.

368
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,684
Make sense?

369
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:53,927
Question, Russell.

370
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:54,755
- Yeah.
- What happens if we catch

371
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,136
a ghost on camera?

372
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,588
That's a good.

373
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,901
Wow, great
question, really good.

374
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,764
In your case, Gregory,

375
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,215
you could ask it if
it's ever heard of you,

376
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,458
if it's ever seen you,

377
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:08,424
maybe seen your reel.

378
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:09,356
Probably has.

379
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,324
Some of your work, perhaps.

380
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:13,809
I was in that other thing
called Shakespeare In The Park,

381
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,329
I mean, I don't know.

382
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:17,675
Have you heard of it?

383
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:19,125
It was a brilliant,

384
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:21,196
brilliant summer
theater, thank you.

385
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,576
Which show were you in?

386
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,750
No.

387
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:24,934
- Don't, don't.
- Don't get him going.

388
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,683
"Into The Woods",

389
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:27,098
it was me and Amy Adams.

390
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:29,204
You and Amy Adams?!

391
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:30,999
You were like tree number three!

392
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:33,001
Two people played a
tree better than you.

393
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,450
Ooh.

394
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:35,969
Alright, take it easy.

395
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:38,144
Well, anyways, what I
really want everyone to do

396
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:40,767
is just pretend that
we're not even here.

397
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,218
If you've ever seen the
show "The Office", anyone?

398
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,496
Okay, well, we're
like that camera crew.

399
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,532
Just catching everything.

400
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:48,878
I hated "The Office".

401
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,019
- It was pretty...
- Minimalistic.

402
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,341
Yeah, it didn't make any sense.

403
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:53,687
Alright, they're a
pretty difficult group

404
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:54,850
to keep focused.

405
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,645
So let's stay on task, okay?

406
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,026
Wait, no.

407
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,382
- Question, Russell?
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

408
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,443
Could we still post
on social media or?

409
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:04,756
Yes, same restrictions,
keep it vague.

410
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,551
Yes, actually, we
encourage social media.

411
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,622
Just make sure to tag
"Morning Mysteries."

412
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,555
Okay, so #MM?

413
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,661
Actually, "Morning Mysteries".

414
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,662
So not MM?

415
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:14,559
No.

416
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:15,526
- The full...
- But I think MM

417
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:16,906
sounds better, it's like food.

418
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,149
It's like Mm.

419
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:19,806
And it keeps it vague, you know?

420
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:22,084
We want it to be not vague,

421
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,052
it's very specific,
"Morning Mysteries".

422
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,054
She's too bossy.

423
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,445
Right, well, this is going well.

424
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,264
I just wanted you
guys all to meet,

425
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,541
so here we are.

426
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:32,163
Bye.

427
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,475
Thank you, thanks.

428
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:34,855
I think, Gregory...

429
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,685
I believe we need to
go back to the city.

430
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,894
Believe it or not, the
wine's not selling like it...

431
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,171
I'm sorry, can...

432
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,115
Sorry, Jeff, can I just
interrupt for a second?

433
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,693
I was wondering if I could
give you guys cameras as well?

434
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,971
Ah, I'd love to, but no can do.

435
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:48,593
Gotta keep my hands free.

436
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,595
- Sorry.
- Okay, you know what?

437
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,419
We could probably get
a Go-Pro or something?

438
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,185
And Russell, can I
give you a camera?

439
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,706
I, I'm not gonna,
you know, use it.

440
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,845
That's okay,

441
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:00,374
- I understand.
- I'm not a camera guy.

442
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,031
But we just want you
to have it, just in case,

443
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,816
you don't have to use it if
you don't want to, it's fine.

444
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,818
Good, let's just
get this real quick.

445
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,235
Just come up with
us and we'll help you,

446
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:10,753
whatever you need, okay?

447
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:12,617
- So cold in here.
- Just...

448
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,722
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh my God!

449
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:14,550
Go, go, go!

450
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:15,896
Go, go, go, go!

451
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,422
Look at this.

452
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:26,528
Whoa!

453
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,633
That's creepy.

454
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,017
Whoa.

455
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,121
Would you look at that?

456
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,056
Alex, don't fuck with me!

457
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,057
Dude!

458
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,611
Tony, what the fuck is it...

459
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,213
Okay, let's get out of here.

460
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:46,927
Yeah.

461
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,031
Okay.

462
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:52,347
So if you do a search anywhere,

463
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,142
Google, Reddit, whatever,

464
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:57,938
you find a plethora of
unexplained photos and videos.

465
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,595
Most of them really
into the hotel

466
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,873
or the town itself.

467
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:04,152
Hell House was not
the first incident

468
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:05,912
to happen in this town,

469
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,845
only the most popular.

470
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,641
There are some
disappearances related to

471
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:12,781
an early 2000 County Fair.

472
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,095
That raises some red
flags for me now.

473
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:18,511
The Billy Braddock story
alone is unsettling.

474
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:21,272
It's Louie for the five o'clock.

475
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,204
- Hey.
- Hey.

476
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:23,136
I have to show you something

477
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,964
before we have a meeting.

478
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:25,690
Sure, sure.

479
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,140
I was just updating the journal.

480
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,590
And then remember when Jeff said

481
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:31,006
something about the
whole Abaddon Eyes thing?

482
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,834
- People think they...
- People think they

483
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:33,388
see something, exactly.

484
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:34,527
So my camera,

485
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:36,736
I think it caught something.

486
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:38,978
Oh?

487
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,845
Oh, oh, do I wanna see this?

488
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:43,949
Probably not.

489
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,470
Awesome, okay.

490
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:15,014
Hello?

491
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:17,983
Guys?

492
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:21,850
Where are you?

493
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:25,888
Jesus Christ!

494
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,614
Grab!

495
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:29,029
- Come on, guys.
- Whoa.

496
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,272
That's fucked up.

497
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,801
- I know, you looked so sad.
- Why me?

498
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,033
It's sexist, that's sexism.

499
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,242
It's sexism, what?

500
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:36,175
And Russell would be upset

501
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:37,635
if he knew that you were
playing with these things

502
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,178
and I don't,

503
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:40,707
if he asks, I don't
have a part of that.

504
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:41,835
I'm not part of that.

505
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,389
- Okay.
- Well, you were on camera.

506
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:44,321
Just so you know.

507
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,460
It's worth it.

508
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:46,392
Well, do you think that's what

509
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,634
Vanessa gave us cameras for?

510
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:48,956
- They handed them out.
- I don't think that's

511
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,498
- what she had in mind.
- They handed them out.

512
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:50,775
Bye, mom.

513
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,132
I think Vanessa should thank us,

514
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:53,720
because there would be
no footage otherwise.

515
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:54,607
Yeah, that's true,

516
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,929
otherwise we'd have to listen to

517
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,851
Gregory go on and
on about his craft.

518
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,853
That would be
good television, my friend.

519
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,236
What else?

520
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:05,307
Let's see.

521
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,550
Your bank called again.

522
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:07,758
Which one?

523
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:08,861
All of them.

524
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:09,656
Damn.

525
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,899
Is something going on?

526
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,003
Like what?

527
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:13,867
I don't know, Russ.

528
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:15,110
I've only got one bank,

529
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,319
if they called,
I'd be concerned.

530
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:19,735
Oh, Isabel, she asked
me a weird question.

531
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,943
What's that?

532
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:22,231
She asked if she
would still get her pay

533
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,014
if she had to quit
for some reason?

534
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:24,188
No.

535
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:24,982
Is she thinking about quitting?

536
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:26,225
I don't think so.

537
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:28,434
Like I said, it was
a weird question.

538
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:29,711
Huh.

539
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,575
Alright, I'm
off to wardrobe then.

540
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:32,507
Jane hates her dress as much

541
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,785
as I hate old Jeff's budget.

542
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,027
Yeah.

543
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:36,856
Both of them are cheap.

544
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,822
See you later, Harvey.

545
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:39,755
Bye, honey.

546
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:45,865
This, Father Paulis
dropped this off for you.

547
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,418
Thanks.

548
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:48,671
Can I ask you about the hotel

549
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,041
reopening in a few weeks?

550
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,457
How do you feel about that?

551
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,253
I told Russell, it's a mistake.

552
00:20:54,356 --> 00:20:56,496
And what did he say?

553
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,704
He hired me.

554
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,018
Huh.

555
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:02,121
Good.

556
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:05,540
Something I should know?

557
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:08,301
No, it's private.

558
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:09,751
Okay.

559
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:12,340
How do you know that guy?

560
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:13,962
He's an old friend.

561
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,448
Many demons claim to be
the souls of real people

562
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:18,725
that once wandered the earth

563
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,382
thousands of years ago.

564
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:22,798
Even during the time of Christ.

565
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:25,111
They try and use their
memories of events

566
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:28,217
to sow doubt into believers.

567
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,875
One demon that we've
encountered here in Abaddon,

568
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:35,155
has said over and over,
"Est Aperta Porta."

569
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,609
Wait, what is that?

570
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,957
It's Latin, I think.

571
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,341
What does it mean, do you know?

572
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:47,478
The gate is open.

573
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,342
That's right.

574
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:50,699
Father, can I ask if you've ever

575
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:53,346
heard of Andrew Tully?

576
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,037
Mm-hmm, I have.

577
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,661
And Tully believed
that he found this gateway

578
00:21:57,764 --> 00:21:58,764
and the gateway to hell.

579
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:00,847
We are servants of the snake

580
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,355
and we will release someone

581
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,046
into the lake of fire.

582
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,982
The church is rich

583
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:12,123
with references
to hell and Satan.

584
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,470
There are some old texts

585
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:16,231
that refer to an
earthly gateway to hell

586
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,337
and the demon, Abaddon,
being the guard

587
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,166
and it's been said that

588
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,444
no man can close this
gate once opened.

589
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:25,309
It would take an angel
from God himself.

590
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,449
But if that gate is open,

591
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,556
literal hell could be
unleashed on earth.

592
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,592
And there's also some
versions of the bible

593
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,594
that dismiss all
this as metaphorical.

594
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:38,909
So there's really no stance
that the church holds.

595
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:41,118
Are you bringing people
all the way out here?

596
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:42,982
No, I just needed some air.

597
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:44,397
And it might be the only time

598
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:47,987
we get a chance
to chat today, so.

599
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,576
You lowered ticket prices 30%,

600
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,957
are you expecting
a drop in revenue?

601
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:54,649
That was Jeff's idea.

602
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:56,651
He didn't think that
people would pay full price

603
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,411
to come all the way out here.

604
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,827
So we decreased it to
increase ticket sales.

605
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:02,933
Personally, I think
people pay whatever I say

606
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,313
and we'll still sell out,

607
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,556
because it's a great show.

608
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,980
I think you're right about that.

609
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,938
People will pay to see the show

610
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,974
in this godforsaken hotel.

611
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:11,597
Why do you say that?

612
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,770
Say what?

613
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,047
Godforsaken.

614
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,533
Did you mean it literally or

615
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,338
- some expression?
- Does anyone ever use that

616
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,019
term literally?

617
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:22,228
I mean, I don't
even believe in God.

618
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:24,161
Neither did I.

619
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:25,264
And then?

620
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,337
Don't tell me you're
born again or something?

621
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:31,306
That would be a nice
twist on the story.

622
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,066
Not like you're thinking.

623
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,793
Did Hell House come out here?

624
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:40,211
No, it was the County Fair
grounds in the early 2000s.

625
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:43,249
And so they had the
fair grounds over there.

626
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:52,672
And they used the cornfields

627
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:56,124
behind the Abaddon
Hotel as a hayride.

628
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,402
But they closed it down once
some people got injured.

629
00:23:58,506 --> 00:23:59,955
So this is where that happened?

630
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,509
Yeah.

631
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:02,924
Sad.

632
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,236
And a few years after that,

633
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,859
Hell House comes to town.

634
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:07,791
Mm-hmm.

635
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,689
And nine years after that,

636
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:12,416
Russell Wynn comes to town.

637
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,313
I know what you're getting at.

638
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,522
Yeah.

639
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:15,764
Yeah.

640
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,052
Well, you would
think at some point

641
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:19,354
the town would just
stop having events here.

642
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,220
Well, fortunately
it's not up to them.

643
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:24,635
You still haven't told anyone

644
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:27,673
why you moved Insomnia
out here, this year.

645
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:29,088
Can you tell me?

646
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,342
Russ, there's wardrobe drama,

647
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:33,679
I need you inside now, over.

648
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:37,441
Why do you need me in wardrobe?

649
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:40,789
And asked them to do wardrobe.

650
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,722
Very helpful.

651
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:44,517
We'll have to
continue this later.

652
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:46,105
Promise?

653
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,762
As much as I can.

654
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:56,391
It's progress.

655
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,394
Oh, this is weird.

656
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,364
What the hell is that?

657
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:06,159
I don't know.

658
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:07,954
It's funky looking, look.

659
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
On me.

660
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,892
B.D.?

661
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,585
Mm.

662
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:18,688
Leave it.

663
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:25,558
I'll give Russell credit, he

664
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,770
he allowed people to have fun,

665
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:33,186
to enjoy themselves at work.

666
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,535
You know, but he also had rules.

667
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,098
And he didn't want
anyone wandering alone

668
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:40,124
in the hotel after hours.

669
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:42,541
Call it what you will.

670
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,059
Good fortune!

671
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:45,820
Heart, love, or God!

672
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,858
I have no name for
it, feeling is all.

673
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:52,274
The name is sound and smoke.

674
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,450
Sorry.

675
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,385
I don't think I get it.

676
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:03,182
Is he questioning the
existence of Heaven?

677
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:05,909
He's explaining to Gretchen

678
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:09,568
his own doubts about
heaven and hell,

679
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:12,018
as depicted by Christianity,

680
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:14,607
Faust is full of doubts.

681
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:16,229
Do I share those doubts?

682
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,453
Guys, look, if we're gonna

683
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,760
unpack Faust's
views on religion,

684
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,406
I think we should
take a dinner first.

685
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:21,372
- Right.
- Okay.

686
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:22,615
Yeah, yeah.

687
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,342
Should we try and do
this one more, yeah?

688
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:26,525
Yeah, one more take thing.

689
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,259
Hey, seems like
everything's going well.

690
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,416
Yeah, this place
is half the size

691
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,831
of our theater in the city.

692
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:33,281
It's easier to manage.

693
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,800
How's Russell holding up?

694
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:36,940
Mm, I can't get a read.

695
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,668
It's different than New York.

696
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,048
I've never read Faust.

697
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:43,015
No?

698
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,278
No, I don't plan to either.

699
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:47,157
That's a wrap, guys.

700
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,952
Okay, you can do a bonfire,

701
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:51,092
but we want everyone
back at the hotels

702
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,472
by 21:00 sharp.

703
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,924
Harvey will be doing
room by room headcounts.

704
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:56,891
Got it?

705
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,168
- Yes.
- Got it.

706
00:26:58,271 --> 00:26:59,455
If you're gonna
shoot the bonfire,

707
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,308
make sure you get
when Harvey gets drunk

708
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,630
and tries to walk over the fire.

709
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:02,966
Jeff, I only did that twice.

710
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,553
It was my year of saying yes.

711
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,669
Why would you even
bring that up?

712
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:07,004
What is that relevant to

713
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:07,936
- what we're doing right now?
- You were so good.

714
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,662
You were so close last time.

715
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:12,491
Oh, God.

716
00:27:15,772 --> 00:27:17,187
That's funny.

717
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,606
Guys, everybody's gone.

718
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,470
So you gonna do it?

719
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:27,024
I mean, yeah, for 500 bucks!

720
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,200
Show me that money,
I'm going in there.

721
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:31,580
Are you?

722
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,306
I'm not going
into that basement.

723
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,620
Cool, so Greg's a pussy.

724
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,587
Wait, you said you
need 500 to do it,

725
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,106
you don't sound that brave.

726
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,497
I need some kind of
compensation for my work.

727
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:42,591
Why?

728
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,707
It's just fucked
up to run in there

729
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,698
in the fucking dark on a dare.

730
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:46,941
Mm-hmm.

731
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:49,288
Yeah, because you
saw a scary movie?

732
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:50,565
Yeah.

733
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,431
And 'cause Russell
and Jeff will kill me.

734
00:27:54,534 --> 00:27:55,259
True.

735
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:56,363
Fuck it.

736
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:58,607
I'll do it.

737
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:01,403
For real?

738
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:04,372
So, you go basement and back,

739
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,859
same stakes, free drinks on me.

740
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:10,998
Done.

741
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:13,276
If Russell finds out...

742
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,763
Are you gonna tell him?

743
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:19,732
Are any of you gonna tell him?

744
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:20,871
- So we're good?
- No.

745
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,114
We're good.

746
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:22,977
Let's do it.

747
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,978
Let's go.

748
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:25,945
- Do it, do it, do it.
- Woo!

749
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:28,085
Do it, do it.

750
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,881
So I just.

751
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:32,687
I just got to go and touch
the clown on the nose

752
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,747
on camera and come back?

753
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:36,818
I don't have to
make out with it?

754
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,786
I mean, if you do,

755
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:39,889
I wanna watch that tape.

756
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:42,824
Here.

757
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:46,966
Be quick, please.

758
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,451
Peace out, motherfuckers.

759
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:52,213
Ooh, you have a good time.

760
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:57,080
See y'all
bitches on the flip side.

761
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,227
Hmm, maybe I'll have a little,

762
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,092
a little bev first.

763
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:17,238
I got to pee!

764
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:20,619
Hello.

765
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:29,801
Razzmatazz.

766
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,500
Ladies, pleasure.

767
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:58,037
That's not cool, guys.

768
00:29:58,141 --> 00:29:59,452
I know it's you.

769
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:43,288
Bartender!

770
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:45,463
Fix me a drink.

771
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:54,403
Okay.

772
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:57,889
Cool.

773
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,413
Alright, I'm entering
the basement.

774
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:05,518
Peace out, motherfuckers.

775
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,075
Okay, cool.

776
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:17,151
Entering the basement.

777
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:42,970
What's up, guys?

778
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,422
Oh, nice clowns, Hell House.

779
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:49,528
Looking good.

780
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,430
Damn, bruh.

781
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,124
Looking a little rough.

782
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:06,096
Alright, dick wads.

783
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:10,756
Check this out.

784
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:13,517
I'm gonna give you
guys a little bonus.

785
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:23,700
Alright, that's about as
raunchy as I'm gonna get.

786
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,230
Oh, shit.

787
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,288
Oh my God.

788
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:03,463
Oh my God.

789
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:05,499
Fuck.

790
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,610
Oh my God.

791
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:31,388
Are you okay?

792
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:32,907
Shit, fuck.

793
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,874
What the fuck happened to you?

794
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:36,876
Are you okay?

795
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,913
What the fuck was she thinking?

796
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,364
You heard me, I
said nobody inside

797
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:42,779
after we wrap.

798
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:44,091
You said it, I said it,

799
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:45,333
even Harvey said it.

800
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:46,231
She must've had
too much to drink

801
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,715
and just got stupid.

802
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,512
Look, she didn't even
show up on set today either.

803
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,343
I'll talk to her.

804
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:56,655
I checked her camera.

805
00:33:56,758 --> 00:33:58,105
She's telling the truth.

806
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,554
She did see that clown.

807
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:01,073
Goddammit.

808
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:02,395
You got to make sure
they're not playing pranks

809
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:03,144
on each other anymore
around this place.

810
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:04,352
I will, I will,

811
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:05,674
I'll keep a tighter
leash on them.

812
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:06,251
Make sure they
know it's serious.

813
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:06,906
I said I will.

814
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,838
Okay.

815
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:08,839
We got to get on the same page.

816
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:10,151
Mm-hmm.

817
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:11,877
We agree that maybe
she saw something.

818
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
Yeah.

819
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,983
But we float the idea

820
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,478
that maybe it was
someone messing with her.

821
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:17,607
One of the pranks,

822
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,401
because people have
been pranking each other

823
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:19,816
since we got here.

824
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,231
If we get ahead of it,

825
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,130
then we can stop
them speculating,

826
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:25,511
or God forbid, tweet about it.

827
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:28,273
This conversation doesn't air.

828
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:29,136
Yes?

829
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,964
Yes.

830
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:30,792
Good.

831
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:32,242
I know Jane.

832
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,486
And she does not break easy.

833
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:37,420
Russell thinks one of
us fucked with her, but

834
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:39,387
I know I didn't.

835
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,804
There's just a lot of
weird shit going on.

836
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:43,598
How does that make you feel

837
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:45,600
coming into work today?

838
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:48,672
What am I gonna do?

839
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:49,949
The man's paying us better

840
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:52,987
than any other gig I
could possibly get.

841
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,713
Why do you
think Russell's doing that?

842
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:57,474
Paying everyone more to be here?

843
00:34:58,682 --> 00:34:59,763
I've only known him
for like five years.

844
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:01,789
But I think he's changed

845
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,586
since the crash.

846
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:09,072
The car crash in 2008?

847
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:12,075
Yeah.

848
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:14,457
He's lucky to be alive.

849
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,044
Put it that way.

850
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:20,152
The rumor is that they
were actually about to

851
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:21,256
call it.

852
00:35:22,258 --> 00:35:23,086
What do you think that has to do

853
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,536
with him leaving the city?

854
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,471
Can massive head
trauma lead people to do

855
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:29,989
some crazy stuff?

856
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:33,131
Maybe.

857
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,384
Do you know if
we're just supposed to

858
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,824
like, continuously
film with these things?

859
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,136
Mine's already full.

860
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,690
She didn't really say anything.

861
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:42,933
Well, your camera's pretty nice.

862
00:35:43,037 --> 00:35:46,765
I mean, maybe you should
try to take it home.

863
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:51,218
Are you all right, Isabel?

864
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:52,184
Yeah, what's going on with you?

865
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:53,081
You're very quiet today.

866
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,185
I'm fine.

867
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:56,637
You sure?

868
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
I'm fine.

869
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,099
What do you
think happened to Jane?

870
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:00,882
Only person that
could pull off a prank

871
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:02,781
like that, is me.

872
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:05,956
And I was with you
the whole time, so.

873
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:08,061
Were you?

874
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,271
Yeah, I think so.

875
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,169
Either way, I didn't do it,

876
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,412
so doesn't matter.

877
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:15,897
If I had seen that clown,

878
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:18,590
I would've pooped in my panties.

879
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:19,867
She really did see it, then.

880
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,558
Credit to her for
sticking around.

881
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:23,250
She's tough for a girl.

882
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:24,216
Oh, fuck you, Gregory.

883
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,597
All woman are tougher than you.

884
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,115
Please.

885
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:30,533
Hey baby girl,
are you with the boys?

886
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:32,707
I'm just finishing
up their makeup.

887
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:34,330
You guys ready downstairs?

888
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,652
So once you're done turning them

889
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:36,676
from drab to fab,

890
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,989
send them my way, please, out.

891
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:40,439
Copy.

892
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:42,234
Get into character, barkeep.

893
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:43,546
Want shots?

894
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:44,649
Yes.

895
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:49,379
Putting this over
here for you, okay?

896
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:28,418
Hello?

897
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:30,764
Fuck.

898
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,251
Fuck.

899
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:38,496
Okay.

900
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:46,953
Fuck.

901
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:52,993
Hello?

902
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:07,145
Jane?

903
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:09,113
Jane!

904
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:13,118
Jane, really?

905
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,085
Come on.

906
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:17,398
Jane, this is so fucked up.

907
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,900
I thought more money would help.

908
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:38,488
It worked on Jane.

909
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:41,457
Goddammit.

910
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,251
Now we have to rehire.

911
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,668
So close to opening, too.

912
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:48,015
What did you offer her to stay?

913
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,397
Double pay, same as Jane.

914
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,846
That better not leave this room.

915
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,296
Look, I've got some calls out,

916
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,101
I'm sure we'll have the
department filled by tomorrow.

917
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,852
Just make sure you stay
quiet about why she left.

918
00:38:57,956 --> 00:38:59,382
Of course, but what are
we gonna inevitably say

919
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:00,566
when the others start asking?

920
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:02,201
You know this cast
is gossipy as hell.

921
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,582
Could be she just

922
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:05,826
burned out, got too tired.

923
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,068
People get tired, right?

924
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:08,652
Jeff, I have known
Isabel for years.

925
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:09,909
We're not gonna go around saying

926
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,419
she's too tired
to do a gig, okay?

927
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:13,351
Look, I know I'm a
bit over the top,

928
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:14,593
but listen to me.

929
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:16,699
Something is wrong here.

930
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,563
You know it, we know it,

931
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:19,805
everybody knows it.

932
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:21,127
And we're just plowing
through the day

933
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,232
like everything's
perfectly fine.

934
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:24,292
But it's starting to feel like,

935
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,536
I mean, nevermind, it's...

936
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,607
Go on.

937
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:31,897
It's starting
to feel like Hell House.

938
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:32,611
And they didn't listen
to the warning signs,

939
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:33,888
did they, Russell?

940
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:36,270
I'm telling you, we
have to call it off right now.

941
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,513
You were there!

942
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:39,066
I mean you saw what
fucking happened!

943
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,517
And now you're gonna make
a fucking joke, right now.

944
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,865
To Alex, your fucking best bud.

945
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,625
Fuck you, man.

946
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:48,869
This is nothing like Hell House.

947
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,630
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

948
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:53,574
Don't tell me you're jumping
on the bus with Isabel?

949
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:54,816
No, that's not what
I'm saying, Russell.

950
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,152
What I'm saying is

951
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:57,647
I've personally recruited
people to be here,

952
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:59,027
and I feel like something
bad is gonna happen.

953
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:00,156
And if that happens,

954
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:02,434
that's on me and I
can't handle that, okay?

955
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:04,194
It won't.

956
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:06,058
If we all do our
jobs, including me,

957
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:08,992
I promise you, this
is gonna work out.

958
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:11,063
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

959
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,169
But just, talking about Isabel,

960
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:14,135
we got her camera back

961
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,517
but the card is missing.

962
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:18,105
You guys know
anything about that?

963
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,624
What card?

964
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,256
The memory card
that goes in the camera.

965
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,972
We can't get any of
the footage off of it.

966
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:24,767
Ah, shit, we better find that.

967
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:28,702
Don't look at me.

968
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,059
So I've been tasked
with turning this

969
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,223
shit show of a hotel
into a functioning set.

970
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:35,743
This has been the least
enjoyable project I've worked on,

971
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:38,332
and I have done children's
theater in Alabama.

972
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,783
With Isabel's sudden departure,

973
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:42,647
how's everyone's
mood here on set?

974
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,442
I mean, it was
unfortunate to lose Isy.

975
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:46,547
We've had a few hiccups
as any production would.

976
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,411
You know, I wanna make
it explicitly clear

977
00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:50,009
that nothing was wrong
with Isy's performance,

978
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,828
she's great, she
just had to leave.

979
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,461
Isy, baby girl, if
you're watching this,

980
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,935
we miss you.

981
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,395
I'm gonna see you in New
York, we'll have a drink.

982
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:57,903
Love you.

983
00:40:58,007 --> 00:40:59,905
When Isabel left the
production suddenly,

984
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:01,148
it really wasn't a surprise

985
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,081
if you look back at her
social media history

986
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:04,669
while she was there.

987
00:41:04,772 --> 00:41:05,991
I mean she was taking
a lot of selfies

988
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:07,637
and posting them on Facebook

989
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:09,777
or Instagram or whatever.

990
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,505
If you read the
comments carefully,

991
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:16,646
some people started to point
out things in the background.

992
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,934
I mean, if you look
at the pictures,

993
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,236
you can see there's
something there.

994
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:30,963
That's a fucking mannequin...

995
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:39,358
You good?

996
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:41,153
Just don't shit your
pants like last time.

997
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:51,301
Alex!

998
00:41:51,405 --> 00:41:52,405
Alex, hold on!

999
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:01,760
What's wrong with it?

1000
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:04,936
The zoom lens isn't focusing.

1001
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:07,145
What does that mean?

1002
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:10,182
It's working, it's just
being a little wonky.

1003
00:42:10,286 --> 00:42:12,322
Can you fix it?

1004
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:13,427
Yeah.

1005
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,394
Let me grab my bag from the car.

1006
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:16,682
You know, they're
wrapped for the day,

1007
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:18,063
do you wanna just go
back to the hotel?

1008
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:19,305
Let me just take
care of it here.

1009
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,952
And keep your eye on
the camera for me.

1010
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,055
Sure.

1011
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:22,919
Use it in case anything

1012
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:24,183
weird or interesting happens.

1013
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:25,404
Okay.

1014
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:26,129
It's still recording!

1015
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:27,233
Okay!

1016
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:03,545
Jeff?

1017
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:07,722
Harvey?

1018
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:13,693
Hello?

1019
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,299
Louie, if you're
screwing with me,

1020
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,578
I'm gonna shove this
camera you know where.

1021
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:44,586
Hello?

1022
00:43:54,977 --> 00:43:58,739
So Louie calls me
one afternoon saying,

1023
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:00,983
essentially something
happened to Vanessa.

1024
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:03,364
He wanted to pull her out
and go back to New York.

1025
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:06,333
I said, that was
her call, not his.

1026
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,369
There was no one anywhere
in the hotel, okay?

1027
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:09,761
We cleared out well before the...

1028
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:11,234
She said she
saw something, Jeff.

1029
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:12,891
She's not crazy.

1030
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:14,203
Look, I never said she was.

1031
00:44:14,306 --> 00:44:15,411
Well, then explain why

1032
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:16,136
your guys' sets
are malfunctioning.

1033
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,447
Excuse me?

1034
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:18,977
Look, our sets are
not malfunctioning,

1035
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:19,726
she is.

1036
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:21,866
Okay, let's calm down.

1037
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:23,799
And let's just
listen to Vanessa.

1038
00:44:23,902 --> 00:44:26,042
What do you think you saw?

1039
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:29,528
I don't know, it
was really quick.

1040
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:30,672
So maybe it was nothing?

1041
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,394
Mm-hmm.

1042
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:34,223
You know, maybe.

1043
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:35,051
No way.

1044
00:44:35,155 --> 00:44:37,433
- Don't let them bully you.
- Look, I just,

1045
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:38,330
I really wanna forget about
the whole thing, okay?

1046
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:39,538
I'm a little embarrassed.

1047
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:40,367
Vanessa.

1048
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,955
I'm okay, Louie.

1049
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,050
She just freaked
herself out, she's good.

1050
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,756
I could already hear
my male colleagues saying.

1051
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,759
"See? She couldn't handle it."

1052
00:44:52,862 --> 00:44:55,106
Yeah, I wasn't going anywhere.

1053
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:56,911
Look, I just don't wanna
be called difficult

1054
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:59,455
or crazy or all of
the other sexist

1055
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:01,906
shit that men say about
women in the workplace.

1056
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:02,734
I get it.

1057
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:04,011
I mean, Jesus,

1058
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:05,841
I've only had this
job a few months.

1059
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:07,325
Louie, I can't screw it up

1060
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:09,308
because I saw something
that I couldn't explain.

1061
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:10,949
Just, hell no.

1062
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:13,780
Believe me, I get
the situation you're in.

1063
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:15,851
But you and I saw that video.

1064
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:16,817
That was real.

1065
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:19,233
And I got your back on that.

1066
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:23,651
What do you wanna do?

1067
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,727
I wanna talk to Russell.

1068
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:30,969
Okay.

1069
00:45:31,073 --> 00:45:32,429
I think he gets in at
like 08:00 tomorrow?

1070
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:34,352
No, right now.

1071
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:37,976
You wanna
ambush him at his hotel?

1072
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,080
Yeah.

1073
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:40,806
I do.

1074
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:43,820
If Russell thought he was
gonna be the first person

1075
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:46,605
to use the Abaddon and not have

1076
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:49,712
the unusual paranormal
incidents pile up,

1077
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:50,955
he was insane.

1078
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:54,375
And actually, a lot of
people thought he was insane.

1079
00:45:54,475 --> 00:45:56,374
It wasn't just Hell House.

1080
00:45:56,477 --> 00:45:57,616
There are countless people

1081
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,308
who have disappeared
inside that hotel.

1082
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:01,010
The latest being those
poor folks on that.

1083
00:46:01,034 --> 00:46:02,690
"Morning Mysteries" episode.

1084
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:04,278
Last seen at a bar
near the Abaddon

1085
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:05,693
before going missing.

1086
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,592
- Oh, no.
- Coming on the dance floor.

1087
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:08,800
Oh God.

1088
00:46:08,904 --> 00:46:10,226
- Well, it's okay.
- The dance commander.

1089
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,459
There's the Billy
Braddock disappearance.

1090
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,609
He posted on Facebook that
he was going to the Abaddon

1091
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:16,325
to burn it down.

1092
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:17,947
Never heard from again.

1093
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:19,718
Most of these people film
what they were doing,

1094
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:22,607
just like Hell
House and Insomnia.

1095
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,575
Those tapes have
to exist somewhere.

1096
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:36,000
Russell?

1097
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:43,041
What is this?

1098
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,699
What is that?

1099
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,838
I have no idea.

1100
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:48,391
What are you doing?

1101
00:46:48,495 --> 00:46:50,669
Hi, sorry, I was
looking for you actually.

1102
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,533
I wanted to talk
to you if I could.

1103
00:46:52,637 --> 00:46:54,156
- Sorry.
- About what?

1104
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:55,778
About the hotel, Russell.

1105
00:46:55,882 --> 00:46:57,642
I mean what's been
going on there?

1106
00:46:57,745 --> 00:46:59,126
Your people don't feel safe

1107
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,724
and if I could just show you
the video that we shot earlier.

1108
00:47:00,748 --> 00:47:02,028
I don't need to see your video.

1109
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:04,580
I'm sure you saw
something that scared you.

1110
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:06,582
Then why aren't you concerned?

1111
00:47:06,685 --> 00:47:08,929
You're not here
to advise me on my business,

1112
00:47:09,033 --> 00:47:11,483
you're here to
document the opening.

1113
00:47:11,587 --> 00:47:12,702
I'm sorry about what
happened to you.

1114
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:13,451
- Really am.
- Look, forget about

1115
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:14,693
what happened to me,

1116
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:16,834
just talk to your
own people, Russell.

1117
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,146
They don't feel safe there.

1118
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,461
I'll see
you guys at the Abaddon.

1119
00:47:28,673 --> 00:47:30,295
Was that Mitchell Cavanaugh?

1120
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:31,262
Yeah.

1121
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:33,851
The missing Mitchell Cavanaugh.

1122
00:47:37,544 --> 00:47:38,821
I don't know.

1123
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,654
What do you wanna
do in case of rain?

1124
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:46,173
It's one week until we open,

1125
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:49,073
and young Jeffrey starts
to worry about everything,

1126
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:50,350
Murphy's law.

1127
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:51,637
Tell them to being umbrellas,

1128
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,835
they'll be fine.

1129
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:54,261
Alright, we still
running those buses

1130
00:47:54,285 --> 00:47:55,113
out of the city?

1131
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:56,435
Only if they agree to the rate

1132
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:58,530
they originally quoted
us, despite demand.

1133
00:47:58,634 --> 00:47:59,634
Agree?

1134
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:00,912
Yeah, okay.

1135
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:02,845
You know, everyone's
doing all right.

1136
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,571
Everybody's in great spirits.

1137
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,160
It's like no one notices
Isabel ran back to the city.

1138
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:07,988
I don't know how.

1139
00:48:08,092 --> 00:48:09,231
They noticed.

1140
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:10,553
But you and Harvey have
been doing a good job

1141
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:13,304
helping to keep
everyone focused.

1142
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:14,857
Thanks.

1143
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:15,961
Yeah.

1144
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:17,895
It's not easy.

1145
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:20,275
This place.

1146
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:23,176
Jeff?

1147
00:48:24,798 --> 00:48:27,318
Yeah, go ahead,
Harvey, I'm here, over.

1148
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:28,595
I'm upstairs,

1149
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:29,883
are we good to go
on the light test?

1150
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,631
We good?

1151
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:31,460
Yeah.

1152
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:32,702
Yeah, good to go.

1153
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:35,533
Russ and I will be
there in a bit, over.

1154
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:37,949
Wonderful, over and out.

1155
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:39,192
We'll get it.

1156
00:48:39,295 --> 00:48:40,295
Okay.

1157
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,471
See you in there.

1158
00:48:48,304 --> 00:48:49,695
Mark, we're gonna start
doing the lighting test

1159
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,145
on the second floor
whenever you're ready.

1160
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:52,722
I'm in the bedroom.

1161
00:48:53,585 --> 00:48:55,415
Copy that.

1162
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:58,694
Alright, bring everything
down to full dark, please.

1163
00:49:01,317 --> 00:49:02,501
Ain't got time to be doing this,

1164
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:05,839
I had a million
things to do today.

1165
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,325
Alright, give me the
dust lamp, please, on.

1166
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:12,777
Okay, off on that.

1167
00:49:16,194 --> 00:49:19,335
Alright, give me the
red lamp, please.

1168
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:23,512
Oh God, that looks so good.

1169
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:25,893
It'd be even better
if we had two.

1170
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,930
Ugh, we really
could've used two.

1171
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:30,415
Off on the red lamp.

1172
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:32,659
Jeff said we can
only afford one lamp.

1173
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,075
Jeff says stop
flirting with Louie.

1174
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:38,285
Jeff says the things
that make me sick.

1175
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:39,666
What a guy, that Jeff.

1176
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:40,770
What the f...

1177
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,153
Lights up, lights up.

1178
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:48,537
Hey, are you okay?

1179
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:50,884
Yeah, I'm okay.

1180
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,230
Let's go again.

1181
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,970
Come on, Jeff, give me some
of that money for the lights.

1182
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,409
It's looking a
little drab in here.

1183
00:49:58,512 --> 00:49:59,341
Looks like dinner theater.

1184
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:00,894
I don't do dinner theater.

1185
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,389
Let's figure out a way to
move a few of these bottles,

1186
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:03,759
then we'll talk.

1187
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:05,302
What, you
mean this great backwash?

1188
00:50:07,418 --> 00:50:08,833
No, I wish.

1189
00:50:08,936 --> 00:50:11,870
I actually haven't been back
to New York in nine years.

1190
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:13,803
Sounds like Gregory
met his first fan.

1191
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:16,427
Girl actually likes him.

1192
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,292
Confident, a little conceited.

1193
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:20,707
I really like that.

1194
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,330
Well, thanks.

1195
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:25,091
You're welcome.

1196
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:27,196
We'll enjoy you.

1197
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,197
What the hell does that mean?

1198
00:50:28,301 --> 00:50:29,854
I hope you will.

1199
00:50:29,957 --> 00:50:32,443
Honestly, I'm done here.

1200
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:33,651
You can say that again.

1201
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:34,617
That's nice.

1202
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:37,517
But you're never leaving here.

1203
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,001
You know that, right?

1204
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:40,658
What do you mean?

1205
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:42,660
Because, silly.

1206
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:44,179
He's coming.

1207
00:50:44,282 --> 00:50:46,284
And you're all going to hell.

1208
00:50:46,388 --> 00:50:48,735
- Hey, Gregory, we...
- Oh, hey, Jeff.

1209
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:51,151
I was just talking to...
Where did she go?

1210
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:52,255
What the.

1211
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,018
Who were you talking to?

1212
00:50:56,122 --> 00:50:57,133
I don't know, she
didn't say her name.

1213
00:50:57,157 --> 00:50:59,332
She, uh, did you see her?

1214
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:01,644
Nobody's here.

1215
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:02,852
What are you talking about?

1216
00:51:02,956 --> 00:51:04,682
She was right here, dude.

1217
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:05,648
Right here?

1218
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:07,512
Two seconds ago.

1219
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:08,341
Where did she go?

1220
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:09,894
Was she...

1221
00:51:09,997 --> 00:51:10,688
Yeah, you have
an imaginary girlfriend now?

1222
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:11,791
No.

1223
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:14,243
She sounded cute though,

1224
00:51:14,347 --> 00:51:16,003
which is a stretch for you.

1225
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:18,178
What did she look like?

1226
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:20,629
She had like dark blonde hair

1227
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:22,872
and she was wearing a
gray T-shirt, jeans.

1228
00:51:22,976 --> 00:51:24,840
I don't know, did
she go past you guys?

1229
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:26,083
No.

1230
00:51:29,638 --> 00:51:31,778
She was like right here.

1231
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:34,608
It was really strange.

1232
00:51:34,712 --> 00:51:37,094
The way she sounded.

1233
00:51:37,197 --> 00:51:38,854
What she was saying.

1234
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:51,211
And no one has seen her
around the hotel since?

1235
00:51:51,315 --> 00:51:52,315
No.

1236
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,078
Definitely didn't get a name?

1237
00:51:56,182 --> 00:51:57,182
No name.

1238
00:51:58,874 --> 00:52:01,394
But the way he described her...

1239
00:52:02,774 --> 00:52:04,983
What is it?

1240
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:11,093
Sounded like,
sounded like Sara Havel.

1241
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:27,040
I think Russell
had his enablers.

1242
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,697
He was a lot like
Alex Taylor too.

1243
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,182
People around him letting
him get away with things.

1244
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:32,597
Never questioning him.

1245
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:34,979
I think that's how Hell
House met its demise.

1246
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:38,741
And so, too, Insomnia,
nine years later.

1247
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:43,056
Russell knew what he
was doing the whole time.

1248
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,266
That's what I think people
should know the most.

1249
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,578
And I think that's where the

1250
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:50,374
Alex and Russell
comparisons end.

1251
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:55,896
Russell knew what was
coming opening night.

1252
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
He knew it.

1253
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:01,661
When everybody got together
the night before opening,

1254
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:04,422
it was like nothing
had happened.

1255
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:11,049
I think that's the
brilliance of Russell Wynn.

1256
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:16,089
He created such a
comfortable atmosphere,

1257
00:53:17,642 --> 00:53:19,126
when there was just no right

1258
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,612
for anyone to feel comfortable.

1259
00:53:21,715 --> 00:53:22,889
So Vanessa,

1260
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,409
how single would
you say Louie is?

1261
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:27,732
- Why are you asking?
- So what is the plan?

1262
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:29,896
To be a big time news anchor or?

1263
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,656
She already is a
big time news anchor.

1264
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,968
Oh no.

1265
00:53:33,071 --> 00:53:34,428
Tell me, in your
luxurious career,

1266
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:35,142
have you ever interviewed
anyone as uptight

1267
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:36,385
as old Jeff here?

1268
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:37,604
Anyone else give
you the Jeff face?

1269
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:39,319
He might be the most uptight.

1270
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:41,114
That's not the face he makes.

1271
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:41,942
Ah.

1272
00:53:42,046 --> 00:53:45,394
- Responsible and...
- Oh, well, well, well.

1273
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:47,603
Look who's so late.

1274
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,398
- Hey.
- What's up?

1275
00:53:49,502 --> 00:53:51,676
Good to see you, all right!

1276
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,505
Oh, there's no room?

1277
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:53,437
I'll just, I should go?

1278
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,540
Oh.

1279
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:57,786
Ah, did I miss dinner?

1280
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:00,064
By about 30 minutes, yeah.

1281
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:01,167
What?

1282
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:04,310
Hi, Mr. Wynn.

1283
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:05,242
Hello.

1284
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:06,173
What can I get for you?

1285
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:07,347
How about a menu?

1286
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:08,555
I'm actually sorry,

1287
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:10,868
our kitchen closed
about 30 minutes ago.

1288
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:12,110
It's 22:30.

1289
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:13,353
I mean, I can go back there

1290
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:14,813
and see if our chef will
whip you up something?

1291
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:16,494
No, no, it's fine.

1292
00:54:18,979 --> 00:54:20,464
Can I just have
some dinner rolls

1293
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:21,396
and a glass of red?

1294
00:54:21,499 --> 00:54:22,328
Yeah, sure!

1295
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:24,537
What kind of wine you want?

1296
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,609
Château Latour,
mid 80s preferably.

1297
00:54:27,712 --> 00:54:29,369
Maybe '91, if you have it?

1298
00:54:29,473 --> 00:54:32,752
I don't think we have
any Château anything.

1299
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:34,754
Oh, we do have
Wynn Merlot though?

1300
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:36,894
No, no, way overpriced.

1301
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:39,793
Just the house red's good.

1302
00:54:39,897 --> 00:54:41,588
Sure, be right back with that.

1303
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:45,178
Russell Wynn.

1304
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,110
Mm-hmm.

1305
00:54:46,213 --> 00:54:47,333
Public amongst the people,

1306
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:49,078
what should we
attribute this to?

1307
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:50,804
Well, it's the last
night of normalcy,

1308
00:54:50,908 --> 00:54:52,841
so I wanna be with my people,

1309
00:54:52,944 --> 00:54:56,534
because after tomorrow,
it's gonna be hell.

1310
00:54:56,638 --> 00:54:57,432
Here you are, Mr. Wynn.

1311
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,226
Cheers, cheers.

1312
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,745
Nobody wants that, right?

1313
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:02,747
- Hey!
- Thanks, bud.

1314
00:55:02,851 --> 00:55:03,886
Wow, okay.

1315
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:06,372
Did anybody eat?

1316
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,065
So, Jeff told me that you guys

1317
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:12,550
are officially sold
out for the first week.

1318
00:55:12,654 --> 00:55:13,931
How's that make you feel?

1319
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:15,277
Thank you for that question.

1320
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:16,485
You're in interview mode.

1321
00:55:18,073 --> 00:55:20,109
Well, why can't you just relax?

1322
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:22,560
And socialize like
a normal person?

1323
00:55:22,664 --> 00:55:24,217
That was normal socializing.

1324
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,908
That was normal conversation.

1325
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:27,324
Totally, okay.

1326
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,638
That is a very good
question, Vanessa.

1327
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:33,640
And I'm glad that you asked it,

1328
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:35,884
because we are so excited
here for Insomnia.

1329
00:55:35,987 --> 00:55:37,920
The colonel is ready,

1330
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:40,233
and we'll see you tomorrow.

1331
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:44,755
But seriously, I don't think
you should come tomorrow night.

1332
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:46,343
What?

1333
00:55:46,446 --> 00:55:47,309
Why wouldn't we come?

1334
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:50,933
I don't,
you said that me Louie can come,

1335
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:51,796
that's part of the plan,

1336
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,039
I don't understand.

1337
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:54,154
Yeah, but you could
film the dress rehearsal

1338
00:55:54,178 --> 00:55:56,111
and have the same effect.

1339
00:55:56,214 --> 00:55:57,374
What are you talking about?

1340
00:55:57,423 --> 00:55:59,528
You said that Louie
and I have full access.

1341
00:55:59,632 --> 00:56:02,013
Sure, but I think you
should pick another night.

1342
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:05,776
Russell, what is going on?

1343
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:06,879
Nothing.

1344
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:08,779
Really, nothing?

1345
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:09,607
- Mm-hmm.
- You expect me to

1346
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:10,781
believe that?

1347
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:14,750
So, can I get
anything else for you?

1348
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:16,107
No, I think I'm gonna go to bed.

1349
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:18,651
Just give the checks
to this guy right here.

1350
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:19,754
He'll take care of it.

1351
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,688
I'll take care of it.

1352
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:26,728
♪ Running away ♪
Because I'm running away

1353
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:29,316
♪ On another day Take care.

1354
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,766
Alright, goodnight everyone.

1355
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,698
Night, Russ.

1356
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:33,251
Sleep well.

1357
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:35,012
You guys be ready for tomorrow.

1358
00:56:35,115 --> 00:56:35,840
Maybe.

1359
00:56:35,944 --> 00:56:36,944
Always.

1360
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:42,640
Hey, hey!

1361
00:56:42,744 --> 00:56:43,744
Russell.

1362
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:46,575
What's going on?

1363
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,233
You really wanna know?

1364
00:56:49,336 --> 00:56:50,336
Yeah.

1365
00:57:23,025 --> 00:57:25,442
We have to go talk to
Father Paulis again.

1366
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:27,720
I think he knows something.

1367
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:28,823
Everything.

1368
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,346
So,

1369
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:38,316
do you wanna tell me
what Russell said to you?

1370
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:42,251
Vanessa, what are we doing here?

1371
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:45,151
Come on, Vanessa.

1372
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,083
Like, open up,

1373
00:57:46,186 --> 00:57:48,741
like, tell me something, please.

1374
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:52,986
- Okay.
- Hey, come on.

1375
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:53,953
- Come on.
- Jesus Christ.

1376
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:55,056
Let's go.

1377
00:57:57,163 --> 00:57:58,336
Father Paulis.

1378
00:58:00,028 --> 00:58:01,098
Hello, Miss Shepherd.

1379
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:02,513
Can we talk to you?

1380
00:58:02,617 --> 00:58:03,897
I'm sorry, I'm very busy today,

1381
00:58:03,963 --> 00:58:05,447
I don't have time.

1382
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:06,379
Father, I know that you're

1383
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,484
not telling me everything

1384
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:09,796
about your relationship
with Russell.

1385
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,453
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1386
00:58:11,557 --> 00:58:15,906
Are you receiving
any money from Russell?

1387
00:58:32,163 --> 00:58:33,579
Money?

1388
00:58:33,682 --> 00:58:35,512
Yes, cash.

1389
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:38,655
I can't shake this feeling that.

1390
00:58:38,756 --> 00:58:40,724
Russell's having some
banking issues right now

1391
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:41,907
and that has to do with him

1392
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:44,590
moving around large
sums of money.

1393
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,493
He might be.

1394
00:58:52,977 --> 00:58:56,256
Do you know what
he's doing with this money?

1395
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,087
I really don't think I can say.

1396
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:03,712
Okay, Louie, come on.

1397
00:59:03,816 --> 00:59:06,335
Father, this is off the record.

1398
00:59:07,716 --> 00:59:10,029
This is too big to be
between just you and Russell.

1399
00:59:11,996 --> 00:59:15,828
Father, you said that you
know that Andrew Tully was

1400
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:17,554
searching for this
fabled gateway to hell

1401
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:20,246
in this town over 30 years ago.

1402
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:23,111
What if he found it?

1403
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:25,216
What if he found the gateway?

1404
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,253
And he achieved what
he had always wanted,

1405
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:31,326
which was to cross to the
other side and come back?

1406
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:33,742
And Russell is having
hundreds of people

1407
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:36,434
go through there later tonight.

1408
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:40,483
You know,
Russell's a very troubled soul,

1409
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:41,507
he, uh,

1410
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:48,792
he's carrying a large
burden with him.

1411
00:59:48,895 --> 00:59:52,381
And that's making him do what?

1412
00:59:55,246 --> 00:59:57,663
As of tonight at midnight,

1413
00:59:57,766 --> 00:59:59,941
he's liquidating
all of his assets

1414
01:00:00,044 --> 01:00:02,909
and he's instructed
me to disperse them

1415
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:04,808
to suitable charities.

1416
01:00:10,503 --> 01:00:12,332
Thank you.

1417
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:19,028
Holy shit.

1418
01:00:20,962 --> 01:00:23,930
What does that mean?

1419
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:28,348
I think that means
it's it for Russell tonight.

1420
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:29,936
She drops this bombshell story

1421
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,731
on New York Eight's website.

1422
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:33,802
Breaks all kinds of
journalistic rules.

1423
01:00:34,872 --> 01:00:36,978
It goes national within an hour.

1424
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:41,120
If she's wrong, she would've
been fired that day.

1425
01:00:41,223 --> 01:00:43,191
Turns out she was right.

1426
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:46,297
Did you tell
him it was off the record?

1427
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:47,401
I did.

1428
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:51,199
But I knew that he
was hiding something.

1429
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:52,856
Everybody did.

1430
01:00:52,959 --> 01:00:54,443
You know, I feel
like we came so close

1431
01:00:54,547 --> 01:00:57,895
to getting it shut
down before it opened.

1432
01:00:59,276 --> 01:01:00,346
Imagine that.

1433
01:01:04,384 --> 01:01:05,544
- This is working now.
- Okay.

1434
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:06,752
It wasn't in, don't ask me.

1435
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:09,804
I'm winning this game.

1436
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:11,046
I'm bustard.

1437
01:01:16,845 --> 01:01:18,744
Thing of Insomnia,
just hours away,

1438
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:21,367
at its new location,
the Abaddon Hotel.

1439
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,611
We've just received news
regarding Russell Wynn's finances.

1440
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:27,338
The report, from New York
Eight's Vanessa Shepherd,

1441
01:01:27,442 --> 01:01:29,133
host of "Morning
Mysteries", who has spoken

1442
01:01:29,237 --> 01:01:31,135
to the cast and
crew of Insomnia,

1443
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:34,104
says that Russell Wynn is
planning a complete liquidation

1444
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,002
of all of his assets and wealth,

1445
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:38,108
effective midnight tonight.

1446
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:39,331
What that means for Insomnia

1447
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:41,076
and the rest of his
holdings and IP,

1448
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,180
is still up in the...

1449
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:46,357
Dude, what the fuck?

1450
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:48,014
We're still getting paid, right?

1451
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:50,120
I don't, what is liquidate?

1452
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,086
- Jeff?
- He won't use it that way,

1453
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,053
but it doesn't matter.

1454
01:01:52,156 --> 01:01:53,019
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

1455
01:01:53,123 --> 01:01:54,849
We're probably not getting paid.

1456
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,719
Russell, what is this shit?

1457
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:05,514
What the hell, Russell?

1458
01:02:05,618 --> 01:02:06,446
Father Paulis,

1459
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,828
if you can't trust a priest.

1460
01:02:08,932 --> 01:02:10,761
What is this shit?

1461
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:12,625
Her report's very misleading.

1462
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,454
I'm not liquidating
my IP and the holdings

1463
01:02:14,558 --> 01:02:16,353
that fund projects
like Insomnia.

1464
01:02:16,456 --> 01:02:18,044
Who gives a shit about Insomnia?

1465
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:19,252
This is bullshit!

1466
01:02:19,356 --> 01:02:20,529
This whole venture,

1467
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:21,852
coming out to the
middle of nowhere.

1468
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:23,291
Your shitty wine.

1469
01:02:23,394 --> 01:02:24,395
What else are you hiding?

1470
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:25,949
I'm not hiding anything.

1471
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:27,122
What I do with my money

1472
01:02:27,226 --> 01:02:28,468
is not your concern, Jeffrey.

1473
01:02:28,572 --> 01:02:30,988
I'm the COO of Wynn Media Group.

1474
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,679
Of course it concerns me!

1475
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:34,612
What I do with my money

1476
01:02:34,716 --> 01:02:36,383
- is not your concern!
- Oh, that's just great.

1477
01:02:36,407 --> 01:02:37,581
You know what?

1478
01:02:38,582 --> 01:02:40,687
That's just fucking great.

1479
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:41,861
You done?

1480
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:43,276
We open in two hours.

1481
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,657
Get your shit together,

1482
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,314
and let's have an awesome show.

1483
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:47,532
Wait a minute, so
we're still open, right?

1484
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:48,419
We're opening tonight?

1485
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:49,523
Yes!

1486
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:50,628
Okay, okay.

1487
01:02:52,078 --> 01:02:53,908
Let's get outta here.

1488
01:02:54,011 --> 01:02:56,013
Let's get everything ready.

1489
01:02:56,117 --> 01:02:57,117
I have no idea.

1490
01:02:59,706 --> 01:03:00,706
Nice try.

1491
01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:11,857
He was never gonna be able
to keep that story a secret.

1492
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,375
But looking back,

1493
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:15,757
it makes sense.

1494
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:18,484
The tapes I found

1495
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:20,866
the most interesting
were the unseen footage

1496
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:22,246
shot by Hell House.

1497
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,974
I can't begin to explain
how weird that was.

1498
01:03:30,668 --> 01:03:31,668
I'm in.

1499
01:03:31,704 --> 01:03:32,774
- Yes!
- Fuck yeah.

1500
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:34,017
Alright.

1501
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:34,949
I hate the fucking
city anyways, man.

1502
01:03:35,052 --> 01:03:36,191
- Perfect.
- He didn't say

1503
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:37,513
we're gonna move there
permanently, though.

1504
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:38,884
Trust me, guys, okay?

1505
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:41,818
Mac, you're in, Paul's in, you,

1506
01:03:41,921 --> 01:03:43,233
you're, she's good.

1507
01:03:43,336 --> 01:03:46,063
I'm in if Lucifer's
Cabin is out.

1508
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:47,582
Oh my God.

1509
01:03:47,685 --> 01:03:50,965
Please tell me that we can
retire Lucifer's Cabin?

1510
01:03:51,068 --> 01:03:52,080
We will retire Lucifer's Cabin.

1511
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:52,829
We had some laughs.

1512
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:54,071
Yes.

1513
01:03:54,175 --> 01:03:55,072
- Mac, can you?
- I mean, I do not

1514
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:55,762
- have any laughs.
- It's recorded.

1515
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:57,005
Let's go.

1516
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,799
What you scared of, ghosts?

1517
01:03:57,903 --> 01:03:59,042
Come on.

1518
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:00,226
- What are you scared of?
- Okay.

1519
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,078
- Safe.
- I'm just saying

1520
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:02,045
that there are, you know,

1521
01:04:02,148 --> 01:04:03,356
there are logistical concerns.

1522
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,220
He's essentially
an expert, okay?

1523
01:04:05,324 --> 01:04:07,360
He saw everything
that Hell House found.

1524
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:08,464
What do you wanna do?

1525
01:04:08,499 --> 01:04:09,638
Do you wanna go in blind?

1526
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:12,020
Do you wanna lead the
way to the basement?

1527
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,231
Obviously not.

1528
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:33,490
Max, easy on the drinks,

1529
01:04:33,593 --> 01:04:34,593
keep them light.

1530
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:35,848
Come on, the drunker they are,

1531
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,883
the better reviews
they'll leave.

1532
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:37,632
Yeah, yeah.

1533
01:04:37,735 --> 01:04:38,735
Harvey, go easy.

1534
01:04:39,427 --> 01:04:40,427
Okay, dad.

1535
01:04:51,335 --> 01:04:52,335
Woo!

1536
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:54,994
Thank you all for coming out.

1537
01:04:55,098 --> 01:04:57,824
The hotel will open momentarily.

1538
01:04:57,928 --> 01:05:00,551
Deals will be made
with the devil.

1539
01:05:00,655 --> 01:05:02,864
God will forsake you.

1540
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:06,074
You'll follow us
as we fall in love

1541
01:05:06,178 --> 01:05:09,250
and battle with our
innermost demons!

1542
01:05:10,147 --> 01:05:11,873
Into heaven and hell.

1543
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:15,497
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Insomnia!

1544
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:20,547
You look good, how do you feel?

1545
01:05:20,571 --> 01:05:21,607
Fucking great, darling.

1546
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,402
Ready to go.

1547
01:05:23,505 --> 01:05:25,818
Faust, ready.

1548
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,000
If there's anything we can do

1549
01:05:38,037 --> 01:05:40,453
to make your stay
more comfortable.

1550
01:05:40,557 --> 01:05:43,767
Hope you find everything
quite acquaint

1551
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,941
and homey.

1552
01:05:45,044 --> 01:05:46,356
The bar is open,

1553
01:05:47,564 --> 01:05:49,566
the dining room is
ready to serve you.

1554
01:05:49,669 --> 01:05:50,669
Woo-hoo.

1555
01:05:52,879 --> 01:05:53,879
A wager, then?

1556
01:05:56,124 --> 01:05:57,988
No man can resist evil.

1557
01:06:00,508 --> 01:06:03,890
If I can destroy what
is divine in Faust,

1558
01:06:04,891 --> 01:06:06,755
the earth will be mine.

1559
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:11,001
He's already a complicated soul,

1560
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:12,865
like all men.

1561
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,317
He preaches good,
but he does evil.

1562
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:21,701
Gretchen is clear,

1563
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:23,472
Mephisto and Faust are en
route to Witch's Kitchen.

1564
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:24,497
20 seconds.

1565
01:06:24,601 --> 01:06:25,671
Okay.

1566
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:27,362
20 seconds, copy.

1567
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:33,265
Hey, Max, you have
incoming, over.

1568
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:36,026
Anybody got eyes on Russell?

1569
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,028
Last I saw him, he
was on the balcony.

1570
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:39,478
Okay, where's that?

1571
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:40,720
Do we have that?

1572
01:06:40,824 --> 01:06:41,652
We don't have
the camera on that.

1573
01:06:41,756 --> 01:06:43,068
Jeff, it's gonna be fine.

1574
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:44,828
Okay, alright.

1575
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:46,588
Just wonder.

1576
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:51,628
Poor Faust.

1577
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:56,909
Why do you seek death when
you haven't even lived?

1578
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,844
Give me the duration
of your stay here,

1579
01:07:00,947 --> 01:07:03,571
one fall of sand
through the hour glass

1580
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:06,056
and I'll be your servant.

1581
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,059
Give you anything
your heart desires.

1582
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:10,209
You do not possess the power

1583
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:11,820
to give me what I truly want.

1584
01:07:11,924 --> 01:07:13,374
Try me!

1585
01:07:13,477 --> 01:07:15,479
Sign the contract.

1586
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,550
Are those lights
supposed to be doing that?

1587
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:22,417
Yeah.

1588
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:23,384
It's the effect.

1589
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:25,213
Jeff, calm down.

1590
01:07:25,317 --> 01:07:27,112
Stay here one night.

1591
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,463
Alright, just wanna make sure.

1592
01:07:33,566 --> 01:07:35,603
You got me all nervous.

1593
01:07:38,813 --> 01:07:42,265
I can show you what
living can truly be.

1594
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:46,269
So you're lonely?

1595
01:07:46,372 --> 01:07:47,580
We can remedy that.

1596
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:08,153
Where, where is that?

1597
01:08:08,256 --> 01:08:09,740
What's going on?

1598
01:08:09,844 --> 01:08:11,017
The wine room.

1599
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:13,675
What the hell is going on?

1600
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:14,779
Holy shit.

1601
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:27,827
Someone's in 2C.

1602
01:08:27,931 --> 01:08:28,931
What?

1603
01:08:29,726 --> 01:08:30,589
Who?

1604
01:08:30,692 --> 01:08:32,142
Where is that?

1605
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:33,661
- Pull that up.
- Someone there.

1606
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:39,287
Look, somebody
should find Russell.

1607
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:44,154
Yeah, okay.

1608
01:08:44,258 --> 01:08:46,087
Wait, Jeff, Jeff!

1609
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:47,088
Vanessa said she
wants you to wear this

1610
01:08:47,192 --> 01:08:48,469
at all times out there.

1611
01:08:48,572 --> 01:08:50,333
Right, okay, alright.

1612
01:08:50,436 --> 01:08:51,575
I tried 2C.

1613
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:52,852
Yeah.

1614
01:08:58,996 --> 01:09:02,172
I guess I used your
camera after all.

1615
01:09:45,422 --> 01:09:48,563
Brilliant move with the cameras.

1616
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:53,361
We taped everything too, when
we first opened this place.

1617
01:09:54,397 --> 01:09:56,019
Who hired you?

1618
01:09:56,122 --> 01:09:57,883
Hello, old Russell.

1619
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,575
Your role is complete.

1620
01:10:02,094 --> 01:10:06,547
Just sit back and enjoy your
destiny about to be fulfill.

1621
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:11,448
We'll all enter the
lake of fire together.

1622
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:16,384
The beast's time has
come around at last.

1623
01:10:19,801 --> 01:10:20,664
Russell, Russell,

1624
01:10:20,768 --> 01:10:23,357
what the hell are you doing?

1625
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,013
What are you doing?

1626
01:10:26,187 --> 01:10:27,775
He's coming.

1627
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:29,225
You know the rules.

1628
01:10:29,328 --> 01:10:32,780
You cannot break
the deal, Faust!

1629
01:10:32,883 --> 01:10:35,127
Your life was one of old,

1630
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,337
dust and moldy books.

1631
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:39,856
This is not it!

1632
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,206
What is it that you want then?

1633
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:51,281
Remember, I have until
the hourglass runs out.

1634
01:10:51,385 --> 01:10:54,250
He doesn't make
wagers for souls.

1635
01:10:55,803 --> 01:10:59,013
It's far more
complicated than that.

1636
01:10:59,116 --> 01:11:01,395
The roots, far more ancient.

1637
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:05,675
Who are you, goddammit?

1638
01:11:05,778 --> 01:11:07,263
God is not here.

1639
01:11:17,825 --> 01:11:19,378
Oh shit, Harvey?

1640
01:11:19,482 --> 01:11:20,482
Harvey!

1641
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:25,108
Harvey, Harvey!

1642
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,738
Look, we got to get outta here.

1643
01:11:34,807 --> 01:11:36,153
To the exits, spread out!

1644
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:43,401
To the exit!

1645
01:11:45,231 --> 01:11:47,199
To the exits right
now, everyone out!

1646
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,821
Jeff, something
happened to Gregory!

1647
01:11:48,925 --> 01:11:50,961
Get the hell out
of here right now.

1648
01:11:51,065 --> 01:11:53,516
Corner bar, this way!

1649
01:11:57,589 --> 01:11:59,384
Everybody out now, to
the exits, right now!

1650
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,145
That way, keep going, this
is not part of the show.

1651
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:14,191
Get outta here.

1652
01:12:14,295 --> 01:12:15,676
You too, now.

1653
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:14,528
Help, help!

1654
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:40,450
There's some,

1655
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:42,832
there's something
happening inside the hotel.

1656
01:13:42,935 --> 01:13:44,489
We heard an alarm of some sort,

1657
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:46,629
and we definitely
heard the sound of,

1658
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:48,113
hold on.

1659
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:49,770
There's something.

1660
01:16:28,135 --> 01:16:29,412
Who are you?!

1661
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:32,208
You can't stop this!

1662
01:16:33,347 --> 01:16:34,797
You can't have her!

1663
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:48,327
As fire crews
continue to battle the blaze

1664
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:49,777
at the Abaddon Hotel,

1665
01:16:49,881 --> 01:16:52,331
I have word that all
audience members and staff

1666
01:16:52,435 --> 01:16:53,678
were found in the cornfields

1667
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:57,613
behind the hotel,
miraculously unharmed.

1668
01:16:57,716 --> 01:16:59,856
Wynn Media Group
COO, Jeff Stone,

1669
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,859
says Russell Wynn is
still unaccounted for.

1670
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:05,700
Sometime during the
20:00 p.m. performance,

1671
01:17:05,724 --> 01:17:07,001
a fire broke out quickly.

1672
01:17:07,105 --> 01:17:08,244
And reports are,

1673
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:10,487
that it started in
the hotel's basement.

1674
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,110
No word yet on the cause

1675
01:17:12,213 --> 01:17:15,078
or the whereabouts
of Russell Wynn.

1676
01:17:27,573 --> 01:17:30,576
There's nothing left, huh?

1677
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:37,307
I don't think I'll ever
figure out what happened here.

1678
01:17:37,411 --> 01:17:39,068
What happened to us?

1679
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:42,830
What happened to Russell?

1680
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:46,454
I thought I died.

1681
01:17:48,215 --> 01:17:49,215
You did.

1682
01:17:51,218 --> 01:17:53,772
Russell brought us back.

1683
01:17:53,876 --> 01:17:54,876
How?

1684
01:17:57,327 --> 01:17:59,260
It was the car crash.

1685
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:02,056
That's why he was here.

1686
01:18:04,265 --> 01:18:06,026
What a lot of people don't know

1687
01:18:06,129 --> 01:18:08,649
is that Russell
essentially died twice.

1688
01:18:08,753 --> 01:18:10,178
I don't know, we knew
about the car crash.

1689
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:11,790
Everybody knew that.

1690
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:13,792
It's how he got his scar.

1691
01:18:13,896 --> 01:18:15,449
What we didn't know

1692
01:18:15,552 --> 01:18:18,486
was that supposedly, Russell

1693
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:20,765
was legally dead
for two minutes.

1694
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:23,871
You can't go public with that.

1695
01:18:23,975 --> 01:18:25,090
I don't think
"Morning Mysteries"

1696
01:18:25,114 --> 01:18:27,254
is gonna show any of this.

1697
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:29,912
I guess you could say

1698
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:33,536
he went to the other
side and came back.

1699
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:36,194
If you believe in that stuff?

1700
01:18:36,297 --> 01:18:38,541
Do you believe that story?

1701
01:18:38,644 --> 01:18:41,820
About Russell dying
in the car crash?

1702
01:18:42,994 --> 01:18:44,247
I mean if you had asked
me a few months ago,

1703
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:45,824
I would've said no.

1704
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:48,482
But I was reminded

1705
01:18:48,585 --> 01:18:49,985
of something that
Father Paulis said

1706
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:52,141
in their first interview.

1707
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:56,214
No man could close the gateway.

1708
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:05,706
It would take an angel
from God himself.

1709
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:15,692
The most interesting
thing we've learned

1710
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:17,062
in the wake of these events

1711
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,996
is the discovery of
dozens of tapes and drives

1712
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,619
in Russell Wynn's hotel room.

1713
01:19:22,723 --> 01:19:25,553
There's a treasure
trove of information.

1714
01:19:25,657 --> 01:19:28,487
Some of the tapes have
been made available.

1715
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:33,561
Now we know what happened to
the "Morning Mysteries" people.

1716
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:38,187
The Hell House
footage, however, was

1717
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:40,292
bizarre, to say the least.

1718
01:19:40,396 --> 01:19:41,293
The police are calling them.

1719
01:19:41,397 --> 01:19:42,950
"The Abaddon Tapes".

1720
01:19:57,516 --> 01:19:59,346
Oh, what the fuck?

1721
01:20:11,945 --> 01:20:13,360
Yo!

1722
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:16,639
Yo, what the fuck
happened, guys?

1723
01:20:16,742 --> 01:20:19,228
We don't know, are you okay?

1724
01:20:20,746 --> 01:20:22,196
Yo!

1725
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,476
What happened to
you, motherfucker?

1726
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,410
Well, I went down
in the basement and...

1727
01:20:29,514 --> 01:20:30,239
You alright?

1728
01:20:30,342 --> 01:20:31,792
And then, yeah.

1729
01:20:38,454 --> 01:20:40,870
We're okay now, though, right?

1730
01:20:40,974 --> 01:20:42,527
Yeah, I think so.

1731
01:20:43,735 --> 01:20:45,288
I feel pretty fucking good.

1732
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:47,118
Yeah, yeah.

1733
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,084
I'm alright.

1734
01:20:48,188 --> 01:20:48,913
You're good?

1735
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:49,741
I'm alright.

1736
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:50,569
You're good?

1737
01:20:50,673 --> 01:20:51,398
Yeah.

1738
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:52,399
What do you say we

1739
01:20:52,502 --> 01:20:53,662
get the fuck outta here, huh?

1740
01:20:53,745 --> 01:20:54,573
Dude, let's
get the fuck outta here.

1741
01:20:54,677 --> 01:20:55,540
Let's go back to New York.

1742
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:56,955
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1743
01:20:58,819 --> 01:21:00,269
Oh, shit.

1744
01:21:00,372 --> 01:21:01,384
Tony, can you help here,
I can't get outta here?

1745
01:21:01,408 --> 01:21:02,167
One, two.

1746
01:21:02,271 --> 01:21:03,134
Unlock it.

1747
01:21:03,237 --> 01:21:04,490
It's not supposed to be locked

1748
01:21:04,514 --> 01:21:05,377
- in the first place.
- Use a deadbolt.

1749
01:21:05,481 --> 01:21:07,276
There's no deadbolt.

1750
01:21:08,173 --> 01:21:09,657
You can't leave.

1751
01:21:11,107 --> 01:21:12,212
None of us can.

1752
01:21:12,315 --> 01:21:13,420
And why the hell not?

1753
01:21:13,523 --> 01:21:15,560
Because we died here.

1754
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,458
The hotel took us.

1755
01:21:17,562 --> 01:21:18,977
Who are you?

1756
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:22,739
I'm the one who
closed the gateway.

1757
01:21:22,843 --> 01:21:25,673
You're the one who
helped open it.

1758
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,232
We're not dying here, okay?

1759
01:21:32,335 --> 01:21:33,612
We're not dying.

1760
01:21:33,716 --> 01:21:35,156
It's not supposed
to happen this way.

1761
01:21:35,235 --> 01:21:36,384
- We're not supposed to die.
- Get that shit open, man.

1762
01:21:36,408 --> 01:21:37,202
That's not supposed to happen.

1763
01:21:37,306 --> 01:21:38,928
We just did fucking.

1764
01:21:40,447 --> 01:21:41,620
No, we're not supposed to.

1765
01:21:41,724 --> 01:21:43,415
Let's just give it up.

1766
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:44,865
Just give it up.

1767
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:47,212
Aren't you gonna help me?

1768
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:50,181
Or anyone wanna help
me with this door?!

1769
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,460
Ah, fuck.

1770
01:22:04,264 --> 01:22:07,129
I'm so sorry this
happened to you.

1771
01:22:08,682 --> 01:22:10,408
It's time to move on.

1772
01:22:12,168 --> 01:22:15,068
- Wait.
- Where the fuck's he going?

1773
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,880
Aah.

1774
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:42,681
Fuck it, holmes.

1775
01:22:45,891 --> 01:22:48,894
Let's see if that
bar is still open.

1776
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,620
Let's do.

1777
01:22:58,145 --> 01:22:59,595
Let's go.

1778
01:23:03,323 --> 01:23:05,566
Come have a drink with us.
