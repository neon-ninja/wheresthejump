1
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,497
Adam!

2
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,505
Adam!

3
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,645
Adam!

4
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,452
Adam!

5
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,624
Adam!

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,094
Adam!

7
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,636
Adam!

8
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,622
Daddy?

9
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,860
Dad!

10
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,264
Dad!

11
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,238
Adam!

12
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,245
Adam!

13
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,382
Oh, god! Adam!

14
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,817
Oh, god!
Adam!

15
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,052
Oh, my god.

16
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,520
Clint!

17
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,754
Over here!

18
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,156
I found him!

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,394
I found him. I found him.

20
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,578
All right, you're good to go.

21
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,221
Hey, bill.

22
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,489
I heard from head office.
And?

23
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,891
It's not good.

24
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,065
I'm sorry, uh, who'd you--
who did you talk to?

25
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,433
Uh, Janice.

26
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,035
One second.

27
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,737
Hello?

28
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,672
Oh, hey.

29
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,442
No, that-that doesn't matter.

30
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,110
'Cause he doesn't care.

31
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,547
Yes, I will remind him. 6:30.

32
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,082
No.

33
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,984
'Cause that's just who he is.

34
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,120
Okay, I love you, too.

35
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,189
Bye.

36
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,523
Sorry.

37
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,092
Head office wants
this done right away.

38
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,027
They wanna try and save
their third quarter.

39
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,129
Clint, they want you to lay
these people off

40
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,564
by the end of the month.

41
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,165
How many by the end
of the month?

42
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,367
Four.

43
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,335
Four, bill? Jesus Christ, four?

44
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,637
We gotta do this.

45
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,473
Four people without jobs
is better than 50.

46
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,611
No, you know what?
Call head office one more time.

47
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,446
See if there's anything
we can do. Please?

48
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,848
They're not gonna budge,
Clint.

49
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,250
Well, then those corporate
clowns can come down here

50
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,885
and tell them themselves.

51
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,421
Tell their families they don't
have jobs or money or any--

52
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,793
I'm sorry, bill. That's not you.

53
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,729
Okay? I get it.

54
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,399
Hey, Gary. What's going on?

55
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,068
There's some guy here,
says he's your brother.

56
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,369
Adam?

57
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,539
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.
I'll be right out.

58
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,790
Hey, Adam.
Hey.

59
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,325
I didn't expect you
to come here,

60
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,026
I thought we'd just meet
at the house.

61
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,229
I thought I'd just come by
and, you know,

62
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,864
see the place.

63
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,333
I hope you didn't wait
too long.

64
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,135
No, no. They gave
me some coffee.

65
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,770
You didn't drink it,
did you?

66
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,406
Heh. No.

67
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,741
This thing.

68
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,945
It's been there since
we were kids.

69
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,714
Yeah.

70
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,851
So you're doing dad's
old job, huh?

71
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,456
Well, sort of, I guess.

72
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,758
I'm head of operations.

73
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,026
Dad, uh...

74
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,362
Hated sitting
behind a desk, right?

75
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,331
Right.

76
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,100
I could take you on
a tour if you like.

77
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,736
Not that much has changed.

78
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,437
Sure.

79
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,041
All right.

80
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,143
But you'll have to wear
one of these, bud.

81
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,517
You know, on second thought
maybe I'll, uh...

82
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,952
Maybe I'll just see
you at the house.

83
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,488
I'm gonna take a drive
through town.

84
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,423
Yeah, okay. No problem.

85
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,126
See you in a bit.

86
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,560
Oh, hey.

87
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,530
Dinner is at 6:30, all right?

88
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,933
6:30. Got it.

89
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,020
Have I met uncle Adam before?

90
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,221
No.

91
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,257
No, you haven't, buddy.

92
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,426
I'm hungry.

93
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,561
I'm hungry, too.

94
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,134
Okay, fine. Let's eat.

95
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,806
Is that him?

96
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,608
Could be.

97
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,477
Stay right there.

98
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,722
Hey. You re late.

99
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:42,194
Yeah, sorry. I just...
Lost track of time.

100
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,729
I see.

101
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,566
Well, let's go
meet the family.

102
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,681
Hey, guys. This is
your uncle Adam.

103
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,749
Hi.
It s good to see you, Adam.

104
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,253
You too, Sophie.
Come on in.

105
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,488
Hey, buddy.

106
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,256
Hi.
How old are you?

107
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:15,694
Six. And she's my little sister,
and she's three.

108
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,029
Three, huh? Hi.

109
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,165
We almost got started
without you.

110
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,733
Well, thanks for waiting.

111
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,793
I went for a drive
around town today.

112
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,495
Just for old time's sake.
Oh, yeah?

113
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,696
Yeah.

114
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,632
It hasn't changed one bit.

115
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,267
What did you expect?

116
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,670
An urban sprawl of office
buildings and coffee shops?

117
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,272
A Starbucks maybe?

118
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,477
It's a simpler life, Adam.

119
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,212
Yeah.

120
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,215
What? I didn't say anything!

121
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,416
I know that look.

122
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,954
Man, I can t believe Bradley
is as big as he is.

123
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,055
Yeah.

124
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,357
You know he's gonna
be seven next summer?

125
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,660
Man.

126
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,862
Does he like hunting
as much as his dad?

127
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,130
Of course.

128
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,898
Mostly birds though.

129
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,334
Like, if he had to shoot a deer
he'd probably cry.

130
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,603
I think I'd bawl my eyes out
if I had to shoot a deer.

131
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,573
I'm serious.

132
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,009
You know, I can finish
up here.

133
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,411
Really?

134
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,946
You are excused.

135
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,180
Thank you.

136
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,816
I haven't done dishes
in about 10 years,

137
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,018
so I'm a little out
of practice.

138
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,990
Adam?

139
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,028
He's glad you're here.

140
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,338
"Ladies and gentlemen,
skinny and stout.

141
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,908
"I'll tell you a tale
i know nothing about.

142
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,944
"Admission is free,
so pay at the door.

143
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,614
Pull up a chair
and sit on the floor."

144
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,672
Does uncle Adam want
to stay for a while?

145
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:46,044
No, he's only gonna stay
for a quick visit.

146
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:49,080
Could I go hunting
with you?

147
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,916
No, sorry. Not this time,
buddy.

148
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,452
The deer are way, way up
in the mountain,

149
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:58,757
and it's gonna be a tough climb,
even for your old man.

150
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,841
But I really want to go
with you.

151
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,943
No, I know you do.

152
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:24,449
And I promise we'll go together
as soon as I get back.

153
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,352
But this is gonna be a really,
really long hike.

154
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,587
And hey, you know how
you like to play

155
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,690
with your little
sister sometimes?

156
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,592
Nope. Not at all.

157
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,830
Yeah, you do.

158
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,434
Anyway, that's kinda what
your uncle and I need.

159
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,537
We just need some time to
play by ourselves, all right?

160
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,341
Hmm.
I know.

161
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,444
Okay. Bedtime, buddy.

162
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,029
Where are you going?

163
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,333
I'm just gonna see some of
the guys in town at Lucy's.

164
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,802
Oh. Okay.

165
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,271
What?

166
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,740
Nothing.

167
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,075
Will you relax?

168
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,177
We're gonna be together
for six days.

169
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,578
I-i get it.

170
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,248
Just remember we gotta get up
early tomorrow, all right?

171
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,482
I'll be ready.

172
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,551
6:30 A.M.
i got it.

173
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,787
I know, it's-- you know,
it's just-- you can uh--

174
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,055
I can what?

175
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,824
Lose track of time.

176
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,125
Will you take it easy?

177
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,928
It's a camping trip,
not a shuttle launch.

178
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,329
All right.

179
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,732
I wouldn't go to Lucy's
if I were you.

180
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,835
You'll end up getting drunk and
marrying one of the local gals.

181
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,038
I would have to be extremely
drunk to end up

182
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,641
with one of those town heifers.

183
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,610
Are you calling me
a heifer?

184
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:37,282
What? No, not you, i
mean--

185
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,818
come on, you know
what I mean.

186
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,286
You come home drunk,

187
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,621
I'm sending the kids
into your room at 6:00 A.M.

188
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,223
Sure.

189
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:48,726
Hey, you guys should do
a little um...

190
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,628
Redecorating in here.

191
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,597
It's been the same since 1986.

192
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,867
Start with that couch.

193
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,237
I like this couch.
Yeah, me too.

194
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,440
We should change
the wallpaper, though.

195
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,947
Do you want me to run
out to the truck

196
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,548
and get you a proper shirt?

197
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,151
I mean, what is that, anyway?

198
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,886
It's called a t-shirt.
It s a new thing.

199
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,421
I know him.

200
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,022
He invented communism.

201
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,225
Yeah, something like that.

202
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,627
What are you, some sort of
commie now, or what?

203
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,898
Why are you here?

204
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,499
I'm visiting my brother.

205
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,102
Actually, I'm going hunting
with him if you can believe it.

206
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,971
Nobody's got anything bigger
than a grouse

207
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,606
over the last five years.

208
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,642
Your brother'd be off his rocker
if he thinks he can bag a deer.

209
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:41,012
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
we don't even see one.

210
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,580
Didn't you hate hunting?

211
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,016
Yeah. Still do.

212
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,755
Maybe Clint knows something
we don't know.

213
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,957
Where ya headed,
anyways?

214
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,326
All the way up to the plateau.

215
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,866
What?

216
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,469
You remember Doug Grant?
Hardware store?

217
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,504
No.
He went up there 10 years ago.

218
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,941
It was 15 years ago and Doug
was an actual retard.

219
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,743
Shut up. He wasn't a retard.
Yes, he was.

220
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,212
Okay. Regardless,
what happened to him?

221
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:18,583
He went up to the plateau...
Never came back.

222
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,320
And that's it?

223
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,123
And nobody ever found out
what happened to this guy?

224
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,658
Don't worry, buddy.

225
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,227
We'll come looking for you.

226
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,631
I'm gonna get a drink.

227
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,970
Did you charge
your cell phone?

228
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,372
Yeah, the thing is, uh...

229
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,742
Cell phones don't work about
four hours into the hike, so...

230
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:48,046
Ah, how convenient
for you.

231
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,982
Right?

232
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,251
No, trust me. I would...

233
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,320
I would definitely
call you if I could.

234
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,456
Six days with just
my brother?

235
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,125
Pretty sure I'm gonna end up
just talking to the trees.

236
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,566
Night, hon.

237
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,401
Goodnight.

238
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,342
Clint?
Yeah?

239
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,712
Don't shoot your brother.

240
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,648
I just-- I don't wanna hear
a story that I can't un-hear.

241
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,283
You're wrong, man. You do.

242
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,819
'Cause w-- we--
she just-- I don't know,

243
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,455
she just like turned over
quickly and all of a sudden

244
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,590
her tits were flapping up
in my face!

245
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,626
What do you mean,
she turned around?

246
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,095
How does that happen?

247
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,596
It just-- yeah.

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,034
Boys, it's late.
Unh. Yeah. Woah.

249
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,369
I think I gotta go home.

250
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,471
Hey, cheers.
It was good to see you guys.

251
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,972
Cheers. Yeah.

252
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,474
Yeah, you too, man.

253
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,045
Don't wait another 15 years
to come back.

254
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,780
Yeah, well if I do,

255
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,883
I bet you guys will be sittin'
right here.

256
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,451
I really hope so.

257
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,622
All right.

258
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,857
Ah.

259
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,091
All right.

260
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,493
Peace.

261
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,795
Ah, shit.

262
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,096
Ow.

263
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,565
Watch your step.

264
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,900
See ya.

265
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,615
<i> Adam!</i>

266
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,286
<i> Adam!</i>

267
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,803
Hey! Oh, my god, Adam!

268
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,305
Oh, Adam, what happened
to you? Huh? Huh?

269
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,142
Clint! Over here!

270
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,263
That mattress is terrible.

271
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,464
No one's ever complained.

272
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,500
You're the first
to whine about it.

273
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,335
Coffee?

274
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,109
Good times with
your old friends?

275
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,850
I'll see you outside.

276
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,676
Wow.

277
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,346
What?

278
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,551
What do you expect to carry
in that backpack?

279
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,388
I got some food, i
got my sleeping bag.

280
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,591
Okay, what kind
of sleeping bag?

281
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,025
What difference
does it make?

282
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,895
It's gonna be
freezing up there.

283
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,831
I don't know what kind
of sleeping bag it is.

284
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,438
What is this?

285
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,872
I packed you a bag.

286
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:42,907
Why?

287
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,277
Well, let's just say
i had a hunch.

288
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,945
Look. Just because
you think you know

289
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:52,950
what you're doing does not mean
i need you to pack me a bag.

290
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,318
Right.

291
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,287
Well, then
let's take your car.

292
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,327
Why do you gotta
be such a dick?

293
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,399
I see you traded in
dad's old truck.

294
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,572
Yeah, dad's died
a few years back.

295
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,708
He left you the house,
he left you the truck.

296
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,311
What else did he leave you?

297
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,281
Guilt?

298
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,495
You scared the piss outta me.

299
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,698
Will you come on?
I wanna get there before dark.

300
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,375
That's dad's gun, right?
Yep.

301
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,210
Can I use yours?

302
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,812
No.

303
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,915
You can't hit the bright side
of a barn with dad's gun.

304
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,149
Can I drive?

305
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,918
Also no.

306
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,459
You ready?
No.

307
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:39,049
Man, I love this place.
Yeah, it's great.

308
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,788
So how far are we going?

309
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,723
Well, we re gonna hike
around to that point,

310
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,992
then we are right
on the plateau.

311
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,527
Wow.

312
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,961
Yeah, i-i still
don t understand why

313
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:54,064
we don't just take the quad
all the way up there.

314
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:57,201
I mean, it's a machine
that's built to do that.

315
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,870
Because, precious,
we're doing this old school.

316
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,540
I want the sound of engines and
the smell of gas miles behind.

317
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,510
Poetic.

318
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,887
So we're gonna hike up
to the plateau.

319
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,622
Yeah. Why?

320
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,092
Uh. Nothin'.

321
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:25,563
Just the, uh, the guys
last night, they were sayin'--

322
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,165
okay, what did your ladies
tell you last night?

323
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,068
Nothing. They just said nobody
goes up there anymore.

324
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,305
Let me guess. They told you
the story of Doug Grant?

325
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,539
Yeah.

326
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,775
Doug had no business being
up here.

327
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:40,444
The guy was half retarded.

328
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:43,481
You know, in the civilized world
we don't use that word anymore.

329
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,416
Just so you know.

330
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,184
Whatever.

331
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,653
People don't come up here
'cause it's a bitch to hike to,

332
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,956
not because of some
old wives tale.

333
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,860
And I bet there are huge deer
just begging to be harvested.

334
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:58,929
And this was your idea.

335
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,165
Killed.

336
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,500
Huh?

337
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,602
Huge deer up there
just begging to be killed

338
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,003
is what you meant.

339
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,771
Whatever.

340
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,773
I bet even if we miss
we could just walk up and...

341
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,008
Club them with your gun.

342
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,077
Yeah, exactly.
Hey, screw it, man.

343
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,945
Listen, I'm in.

344
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,147
Let's go kill some deer
in the face.

345
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,016
Harvest.

346
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,751
Uh, murder.

347
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:34,498
<i>Okay, Clint, get him on target.</i>

348
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,100
Don't bring your head
to the scope,

349
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,168
but bring the scope
to your head.

350
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,004
Right.

351
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,673
Aim a bit to the right,
the wind'll push it a bit.

352
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,775
You wanna hit him
in the chest.

353
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,478
Okay. I got it, dad.

354
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,013
When you're ready.

355
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,651
He's down.

356
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,019
Great shot, son!

357
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,954
Now the hard work
begins, huh?

358
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,924
The fun stops
when the animal drops.

359
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,500
Hey.

360
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:12,670
You always wanna keep the shell
from your first kill.

361
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,905
Okay, dad.

362
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,748
You know, there's shooting light
for about another hour or so.

363
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,117
You wanna see
what we can see?

364
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,754
Uh... nah.

365
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,925
You can,
knock yourself out.

366
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,329
I think I'm just gonna chill out
here for a moment.

367
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,565
Oh, yeah.

368
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,634
All right.

369
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,680
Did you hear that noise?

370
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,415
It was hard to miss.

371
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:07,818
Well, have you ever heard
anything like that before?

372
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,387
No, never.

373
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,122
The hell was that?

374
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,857
Relax, child.

375
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,392
There's a bunch of mines
out here.

376
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,627
They're probably fracking.

377
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,429
The sound carries out here.

378
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,498
You're just used to your
city noises, that's all.

379
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,667
Yeah, well I've never heard
a noise like that,

380
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,069
in the city or anywhere.

381
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:28,739
And it wasn't fracking,
I'll tell you that much.

382
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,174
Really?

383
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,375
What?

384
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,111
The fire.
Oh, come on.

385
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,313
We got a whole other day
of hiking ahead of us.

386
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,448
I'm cold.

387
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,483
The smoke will embed
in our clothes and--

388
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,752
the smoke's gonna-- okay, sure.

389
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:43,821
Oh, 'cause you hunt. Yeah.

390
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:46,490
Well-- didn't you bring
any deer piss?

391
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,625
That's what we use to mask
our smells, right?

392
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,594
Deer piss? Am I right?

393
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,929
Yes, as a matter
of fact I did.

394
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,664
Okay, so then what's
the problem?

395
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,066
Okay. Tonight only.

396
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,472
Did you see anything while
you were out there?

397
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:05,175
Yeah. A small Doe.

398
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,579
Really?
That's great!

399
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:12,983
Maybe we don't have to go
as far to find some deer then.

400
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,119
She's probably just lost.
The big bucks,

401
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,755
they're higher up
the mountain this time of year.

402
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,865
Great. Ah.

403
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,220
What is that?

404
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,959
It's nothing.
Go back to sleep.

405
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,696
I can't go back to sleep.

406
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,198
It sounds like
it's getting closer.

407
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,833
It's just your imagination.

408
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:05,702
Everything sounds louder
out here.

409
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,005
Woah, woah, woah.

410
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,506
What was that?

411
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:10,741
Don't-- don t do that.

412
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:12,376
No, no, no.
I'm-- I'm serious.

413
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,112
I heard something else.

414
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,047
Okay, we're leaving,
all right?

415
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,816
There's no way I'm going up
any further.

416
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,217
Shh.

417
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,427
I told you, everything sounds
louder out here.

418
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,085
Wake up, bro.

419
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,789
We walk from here.
Let's get going.

420
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:01,859
Can't we just keep taking
the quad?

421
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,161
Nope.

422
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,978
Mom, mom, mom, I got one!

423
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,846
I finally got one.
Where's Adam?

424
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,147
He's upstairs.
Okay.

425
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:25,549
Hi.
Oh, hi.

426
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,153
You guys are late.

427
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,590
Yeah, we had to go up
further than last year.

428
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,325
How'd it go?

429
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,927
Yeah, good.

430
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,428
He got his first one.

431
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,365
Unh. Did he cry?

432
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,202
Of course not.

433
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,075
You should have taken Adam.

434
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,977
He wouldn't have come anyway.

435
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,179
Yeah, but you still
should ask.

436
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,781
He thinks you favor Clint.

437
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,616
He's not like that at all.

438
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:03,453
Clint and I just like
the same things.

439
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,689
Well, maybe, as the adult
in the relationship,

440
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:09,226
you can find something that you
and Adam can enjoy together.

441
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,601
Hey, hey, hey.

442
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,270
Get washed up before
you come near me.

443
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,340
Ow!

444
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:24,975
Out!

445
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,946
Hey, Adam.

446
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,851
Guess what, dink?

447
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,821
Adam, guess what?

448
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,289
I shot a deer.

449
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,325
Got him right in the chest.

450
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,427
Good for you.
You killed something.

451
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,829
Dad said it was the biggest one
he's seen in years.

452
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,864
Almost a fourteen pointer!

453
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,433
I have no idea
what that means.

454
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,568
Oh, well, you have to count
the times in the rack--

455
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,504
Clint, what I meant to say is,
i don't care.

456
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,673
Well, maybe you would care
if you came with us for once

457
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,810
instead of reading
some stupid comic book.

458
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:03,380
Walking through the woods
looking for something to kill?

459
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,015
No, thanks.

460
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,450
You're such
a little jerk.

461
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,018
Whatever.

462
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,987
Dick!

463
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,688
Bring it!

464
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,763
Bit different from your spin
and yoga classes, huh?

465
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,165
Shut up.

466
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:35,172
So the good news is we only
have to get to the top of that.

467
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:40,043
The bad news is we gotta go
the long way around.

468
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,445
We're going up there?

469
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:42,979
Yeah.

470
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,381
Well, why don t we just cut
it short

471
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,683
and just climb up
right here?

472
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,885
Because it's too steep,
we don't have ropes,

473
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,689
and you're carrying a 40 pound
backpack, that's why.

474
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:56,026
It doesn't look
that dangerous to me.

475
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:58,462
Looks can be deceiving. It's
smarter to just go around.

476
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:01,898
No, no. Screw the hour
and a half hike.

477
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm going up here.

478
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:07,637
Hey. I'm too old to lug
you out on my back.

479
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,910
Okay.

480
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,779
Don't die.

481
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,604
Shit.

482
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,981
<i> ...first and ten.</i>

483
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:54,584
<i> The closing minutes</i>
<i> of the fourth quarter.</i>

484
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,961
Are you ignoring this?

485
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,331
Christ almighty!

486
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,571
Oh, boy.

487
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,485
All right, boys.
All right. Enough.

488
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,187
Clint! Let go
of your brother!

489
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,821
Enough. Hey. Come on.

490
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,623
Fine.

491
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,393
Adam,
go and set the table.

492
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:40,197
Clint, get those stinky,
bloody clothes off right now.

493
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,243
You know, your uncle and i
used to fight like you guys.

494
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:54,978
Was your brother
a dickhead, too?

495
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,313
He's not a dickhead.

496
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,181
You guys
are just different.

497
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,716
Oh, you think you're
the first brother

498
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,219
to be annoyed by
his younger sibling?

499
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,653
I don't know.

500
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,089
Why can't
he just be normal?

501
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,758
I know your brother doesn't like
the same things as us.

502
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,661
Adam probably thinks
it's you that's not normal.

503
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,862
I hate him.

504
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,934
You know, time changes
everything, bud.

505
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:22,172
You're gonna have to suck it up
and be the older brother.

506
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,573
I'll try.

507
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,544
Good. Now go wash up
for dinner, huh?

508
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,546
You smell like
a slaughter house.

509
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,915
I love you, dad.
I love you, too, son.

510
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,429
Just tell me, Rambo.

511
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:55,165
Go that way 300 yards.
300 yards?

512
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,834
That's like three
football fields.

513
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:58,968
Yes.

514
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,105
And then I want you
to push up and go left.

515
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:04,507
Okay, but if I see the deer,
why don't I just shoot it?

516
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,709
I have a gun.

517
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,877
Because your job is
to push it up to me.

518
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,380
Oh, I see.

519
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,215
Because you want
first shotsies.

520
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,416
Okay, that's cool.

521
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:15,085
I get it.

522
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,153
Shotsies?

523
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,622
Just go.

524
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,598
Hey.

525
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,501
So?
Did you miss?

526
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,169
No, I got him for sure.

527
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,005
He just didn't drop.

528
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,540
I can t believe you took
the shot.

529
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,908
Me either.

530
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,877
So where'd you hit him?
In the chest, I think,

531
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:24,647
but he moved a little bit
when I shot.

532
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,049
What'd he look like?

533
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,117
He was big.

534
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,021
You, okay?

535
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,256
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,124
Come on, let's get him.

537
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,873
Anything?
No, nothing.

538
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,546
What is that?

539
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:57,947
I-i--
what is that?

540
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,883
I don't know!

541
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,553
Come on,
let's just go.

542
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,760
Adam, come on.

543
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,556
What is that shit?

544
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,157
It's dinner,
all right?

545
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,560
And it'll be delicious.

546
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:51,034
You know, I can't believe
you took that shot.

547
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:54,170
Never in a million years
did I think you would do that.

548
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,809
I feel like shit about it.

549
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,312
You eat meat, right?

550
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,917
I think we should go home
tomorrow.

551
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:13,456
No. We can't leave
that deer out there.

552
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,225
And all of a sudden why are
you so anxious about going home?

553
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:20,129
This was your idea.

554
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:23,299
Why did you wanna come
up here?

555
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,767
Not that I mind,

556
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:29,105
I've been meaning to call you,
it's just-- why?

557
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:36,312
I just wanted to see
the town again.

558
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,848
After 15 years?

559
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,887
It just seemed like
the right time.

560
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:47,123
You're the one who turned
this into a hunting trip.

561
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,159
I thought we could just go
camping or something.

562
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:08,845
I've been having
these...Dreams.

563
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:12,582
So you wanted to come up here
because of dreams?

564
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:16,152
I gotta say that's
a little weird.

565
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:24,260
You know, dad would have
been happy about this.

566
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,795
Why?

567
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:27,563
Because I'm hunting?

568
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,132
No, you idiot.

569
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:30,333
Because...

570
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,841
You know, no matter what,
he was our dad.

571
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,478
He was way more
of a dad to you.

572
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,614
Well you certainly didn't
take the high road

573
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:45,915
when he needed you,
did you?

574
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,651
He didn't need me.
He had you.

575
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,286
I had to look after him
all by myself.

576
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,554
You think that was fun?

577
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,023
Do you really think that he
would have wanted me around?

578
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,558
I wanted you around, Adam.

579
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,695
I wanted you there for me.
For me.

580
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:02,365
Can you jus-- you know what?
Never mind.

581
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,907
You know he asked about you
all the time?

582
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:13,309
He wanted to know
what you were up to.

583
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:17,613
And he hoped you would visit
one last time.

584
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:19,849
I came for the funeral.

585
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,986
The fu-- the funeral?

586
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:26,723
That was closure for you.

587
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,061
I didn't come up here
to defend him.

588
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,834
That part of
our lives is over.

589
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,403
I just promised him I would
make it right.

590
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:44,073
And when you suggested
coming up here I thought--

591
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,243
I thought you could close
the book.

592
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:51,614
You and I will never agree
about our father.

593
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:52,849
If you're okay with that,

594
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:56,786
then I'm okay with closing
the book.

595
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:59,388
That looks like shit.

596
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,834
What came between
you and dad, anyway?

597
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,906
You.

598
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,502
Who are you?

599
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,347
You okay?

600
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,585
Yeah. I-i just, uh...

601
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,921
I had a bad dream.

602
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,226
Want your binkie?

603
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,457
Adam, I got it.

604
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:16,993
You're kidding?

605
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:18,895
That's great.

606
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,396
Let's go.

607
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,764
Yeah.

608
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,137
Maybe we can see something
from up there.

609
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,707
Where?

610
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,547
Oh, shit.

611
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,950
Come on.

612
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:04,033
What the hell?

613
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,545
Adam.

614
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,999
This is seriously
fucked up, man.

615
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:38,667
One second.
No, no.

616
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:41,404
No, Adam, this is
a very bad idea.

617
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,348
I recognize this place.
It's, uh...

618
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,754
Listen, I don't care.

619
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,523
We gotta get outta here.

620
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,127
Yeah, you're right.

621
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:07,329
Let's get the hell
outta here.

622
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,983
Adam. Slow down.

623
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,853
<i> Adam, slow down!</i>

624
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,491
Adam!

625
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:36,792
Oh, shit! Shit!

626
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,794
Hang on, buddy!

627
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:50,072
Here we go. Here we go.
No, no, no! Aah!

628
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,860
What did you do?

629
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:12,962
I'm sorry, bro. I had to.

630
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:16,799
You wouldn't have been able
to move if I didn't.

631
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:20,936
You have any morphine
in that pack?

632
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:23,405
No, sorry.

633
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,118
What do you want? Let me get it.

634
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,254
I got it.

635
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,059
You can give it a try,

636
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,761
but I wouldn't get
your hopes up.

637
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,200
Nothing.

638
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:55,304
We're moving more in the open
tomorrow morning.

639
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:57,540
Give it another try then,
all right?

640
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,811
Sure.

641
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:14,356
What the hell was that shit
up there?

642
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,325
I'm not sure, man.

643
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,600
What?

644
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,635
Nothing.

645
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:29,705
It's just my imagination
getting the better of me.

646
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,840
What?

647
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,509
It was just an old deer
or something.

648
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:36,545
Antlers were all broken
and ugly.

649
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,751
What happened to you
up there?

650
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:45,421
I don't know.

651
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:47,456
You said you recognized
the place, but you've--

652
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,558
you've never been
there since--

653
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:53,862
since when?

654
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:57,466
You don't remember?

655
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:58,968
Dad and I lost you
when you were four.

656
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,972
We were hiking and you just...
Disappeared.

657
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:04,974
What? What happened?

658
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:06,609
Nothing. Nothing happened.

659
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:11,780
We-- we found you after a few
hours, dad was panicking and...

660
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:15,050
Seriously, you don't
remember at all?

661
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:17,720
<i> No. Nothing.</i>

662
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:26,795
You never did
like the outdoors.

663
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:27,997
I still don't.

664
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,269
Dad just thought you were gay.

665
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:48,984
What was that stupid thing
dad used to say?

666
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:52,187
Something about being at
the office and hunting...

667
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,689
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:57,526
A bad day huntin' beats a good
day workin' every time.

669
00:54:57,528 --> 00:55:00,562
I've never disagreed
with him more.

670
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:02,031
That's saying something.

671
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,675
What's with all these crows?

672
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:16,145
Adam!

673
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,750
Adam! Adam!

674
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,886
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck!

675
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:26,422
- What the hell was that?
- We are leaving right now!

676
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:28,223
What the hell grabbed me?
Come on!

677
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,458
Was it a bear?
No, no!

678
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,859
Goddamn bear!

679
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:42,204
Why won't you tell me
what it was? Clint!

680
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:44,606
Because I don't know,
Adam!

681
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,442
It's nothing
I've ever seen before.

682
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:47,910
Jesus Christ!

683
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:50,546
It doesn't change the fact
that we gotta get off

684
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:52,181
the goddamn mountain!
All right?

685
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,717
It doesn't matter! We'd be in
the same boat if it was a bear!

686
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,119
No, we wouldn't! At least,
a bear is an animal!

687
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,721
Whatever, we gotta leave.

688
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:01,156
Being scared and pissing
ourselves doesn't get us off

689
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,658
this goddamn mountain!

690
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,326
Do you even know where
you're going?

691
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:08,330
- I am just trying to get away.
- Farther away.

692
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:09,732
What the fuck does that mean?

693
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:11,633
Well what the hell do you
wanna do? Huh?

694
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:14,536
You wanna-- you wanna wait
for that thing to come?

695
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,643
Come on.

696
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,445
- Almost there.
- Okay.

697
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,035
Come on. Sit down.

698
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,279
Are you okay?

699
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:59,047
Are you gonna
be all right here?

700
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,016
Yeah.

701
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,297
If you see anything
that isn't me, you shoot it.

702
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:16,565
You hear me?

703
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,367
I'll come back down.

704
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,068
That's a good plan.

705
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,307
Where's your phone?

706
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,476
In the pocket of my bag.

707
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,651
Oh, god.

708
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,993
You good?

709
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,295
Yeah.

710
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,596
Okay.

711
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:50,065
If you could hurry
that'd be fantastic.

712
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,767
I'm on it.

713
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,369
You okay?

714
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,505
Yeah, I'm good!

715
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:03,198
Goddamn cell phone.

716
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,274

01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,797

720
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,938
Adam! I see something!

721
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,273
What?

722
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:46,475
Adam!

723
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:48,410
Adam, it's coming!

724
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,380
Where is it?

725
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:56,885
I don't see anything!

726
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:58,453
Adam, it's right
in front of you!

727
01:00:58,455 --> 01:00:59,721
Shoot!

728
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,123
Shoot it!

729
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,486
Holy shit! Holy shit!

730
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:33,255
Oh, my god!

731
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,325
Oh, my god.

732
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:38,727
Oh, my god.

733
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,415
Okay, okay, okay.

734
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:52,861
Okay, okay, okay,
it's okay.

735
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,604
Oh, Jesus!

736
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,005
Oh, god!

737
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,049
Oh, god!

738
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,521
Okay.

739
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:29,998
Adam?

740
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,467
Adam, are you--
are you there?

741
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,520
I'll get you out!

742
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,222
I'll get
you out!

743
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,638
I can't.

744
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,207
I can't. I can't.

745
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,669
Oh, god. Oh, please.

746
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:13,655
Hello?

747
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,356
S-Sophie?

748
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:19,027
Hello? Who is this?

749
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:21,663
Sophie, it s me--

01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:24,099
Yes! Sophie!

752
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,500
Sophie!

753
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:26,935
Sophie--

754
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:31,172
you're cutting in and out.
Where are you?

755
01:08:31,174 --> 01:08:32,674
I'm sorry.

756
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:34,976
Sorry for what?

757
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:36,911
I can't--
i can't leave him.

758
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:40,582
Clint!

759
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:41,883
Sophie?

760
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:44,786
No! No.

761
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:04,666
Where is he?

762
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:29,757
Adam, is that you?

763
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,793
You're awake.

764
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,332
What happened?

765
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,608
Where are we?

766
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,478
You really think
we're done with you?

767
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,752
Hey, easy. Easy Adam.

768
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:33,054
Calm down.

769
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,691
Calm down, bud.

770
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:38,826
It's me, okay?

771
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,596
Adam.

772
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:51,205
Where are we?

773
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:55,043
We're almost back
to the truck.

774
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:57,979
How long was I out?

775
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,814
A while.

776
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:02,984
Are you okay?

777
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,763
What the hell
happened to me?

778
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:23,204
I don't know for sure.

779
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:25,740
But you're back, all right?

780
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:35,083
I felt like-like something
was trying to take me.

781
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,922
It took me, didn't it?

782
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,224
Oh, god.

783
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:45,626
I can still feel it!
Ah, ha.

784
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:47,161
Come on, Clint!
We have to go!

785
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:51,699
Adam, listen.
Listen. Listen.

786
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:57,038
The quad's out of gas, but we
are only a half day walk away.

787
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,143
You just-- you just
need to rest.

788
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:10,151
We will leave
at first light.

789
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,234
What the hell?

790
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:27,835
It's that...

791
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,851
Where are you?
Where are you?

792
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,126
Damn it!

793
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,868
Where is it?
I don't know!

794
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,612
Clint! Clint!

795
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,520
Clint, what's wrong?

796
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,991
Oh, shit! Shit!

797
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:54,615
No! No!

798
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,824
Clint!

799
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:47,695
What happened?

800
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,132
Where's your brother?

801
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:54,669
He-- he--

802
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,070
oh, there he is.
