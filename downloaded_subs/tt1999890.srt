00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:33,618
I don't know why you're so freaked
out, you're with us, don't worry.

9
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:48,364
This better be worth it.

10
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:51,166
Okay, just stay
in front of me. You go first.

You guys, it's a dead... End.

16
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,178
Seriously?

17
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,911
It's not funny.

18
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,537
<i>Enter if you dare.</i>

19
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,567
Great. It's a dead end.

20
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,669
Shit. Another scare?

21
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:14,411
Wait.

22
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:18,980
You're the one that's been following
me all night, aren't you?

23
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,620
Okay, stop!

24
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,291
I'm scared, okay?
Is that what you wanna hear?

25
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,426
Now, leave me alone.

26
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,930
Thank you so much.

27
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,709
Nat? Oh, my God!

28
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,144
What? You're here!

29
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,812
What? Oh, my God!

30
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:01,048
- How are you?
- I'm good! How are you?

31
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,985
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

32
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:05,754
- Yay.
- Wow, why is she here?

33
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,755
Well, hello, Grade School.

34
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:09,360
It's good to see you.
How's life?

35
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:13,161
- It's great.
- Mmm.

36
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:14,829
Yeah. Why are you here?

37
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,064
Oh, she didn't tell you?

38
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,533
Dude, I live here now.
It's awesome, right?

39
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:19,668
I'm so glad you're here.

40
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,603
I was just telling Taylor
how I hoped you'd make it.

41
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,971
Such a surprise!

42
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,106
Huge surprise.

43
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,808
Why?

44
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,142
Why is it surprising?

45
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,211
Well, I mean,
just last time we talked,

46
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,079
you said you were studying.
So I didn't know if...

47
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,449
Studying?

48
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:34,817
Dude, it's October,
it is fun time.

49
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,117
You save that for December.

50
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,985
Well, some of us have
scholarships, Taylor.

51
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,555
- Kinda need to keep mine.
- Mmm-hmm.

52
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:40,956
You kinda need to get laid.

53
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,925
Brooke, your bestie needs
to get some,

54
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,593
and lucky for her,
Gavin's coming tonight!

55
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,629
You remember Gavin.
Brook already told me

56
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,730
you've wanted
to ride that D

57
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,166
since you first
laid eyes on him.

58
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,437
- Wow.
- Yeah. See, I listen.

59
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,504
I really wish you didn't.

60
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:59,106
"Ride that D," huh?

61
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,478
Her, of all people?
God, she's never liked me.

62
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,045
I don't know why you would
tell her about Gavin.

63
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,884
Hey, can't stay mad.

64
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,016
Can't stay mad.

65
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,017
Ugh!

66
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,887
She calls me "Grade School,"
for God's sake.

67
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,988
- I think it's endearing.
- No! It's not endearing.

68
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,089
It's bitchy, maybe.

69
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,524
No, it's not.

70
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:17,995
Look, she's not replacing you.

71
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,230
Nothing could ever
replace you, okay?

72
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:23,531
Please tell me I don't have to
hang out with her all weekend.

73
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,802
Uh... Tonight she's coming,
but that's it.

74
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,069
And then, it's just
you and me. Promise.

75
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,441
Unless...

76
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:31,606
Unless what?

77
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,175
Unless, you know,
you and Gavin

78
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:35,843
want some alone time
this weekend.

79
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:38,247
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing, I promise!

80
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,048
He's just the one that got us
the VIP passes to Hell Fest.

81
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,117
What is that?

82
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,019
Dude, it's so
fucking dope! Okay?

83
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,721
Like, it's a traveling
horror night.

84
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:47,589
People totally lose their shit
in there. It's really fun.

85
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:48,856
You're not
selling me on it.

86
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,591
No, it's great!
It's gonna be fun!

87
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,226
Tickets sold out
the minute they went on sale.

88
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,596
But your boy Gavin came through
and got some tickets for us.

89
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,031
Okay, we don't need
to do this dance now.

90
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,035
And he's been
asking about you.

91
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,170
- Really?
- He was like...

92
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,940
"Hey, Brooke, is your hot
friend coming this weekend?"

93
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,307
Wait, he called me hot?

94
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,810
Apparently, someone made
a great impression on him

95
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:09,944
this past summer.

96
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,012
Why is that surprising?

97
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:14,249
He was like,
"Hey Brooke, uh...

98
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,117
"You know, I should get

99
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,685
"an extra ticket
for Natalie, right?

100
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,185
"She's coming.
She's coming, right?"

101
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,555
"Hey, Brooke,
I know this is, like,

102
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:21,023
"really awkward and shit.
But, like,

103
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,990
"do you think that
after Hell Fest,

104
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,093
"Natalie will sit on my face?"

105
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:26,865
Shut up, he did not say that!

106
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,331
- Did he?
- I don't know!

107
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,033
But, um...

108
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,803
You're not wearing
that, right?

109
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,271
Why? What is wrong
with what I'm wearing?

110
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:37,906
Nat, it's Halloween!

111
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,574
It's the one night
out of the year

112
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:42,310
you're allowed to let out
your inner slut.

113
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,844
Yeah, I don't think
I have one of those.

114
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,947
Hey, babe... Oh. Whoa.

115
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,949
Natalie!

116
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:50,752
- I didn't think you were gonna make it.
- Can you knock?

117
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:51,952
Hi! Yeah, no, I'm here.

118
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,721
I don't know why everyone
thinks I'm not gonna be here.

119
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,223
What? No. I knew
you were coming.

120
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,992
Brooke was the one
who was like, "It's iffy."

121
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:58,627
Can you not do that?

122
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:59,827
- What are you in here for?
- I'm just... I'm ready.

123
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,062
You guys ready?
You ready for Hell Fest?

124
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,964
- You look ready.
- Baby, we need 10 minutes.

125
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:05,067
We have to meet Gavin at will call.
We're gonna be late.

126
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,670
Babe, you gotta go.
I need 10 minutes.

127
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:10,238
- Okay. I'll see you in 30.
- See you in a bit.

128
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,341
- Love you.
- Okay, so...

129
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:14,276
We need to find you
something good.

130
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,243
And make up for lost time.

131
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,312
This is dope!

132
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,379
Oh, my God!
This is awesome, guys!

133
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,247
- I know!
- It's gonna be fun!

134
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,783
Nat, don't worry! I will totally
protect you from being murdered.

135
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,752
Oh, thanks. I didn't realize
that was a possibility, but...

136
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,220
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

137
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,356
Do not be flippant.

138
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:29,724
It happens,
like in Orange Grove.

139
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,225
Oh, yeah, that was
fucked up.

140
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,361
Wait, what?

141
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:34,095
Oh, well, a couple
years ago,

142
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,330
a girl got completely gutted

143
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:37,465
in a haunted house,
like, for real.

144
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,867
The killer left her body
in the park for three days.

145
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,802
No one found her
until she started to stink.

146
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,238
They thought she was
a freaking prop!

147
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,906
- Wait, that's brutal!
- Man, what can I say?

148
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,174
Some people are just evil.

149
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,042
I mean, they're monsters.

150
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,746
To them, every single day
is Halloween

151
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,783
and they dress up,
so that we don't know.

152
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,217
Know what?

153
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,951
That they walk among us.

154
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,853
Nat, they're fucking
with you!

155
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,253
- Okay, dude...
- Are we?

156
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,555
Oh, yes, you are!

157
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,657
- Okay, murder twins, we get it. It's scary.
- I know.

158
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,724
Whatever.

159
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:04,825
- Oh, my God!
- Quinn!

160
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,395
<i>Welcome to Hell Fest!</i>

161
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,295
Hell Fest! Hell Fest!

162
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,297
Yes, I'm excited.
Okay, let's go, let's go.

163
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,002
<i>I'm so excited! Yes!</i>

164
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,706
Hey, murder twins,
wait up!

165
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,773
<i>Welcome to Hell Fest!</i>

166
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,276
All right. Let's go.

167
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,411
<i>Beyond these gates,</i>

168
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:27,683
<i>your inner fears
will come true!</i>

169
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:34,690
Whoa. Is that her?

170
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,724
- Asher's here?
- Yeah. Come on.

171
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,225
Oh, yeah.

172
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,728
You might actually
have to pretend

173
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,733
- you have game tonight.
- Asher!

174
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,565
Hey, boo.

175
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,066
Asher, this is Natalie.
Natalie, Asher.

176
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,102
- Hello, pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

177
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,301
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

178
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,704
- Hey. It's been a while.
- Hey.

179
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,406
You look great.
It's good to see you.

180
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,175
- Hell Fest!
- Welcome to VIP, bitches!

181
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,411
VIP, bitches!

182
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,347
There you go.
I can help you put yours on.

183
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,614
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

184
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:03,285
Thanks. Yeah, Brooke tells me
I have you to thank for this.

185
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,186
- So...
- Yeah, no. No problem.

186
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,488
- Thank you.
- No problem.

187
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,858
No, she said you were
coming to town, so I just...

188
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,193
I wanted us to do
something fun.

189
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,761
Great.

190
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:14,496
- Hey, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,863
You guys ready?

192
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,931
Hell Fest, guys!
Let's do this!

193
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,368
Hell Fest!

194
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:37,017
Look it, work it
for me, baby! Work it!

195
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:42,293
Oh, shit! Okay!

196
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:47,863
Hey!

197
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:48,997
Oh, shit!

198
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,268
Good Lord!

199
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,070
Wow!

200
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,305
And then there's that.

201
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,340
And then there's that.

202
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:03,111
So, just so you guys know,
fear is an aphrodisiac.

203
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,411
Yeah, it stimulates
something...

204
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,948
- The more you know.
- Deep in those lizard brains

205
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,183
and it reminds you
that life is short

206
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:12,186
and an organism's only true
purpose is to, uh, reproduce.

207
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,722
Okay. That's great.
Thank you.

208
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:17,124
It is. All right, I will let you guys
think about that and I'll be back later.

209
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,261
All right.
Thanks for the master class.

210
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,029
You're welcome!

211
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,497
I'm starting to get
the feeling our friends think

212
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,398
something's gonna happen
between us.

213
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,967
Really? No, I didn't
notice that at all.

214
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,068
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

215
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,170
You don't get
that vibe at all?

216
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:29,237
- No, I don't.
- It's very subtle.

217
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,405
Just you're picking up
on that.

218
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:32,440
Yeah, it's just me.

219
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,977
Hey, well, I'm actually...
I'm glad you came.

220
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,145
I think it's gonna be fun.

221
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,513
It's been a while
since we've hung out.

222
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,116
Yeah, I was bummed
that I had to bail.

223
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,383
I just had a bunch of shit
that I...

224
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,420
Jesus Christ!
That came so close to my face!

225
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:46,921
No!

226
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,458
You're good, this is it.

227
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,825
It's not that bad.

228
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:52,960
- It's just...
- Not the worst thing, I guess?

229
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,065
- It is time for shots!
- Shots!

230
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,300
- Yes!
- Shots!

231
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,234
Please, let's go!
Come on!

232
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,442
Raise your arms.

233
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:46,317
You're good.

234
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,970
Why do you always
switch them?

235
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,502
Thanks, man.

236
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,941
Asher! Hurry up
with those shots!

237
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,407
- Whoa. Shots!
- Yeah!

238
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,175
Nice! So we got VIP tonight,

239
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,212
so lines aren't gonna be
an issue. We are here,

240
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,512
but we need
to focus our shit,

241
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:19,647
'cause I'm trying to hit
everything tonight.

242
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:20,916
Let's do the Zombie Maze.

243
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:21,983
- Boom.
- Why?

244
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,450
Yo, Gav, what are you, five?

245
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:24,652
We didn't come here for slow.

246
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,154
If you want that,
go trick-or-treating.

247
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,689
We came here to be terrified!

248
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,991
The Zombie Maze
is fucking scary, it's...

249
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,292
I'm good with the
Zombie Maze. I am.

250
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,060
No, I wanna do Deform School

251
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,462
because I've been
a very naughty girl.

252
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,097
And I hear Deform School
is one of the scariest mazes

253
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,632
outside of the Deadlands.

254
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,434
- Wait, what are the Deadlands?
- What?

255
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,069
No, it's a part of the park

256
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,405
where they can all touch you
or something. Right?

257
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,172
Wait. For real,
they can touch you?

258
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,641
Yeah. That's where shit's
gonna get crazy.

259
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:48,142
Sounds fun, right?

260
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:49,944
Plus, it's the only way
you get to go into Hell

261
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:52,249
which is the scariest maze,
so...

262
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,151
Yeah?

263
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,484
Please?

264
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,190
Come on.

265
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,691
Sure.

266
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,062
- To Hell Fest!
- To Hell Fest!

267
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:26,680
Oh, my God!
Dude, you don't scare me!

268
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:27,684
Go back to the other freaks!

269
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:57,679
I just wanna go back home...

270
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,516
What is up with
all these assholes?

271
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:04,151
You think you're scaring me?
Ooh, you're so scary.

272
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,587
No. Move.

273
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,550
Wait! You guys,
what the fuck?

274
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:37,685
Come on, come on!

275
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,119
You don't
have to run, like...

276
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,454
- I don't like being fast.
- I don't like being...

277
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,056
- I don't like that. At all.
- I can't see anything.

278
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:44,159
Okay, we can do this.
It's okay, we got this.

279
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,526
Fuck this shit!

280
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,362
Oh, my God!

281
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,662
Okay. Hi,
thank you very much!

282
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,131
Oh, my God!
Holy shit.

283
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,633
- Brooke! Okay, okay...
- Go, go, go!

284
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,603
Oh, my God!
It's everywhere!

285
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:56,670
That was so stupid!

286
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,138
Picture,
picture, picture!

287
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,773
He got her
more than me. Thank God.

288
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:00,842
Let's go.

289
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,776
Cobwebs.
You go, you walk first.

290
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:03,978
Dude, the more scared
you seem,

291
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,646
the more they're gonna come
after you. You gotta like...

292
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,747
- You have to play it cool.
- Just relax and...

293
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,416
Yes. You... Shit!

294
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,717
Oh, my God!

295
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,718
Yeah, no, just play it cool.

296
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,686
I'll remember that.
That's great.

297
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,323
No, that...
I have a very specific phobia

298
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,558
of demon clowns.

299
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,193
These are my people.

300
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,627
Jesus Christ.

301
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,128
Come on,
come on, come on!

302
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,229
VIP!

303
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,567
Sucks to be you.

304
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:27,868
Okay, I'm sorry.
VIP band, just showed it off.

305
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,140
Tay, they pace it out
so we each go on our own.

306
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,108
Oh, can we go? Can we go?

307
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,478
And, wait, wait.

308
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,815
- Go, go, go!
- Thank you!

309
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,116
Okay. Are you ready?

310
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,382
- Yeah.
- You that ready?

311
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:43,386
Yep, I'm ready.

312
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:47,658
Go, go, go!

313
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:56,330
See? I didn't need that
in my life.

314
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,398
Don't do that! Oh, my God!

315
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,367
You know what? He deserves
at least some dignity in death.

316
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:01,903
- Let's give him a boner.
- Definitely.

317
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,538
Oh, God!
The last thing I need to do

318
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,672
is relive high school.

319
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,441
She can keep me after class.

320
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,342
Ow! Hey, Gavin.

321
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:09,610
You like paddles, right?
You said you had a fetish

322
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,245
or something.
She's got a paddle.

323
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,679
I've never said that
in my entire life.

324
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,348
Oh, freaky.

325
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,916
I don't like paddles.
They're fucking with you.

326
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,351
I mean,
if you do, man.

327
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:18,485
- I never...
- You don't like paddles?

328
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:19,787
- You're such an asshole.
- Hey, guys.

329
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,490
I don't think everyone here
is completely dead.

330
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:26,226
I mean, part of this guy
is very much alive.

331
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:28,596
Are you sexually harassing
a zombie right now?

332
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,631
Because I feel like
that's just a lot.

333
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,633
Look, all I know is

334
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,701
I definitely know
how to make the dead rise.

335
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,904
You know how
to make everything rise, baby.

336
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:37,504
- I guess we're going that way.
- We're going that way.

337
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,206
We're supposed
to follow that?

338
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:45,682
Oh.

339
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:49,951
Hurry up!

340
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,252
I'm trying. Hold on.

341
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:52,486
Oh, shit!

342
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,321
Oh. All right. No.

343
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,558
Ruined the damn photo.

344
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,629
I'm scared.

345
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:03,263
Oh, God! One of these guys
has gotta be real.

346
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:05,433
- Oh, yeah!
- Yep.

347
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,570
If you could
go first, that'd be great.

348
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,637
This...

349
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,342
- Okay, you have to look at their hands.
- Why?

350
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,578
Then you can tell
which one is real,

351
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,878
if you look at their hands.

352
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,047
Okay, but I don't like
looking at the hands,

353
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,416
because then you can't see
their skin and their faces.

354
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,819
- Yeah, that's the one.
- There you go.

355
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:27,454
Busted, sir. Or, ma'am.
I can't really tell.

356
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,323
How dare you assume?

357
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,925
I don't know, honestly.
They're all kind of...

358
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,261
Neutral.

359
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,829
Oh, hey.

360
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:35,964
This place is
kind of lame.

361
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:37,498
- Yeah, bummer.
- I like all the art...

362
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,171
Fuck! Come on!

363
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,308
Nope! Okay, go!

364
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:04,892
- Did they just ditch us?
- What the fuck?

365
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,797
- Oh, my God!
- Of course they did. Wait.

366
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,664
Wait.

367
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,832
Wait, wait.
Don't you spill my tequila.

368
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,300
Wait, no, no, no!
I just figured it out.

369
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,535
Look, she just came
out of here.

370
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:16,404
Somebody else is gonna come
out of here and freak us out.

371
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,905
Oh, great,
thank you for confirming.

372
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:18,939
Really?

373
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:20,541
Look, and then she's gonna
jump out here, too.

374
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,344
Yes, thank you. Thanks!

375
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:24,412
You're ruining this for me.

376
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,313
No, I'm telling you.
Now someone's just

377
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:28,416
gonna come out of this door
right here.

378
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,716
- All right, let's see.
- Let's see.

379
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,953
Stop saying things
at the same time.

380
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,521
And Grade School
overthought it.

381
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:35,623
And, three, two... Shut up.

382
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,425
Three, two, one.

383
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,060
Help me! He's following me.

384
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,962
- Please!
- Oh. See, your timing was off.

385
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:42,062
And location.

386
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,764
Please, help me. Please.

387
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,503
Oh, my God!
He's coming!

388
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,440
Okay. Well, I was still
kind of right.

389
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:52,508
So melodramatic.

390
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:55,411
Oh, hi, buddy.

391
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,480
Hello.

392
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,579
He got the...

393
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,481
Okay.

394
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:03,451
Class deceased.

395
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,387
If at first you don't
succeed, die and die again.

396
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:08,423
He's got the wonky eyeballs.

397
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:09,991
He's been through some things.

398
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:11,992
Yeah, you're not scary, dude.

399
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,660
- Okay.
- Did you see that?

400
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:21,703
Okay, just get back on script,
guy. Your girl's over there.

401
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:22,971
With the big arrow.

402
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,473
Where it says, "Don't look." She's
in that thing, you should...

403
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,848
No, no. Just stop!
Please.

404
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,117
Help me! Please! Please!

405
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,019
No, no, no!

406
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,454
Stop it!

407
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:40,754
Yeah, no, fuck that. I'm good.

408
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,357
Yep. Let's go.

409
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,491
Stop!

410
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,591
Stop it! No!

411
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,109
Okay, just do it.

412
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,642
That was
fucking insane.

413
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:36,410
I know. Now you know
why I wanna come here.

414
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:37,544
Yes, I get it.
This is fucking...

415
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,812
- I know!
- Jesus Christ!

416
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,181
Hey, you good?

417
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:41,916
What took you so long?

418
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:43,650
That was really fucking real
in there at the end.

419
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,355
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah! Really intense.

420
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:47,722
You need some?

421
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,490
Yes.

422
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:50,858
Go Grade School.

423
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,462
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

424
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,434
I love this place
so much!

425
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:00,501
Come on. Let's go.

426
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:01,868
She just, like, walks away?

427
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,639
You ditched us.
What do you want?

428
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,219
Looks like you made a friend,

429
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,221
Grade School.

430
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:23,023
Well, at least I wasn't crying
like a baby in there, College.

431
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,992
Okay! All right,
I might like you.

432
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:27,494
Let's keep going.
Keep it up.

433
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:28,966
I like this sassy side.

434
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,535
Wait, does she still snore
like an outboard motor

435
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:36,637
when she's drunk, because...

436
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:37,737
Like a fucking buzz saw.

437
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,840
You two are getting
a little too close, all right?

438
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:41,809
Well, you can't
stay mad, so...

439
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:43,043
Oh, one night at Hell Fest,

440
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,611
and you're coming out
of your shell.

441
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,879
It looks good, right?
It suits her.

442
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,548
Yeah.

443
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,715
Look, is that the same guy
from the Deform School?

444
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,717
- Hey!
- Don't do that.

445
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,886
- Why?
- Jesus Christ!

446
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:54,155
He's an actor. He gets paid
minimum wage to follow us.

447
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:56,256
But he's only following us.
It's stalker-ish.

448
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:57,358
- Yo, let's go.
- Keep it moving.

449
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,827
Yo, guys, this is the same
dude from Deform School.

450
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,695
Nat, he's just an actor.
They fuck with everyone.

451
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,829
Seriously, ignore him.
He'll get bored.

452
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:03,964
It works with Brooke.

453
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,166
Yeah, no, no,
that's great advice.

454
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:06,533
That always works
with stalkers. Thanks.

455
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:07,902
Hey. Listen.

456
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:10,070
If he gets too close,
I'll fuck him up for you.

457
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:12,138
Oh, my God!
That's adorable. I got it.

458
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,508
You guys are gonna
handle this one?

459
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,810
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. We got you.

460
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,512
Dude, I told you
it'd be fun with her here.

461
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,547
I know! You're right.
She's awesome!

462
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:23,818
- This is amazing.
- This is dope!

463
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,520
Oh, crap.

464
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:27,722
Oh, look, it's you.
It's your future, Ash.

465
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,189
Okay. No, no, no!

466
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:34,095
Oh, shit.

467
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:35,929
Come on, girl, let's go
win you some cheap-ass prizes.

468
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,798
That is so antiquated
of you, Ash.

469
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,867
- They have funnel cakes!
- Off we go!

470
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:40,935
Have fun, you two.

471
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,669
Hey, Gavin...

472
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,004
Great. That's...

473
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,740
Thanks, Quinn.
That was so subtle of you.

474
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:46,973
Thanks for that.

475
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,675
- I'm sorry.
- Um...

476
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,111
Here. Let's play a game.

477
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:52,946
- Are you ready for this?
- I am. Are you ready?

478
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,749
Ready as I'll ever be.

479
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:55,786
Mine.

480
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,619
You are really close.
Maybe it's just your...

481
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,023
I just need to stop
overthinking it.

482
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,956
No look.

483
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,825
- What you wanna do?
- I'm doing it, too.

484
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:06,497
Prize time. Dang it.

485
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:10,964
Are you sure
you're not left-handed?

486
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,800
- Who won? Who won?
- Yes!

487
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:16,203
Oh, wow.

488
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,838
Let me show you how it's done.

489
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,173
Well, now I just wanna
keep this.

490
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:23,780
- For my queen.
- Thanks, babe.

491
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:27,114
- Oh, wow!
- Shit!

492
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:28,316
You definitely took
that somewhere.

493
00:24:28,318 --> 00:24:30,150
- I'm sorry about that.
- Ready, one...

494
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,154
Two, three... Go!

495
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:36,059
This is painful, bruh.

496
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,626
- Okay. Thanks.
- It's not that bad.

497
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:39,629
It's pretty bad.

498
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,763
- That was close!
- It was. Thank you.

499
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:44,865
- It was...
- Yeah.

500
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:45,933
- No, no, no!
- No, I got another one

501
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:47,001
- It's more than okay.
- It's really not.

502
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:48,868
We don't have to...
It's been, like, five games.

503
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,204
You know how good
you're gonna feel

504
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:51,472
when you have a teddy bear
of your very own?

505
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,640
Sometimes you just have to
accept that it's not for you.

506
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,678
I'm sorry,
I'm so shitty at ring toss.

507
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,746
It's okay.

508
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,014
I was honestly
trying my best.

509
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:03,850
But I think my game of choice
is the one where you're like,

510
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:04,785
"Here's five dollars."

511
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:06,087
And the guy's like,
"Here's a pretzel."

512
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,253
So you pay for things?

513
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,656
Yeah, but at an incredibly
fast rate.

514
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:09,590
Okay.

515
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,791
I think that's my game
of choice. Hello.

516
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:13,094
Oh, hello!

517
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:16,097
What? Can I?
May I? Thank you.

518
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,263
Wow! It's so coiffed.

519
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,000
- It really is.
- It's so beautiful.

520
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:20,333
I think you should
get one of those.

521
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,369
I was gonna say
I think you should.

522
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,005
Well, I can't, so...

523
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,140
So what do you think so far?

524
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:28,408
Of the pretzel?

525
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,645
- Uh, no, not the pretzel.
- Good. Could use mustard.

526
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:31,679
I do want a piece of this.

527
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:34,080
- Oh, you're a mustard kind of girl?
- Mmm-hmm.

528
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,217
I meant of Hell Fest.

529
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:41,121
What do you think? Like hanging out?
Two of us?

530
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,390
- I like hanging out with you.
- Okay. Good.

531
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,358
I'm sorry that I've been
so flaky actually.

532
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,796
I've just been having a really
tough time with school

533
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,830
and work, and life, so...

534
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:52,201
It's just nice to be here.

535
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,270
- Nice to be in Hell.
- Yep. It's nice to be in Hell.

536
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:58,075
- It's the best place to be.
- Yeah.

537
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:05,212
- Come here.
- Yeah.

538
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:08,348
Oh, God! But that was
a perfectly good pretzel.

539
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,353
I'm sorry.
It was not salty enough.

540
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:16,290
Oh, God, I am so bad
at these things.

541
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,425
Oh, we have to pay
under here.

542
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,629
Yeah. Okay.

543
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,064
- What do we...
- Um...

544
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,067
Smile.
Just smile like an idiot.

545
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:27,467
Not that you're an idiot.

546
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:30,339
No, that's really the only way
I know how to do it.

547
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,312
Uh, drunk face?

548
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:40,981
Uh, sure, okay. I don't
really have a drunk face.

549
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:42,950
I don't, either.
I'm a stoic drunk.

550
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:45,051
Yeah. I'm a
very composed...

551
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,759
Um...

552
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:53,761
No, no, you don't touch it.
Just your...

553
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,128
Well, I didn't know
if I was supposed to...

554
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,300
With my tongue?
What do you want me to do?

555
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,069
How could you not know
that I was going

556
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:04,472
- for the nose-tongue picture?
- I don't know

557
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:05,607
- how many people...
- How dare you.

558
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:08,978
I didn't know there was
a type of picture you take.

559
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,786
Yo!

560
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:53,387
What the fuck? Hey!

561
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:54,554
Is that Brooke?

562
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,223
- You sure? Was that Brooke?
- Brooke?

563
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:58,462
What the hell?

564
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:01,896
That guy just
took your photos.

565
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:03,931
- What?
- Babe, here.

566
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,965
- Whoa. Whoa!
- Hey!

567
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,033
- Brooke.
- Babe!

568
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:08,037
- You guys, come on!
- Hey!

569
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,970
What's going on?

570
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:11,172
- Did you two just...
- Come on,

571
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:12,408
- let's make fun of him!
- Take pictures together.

572
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:14,945
Yo!

573
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,816
Oh, so you're hiding now?

574
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,319
You gonna scare me?

575
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:54,147
Hey, I told you to...

576
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,151
Stop.

577
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,466
Shit!

578
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:15,336
When did you become
a tough guy?

579
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:17,871
Listen, I scared him off.
Let's go.

580
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:19,473
Did you?
Did you get the photos?

581
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:20,608
No, but he's gone.

582
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,344
Here, take this.

583
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:29,116
That's gonna
consume her.

584
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:30,483
It's a pleasure to meet you.

585
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,319
Hey, guys! I found
Nat's security guard.

586
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:33,987
Hey, did you get the pictures
back? What happened?

587
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:36,389
I took care of it,
like I said I would.

588
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:37,590
- Is that what you did?
- Yes.

589
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:38,992
It's the same guy, right?

590
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,327
- Wait, Deform School guy?
- Yeah.

591
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:41,628
He's just going
for Employee of the Year.

592
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,563
He's doing pretty damn good.

593
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:44,498
I mean, look at both
of your faces right now.

594
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,367
All right, fuck this place
anyway. It is Deadlands time.

595
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,601
I wanna be touched.

596
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:49,502
Yes. Thank you!
Let's go, let's go.

597
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:50,370
All right.
Deadlands. I'm in.

598
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,172
Yeah, you guys go
and then I'm gonna

599
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,073
- catch up with you, okay?
- What?

600
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,577
Just go, and then I'm gonna
catch up to you guys.

601
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:57,677
- What, what are you...
- Just go.

602
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,112
I wanna
get her a toy.

603
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,313
Just go really quick,
and then I'll meet up.

604
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:01,447
Do what you gotta do.

605
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,183
- Okay, do you want company?
- No, no, no.

606
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:05,953
Me and the bearded lady,
we exchanged this look.

607
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,253
I think she's gonna
give me beard lessons.

608
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,289
So, I'm gonna go
get her number.

609
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,291
That's not a thing.
I can just come with you.

610
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:11,358
It's totally a thing.

611
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,425
Okay.

612
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:13,493
So, we'll meet you
in line then?

613
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:14,560
Yeah, dude,

614
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,929
if you're not there
by the time

615
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:17,097
we get to the front
of the line,

616
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,398
I'm going to Hell
without you.

617
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,566
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

618
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,466
Just be really fast.

619
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,302
'Cause she really likes you.
You know?

620
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:24,003
And, she thinks
you're really hot.

621
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,606
She doesn't wanna
do Deadlands without you.

622
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:27,374
That wasn't uncomfortable
at all.

623
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:29,310
- We're going. Let's go.
- You're not hurrying!

624
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:30,347
All right. Bye.

625
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:37,216
Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

626
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,654
Excuse me? Hey, um...
We're VIP, can we just...

627
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,556
Babe, this is VIP.

628
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:44,524
- This whole thing is VIP?
- Yeah.

629
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,159
Hey, don't worry about Gavin.

630
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:47,528
He's probably pooping
or something.

631
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,030
Okay, I did not need
to picture that.

632
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:51,264
What? Everybody poops, Nat.

633
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,167
Birds poop, bees poop. Honey!
That's where it comes from.

634
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:55,639
No more drinks for you.

635
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,175
Hey. You remember me? Earlier?

636
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:02,376
I was here playing
the ring toss?

637
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:03,513
And you were terrible at it?

638
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,548
That was me.
Thank you. Yeah.

639
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,451
Um, hey, listen,
I spent like $50.

640
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:11,922
Could you just help me out
and give me one of those?

641
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,293
Nah. I'd lose my job.

642
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,695
All right. Hey, thank you.

643
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,931
Thanks so much.

644
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:26,436
Wait, what actually happened
with that guy that you chased?

645
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,601
Mmm.

646
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:31,538
It got real intense,
so I just bailed.

647
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,374
I can't figure out what
his fucking deal is.

648
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,208
Me either.

649
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,176
But, hey, no,
you're having a great time,

650
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,177
Gavin's totally into you,

651
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:39,512
you're stepping out
of your comfort zone...

652
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:41,551
- He's cute, right?
- Hell yeah!

653
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:51,492
Hey,
are we good on stock?

654
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,327
Yeah, we got
plenty of stuffed animals

655
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,461
back in the locker.

656
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:55,665
We're good.

657
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,569
It just slipped out.

658
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:06,339
Uh, why do we keep
waiting in line for rides?

659
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,075
I thought we were doing mazes.

660
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:10,644
B, this is the ride that
takes us to the Deadlands.

661
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,146
It's the only way
to get there.

662
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:13,646
Why are we signing a waiver?

663
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:16,617
I mean, they can touch us
and liability is a bitch.

664
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:18,385
That's really extreme.

665
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,553
Extreme is what we want, Nat.
That's why we're here.

666
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,322
Plus, if you don't sign
you can't go in.

667
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,458
Oh, come on, Nat,
just sign it.

668
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,229
I was just starting to like
the new you.

669
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:29,362
Huh?

670
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,798
Just let me text Gavin
and let him know.

671
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,302
You sign. I'll text.

672
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,493
Damn.

673
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,804
Okay, Asher.

674
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:26,121
Oh, yes.

675
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:28,058
Okay...

676
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:37,434
Hmm.

677
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,475
Hmm.

678
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,312
That's good.

679
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,281
Oh, shit!

680
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:58,819
It's you again? Seriously?
You're following me now?

681
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:01,754
Nice. All right, you take
your job way too seriously.

682
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:03,589
Hope you know that.

683
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,325
You know, actually,
it's great that you're here.

684
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:07,330
Can I get
my pictures back? Or...

685
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:13,169
All right.

686
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,340
Dude, drop the character,
you're offstage.

687
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,380
Cool.

688
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:30,653
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

689
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,689
Come on, come on,
come on!

690
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,856
And...

691
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,626
- Thank you!
- Yes!

692
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:13,727
Wait. Nat, where is he?

693
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:14,861
I don't know.

694
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,629
Just text him again.
Okay? Come on.

695
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:17,997
Come on.

696
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,568
- Come on, guys!
- Yeah, we're coming!

697
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,935
- Sorry.
- Wait, slow down!

698
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:27,374
Nat, come on!

699
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,443
I'm coming.

700
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:50,597

702
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,838
- Night Bumps!
- Yes!

703
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:01,575
Wait, wait, wait.

704
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,876
Nat, come on. You gotta get on

705
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:04,410
or you lose
your place in line.

706
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,447
In or out?

707
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:08,314
Sucks to be Gavin.

708
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:10,417
- Great to be us.
- Okay.

709
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,718
Let's go. Come on,
come on, baby.

710
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,352
- Wait, Brooke.
- Oh, um...

711
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:14,588
- What?
- Hey.

712
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,555
- We should wait. No.
- No, no, no.

713
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:18,425
No, Gavin assured us,
he would be there.

714
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,626
- It's fine. Come on.
- No, wait.

715
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:21,495
- He'll be right here.
- Wait. Really?

716
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:23,330
Nat, I don't wanna
split up, so...

717
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:24,765
Gavin'll meet us
on the other side, okay?

718
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,432
Yeah. He will be there.
I promise.

719
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,767
Okay?

720
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,836
Yeah. Love you.

721
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,037
See you in the Deadlands.

722
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,906

I hope she's okay.

726
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:38,847
Babe, she'll be fine.

727
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:41,985
Thank you.

728
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:57,530

729
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:14,013
Oh, okay. Hey!

730
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,716
Oh. Yummy.

731
00:37:15,718 --> 00:37:16,886
I don't like that.

732
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,019
Mmm-mmm.

733
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:21,488
Oh, my God! Wow!

734
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,356
- I'm so scared!
- Oh, shut up.

735
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,727
Crap!

736
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:28,997
Okay! Did you see the head
on that thing?

737
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:31,968
Jesus!

738
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,901
Fuck you, man!

739
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:37,506
Jesus Christ!

740
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:47,780
Shit!

741
00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:50,617
Okay. Great.

742
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:51,821
Well, there goes that mood.

743
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,142
Are you shitting me?

744
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,403
Hello?

Excuse me?

750
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,187
Do you know how long
this is gonna take?

751
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:38,024

00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,963

Security?

759
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,175
Help me!

760
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:31,211
Okay... What was that?

761
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,718
Yo, did you guys
hear that?

762
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,986
Yeah. It sounds like
Grade School freaking out.

763
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:43,589
No, she's not just
freaking out, that's beyond.

764
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:44,758
She's just getting into it.

765
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,559
See? Here we go. Oh.

766
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,258
<i>You are now
entering the Deadlands.</i>

767

00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,097
That's awesome.
That's brilliant.

769
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:26,098
- Are you kidding me?
- No! No, no, no!

770
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,700
Nat, it was part of the ride,
get it?

771
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,836
They fake breaking down

772
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:30,903
and then they climb in
with one of the single riders.

773
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,071
- That's awesome!
- This has been terrifying,

774
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,939
- you asshole.
- Terrifyingly awesome!

775
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,874
- No, it's pretty good.
- Nat. Relax.

776
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,310
Get that out of my...
I hate you all.

777
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:39,379
Dude.

778
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,585
Asher, Asher!

779
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,755
Oh, shit!

780
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:48,991
Ah, it's so cool!

781
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:52,292
What the fuck is this?

782
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:54,263
The hell is that?

783
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:57,930
Oh, shit!
That girl got wrecked!

784
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,698
I hope that washes out.

785
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,633
So, guys,

786
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:02,836
uh, what do we do?
Do we just wander around?

787
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:05,037
I don't know. I feel like
we should wait for Gavin.

788
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:07,006
All right, Nat, real talk.

789
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:08,374
I don't want
to ruin it for you.

790
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:10,343
But Gavin is out getting you

791
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,682
one of those stupid
stuffed animals.

792
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:15,180
He's just gonna take a while.

793
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:17,253
Because he sucks. Right?

794
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,452
Damn it. Really?

795
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,720
Yes, he likes you, okay? He's
gonna catch up when he does,

796
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:24,025
but we're here now. So let's
have some fun, all right?

797
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:25,959
Hey, guys...

798
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,327
I think we gotta
check this thing out.

799
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,928
He likes you

800
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,198
and we know he's not pooping.

801
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,100
Oh, that's nasty.

802
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,368
I think they're in there.

803
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,269
- Step up, Q.
- Yeah, nope.

804
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,238
- Go for it.
- No.

805
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,874
- No. No.
- What?

806
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:42,341
You're such a wuss, Q.

807
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,778
Yes.

808
00:42:46,048 --> 00:42:47,247
You okay, Ash?

809
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:48,381
Yeah.

810
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,816
- Then hurry up, man.
- You look good.

811
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,283
I'm good. Hold on.

812
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:53,252
Come on, baby.

813
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,292
That's gross.
That's in there.

814
00:42:59,294 --> 00:43:00,830
That's why
I didn't do it.

815
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:02,861
Okay. Hold on.

816
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:03,930
That's nasty.

817
00:43:03,932 --> 00:43:05,698
I think I got
something.

818
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,932
Does he always
make those noises?

819
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,801
- I'm almost there.
- You find it yet?

820
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:11,171
Oh, shit!

821
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:12,772
Oh, shit!

822
00:43:12,774 --> 00:43:14,707
Holy fuck!

823
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:15,975
- He got you!
- Look at your face.

824
00:43:15,977 --> 00:43:17,776
Shut the fuck up.
Take the stupid map.

825
00:43:17,778 --> 00:43:19,012
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!

826
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,345
- Okay. What the fuck?
- Hey!

827
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,381
Let me down!
What the fuck? Put me down!

828
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:23,716
Uh...

829
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:24,850
- What just happened?
- Asher!

830
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,919
I don't know.

831
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:27,720
I'm gonna need her back, dude!

832
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:28,990
Hey, Taylor.

833
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,223
Tay! Taylor!

834
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:33,193
I get touching somebody,

835
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,193
but picking them up
and taking them away

836
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,894
from their entire group
is kinda fucked up.

837
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:36,963
- Taylor!
- Tay!

838
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,430
I'm gonna barf.

839
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:40,432
That guy smelled like
a hobo's asshole.

840
00:43:40,434 --> 00:43:42,769
Wait, how do you know

841
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,336
what a hobo's asshole
smells like?

842
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:45,805
Because it smells
like Quinn's mom.

843
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:47,106
- Oh!
- Where did that guy take you?

844
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:48,742
I know, that's why I
know what I'm talking about.

845
00:43:48,744 --> 00:43:49,809
They smell so bad,
I'm gonna die.

846
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:50,812
Oh, shit.

847
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,493
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

848
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,265
Um... I guess
we're going with them.

849
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:13,899
It's all right.
We can do this.

850
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,936
Fuck.

851
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,537
Okay.

852
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,004
All right.

853
00:44:19,006 --> 00:44:20,275
- This is awesome!
- Hi.

854
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,910
Um, maybe somebody
should text Gavin.

855
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,144
- Guys!
- Oh, yeah, he's not...

856
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:26,981
Where the hell is he?

857
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,535
I can't see anything.

858
00:44:48,537 --> 00:44:49,839
I know.

859
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:58,477
Yo, this is dope.

860
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:02,048
<i>Welcome to your first trial.</i>

861
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,950
<i>Will you conquer your fears</i>

862
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,822
<i>or will your fears
conquer you?</i>

863
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,559
Oh.

864
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:15,260
Okay, bye.
Thanks for not killing us.

865
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,497
- That was creepy.
- Right?

866
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:19,899
Okay, guys, I think
this is the triple maze.

867
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:21,901
Sleep Like a Baby.
Very Bad Dreams.

868
00:45:21,903 --> 00:45:23,068
Your Worst Nightmare.

869
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,806
- Your Worst Nightmare!
- Sleep Like a Baby.

870
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:26,305
Tay, wait up.

871
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,573
We'll see you girls
on the other side.

872
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:29,477
Hope Gavin catches up. Whoo!

873
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,320
Flashlights?

874
00:45:40,187 --> 00:45:41,387
Whoa.

875
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:43,890
There is no way the girls' maze
is better than this one.

876
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:50,530
- Is that a baby face?
- Yeah, where is that...

877
00:45:50,532 --> 00:45:52,164
On the ass?

878
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:55,905
This is so gross.

879
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:08,184
Shit! Go, go, go!

880
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,526
Yo, yo. They changed.

881
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,528
How did it do that?

882
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,365
- The girl. Look at the girl.
- The veins.

883
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,566
- Whoa.
- Detail.

884
00:46:27,568 --> 00:46:29,102
This is gnarly.

885
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:31,473
Whoa.

886
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:35,878
Oh, now that is just awful.

887
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:50,356
Oh, shit!

888
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:52,193
Damn! She got me!

889
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,361
Listen, I'm not
going first anymore.

890
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:57,062
Go, Taylor. Stop laughing.

891
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,434
I don't wanna go first.

892
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:00,602
Go!

893
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:04,640
What?

894
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,178
- Whoa. Be careful.
- Okay, this is really cool.

895
00:47:13,481 --> 00:47:15,113
Dude...

896
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:16,716
That's crazy!

897
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:18,254
This is dope.

898
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,256
I like all the swirlies.

899
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,526
This is so dope.

900
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,129
Like, this is insane.

901
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:32,231
It's probably...

902
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:33,432
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

903
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,501
What is that? Oh!

904
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:37,135
Shut up, Taylor.

905
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:59,128
Oh, damn!

906
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,070
All right.

907
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:15,575
Just look at the hands.

908
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:16,709
Hey, Taylor,
you should go first.

909
00:48:16,711 --> 00:48:19,611
Oh. I hate you
so much right now.

910
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,213
- What if I just...
- No!

911
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,486
Just keeping you
on your toes.

912
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,657
Yay. That does
not look comfortable.

913
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,392
Okay, is it just me
or is it getting...

914
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:33,559
No, it's definitely
getting closer.

915
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:35,794
Yeah, but are the hands longer
or are the walls just...

916
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:36,696
Maybe both.

917
00:48:36,698 --> 00:48:38,231
The walls might be
closing in.

918
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:40,033
All I know is
think little thoughts.

919
00:48:40,035 --> 00:48:41,300
Think little thoughts.

920
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:42,801
All right, you know what?

921
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:45,104
First of all, woman.
Second of all, not that bad.

922
00:48:45,106 --> 00:48:46,205
Yeah.

923
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,613
Let me go!

924
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:03,458
Get off!

925
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,361
Wait! Brooke! Taylor!

926
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:08,493
Yo, man.

927
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,000
Yo, my flashlight
went out. What about you?

928
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,434
Mine too, dummy.

929
00:49:14,436 --> 00:49:15,368
Hurtful.

930
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,702
Q, it's probably a part
of the gimmick.

931
00:49:19,506 --> 00:49:21,807
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

932
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:23,575
That thing's not
slowing down, man.

933
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:25,778
- No. I know, I know...
- Oh, shit!

934
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,448
Ash! Wait up, man!

935
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:36,622
<i>Leave no bone unturned</i>

936
00:49:36,624 --> 00:49:41,196
<i>when looking for illumination
on the way out.</i>

937
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:47,432
Gross.

938
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:50,202
<i>Leave no bone unturned</i>

939
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,571

940
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,376

941

942
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:07,088

943

944
00:50:15,562 --> 00:50:19,668
<i>when looking for illumination

945
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:46,691
- Yo! What took you so long?
- That same fucking guy was in there.

946
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:47,792
- What guy?
- What are you talking about?

947
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:48,727
The guy!
The guy from Night Bumps.

948
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:50,463
Well, news flash,
he's been everywhere.

949
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,430
- Remember, we saw, like, 20.
- No! No, not that.

950
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:54,800
The guy that I was telling you
about before,

951
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,667
he was in there,
he was fucking taunting me.

952
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:57,702
He was banging
against the Plexiglas.

953
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:58,803
Nat. Hey.

954
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,539
Look,
when Asher gets out,

955
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:01,673
we'll go find someplace else.

956
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:02,841
Yeah. Just give him a second.

957
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:05,443
Knowing him, he's probably
having the time of his life.

958
00:51:09,216 --> 00:51:10,452
Quinn!

959
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,254
Quinn!

960
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:18,893
Q!

961
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:37,743
Oh, shit!

962
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,479
Just get the fuck off me!

963
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:13,447
The fuck?

964
00:52:21,622 --> 00:52:22,624
Stop!

965
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,396
No!

966
00:52:28,787 --> 00:52:30,685
Hey, it's okay.
Just breathe.

967
00:52:30,687 --> 00:52:32,422
I'm just, like, I'm done.

968
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:34,756
I know. You've made it through
the majority of the night.

969
00:52:34,758 --> 00:52:36,125
Of the fucking night?

970
00:52:36,127 --> 00:52:37,259
You've gotten through a lot,
all right?

971
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:38,393
Fuck!

972
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:39,731
Oh, shit!

973
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,623
Fuck me!

974
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:45,259
You got Brundlefly'd!

975
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:46,627
What the fuck is that?

976
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:49,197
That's awesome!

977
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,165
Well, that's kind of funny.

978
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,333
Oh, really?
It's your shirt, so, fuck you.

979
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,868
Damn! Shut up!

980
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,437
Let's go to the bathroom.

981
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:57,172
Oh, shit!

982
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,141
This isn't how
I wanted the night to go.

983
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,210
It's just been a long time
since I've seen you

984
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,779
and I wanted it to be
like it used to be.

985
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,315
I knew this place
was gonna be creepy,

986
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:07,882
I just didn't know
it was gonna be that intense.

987
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,153
Right.

988
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,386
But, hey, are you...

989
00:53:12,388 --> 00:53:13,424
Are you good?

990
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,560
I just worry about you.

991
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,326
And I love you.

992
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,164
And I miss you.

993
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,199
I love you, too.

994
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,268
I'm sorry I haven't
been around lately.

995
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,304
We gotta see each other more.

996
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,574
Let's go to Spain.

997
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:32,875
- You're not serious.
- I'm serious.

998
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,275
We've always talked about it.

999
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,476
- Let's just do it.
- You wanna go to Spain?

1000
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,545
Yeah, you said I need a break.

1001
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,181
You're probably right. So...

1002
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,449
You wanna go to the Prado
and get <i>tapas?</i>

1003
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,784
Sounds like you're saying
"topless," but...

1004
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,286
I mean, we can do that, too.

1005
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,687
You can do that. No thanks.

1006
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,223
We're going to Spain?

1007
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,259
- Yeah.
- You promise?

1008
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,496
I promise.

1009
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,364
Okay.

1010
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,364
Okay.

1011
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,699
I'll meet you out there.

1012
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,534
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1013
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,203
We're going to Spain.

1014
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,508
We're going topless in Spain.

1015
00:55:45,908 --> 00:55:47,711
Ugh. Gross.

1016
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,573
I'm calling the cops!

1017
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,011
Fuck!

1018
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:30,772
Brooke.

1019
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:31,873
What?

1020
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,942
What's wrong?

1021
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,212
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you. It's empty.

1022
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,214
No, I'm telling you
that he was just here!

1023
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,148
I just had to crawl under this
thing to get away from him!

1024
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,717
- He was grabbing at me!
- All right, look...

1025
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,884
I know the scarers
aren't supposed

1026
00:58:43,886 --> 00:58:44,752
to be in the bathroom,

1027
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:45,619
but if you can't even
identify him,

1028
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:47,922
I don't know what
you want me to do.

1029
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,757
I don't know. Shut down
the park. Call the cops.

1030
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,726
- Do something other than this!
- Are you hurt?

1031
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,062
- What?
- Did he physically hurt you?

1032
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,830
I mean, he grabbed at me.
I'm not injured.

1033
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,833
Unless there is
an actionable charge,

1034
00:58:57,835 --> 00:58:59,801
- there's nothing I can do.
- What?

1035
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:01,569
No, you're not understanding
a thing that I'm saying!

1036
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,804
This guy has been stalking us
since the second we got here!

1037
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,473
- Which guy?
- The guy with the mask

1038
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,609
from the Night Bumps ride!

1039
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:09,610
You just described 15 people
that work in this park.

1040
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,212
You know how many complaints
I get like this a night?

1041
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,580
Great. Well, mine's valid,

1042
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:13,748
so what are you gonna
do with that?

1043
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,119
- Holy shit!
- What?

1044
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,020
It's the photos
of you and Gavin.

1045
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,621
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, no, no, wait.

1046
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:21,723
Who's Gavin?

1047
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,623
He's our friend that was

1048
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,991
supposed to meet us,
like, an hour ago.

1049
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,092
He must have Gavin's phone.

1050
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:28,529
Yeah, I think your friend,
Gavin, is pranking you.

1051
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,830
All right, look,

1052
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,600
you came here
to be scared, right?

1053
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:34,235
I can't arrest people
for doing their job.

1054
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,772
Welcome to Hell Fest.

1055
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,176
We've got to find him.

1056
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,578
Quinn. Quinn, we need to go.

1057
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,779
- Now.
- What?

1058
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,114
- We need to go. Now.
- Why would we leave?

1059
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,781
I'll tell you later.
Where's Asher?

1060
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:48,917
I haven't seen him.

1061
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,587
Then where's Taylor?

1062
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:53,221
She volunteered.

1063
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,683
Welcome,

1064
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:27,054
children of the night!

1065
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,058
Are you ready to leave

1066
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,826
the land of the living

1067
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,060
and enter

1068
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:35,830
into the darkness?

1069
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:40,203
Into the world of monsters?

1070
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,571
Whoo!

1071
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:46,308
In order to open up
the gates of Hell,

1072
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,344
we must spill the blood of...

1073
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,045
Wait for it,

1074
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,183
wait for it,

1075
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,784
a virgin.

1076
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:03,223
So, about that
whole virgin thing,

1077
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:04,826
I think we might have
a problem.

1078
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,328
What is your name, child?

1079
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,330
Taylor Ann Smythe, your honor.

1080
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,799
You're accused of doing
the Devil's work.

1081
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,033
What say you?

1082
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,668
- Totally did it.
- And what are your crimes?

1083
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,937
Well, how long
do you have?

1084
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:18,205
'Cause I've actually done laps
around the seven deadly sins.

1085
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,875
Oh! Impressive.

1086
01:01:21,877 --> 01:01:25,013
But you must pay
for your transgressions.

1087
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,016
Ooh, what is it?

1088
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,882
Your head.

1089
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:31,187
Ooh.

1090
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,192
Executioner!

1091
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,229
Yeah!

1092
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,201
Oh. Okay. Well, bye-bye.

1093
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:48,005
- Something's not right.
- What?

1094
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,741
Something's not right.

1095
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:54,844
What do you mean?

1096
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,013
Yeah!

1097
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,228
That's him.

1098
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,730
That's him.

1099
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,964
Wait, the guy
from the bathroom?

1100
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,266
Yeah, that's...

1101
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,235
That's him. Oh, God! Taylor!

1102
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,272
Nat, wait!

1103
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:40,757
Taylor!

1104
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:42,993
Taylor!

1105
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:56,740
Nat, it's okay.
It's okay.

1106
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:04,782
Oh, my God,
that was so much fun!

1107
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,449
Hell Fest!

1108
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:14,992
Hey, can someone get me
out of this thing?

1109
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:17,357
Hey, you got her?

1110
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,195
Please exit
the stage area.

1111
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,967
Oh, hey. Sorry about the, uh,

1112
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,301
screaming girl.

1113
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,002
Yeah, that's my best friend's
best friend.

1114
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:31,371
She doesn't really get horror,
so...

1115
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,877
What can you do?

1116
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,114
Can you get me out?

1117
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,185
Please?

1118
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,790
Yes! Awesome, thank you.

1119
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,458
Ow! What the hell, man?

1120
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,259
I said out, not forward.

1121
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,427
Ow!

1122
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,063
And not tighter. Dude, did you
just skip training day?

1123
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:58,533
'Cause you're really
not doing this right. It's...

1124
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:01,069
Okay, that's really tight.

1125
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:02,402
This isn't a funny joke.

1126
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:04,038
Ow! Okay.

1127
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,973
Jesus, can you not hear
when I say "Ow"?

1128
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,107
This is not comfortable.

1129
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:08,912
Ow!

1130
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,846
Okay, too tight.

1131
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,047
This is really not funny.
I don't like this.

1132
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:15,285
This is really uncomfortable.

1133
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,096
Brooke!

1134
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,295
Quinn!

1135
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,165
Somebody help me!

1136
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,299
Are you happy now?

1137
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:33,101
'Cause now we're gonna have
to call the cops on you.

1138
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,536
Yeah, no, that's exactly what
I want you to do!

1139
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:35,770
Two of our friends
are missing!

1140
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,404
No, two of your friends are
somewhere in the park, drunk.

1141
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,473
No, they're not!

1142
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:39,477
Help me!

1143
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,844
Shit! Quinn!

1144
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,248
Come on!

1145
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,449
Oh, my God, someone help!

1146
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:53,223
Help me!

1147
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,273
Help me, please!

1148
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,440
Please help me! Please!

1149
01:06:20,442 --> 01:06:23,043
- Help me!
- You suck at this shit!

1150
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,913
- Guys, I think it's Taylor.
- Who's...

1151
01:06:24,915 --> 01:06:26,617
- Hey, where are you...
- Fuck out of my way!

1152
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:30,051
We got a situation
in the Deadlands.

1153
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:31,551
He's trying to
kill me! Get out of the way!

1154
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:32,987
Get out of the way!

1155
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,554
Somebody, help me,
please! Help me!

1156
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:35,556
Please help me! Please!

1157
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,125
Get out of the way,
he's trying to kill me!

1158
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,330
What are you doing? Don't...

1159
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,600
Hey, man, what are you doing?

1160
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,477
- Quinn, Quinn!
- Brooke. Brooke. Brooke!

1161
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:59,980
- Quinn! No!
- We gotta go.

1162
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,451
Brooke, we gotta go.

1163
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,170
Get down on the ground!

1164
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,107
We got him! Got him!

1165
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,485
- Nat! Are you okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

1166
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,457
<i>Please find the nearest exit.</i>

1167
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,503
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on, we gotta go.

1168
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,204
<i>Due to unforeseen
circumstances</i>

1169
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,539

1170
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,011

<i>the park will be closing.</i>

1173
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,423
- Nat, over here.
- Okay.

1174
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,493
I think
this is an exit.

1175
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:25,400
<i>You are
at the entrance to Hell.</i>

1176
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,502
It's another maze.

1177
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,472
<i>Welcome to Hell.</i>

1178
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:32,673
<i>Can you make it out
the other side?</i>

1179
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,345
We gotta go, we gotta go.

1180
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:41,518
<i>Welcome to Hell.</i>

1181
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:58,432

1188
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,060
Wait!

1189
01:09:58,595 --> 01:10:00,895
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What?

1190
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:03,463
Look, these are triggering
the rooms.

1191
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,165
This is what's making
the noise.

1192
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,601
- Come with me.
- No. Nat.

1193
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:07,735
Brooke, I'm telling you...

1194
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:08,902
We gotta go that way.

1195
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,607
Shh, listen, you have
to trust me, okay?

1196
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,273
Listen. We have to go.

1197
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,842
Come.

1198
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:16,377
Okay, come on.

1199
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,181
Come on.
There's a closet back here.

1200
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:32,560
I can't get reception.

1201
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,796
Me neither.

1202
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,568
It's not working.

1203
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,661
Okay.

1204
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:19,710
Come on, come on, come on.

1205
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,632

01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,106
No.

1208
01:11:52,108 --> 01:11:55,445
No, this can't be happening.
No, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

1209
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,012
Please, somebody, help!
Please! Please!

1210
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,950
We're gonna have
to go through, okay?

1211
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:07,254
Listen. Shh! We're gonna
have to go through.

1212
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,559
We can do this.
Together, okay?

1213
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,525
Okay. Okay.

1214
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,497
- We can do this.
- Okay.

1215
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:16,832
We gotta go.

1216
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,431
Fuck.
It's all fake.

1217
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,610
Brooke.

1218
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,614
Okay. Okay. You okay?

1219
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:07,981
Yeah.

1220
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:09,917
We can do this.

1221
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:11,321
- Okay.
- Okay.

1222
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,438
We left that open.

1223
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,044
We left that door open.

1224
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,692
He's not in here.

1225
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,862
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

1226
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,333
Okay. Okay.

1227
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,738
<i>Don't
look at their faces, Mommy.</i>

1228
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:38,138
More dolls.

1229
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,673
Let's just get the fuck
out of here.

1230
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,580
<i>Don't look
at their faces, Mommy.</i>

1231
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:49,749
<i>Don't look
at their faces, Mommy.</i>

1232
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,390
Brooke!

1233
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,657
It's a dead end.
It's a dead end.

1234
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,115
<i>Clever, clever.</i>

1235
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,786
<i>You've found the hidden path</i>

1236
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:05,654
<i>to Hell.</i>

1237
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,660
<i>Clever, clever.</i>

1238
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:16,533
<i>You've found the hidden path
to Hell.</i>

1239
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,350
Brooke, go!

1240
01:18:52,028 --> 01:18:53,029
No!

1241
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:03,607
Brooke?

1242
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,056
Nat! Help me, please!

1243
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,309
Please, no, please!

1244
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,744
Why are you doing this?

1245
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:46,780
Please, please,
why are you doing this?

1246
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,284
I won't tell anybody!
Please!

1247
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,120
No! Wait, wait!
Please!

1248
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,324
No!

1249
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,163
Go to Hell!

1250
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:18,011
Hey, back up!

1251
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,512
He was
right behind us.

1252
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:01,357
We looked everywhere,
but we couldn't find him.

1253
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,294
Wait, what?

1254
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:08,765
No, no, no,
he was right there.

1255
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,502
Don't worry. We're gonna
keep looking, okay?

1256
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,080
<i>They're gonna find him.</i>

1257
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:30,183
<i>Tragedy at Hell Fest tonight.</i>

1258
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:31,919
<i>Police believe
that the suspect</i>

1259
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,920
<i>may have entered
the park anonymously</i>

1260
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,222
<i>with the rest
of the attendees.</i>

1261
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,456
<i>Four fatalities
have been confirmed</i>

1262
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,392
<i>with two of the bodies
being hidden</i>

1263
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,928
<i>within mazes inside the park.</i>

1264
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:44,231
<i>All of this leads police
to connect tonight's murders</i>

1265
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,900
<i>to the killing of a girl
at an Orange Grove haunt</i>

1266
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,569
<i>just a few years ago.</i>

1267
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,340
<i>If you're just tuning in,
tragedy...</i>

1268
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,485
Daddy, you're home!

1269
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:13,488
Did you bring me anything?
