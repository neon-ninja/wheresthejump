1
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:21,297
Even serial killers live
next door to somebody.

2
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:29,374
Tough pill to swallow,
I know, but it"s true.

3
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,393
If I"ve learned anything,

4
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:42,111
it"s that people hardly ever let
you know who they really are.

5
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:49,922
Just past the manicured
lawns and friendly waves,

6
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:54,789
inside any house, even
the one next door,

7
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:58,230
anything could be happening
and you"d never know.

8
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,661
And that"s the thing
about this place.

9
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:08,009
It all might seem
normal and routine,

10
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:12,451
but the truth is the suburbs are
where the craziest shit happens.

11
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:18,078
You never know what might be
coming around the corner.

12
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:26,993
Davey.

13
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:28,616
Hey bud, what"s going on?

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,169
Oh, hey Mr. Mackey.

15
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:31,136
Hey.

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,309
Oh, thank you.

17
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,621
What"s with all the dirt?

18
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:35,525
I"ve been doing a little
planting in the garden.

19
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,389
Um, there was no cash in
your mailbox yesterday

20
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:38,764
for the paper.

21
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:39,908
Has it been a month already?

22
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:40,490
Yeah.

23
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,629
Jeez.

24
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:42,630
Uh, ok.

25
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:43,934
Well, actually I
was going to ask

26
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,840
if you could help me
lift something inside

27
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,255
if you have a second.

28
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:47,980
I"ll get the money then.

29
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:48,981
Two birds, one stone?

30
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,189
Ok, sure.

31
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:52,778
Great.

32
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:54,493
After you.

33
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:12,028
I knew I had it.

34
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,490
There you go.

35
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,516
Thank you.

36
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:21,186
You got a big family, huh?

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,533
Yeah, I guess so.

38
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:26,052
Just uh, you know, make sure
you don"t live too close

39
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:29,504
to them or they"ll come knocking
on your door every day.

40
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:30,505
Alright, this is it.

41
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:31,809
Some new furniture for upstairs,

42
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,553
so I gotta get this hunk
of junk downstairs.

43
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:34,700
Think we can manage it?

44
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:35,510
Uh, yeah.

45
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,880
Sure.

46
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,411
Alright?

47
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,308
Here we go.

48
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:41,240
Ok.

49
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:41,896
It is heavy.

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,232
Yeah.

51
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:45,372
Watch your step.

52
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,098
Here, let me try that way.

53
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,378
There we go.

54
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:57,774
Woah!

55
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:58,740
Jesus.

56
00:02:58,764 --> 00:02:59,362
You ok?

57
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:00,190
Uh, yeah.

58
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:00,880
Yeah, shit.

59
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:01,536
Sorry.

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,882
That"s ok.

61
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:03,573
As long as it didn"t get
your foot or anything.

62
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:04,539
You alright?

63
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:06,023
Yeah.

64
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:07,335
Why don"t we just take a break?

65
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,602
Ok.

66
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:13,790
Sorry about that.

67
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:16,517
Damn water heater just keeps
getting louder and louder.

68
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,277
Gotta get a new one.

69
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:21,107
Flip side of not living
near any family is

70
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,549
never anyone around
to lend a hand.

71
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:28,553
Hey, I uh, I really appreciate
you helping me out.

72
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,910
Uh, what"s in there?

73
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,214
Well, that is where
we"re headed.

74
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:33,878
Think you can make it
the rest of the way?

75
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,497
Yeah.

76
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:39,471
Heavy son of a bitch, huh?

77
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:41,473
Yeah.

78
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:45,270
I am putting the finishing
touches on my dark room.

79
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:48,411
So I"m an amateur photographer.

80
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:51,414
I figured that this piece
could store some equipment.

81
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,174
Yeah, it"s cool.

82
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:56,626
Um, I"m sort of an amateur
videographer, so I get it.

83
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,939
Just like the old man.

84
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:01,963
My god, I remember when
your parents would push you

85
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,633
around the block
in the stroller.

86
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:06,118
Now look at you.

87
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:06,843
How old are you, anyway?

88
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:07,775
15.

89
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,294
15.

90
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:10,950
That"s the perfect age.

91
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:14,782
I wish I could just
freeze it for you.

92
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,784
Uh, well, I gotta go.

93
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:17,336
Yeah.

94
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,854
Yeah.

95
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:18,579
Of course.

96
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:19,269
Go ahead.

97
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,132
Thank you for this.

98
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,029
I will, uh, take it from here.

99
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:21,823
Give your family my best?

100
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,366
I will.

101
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,524
Manhunt!

102
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,457
I am going to get you shitheads!

103
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,379
I'm going to find you.

104
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:52,475
Farraday?

105
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,510
Find your own spot.

106
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:54,200
You"re gonna get us both caught.

107
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:55,305
This is my spot.

108
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,030
Not anymore.

109
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:57,342
Now go!

110
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,828
Fine. Go.

111
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:02,336
Jesus.

112
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:21,366
Gotcha, dudes!

113
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,574
Christ, guys!

114
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,507
Hiding in Farraday"s spot, man?

115
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,266
Lame.

116
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,405
You"re better than that.

117
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:28,718
Treehouse in 15, after
we catch this bitch?

118
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:29,995
He"s close.

119
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:32,100
I can practically smell
the Noxell on him.

120
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:47,426
Vaginas are magical.

121
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,773
I can"t wait to get laid.

122
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:52,258
Aren"t you guys tired of
looking at those same chicks?

123
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:53,605
Shit no, man.

124
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,366
Or even just feel up a chick.

125
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,678
Second base?

126
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:59,024
That"s it?

127
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:00,370
I rounded third once.

128
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,716
She was hot, too.

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,856
Oh, it just so happens to
be a chick none of us know.

130
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,755
It was on vacation, dipshit.

131
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,309
I"d just be happy to get
on any base with Nikki.

132
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,931
In your dreams, Davey.

133
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,761
Yeah, wet dreams.

134
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,590
"How is she so frikken" hot?

135
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,937
Too bad she"s into my brother.

136
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:17,387
Kyle?

137
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,768
No way.

138
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,425
He"s like twenty and he
works at a hardware store.

139
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,702
You think Kyle"s a dick?

140
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:23,773
My asshole father wants
to tear this thing down.

141
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:24,877
What?

142
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,327
Ser-seriously?

143
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:27,604
No, man.

144
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,434
Can"t he at least wait
until we go to college?

145
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,883
Eats, I need this place.

146
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,885
Shit, I would live
up here if I could.

147
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,094
I mean, I don"t know how
safe that would be.

148
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:35,785
With the...

149
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:36,441
What?

150
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:37,442
Kids going missing.

151
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,444
Ok, here we go.

152
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:40,997
What?

153
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,308
Come on.

154
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:43,972
I mean, we all know
what you"re gonna say.

155
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:44,897
It"s a conspiracy.

156
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,243
It"s all connected.

157
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,107
The missing kids aren"t
random, they"re part of

158
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:52,422
some vast governmental
alien cover-up, right?

159
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,356
So you don"t think it's weird?

160
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,497
Look, last summer a kid
goes missing in Hazelton.

161
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,490
Now another kid
disappears in Freeport?

162
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:05,815
Uh, Davey, I love you man

163
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,196
but uh, you do kinda
sound like a schitzoid.

164
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,475
Remember when he connected a
Lite-Brite to his keyboard

165
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:14,306
to try and communicate with
the extraterrestrials?

166
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,570
Or when he swore there was a
demonic presence in his room

167
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:18,883
because our houses were built
on Indian burial grounds?

168
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,486
That was, like, three years ago.

169
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,695
And our houses were built
on Indian burial grounds.

170
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,628
Davey, there"s literally
no proof of that.

171
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:26,491
Yes, there is.

172
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:27,112
No, there"s not.

173
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,285
Are we done here?

174
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,989
I gotta beat off before
my parents get home

175
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:31,150
and W.W. III breaks out.

176
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:32,531
Good call.

177
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,555
I"m gonna go make a withdrawal
from the spank bank.

178
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,810
You guys are animals.

179
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,009
Yes you are.

180
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,356
Woah.

181
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,269
Wait, I thought you were sick
of looking at the same chicks.

182
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:45,371
I am.

183
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,201
Why do you think I stopped
banging your mom?

184
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:48,064
You are so dead.

185
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:48,616
Oh yeah?

186
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,824
Oh yeah?

187
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:51,170
Give me the magazine.

188
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:52,554
I"m pretty sure
this is non-lethal.

189
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:54,822
This is my magazine!

190
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,750
You should not read this
stuff before bedtime.

191
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:19,820
Mom, I"m fifteen.

192
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:20,993
Mmmhmm.

193
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,457
You don"t have to
tuck me in anymore.

194
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:23,927
Maybe you don"t need me to,

195
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:27,517
doesn"t mean I'm
ready to give it up.

196
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,692
You think dad"s
coming home soon?

197
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:30,658
I don"t know, hon.

198
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,004
You know how the news is.

199
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:37,182
Always something going
on that needs reporting.

200
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,449
Ok, sleep tight.

201
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:57,789
Hey guys, Ipswich
Lanes tomorrow?

202
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:58,790
Scope some cuties?

203
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:00,274
I"m in.

204
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,379
I hope that chick from
last week is there.

205
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,140
She was all over me.

206
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:05,313
You asked to touch her boobs

207
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,697
and she threw you
over the railing.

208
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,385
Bet I don"t look half
as dumb as Davey

209
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,215
every time he sees
Nikki in the DJ booth

210
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,251
and jizzes in his pants.

211
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,046
Oh yeah?

212
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,462
Well, I can see her right now.

213
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,430
Naked.

214
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:20,501
Bullshit.

215
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:24,125
Dude, if you"re
serious, I hate you.

216
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,059
Oh my god, she"s waving
for me to come over.

217
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,337
Ok, now I know
you"re full of shit.

218
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,122
Eats out.

219
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:34,791
I"d easily trade both my
nuts to have the view.

220
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,413
Ok, genius.

221
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,477
If you"ve got no balls what's
the point of the view?

222
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,262
You"d just be some
ball-less perv.

223
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,659
Can you at least
make mom double-bag

224
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:16,212
her meatloaf next time?

225
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,110
It smells like werewolf crap.

226
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,454
Well, if you would
have remembered

227
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,398
to put the cinder blocks
back on the garbage cans

228
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:25,773
like I told you we
wouldn"t have this mess.

229
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,223
I hate raccoons.

230
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,777
You should do an exclusive,
get pest control in here.

231
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:30,985
I could film it.

232
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,366
Camcorder"s off limits, pal.

233
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,817
Station property, you know that.

234
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,641
How am I supposed to
become the next Spielberg

235
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,061
if I don"t practice?

236
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,029
Nice try.

237
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,573
Just uh, make sure
the driveway"s clean

238
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,895
before you go anywhere.

239
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,586
Capisce, Spielberg?

240
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,313
Whatever.

241
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:44,576
Guys.

242
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,059
Guys.

243
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,440
Dude, what?

244
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:48,580
Those are the Pacific Grove
Babes from last week.

245
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:50,271
Get off of me, you psycho!

246
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:51,583
I can"t.

247
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,989
I got needs, Woody.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,048
Nikki fucking Kazsuba.

249
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:11,085
She"s, like, scientifically
the perfect woman.

250
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,916
If she was my babysitter I"d
have been banging her the day

251
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,158
my balls dropped.

252
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:16,297
Yeah, was it hard
not to get a boner

253
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,561
when she was giving you a bath?

254
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:18,403
Jesus, guys.

255
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:19,611
It was, like, four years ago.

256
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:20,992
Not ten.

257
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,132
We just played games and shit.

258
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,927
What kinda games?

259
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:25,824
Naughty games?

260
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:27,826
I hate you guys so much.

261
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,590
It is now confirmed

262
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,178
that 14 Eastern Bloc countries,

263
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:38,250
including the Soviet Union,
will boycott the Olympic games

264
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,770
in Los Angeles
later this summer.

265
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,914
Only Romania and Yugoslavia
will remain in attendance.

266
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,463
Unbelievable.

267
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,639
The Cold War"s never gonna end.

268
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:49,848
Your future is dim, Davey.

269
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:51,643
Ok.

270
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,107
John dropped these
off for you today.

271
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,340
It must be the fliers
for the Bay Festival.

272
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,055
Mmmhmm.

273
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:02,965
Oh.

274
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:04,311
Come on.

275
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,295
They got some crummy synth
band playing this year.

276
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,970
Nikki"s not DJ-ing
like last year?

277
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,281
She"s amazing.

278
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:10,825
Well, with her parents
getting divorced

279
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,733
it wasn"t really
in the cards, pal.

280
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,839
Nikki"s parents are
getting divorced?

281
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,461
Where did you hear that?

282
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:17,842
Bob Burnqvist.

283
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,188
He bowls with Mike Kaszuba.

284
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,706
Apparently it"s pretty ugly,

285
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,810
supposedly Mike"s not even
staying at home right now.

286
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,539
Let"s not gossip, Randall.

287
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:26,954
But that is awful.

288
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:29,058
I never would have thought
they were having problems.

289
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,153
That"s why they
invented curtains, hon.

290
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:56,363
Hey, Randall, it"s Jimmy.

291
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,710
Listen, uh, this is
going to sound crazy.

292
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,534
The Chronicle received
a letter from some guy

293
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,748
calling himself the
Cape May Slayer.

294
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:05,096
This guy claims he"s killed
at least 13 teenaged boys

295
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,442
over the last decade.

296
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:07,581
Oh my god!

297
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,548
Are you sure this isn"t a hoax?

298
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:10,722
No, it's... it's legit, man.

299
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,106
The story"s gonna
break any second.

300
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,449
We need you in here pronto.

301
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:15,544
I"m on my way.

302
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:22,907
Guys, something big
is going down.

303
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:24,529
Someone"s going down on who?

304
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:25,944
No, I was right.

305
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,118
You know those missing boys?

306
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,913
It"s a serial killer.

307
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:31,053
My dad just got called in.

308
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:31,881
Holy shit!

309
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:32,882
You"re not kidding.

310
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,632
It"s on the news right now.

311
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:38,750
This afternoon the
Cape May Chronicle

312
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:41,235
received a letter
from an individual

313
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,617
calling themselves
the Cape May Slayer,

314
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:45,619
claiming responsibility for
the deaths of at least

315
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:50,106
13 teenaged boys along
with two adults.

316
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,316
The author also provided
a list of names, dates,

317
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,078
and pertinent details
related to a number of

318
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:58,804
open missing persons cases.

319
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,807
We have confirmed the
accuracy of these statements.

320
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:04,500
I can now officially
label this person

321
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:07,330
as an active serial killer.

322
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:09,781
The sheriff"s office reports
they're likely looking for

323
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:13,336
a white male in his late
30"s to 40"s living alone.

324
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,708
Preferred targets appear
to be males aged 12 to 16-

325
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,345
I can"t believe
something like this

326
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:24,106
Could actually happen here.

327
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,624
It could be anyone.

328
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:27,419
This is the coolest thing
that"s ever happened to us.

329
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:29,111
Didn"t they say he
hunts guys our age?

330
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,147
Should we cool it with
the late night manhunt?

331
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,631
Why?

332
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,775
None of the missing kids are
from Ipswich and Cape May

333
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,945
"is pretty frikken" big.

334
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:36,981
It"s not that big.

335
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:37,982
What is it, nine towns?

336
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,811
It"s ten towns.

337
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,155
Guys, how are you
not freaking out

338
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,815
that something"s finally
happening here?

339
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,817
Because there"s no way
it"s gonna hit us.

340
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:48,337
Or this neighbourhood.

341
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,442
Dude, look at this place.

342
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,203
You"re desperate for
crazy shit to happen.

343
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:54,619
There"s a serial
killer on the loose.

344
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:56,966
What else could possibly
be this exciting?

345
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,555
Incoming titties, 12:00!

346
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,236
Holy shit!

347
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,559
Move over, Woody!

348
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,664
Dude.

349
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,736
If I was over there right
now she"d be pregnant.

350
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,325
Show her a little respect, ok?

351
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:14,397
Her parents are
getting divorced.

352
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,849
Statistically, that means
she"s, like, 78 percent

353
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:19,747
more likely to engage
in pre-marital sex.

354
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,404
You guys are disgusting.

355
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:22,474
Whatever, dude.

356
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,544
You were thinking it.

357
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,753
Bank it and spank it, boys.

358
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,607
Please turn around, please.

359
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:31,759
Shit! Get down!

360
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,727
Dude!

361
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,005
Fuck!

362
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,720
Oh, I"m so fucked.

363
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:43,599
Oh, Davey... you're...
you"re a really bad kisser.

364
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:44,669
What?

365
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,015
I"m-I'm sorry, Nikki, I-what?

366
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:46,602
Guys!

367
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:48,742
Cut the shit!

368
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:51,572
Unlike you idiots I actually
come here to study.

369
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:54,634
So don"t get me kicked out!

370
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:57,889
Check it out.

371
00:16:57,913 --> 00:16:59,166
Cape May Slayer.

372
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,548
Fifteen confirmed victims
and still counting.

373
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:03,101
So rad.

374
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,378
I don"t get it.

375
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,162
Why would the killer
only write a letter now,

376
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:07,554
after all this time?

377
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:10,039
He"s been killing people and
getting away with it for years.

378
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,800
He"s bored so he's
raising the stakes.

379
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,068
He wasn"t counting on us.

380
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,670
Jesus, Farraday, it"s not
like you"re gonna break it!

381
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,041
Peek-a-boobs!

382
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:01,183
Get it?

383
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,093
What the hell are you doing?

384
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,257
Free porn, bro.

385
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,779
Is he just gonna take that?

386
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:36,125
Yo, where the hell"s Sammy?

387
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,816
We need him or we
don"t have numbers.

388
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,163
I dunno.

389
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:41,855
We haven"t heard from
him in a few days.

390
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,960
"The Hoffmans" car's
in the driveway.

391
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:45,307
They must be home.

392
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,516
Let"s go get the little shit.

393
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,174
Woody, stay with
these dickweeds.

394
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:52,303
This way, dickweeds.

395
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,747
No movement.

396
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,231
Or lights.

397
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,405
Oh well.

398
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,165
Oh well?

399
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,479
No one"s seen Sammy in days.

400
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:20,100
What if-

401
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:21,377
Don't even say it.

402
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:23,103
He"s probably up at the
lake or some shit.

403
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:26,589
Why is their car here?

404
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,557
Maybe they rented one?

405
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:29,316
Why would they-

406
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,076
Who cares?

407
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,980
Ok, the real issue is that
we don"t have numbers

408
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:36,220
"cause of the little prick
so now I can"t play manhunt.

409
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:38,142
Whatever, I"m out.

410
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:42,560
Yeah, sorry Davey, I got
a book to finish anyway.

411
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,937
Congrats.

412
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:13,627
You"re getting your calcium.

413
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:14,628
So what?

414
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:17,321
Mackey is the Cape May Slayer.

415
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:22,153
Uh... I knew we shouldn't have
taken you to the library, Davey.

416
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:22,981
I blame myself.

417
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:23,982
I also blame Farraday.

418
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:25,018
No man, look.

419
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,537
Who"s the missing ginger?

420
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,281
That"s the kid I saw in
Mackey"s dining room

421
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,298
a few weeks ago.

422
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,482
When we were playing manhunt.

423
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,276
Redheads all look the same.

424
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,646
So true.

425
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,630
Well, if you"re so sure
it's him why don"t you uh,

426
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:35,994
just tell your parents?

427
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:38,307
Because they"d never believe me.

428
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,811
Guys, I was only,
like, ten feet away.

429
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:41,345
I saw him clear as day.

430
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,554
That"s him.

431
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,452
Plus, what about the Hoffmans?

432
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,351
Their lake house is only
a couple hours north,

433
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,249
but their car"s still here?

434
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,492
And they"re neighbours.

435
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:51,700
So?

436
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:53,805
What if one Hoffman saw
Mackey with Dusty?

437
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:54,496
Who?

438
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,566
The missing ginger.

439
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,150
Mackey found out somehow
and killed them

440
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:58,327
to get rid of the threat.

441
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,018
Eats, tell them what Kyle said.

442
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,226
Farraday, what the fuck?

443
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,849
What did Kyle say?

444
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:03,884
Goddammit.

445
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,541
Fine.

446
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:07,965
Um, he said that Mackey goes to
the hardware store every week

447
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:09,683
and buys, like, 100
pounds of dirt,

448
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,409
says it"s for his garden.

449
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,479
Bullshit!

450
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,378
Who uses 100 pounds
of dirt a week

451
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,345
in a backyard garden?

452
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,169
You know, he"s also got
a room in his basement

453
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,555
with a padlock on the door.

454
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,247
Why would he need that?

455
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:24,595
Still not convinced?

456
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:26,424
"Suspect is likely
a white male,"

457
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:29,013
"late 30's to 40's,
lives alone."

458
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:30,290
Who does that remind you of?

459
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:33,431
Dude, Mackey"s a cop
with a sick reputation.

460
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,020
That"s why it's so genius.

461
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:37,401
He knows police tactics.

462
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:40,024
He can plant evidence
to throw them off,

463
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:42,371
or destroy it if they
ever find anything bad.

464
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,786
And who would suspect a cop?

465
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,410
It"s the perfect cover.

466
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:48,135
Guys, if Mackey is
what I think he is

467
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,689
then we gotta do something.

468
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:51,518
Ok, Magnum P.I.

469
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,727
What"s your plan?

470
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:58,387
Well, we have to find out the
truth and be able to prove it.

471
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:02,460
We need real, hard evidence.

472
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,082
Which means...

473
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:05,049
Stake-out?

474
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:06,982
Search and destroy.

475
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,915
Who"s with me?

476
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:11,296
This is bat shit crazy.

477
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,332
I"m in.

478
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:16,118
Operation Mack
Attack starts now.

479
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:23,412
He leaves his house every
weekday at 8:24 with a gym bag.

480
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,369
Contents unknown.

481
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:31,834
He gets home from work at
6:25 with that same bag.

482
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,905
Goes in through the garage
and closes it behind him.

483
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,759
He always closes it.

484
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:40,843
His weekends are all
over the place.

485
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,949
No patter.

486
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:43,950
Except that he gardens.

487
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,665
A lot.

488
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:48,161
Acidity in the soil
must be off, though,

489
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:50,359
plants look like shit.

490
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,275
He has dinner alone every
night at 8:30-ish,

491
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,968
then probably wanks it and
cries himself to sleep.

492
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:03,970
Loser.

493
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,662
Well, no, because most nights
he goes for a jog at 11:00

494
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:08,940
for about an hour.

495
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,148
Not sure where he goes

496
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:12,623
but we should
definitely find out.

497
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:19,330
Now that we know his schedule,
what do we do next?

498
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:22,461
We catch this fucker
and become heroes.

499
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,233
Farraday, you"re retarded.

500
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,217
You think a bunch of glorified
Care Bears in hoods

501
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,513
could take down the empire?

502
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:31,687
They are aliens and they"re
highly intelligent!

503
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:34,138
I mean, did you see how fast
that one learned to drive

504
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:36,562
a speeder bike, and then ditch
it without even being spotted?

505
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:37,659
Whatever, dude.

506
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:38,867
They"re bears.

507
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:40,869
Now, if it was Gremlins,
I"d buy it maybe.

508
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:43,147
I"ve still gotta see Gremlins.

509
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:45,356
Hey, maybe you
should take Nikki.

510
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,359
She can find out what happens
if she gets your Mogwai wet.

511
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:50,383
Farraday, stick to shit
that could actually happen.

512
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,110
Like me fathering a
sibling for Woody.

513
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:56,194
Dude, I told you to stop
talking about my mom.

514
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:57,644
Would you rather I acted it out?

515
00:24:57,668 --> 00:24:59,548
No, I"d rather you just
not talk about anything-

516
00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:01,229
Shit, Mackey"s back!

517
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,046
Let"s break into his garage.

518
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,702
No.

519
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:21,254
We can"t do that.

520
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:21,910
He"s a cop.

521
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,083
Hey guys.

522
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,948
Look, at 11:00 he"s
gonna go for a run.

523
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:28,250
Trust me, I"ve got a plan.

524
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:38,295
Guys.

525
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:41,585
What the hell are we doing?

526
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,965
His fucking trash?

527
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:44,588
Are you kidding me?

528
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:45,623
What?

529
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:47,127
Look, there could be
evidence in here.

530
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:48,714
Fingers or bloody
rags or something.

531
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:51,595
If we find anything, we got him.

532
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,872
Do you know me at all?

533
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,115
I am not digging through trash.

534
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:56,220
Yeah, we"re gonna get
in a lot of trouble

535
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:57,946
if we dig through
this on the street.

536
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,500
Look, I"ve had to clean up
my driveway three times

537
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:02,467
in the last two weeks
because of raccoons.

538
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:04,780
That"s all anyone's gonna think.

539
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:07,645
If I find a used
condom in there,

540
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,361
I'm gonna be so jealous.

541
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:14,445
You guys are crazy.

542
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:15,308
Quit crying, Farraday.

543
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:17,541
Oh my god.

544
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:22,764
You know you can get AIDS from
looking through trash, right?

545
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,593
The only way you"re
ever getting AIDS.

546
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,629
I can"t believe it.

547
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:27,631
Nothing.

548
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,633
Maybe he doesn"t do
the killings here.

549
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,670
He could have, uh, like
a lair or something.

550
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:33,533
Somewhere.

551
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:34,361
A lair?

552
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,605
He"s Cobra Commander now?

553
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,460
You know, we could always
look through his mail.

554
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,153
For instance...

555
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:50,367
Ask and you shall receive.

556
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:52,379
Farraday"s right.

557
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,643
We can check his mail every day

558
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,969
and he"ll never suspect a thing.

559
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:59,663
See what bills he"s getting,
people sending him stuff.

560
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:02,137
I"ll take care of
that responsibility.

561
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,323
Guys, look. It's after midnight.

562
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:07,307
We should get out of here
before Mackey gets back.

563
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:08,706
Try again tomorrow?

564
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,984
Night one, no luck.

565
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:12,734
Says you.

566
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,368
Hey, Davey.

567
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:18,336
Um, do you think maybe I
can sleep over tonight?

568
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,786
I kinda don"t wanna be at home.

569
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,029
Yeah, sure.

570
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,790
We"ll make popcorn,
watch Close Encounters.

571
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:24,688
Awesome.

572
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:25,412
I"m gonna get my stuff.

573
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,438
I"ll be over in a bit.

574
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,059
Come on.

575
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,455
I love you mom.

576
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:21,907
You're so good.

577
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:53,086
Dude, what took you so long?

578
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,813
Expecting someone so late?

579
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:58,840
Uh, no, no, just uh, Woody.

580
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:05,754
Wow.

581
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,963
I guess I haven"t
been here in a while.

582
00:29:07,987 --> 00:29:09,585
Your mom moved everything.

583
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:10,483
Uh, yeah.

584
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:13,096
Yeah, I guess, like a year ago.

585
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:33,471
Where"d your folks
go all dressed up?

586
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:35,704
Um, date night.

587
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:39,743
Good.

588
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:01,741
Huh.

589
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:03,467
Better view of my
room than I thought.

590
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,194
I"ve never seen you naked.

591
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,989
That"s too bad.

592
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:10,567
I"ve got a great body.

593
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,720
Wow.

594
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:18,033
When I gave you that first
journal I did not think

595
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:20,577
it would lead to this.

596
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:25,616
God, we used to
have so much fun.

597
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,528
Sucks how much
things have changed.

598
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:31,184
Uh, yeah.

599
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,013
Yeah.

600
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,877
Things have changed.

601
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:36,534
You know, like good things.

602
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,090
I think we"re old enough
to hang out together now.

603
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,426
It"s too bad I'm leaving.

604
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,720
Davey?

605
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:50,755
We"re back.

606
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:52,367
Fuck me.

607
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,893
Sweet dreams.

608
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:11,707
Thanks again for everything, Mrs.
S.

609
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:13,088
Any time.

610
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:14,538
Call when you get home so
we know you"re safe, ok?

611
00:31:14,562 --> 00:31:15,642
Yeah, it"s cool, I will.

612
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,427
See you tomorrow.

613
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:42,029
Get down, shit-for-brains!

614
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,319
Woody, what"re you doing?

615
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:47,113
You"re gonna lose him!

616
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:48,011
Go!

617
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,219
Christ, I"m freaking out, ok?

618
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:51,014
My mom catches me,
I"m dead shit!

619
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,670
Woody, relax.

620
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:54,494
You said she was sleeping
off a 36 hour shift.

621
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:55,678
She"s gonna be out for hours.

622
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:57,158
Yeah, and you look
like you"re 30.

623
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,021
It"s gonna be fine.

624
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,332
Now, go.

625
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:00,702
Hurry up.

626
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,129
Keys...

627
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:05,224
Oh my god.

628
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,732
Hey, Woody.

629
00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:20,698
Where were you last night?

630
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:22,321
I thought you were coming over?

631
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:26,773
Yeah, um... sorry, my
mom needed my help.

632
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,189
Oh.

633
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:30,253
You"ll never guess who showed
up at my door instead.

634
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:33,021
Nikki.

635
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,436
No way.

636
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,921
There is a parallel universe
with butt-fucking wookies

637
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:38,785
where Nikki showed up at
your house last night.

638
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,201
I"m serious!

639
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:44,239
She was-she was about to kiss
me when my parents got home.

640
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:45,102
Guys.

641
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,576
Guys, Mackey"s coming out.

642
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,419
We are picking up
this convo later.

643
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:52,961
Yeah, ok.

644
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,491
"Is that a fuckin" pick axe?

645
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:12,084
Holy shit.

646
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,673
That is a lot of dirt.

647
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,100
Just like Kyle said.

648
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:18,953
How many bodies do you
think that would bury?

649
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,283
We gotta keep following him.

650
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:29,688
Go.

651
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:55,418
You drive like my grandma, dude.

652
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:56,829
We"re gonna lose him.

653
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:57,830
Shut it, Eats.

654
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:58,693
Woody, look out!

655
00:34:58,717 --> 00:34:59,717
Woah!

656
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:01,144
The hell, man?!

657
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:03,007
Get off the road, you maniac!

658
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:04,319
Great, now we lost him.

659
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:05,355
Frick this, ok?

660
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:06,183
I"m never doing this again.

661
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:06,942
You guys are dicks!

662
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:09,635
Guys, relax.

663
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:11,459
Let"s just get home as
fast as we can and hope

664
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:13,382
that"s where he's going, too.

665
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,002
Oh, shit.

666
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:33,210
Fuck.

667
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,891
Fuuuuck.

668
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,078
It"s a cop.

669
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,355
It"s a cop.

670
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:41,667
Dude, is that Mackey?

671
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:42,806
Everybody just be cool.

672
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,187
I don"t have my license, genius.

673
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:45,451
Tell him you forgot it at home.

674
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:46,672
How am I...

675
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,329
What if it"s fucking Mackey?

676
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:49,837
I"m so screwed.

677
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,250
Oh shit, Officer Cole.

678
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:16,702
Goddammit, Dale Woodworth,
I thought that was you.

679
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:18,286
Does your mother know
you stole her car?

680
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,222
No.

681
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,566
We, uh, we were
just borrowing it.

682
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,777
We ran out of snacks and
she was asleep so I just-

683
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,917
What if it wasn"t me
that pulled you over?

684
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:27,057
You could be in
some real trouble.

685
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:28,507
I know, I"m so sorry.

686
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:30,233
I won"t do it again.

687
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:33,788
You got me in quite a bind.

688
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:34,927
I just can"t bust you

689
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:35,928
because "cause then
how am I gonna look"

690
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:37,274
your mother in the
eye at church?

691
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:39,231
I know, I understand.

692
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:44,557
Mr. Eaton.

693
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,903
What a surprise.

694
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:47,974
Officer Cole.

695
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,759
We meet again.

696
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Look, guys.

697
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,774
Another kid has gone missing.

698
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,358
Everybody up at town
hall is in a panic.

699
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,571
They"ve been talking about
canceling the Bay Festival.

700
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:03,921
Get your asses home where
it"s safe and stay there.

701
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:05,440
You got it?

702
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:06,096
Yes sir.

703
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,235
Yes.

704
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,571
Straight home.

705
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:35,194
Guys, shit.

706
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:37,127
He switched cars.

707
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:37,921
Who cares?

708
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:38,853
Where"s the dirt?

709
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:39,923
That"s what I mean.

710
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,683
He doesn"t have it.

711
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:44,859
It must still be in his cruiser.

712
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:47,230
Unless he stashed it some place.

713
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,134
We"re onto you, Mackey.

714
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:15,372
I thought everything was fine.

715
00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:17,443
And then they just...

716
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:22,966
sat me down and told me they
don"t love each other anymore.

717
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,520
They didn"t even seem upset.

718
00:38:25,544 --> 00:38:27,374
So fucked up.

719
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:33,459
I just feel like my life
has been one big lie

720
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:37,325
and I can"t even talk
to anyone about it.

721
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,464
What about your friends?

722
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:40,224
Especially my friends.

723
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:43,227
All their parents are
still happily married.

724
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:45,091
Whatever that means.

725
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,680
Well, you don"t know that.

726
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:51,408
Who knows what really goes
on behind closed doors?

727
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:55,550
People will keep stuff
like that private.

728
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:58,553
Are your parents happy?

729
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:02,005
I don"t know, I guess.

730
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:07,390
Honestly, I can"t wait to get
out of this stupid town.

731
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:09,737
God, you must think
I"m such an idiot,

732
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:12,291
bringing you out here for this.

733
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:14,041
No way, never.

734
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:19,954
Can I tell you my secret?

735
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:23,129
Mmmhmm.

736
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:26,512
I think Mackey is the
Cape May Slayer.

737
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:29,204
Mr. Mackey?

738
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:31,414
Davey, he"s friends with my dad.

739
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,416
Yeah, that"s what he
wants you to think.

740
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,418
They go fishing.

741
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:37,972
Look, I know how
your brain works.

742
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:39,283
But you"re wrong.

743
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:41,803
No, look, this is different, ok?

744
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:43,080
We"ve been spying on him and-

745
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,081
What?

746
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,462
Davey, he"s a cop.

747
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:47,526
If your mom and dad found
out you were spying on him

748
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,741
they would flip their shit.

749
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:52,296
I know, that"s why they"re
not gonna find out.

750
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,127
At least not until we
have solid evidence.

751
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:56,887
Listen to me.

752
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:59,545
You gotta stop.

753
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:01,616
I"m not gonna get caught.

754
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,586
Davey, just let the
cops deal with this.

755
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,658
I don"t want anything
bad to happen to you.

756
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:12,593
You"re like the only person left
in this town I actually like.

757
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:14,353
Really?

758
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:15,492
What about Kyle?

759
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:16,942
What about Kyle?

760
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:19,417
He"s twenty and he works
at the hardware store.

761
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:39,033
Hey, uh, who wants
a freezie pop?

762
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:41,231
Nice and cold,
come and get "em!"

763
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:46,696
One for each of
you, there you go.

764
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,860
Enjoy.

765
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,036
Oh!

766
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,969
Snagged it from my dad"s stash.

767
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:21,178
Finally using those
brain powers for good.

768
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,041
About damn time.

769
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,826
Give it.

770
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:28,381
Oh.

771
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:29,877
It"s bad.

772
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,074
It"s so bad.

773
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:36,754
It tastes like my
mouth is bleeding.

774
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:38,193
Let me try it.

775
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,290
Oh.

776
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:44,467
Guess you dickheads
just aren"t men yet.

777
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:52,900
So, what"s the deal
with you and Nikki?

778
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:57,007
Well, we hung out
again last night.

779
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:57,905
Oooh, Davey.

780
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:59,251
No way.

781
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:02,219
We have, like-no, we have,
like, a connection.

782
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:03,945
A connection?

783
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:05,706
Any connection I want
with her is vaginal.

784
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,707
Oral if she"s into it.

785
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:09,630
Don"t talk about her like that.

786
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:14,635
Mackey"s still out there.

787
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:19,582
Look, Davey, we"ve
been on him for weeks.

788
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:21,086
I mean, if he was
gonna give us a clue

789
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,803
we"d have seen it by
now, don"t you think?

790
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:29,236
Not if they missed
it the first time.

791
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:47,782
What?

792
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:51,337
Everyone keeps their doors
unlocked around here.

793
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:54,064
Well, yeah, but this
was locked last time.

794
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:55,100
We gotta go in.

795
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:56,324
What if they"re dead in there?

796
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:58,103
You said he killed
kids, not adults.

797
00:42:58,127 --> 00:42:59,725
That"s not totally true.

798
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:01,669
One of the articles at the
library said he killed

799
00:43:01,693 --> 00:43:03,626
a whole family at Pacific Grove.

800
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,455
They said something
must have gone wrong.

801
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:06,421
And if it"s Mackey?

802
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:07,940
Fuck that.

803
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:09,977
I mean, you wanna go
in there, be my guest.

804
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,279
Dumbasses first.

805
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:16,179
Davey, I was kidding.

806
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:20,770
I"ve got a bad
feeling about this.

807
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,534
The light doesn"t work.

808
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,487
You guys smell that?

809
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:38,522
Yeah.

810
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:42,699
It smells like... roadkill.

811
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:43,923
If there"s dead bodies in here

812
00:43:43,947 --> 00:43:45,303
I"m totally gonna
shit my Calvins.

813
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:47,245
Oh...

814
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:06,574
You guys still think I"m crazy?

815
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:26,847
Woah, dude. Check your Calvins.

816
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:28,193
Guys, shut up!

817
00:44:28,217 --> 00:44:29,194
Ok?

818
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:31,254
He could still be in the house.

819
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:34,844
Hey, Woody, try the
kitchen light.

820
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,043
Motherfuckers!

821
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,587
Oh, you guys scared
the crap out of me!

822
00:44:52,611 --> 00:44:53,563
We scared you?!

823
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:55,116
I nearly had a goddamn
heart attack!

824
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,186
What"re you doing here?

825
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,360
With the lights off?

826
00:44:57,384 --> 00:44:59,465
I blew a fuse vacuuming
up this mess.

827
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:00,743
Stupid cats.

828
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:02,434
Why are you cleaning
up after their cats?

829
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,938
They rented an RV and went up to
the lake house for the summer.

830
00:45:04,962 --> 00:45:07,025
They pay me to make sure
their cats don"t die.

831
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:08,647
It"s easy money, usually.

832
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:09,752
You wanna explain to me

833
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:12,651
what the hell you
guys are doing here?

834
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:17,725
Um... well, Sammy was
missing so we thought

835
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:20,970
maybe the Hoffmans were dead.

836
00:45:20,994 --> 00:45:21,867
And let me guess.

837
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:24,628
You thought it was Mr. Mackey.

838
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:26,320
Seriously?

839
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:30,738
Wait, you were really
talking to her?

840
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:33,430
Ok, what"s going on here?

841
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:36,675
You guys hooking up?

842
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:42,291
Let"s just say he's more of
a man than you jerk-offs.

843
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:47,444
Oooh!

844
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:50,333
Davey, you are my God!

845
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:53,278
Oh, man.

846
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:55,718
Can I get a picture
of you for my shrine?

847
00:45:57,608 --> 00:45:59,008
And don"t forget to
clean your room.

848
00:45:59,032 --> 00:45:59,974
I mean it.

849
00:45:59,998 --> 00:46:01,769
I know, mom.

850
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:03,691
God.

851
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,645
Hey guys, what time are we
playing manhunt tonight?

852
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,671
I got an idea.

853
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,658
Alright, here"s the plan.

854
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:30,625
No way, you still have those?

855
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:32,386
While you guys are
spying we"re gonna plant

856
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,560
one of these outside
Mackey"s bedroom window.

857
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:35,944
We can use the other
one to listen.

858
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:36,839
Audio surveillance.

859
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:37,874
Smart.

860
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:39,462
Let"s just not get caught, ok?

861
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:43,535
If Mackey spots you just act
like it"s part of the game.

862
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:45,123
Now, we probably have
like two minutes

863
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:47,401
"til those little shits are
up our asses with flashlights

864
00:46:47,425 --> 00:46:48,712
so let"s be quick, ok?

865
00:46:48,736 --> 00:46:51,129
Farraday, Eats, you guys
take the back yard.

866
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:53,579
Me and Woody will
plant the walkie.

867
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,409
Operation Manhunt starts now.

868
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:57,193
Let"s go.

869
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,175
Hurry up!

870
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,201
Come on.

871
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:18,225
Who"s got eyes on him?

872
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,053
I got him.

873
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:19,882
He"s in the living room.

874
00:47:19,906 --> 00:47:20,779
Over.

875
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:22,563
Let"s go.

876
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:36,105
Found you, you bit
tittied butthole!

877
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:37,278
Nu-uh, we had time out.

878
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:38,693
No you don"t, I caught you.

879
00:47:38,717 --> 00:47:40,637
Why don"t you shut the
fuck up and get outta here

880
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:42,387
before I pound you,
you little shit?

881
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:43,284
Whatever, pussy.

882
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,354
You two are out.

883
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:46,046
Ha!

884
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,426
"I freakin" hate that kid.

885
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,187
I"ve got him.

886
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:50,360
Holy fuck.

887
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:51,706
Guys, he"s wearing rubber gloves

888
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,123
and he"s got a bucket
of cleaning shit.

889
00:47:54,147 --> 00:47:56,539
What?

890
00:47:56,563 --> 00:47:58,230
Wait, what do you mean?

891
00:47:58,254 --> 00:48:00,232
Farraday, he"s coming your way.

892
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:01,751
What"s in the bucket?

893
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:04,616
It looks like bleach,
a scrubbing brush,

894
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,274
and I can"t tell
what the rest is.

895
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:09,966
Holy shit, he"s
got blood on him!

896
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,819
What? Are you sure?

897
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,660
I- I don"t know.

898
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:15,627
It could be paint.

899
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:18,147
It"s on his shirt.

900
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:19,217
Shit.

901
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,484
He went into the basement.

902
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:28,260
What the hell?

903
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:30,504
All his basement windows
are painted over.

904
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:32,126
Mackey"s M.I.A.

905
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,817
Who"s watching the
basement door?

906
00:48:33,841 --> 00:48:35,429
Hey, let me down.

907
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:40,686
Alright, stay here.

908
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,540
Watch ok?

909
00:48:44,197 --> 00:48:45,612
Shit!

910
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:55,425
Do you think he"s onto us?

911
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:56,771
I don"t think so.

912
00:48:56,795 --> 00:48:59,982
As far as he knows we were
just playing manhunt.

913
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:01,949
Stupid G.I. Joe
walkie"s not working.

914
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,493
Well, you taped the
button down, right?

915
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:04,494
Of course I did.

916
00:49:04,518 --> 00:49:06,816
And the batteries are brand new.

917
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,335
It might be the distance then.

918
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:09,612
Those things were junk.

919
00:49:09,636 --> 00:49:11,614
That"s why we upgraded.

920
00:49:11,638 --> 00:49:13,758
Are you just gonna say frick
it and leave it up there?

921
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:14,651
No way.

922
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:16,401
I gotta make it work.

923
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:42,231
Davey.

924
00:49:42,255 --> 00:49:43,680
Hey.

925
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:46,545
I gotta say, you scared the
hell out of me last night.

926
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:49,169
Uh, yeah, yeah, we were
um, sorry about that.

927
00:49:49,193 --> 00:49:51,412
Just... we were just
playing manhunt

928
00:49:51,436 --> 00:49:53,828
and I didn"t expect you there.

929
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:55,175
No, I get it.

930
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,039
There"s a lot of good
hiding spots for manhunt.

931
00:49:57,063 --> 00:50:00,697
Yeah, your yard "s full of" em.

932
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:02,521
Guess you didn"t see me
coming either, though.

933
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:05,875
So what"s up?

934
00:50:05,899 --> 00:50:09,016
Wait, let me guess.

935
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,431
I owe you money.

936
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:11,743
Uh, yeah.

937
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,020
I"m ready for you this time.

938
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:14,735
Come on back.

939
00:50:34,077 --> 00:50:35,077
There you go.

940
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:36,595
Thanks.

941
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,046
Hey, you uh... you're not using
those things for manhunt,

942
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,082
are you?

943
00:50:40,106 --> 00:50:41,386
I mean, if you want real walkies

944
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,801
I got a couple that are
retired from the force.

945
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:43,740
They"re inside.

946
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:45,121
They"re just gathering dust.

947
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:46,605
You can come in and take a
look at them if you want.

948
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:47,744
They pick up everything.

949
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:49,436
I- I can"t right now.

950
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,954
Gotta get back to my route.

951
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:51,783
Alright.

952
00:50:51,807 --> 00:50:52,715
Thanks for the offer.

953
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:54,741
Yep.

954
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:02,380
Uh, sorry.

955
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:04,278
Um, I guess they are
pretty crappy, huh?

956
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:06,422
Well, the offer stands if you
ever want the real deal.

957
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:08,379
Just come on by any time.

958
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:31,788
Oh, shit!

959
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:47,010
Oh, fuck.

960
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,967
Fuck.

961
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:52,809
Guys, guys, come in.

962
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:54,801
I"m freaking the fuck out.

963
00:51:55,802 --> 00:51:57,002
Dude, it"s 1:00 in the morning.

964
00:51:57,026 --> 00:51:58,608
You"re gonna wake up my mom.

965
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,300
Not after the pounding
I just gave her.

966
00:52:00,324 --> 00:52:03,372
I"m serious!

967
00:52:03,396 --> 00:52:07,272
Emergency meeting,
treehouse, now.

968
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:09,136
"The friggen" walkie was
sitting in his window.

969
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,620
He wanted me to see it.

970
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,450
Oh my god, he"s onto us.

971
00:52:12,474 --> 00:52:14,866
Oh, I should have just
gone to space camp.

972
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,730
There"s no way he knows
why we"re spying on him

973
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:19,457
and even if he does
he"s only onto me,

974
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:21,493
which is why I
need you guys now.

975
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:23,875
When Mackey heads out
for his 11:00 jog,

976
00:52:23,899 --> 00:52:26,015
Farraday and Woody,
you"re gonna follow him.

977
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:27,879
I don"t like where
this is going.

978
00:52:27,903 --> 00:52:29,984
Yesterday on my route I
saw Mackey dumping dirt

979
00:52:30,008 --> 00:52:31,676
over something in his garden.

980
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,885
Something the size of a body.

981
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:37,337
While you two follow Mackey,
we"re gonna tear up his garden.

982
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:39,546
See if we can find that body.

983
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,030
What if Mackey catches us?

984
00:52:41,054 --> 00:52:42,307
That"s not gonna happen.

985
00:52:42,331 --> 00:52:44,516
That"s why I had you
grab Kyle"s CB's.

986
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,931
If Mackey starts heading back,

987
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,348
Woody and Farraday will
radio to let us know.

988
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:49,659
What about the garden?

989
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:51,403
He"s gonna notice his
plants are all dug up.

990
00:52:51,427 --> 00:52:52,317
Raccoons.

991
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:53,939
Just like the garbage
in the street.

992
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,769
Just wait for him to leave.

993
00:52:55,793 --> 00:52:58,116
And stay in touch with
our CB"s the whole time.

994
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,601
It's... it's foolproof.

995
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,352
Look, we need that evidence.

996
00:53:18,954 --> 00:53:20,621
We gotta get closer.

997
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:23,141
How the hell are we gonna do
that without him noticing us?

998
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:24,694
We?

999
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:27,041
I"m not going by myself.

1000
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:29,112
What are you, chicken?

1001
00:53:29,136 --> 00:53:30,804
Oh, nice try.

1002
00:53:30,828 --> 00:53:32,978
What if I told Eats about
that Hustler magazine

1003
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:35,533
we have that you stole?

1004
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:38,422
Goddammit, Farraday.

1005
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:57,579
Noah?

1006
00:54:03,516 --> 00:54:05,010
Oh...

1007
00:54:32,441 --> 00:54:34,201
Hello?

1008
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:36,825
Someone there?

1009
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:08,695
"That was way to friggen" close.

1010
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:09,799
Shit!

1011
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,239
What if he"s going to his house?

1012
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,840
Guys, we lost Mackey.

1013
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:18,325
I repeat, we lost Mackey.

1014
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:20,351
Do you copy?

1015
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,985
Fuck, Davey.

1016
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:24,573
There"s nothing here.

1017
00:55:24,597 --> 00:55:26,771
No, we"re just not
digging deep enough.

1018
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,820
Maybe he"s hiding
something in there.

1019
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:32,881
What?

1020
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:43,961
I can"t see anything.

1021
00:55:51,796 --> 00:55:53,729
I got this.

1022
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:57,940
What"re you doing?

1023
00:56:03,256 --> 00:56:05,096
How the hell"d you do that?

1024
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,029
I"m just good at
working the hole.

1025
00:56:07,053 --> 00:56:08,858
Seriously, how"d you do that?

1026
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:11,861
Honestly, you just jiggle
it a bunch, work it around,

1027
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:13,285
and it"ll pop open
most of the time.

1028
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:15,208
It"s easy.

1029
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:27,901
Unless he"s killing
people with his lawnmower

1030
00:56:27,925 --> 00:56:31,860
we got jack shit.

1031
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:55,457
Well, this whole night"s
been a waste of time.

1032
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:58,321
Until now.

1033
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:00,013
This is Dusty Dewitt"s shirt.

1034
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:00,841
Who?

1035
00:57:00,865 --> 00:57:02,695
Oh, the ginger?

1036
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:04,845
Shit.

1037
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:07,192
That"s blood.

1038
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:09,022
Hey, what"re you guys
doing in there?!

1039
00:57:10,012 --> 00:57:11,680
You got a death wish?

1040
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:12,922
Us?

1041
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:13,613
We"ve been trying to
call you on the CB

1042
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:15,511
for like 10 minutes.

1043
00:57:15,535 --> 00:57:16,650
We lost him.

1044
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:18,100
We don"t have a
clue where he went.

1045
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:19,481
We need to go, now.

1046
00:57:19,505 --> 00:57:23,105
And Davey, you"re not gonna
believe what we found.

1047
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:24,762
Neither are you guys.

1048
00:57:24,786 --> 00:57:27,064
Come on.

1049
00:57:27,651 --> 00:57:29,974
He keeps a car in
a storage unit?

1050
00:57:29,998 --> 00:57:31,941
And like a million
bags of dirt, too.

1051
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:33,771
Plus, shovels and a pick axe.

1052
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:35,358
Why would anyone need all that?

1053
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:37,382
It"s the same reason he's
got Dusty Dewitt"s shirt.

1054
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:39,777
He killed him and buried
the body somewhere.

1055
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:42,400
And there was like a bunch of
bags of um, something else.

1056
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:43,784
They had like
chemical signs on it.

1057
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,403
It looks hazardous.

1058
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:46,128
It said Noah.

1059
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:47,232
Noah was on the bag.

1060
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:47,992
Noah?

1061
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:48,820
What the hell"s that?

1062
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,028
How am I supposed to know?

1063
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:52,306
I just know it was like
spelled kinda weird.

1064
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,987
Here, hand me that.

1065
00:58:05,689 --> 00:58:07,218
Classic Woody.

1066
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:08,564
What?

1067
00:58:08,588 --> 00:58:10,487
This look right?

1068
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:13,569
Yeah, that"s the same thing.

1069
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:17,262
No, what you wrote means
absolutely nothing.

1070
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:21,888
What I wrote is the chemical
formula for sodium hydroxide.

1071
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:22,854
Congrats, Woody.

1072
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:23,993
You"re retarded.

1073
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:25,374
Shove it, Eats.

1074
00:58:25,398 --> 00:58:26,409
Stop.

1075
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:28,170
What the hell"s
sodium hydroxide?

1076
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:32,208
I don"t know, but I do know
that it"s not used in gardening

1077
00:58:32,232 --> 00:58:35,201
"cause I"m pretty sure
it"d be toxic to plants.

1078
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:46,291
Holy shit.

1079
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,879
Guys, look at this.

1080
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:50,848
Sodium hydroxide breaks
down the chemical bonds

1081
00:58:50,872 --> 00:58:55,922
that keep flesh intact, turning
organic tissue to liquid.

1082
00:58:55,946 --> 00:59:00,720
Frequently used to decompose
roadkill dumped in landfills.

1083
00:59:00,744 --> 00:59:04,689
This will reduce the
odour of decomposition.

1084
00:59:04,713 --> 00:59:06,713
This sicko"s using this
stuff to cover up the smell

1085
00:59:06,737 --> 00:59:12,041
from the dead bodies
he"s dumping some place.

1086
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:14,492
I got good news for you, Woody.

1087
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:17,484
It"s time to tell my parents.

1088
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:31,233
Mackey.

1089
00:59:31,257 --> 00:59:33,994
He"s a cop, for Christ's sake.

1090
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:36,018
He"s been our neighbour
since before you were born.

1091
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:38,620
Dad, every serial killer
is somebody"s neighbour-

1092
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:39,966
That milk carton.

1093
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:43,590
That t-shit and
the storage unit?

1094
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:45,730
That-that doesn"t
prove anything, guys.

1095
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:47,234
How could you guys
go along with this?

1096
00:59:47,258 --> 00:59:49,458
We wouldn"t have if it
didn't make so much sense.

1097
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:51,122
Yeah, and then when we
were following him-

1098
00:59:51,146 --> 00:59:52,668
Jesus, you have
been spying on him?

1099
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:54,187
Yeah, we had to!

1100
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:57,086
And the more we watched, the
more the details stack up.

1101
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,950
He goes jogging at
11:00 at night.

1102
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:00,987
He buys a ton of
dirt every week.

1103
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:03,852
He keeps a spare car
in a storage unit.

1104
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:05,543
Why would he do that?

1105
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:07,487
There was nothing in his
garden when we dug it up

1106
01:00:07,511 --> 01:00:08,178
but I"m-

1107
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:09,547
You dug up his garden?

1108
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:11,376
Oh, goddammit, David.

1109
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,447
You guys are in
deep, deep trouble.

1110
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:16,278
I mean, it"s vandalism,
spying, stealing.

1111
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,762
I mean, it"s unacceptable, boys.

1112
01:00:17,786 --> 01:00:18,763
We"re trying to save people.

1113
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:20,582
Yeah, well, you"re not.

1114
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:26,150
Alright, we"re gonna go
over there right now

1115
01:00:26,174 --> 01:00:29,394
and you"re gonna apologize
for all of this.

1116
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:32,352
And you better hope he
doesn"t press charges.

1117
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,080
Let"s go.

1118
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:48,862
Randall.

1119
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:50,036
Guys, what"s going on?

1120
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,796
Hey there, Wayne.

1121
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,868
Uh, listen, the boys have
something they need to tell you.

1122
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:56,352
And I want to
apologize in advance.

1123
01:00:56,376 --> 01:00:58,527
Just know that Sheila
and I are as outraged

1124
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:00,253
as you are about to be.

1125
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:03,280
I"m sure whatever it
is we can work it out.

1126
01:01:08,285 --> 01:01:11,264
Um... hey, Mr. Mackey.

1127
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:15,889
We just wanted to
say we"re sorry.

1128
01:01:15,913 --> 01:01:19,859
You probably thought it was
raccoons that dug up your garden

1129
01:01:19,883 --> 01:01:22,240
and your garbage.

1130
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:24,957
It was us.

1131
01:01:26,268 --> 01:01:28,477
Tell him why.

1132
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:40,017
A few weeks ago I thought I
saw this boy in your house.

1133
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:48,041
We were playing manhunt and
I had this idea that...

1134
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,777
you were maybe the
Cape May Slayer.

1135
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:56,930
Oh.

1136
01:01:56,954 --> 01:02:00,244
Well.

1137
01:02:00,268 --> 01:02:01,486
Uh...

1138
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,736
I"m sorry, it's just the
uh, guys at the station

1139
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,325
are gonna love this.

1140
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:16,398
So who was the boy
that was here?

1141
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:17,882
That was my nephew, Jamie.

1142
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:19,781
He was helping me to
renovate the dark room.

1143
01:02:19,805 --> 01:02:23,439
I thought you didn"t
have family nearby.

1144
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:24,820
And we found this in your shed.

1145
01:02:24,844 --> 01:02:26,684
David.

1146
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:27,996
You broke into my
shed, too, huh?

1147
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,687
You don"t have to
answer any of this.

1148
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:30,619
I"m sorry.

1149
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:32,000
No, no, it"s fine.

1150
01:02:32,024 --> 01:02:33,967
We were hammering nails all
day, he probably cut himself.

1151
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:35,711
Why don"t you guys come
in, we can call him,

1152
01:02:35,735 --> 01:02:36,975
we can clear this up right now.

1153
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:38,627
That is not necessary at all.

1154
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:40,698
Look, we just wanted to let
you know what happened

1155
01:02:40,722 --> 01:02:43,287
and uh, the boys promise to fix
anything that they damaged

1156
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:45,289
no matter how long it takes.

1157
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:47,015
Right?

1158
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,294
Yes, sir.

1159
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:52,192
Look, I appreciate the
apology but honestly,

1160
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:54,954
no hard feelings.

1161
01:02:54,978 --> 01:02:57,128
I remember what it was like
to be a boy in the summer.

1162
01:02:57,152 --> 01:02:58,820
It"s hard to pass
up an adventure.

1163
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:02,019
You are a better man than
me, Wayne, thank you.

1164
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,482
This doesn"t change anything.

1165
01:03:06,506 --> 01:03:07,794
Are you high?

1166
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:09,554
Your summer"s fucked.

1167
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:12,143
We may get out of this
with just garden duty.

1168
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:14,448
I"m not risking the little of
the good life I"ve got left.

1169
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:16,838
Yeah, Davey, spying on
Mackey was fun and stuff

1170
01:03:16,862 --> 01:03:18,736
but this is way too heavy.

1171
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,463
I"m out.

1172
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:24,121
Guys, go home.

1173
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:26,465
And I"m calling all your parents
and I will be telling them

1174
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:28,194
what happened.

1175
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:29,840
Go.

1176
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:32,681
Not you.

1177
01:03:32,705 --> 01:03:34,856
You are grounded until
further notice.

1178
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,859
I"m so disappointed
in you, David.

1179
01:03:37,883 --> 01:03:40,585
Just-look, just go home and
do not come out of your room

1180
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:42,680
until I say so.

1181
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:11,202
Hello?

1182
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:13,850
Can you come over?

1183
01:04:17,715 --> 01:04:20,729
It"s so surreal.

1184
01:04:20,753 --> 01:04:25,527
It feels like I was
just a kid, you know?

1185
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:27,736
Oh my god.

1186
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,911
Look at this one.

1187
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:31,913
That is definitely coming
with me to Stanford.

1188
01:04:31,937 --> 01:04:32,706
Oh god, really?

1189
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,776
Can"t we just burn it?

1190
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,708
What?

1191
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:35,606
No way.

1192
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:38,264
It"s a classic.

1193
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:40,328
You know, I didn"t think I
was gonna miss this place

1194
01:04:40,352 --> 01:04:43,614
but now I can"t deal.

1195
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:45,616
Everyone"s talking to me
like I"m already gone.

1196
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,894
It"s wigging me out.

1197
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:53,037
You know, it just feels
like the end, you know?

1198
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:59,388
And the closer it gets
the more I feel alone.

1199
01:04:59,412 --> 01:05:02,174
Hey, you"re not alone.

1200
01:05:05,028 --> 01:05:06,948
After today I wish I could
get out of this stupid

1201
01:05:06,972 --> 01:05:09,122
neighbourhood with you.

1202
01:05:09,146 --> 01:05:10,572
I"m sorry.

1203
01:05:10,596 --> 01:05:12,667
You wanna leave?

1204
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:16,405
Holy shit.

1205
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:19,098
You got caught.

1206
01:05:19,122 --> 01:05:21,100
Davey!

1207
01:05:21,124 --> 01:05:23,688
My dad made me admit the
whole thing to Mackey.

1208
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,621
No he didn"t.

1209
01:05:25,645 --> 01:05:27,313
Oh my god.

1210
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:28,970
I"m so grounded.

1211
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:33,629
I"m-I'm gonna be locked up
until I leave for college.

1212
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:37,323
Wait, if you"re grounded how
are you here right now?

1213
01:05:37,347 --> 01:05:39,842
Well, my parents
are downtown so I-

1214
01:05:39,866 --> 01:05:41,430
I just snuck out.

1215
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:43,708
Just a rebel without a cause.

1216
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:45,848
You"re done now, right?

1217
01:05:45,872 --> 01:05:47,540
Right?

1218
01:05:47,564 --> 01:05:52,372
Well, the guys all bailed on me
so there"s not much I can do.

1219
01:05:52,396 --> 01:05:55,030
I know I"m right about him.

1220
01:05:55,054 --> 01:05:57,032
That"s the shittiest part.

1221
01:05:57,056 --> 01:05:59,207
Just let it go.

1222
01:05:59,231 --> 01:06:01,485
You only get a chance
to be a kid once.

1223
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:04,281
Believe me, I know.

1224
01:06:04,305 --> 01:06:08,457
So enjoy it while you can.

1225
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:14,384
But if I"m right,
who"s gonna stop him?

1226
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,760
Davey.

1227
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:39,557
How"s it going?

1228
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:41,042
What"re you doing here?

1229
01:06:41,066 --> 01:06:43,078
Just kinda wanna make
sure that we"re good.

1230
01:06:43,102 --> 01:06:47,013
I feel bad about everything
that happened yesterday.

1231
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:48,277
Mind if I come in for a second?

1232
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:49,106
We can talk about it?

1233
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,155
Now is not a good time.

1234
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:53,882
Ok.

1235
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:55,346
Hey, you know that
we"ve got everyone

1236
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,059
that we have looking
for this sicko, right?

1237
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:00,026
Why haven"t you found him yet?

1238
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,614
Well, these things take time.

1239
01:07:01,638 --> 01:07:03,926
Sometimes years.

1240
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:07,033
If you want I can stop
by, give you updates.

1241
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:08,897
No, you don"t have to do that.

1242
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:11,072
I see the paper before
anyone, remember?

1243
01:07:11,096 --> 01:07:12,038
You sure?

1244
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,246
It"d be my pleasure.

1245
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,070
I can tell you have an
interest in this stuff.

1246
01:07:15,094 --> 01:07:18,079
Was there anything else, Mr.
Mackey?

1247
01:07:18,103 --> 01:07:21,416
Wow, you uh, you really
got it in for me, huh?

1248
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,464
Uh... Davey, I like you.

1249
01:07:24,488 --> 01:07:25,914
I think you"re a
good kid, alright?

1250
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:27,898
The last thing I want is
for there to be bad blood

1251
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:29,400
between us.

1252
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:31,092
Yeah, me too.

1253
01:07:31,116 --> 01:07:36,097
It"s just uh, my summer's
basically destroyed

1254
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:38,961
and I"m pretty sure my
parents hate me now.

1255
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:40,105
You want me to talk to them?

1256
01:07:40,129 --> 01:07:41,449
See if I can lighten
the sentence?

1257
01:07:41,473 --> 01:07:42,413
I"m happy to do that.

1258
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:44,208
No, it's... it's alright.

1259
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:47,625
Thanks, though.

1260
01:07:47,649 --> 01:07:51,077
You"ve got quite
the imagination.

1261
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,666
Yeah, I guess.

1262
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:56,807
Um... my dad says it's because
I read too many mysteries

1263
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:59,672
and with the killer on the
loose I got caught up in it.

1264
01:07:59,696 --> 01:08:01,087
I get it.

1265
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:03,331
That"s the whole
reason I became a cop.

1266
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:05,126
It"s exciting, the
stuff that"s going on.

1267
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:07,576
And you wanna help,
and that"s great.

1268
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,856
And I"ll admit that the stuff
that you thought was proof

1269
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,687
looks pretty bad out of context.

1270
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:18,277
You got a pretty good brain
for this kind of work.

1271
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:21,590
Davey, is there anything I can
do to help smooth things over?

1272
01:08:21,614 --> 01:08:27,424
Um... well, yesterday you
offered to call your nephew.

1273
01:08:27,448 --> 01:08:30,323
Would you mind maybe
just calling him now?

1274
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:32,670
Absolutely.

1275
01:08:32,694 --> 01:08:35,363
Just kinda gotta...
come in to do that.

1276
01:08:35,387 --> 01:08:39,125
Uh, no, no, actually our
cord"s really long.

1277
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:41,462
Just wait here a sec.

1278
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:49,825
Shit!

1279
01:08:49,849 --> 01:08:51,989
Shit.

1280
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,495
Place looks great.

1281
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:07,015
I haven't been in here since...
you must have been a toddler.

1282
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:09,362
I helped your dad get some
stuff into the attic.

1283
01:09:11,077 --> 01:09:13,666
My sister"s in Seattle.

1284
01:09:20,742 --> 01:09:23,411
Hmm.

1285
01:09:23,435 --> 01:09:26,345
Not answering.

1286
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:27,415
Jamie"s big into baseball.

1287
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,235
He might be at
practice or something.

1288
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:35,699
Well, maybe I"ll come back
later, we can try him again.

1289
01:09:35,723 --> 01:09:36,389
Uh, no.

1290
01:09:36,413 --> 01:09:38,219
It"s ok.

1291
01:09:38,243 --> 01:09:40,945
Look, I"m sorry for
being such an idiot.

1292
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:43,879
I promise I"ll fix your garden
even better than it was.

1293
01:09:43,903 --> 01:09:46,779
No hard feelings.

1294
01:09:46,803 --> 01:09:49,402
Sorry again that
you"re uh, grounded.

1295
01:09:49,426 --> 01:09:52,291
I"m gonna see if I can get
you outta this house.

1296
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:56,133
Listen, Davey.

1297
01:09:56,157 --> 01:09:58,756
I"m gonna do everything I
can to catch this bastard.

1298
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,713
I promise.

1299
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:20,364
Operator, how may I
direct your call?

1300
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:25,266
Um, can you tell me the last
number dialed from this house?

1301
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:33,290
The last number dialed from
that residence was 555-0167.

1302
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:47,080
How are you guys not
freaking out right now?

1303
01:10:47,104 --> 01:10:48,634
He called himself.

1304
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:50,187
There"s no Jamie.

1305
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:51,568
This proves he"s guilty.

1306
01:10:51,592 --> 01:10:53,432
We gotta get into that
house to find out what"s

1307
01:10:53,456 --> 01:10:54,122
in the basement.

1308
01:10:54,146 --> 01:10:55,675
Are you crazy?

1309
01:10:55,699 --> 01:10:58,437
Look how much trouble we got in
just for digging up his garden.

1310
01:10:58,461 --> 01:10:59,679
Davey?

1311
01:10:59,703 --> 01:11:00,853
Come down here.

1312
01:11:00,877 --> 01:11:02,820
Shit.

1313
01:11:02,844 --> 01:11:04,644
If I think she knows
you"re up here I'll radio

1314
01:11:04,668 --> 01:11:07,153
so you can climb up the window.

1315
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:11,415
I want you to see this.

1316
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:13,359
Please stand by as we
join a press conference

1317
01:11:13,383 --> 01:11:15,695
underway at city hall for
an update in the case of

1318
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:17,318
the Cape May Slayer.

1319
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:19,841
We are happy to
report that we have

1320
01:11:19,865 --> 01:11:23,462
the Cape May Slayer in custody.

1321
01:11:23,486 --> 01:11:26,327
Thanks to the fine efforts of
the Ipswich Police Department,

1322
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:30,493
we apprehended Mr. Arthur
Ray Peterson earlier today.

1323
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:35,888
And I would like to bring
up the arresting officer.

1324
01:11:35,912 --> 01:11:36,992
No, I think it"s perfect.

1325
01:11:37,016 --> 01:11:38,304
Wayne Mackey.

1326
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:43,033
This is what everyone needs.

1327
01:11:43,057 --> 01:11:44,897
I know that this is uh,
it"s been a trying time

1328
01:11:44,921 --> 01:11:48,176
for our community but uh, we
hope that this announcement

1329
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,178
can bring a little peace

1330
01:11:50,202 --> 01:11:52,353
to those who have
been living in fear.

1331
01:11:52,377 --> 01:11:54,147
I"ll be there in a few. Bye.

1332
01:11:54,171 --> 01:11:55,494
Justice will be served.

1333
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:00,050
The Bay Festival"s back on,

1334
01:12:00,074 --> 01:12:02,224
and all because of Mr. Mackey.

1335
01:12:02,248 --> 01:12:03,448
So while we"re all celebrating

1336
01:12:03,472 --> 01:12:05,642
I want you to think
about your actions.

1337
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,092
It turns out the man across
the street is not a killer,

1338
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:09,887
David.

1339
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:12,189
He"s a hero.

1340
01:12:15,607 --> 01:12:16,722
A hero.

1341
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:18,724
Did you guys not
hear the broadcast?

1342
01:12:18,748 --> 01:12:20,381
He"s clearly guilty.

1343
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:22,383
And you"re clearly
fucked in the head.

1344
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:23,687
Dude, he just caught the killer.

1345
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:25,109
It can"t be him.

1346
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:27,414
Don"t you think it's a little
coincidental that the person

1347
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:30,045
we just accused of being
the killer just so happens

1348
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:31,944
to then catch the killer?

1349
01:12:31,968 --> 01:12:34,222
Dude, you just sound
desperate now, ok?

1350
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:35,534
Just admit you were wrong.

1351
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:37,018
I"m not wrong.

1352
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:39,082
And I know there"s something
behind that locked door

1353
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:40,401
in his basement.

1354
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:43,231
We have to find out what it
is before more people die.

1355
01:12:43,255 --> 01:12:44,715
Listen, Davey.

1356
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:46,614
Even if you were to
hypothetically get

1357
01:12:46,638 --> 01:12:48,029
into his basement,

1358
01:12:48,053 --> 01:12:50,272
there"s no way you could
take anything to prove it

1359
01:12:50,296 --> 01:12:51,688
without him knowing
that it"s you.

1360
01:12:51,712 --> 01:12:52,930
I don"t have to.

1361
01:12:52,954 --> 01:12:55,312
I"ll use my dad's
camcorder, film it all.

1362
01:12:55,336 --> 01:12:57,694
No need to steal anything
if I get it on tape.

1363
01:12:57,718 --> 01:13:00,341
Tape doesn"t lie.

1364
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:06,875
I know you guys all
think I"m crazy,

1365
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:08,877
but I"m gonna prove it to you.

1366
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:11,880
Look, I"ll take
all the risk, ok?

1367
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:13,813
I just need you guys
to watch my back.

1368
01:13:13,837 --> 01:13:17,161
Make sure Mackey doesn"t
come home while I"m inside.

1369
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,646
No.

1370
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,958
I"m done with this shit, ok?

1371
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:23,616
You"re gonna get caught, either
by Mackey or your dad or-

1372
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,238
No.

1373
01:13:25,262 --> 01:13:27,502
Because everyone"s gonna be
at the Bay Festival tomorrow.

1374
01:13:27,526 --> 01:13:29,346
All I need you to do is
set up at the bus stop

1375
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,659
down the street, ok?

1376
01:13:31,683 --> 01:13:32,487
And Farraday-

1377
01:13:32,511 --> 01:13:33,799
No, dude.

1378
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:35,503
You know that my parents
take me every year

1379
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:37,250
and there is no way
they"d let me ditch.

1380
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:40,564
Which is why I need you to
keep an eye on Mackey there.

1381
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:43,843
If he leaves the party early
just give me a heads up.

1382
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:46,328
Woody, I need you to stay
and watch right outside

1383
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:48,469
his house.

1384
01:13:48,493 --> 01:13:50,413
With multiple layers of
protection there"s no way

1385
01:13:50,437 --> 01:13:53,681
I get caught.

1386
01:13:53,705 --> 01:13:56,856
Are you with me?

1387
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,927
Whatever. Fine.

1388
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:02,586
But if shit goes sideways
I"m pinning it all on you.

1389
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,163
Yeah.

1390
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:09,548
This is your last shot, Davey.

1391
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:16,393
I mean, if you think there"s
something down there...

1392
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:19,006
I guess I"m in, too.

1393
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:32,064
This is so not fair.

1394
01:14:32,088 --> 01:14:33,134
David.

1395
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:34,894
Punishment"s a punishment, pal.

1396
01:14:34,918 --> 01:14:37,078
If you really cared about
going you wouldn"t have acted

1397
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:38,484
like a delinquent all summer.

1398
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:41,004
Hey, just let me go and I"ll
be grounded again after.

1399
01:14:41,028 --> 01:14:43,271
Not happening, end of story.

1400
01:15:00,703 --> 01:15:02,646
Alright guys, it"s go time.

1401
01:15:35,496 --> 01:15:36,577
I got eyes on him.

1402
01:15:36,601 --> 01:15:38,579
Over.

1403
01:15:38,603 --> 01:15:39,856
Roger that.

1404
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,467
How"re you looking, Eats?

1405
01:15:57,967 --> 01:16:02,879
What? Can"t take a
little family time?

1406
01:16:02,903 --> 01:16:04,801
Fuck off, Kyle.

1407
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:06,607
Eats.

1408
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:07,711
Eats.

1409
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:12,647
Are you in position?

1410
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,407
You want a lift, limp dick?

1411
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:17,331
Why, you need an alibi?

1412
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:34,866
Ok.

1413
01:16:35,832 --> 01:16:37,178
Hold this.

1414
01:16:38,283 --> 01:16:39,767
This, too.

1415
01:16:47,948 --> 01:16:49,501
Come on.

1416
01:17:04,389 --> 01:17:05,389
Can you hold it?

1417
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:06,528
Yeah.

1418
01:17:06,552 --> 01:17:08,013
Here.

1419
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:10,291
If you see anything,
make some noise.

1420
01:17:10,315 --> 01:17:11,672
Alright?

1421
01:17:11,696 --> 01:17:12,534
Move over.

1422
01:17:12,558 --> 01:17:13,777
What for?

1423
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:14,813
I"m not gonna let my
best friend go in

1424
01:17:14,837 --> 01:17:16,400
a serial killer"s house alone.

1425
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:17,539
Hold the window.

1426
01:17:17,563 --> 01:17:20,025
Ok.

1427
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:20,681
You good?

1428
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:22,879
Yeah. I think so.

1429
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:25,433
Alright, let"s go.

1430
01:17:26,066 --> 01:17:27,066
Thanks, Woody.

1431
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,896
I owe you one.

1432
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,160
Let"s just make this quick, ok?

1433
01:17:30,184 --> 01:17:31,657
Ok.

1434
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:32,969
What are you guys doing?

1435
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:39,492
Why do you keep
doing that to us?

1436
01:17:39,516 --> 01:17:41,702
Because it"s so easy.

1437
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:42,703
What"re you doing here?

1438
01:17:42,727 --> 01:17:45,015
I figured you"d need some help.

1439
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:46,568
I thought you said I
should let it go.

1440
01:17:46,592 --> 01:17:50,010
Yeah, but if you"re right,
who else is gonna stop him?

1441
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:36,549
Oh, come on.

1442
01:18:36,573 --> 01:18:38,551
Davey?

1443
01:18:38,575 --> 01:18:40,139
Davey, do you copy?

1444
01:18:40,163 --> 01:18:41,382
Is he on his way back?

1445
01:18:41,406 --> 01:18:42,038
Way worse.

1446
01:18:42,062 --> 01:18:43,108
You were wrong.

1447
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:44,412
You were wrong about everything.

1448
01:18:44,436 --> 01:18:45,379
The dirt, the shovels,
the pick axe,

1449
01:18:45,403 --> 01:18:46,490
it was all for a project

1450
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:48,234
Mackey was doing with
the police department.

1451
01:18:48,258 --> 01:18:50,408
They planted a shitload
of flowers down here.

1452
01:18:50,432 --> 01:18:52,117
Listen to me.

1453
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:53,497
It"s over.

1454
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,464
No, Farraday, wait.

1455
01:18:54,488 --> 01:18:55,430
I"m sorry, man.

1456
01:18:55,454 --> 01:18:57,294
But you"re on your own.

1457
01:18:57,318 --> 01:18:58,744
Maybe he"s right.

1458
01:18:58,768 --> 01:19:00,919
We should just go.

1459
01:19:00,943 --> 01:19:04,163
I mean, we"re already here.

1460
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:06,062
We might as well
just check it out.

1461
01:19:06,086 --> 01:19:08,236
And if it"s not him
then we know, right?

1462
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,169
It"s him.

1463
01:19:10,193 --> 01:19:14,070
Look, Eats is still in
position so we"re safe.

1464
01:19:14,094 --> 01:19:17,694
We have to look "cause we"re
about to find the proof.

1465
01:19:17,718 --> 01:19:20,307
I know it.

1466
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:55,180
Please tell me somebody
brought a flashlight.

1467
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:58,138
Oh, uh, there should be
one on the camcorder.

1468
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,489
Ok, come on.

1469
01:20:06,871 --> 01:20:08,769
Creepiest basement ever.

1470
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,860
Jesus fuck!

1471
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:20,884
Oh, jeez.

1472
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,759
Oh my god, calm down.

1473
01:20:22,783 --> 01:20:23,898
It"s just a light.

1474
01:20:23,922 --> 01:20:25,924
Are you ok?

1475
01:20:27,581 --> 01:20:28,893
Ok.

1476
01:20:39,328 --> 01:20:40,328
Quiet down!

1477
01:20:40,352 --> 01:20:42,389
Take a chill pill!

1478
01:20:44,184 --> 01:20:46,576
Shine the flashlight
on the lock.

1479
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,165
What"re you doing?

1480
01:20:49,189 --> 01:20:51,029
Seriously, did Eats
teach you this?

1481
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:52,744
It doesn"t work.

1482
01:20:58,301 --> 01:20:59,785
Shit.

1483
01:21:15,767 --> 01:21:16,951
Vagina!

1484
01:21:16,975 --> 01:21:18,711
Farraday, you fucking dick!

1485
01:21:18,735 --> 01:21:19,895
What are you even doing here?

1486
01:21:19,919 --> 01:21:20,861
You"re supposed to
be watching Mackey.

1487
01:21:20,885 --> 01:21:22,198
The whole thing"s off.

1488
01:21:22,222 --> 01:21:23,751
Mackey"s clean, 100 percent.

1489
01:21:23,775 --> 01:21:25,580
Are you fucking kidding me?

1490
01:21:25,604 --> 01:21:27,444
It"s a long story.

1491
01:21:27,468 --> 01:21:28,618
Just trust me.

1492
01:21:28,642 --> 01:21:29,791
It"s not him.

1493
01:21:29,815 --> 01:21:30,447
Fuck that.

1494
01:21:30,471 --> 01:21:31,932
I gotta hear this.

1495
01:21:31,956 --> 01:21:35,487
Maybe I could sleep at
your place tonight?

1496
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:37,282
Parents again?

1497
01:21:37,306 --> 01:21:40,112
How bad is it this time?

1498
01:21:40,136 --> 01:21:43,312
Let"s just say I don't wanna
witness a murder suicide.

1499
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:46,832
Yeah.

1500
01:21:55,324 --> 01:21:58,085
But I"m not watching
Gilligan"s Island.

1501
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:12,341
What the hell is this place?

1502
01:22:13,342 --> 01:22:17,484
You think he... keeps his
victims here or something?

1503
01:22:24,146 --> 01:22:25,847
Guys.

1504
01:22:25,871 --> 01:22:33,269
"“To Wayne. Keep it up, slugger.
1958."”

1505
01:22:33,293 --> 01:22:35,616
Holy shit, was this his room?

1506
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,342
When he was a kid?

1507
01:22:37,366 --> 01:22:39,654
That doesn"t make any sense.

1508
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:43,130
I mean, these houses weren"t
even built back then.

1509
01:22:45,063 --> 01:22:47,410
God, suburbia is so fucked up.

1510
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:50,918
Davey, you said there was
gonna be evidence here.

1511
01:22:50,942 --> 01:22:52,875
Where is it?

1512
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:57,593
Oh my god!

1513
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:02,332
No, no, no, no.

1514
01:23:02,356 --> 01:23:04,910
Davey, no, no.

1515
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:09,063
Just make sure you"re filming.

1516
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:11,089
No, Davey, wait.

1517
01:23:40,567 --> 01:23:43,235
Is this enough proof for you?

1518
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:45,513
Davey, we need to go.

1519
01:23:45,537 --> 01:23:46,169
Now.

1520
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:47,688
Come on.

1521
01:23:47,712 --> 01:23:49,127
Wait, what"s that?

1522
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:51,519
Oh my god.

1523
01:23:58,976 --> 01:23:59,976
Oh my god!

1524
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,277
Help...

1525
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:06,189
Come on, guys.

1526
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:06,707
Come on.

1527
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:07,397
Are you ok?

1528
01:24:07,421 --> 01:24:08,709
Watch out, watch out.

1529
01:24:08,733 --> 01:24:09,399
Let"s go.

1530
01:24:09,423 --> 01:24:10,055
Let"s go.

1531
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:11,608
Come on.

1532
01:24:11,632 --> 01:24:12,885
Oh my god, Davey!

1533
01:24:12,909 --> 01:24:13,817
Davey, let"s go!

1534
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:14,611
Davey, come on!

1535
01:24:14,635 --> 01:24:16,234
We gotta get out of here!

1536
01:24:16,258 --> 01:24:17,925
Davey!

1537
01:24:17,949 --> 01:24:19,064
What are you looking at?

1538
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:19,927
Holy shit!

1539
01:24:19,951 --> 01:24:21,780
Davey! Davey!

1540
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:26,406
Guys, the people in the
pictures aren"t his family.

1541
01:24:28,994 --> 01:24:30,513
They"re his victims.

1542
01:24:31,169 --> 01:24:32,584
What?

1543
01:24:36,174 --> 01:24:37,796
I"m next.

1544
01:24:39,177 --> 01:24:40,316
Oh my god.

1545
01:24:42,456 --> 01:24:44,469
Is this enough proof for you?

1546
01:24:44,493 --> 01:24:46,850
Davey, we need to go.

1547
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:47,334
Now.

1548
01:24:47,358 --> 01:24:49,084
Come on.

1549
01:25:01,613 --> 01:25:03,419
You found all this in his house?

1550
01:25:03,443 --> 01:25:04,592
Yeah, and there"s
pictures of dead people

1551
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:05,973
"all over the freakin" walls!

1552
01:25:05,997 --> 01:25:07,802
What were you even doing there?

1553
01:25:07,826 --> 01:25:09,770
Get out to Mackey"s.

1554
01:25:09,794 --> 01:25:12,624
Bring that sick son
of a bitch to me.

1555
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:15,110
Let's go.

1556
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:18,261
You folks should be proud.

1557
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:22,162
That boy"s alive
because of your son.

1558
01:25:22,186 --> 01:25:24,198
He"s a hero.

1559
01:25:43,345 --> 01:25:44,667
You ok?

1560
01:25:44,691 --> 01:25:46,462
Uh, yeah.

1561
01:25:46,486 --> 01:25:48,671
What"re you doing
out here all alone?

1562
01:25:48,695 --> 01:25:51,087
My parents are giving
a report, I guess.

1563
01:25:51,111 --> 01:25:53,503
Hmm.

1564
01:25:53,527 --> 01:25:58,819
Kinda feels like none of
this is actually real.

1565
01:25:58,843 --> 01:26:03,858
My parents just got here and
I saw them hug each other

1566
01:26:03,882 --> 01:26:06,240
for the first time
in a while, so...

1567
01:26:06,264 --> 01:26:08,000
Well, that"s awesome, right?

1568
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:11,003
I"m not gonna get my hopes
up, but it happened

1569
01:26:11,027 --> 01:26:12,660
because of you.

1570
01:26:12,684 --> 01:26:14,686
I don"t know about that.

1571
01:26:17,896 --> 01:26:20,347
See ya, Davey.

1572
01:26:53,277 --> 01:26:55,945
I love you, pal.

1573
01:26:55,969 --> 01:26:59,086
And I"m so sorry.

1574
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,087
I"m proud of you.

1575
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:02,907
I"m real proud.

1576
01:27:21,443 --> 01:27:23,800
Davey"s got the sleeping
bag all set up for you.

1577
01:27:23,824 --> 01:27:25,824
And when your mom gets off
her shift in the morning

1578
01:27:25,848 --> 01:27:27,287
she will pick you up.

1579
01:27:27,311 --> 01:27:30,773
Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong.

1580
01:27:30,797 --> 01:27:33,293
You guys are safe now.

1581
01:27:33,317 --> 01:27:36,630
We"ll keep an eye out and make
sure nothing else happens.

1582
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,749
I wonder where he is.

1583
01:27:41,773 --> 01:27:43,579
Well, the APB"s
been out for hours.

1584
01:27:43,603 --> 01:27:44,925
They"ll get him.

1585
01:27:44,949 --> 01:27:47,607
It"s just a matter of time.

1586
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:53,002
We love you.

1587
01:27:53,026 --> 01:27:55,038
You boys are gonna be
the talk of the town.

1588
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:57,178
How does that feel?

1589
01:27:57,202 --> 01:28:00,378
Nothing"s ever gonna
be the same again.

1590
01:28:05,349 --> 01:28:08,248
Alright, get some rest, you two.

1591
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:10,468
Goodnight.

1592
01:28:10,492 --> 01:28:12,701
"Night."

1593
01:28:18,396 --> 01:28:20,961
You think they"ll catch him?

1594
01:28:20,985 --> 01:28:23,722
There"s nowhere left
for him to hide.

1595
01:28:23,746 --> 01:28:27,336
It"s over. We got him.

1596
01:30:58,901 --> 01:31:06,609
Woody! Woody!

1597
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:09,301
Get up!

1598
01:31:09,325 --> 01:31:10,855
Turn around.

1599
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:11,994
I"ll untie you.

1600
01:31:22,753 --> 01:31:25,169
It"s Mackey!

1601
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,103
I can"t see shit!

1602
01:31:29,414 --> 01:31:30,692
What the fuck was that?!

1603
01:31:35,006 --> 01:31:36,190
We gotta get outta here!

1604
01:31:36,214 --> 01:31:36,984
No, no, no, no!

1605
01:31:37,008 --> 01:31:39,573
Yes, we have to!

1606
01:31:39,597 --> 01:31:42,876
Wait-he"s-he's out there.

1607
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,435
Where is he?

1608
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:53,680
Oh, my god, run!!!

1609
01:31:58,685 --> 01:32:01,043
I know how much you
guys like games.

1610
01:32:01,067 --> 01:32:03,414
So I got a surprise for you.

1611
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,842
We"re gonna play manhunt.

1612
01:32:06,866 --> 01:32:09,396
Only now we are gonna
play it for real!

1613
01:32:10,973 --> 01:32:12,779
It"s ok. He can't catch
us if we keep moving.

1614
01:32:12,803 --> 01:32:13,745
Alright?

1615
01:32:13,769 --> 01:32:15,747
We gotta go. Let"s go.

1616
01:32:33,513 --> 01:32:34,594
What-what the hell?

1617
01:32:34,618 --> 01:32:35,318
Shit!

1618
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:36,827
Come on.

1619
01:32:49,011 --> 01:32:51,645
Where did he take us?

1620
01:32:51,669 --> 01:32:53,129
It"s a tidal island.

1621
01:32:53,153 --> 01:32:53,751
It has to be.

1622
01:32:53,775 --> 01:32:54,337
Fuck.

1623
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:55,580
What do we do?

1624
01:32:55,604 --> 01:32:56,270
If we-if we just keep
going, eventually-

1625
01:32:56,294 --> 01:32:56,926
We"ll find a road.

1626
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:58,469
Come on.

1627
01:33:11,689 --> 01:33:12,735
It"s ok, it's ok.

1628
01:33:12,759 --> 01:33:13,759
It"s ok.

1629
01:33:15,313 --> 01:33:17,384
I know where you are.

1630
01:33:29,327 --> 01:33:31,122
I know you"re close!

1631
01:33:32,641 --> 01:33:33,998
We gotta get to the cruiser.

1632
01:33:34,022 --> 01:33:36,656
I can"t die tonight,
my mom needs me.

1633
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,312
You"re not gonna die.

1634
01:33:38,336 --> 01:33:42,765
I got you into this mess, I"m
gonna get you out of it.

1635
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:43,939
I"m gonna be your diversion.

1636
01:33:43,963 --> 01:33:45,941
No, no, no!

1637
01:33:45,965 --> 01:33:48,405
I"m gonna get his attention so
you can get to the cruiser, ok?

1638
01:33:48,429 --> 01:33:49,164
Find a way out!

1639
01:33:49,188 --> 01:33:50,670
No! No, I can"t-

1640
01:33:50,694 --> 01:33:52,672
Hey, Wayne! Fuck you!

1641
01:33:52,696 --> 01:33:55,250
I am over here, you
fucking loser!

1642
01:34:21,103 --> 01:34:23,012
Stay the fuck there.

1643
01:34:23,036 --> 01:34:24,048
Woody! Woody!

1644
01:34:24,072 --> 01:34:25,729
He"s coming!

1645
01:34:27,109 --> 01:34:29,008
Woody!

1646
01:34:29,733 --> 01:34:31,400
Run!

1647
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,724
Davey! Davey!

1648
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:46,542
Davey! Davey!

1649
01:34:47,026 --> 01:34:49,867
No! No!

1650
01:35:30,794 --> 01:35:32,450
Woody! Woody!

1651
01:35:43,289 --> 01:35:45,577
You brought this on yourself.

1652
01:35:45,601 --> 01:35:48,235
All you had to do
was leave me alone.

1653
01:35:48,259 --> 01:35:50,306
This is your goddamn fault!

1654
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,100
I"m sorry.

1655
01:35:51,124 --> 01:35:53,620
I"m sorry.

1656
01:35:53,644 --> 01:35:56,796
You forced me out of my home.

1657
01:35:56,820 --> 01:36:01,939
You stole my life!

1658
01:36:01,963 --> 01:36:04,665
You do not get to be sorry.

1659
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:14,537
All I wanna do is kill you.

1660
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:18,438
That"s not enough for you.

1661
01:36:18,462 --> 01:36:25,997
You have spent so much
time thinking about me.

1662
01:36:26,021 --> 01:36:31,934
I want you to keep
thinking about me.

1663
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:35,869
I want you to imagine
what I am going to do

1664
01:36:35,893 --> 01:36:41,288
when I come back for you.

1665
01:36:41,312 --> 01:36:45,327
And I am going to
come back for you.

1666
01:36:45,351 --> 01:36:50,746
After you have spent your life
looking over your shoulder.

1667
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:53,818
After you have wondered
every single day

1668
01:36:53,842 --> 01:37:00,031
if that is the day that
I"m gonna come for you.

1669
01:37:00,055 --> 01:37:06,751
One day... you'll be right.

1670
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:50,950
You never know what might be
coming around the corner.

1671
01:39:53,332 --> 01:39:55,689
And that"s the thing
about this place.

1672
01:39:55,713 --> 01:39:58,761
It all might seem
normal and routine,

1673
01:39:58,785 --> 01:40:00,315
but the truth is

1674
01:40:00,339 --> 01:40:03,721
the suburbs are where the
craziest shit happens.

1675
01:40:22,568 --> 01:40:25,926
Just past the manicured
lawns and friendly waves.

1676
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:30,724
Inside any house, even
the one next door,

1677
01:40:30,748 --> 01:40:35,443
anything could be happening
and you"d never know.

1678
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,389
If I"ve learned anything,

1679
01:40:40,413 --> 01:40:43,934
it"s that people hardly ever let
you know who they really are.

1680
01:40:50,251 --> 01:40:53,264
Tough pill to swallow, I know.

1681
01:40:53,288 --> 01:40:55,808
But it"s true.

1682
01:40:59,294 --> 01:41:02,401
Even serial killers live
next door to somebody.
