00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,688
No we're in Germany.

Yeah we got you a present.

20
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:33,091
No we can't tell you what it
is, it's a surprise.

21
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:40,270
Oh yeah, the other thing is that 
we met this cut German waiter.

22
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,704
<i>Jenny thinks he's pretty cute</i>

23
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:47,331
<i>Yeah, and he invited us to a party

24
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,004
So we're going to go.

25

32
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,059
I think we were suppose to turn

33
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,633

34
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,098
I thought you know exactly
where we sere going!

35
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,151
Do we go left or right?

36
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,377
I'm sorry, but I just don't know
where we are.

37
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,291
What was that?

38
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,450
I have no idea.

39
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:10,130
You must have run over a pot whole or something.

56
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,454

57
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,881
There's always a signal.

58
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:15,593
Not out here in the middle of nowhere.

59
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,147

79
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,063
Do not understand what he says.

80
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:59,777
Um, can you call someone?

81
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:06,029

Is your door locked?

89
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,409
Yes, my door is locked.

90
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:34,350
Why's he still staring at us?

91
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:38,326
- Just don't look at him, okay?

We need to walk and find someplace, 
somebody who can help us.

97

How do you know?
All trees look the same.

00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:24,253
Leaving the car
is the stupidest idea.

103
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,411
We would have been waiting for hours, Jenny.

104
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,438

00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,541
I'll fetch a towel.

187
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,401
What just happened?

188
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:30,545
I don't know.

189
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,961
We need to get out of here right now.

190
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:38,643
Yeah.

191
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,440
It's freaking me out.

192
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,885
You want to? just call a taxi
so we can go back to the hotel.

193
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:19,892
Let's go back to the Hotel, okay.

194
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,275
- We'll get the car in the morning car.
- Okay. Yeah.

195
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,518
I am really tired.

196
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:12,667
Listen, If you could just call a taxi service,
we're just going to go back to the hotel.

197
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:16,344
No. I don't do another phone call.

198
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,918
Can I call you then?

199
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,053
No.

200
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:24,467
- I'm tired.
- What?

201
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:27,024
I'm tired.

202
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,791
What's going on?
Look at me.

203
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,091
It's a rape drug.

204
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:32,323
What?

205
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,615
Rohypnol.

206
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:35,128
Oh my God! What!

207
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:41,616
It causes, droziness, dizziness,
disorientation and memory loss.

208
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,398
Are you kidding?!
What have you done?

209
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,426
Jenny!
God!

210
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:48,444
What is it?

211
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:54,742
Jenny.

212
00:22:58,008 --> 00:22:59,196
Jenny.

213
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:02,655
Jenny!

214
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:08,003
Jenny!
Jenny, wake up!

215
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:09,098
Jenny!

216
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,704
God!

217
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:17,892
Jenny.

218
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:19,167
Lindsay!

219
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,094
Jenny!

220
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:35,310
What's happening?

221
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,027
What are you doing?

222
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,712
What's this?

223
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,944
What the fuck are you doing to us?

224
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:44,153
What are you doing?

225
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:45,652
Jenny!

226
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:47,369
Let us out!

227
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,478
My friend ...

228
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:09,583
You don't match.

229
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,190
Have to kill you.

230
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:29,244
Don't take it personally.

231
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:33,261
What 's this?
What are you doing to us?

232
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:39,451
What is this?
Stop!

233
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:43,557
Jenny!

234
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:15,140
Japanese

235
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:37,083
Please ...

236
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:49,252
It's gonig to be okay.

237
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:32,717
I'm Dr. Joseph Heiter.

238
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:33,997
Japanese

239
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:43,089
Retired but still very well known as 
the leading surgeon separating siamese twins.

240
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,590
Japanese

241
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,227
Six months,

242
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:53,641
I designed a never seen operation,
not separating anymore... 

243
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:55,052
but creating.

244
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:59,553
I transformed my three Rottweiler

245
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:04,399
into a beautiful three hound construction.

246
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,818
Good news!

247
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,947
Your tissues match.

248
00:29:09,177 --> 00:29:10,182
So ...

249
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:17,285
I will explain this spectacular operation
once.

250
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:19,970
We start ...

251
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,642
 with cutting the ligament patelar.

252
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:27,481
 The ligaments of the knee caps.

253
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:31,329
So knee extension...

254
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,455
is no longer possible.

255
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:37,705
Pulling from "B" and "C"

256
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:43,057
The central incisors,
and lateral incisors and Canines.

257
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:44,558
from the upper and lower jaws...

258
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:51,186
The lips from"B" and "C"...

259
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:55,180
and the anus of "A" and "B"...

260
00:29:55,951 --> 00:30:02,505
are cut circular along the boarder
between buttock and rectum.

261
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:07,541
The mucus retains so.

262
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:12,573
Two pet acellular grafts
 are prepaired

263
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:18,008
and lifted from the underlining tissue.

264
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:25,601
The shape incisions.

265
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:28,917
Below the chins, of "B" to "C"

266
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:32,136
up to their cheeks.

267
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:37,932
Connecting the circular skin parts...

268
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:40,576
of anus and mouth.

269
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:44,661
From "A" to "B"
and  "B" to "C".

270
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,662
Connecting...

271
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:52,063
the pet acellular grafts
to the chin/cheek incisions  .

272
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,040
Creating ...

273
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,299
a siamese triplet...

274
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,751
connected

275
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:07,894
by the gastrict system.

276
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:11,646
Ingestion by "A"

277
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:15,882
past through "B"

278
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,821
and excretion by "C".

279
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,018
A human centipede.

280
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:31,753
First sequence.

281
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:45,650
Here's your breakfast.

282
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:48,086
Japanese

283
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,488
general anesthesia.

284
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:26,010
Lindsay!

285
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,129
Jenny ...

286
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:48,225
I want my mom!

287
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:08,166
German

288
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:15,867
No!

289
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:00,394
<i>Open up!</i>

290
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,518
Please!

291
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:06,990
Stop!
Why do this?

292
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,184
Open!

293
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,993
Need help!
You're a sick man!

294
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,712
I am a sick man.

295
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:19,213
<i>HAHAHAHAHA!</i>

296
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,231
If you do not open immediately I will....

297
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:27,834
cut your knees

298
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:32,330
<i>and pull your teeth out
one by one!</i>

299
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,401
<i>without anesthesia.</i>

300
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:36,474
<i>It's your choice!</i>

301
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,691
Open the door!

302
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:46,447
<i>Open the door!</i>

303
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:27,483
Stop!

304
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:33,635
No!

305
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,565
Please!
Please!

306
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:30,868
Why do this?

307
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,236
Let me and Jenny go.

308
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,350
Please.

309
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,976
We'll give you anything.

310
00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:41,191
Anything you want,
just let us go.

311
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,626
Don't worry ...

312
00:36:45,627 --> 00:36:48,181
it's only a tranquilizer 

313
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:53,423
Keep your head very still.

314
00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:58,349
I don't want to loose one of yout precious eyes.

315
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:34,380
Just kill me!

316
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:38,743
Ahhhh.

317
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:58,079
One of my Rottweilers
tried to flee

318
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,913
just before the operation.

319
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:03,746
After I caught the dog....

320
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:06,974
He had to take the middle postion.

321
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,481
in this postion...

322
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:10,282
the healing pains...

323
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:14,182
are twice as intense.

324
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:18,993
Do you already regret your little escape.

325
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,514
In fact I'm thankful for it.

326
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:28,844
Because now I know definitely,
you are...

327
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:32,846
the middle piece!

328
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:37,083
Just kill me now.
I'd rather be dead.

329
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:40,609
Game Over.

330
00:39:32,226 --> 00:39:34,368
Damn.

331
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:37,543
power is cut of again..

332
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,376
Sorry!

333
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,377
Damn!

334
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:19,991
I'm so sorry.

335
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,812
Help!

336
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:18,656
my sweet centipede ...

337
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:27,449
Looks good.

338
00:49:29,406 --> 00:49:31,792
Heal well.

339
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,351
Suffering will be over soon.

340
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,950
Your in alot of pain, I know.

341
00:49:48,156 --> 00:49:49,264
Nice.

342
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:53,859
Okay.

343
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,763
better and better.

344
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:59,177
My Lead ...

345
00:49:59,378 --> 00:50:01,378
My Lead.

346
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:03,631
Hey, man.

347
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:05,819
Hey, man.

356
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:42,011
Japanese

357
00:52:31,095 --> 00:52:36,668
Japanese

358
00:53:56,143 --> 00:53:59,588
Take the newspaper and bring it to me.

359
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:02,847
Yeah, good boy.

360
00:54:07,133 --> 00:54:08,250

365
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:33,643

366
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:47,438
Then let's walk a little.

367
00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:48,247
Japanese

368
00:54:48,674 --> 00:54:49,952
Atention!

369
00:54:53,597 --> 00:54:59,533

You want me to bite?
