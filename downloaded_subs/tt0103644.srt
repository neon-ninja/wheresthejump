1
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,720
Stasis interrupted.
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

2
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,120
Repeat,
fire in cryogenic compartment.

3
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,920
All personnel...

4
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,200
report to emergency
escape vehicle launch pod.

5
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,840
Deep-space flight will commence
in T-minus twenty seconds.

6
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,040
Get going!

7
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Jesus Christ!

8
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,720
Hell of a way to land!

9
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,000
Get the torch.

10
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,960
How many?

11
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Don't know. Three, maybe four.

12
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,400
Frank, can we hurry?

13
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,720
It's going to be
forty below in five minutes.

14
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,520
Aah!

15
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm going to kill that thing.

16
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,960
That stupid dog
of yours. Get it out!

17
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,880
I hate that thing.
Get rid of the dog.

18
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,040
He's gone.

19
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,200
Not a bad way to go, huh?
Ha ha ha.

20
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Frank, let's go!

21
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
Wait!

22
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,320
One of them's still alive.

23
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,840
All right.
We'll need all of those.

24
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,480
That's it. OK. All right.

25
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,320
This is rumor control.
Here are the facts.

26
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,240
As some of you know,
a 337 model EEV...

27
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,920
crash-landed here
at 0600 on the morning watch.

28
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,480
There was one survivor...

29
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,280
two dead, and a droid
that was smashed beyond repair.

30
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,320
The survivor is a woman.

31
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,640
Is she pretty?

32
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,240
I've taken a vow of celibacy.

33
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,520
So have we all!

34
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
That also includes women.

35
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,800
We've all taken the vow!

36
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,680
I'd like to say I do not
appreciate Company policy...

37
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,040
allowing her to intermingle
with inmates and staff!

38
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,480
What brother means is we view
the presence of any outsider...

39
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,720
especially a woman,
as a violation of the harmony...

40
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,920
a potential break
in the spiritual unity.

41
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,600
We're aware of your feelings
in this matter.

42
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,120
You will be pleased to know
I have requested a rescue team.

43
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,040
Hopefully, they will be here
inside of a week...

44
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,880
and evacuate her ASAP.

45
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,640
Don't give us that!

46
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,520
What's her medical status?

47
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,440
She's not badly damaged.

48
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,560
She's unconscious.

49
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,160
I can't be more specific now.

50
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
Will she live?

51
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,920
I think so.

52
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,120
It's best for all that
she stay in the infirmary...

53
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,960
until the rescue team arrives.

54
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,400
And certainly not
without an escort, right?

55
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
Sir.

56
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,360
Gentlemen!

57
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,160
We should all stick
to our set routine...

58
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,880
and not get unduly agitated,
correct?

59
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
All right.

60
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,040
Thank you, gentlemen.

61
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,720
All right.

62
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,000
Better get here soon,
or there won't be much left.

63
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,080
What's that?

64
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,360
Just a little cocktail
of my own mix. An eye-opener.

65
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,120
You a doctor?

66
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,040
My name is Clemens.

67
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
I'm Chief Medical Officer here.

68
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,200
-Here?
-Fury 161.

69
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,320
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's
backwater work prisons...

70
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
it grieves me to say.

71
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,760
Do you mind?

72
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,560
It's basically a stabilizer.

73
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,320
I ought to shave your head.

74
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,600
We have a big problem
with lice.

75
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,600
I'll give you some clippers
for your private parts.

76
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
How did I get here?

77
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,760
You crash-landed in an EEV...

78
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
evidently separated
from your mother ship...

79
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,560
before you hit our atmosphere.

80
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,480
How long were you in hyper sleep?

81
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,680
Coming out that way
can jolt your system.

82
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,840
I'll be sick
for a couple of weeks.

83
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,960
Indeed.

84
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,440
Where are the others?

85
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
They didn't make it.

86
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,320
-What?
-They didn't survive.

87
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,320
I have to get to the ship.

88
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,000
Have to get to the ship.

89
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
You're in no condition.

90
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,040
Want to get me some clothes,
or should I go like this?

91
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,640
Given the nature of
our indigenous population...

92
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,400
I would suggest clothes.

93
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,160
They haven't seen a woman
in years.

94
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,560
Neither have I, for that matter.

95
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,160
This used to be
a 5,000-convictfacility...

96
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,520
but it's been reduced to a
custodial staff of twenty-five.

97
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,960
-Why?
-Keep the pilot light on.

98
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,480
Pilot light for what?

99
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,840
Blast furnace. Natural methane.

100
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,480
We have a foundry,
Lieutenant Ripley.

101
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,640
The inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containment.

102
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,320
How do you know my name?

103
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,960
It's stenciled
on the back of your shorts.

104
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,160
Hey! Pick them up!

105
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,720
Release the cable!

106
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,720
Where are the bodies?

107
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,120
We have a morgue.

108
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,120
We put them there until
the investigators arrive...

109
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,440
in about a week.

110
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
There was a droid.

111
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,480
Disconnected. There
were pieces of him all over.

112
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
We put what was left
on the rubbish tip.

113
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,800
The corporal was impaled
by that safety support.

114
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,760
He never knew what hit him.

115
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
And the girl?

116
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,480
She drowned in her cryo-tube.

117
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
I don't think
she was conscious...

118
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,720
when it happened.

119
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Um, I'm sorry.

120
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,640
What's the matter?

121
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,840
-Where is she?
-In the morgue.

122
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,200
I have to see her.

123
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,040
I have to see
what's left of her.

124
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,920
God, there you are!

125
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,360
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

126
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,920
Where you been, huh?

127
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,080
Come here.

128
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,280
You OK?

129
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,920
Let me see, Spike. Are you OK?

130
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,360
Let me see.

131
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,680
What have you been
sticking your face into?

132
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,600
Did somebody do this to you?

133
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,400
What kind of animal
would do this to a dog?

134
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
Um...

135
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,360
could I have a moment alone,
please?

136
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,480
Yes, of course.

137
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,080
Forgive me.

138
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,040
What's she doing?

139
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
OK?

140
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,680
No.

141
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,800
We have to do an autopsy.

142
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,520
-What?
-I told you.

143
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,760
We have to make sure
how she died.

144
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,280
And I told you she drowned.

145
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,280
I'm not so sure. I...

146
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,200
I have to see inside of her.

147
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,880
You're disorientated.
Half your system-

148
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,080
I have a very, very good reason.

149
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Perhaps you'd like to share it.

150
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,440
Possible contagion.

151
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,200
What kind, exactly?

152
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
-Cholera.
-Cholera?

153
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,200
There hasn't been a case of
cholera for two hundred years.

154
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,560
Please.

155
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,880
Everything's in place.

156
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,200
There's no sign of infection.

157
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,320
No indication of disease.

158
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,240
Chest. Open the chest.

159
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
Careful.

160
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Lungs.

161
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,160
Flooded with fluid.

162
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
Ergo, she drowned.

163
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
Now, since I'm not
a complete idiot...

164
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,920
want to tell me
what we're really looking for?

165
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,080
Mr. Clemens.

166
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,360
Superintendent.

167
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,840
I don't believe you've met
Lieutenant Ripley.

168
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,640
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

169
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,800
That's right, sir.
What's going on?

170
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,360
Well, first...

171
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,080
the lieutenant is feeling
much better, I'm happy to say.

172
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,280
Second, in the interest
of public health...

173
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,560
I am performing an autopsy.

174
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,880
Without my authority?

175
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,200
There didn't seem to be time,
but it's turned out all right.

176
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,640
-There's no contagion.
-Good.

177
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,280
It might help if she didn't
parade before the prisoners...

178
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,680
as I'm told she did
in the last hour.

179
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,440
It might also be helpful
if you kept me informed...

180
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,360
as to any change
in her physical status.

181
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
Is that asking too much?

182
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,920
We have to cremate the bodies.

183
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Nonsense. We'll keep them on ice
till the rescue team arrives.

184
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,640
On ice.

185
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,240
There is
the public health issue.

186
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,640
The lieutenant feels
there's still the possibility...

187
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
of a communicable infection.

188
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,320
You said there was
no sign of disease.

189
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,480
It appears the child drowned...

190
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,000
but without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests...

191
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,840
it's impossible to be
absolutely certain.

192
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,720
I would consider it unwise
to tolerate...

193
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,680
even the possibility
of an unwelcome virus.

194
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,000
An outbreak of cholera...

195
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,960
would look extremely bad
on a report, would it not, sir?

196
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,120
Ahem.

197
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,600
We've twenty-five
prisoners in this facility...

198
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
all double-Y chromos...

199
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,640
all thieves, rapists, murderers,
child molesters...all scum.

200
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,040
Just because
they've taken on religion...

201
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,280
doesn't make them
any less dangerous.

202
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,680
I try not to offend
their convictions.

203
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,080
I don't want to upset the order.

204
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,040
I don't want ripples
in the water...

205
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,840
and I don't want a woman walking
around giving them ideas.

206
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,360
I see.
For my own personal safety.

207
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,400
Exactly.

208
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,680
I'll leave the cremation details
to you, Mr. Clemens.

209
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,480
They may use the furnace...

210
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,480
but I want everyone in lockup
by 2200 hours.

211
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,120
"We commit this child
and this man...

212
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,240
"to Your keeping, O Lord."

213
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,000
"Their bodies have been taken...

214
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,240
"from the shadow of our night."

215
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:18,000
"They have been released
from all darkness and pain."

216
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,440
"The child and the man...

217
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,880
"have gone beyond our world."

218
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,120
"They are forever...

219
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,840
"eternal, and everlasting."

220
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,080
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

221
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,080
Why?

222
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,480
Why are the innocent punished?

223
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,800
Why the sacrifice?

224
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,360
Why the pain?

225
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,680
There aren't any promises.

226
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,960
Nothing's certain.

227
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,800
Only that some get called...

228
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,880
some get saved.

229
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,080
She won't ever know
the hardship and grief...

230
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,320
for those of us left behind.

231
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,160
We commit these bodies
to the void...

232
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,120
with a glad heart.

233
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,680
For within each seed...

234
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,960
there is a promise of a flower.

235
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,680
And within each death,
no matter how small...

236
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,160
there's always a new life.

237
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,640
A new beginning.

238
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,080
Amen.

239
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
Amen.

240
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,240
It's fucking weird.

241
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,960
Only a woman
survived that crash.

242
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,120
What trouble can she cause?

243
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,040
She's already
changed everything.

244
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,320
What are we
supposed to do with her?

245
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,040
I mean it.

246
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,160
Not around here,
that's for sure.

247
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,360
Hello.

248
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,440
I just wanted to...

249
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,000
say thanks for what you said
at the funeral.

250
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,640
My friends
would have appreciated-

251
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,800
You don't want to know me, lady.

252
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,760
I'm a murderer
and rapist of women.

253
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,000
Really.

254
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,720
Well, I guess
I must make you nervous.

255
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,480
Do you have any faith, sister?

256
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,040
Not much.

257
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,400
We've got a lot of faith here.

258
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,840
Enough even for you.

259
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,440
I thought women weren't allowed.

260
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,560
We've never had any before,
but we tolerate anybody...

261
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,000
even the intolerable.

262
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,000
Thank you.

263
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,880
That's just a statement
of principle, nothing personal.

264
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,040
We've got a good place
to wait here.

265
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,400
And until now...no temptation.

266
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,400
Dillon and the rest
of the alternative people...

267
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,520
embraced religion, as it were,
about five years ago.

268
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,040
Take two.

269
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,560
I'm on medication?

270
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,680
Hardly.

271
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,200
What kind of religion?

272
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,000
Some sort of
apocalyptic, millenarian...

273
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,120
Christian fundamentalist...

274
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,680
-Right.
-Exactly.

275
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,640
When the Company
wanted to close the facility...

276
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,200
Dillon and the rest
of the converts wanted to stay.

277
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,040
They were allowed
to remain as custodians...

278
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,320
with two minders
and a medical officer.

279
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,080
And here we are.

280
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,080
How did you get
this wonderful assignment?

281
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,120
How do you
like your new haircut?

282
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,120
It's OK.

283
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,640
Now that I've gone out on a limb
for you with Andrews...

284
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,000
damaged my less-than-perfect
relationship with him...

285
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,040
and briefed you on the humdrum
history of Fury 161...

286
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,480
can't you tell me
what you were looking for?

287
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,120
Are you attracted to me?

288
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,560
In what way?

289
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,480
In that way.

290
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
You're very direct.

291
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,760
I've been out here a long time.

292
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,400
In the year 7510

293
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,960
If God's a-comin',
he oughta make it by then

294
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,520
Maybe he'll look around and say

295
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,600
Guess it's time
for the judgment...

296
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,560
Yecchh!

297
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,240
In the year...

298
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,680
Hey, Spike.

299
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,880
Spike? Spikey.

300
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,840
Are you down there?

301
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,000
What are you doing?

302
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Aah!

303
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,920
I really appreciate
your affections.

304
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,160
But I am aware
that they deflected my question.

305
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,680
In the nicest possible way,
of course.

306
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,120
You're spoiling the mood.

307
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
I have a job to do.

308
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,680
I want to know why we had
to cremate the bodies.

309
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,600
I had a terrible dream
in hyper sleep...

310
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,640
and I had to be sure
what killed her.

311
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,760
Anyway, I made a mistake.

312
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,640
Possibly.

313
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,600
Now I've made another.

314
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,440
What's that?

315
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,360
Fraternizing with a prisoner.

316
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,920
Physical contact.

317
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,800
It's against the rules,
isn't it?

318
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm not a prisoner.

319
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,960
You have a bar code
on the back of your head.

320
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,480
That does deserve
an explanation.

321
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,320
Now is not the moment.

322
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,080
Mr. Clemens.

323
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,280
Mr. Aaron.

324
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,160
Superintendent Andrews
would like you to report...

325
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,040
to vent shaft twenty-two
on the second quadrant-now.

326
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,480
We've had an accident.

327
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,640
Something serious?

328
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,560
You could call it that.

329
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,840
One of our prisoners
has been...diced.

330
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
Sorry.

331
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,720
I have to go.

332
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,120
Official duties.

333
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,760
Who was it?

334
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,080
Murphy.

335
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,200
How do you know?

336
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,920
That's his boot.

337
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,040
I gave him the assignment, sir.
He was a wanker.

338
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,080
No apologies, Mr. Aaron.
It wasn't your fault.

339
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,120
Not much to say, is there?

340
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,720
Death was instantaneous.

341
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,840
No shit.

342
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,160
He was pulled into the fan?

343
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,160
Sudden rush of air, except-

344
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,240
Right.
Almost happened to me once.

345
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,720
I've told them so many times,
"Stay away from the fans."

346
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,440
Nobody bloody listens.

347
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,800
Except the fan was blowing.

348
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
-What's that?
-I don't know.

349
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,040
I want to see you
in my quarters in 30 minutes.

350
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,880
Got any ideas?

351
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,240
Here you are.

352
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,600
Wandering around unescorted...

353
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,200
is really going to piss
Superintendent Andrews off.

354
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,520
Want to tell me
about your accident?

355
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,440
A prisoner has been killed.

356
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,880
-Really?
-Hmm.

357
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,200
-How?
-In the air shaft.

358
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,520
Poor sod
backed into a nine-foot fan.

359
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,880
I found something
at the accident site...

360
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,160
just a bit away
from where it happened.

361
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,400
A mark.

362
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,560
A burn.

363
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Rather like the one you found
on the girl's cryo-tube.

364
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,920
Look...I'm on your side.

365
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,280
I want to help, but I need
to know what's going on...

366
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,200
or what you think is going on.

367
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,480
If you really want to help...

368
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,440
find a computer
with audio capabilities...

369
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,040
so I can access
this flight recorder.

370
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,040
We don't have anything
like that.

371
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,440
What about Bishop,
the droid that crashed with me?

372
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,960
I can point you
in the right direction.

373
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,440
I can't join you.

374
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,240
I have a previous engagement.

375
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,360
Listen to me,
you piece of shit.

376
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,240
You screw with me again,
I'll cut you in half.

377
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,360
I'm sorry.
I don't think I understand.

378
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,200
At 0700 hours, I received
word from the network.

379
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,200
This is the first
high-level communication...

380
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,680
this installation has ever
received, to my knowledge.

381
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,120
They want this woman
looked after.

382
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,400
They consider her to be
high-priority.

383
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,960
-Why?
-I have no idea.

384
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,840
Why did you let her
out of the infirmary?

385
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,160
This accident with Murphy...

386
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,960
is what happens when one
of these dumb sons of bitches

387
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,520
walks around with a hard-on.

388
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,800
I'm a doctor.
You're the jailer.

389
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,720
We both know exactly
what you are.

390
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,080
Sit down.

391
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,560
It might be better if I left.

392
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,040
I find you
unpleasant to be around.

393
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,400
You do? Isn't that lovely?
Consider this, Mr. Clemens.

394
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,520
Would you like me to explain
your sordid history...

395
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,600
to your newfound friend?

396
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,360
For her personal edification,
of course.

397
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,200
Now sit the hell down.

398
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,040
Now...is there anything
I should know?

399
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,920
Aah!

400
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,800
Shut up! Fucking bitch.

401
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,400
Shut up, you bitch.

402
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,560
Goddamn it, let go of me!

403
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,280
Fuck you!

404
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,840
No!

405
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,000
Shh, shh, shh.

406
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,760
No, goddamn it!

407
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,480
Aah!

408
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,280
Aah!

409
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,520
You OK?

410
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,840
You son of a bitch!

411
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,240
Take off. I got to re-educate
some of the brothers.

412
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,480
We got to discuss
some matters of the spirit.

413
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,520
This is like ten city blocks.

414
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,200
How many?

415
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,720
This makes
one hundred seventy-six.

416
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,160
Can't you chew a little quieter?

417
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm trying to figure out
how big this compartment is.

418
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,600
I can't think
with this goddamn noise.

419
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,400
You're not supposed to swear.

420
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm sorry.

421
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,840
We've encircled
this entire compartment once.

422
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,400
-Hey!
-What?

423
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,560
What the shit is doing that?

424
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,720
Swearing.

425
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,920
It's OK to say "shit."
It ain't against God.

426
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,360
What the hell is going on
with the candles?

427
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,240
Must be the wind
from one of the vent shafts...

428
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,200
backwash from the closest
circulating unit.

429
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,920
If they go out, we'll be lost.

430
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,200
Somebody
will have to re-light them.

431
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,800
Guess I'm nominated.

432
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,720
Watch your step, brother.

433
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,080
OK, who are the comedians?

434
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,840
Aah! Aah!

435
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,760
Aah!

436
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,400
Go!

437
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,840
Aah!

438
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,960
Come on! Quick! Grab it! Here!

439
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,280
Help me!

440
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,320
Go! Fucking go!

441
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Go on! Quick!

442
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,120
Run!

443
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,600
Aah!

444
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,840
Give me that.

445
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,440
Aah!
Get this fucking thing off me!

446
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,600
Aah!

447
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,600
Let me go!

448
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,440
-Aah!
-No!

449
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,200
Hey.

450
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
Hello, Ripley.

451
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,480
Hi, Bishop.

452
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,480
How you feeling?

453
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,640
My legs hurt.

454
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,200
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

455
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,000
It's OK.
I'm just a glorified toaster.

456
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,760
How are you?

457
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,440
Ah, I like your new haircut.

458
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,680
Can you access
the flight recorder?

459
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,920
No problem.

460
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,200
I'm home.

461
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,280
What happened on the Sulaco?

462
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,840
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?

463
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,320
Stasis interrupted.

464
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,480
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

465
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,000
Repeat. Fire in cryogenic-

466
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,080
What happened?
What started the fire, Bishop?

467
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,760
Can you hear me?

468
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,960
The fire was electrical.

469
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,120
It was in the sub flooring.

470
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,000
Did sensors find anything moving
on the ship before separation?

471
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,160
It's very dark here.
I'm not what I used to be.

472
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,680
Just tell me. Does
the recorder indicate anything?

473
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,800
Was there an alien on board?

474
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,120
Yes.

475
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,520
Is it on the Sulaco?

476
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,440
Did it come in the EEV?

477
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
It was with us all the way.

478
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,520
Does the Company know?

479
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,440
The Company knows everything
that happened on the ship.

480
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,600
It all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to network.

481
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,400
Then they want it.

482
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,040
I hurt. Do me a favor.
Disconnect me.

483
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,000
I could be reworked, but I'll
never be top-of-the-line again.

484
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,640
I'd rather be nothing.

485
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,040
You're sure?

486
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,840
Do it for me, Ripley.

487
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,320
It wasn't me!

488
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,480
I didn't do it!

489
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,600
It was-It was the dragon.

490
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,040
Feeds on minds.

491
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,880
Nobody can stop it.

492
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,360
What about Boggs and Rains?

493
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,280
Got slaughtered like pigs.
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

494
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,680
Stark raving mad.

495
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,640
It's no one's fault, but
he should've been chained up.

496
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,520
You called it, sir.
Mad as a fucking hatter.

497
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,880
Keep him separated
from the rest.

498
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,720
Don't want him causing a panic.

499
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,880
Clemens, sedate this poor idiot.

500
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Not until we know
about the brothers.

501
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,160
Now, now,
pull yourself together.

502
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,120
Talk to me now.

503
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,480
Where are Boggs and Rains?

504
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,080
Hopeless. You won't
get anything out of him.

505
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,880
We'll send out a search team.

506
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,240
We'll have to assume
this bastard murdered them.

507
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,040
You don't know that.

508
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,040
He's never lied to me.

509
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,120
He's crazy, he's a fool,
but he's not a liar.

510
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,440
He's telling the truth.

511
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,480
I'd like to talk to him
about this-this dragon.

512
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,000
It's a dragon.

513
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,320
You're not talking
to anyone, Lieutenant.

514
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,240
I'm not interested
in your opinion.

515
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,560
You don't know the facts.

516
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,400
He's a convicted
multiple murderer...

517
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,760
known for particularly
brutal crimes.

518
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,440
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?

519
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,200
Yeah...that part's right.

520
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,920
Then I'll talk to you.
It's important.

521
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,720
When I'm finished
with my official duties...

522
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,400
I'll be pleased
to have a little chat. Yes?

523
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,120
Let me see if I have
this correct, Lieutenant.

524
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,920
It's an eight-foot creature
with acid for blood...

525
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,000
and it arrived
on your spaceship.

526
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,320
It kills on sight
and is generally unpleasant.

527
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,880
You expect me
to accept all this?

528
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,280
No, I don't expect anything.

529
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,640
Quite a story, Mr. Aaron.

530
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,760
Right, sir. It's a beauty.

531
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,520
Never heard anything like it.

532
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,880
Expect not.

533
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,960
Tell me, Lieutenant,
what would you suggest we do?

534
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,560
What kind of weapons
have you got?

535
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,960
This is a prison.

536
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It's not good to allow prisoners
access to firearms.

537
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,800
Keeps them from killing you.

538
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,680
Yeah. There's no way to escape.

539
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,880
When the supply ship arrives,
the Company will eliminate it.

540
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,440
This is
a maximum security prison...

541
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,360
and you have no weapons
of any kind?

542
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,960
We have carving knives
in the abattoir...

543
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,480
a few more in the mess hall...

544
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,560
some fire axes scattered
about the place.

545
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,920
That's all?

546
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,360
We're on the honor system.

547
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,480
Then we're fucked.

548
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,520
No, you're fucked.

549
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,800
Confined to the infirmary.
Quarantined.

550
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,480
Mr. Aaron will escort you.

551
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,080
You'll be safe from any large,
nasty beasts while you're there.

552
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,720
That's a good girl.

553
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:36,800
Report to the mess hall.
Andrews wants a meeting.

554
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,376
Mess hall right away, people.

555
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:41,190
Isn't there any way
off of this place...

556
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,870
some way to escape?

557
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,030
No.

558
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,190
Supply ship
comes every six months.

559
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,590
-That's it?
-That's it.

560
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,950
Fuck.

561
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,670
They're sending
somebody to pick you up soon.

562
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,270
Really? What's soon?

563
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,710
I don't know.

564
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,870
Nobody's ever been in a hurry
to get here before.

565
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,190
Do you want to tell me what
you and Andrews talked about?

566
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,470
No.

567
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,390
You'd just say I'm crazy.

568
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,630
That's a bit uncharitable.

569
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,070
How are you feeling?

570
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,350
Not so hot. Ahem.

571
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,950
Sore throat, sick to my stomach,
pissed off.

572
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,670
That's understandable,
given the circumstances.

573
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,030
Perhaps I should give you
one of my special cocktails.

574
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,910
Why does everybody
blame everybody?

575
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:47,470
Nobody's perfect.
We're only human.

576
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,550
I don't know a perfect human.
Nobody I know.

577
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:52,910
You married?

578
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,310
Me?

579
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,110
Get married, have kids.

580
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,590
Pretty girl.

581
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,070
I used to know
lots of them back home.

582
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,790
They used to like me...

583
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,270
for a while.

584
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,750
You're going to die, too.

585
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,710
Are you?

586
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,310
What?

587
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,510
Married.

588
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,750
Why?

589
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,190
Just curious.

590
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,910
No.

591
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,150
How about leveling with me?

592
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,910
When I asked
how you got assigned here...

593
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,630
you avoided the question.

594
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:48,190
When I asked about the prison
I.D. tattooed on your head...

595
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,510
you ducked me again.

596
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,710
It's a long, sad story...

597
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,790
and more than
a little melodramatic.

598
00:51:58,830 --> 00:51:59,950
Try me.

599
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:03,990
If you insist.

600
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:10,710
After my student years...

601
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:18,550
despite the fact that I'd become
secretly addicted to morphine...

602
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,270
I was considered
to be most promising-

603
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:20,790
I was considered
to be most promising-

604
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,470
a man with a future.

605
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:29,270
During my first residency, I did
a 36-hour stretch in E.R...

606
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,430
so I went out, and I got
more than a little drunk.

607
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,430
Then I got called back.

608
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,470
Boiler had blown
in a fuel plant...

609
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,190
and there were
thirty casualties.

610
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,030
Eleven of them died...

611
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:44,870
not from the accident...

612
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,750
but because I prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller.

613
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,990
I got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3-C.

614
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,510
At least I got off the morphine.

615
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,630
I'm sorry.

616
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,430
I think I was let off lightly.

617
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,310
You served your time here?

618
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,950
I got to know
this motley crew quite well...

619
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,590
so when they stayed, I stayed.

620
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,630
Nobody else would employ me.

621
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,590
Do you still trust me
with a needle?

622
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,270
Aah!

623
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,390
Once again,
this is rumor control.

624
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,230
Here are the facts.

625
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,230
At 0800 hours,
prisoner Murphy...

626
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,950
through carelessness
on his part...

627
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,630
was found dead in vent shaft 17.

628
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,270
He seems to have been sucked
into a ventilator fan.

629
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:04,110
At about 2100 hours...

630
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:08,190
prisoner Golic reappeared
in a deranged state.

631
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,430
Prisoners Boggs and Rains
are missing.

632
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:14,950
There seems to be a good chance
they have met with foul play...

633
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:18,150
at the hands of prisoner Golic.

634
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,710
We need to organize
and send out a search party.

635
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,190
Volunteers will be appreciated.

636
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:33,670
It's fair to say
our smoothly running facility...

637
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,790
has suddenly developed
a few problems.

638
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,990
I can only hope we are able
to all pull together...

639
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,270
over the next few days
until the rescue team...

640
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,190
arrives for Lieutenant Ripley.

641
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,390
It's here. It got Clemens.

642
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,030
-Stop this raving.
-I'm telling you, it's here!

643
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,910
Get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary.

644
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,470
Aah!

645
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:06,590
Fuck!

646
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,910
What do we do now?

647
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,230
Who's in charge?

648
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:19,230
Organize!
We got to organize, right?

649
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,910
Right. I guess I'm next in line.

650
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,790
Eighty-five's in charge? Jesus!

651
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,390
Don't call me that.

652
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,790
There's no way
I can replace Andrews.

653
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,430
He was a good man.
You didn't appreciate him.

654
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,630
Aaron, we don't want
to hear that shit now.

655
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,910
Sister, what about you?

656
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:38,270
You're an officer.
Show us a little leadership.

657
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:41,550
Forget Shirley Temple.
You take charge.

658
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,990
You run things here anyway.

659
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,390
No fucking way.
I'm not the officer type.

660
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,670
I just take care of my own.

661
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:53,710
What does
this fucking beast want?

662
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,670
Is this mother
going to try for us all?

663
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,950
-Yeah.
-Jesus!

664
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,390
Ain't that sweet?

665
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,150
How do we stop it?

666
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,230
Ahem.

667
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,710
We have no weapons, correct?

668
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,310
Right.

669
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,910
I haven't seen one
exactly like this before.

670
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:18,150
Moves differently.

671
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:24,110
But the others were afraid
of fire, not much else.

672
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,150
Can we seal off this area?

673
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,350
No chance.

674
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,030
The installation's
ten miles square.

675
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,350
There's six hundred air ducts.

676
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,630
What about video?

677
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,190
I see closed-circuit
monitors everywhere.

678
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,950
The video system
hasn't worked in years.

679
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,150
Nothing much works here.

680
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,550
We've got a lot of technology,
no way to fix it.

681
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:47,110
Eighty-five is saying we've got
no entertainment center...

682
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,830
no climate control,
no video system...

683
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:52,510
no surveillance, no freezers...

684
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:57,150
no fucking ice cream,
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

685
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,630
All we got here is shit.

686
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:04,870
What are we talking to her for?
She brought the fucker.

687
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:08,230
Why don't we shove her head
through the fucking wall?

688
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:10,790
Morse?

689
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,310
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

690
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,910
Right.

691
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,790
Right.

692
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,630
What will we do?

693
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:43,950
What's this?

694
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,030
Leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary.

695
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,310
It's a ventilation shaft.

696
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:53,470
Then we go in there.
Flush it out.

697
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:56,950
There's miles and miles
of tunnel through there.

698
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,030
It won't go far.

699
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,830
It'll nest in this area.

700
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,830
Right around...

701
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,590
here.

702
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,390
How do you know that?

703
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,510
It's like a lion.

704
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,790
It sticks close to the zebras.

705
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,310
Zebras?

706
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,790
Oh, right.

707
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,430
But running around in the dark-
are you kidding?

708
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,270
Once you get out the main shaft,
there's no overheads.

709
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,990
Don't we have flashlights?

710
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,710
Thousands, but no batteries.
Nothing works.

711
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:31,510
Torches? Do we have
the capacity to make fire?

712
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:36,550
Most humans have enjoyed that
privilege since the Stone Age.

713
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,310
No need to be sarcastic.

714
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,630
Never been used.

715
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:44,750
They meant to dump
nuclear crap there.

716
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,830
Never did. It's clean inside.

717
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,310
This the only way in or out?

718
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,710
That's right.

719
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,990
Walls are six-feet-thick,
solid steel.

720
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,990
Really knew how to build
these babies.

721
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,990
You're saying we get
something in there...

722
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,910
there's no way it can get out?

723
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:03,750
That's right. No fucking way.

724
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,990
This is where we keep it.
I forget what it's called.

725
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,310
Quinitricetyline.

726
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,470
I knew that.

727
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,430
Right. I've got to get
these section arrangements...

728
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:21,030
organized with Dillon
for the paintbrush...

729
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,390
so, um...

730
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,950
-David.
-You organize these drums.

731
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,310
Right, Eighty-five.

732
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,190
And, uh, don't call me that.

733
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,870
What's this "Eighty-five" thing?

734
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:41,110
Couple of us sneaked a look
at his personnel file.

735
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,430
It's his I.Q.

736
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:54,190
I saw a drum of this stuff fall
into a beachhead bunker once.

737
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:57,070
The blast put a tug in dry dock
for seventeen weeks.

738
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,230
Great stuff!

739
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:05,670
Let me get this straight.

740
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:10,470
You want to burn it down
and out of the pipes...

741
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,830
force it in here, slam the door,
and trap its ass?

742
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:14,910
Right.

743
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:18,790
And you want help
from us Y-chromo boys?

744
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,670
Got something better to do?

745
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,390
Why should we put our ass
on the line for you?

746
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,630
Your ass is already on the line.

747
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:27,070
The only question is...

748
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,630
what will you do about it?

749
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,750
What is this stuff?

750
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,510
Man, this stuff stinks!

751
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,150
So you miss Doc, right?

752
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,510
What makes you say that?

753
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,590
I thought you two
got real close.

754
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,670
I guess you've been looking
through some keyholes.

755
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:10,430
That's what I thought.

756
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,790
Oh!

757
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:19,550
I hate this place.

758
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,390
There's definitely
something in here with us.

759
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,510
Don't light the fire
until I give the signal.

760
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:33,950
This is the signal.

761
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:37,070
Got it? Can you remember that?

762
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,310
Aah!

763
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,950
Aw, shit!

764
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,750
Aah! Aah!

765
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,510
Aah!

766
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:34,830
B...

767
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,230
Wait for the fucking signal!

768
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,110
Get down!

769
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,670
Aah!

770
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:58,430
We got to find the sprinklers!

771
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,070
We got to help these guys!

772
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,670
Aah!

773
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,150
Come on!

774
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:14,070
Get to the waste dump!
Don't open the door!

775
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,430
Dillon, over here.
Here's another one.

776
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,110
Aw, Jesus. This makes ten.

777
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,870
Fucking great!

778
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,550
Now what are we going to do?

779
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,350
You OK?

780
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,550
Piss on her!

781
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,470
The fucking thing's loose.
What do we do?

782
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,230
I said that,
you miserable shit!

783
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,390
Cut that shit out.

784
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,830
Tell your fucking bozo
to shape up!

785
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,790
What do you think?

786
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,910
I think I have to get
to the EEV.

787
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,670
Why? What's up?

788
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,950
I just have to use
the neuroscanner.

789
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:56,430
You don't look good.

790
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,390
Who cares? What do we do?

791
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,910
Want a smack in the mouth,
wanker?

792
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:03,070
Shut the fuck up.
Stop causing panic!

793
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:05,470
Panic? You're so stupid,
you couldn't spell it.

794
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:07,310
We ought to fucking panic!

795
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,150
Shut up, both of you!

796
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,310
Shut up!

797
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,190
Well, I'm out of ideas!

798
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,790
Surprise me.

799
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,470
What about outside?

800
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:32,670
Sun's not up for
two days. It's forty below zero.

801
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,830
The rescue team's
ten hours away.

802
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:38,310
You want to let this thing
have us for lunch?

803
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,950
I want you to get everybody
that's left together.

804
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,270
Go down to the furnace.

805
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,750
OK.

806
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,910
Need any help?

807
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,470
I didn't mean to scare you.

808
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,390
You shouldn't
wander around alone.

809
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,190
Do me a favor
and run this keyboard, will you?

810
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,870
OK.

811
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,790
What do I do?

812
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:42,590
Hit "B" or "C."

813
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,750
What's "C"?

814
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,910
"Display biofunctions"?

815
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:47,190
That's it.

816
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,270
OK, we're hot. Now what?

817
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,870
Let it run a cycle.

818
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,310
It's real fuzzy.

819
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:58,830
Hit enhancement.

820
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,750
Keep looking.

821
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,750
I don't know
how to read this stuff.

822
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:31,990
Hemorrhaging
will show as a dark patch.

823
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,110
Look for...

824
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,950
hairline fractures
through the base of the skull.

825
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,470
Little white lines.

826
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:54,830
What is it?

827
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,190
I think there's one inside you.

828
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:02,950
That's not possible.

829
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,870
What does it look like?

830
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:13,870
Horrible.

831
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:15,790
I have to see it.

832
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,390
Freeze it.

833
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,310
-You don't want to see.
-Freeze it!

834
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,670
I'm sorry.

835
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,750
It's up.

836
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:58,990
What do you want to say?

837
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,470
Tell them
the whole place is toxic.

838
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:04,590
Are you kidding?

839
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,590
Then the rescue team
will turn back.

840
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:08,550
Yeah. I know.

841
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,110
What are you talking about?

842
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:12,630
Our only hope
is that they kill this fucker.

843
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,110
Maybe they can do
something for you-

844
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,550
freeze you, an operation.

845
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:18,870
They've got the technology.

846
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:21,190
If this organism
gets off the planet...

847
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,030
it'll kill everything.

848
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,350
The Company doesn't care
about that.

849
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:28,350
They just want it
fort heir bio-weapons division.

850
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,550
So we can't let them come here.

851
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,070
Fuck you.

852
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:35,910
I'm sorry you've got
this thing inside you...

853
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,990
but I'm getting rescued.

854
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,670
I don't care
about the prisoners.

855
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,630
I've got a wife, a kid.
I go home next rotation!

856
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,310
I know this is hard.
I'm going to send this message.

857
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,670
I need that fucking code.

858
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,590
I'm sorry, ma'am.
It's classified.

859
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:51,990
Listen, you stupid little shit!

860
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:55,830
This has got to be done.
There are no alternatives!

861
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:58,870
You're not getting it!
No fucking way!

862
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,430
Look...

863
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,190
it's nothing personal,
understand?

864
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,670
I think you're OK.

865
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,790
Thanks.

866
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:27,630
Have you got any ideas?

867
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:30,910
I don't know.
Maybe I'll go find it.

868
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:33,110
We'll see how smart it is.

869
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,310
You're going to look for it?

870
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,150
Yeah.

871
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:40,030
I have a pretty good idea
of where it is.

872
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,630
It's just down there...

873
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:44,750
in the basement.

874
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:46,830
This whole place is a basement.

875
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:49,910
It's a metaphor.

876
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:52,990
Want to come?

877
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:57,750
Fuck me.

878
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,710
Where are you when I need you?

879
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,230
Don't be afraid.

880
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,190
I'm part of the family.

881
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:06,470
You've been in my life so long,
I can't remember anything else.

882
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:10,590
Now do something for me.

883
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:13,910
It's easy.

884
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:15,750
Just...

885
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,110
Just do what you do.

886
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,790
Oh!

887
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,750
It won't kill me.

888
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,550
You're supposed to be
laying low.

889
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,510
I have one inside of me.

890
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,710
What are you talking about?

891
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,630
I saw it on the CAT scan.

892
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:16,710
It's a queen-

893
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,070
an egg-layer.

894
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:22,190
It can make thousands more
like the one here.

895
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:25,030
Still sounds like bullshit
to me.

896
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:28,710
If that thing's inside you,
how did it get there?

897
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:35,190
When I was in hyper sleep,
I guess.

898
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,630
I don't have much time...

899
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,670
and I can't do what I should.

900
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,190
I need you to help me.

901
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:51,950
I need you to kill me.

902
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,710
What are you talking about?

903
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,390
I'm dead anyway.

904
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:58,790
I can't survive it...

905
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:03,270
but the one inside me
can generate thousands more.

906
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,190
It has to die...

907
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,390
so somebody's got to kill me.

908
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,110
Are you up to it?

909
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:17,390
You don't have
to worry about that.

910
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:35,910
No speeches.

911
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:40,910
No prayers.

912
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,470
-What's going on?
-I don't like losing a fight.

913
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,270
Not to nobody, not to nothing.

914
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,670
That damn thing out there has
already killed half my men...

915
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,110
got the other half
scared shitless.

916
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,270
As long as it's alive, you're
not going to save any universe.

917
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:28,110
You said you'd kill me.

918
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,990
You fucking coward!

919
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,390
I want to get this thing,
and I need you to do it.

920
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,510
If it won't kill you,
maybe that helps us fight it.

921
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,510
Otherwise, fuck you!

922
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:47,790
Dillon?

923
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:53,230
We waste this thing,
then you take care of me.

924
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,470
No problem.

925
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:59,070
Quick, easy, and painless.

926
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:04,110
You die sitting here on
your ass, or you die out there.

927
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:06,990
At least we take a shot.
We owe it one.

928
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:08,870
What are you talking about?

929
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,550
Killing that big motherfucker!

930
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:14,710
Doesn't mean we should
fight it. Give us a break!

931
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,910
You have to be nuts!
I've got a wife-

932
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:19,590
Nobody cares about you,
Eighty-five.

933
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:23,070
You're not a believer.
You're a fucking Company man!

934
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:27,470
OK, I'm a Company man
and not a fucking criminal.

935
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,950
You keep telling me I'm dumb.

936
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:32,150
I'm smart enough
not to have a life sentence!

937
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,830
Fuck you!

938
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,310
I'm smart enough to wait
for firepower to show up...

939
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:39,230
before we fight this thing!

940
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:42,830
Right.
Just sit on your asses. Fine.

941
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,670
How about if I sit here
on my ass?

942
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,790
No problem.

943
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,710
Oh, I forgot.

944
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,870
You're the guy that's made
a deal with God to live forever.

945
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:57,790
And all the rest of you pussies
can sit it out, too.

946
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,670
Me and her
will do all the fighting.

947
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:03,990
OK. I want to see it dead, too.

948
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:08,070
I hate the fucker!
It killed my mates, too!

949
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:11,710
Why the fuck can't we wait
to have guns on our side?

950
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:14,750
Why go on
some fucking suicide run?

951
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,350
Because they won't kill it.

952
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,790
They might kill you
just for having seen it.

953
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,710
That is crazy!

954
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,950
That is horseshit!
They will not kill us!

955
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,470
When they first
heard about this thing...

956
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,630
it was "crew expendable."

957
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,510
The next time,
they sent in Marines.

958
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:36,230
They were expendable, too.

959
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:40,030
What makes you think they'll
care about a bunch of lifers...

960
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:42,670
who found God
at the ass-end of space?

961
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:46,150
You think
they're going to let you...

962
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:48,390
interfere with their plans
for this thing?

963
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,950
They think we're-
we're crud.

964
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:55,230
They don't give a fuck
about one friend of yours...

965
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:56,990
that's-that's died.

966
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:59,190
Not one.

967
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,070
Have you got a plan?

968
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,710
This is a lead works, isn't it?

969
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:11,470
All we got to do is lure
the beast into the mold...

970
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,830
drown it in hot lead.

971
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,070
Right. How do we do that?

972
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:20,270
What are we
going to use for bait?

973
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,750
Aw, fuck!

974
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:30,070
You're all going to die.

975
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:34,350
The only question
is how you check out.

976
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:37,630
Do you want it on your feet...

977
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:42,750
or on your fucking knees...
begging?

978
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:45,430
I ain't much for begging.

979
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:47,190
Nobody ever gave me nothing...

980
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:49,790
so I say fuck that thing!

981
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:51,230
Let's fight it!

982
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:57,550
Fuck it!

983
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:58,990
Let's go for it!

984
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:00,910
OK.

985
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,030
Fuck me.

986
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:03,910
Let's kick its fucking ass.

987
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:06,310
What if it runs at us?

988
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:08,310
That's a fucking good idea.

989
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,790
When did you use
this place last?

990
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:20,190
We fired it up five,
six years ago.

991
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:22,190
You sure the piston
is gonna work?

992
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,510
There's nothing for sure
in this place.

993
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,390
We trap it here first,
then you pull the lever.

994
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:34,510
The piston will push
the motherfucker into the mold.

995
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,190
One of the guys
will pour the lead.

996
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:38,150
End of story.

997
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,630
What if somebody screws up?

998
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:42,430
We're fucked.
You got one chance.

999
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,470
We'll never have time
to reset it.

1000
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:49,310
Remember, when you pull
the lever, for a few seconds...

1001
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:51,750
you'll be trapped in here
with that fucking thing.

1002
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,590
If you guys don't drop the ball,
I won't.

1003
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,470
You better be right about
that thing not wanting you.

1004
01:22:57,510 --> 01:23:00,270
Because if it wants out,
that's how it's going to go.

1005
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,310
Through that alcove,
through you.

1006
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,350
Where are you going to be?

1007
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:05,790
I'll be around.

1008
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:07,710
Where are the others?

1009
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,310
Praying.

1010
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:13,630
-I have a problem with this.
-What part?

1011
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:17,630
Running around in a dark maze
with that thing chasing us.

1012
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:20,830
Lead it down channel "B"
to the piston chamber.

1013
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,630
I'll close the doors behind you.

1014
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:29,310
What if it won't cooperate?

1015
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:31,190
What if we get lost?

1016
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:36,310
This was her idea.

1017
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:53,430
I don't know about this shit.

1018
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,950
Hey, guys!

1019
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,870
My door ain't working!

1020
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:00,150
What the fuck's he saying?

1021
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:02,190
I think we'd better
rethink this thing!

1022
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:15,710
Did anybody hear anything?

1023
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:30,230
Come on!
Come and get me, you fucker!

1024
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:32,870
It's behind me!

1025
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:35,190
It's started.

1026
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:37,910
It's still behind me!

1027
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,550
It's in channel "B"!

1028
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:43,950
You guys! Shut the doors!

1029
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:46,270
Must be heading
over to channel "A"!

1030
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:53,710
This thing is really pissed off!

1031
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,590
-Did you say "B"?
-No, "E"!

1032
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,310
-You said to stay here!
-Move your fucking ass!

1033
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,550
Morse?

1034
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,070
Kevin?

1035
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:16,510
Yoo-hoo!

1036
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,230
Hey, fuckface!

1037
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:19,430
Come and get me!

1038
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:22,990
Take your best shot!

1039
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,630
Kevin, where are you?

1040
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:30,910
A-7 closed.

1041
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:34,070
Aah!

1042
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,870
Over in the east wing!

1043
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:39,550
Door B-7 safe!

1044
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,950
-You, too?
-Yeah!

1045
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,350
Over to "E," everybody!

1046
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,510
-Where the fuck is "E"?
-This way!

1047
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:16,590
Here...

1048
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:17,950
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1049
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:19,510
Here, kitty, kitty.

1050
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:23,590
Oh, my God.

1051
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,510
Oh, my...

1052
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:26,990
You bastard!

1053
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,270
It's coming!

1054
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:32,310
It's coming down!
Jeez, it's coming!

1055
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,510
It's after us!

1056
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,630
Shut the fucking doors!
That was the plan!

1057
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,030
Jesus,
it's on the fucking ceiling!

1058
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:44,190
Dillon! Anybody!
This is not a drill!

1059
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:46,390
Kevin! Gregor!

1060
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:48,790
Where the fuck are you?

1061
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:53,270
Now we're back in "A"!

1062
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:10,070
Door three, "F" channel closed!

1063
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:12,630
I hope.

1064
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,070
Fuck.

1065
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,670
-What the fuck are you doing?
-What?

1066
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:19,590
Don't hold it like that.
Hold it like this.

1067
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:21,190
You'll fucking kill someone,
you moron!

1068
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:27,510
Aah!

1069
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:28,870
Morse!

1070
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:31,150
Kevin!

1071
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:34,150
Gregor!

1072
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:36,750
All they have to do
is run down the corridor.

1073
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:38,870
Stay here.

1074
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:43,950
Where the hell is it?

1075
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:20,430
Aah!

1076
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,030
Aah!

1077
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,350
No! Don't start the piston!

1078
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:37,350
No! We have to trap it! No!

1079
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,390
What are you doing? It's gone!

1080
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:41,670
No! No.

1081
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:44,910
It's gone.

1082
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,870
OK?

1083
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:49,910
OK.

1084
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:56,830
Uhh.

1085
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:19,510
Aah!

1086
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,710
Kevin! Don't struggle!

1087
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,710
Don't move! No!
Don't struggle.

1088
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:36,950
Come on, Kevin! Come on!

1089
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:39,270
Come on! Come on!

1090
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:42,190
It's coming!

1091
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,550
Take the piston!

1092
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:50,030
Come on, it's all right.
It's OK.

1093
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:52,430
It's OK. It's all right, Kevin.

1094
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,110
Kevin. Kevin!

1095
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,630
Kevin.

1096
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:05,790
Leave him.

1097
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:08,030
Leave him. He's dead.
Lure it in.

1098
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:23,710
Shit. How much time?

1099
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,630
I'm not sure.
Four or five minutes.

1100
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,190
We've got to get it back in here

1101
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:29,430
before the piston
seals this place up!

1102
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:30,750
Let's move it!

1103
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,550
Help me!

1104
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:01,110
Jude!

1105
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:05,190
Dillon!

1106
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:07,110
Help me, Dillon!

1107
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:08,750
It's coming at me!

1108
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,710
Don't look back, Jude!
Run as fast as you fucking can!

1109
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,830
Help me! God! Please!

1110
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:44,510
Jesus Christ!
Thank God you're here.

1111
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:50,670
Warder Aaron, sir. 137512.
Not many of us left.

1112
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:54,390
Where is Lieutenant Ripley?
Is she still alive?

1113
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:56,550
If she's alive,
she's in the furnace.

1114
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:00,110
She's in the lead works
with the beast.

1115
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:01,270
Wouldn't wait.

1116
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:17,550
Jesus Christ.

1117
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:19,470
You fucker. Scared me shitless!

1118
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:23,590
I thought you were
the fucking beast, you fuck!

1119
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,390
Aah!

1120
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,950
Wanker!

1121
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:53,710
Move.

1122
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,190
Come on, you bastard.

1123
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:04,150
Come on!
Come on, get out of there!

1124
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:06,230
Come here!

1125
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:10,990
Ripley,
we're running out of time!

1126
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:18,510
Ripley, where are you?

1127
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:38,590
No!

1128
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:48,990
Come on.

1129
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:51,030
Get out of there!

1130
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:53,430
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1131
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:54,990
Let it go!

1132
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:56,190
Ripley.

1133
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,710
Yeah! It's working!

1134
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:00,670
Scream. Let it follow us.

1135
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:02,830
We got to get it
in front of the piston.

1136
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,030
It's following us!

1137
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:08,190
Motherfucker, come on!

1138
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:10,510
Come and get us! Come on!

1139
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:12,710
Come on, come on.

1140
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,830
Come on, motherfucker! Come on.

1141
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:17,870
Come on! Get the door!

1142
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,030
Get the door!

1143
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,550
Morse!

1144
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:24,430
-Now!
-Shut it, Morse!

1145
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:28,190
Morse! Shut that door!

1146
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,830
-Now!
-Shut the fucking door!

1147
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,110
I'm going for the lead!

1148
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:13,870
-What about you?
-I'm staying.

1149
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:16,190
Bullshit! There'll be
ten tons of hot lead in here.

1150
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:17,870
I want to die!

1151
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:19,750
We got a deal! Remember?

1152
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:21,870
It dies first, then you!

1153
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:24,630
I'm not moving without you!
Now get going!

1154
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,030
Dillon!

1155
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,430
I've got to hold it here.

1156
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,830
What about me?

1157
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:45,390
God will take care of you now.

1158
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:47,270
No!

1159
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:49,110
Pour the lead.

1160
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:57,430
Fuck you.

1161
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:01,750
-No!
-Pour it, Ripley!

1162
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,590
Go on!

1163
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,550
God damn it!

1164
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:08,990
Pour the lead, Ripley!

1165
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:11,110
Come on!
Come on, that's all you got?

1166
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:13,590
Fight, motherfucker! Come on!

1167
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,910
Morse!

1168
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:16,270
Morse, over here!

1169
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:21,030
-Ripley!
-Pour the lead!

1170
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:23,910
Pour the lead!

1171
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:25,630
Pour it!

1172
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:36,230
Aah!

1173
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:17,990
Ha ha ha!

1174
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:20,550
I hate bugs!

1175
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:48,990
Ripley! It's burning hot!

1176
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,310
Hit the sprinklers!

1177
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:54,390
Douse the fucker!

1178
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:05,510
Ohh!

1179
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:27,590
Gotcha!

1180
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:29,550
Yes!

1181
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:34,110
Don't come any closer.

1182
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:36,110
Wait. They're here to help.

1183
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,590
Stay where you are.

1184
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:41,510
Ripley.

1185
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,990
Bishop?

1186
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:45,030
I'm here to help you.

1187
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,310
No more bullshit.

1188
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:48,910
I just felt it move.

1189
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:50,790
You know who I am?

1190
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:53,190
You're a droid,
same model as Bishop...

1191
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:55,110
sent by the fucking Company.

1192
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:58,550
No. I'm not the Bishop android.

1193
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:00,670
I designed it.

1194
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,750
I'm very human.

1195
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:06,110
The Company sent me here
to show you a friendly face...

1196
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:09,190
to demonstrate
how important you are to us...

1197
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:11,430
to me.

1198
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:12,830
You want to take it back.

1199
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:14,630
We want to kill it
and take you home.

1200
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:15,750
Bullshit.

1201
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:18,990
You're wrong. We want to help.

1202
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:20,870
What does that mean?

1203
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,470
We're going
to take that out of you.

1204
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:25,990
And keep it?

1205
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:27,390
Can't let it live.

1206
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:29,870
Everything we know
would be in jeopardy.

1207
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:34,070
You don't want to take it back?

1208
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:35,870
Ripley, time is important.

1209
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:39,510
We've got a surgical bay
on the rescue ship.

1210
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:40,670
Come with me.

1211
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:44,710
You still can have a life.

1212
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:47,750
Children.

1213
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:52,350
Most important,
you'll know it's dead.

1214
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:53,830
Let me help you.

1215
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:57,510
What guarantee do I have...

1216
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,470
once you've taken it out...

1217
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:04,110
that you'll destroy it?

1218
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:06,750
You'll have to trust me.

1219
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:12,990
Please?

1220
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:14,910
Trust me?

1221
01:41:19,110 --> 01:41:20,350
No.

1222
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:32,510
What's this going to achieve?

1223
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:34,470
-Aah!
-Stop!

1224
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:36,430
Aw, Jesus!

1225
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:38,390
Aah! Aah!

1226
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,550
Morse.

1227
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:43,070
Will you help me?

1228
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:45,870
What do you want me to do?

1229
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:52,190
It was a mistake!
There was no need for any of it!

1230
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:53,510
Fucking android!

1231
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:14,430
Ripley, think of all
we could learn from it.

1232
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:17,510
It's the chance of a lifetime!

1233
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:19,150
You must let me have it.

1234
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,790
It's a magnificent specimen.

1235
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:43,910
What are you doing?

1236
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:49,510
No!

1237
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:05,270
-Come on, you, get going.
-Aw, fuck you!

1238
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,430
Ash, Captain Dallas.

1239
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,750
Cargo and ship destroyed.

1240
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:22,470
I should reach the frontier
in about six weeks.

1241
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:25,710
With a little luck,
the network will pick me up.

1242
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:28,270
This is Ripley...

1243
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:31,150
last survivor of the Nostromo...

1244
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:33,550
signing off.
