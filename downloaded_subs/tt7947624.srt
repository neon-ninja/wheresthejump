2
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:35,665
Ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,737
The Producers of this picture
thought it would be only fair

4
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:46,375
To give you ample warning of
what you are about to witness

5
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:50,947
This motion picture contains
elements of horror,

6
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,115
Terror,

7
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:53,883
and.... Demonic possession.

8
00:00:55,784 --> 00:01:00,823
So, if you are of a weak
disposition or easily offended,

9
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,592
please leave this screening at
once.

10
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:09,064
The management will be more than
happy to refund your tickets.

11
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:17,672
Have they gone?

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,441
Good.

13
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:25,780
Those of you who are brave
enough to stay

14
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,950
You have been warned.

15
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,087
So, without any further ado

16
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:34,956
It is my pleasure,

17
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,558
Or should I say displeasure?

18
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:41,628
To present our feature
presentation...

19
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:28,365
Have we passed Westwood Station?

20
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:31,735
Oh, no, no, two more stops.

21
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,545
No need to fret, pilgrim, just a
force of habit is all.

22
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:46,283
Care for a gut warmer?

23
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,888
Woah! Strong stuff!

24
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:55,291
Takes some getting used to I
guess.

25
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,794
George Walker

26
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,362
Oh! George Walker?

27
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:02,231
Not THE George Walker, the
American oil tycoon?

28
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:05,001
I would have had you as being
much older.

29
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,203
You're thinking of my Pa.

30
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,072
Ah... so you are

31
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:11,773
A Junior.

32
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,910
I don't think I got your name.

33
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,312
Jeffrey Bank.

34
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,746
Pleasure, I'm sure.

35
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:21,950
So, what's a Yank oil man doing
in this part of the world?

36
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:24,319
I'm visiting an old friend from
my Oxford days

37
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:29,157
He just acquired a 'Westwood
Manor'

38
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:32,394
What? You didn't have me pegged
for an Oxford scholar?

39
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:35,197
No no no... it's just Westwood
Manor

40
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:37,199
Now that is interesting.

41
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,699
Interesting how?

42
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:41,236
Oh no its just... local gossip

43
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:44,772
I wouldn't want to waste your
time with all that nonsense

44
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,042
Well, until this train pulls
into Westwood Station

45
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:50,211
I got all the time in the world

46
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:53,080
Spin me your nonsense.

47
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:54,482
Well then... I mean

48
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:59,353
Westwood Manor has stood empty
for most of it's life

49
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,720
People have come and gone

50
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:03,823
But they've never stayed more
than a year or two.

51
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:09,062
Then a few winters back a strange
individual took up residency

52
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,697
He never went into the village

53
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:12,799
He was something of a hermit

54
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,267
And then, ah, well,

55
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:16,703
The noises started

56
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:19,706
And every night the noises got
louder,

57
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:21,875
and more terrifying

58
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:27,180
The villagers wouldn't even
leave their homes after nightfall

59
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:29,115
And then, just as suddenly

60
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:31,117
The noises stopped

61
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:35,121
And the house stood silent and
empty once more.

62
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:37,190
And the hermit? What became of
him?

63
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:38,857
Well no one knows

64
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:41,294
But the villagers were so
terrified...

65
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:47,432
Even the bravest will not enter
that house to this day

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,734
You can't try frightening me,

67
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,438
You English folk are as slow as
a Sunday afternoon

68
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,374
My station's just coming up

69
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,811
It's been very nice passing a
bit of time with you.

70
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:04,982
And, ah...

71
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,752
Tread carefully, Mr Walker

72
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:11,822
You're not in Texas any longer.

73
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,802
Must you drive so fast?

74
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,040
Cars are built for speed.

75
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:31,875
No point driving if you're gonna
go slow.

76
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,512
But you know that it makes me
nervous.

77
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,380
We're all going to die,
Elizabeth

78
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:40,116
The one thing we can choose is
if we do it with style.

79
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:44,187
And crashing into a ditch is
with style?

80
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,724
Very well

81
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,127
Thank you.

82
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,333
What's the matter?

83
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,169
You've barely spoken since we
left London

84
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:01,804
Nothing, I'm fine

85
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,108
You're a terrible liar, you know
that?

86
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:10,346
I wish we weren't coming this
weekend.

87
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,982
Why?

88
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:15,150
What are you afraid of?

89
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:18,153
What if nobody likes me?

90
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,389
How could anyone dislike you?

91
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,591
You're simply charming.

92
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:24,260
Well I'm not exactly...

93
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:27,329
Not exactly what?

94
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:30,499
I'm just a solicitor's secretary

95
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:34,002
I'm not in the oil business,
or...

96
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:37,205
A famous tennis player

97
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:41,509
A famous tennis player who hasn't won
a match in the last two tournaments

98
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:43,211
At that rate my dear

99
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:47,915
You're far more successful than
me.

100
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:29,289
Christine.

101
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:31,391
Hello George.

102
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,393
I didn't see you board the train
at Paddington

103
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,195
Been some time.

104
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:38,097
Hasn't it?

105
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,266
How have you been keeping?

106
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,902
Just fine, thank you.

107
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,338
Well you look as pretty as a pie
supper

108
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:46,939
How are you?

109
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,008
Better now.

110
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,443
Shall we head inside?

111
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,678
Inquire about a car?

112
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,447
After you.

113
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:55,481
Let me take your bags.

114
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:58,149
I'm sure I'll manage.

115
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,503
It's magnificent

116
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,538
And it's all Victor's?

117
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:24,542
Yes, his father was a very rich
man

118
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:26,511
They despised each other.

119
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:27,645
Why?

120
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:30,080
He disagreed with Victor's
lifestyle

121
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:32,082
Too much time in restaurants and
clubs

122
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,618
And not in libraries and
university

123
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:36,086
But then he died

124
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:39,022
And left Victor a small fortune.

125
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,225
Can't say he's been spending it
wisely

126
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,393
What do you mean?

127
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,395
Victor is a creature of appetite

128
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:47,231
But he also has a very short
attention span.

129
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:49,433
Fads come and go.

130
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,602
A few months ago it was all
about Polo

131
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,970
Then it was hot-air
ballooning...

132
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:56,507
And now it's this house.

133
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:59,375
God knows what will be next.

134
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,178
It's rather sinister isn't it?

135
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:39,147
Yes... I suppose it is.

136
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:43,218
Come. Let's go find our host.

137
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:16,182
Hello??

138
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,786
Freddie, old boy!!

139
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,521
Well, what do you think?!

140
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,656
I love what you've done with the
place

141
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,692
You know you really should put
me in touch with a decorator

142
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:27,260
My apartment has far too many
upright walls.

143
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:29,128
Ha ha! Oh very funny

144
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:30,230
How are we?

145
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:31,564
Oh much better now that you're
here

146
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:33,266
And this must be... Elizabeth

147
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,234
Elizabeth Barton

148
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,001
How do you do?

149
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,269
Very good to see you!

150
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:37,237
This house is...

151
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:38,338
Terrible.

152
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:40,507
What on earth possessed you to
buy it?

153
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:41,541
All in good time, but first

154
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:44,209
Let me show you to your
quarters.

155
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,144
Then we can crack on with some
serious drinking

156
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:49,348
Don't mind if I do!

157
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:02,628
The Master Bedroom!

158
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,364
How cosy.

159
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,698
It's a little run down

160
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:08,600
But the bed seems to be in
perfectly good order.

161
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,669
Thank you.

162
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:12,371
Well, we'll leave you in peace!

163
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,105
Freddie, I'll show you your room

164
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,475
Drinks in about... half an hour.

165
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,678
Just this way, Freddie

166
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:14,463
George! You big American
bastard!

167
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:15,865
Wonderful to see you again!

168
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:17,834
You too.

169
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:20,202
What the hell happened here?

170
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,237
It's a work in progress old boy.

171
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:25,174
And my dear sister... how are
we?

172
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,308
Vicky.

173
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,278
Um, is something wrong with my
hand?

174
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:31,246
Oh my god you're right!

175
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:33,415
Drinks in ten minutes everyone.

176
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:36,485
Let me show you to your quarters

177
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:39,655
Mind the, uh, debris...

178
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,230
Not ready yet?

179
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,431
Oh! You startled me

180
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:53,735
I'm sorry... need help with my
cufflinks.

181
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,404
Rather silly, a grown man who
still can't do his own.

182
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,306
Luckily you have me to help.

183
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,608
Yes... about that.

184
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,578
I was wondering if you'd always
like to help me with my cufflinks.

185
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,345
What do you mean?

186
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:08,816
I'm asking you to marry me you
little fool.

187
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:10,685
Really?

188
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,352
Yes. Not the most romantic way
to ask, I know

189
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,756
But there you go.

190
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,858
Well?

191
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,825
I don't know what to say...

192
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,294
Well... yes of course

193
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,929
Yes!

194
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,297
Good girl.

195
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,633
Now that's settled you should
really get changed.

196
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,570
Victor hates to be kept waiting.

197
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,420
Here we are.

198
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,587
Thank you

199
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,657
And Bourbon, no junk for our...

200
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,992
Transatlantic friend

201
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,460
Now you're talking!

202
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,995
Where's Freddie?

203
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,430
Is he late?

204
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,298
I believe he's changing

205
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,536
I heard he's got a new pet

206
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,371
Now now Christine we must not -

207
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,674
Ah, speak of the devil!

208
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,742
Look what the cat dragged in!

209
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,710
Hello old boy, it's been a
while.

210
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,846
Ain't it just

211
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,714
Christine... a pleasure

212
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,385
I'm afraid I'm simply too weary
from my journey to stand.

213
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,520
Of course, how rude of me

214
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,055
This is Elizabeth Barton

215
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:27,859
Elizabeth, this is George
Walker, Junior

216
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,994
Pleasure to meet you little lady

217
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,696
And allow me to introduce

218
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:34,531
my darling sister, Christine.

219
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,767
How do you do?

220
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,369
I'll be right as rain as soon as
I finish this

221
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,437
And Elizabeth...?

222
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:41,472
Oh, no thank you

223
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:44,976
I don't drink.

224
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:50,347
How very proper.

225
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,485
Well isn't this nice!

226
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,986
All of us, back together again

227
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:58,088
Like the good old days!

228
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:01,759
Here's to a weekend in the
country

229
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:04,427
Cheers!

230
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:18,107
Is this safe to eat?

231
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,611
Haven't had the chance to hire
any staff I'm afraid.

232
00:16:21,677 --> 00:16:26,381
This is the product of my
afternoon in the kitchen

233
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:29,351
Oh god, well in that case this
is a miracle.

234
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,787
Well Victor

235
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:32,021
You may have let us down in the
kitchen

236
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,356
But you certainly made up for it
in the cellar

237
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:37,894
This 1895 Chateaux Palmer is a
wonderful wine

238
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,095
Well drink up everyone

239
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:42,731
there's plenty more where that
came from.

240
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:46,368
Oh, I am sorry there wasn't
anything apart from water for you.

241
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:48,837
Water's fine, thank you.

242
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:49,905
I must say, Elizabeth

243
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:52,040
It's a pleasure to finally meet
you.

244
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:54,643
Freddie's normally so shy about
introducing us to his friends.

245
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,511
Well I've been so busy with
practice lately

246
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,814
I've hardly been off the court.

247
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,715
You know I think there's a
tennis court

248
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:02,117
somewhere on the grounds

249
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:04,451
Maybe we could have a game
tomorrow

250
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:08,522
By the sounds of it you need all
the practice you can get!

251
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:11,725
To hell with you.

252
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,694
So how did you two meet?

253
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,397
Arthur Brown's Christmas party
drinks.

254
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,933
You've been keeping her hidden
since Christmas?!

255
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:20,134
Poor show.

256
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:21,602
Well, didn't want to give you
any ideas

257
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:23,637
Did I, old boy?

258
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:25,940
And what do you do?

259
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,041
Christine.

260
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:29,710
What? Can't I ask her anything?

261
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:30,476
A secretary.

262
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:31,812
A mute one, no doubt?

263
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,581
For a solicitor.

264
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:39,485
And what does being a
solicitor's secretary involve?

265
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:42,856
Mostly arranging meetings,

266
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:46,926
and typing letters. That sort of
thing.

267
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,700
But my real passion is writing

268
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,567
Well what sort of writing?

269
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:58,171
Are we in the presence of the
next Jane Austen?

270
00:17:58,238 --> 00:17:59,605
No I don't think so

271
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,639
More Shelley than Austen

272
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,108
Oh please...

273
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:04,143
Well come on, tell us more!

274
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,844
It's not very interesting

275
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:09,047
Oh no it sounds simply
fascinating

276
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:11,850
We all wanna know!

277
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:15,988
Well... it's a ghost story of
sorts

278
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:20,826
And what happens in this ghost
story of sorts?

279
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,695
It's about a girl.

280
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:26,530
A little girl who is raised in
an orphanage

281
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:29,567
And she's haunted by ghosts

282
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:33,171
Only as she grows up, and the
story continues

283
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:37,074
She realises that ghosts aren't
the ones to fear.

284
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:42,480
Well what are the ones to fear?

285
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:47,652
The humans.

286
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:54,624
Oh! I am so sorry
Elizabeth!

287
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,558
Oh no it's fine!! No don't
worry...

288
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,895
No don't... don't!

289
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:01,498
Don't worry Victor

290
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,434
It was only a cheap dress.

291
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,755
Is everything alright Elizabeth?

292
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:29,159
I'm... I'm fine

293
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:33,128
It was an honest accident

294
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:39,601
Just let me clean myself up.

295
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:54,882
...eventually we reached the
summit

296
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,188
Even though we walked downhill -

297
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:03,325
Elizabeth, I am so sorry for
before

298
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:06,060
Not to worry

299
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,098
So... Christine

300
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:12,133
I don't think I heard

301
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,969
What is it that you do exactly?

302
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,972
Do??

303
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,842
Well darling, I do this!

304
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,611
And you do it better than anyone
else could!

305
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:26,713
Oh you're too kind

306
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,915
How very... rewarding

307
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:30,351
I'm sure.

308
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:33,253
Oooh! Christine you better watch
out

309
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:37,591
This one's got claws!

310
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:40,560
Shut up Victor.

311
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:43,330
If I may be so bold

312
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:45,631
I'd like to make a toast.

313
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:49,835
Oh, everyone, charge your
glasses!

314
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:04,383
Proceed.

315
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:07,119
Well I wasn't planning on saying
anything just yet

316
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:08,788
But, why not?

317
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:10,856
Seeing as we're all here

318
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:14,226
And maybe this wine has got the
better of my senses

319
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:16,896
But we're engaged

320
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:18,830
We are to be married

321
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:20,166
I say!

322
00:21:20,232 --> 00:21:21,766
Congratulations

323
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,001
Congratulations

324
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,936
Thank you

325
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:28,106
Congratulations.

326
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:41,419
Christine.

327
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:43,188
Hello again.

328
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:44,389
Did you receive my letters?

329
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:45,656
Yes...

330
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,924
Well I didn't get a reply

331
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:49,394
No. I thought it would be
kindest that way.

332
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:50,528
Kindest?

333
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:53,198
What would you know about
kindness?

334
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:55,099
Well the last time we saw each
other

335
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:57,301
You were telling me you never
wanted to see me again

336
00:21:57,368 --> 00:22:00,938
Can't a man change his mind?

337
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:02,873
I must say...

338
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,274
When I read your first letter

339
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:06,076
I was very surprised when I got
to the end

340
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:07,311
and saw it was from you.

341
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:09,712
Why? Who else would it be from?

342
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Does it matter?

343
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:11,548
They were all signed

344
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:15,718
George Walker Junior.

345
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:20,823
Don't call me Junior.

346
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,459
I must say, George

347
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:24,760
That's a very big knife.

348
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:29,298
I do hope you're not trying to
compensate for something.

349
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:35,104
How about a game of bridge?

350
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:36,705
No no...

351
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:41,043
I have specially arranged
entertainment for us this evening.

352
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,447
What time is it?

353
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:47,150
Nine twenty-five

354
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:49,485
Good. She should be here soon
then.

355
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:51,119
Who should be here soon?

356
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:54,222
All will be explained shortly.

357
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:59,794
Yes... but let us retire to the
games room!

358
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,173
Well, sit, sit

359
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,375
Make yourselves comfortable.

360
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:15,510
Oh, would anyone like a drink?

361
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:17,912
Whiskey, neat.

362
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:19,747
I'll have one too, with ice.

363
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:21,516
I think we have some sherry...

364
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,750
Sherry?

365
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:23,451
Sherry.

366
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:25,152
Sherry... Sherry?

367
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:26,754
Sherry? No I...

368
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,123
Elizabeth doesn't drink,
remember?

369
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,158
Of course, how silly of me

370
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:34,228
I'll just fetch you some water.

371
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,431
Whiskey, no junk.

372
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:41,368
So old boy. Save the
theatrics...

373
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:43,002
What's this all about?

374
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:44,704
Well...

375
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:52,845
If you're so determined to ruin
my fun

376
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,319
This is no ordinary house.

377
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:05,158
This house was owned by

378
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:08,394
Ichabod Quinn!

379
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:13,765
Who?

380
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:19,972
I'm not sure how much you know
about the world of the paranormal

381
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,241
But over the past few months
I've become

382
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,209
quite fascinated by it

383
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:27,479
What, ghosts and monsters? That
sort of nonsense?

384
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:29,248
Exactly.

385
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:31,516
But I wouldn't call it nonsense.

386
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:36,221
What's all this got to do with
this Ichabod character?

387
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:38,557
Mr Quinn was one of the greatest
occultists

388
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:39,991
who ever lived.

389
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:45,096
He pushed the boundaries of
magic to its utmost limit

390
00:24:45,162 --> 00:24:49,967
Going further than anyone else
before

391
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:55,506
He was also a painter

392
00:24:55,573 --> 00:25:00,311
He would take various substances in
order to connect with the other side

393
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:03,381
Once in a trance-like state, he
would begin

394
00:25:03,447 --> 00:25:05,683
to paint what he saw.

395
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:13,957
But when he fell gravely ill, he wrote to his mentor
that he was close to acheiving his life's work

396
00:25:14,024 --> 00:25:23,133
"After years of searching... my
quest has come to an end...

397
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:30,540
I have found the birthplace...
of desire and destruction

398
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:35,645
Tonight, under the eye of the
moon

399
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:41,418
I will pull back the veil of
this world

400
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:48,223
And go to the utter blackness

401
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,495
I am close, so very close.

402
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:59,168
Close to what?

403
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:03,037
A gateway to the other side

404
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,574
Then one day he vanished

405
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:08,076
Never to be seen again

406
00:26:08,142 --> 00:26:10,945
Legend has it that if a séance
is conducted

407
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:14,315
one can raise his tormented
soul.

408
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:15,651
Are you suggesting we...

409
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:17,352
Yes!

410
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:21,556
That we perform a séance tonight,
and we make contact with Mr Quinn.

411
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,925
But why would anyone do such a
thing?

412
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:27,061
Why? Why not?

413
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,163
Beats bridge at any rate.

414
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,933
Do you even know how to conduct
one?

415
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:37,104
No... not exactly. But from what I
read it's not as hard as one may think.

416
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,474
All we require is a medium.

417
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,907
A what now?

418
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,945
Someone who has the power to
communicate with the dead.

419
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:47,013
Very shrewd Elizabeth.

420
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,315
A medium will soon be joining
us,

421
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:51,084
one that has been personally
recommended to me.

422
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,586
Well, who is this medium?

423
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,987
She's supposed to be very good,
in fact

424
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:57,990
She put old Percy King in touch
with his deceased father

425
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:02,261
in order to get the combination
to his safe.

426
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,196
I assume it worked?

427
00:27:04,263 --> 00:27:07,133
Take a look at his new mansion

428
00:27:11,705 --> 00:27:14,006
If I'm not very much mistaken

429
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:17,309
That will be her now.

430
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:25,217
You're looking a little uneasy,
George.

431
00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:27,353
Another drink? Settle your
nerves?

432
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,621
Please

433
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,590
George Walker Junior, afraid?

434
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:35,226
Now that is a first.

435
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:37,596
I just think its dumb as dirt to
go messing with things

436
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:40,331
we don't know diddly-squat
about.

437
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,402
Well I think it's a ripping
idea.

438
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:49,207
Here's to the paranormal.

439
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:54,479
Ladies and Gentlemen...

440
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:58,683
Madame Bellrose!

441
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:02,019
Good evening!

442
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:03,420
Let me introduce you to -

443
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:06,791
Mr Turner, the tennis player

444
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:08,091
Ah, yes...

445
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:12,529
And you must be Mr Walker
Junior, the oil man

446
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:14,531
Yeah, but don't call me
Junior...

447
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:15,699
Ms Hall

448
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:17,601
And Ms Barton, I presume

449
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:19,236
Wrong way round

450
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:21,405
Ah well, can't get them all
right.

451
00:28:21,472 --> 00:28:23,607
How do you already know our
names?

452
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:27,678
Oh... a name is a name is a
name...

453
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:35,051
Curious...

454
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:36,219
What's curious?

455
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:39,722
Is everything alright Madame
Bellrose?

456
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,724
Oh yes, perfectly fine

457
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,759
Just... a feeling.

458
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:45,695
What kind of feeling?

459
00:28:45,761 --> 00:28:48,164
Oh, probably nothing

460
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:52,602
These old houses are full of
stories and lives

461
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:55,070
Would you like a drink Madame
Bellrose?

462
00:28:55,136 --> 00:28:58,273
Well, if you offered me a dry
martini...

463
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,742
I'd have a dry martini!

464
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:03,679
Of course.

465
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:19,261
So, Ms Bellrose, tell us

466
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:23,665
When did you realise you had
these... remarkable powers?

467
00:29:23,732 --> 00:29:28,703
Well, it was on my sixth birthday,
and I was playing hide and seek

468
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,238
with some other children in the
woods

469
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:34,475
And I'd just found a rather good
hiding place

470
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,777
in an old oak tree.

471
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:40,648
Little did I know that this
particular tree was home

472
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:45,118
to a surprisingly aggressive
magpie

473
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:48,355
Well, on his return he was very
displeased

474
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:52,560
to see a grubby six year-old
hiding in his tree.

475
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,428
And this beastly bird started
pecking me

476
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:56,830
and attacking me

477
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:59,265
and I misplaced my footing

478
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:02,335
and down I fell, crashing to the
ground.

479
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:05,405
The next thing I knew, I was in
bed

480
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,806
with a bandage round my head

481
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:09,542
sporting two missing teeth,

482
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:13,246
and the ability to speak to the
dead!

483
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:19,519
What a fascinating tale!

484
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:23,155
And does anybody else in your
family possess these abilities?

485
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,490
Second sight is not like curly
hair my dear

486
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,895
It's not hereditary.

487
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:32,731
Is there any chance... I mean
could it be dangerous

488
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,734
to meddle with these sorts of
powers?

489
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:40,172
I do not consider myself a
meddler!

490
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,240
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
offend.

491
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,477
Ah don't worry, don't apologise.

492
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,349
Oh, I congratulate you on your
dry martini!

493
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:53,785
Thank you.

494
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,187
Well like anything exciting,

495
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:58,456
there's always a degree of
danger.

496
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,725
But, no more so than...

497
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,460
slipping on ice,

498
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:05,763
or burning yourself with a
match.

499
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,467
So you've never had a bad
experience?

500
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:13,537
I've slipped, but never fallen.

501
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,576
There you are George. There's
nothing to fear.

502
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,712
Forgive me, Victor, but this is
an enormous stick-up,

503
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,146
ain't it?

504
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,750
You know you actually had me
going for a second there.

505
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,885
Pardon?

506
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,487
You can't really be buying this?

507
00:31:30,553 --> 00:31:32,656
This... what?

508
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:35,258
This... Hogwash!

509
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:39,329
Do you think you know the world
so well, Mr Walker?

510
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:40,664
Just 'cos a chicken's got wings

511
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,632
don't mean it can fly.

512
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:44,501
What on earth does that mean?

513
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:48,905
It means, I ain't taking part in
this sham any longer

514
00:31:48,972 --> 00:31:51,240
It's fine, Mr Walker

515
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:54,343
to be a little afraid.

516
00:31:55,577 --> 00:31:58,280
I ain't yella

517
00:31:58,347 --> 00:31:59,915
Oh do pipe down George,

518
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:03,385
you're ruining all our fun.

519
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:07,790
Well I'm game. If everyone else
is.

520
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:10,492
Great show! Christine?

521
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,294
Oh why not...

522
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:15,463
Elizabeth?

523
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:18,366
I can't say I'm not a little
nervous about the idea...

524
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:19,835
But what about your novel?

525
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:23,671
You're writing a ghost story.
Simply think of this as...

526
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:25,007
research.

527
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:28,476
Yes... and I thought the ghosts
weren't the ones to fear

528
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:31,913
Remember?

529
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:35,383
Come on, it's just a bit of fun.

530
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,420
Very well.

531
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:41,689
Splendiferous!

532
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:45,760
Well... just you then George.

533
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,333
Fine! Why the hell not?

534
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:58,305
I'm in the minority here
anyways.

535
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,440
Let's get this over and done
with.

536
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:02,309
Aha! What a riot!

537
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,845
Madame Bellrose, is there
anything else you need

538
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,580
which I haven't already laid
out?

539
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:12,586
No, Mr Hall, you've done very
well at following my instructions.

540
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:18,390
Now, if you wouldn't mind taking
your places

541
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:45,885
Now, place your hands on the
table, like so.

542
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:49,521
Make sure your fingers are
touching

543
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:50,755
Very good.

544
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,791
Now I ask you do not speak

545
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:55,460
or make any sudden movements,

546
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:59,764
and try to clear your mind of
any thoughts.

547
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,033
You want us to think of nothing?

548
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,035
Should be easy for you, Victor.

549
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:08,106
Yes, clear your mind, it makes
for a better connection.

550
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:10,708
Is it likely that we'll make
contact?

551
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:13,744
I can't promise anything...

552
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:17,381
but if we do, I ask you do not
break the circle.

553
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:19,550
Do you understand?

554
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:22,452
Yes

555
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,657
Right, we're ready.

556
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:33,063
Spirits, we bring you gifts from
life into death.

557
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:38,401
Commune with us! And move
amongst us.

558
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,172
Is that rotten bread?

559
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,607
Yes, my dear, it enhances the
flavour

560
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:47,077
Spirits have very weakened taste
buds.

561
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:49,846
Now don't interrupt again.

562
00:34:52,182 --> 00:34:57,086
Spirits, we bring you gifts from
life into death.

563
00:34:57,153 --> 00:35:01,423
Commune with us, and move
amongst us.

564
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:06,929
Maybe they've got food
poisoning...

565
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:09,431
Do you see us, beloved one?

566
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:15,004
Spirits, can you hear us?

567
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:25,914
Is there anyone here who wishes
to make contact

568
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:28,583
with someone from the other
side?

569
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,451
Yes

570
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:36,590
I wish to make contact with Mr
Ichabod Quinn.

571
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:41,129
Spirits of the past, move
amongst us

572
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:45,133
Mr Ichabod Quinn, be guided by
the light of this world

573
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,703
and visit upon us.

574
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:00,814
Is that you, Mr Quinn?

575
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,653
Can you see him?

576
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,956
I can't see anyone.

577
00:36:09,023 --> 00:36:13,160
Look closely, can't you see?

578
00:36:17,864 --> 00:36:20,934
I can see clearly...

579
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,671
A pale man, in a black suit

580
00:36:24,737 --> 00:36:28,274
headed towards us.

581
00:36:28,341 --> 00:36:32,544
He's coming this way.

582
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:37,116
Is that you, Mr Quinn?

583
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:38,817
This is all just -

584
00:36:38,884 --> 00:36:43,522
Don't break the circle!

585
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:47,592
Come! Come again!

586
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:54,566
Come forward...

587
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:57,069
Oh!

588
00:36:58,636 --> 00:37:02,807
But your eyes!

589
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:06,811
What's happened to your eyes!?

590
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:10,815
No!! No no no!! Go back!

591
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:14,885
Go back!!

592
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,668
Madame Bellrose?

593
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,638
What on earth is going on?

594
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:39,142
Is she alright?

595
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:45,882
This house... will become your
tomb.

596
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:50,653
Your flesh will be torn, your
bones crushed to dust

597
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,293
and your souls extracted to a
painful and terrifying eternity

598
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,095
What the hell is she talking
about?

599
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:01,064
When the dawn breaks

600
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:04,666
The twelve kings and twelve
dukes of Hell will be released

601
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:08,670
upon this earth.

602
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:12,341
Flames will engulf you

603
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:16,145
and the great beast will rip you
limb from limb

604
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:20,049
for all of time.

605
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:23,751
They will sit upon the throne of
blood...

606
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:29,124
in an Eden of pain!

607
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,576
Careful!

608
00:38:57,151 --> 00:39:01,222
HERE COMES HELL!!

609
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:03,590
My god!!

610
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,864
Well I think another drink is in
order?

611
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,221
She's still kicking.

612
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:37,756
What happened to her?

613
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:40,025
She must be having some kind of
seizure...

614
00:39:40,092 --> 00:39:42,228
or attack of the brain.

615
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:45,231
She seemed to get stronger!?

616
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:47,867
Is that even possible?

617
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:50,702
Strong as a bull!

618
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:53,938
So what do we do with her now?

619
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:56,108
We should call for a doctor.

620
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:58,910
This house has no line.

621
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:02,981
We should drive to the village
then.

622
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:10,221
I think she's trying to say say
something.

623
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:37,915
My god!!!

624
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,792
Freddie!!

625
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:53,963
Quick! Put pressure on the
wound!

626
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:57,800
George you just shot my guest!

627
00:40:57,867 --> 00:40:59,702
Whiskey!

628
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:04,874
Deep breath, deep breath

629
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:06,375
calm down.

630
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:07,510
Drink that.

631
00:41:07,577 --> 00:41:08,945
You're going to be fine

632
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,113
My serving arm!!

633
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,885
Do you always bring a gun to a
dinner party!!??

634
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:31,933
I think it might be time we made
ourselves scarce.

635
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:44,379
It won't budge!

636
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:47,982
Stand back!!

637
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:51,219
Is there another way out?

638
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:55,457
Yes, the rear door. This way!

639
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:00,127
It can't be!

640
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:06,000
I told you not to mess with this
paranormal shit!

641
00:42:08,535 --> 00:42:13,307
She can't see us... move back,
quietly

642
00:42:26,953 --> 00:42:30,356
Sorry!

643
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:51,411
Don't mess with Texas.

644
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:55,581
How much ammunition did you
bring?!

645
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:00,652
Flee!!!!

646
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,321
Freddie!!

647
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:11,163
Drink! I need a drink.

648
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:15,567
Just something to... take the
edge off.

649
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,180
Christ!!

650
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,367
Who's there?

651
00:43:55,538 --> 00:43:59,042
Please!

652
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:00,577
Come on....

653
00:44:16,726 --> 00:44:19,629
Father?

654
00:44:20,663 --> 00:44:23,098
Father, is that really you?

655
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:27,669
You have disappointed me, my
son.

656
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:34,443
All my fortune I have worked so
hard for my entire life

657
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:38,647
You are throwing my life's work
to the wind.

658
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:45,987
On boat trips, and pony girls,
and holidays to India!

659
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:48,990
And vintage champagne.

660
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:52,460
What has become of your
potential?

661
00:44:52,527 --> 00:44:55,730
Father I'm sorry! I'm sorry...

662
00:44:55,797 --> 00:44:59,033
Ha ha ha!

663
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,337
You cannot escape!!

664
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,071
You will burn!!!

665
00:45:05,138 --> 00:45:08,208
Father, no!!!

666
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:28,728
What kind of bloody house is
this!?

667
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,064
Let me see your hand!

668
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:33,700
It's nothing, stop fussing!

669
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:36,235
Let me!

670
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:39,238
We need to cut it off.

671
00:45:39,305 --> 00:45:43,509
Don't be stupid. It's just a
little infected.

672
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:48,314
Dear God!!

673
00:45:54,553 --> 00:45:56,522
Freddie!!

674
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,818
What... what's happening to me?

675
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,554
What's happening to me?

676
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,656
No, I'm shrinking! Victor I'm
shrinking!

677
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,824
Victor, help me! I'm shrinking!

678
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,293
Freddie!! George?? I'm
shrinking!!

679
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:12,562
Why am I shrinking? Help!

680
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:14,530
Help me! Why aren't you
helping!?

681
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:20,269
Victor!!

682
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:25,140
Why can't you hear me!? Victor!?
Freddie??

683
00:47:25,206 --> 00:47:27,710
Come on George, I know you can
hear me!

684
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,880
Can't you hear me, George!?

685
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:34,182
Please, please help! I'm down
here!!

686
00:47:34,249 --> 00:47:35,250
Can't you hear me!!??

687
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:36,518
Please!!

688
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:38,821
George I know you can hear me!
Any of you...

689
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:39,755
Please!

690
00:47:45,794 --> 00:47:47,162
Elizabeth!! Please!

691
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:48,863
Please will you help me?!

692
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:51,333
Christine??

693
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,668
What are you doing down there?

694
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:56,236
Elizabeth please will you help??

695
00:47:56,303 --> 00:48:00,307
Elizabeth? Elizabeth... no!!

696
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:07,381
Look everyone, I found
Christine!

697
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:09,516
Gosh, she's so small!

698
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:10,952
I didn't even notice she'd gone.

699
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:12,486
What's she saying?

700
00:48:12,553 --> 00:48:14,755
I'm still here!

701
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:16,757
So insignificant!

702
00:48:16,824 --> 00:48:17,858
Get rid of her!

703
00:48:17,925 --> 00:48:21,295
Yes... squash her!!

704
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:24,531
Don't squash me, please, I'm not
insignificant!

705
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,769
Squash her!!

706
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:05,604
George?

707
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:06,638
Christine?

708
00:49:06,705 --> 00:49:08,507
Thank god, you're safe.

709
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:10,575
I've started to see things.

710
00:49:10,642 --> 00:49:12,778
I'm so afraid... will you protect
me?

711
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:15,580
Of course I will, you know I
always will.

712
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:17,849
Oh George, you're so kind.

713
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,519
I was such a fool to ever give
you the ring back.

714
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:23,254
God I can be so cruel...

715
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,425
Every day this past year I've
regretted that decision.

716
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:30,695
I've always loved you.

717
00:49:31,328 --> 00:49:33,932
I...

718
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:37,702
Fuck me!!

719
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:49,747
Kiss me George!!!

720
00:49:51,882 --> 00:49:55,552
Don't you love me, George!??

721
00:50:09,532 --> 00:50:11,968
So much for compensating for
something.

722
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:26,908
This way.

723
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:37,951
Christine!

724
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:38,852
Victor!

725
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:39,686
You scared the life out of me!

726
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:40,153
God you gave me a fright!

727
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:40,620
Shut up!

728
00:51:40,687 --> 00:51:42,856
In here!

729
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:47,828
Quick, into the games room!

730
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,867
It seems to be all-

731
00:51:55,901 --> 00:51:57,636
George!

732
00:51:57,703 --> 00:52:00,706
Stay back!

733
00:52:00,773 --> 00:52:02,675
What the bloody hell do you
think you're doing?!

734
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:04,643
Stop talking and do as I say

735
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:08,379
Or I will gun you down like a
dog in the street.

736
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:11,016
Sit.

737
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:25,830
What's gotten into you?

738
00:52:25,897 --> 00:52:28,167
Ain't a question of what's
gotten into me.

739
00:52:28,234 --> 00:52:31,436
It's a question of what may have
gotten into you.

740
00:52:31,502 --> 00:52:35,073
These spirits, or whatever you
want to call them

741
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:37,175
Can take on the form of us.

742
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:39,978
We're not evil spirits, George,
we're human.

743
00:52:40,044 --> 00:52:41,579
Now whatever the hell this is,

744
00:52:41,646 --> 00:52:43,580
it's trying to play games with
us.

745
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,850
It wants to beat us.

746
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:48,752
You have to believe me.

747
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:52,589
Maybe you're telling the truth.

748
00:52:52,656 --> 00:52:54,424
Maybe you aint.

749
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:58,896
Until I am one hundred percent sure
that you are who you say you are...

750
00:52:58,962 --> 00:53:01,999
I'm gonna keep my gun trained on
you.

751
00:53:02,065 --> 00:53:05,636
Is that crystal clear?

752
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:14,912
Now, where's Freddie?

753
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:19,482
Dead.

754
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:23,019
What?

755
00:53:23,086 --> 00:53:25,488
He's dead.

756
00:53:25,554 --> 00:53:29,158
How?

757
00:53:29,225 --> 00:53:31,961
I killed him.

758
00:53:32,028 --> 00:53:34,096
Why? Why!?

759
00:53:34,163 --> 00:53:36,699
Hold up there.

760
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:44,839
Now I've got the gun.

761
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:46,875
So let's just calm down -

762
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:14,802
George!

763
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:19,673
Look at me! Look at me...

764
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,576
Everything's going to be
alright!

765
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:24,211
Oh god!!

766
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:27,014
Everything's going to be fine...
everything's going to be just fine

767
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:31,218
George!!

768
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,956
It's gonna be fine... just
fine...

769
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:40,160
George? George?

770
00:54:47,267 --> 00:54:51,271
George?

771
00:54:56,709 --> 00:55:00,613
Oh George, you poor fool...

772
00:55:05,284 --> 00:55:10,223
What have you done, Vicky?

773
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:16,061
I'm sorry... it was just a
mistake

774
00:55:16,128 --> 00:55:17,863
It just went off...

775
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:22,234
Oh god... why is this happening?

776
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,636
We haven't done anything we just-

777
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:29,941
Performed a séance. We wanted to
make contact with Ichabod Quinn

778
00:55:30,008 --> 00:55:32,010
and we did.

779
00:55:32,077 --> 00:55:37,882
And now he's back and he wants
to finish his life's work.

780
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:41,952
We've opened Hell.

781
00:55:45,357 --> 00:55:49,394
George was right.

782
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:53,564
We shouldn't have meddled with
this.

783
00:55:55,866 --> 00:56:00,171
This is all your fault! You made
us do that bloody séance...

784
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:02,840
Don't blame me!

785
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:05,109
All of this was just meant to be
a bit of fun!

786
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:08,312
You've damned us all you fucking
idiot!!

787
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:11,848
Try and calm down you're being
hysterical!

788
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:15,051
That's enough!

789
00:56:15,118 --> 00:56:17,720
There's no use in pointing
fingers now.

790
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:20,757
We're all in the same boat. If
we want to get out of here alive

791
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:24,260
we're going to have to start
working together.

792
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,029
What can we do?

793
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:28,331
Remember what Madame Bellrose
said?

794
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:32,168
At dawn, the moon will consume
the sun.

795
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:36,239
We need to end this now, or God
knows what will happen.

796
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:38,208
But how?

797
00:56:38,274 --> 00:56:43,379
We need to find the gateway to
Hell and close it for good.

798
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:48,283
The basement. That's where Ichabod
would conduct his ceremonies

799
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,753
to contact the other side, at
the lowest point of the house.

800
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:56,024
That's where we saw that thing,
Madame Bellrose, heading.

801
00:56:59,161 --> 00:57:03,165
The party's over.

802
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:41,268
Whiskey?

803
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:44,838
She doesn't drink, remember?

804
00:57:44,905 --> 00:57:47,207
Chin chin.

805
00:57:58,451 --> 00:58:01,221
Coast is clear.

806
00:58:07,494 --> 00:58:11,230
It's faster if we cut through
here.

807
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:13,132
Where do we go now?

808
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,435
Through this door, then turn
right.

809
00:58:27,446 --> 00:58:31,049
Much too slow, Christine!

810
00:59:04,147 --> 00:59:05,148
Damn!

811
00:59:05,215 --> 00:59:06,484
Let me see!

812
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,919
No, don't bother. I'm done for!

813
00:59:08,986 --> 00:59:10,487
No, no you're not!

814
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:14,124
I don't want to turn into one of
them!

815
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:15,959
Don't let me!

816
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:17,928
No, no you can't! Please!

817
00:59:17,995 --> 00:59:22,965
It's the only way! Don't worry
about me,

818
00:59:23,033 --> 00:59:26,169
darling sister.

819
00:59:29,406 --> 00:59:33,809
Sorry again for spilling wine on
your dress...

820
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:45,888
Let's get this over with.

821
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:56,465
No, I'll do it.

822
01:00:05,974 --> 01:00:11,246
Some party, hey?

823
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:15,317
A real one to remember.

824
01:00:30,532 --> 01:00:32,966
Come on.

825
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:35,903
We have to go now.

826
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:45,346
There's the staircase to the
basement.

827
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:50,284
I can't! I can't take it any
more.

828
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:53,654
First George, and now... and now
poor Victor.

829
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:56,989
Look at me! You need to stay
strong, I need your help

830
01:00:57,056 --> 01:00:59,058
I can't do this on my own!

831
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:01,394
I can't... I can't take it.

832
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:03,396
Yes you can! And you have to!

833
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:06,466
It's the only way! When we end
this,

834
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:08,534
maybe they'll all come back, all
of them.

835
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:10,403
Will they?

836
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:14,140
I won't stop until I see the
real Freddie again.

837
01:01:14,207 --> 01:01:16,409
Don't you want to see your
brother again?

838
01:01:16,476 --> 01:01:17,943
And George...

839
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:20,011
But how do you know?

840
01:01:20,078 --> 01:01:24,883
I don't. But there's only one
way to find out.

841
01:01:26,385 --> 01:01:29,221
Let's end this, once and for
all.

842
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:33,291
You and me.

843
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:40,089
Victor... kills!

844
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:36,677
What is it?

845
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:40,548
It's George!

846
01:03:41,415 --> 01:03:43,216
Wait!

847
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:47,287
It might not really be him.

848
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:01,034
I have to be sure.

849
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:07,774
Christine!

850
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:32,364
Christine! Come back!

851
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:34,400
Christine!

852
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,623
George?

853
01:05:28,018 --> 01:05:32,221
Is it really you?

854
01:05:34,524 --> 01:05:37,393
Please?

855
01:06:37,584 --> 01:06:40,487
Bye Vicky.

856
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:48,529
Thank you.

857
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:50,798
Don't mention it.

858
01:06:54,368 --> 01:06:57,571
We must be getting closer.

859
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:21,327
And the dragon sat on the rock
and the rock was the moon

860
01:07:21,394 --> 01:07:25,665
and the moon consumed the sun and
out of the night came the blackness

861
01:07:25,732 --> 01:07:29,367
and from the blackness came the
dawn...

862
01:07:29,434 --> 01:07:30,603
Now what?

863
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:34,807
Let's kill the bitch.

864
01:07:36,743 --> 01:07:40,312
...comes fear, and fear spawns
power...

865
01:07:40,378 --> 01:07:44,050
Clever little girls to get so far,
but I'm afraid it will be of no use.

866
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:45,450
The gate is opened!

867
01:07:45,517 --> 01:07:50,555
And it will remain open until
all Hell is set free.

868
01:07:50,622 --> 01:07:52,724
Shoot it Elizabeth!

869
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:55,093
Christine!

870
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,997
My darling. I'm so glad you came
to me my love.

871
01:07:59,064 --> 01:08:00,866
I knew you would.

872
01:08:00,932 --> 01:08:03,567
I'm ready to be together
properly now.

873
01:08:03,634 --> 01:08:05,703
No more fooling around.

874
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,539
No more toying with other
lovers.

875
01:08:08,606 --> 01:08:11,009
Now we can be together for an
eternity.

876
01:08:11,076 --> 01:08:14,745
We'll never be apart again.

877
01:08:14,812 --> 01:08:18,549
You're the love of my life,
Christine.

878
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:21,719
Don't listen to him, Elizabeth!

879
01:08:21,786 --> 01:08:23,687
Is it true?

880
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:33,429
Oh, Elizabeth. Did you really think
I marry someone as small as you?

881
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:37,034
How pathetic of you to even say
yes when I asked.

882
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:40,703
We were only together for a few
mere months.

883
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:44,574
Were you really that desperate?

884
01:08:44,641 --> 01:08:50,379
I was only with you to make
Christine mad with jealousy.

885
01:08:50,446 --> 01:08:54,449
And it worked.

886
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,822
Is it true?

887
01:08:58,888 --> 01:09:00,089
Elizabeth you have to listen to
me -

888
01:09:00,156 --> 01:09:05,694
Just answer the question.

889
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:08,831
Yes.

890
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:13,535
So is that why you were so awful
to me?

891
01:09:13,602 --> 01:09:15,037
I was a fool to behave the way I
did

892
01:09:15,103 --> 01:09:18,140
you have to believe me, I was
just in love with the wrong man!

893
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,176
Yes... poor George.

894
01:09:21,243 --> 01:09:25,513
He's down there now, burning for
eternity.

895
01:09:27,216 --> 01:09:28,716
I'm bored of this now.

896
01:09:28,784 --> 01:09:29,952
Christine, my love.

897
01:09:30,018 --> 01:09:32,087
Let's be together forever!

898
01:09:32,154 --> 01:09:35,623
Elizabeth!! Elizabeth please!!

899
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:38,826
She's far too feeble to do
anything.

900
01:09:38,893 --> 01:09:40,761
I'm so sorry Elizabeth!

901
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:43,798
Elizabeth, please!!

902
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,918
You fucking bitches!!!

903
01:10:17,864 --> 01:10:19,866
Help!! No!!

904
01:10:19,933 --> 01:10:21,600
Christine!!

905
01:10:21,668 --> 01:10:24,436
Elizabeth!!

906
01:10:27,007 --> 01:10:27,740
Elizabeth!!

907
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:31,144
Hold on!!

908
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:49,560
No!!

909
01:13:17,516 --> 01:13:22,516
