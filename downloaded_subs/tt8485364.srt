00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,467
Welcome to Road FM,

3
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,588
This is your host...

4
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,267
Oh. No, now it's not
the best time.

5
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,827
Can I call you back later?

6
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,588
Yes, it's in the middle
of nowhere, yeah.

7
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,068
Mum, it's always
the same question.

8
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,788
I already told you
where it was.

9
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,427
It's upstate New York
near Springwell.

10
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,148
No...

11
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,788
no, no, it's not in ruins,
no, it just

12
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,828
needs a little fixing up.

13
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,388
Give her a big kiss.

14
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,468
Listen, we still have a lot
of unpacking to do.

15
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,228
I'll call you back later,
I promise, okay?

16
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,947
Bye, mum.

17
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,508
Paca paca, mum, paca.

18
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,548
So, when is the Queen Mom
paying us a visit?

19
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,508
Oh, don't hold
your breath!

20
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,468
Hey, June bug!

21
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,068
- Mmm.
- Come here, come here.

22
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,948
It's gonna be fine.

23
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,269
- Mm-hmm.
- I promise.

24
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,868
Look.

25
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,427
- Home...
- Yeah.

26
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:22,150
Sweet home.

27
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,188
Kate!

28
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,868
- Okay, I'm back.
- Okay. Okay.

29
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,708
Kate?

30
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,828
- Aah!
- Oh! Fuck!

31
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,108
Oh, shit. Are you crazy?
Come here.

32
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,787
You... You giving
me a heart attack.

33
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,508
What are you doing?
I said I'll handle this.

34
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,987
Like next month
or something?

35
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:49,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's
that supposed to mean?

36
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,028
You're gonna start drawing
and nothing else will matter.

37
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,748
Hey...

38
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,827
What?

39
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,067
- I wasn't nagging you.
- Oh, come on.

40
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,428
Are you serious?

41
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,347
Why did I have to fall
in love with an artist?

42
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,708
Well,

43
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,188
you can't say your mom
didn't warn you.

44
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,630
Hmm...

45
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,430
Hey.

46
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,747
Hey!

47
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:17,547
It's faster than the stairs.
Sorry.

48
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,110
Kate!

49
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,669
What's going on?

50
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,588
Shit.

51
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,990
I'm calling
the power company.

52
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,028
We did it.

53
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,107
You'll become a great painter,
and I'll be

54
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:54,267
the perfect housewife...

55
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,068
slowly turning into
a fat cow.

56
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,028
- I will love you fat.
- Yeah, sure.

57
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,908
You know you should grow
a longer beard.

58
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,428
Genius painters
all have beards.

59
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,468
What?

60
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,748
God, you're such a wimp.

61
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,668
What? I'm not a wimp.

62
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,628
I know all about life
in the wilderness.

63
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,268
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

64
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,308
Like Belgium has anything
remotely wild about it.

65
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,227
Hey, we make close to
a thousand different beers,

66
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,588
I say that's pretty wild.

67
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,867
Oh, my God, what have you
dragged me into?

68
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:41,948
I'm stuck here
with a city boy!

69
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,668
Yeah?

70
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,028
Come here, you farm girl.

71
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,908
Ah.
I'll show you a farm girl.

72
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,987
You'll show me a farm girl?
Show me a farm girl.

73
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,547
All you need to do
is take that first step.

74
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:06,188
Yeah, I know.

75
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,508
Do it.

76
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,428
- Honey?
- Hmm?

77
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,947
- Do we have plans of the house?
- Yeah, I think so.

78
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,828
- Hello, Andre.
- Hey, Katrina,

79
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,907
I'm going to cut to the chase.
You're my best translator,

80
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:26,307
and I need this for...
yesterday.

81
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,068
Flattery
will get you everywhere.

82
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,628
- I know I'm asking a lot.
- Yeah, and paying very little.

83
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,788
Two weeks?

84
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,908
Just... I can't do that
in two weeks.

85
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,588
I need more time...
and money.

86
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,148
I will do it.

87
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,507
Matt?

88
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:57,108
The guy from the power company
is here.

89
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,908
Jesus.

90
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,268
Here it is.

91
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,107
Holy Mary,
Mother of God.

92
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:16,388
I know.

93
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,588
What?

94
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,107
This thing is older
than my grandma.

95
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:24,987
- Is it causing the surges?
- Could be.

96
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:27,788
Can you do
anything about it?

97
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,787
I have never seen
anything like it.

98
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,868
I'm guessing you're not
from these parts.

99
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,668
No, we just moved down
from New York.

100
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,187
- And before that?
- Oh, uh, Europe.

101
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,107
You know, I was real surprised
when they told me

102
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,588
someone had finally bought
this place.

103
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,110
Then again
it was a long time ago.

104
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,987
What was a long time ago?

105
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,748
The previous owners...

106
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,468
they got killed in this house.

107
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,308
You know...

108
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,068
Shit! Nobody told you?

109
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,948
Listen, if I was you,
I wouldn't touch it

110
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,108
but I'll get you
an estimate when I can.

111
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,629
Well, good luck.

112
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,268
"House of Blood."

113
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,268
"Brutal slaying of two
in Carroll County.

114
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,268
Two people were found dead
in their home yesterday morning

115
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,347
near Durham, police said
in a statement.

116
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:52,628
The couple identified as Paul

"The identity of the suspect
remains unknown.

119
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,949
God, I need another bottle.

120

Matt?

121
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:22,748
Where did you get
all this stuff?

122
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,988
Honey, a real van Gogh.
1889.

123
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,508
Yeah, sure.

124
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,068
Hey.

"Apples."

126
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,947
Matt?
Are you high or something?

127
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:40,028
Maybe.

128
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,708
Honey, what do you need
most in the world?

129
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,628
There's nothing I need.

130
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,708
- A better job.
- No, no, no, name a thing.

131
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,627
Come on! There's got to be
something. Anything.

132
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:53,667
Please. Do it for me.

133
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:55,589
I want a thousand dollars.

134
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,830
Why didn't
I think of that?

135
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:04,990
Okay, okay, okay.

136
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,188
Is this fake?

137
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,829
Does it look fake?

138
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:33,108
Where did you find this?

139
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,108
Here.

140
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,747
How did it get here?

141
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:40,388
Like everything else.
It just... got here!

142
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,788
Fine. Let's see how far
you can take this.

143
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,308
What if I ask for more?

144
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,428
- Do it.
- 10,000?

145
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,508
- Make it 100,000.
- Sure, why not a million?

146
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,548
Ask for it.

147
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,267
All right...

148
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:59,388
I want a million dollars.

149
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,828
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

150
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,028
- This is fucking scary, Matt!
- Yes, it is!

151
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,109
But I think
we should enjoy it.

152
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,908
I've got a bad feeling.

153
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,347
June bug, come on,

154
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,388
let's just...

155
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,070
have fun.

156
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,108
Hey.

157
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,667
Come on.

158
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:41,067
Let's have some fun.

159
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,308
I want the best champagne
in the world.

160
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,588
Tons of champagne.
Ah!

161
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,307
Isn't it fucking great?

162
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,427
I want more money
and more money!

163
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,788
I want money!

164
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,947
I want to be a princess!

165
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,627
I just aborted my brilliant
career as a translator.

166
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,348
That's my girl.

167
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,828
Mm.

168
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:48,147
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

169
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,507
Oh, is that caviar?

170
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,107
Beluga, my dear.
The best of caviars.

171
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,787
You're so greedy, grrrr!

172
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:10,628
How does it... work?

173
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,750
What do you want me to say?
It's like, I don't know...

174
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:17,468
...a computer.

175
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,308
Who cares how it works,
you just...

176
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,148
use it.

177
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:32,988
Yeah, but computers
can get bugs.

178
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,107
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

179
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,908
Come on! Whoo!

180
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,627
Whoo!

181
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,468
- Whoo!
- Aah!

182
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,428
Kate?

183
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,908
Hey.

184
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,067
Hey.

185
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:59,108
Where is the necklace
you asked for?

186
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,868
I don't know.

187
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,107
Anyway it was just
a figment.

188
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:08,108
I can always get another.

189
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:12,710
And another.

190
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,870
And... another.

191
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,067
And... another!

192
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,628
- Don't open them.
- What?

193
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,987
- No peeking.
- This is so mysterious.

194
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,950
Shh, come on.
Come on.

195
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,190
Open them.

196
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,230
Let's give it
another try.

197
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,787
Honey, remember
what the doctors said.

198
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:04,988
There's nothing wrong
with you.

199
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,908
There's nothing wrong
with me.

200
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,948
There's no reason
we can't have children.

201
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,108
The doctors...

202
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,388
have no idea what
they're talking about.

203
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,590
We already tried twice.

204
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,588
Both babies died.

205
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,307
In here, remember.

206
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:33,027
It happens
to millions of couples.

207
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:34,947
It happened to us.

208
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:36,190
To me.

209
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,229
I can't do this again.

210
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,428
Kate?

211
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,230
Kate?

212
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,949
I'm going for a ride.

213
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:24,468
Kate?

214
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,187
Hello.

215
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,347
Kate?

216
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:56,508
Whose baby is this?

217
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,630
Shh.

218
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,749
It's a boy.

219
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:12,430
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

220
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,348
- What? You wanted it.
- Not like this.

221
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,827
- There was no other way.
- Yes, there was.

222
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:25,068
- Not for us.
- We could have tried again.

223
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,508
- What? And failed again?
- You don't know that.

224
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,867
- I took a shortcut.
- A shortcut?

225
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:32,667
- Are you out of your f...
- Shh!

226
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,748
Are you out of your
fucking mind?!

227
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,268
You used the room
to make a baby.

228
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,028
Yes! Yes, I did.

229
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,668
Well, now,
do what you need to do.

230
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,748
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.

231
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,749
We're not keeping it.

232
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,228
You can't be serious.

233
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,948
Kate, you're not...

234
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,428
Kate?

235
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,070
Kate, this is wrong.

236
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,307
Come on.

237
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,387
Say the words.

238
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,348
I don't know what to say.

239
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,828
Say anything.

240
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,348
Say...

241
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,148
you want it...

242
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,747
You want it gone.

243
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,708
It's all right.
I'll do it.

244
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,868
I'll do it.

245
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,987
Come on, do something!

246
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:09,348
What do you want me to do?
It's the middle of the night.

247
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,187
So go to the room!

248
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:18,867
I want a baby's bottle,
with milk.

249
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,748
Yeah.

250
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,070
Thank you.

251
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:33,230
He wouldn't wait.

252
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,668
How did you...

253
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,910
I don't know.
It just works.

254
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,467
Oh, yeah.

255
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,908
Aren't you a pretty boy?

256
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,508
Yeah.

257
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,508
Huh?

258
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,188
What was that?

259
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,947
- Yes?
- Hi, uh...

260
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:07,347
What patient
do you wish to see?

261
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:09,070
Uh, John Doe.

262
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,628
You want to see John Doe?

263
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,468
The John Doe?

264
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,108
How many do you have?

265
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,428
Just the one.

266
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,228
So? What's the problem?

267
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,588
When you want to see someone
at a psychiatric ward,

268
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,268
you have to be on that person's
approved visiting list.

269
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,948
John Doe has no list.

270
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,027
You mean he hasn't received
a single visit?

271
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:33,228
- In 45 years?
- Reporters.

272
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,307
Are you a reporter?

273
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,067
Sure.

274
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,310
You're no reporter.

275
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:32,588
My name is Matt Dewitt.

276
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,709
I live in
Springwell House.

277
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,788
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

278
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,428
For you.

279
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,308
So, how do you like it?

280
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,147
What do you know about it?

281
00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:59,150
Are you having fun?

282
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,748
Come on.

283
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,187
Nice clothes.

284
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:10,548
Great food.

285
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,910
Maybe some jewelry,
some cash?

286
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,830
Pussy maybe?

287
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:23,427
What do you want from me?

288
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,547
Why did you kill
the Shaeffers?

289
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:29,067
It was the only way.

290
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,268
I need answers.

291
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,588
What you need is advice.

292
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,547
Forget about the room.

293
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:40,908
Get out of the house
and do that now,

294
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,948
before it's too late.

295
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,227
No, but you won't,
will you?

296
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:51,708
I can see it,
I know your kind.

297
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,627
- My kind?
- Yeah, creatures of need.

298
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:59,388
You crave and you crave
and you crave, and then...

299
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,268
you die.

300
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,547
- And you're different?
- Oh, yeah.

301
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:07,750
In more ways
than you can imagine.

302
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:10,988
Hey.

303
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,187
Come here,
let me tell you something.

304
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,908
The only thing more dangerous
than a person

305
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,868
that can't get
what they want...

306
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,228
is a person that gets
whatever they want.

307
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,790
40 bucks, please.

308
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,307
Yes, you are
a little bug.

309
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,908
Shh shh shh,
it's okay, it's okay.

310
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,227
Yeah, let's go see...

311
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:31,028
Let's go see
what's going on.

312
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,908
Stop it! Stop it!
Is this gonna hurt the baby?

313
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,068
I'm trying to figure out
how it works.

314
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,148
Now we suddenly
need to know?

315
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,988
I do.

316
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,188
Where are you going?

317
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,067
- For a breath of air.
- No!

318
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:10,068
It's not safe.

319
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,668
- What are you talking about?
- Kate...

320
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,747
trust me.

321
00:39:15,749 --> 00:39:17,547
I have my reasons.

322
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:19,908
What reasons?

323
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,748
Matt, what reasons?

324
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,307
Look at you.

325
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:56,108
Matt!

326
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,708
Matt! Matt!

327
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:09,867
Matt! Matt!

328
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,948
Matt!

329
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:41,388
You know what's going on,
don't you?

330
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,030
Not for sure.

331
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,787
Well, you know something.

332
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:54,867
There's this man...

333
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:57,670
- he knows about the room.
- Who?

334
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,187
- A Mr. John Doe.
- Come on, that's not funny!

335
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:05,868
- Oh, forget it.
- Matt! Please.

336
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,748
Kate, the point is...

337
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,868
the room makes things, okay?

338
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,707
That's what it does.
It's like...

339
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,668
a giant 3D printer.

340
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,348
It makes stuff.

341
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,107
And on one condition,

342
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:24,987
which is that you never
take that stuff outdoors.

343
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:28,388
- And if you do...
- What? It ages?

344
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:32,268
And it turns to dust.

345
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,908
But...

346
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,188
a baby is not a thing.

347
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,708
Yes, it is.

348
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,668
It's a thing made of...

349
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,228
flesh and bone.

350
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,908
And a soul.

351
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,427
Hi.

352
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,587
It's all right.

353
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,627
It's all right.

354
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,827
Come on.
Come on, concentrate.

355
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:05,828
Tom and Katy...

356
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,228
Tom and Katy go camping.

357
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,307
- Good.
- What's camping?

358
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:14,588
It's when you live in a tent.
When you're on vacation.

359
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,468
- Can I go camping?
- No, you can't.

360
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,988
For the same reason you can't
answer the door.

361
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,308
You're sick, my love.

362
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,148
I don't feel sick,
not germ sick.

363
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,988
Well, that's because
you're in this house.

364
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,908
It protects you.

365
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,668
But if you go outside,
the germs will get you.

366
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,308
There are no germs
in this house?

367
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,548
Only good germs.

368
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,627
- I want to go camping.
- We'll see.

369
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:44,187
Now...

370
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:46,587
"Oh, my" says Katy.

371
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:50,187
"I forgot my bathing..."

372
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:52,707
Cat.

373
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:54,308
There's no such thing
as a bathing cat.

374
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,868
Yes, there is.

375
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,987
Take a cat, throw it in the tub,
that's a bathing cat.

376
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,627
Okay, Shane.
I'm not in the mood.

377
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,427
It's a P,
so it's "bathing..."

378
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:07,347
Cat.

379
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:08,748
It's "cap"!

380
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,028
"Bathing cap." Say it.

381
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,388
- Bathing cat.
- Enough.

382
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,228
Cat, cat, cat!

383
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,427
- Stop that.
- Cat, cat, cat!

384
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:18,948
Stop it right now!

385
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,908
Cat!

386
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,507
Cat!

387
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:26,508
You go pick those up!

388
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,469
Right now, Shane!

389
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,827
Shane?

390
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:54,788
Breakfast's ready.

391
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,428
Eat.

392
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,947
Come on, eat your eggs.

393
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,107
Shane, you come back here
and finish your breakfast.

394
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,590
Now.

395
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,069
- Morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning.

396
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:38,148
Thank you.

397
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,708
Here you go,
have a nice day.

398
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,270
Matt, delivery.

399
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,947
Shane!

400
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:57,788
What's got into you?

401
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,427
- What's got into you?!
- What happened?

402
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,190
Okay, it's okay.
Come.

403
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,910
It's all right.

404
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:23,228
Kate!

405
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,107
Hey!

406
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:28,068
- I'm not doing this.
- You don't like it?

407
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,828
Feel free to leave.
Anytime you want!

408
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,507
Stop it, please.

409
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,788
You'll hurt your teeth.

410
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,027
I love you.

411
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:23,588
Do you love me?

412
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,108
Of course I do.

413
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,390
Can I sleep with you?

414
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,348
I want to be
with you forever.

415
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,788
Do you want to be with me
forever, too?

416
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:50,028
Of course I do.

417
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,788
Of course.

418
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:56,388
Come here, come here.

419
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,510
Ah!

420
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,349
What are you doing
in here?

421
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,188
What happened?

422
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,988
How long are you going
to be doing this, huh?

423
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,628
This ridiculous
hermit routine.

424
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,468
I told you he cannot come
in here, this is myroom.

425
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,508
Why do you have to do this?
He's just a baby.

426
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,908
No, he's not,
he's a figment.

427
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,828
For fuck's sake, I'm not having
this conversation again.

428
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:21,828
- Kate? Kate?
- What?

429
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:24,068
- Did you do this?
- What time is it?

430
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,710
- Did you?
- No.

431
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:50,390
Wow!

432
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,870
Shane? Did you do this?

433
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:22,550
This is amazing.

434
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,188
Ah!

435
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:43,068
Matt!
What's the matter with you?

436
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,787
Stop it!

437
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:48,387
You do not go in there,
do you understand?

438
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:50,028
Leave him alone.

439
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,347
I'm sorry, mommy.

440
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:58,467
But you do it all the time
and it's not really outside.

441
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:01,068
There are no germs in the Room.

442
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:39,027
You can't stop us from going
into the room.

443
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:41,028
Huh, watch me.

444
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,427
Matt, he was only playing.
He didn't hurt anyone.

445
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:47,667
What does it mean, Matt?
That Shane is clever?

446
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:49,668
That he's smarter
than we are?

447
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:53,187
It means he can dream up...
I don't know...

448
00:55:53,189 --> 00:55:54,747
a dragon.

449
00:55:54,749 --> 00:55:57,468
And a dragon will magically
surface in our home.

450
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,588
A host of dragons.

451
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,628
- Are you afraid of him?
- Of course I am.

452
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,627
And you should be, too.

453
00:56:03,629 --> 00:56:05,468
But he is only a child.

454
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,587
So he can't control his
emotions.

455
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:10,347
He can get mad at you because
you wouldn't let him watch TV.

456
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:13,947
He can want to hurt you.
Or me.

457
00:56:13,949 --> 00:56:15,747
Or both of us.

458
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:18,108
I'm not giving him
that option.

459
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,707
- And you shouldn't...
- Shh!

460
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,908
Hello?

461
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:24,747
Hello, boy.

462
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:26,830
Yes?

463
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,948
Who is this?

464
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,148
You know you're not allowed
to answer the phone.

465
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,987
How did you
get this number?

466
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:38,468
Who was it?

467
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,948
He said his name was...

468
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,069
John Doe.

469
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,107
You don't call here,
you understand?

470
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:52,467
So you made a child, Matt?
Nice boy.

471
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:55,707
Did you ask for it?

472
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:57,548
Who asked for it, Matt?

473
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:59,110
My wife.

474
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,427
What's your connection
with the Room?

475
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:19,148
My mother showed it
to me... next question.

476
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,988
Is there a way...

477
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:23,067
to stop the aging process?

478
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:25,508
You mean a way to bring
something outside of the house

479
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,628
- so it doesn't turn to dust?
- Yes!

480
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,268
Yeah, there's a way, Matt, but I
don't think you want to know.

481
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,907
I have to know.

482
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:35,388
You know the rule, Matt.
Nothing created inside the room

483
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,548
can survive
outside the house.

484
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,147
You know that, right?

485
00:57:39,149 --> 00:57:41,907
Wrong!

486
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:45,147
Answer this, what did it take
for man to be free?

487
00:57:45,149 --> 00:57:46,707
I'm not in the mood
for riddles.

488
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:48,788
What did it take?

489
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,188
I-I... I don't know.

490
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,948
God had to die, of course.

491
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,307
Didn't you read Nietzsche?

492
00:57:56,309 --> 00:58:01,028
Man wants to be free.
But first, the creator must die.

493
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:03,027
That's just...

494
00:58:03,029 --> 00:58:05,307
the natural order
of things, you know?

495
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:07,388
Children outliving
their parents.

496
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,348
I don't understand.

497
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,547
No, I think
you do understand, Matt.

498
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:14,388
Think!

499
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,827
Matt,
if your wife dies...

500
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:19,788
then the child she created
inside the room

501
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,188
becomes part
of this world and...

502
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,188
he's free to live and...

503
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,667
and to love and...

504
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,388
age like anyone else.

505
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,347
He's free to be...

506
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:33,188
sent to
a mental institution

507
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,667
for the rest of his life.

508
00:58:35,669 --> 00:58:37,910
You're a figment, too.

509
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:44,148
That's why you killed them. The truth is

510
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:47,348
they wanted me to live.

511
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:50,268
So they knew
they had to die.

512
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,908
First,

513
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,790
mother killed father,
and then she forced me to...

514
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,628
That was...

515
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,868
That was hard enough.

516
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,668
But here's a question
for you, Matt.

517
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:10,068
What are you gonna do?

518
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:14,108
You gonna kill the child
to save your wife?

519
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,868
Or you gonna kill your wife
to save the child?

520
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,948
Kate?

521
00:59:55,709 --> 00:59:58,467
Oh, boy, this is fun.

522
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:01,868
Yeah, it's safer than shootin'
off fireworks.

523
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:17,028
Kate?
I'm officially worried.

524
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,868
Call me, okay?

525
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,668
Or better yet, come home.

526
01:00:56,189 --> 01:00:58,947
Hello, this is Kate,
leave me a message.

527
01:00:58,949 --> 01:01:01,308
Fuck!

528
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:07,430
Where's mummy?

529
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,667
I don't know.

530
01:02:11,669 --> 01:02:15,188
When's she coming back?

531
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,988
I don't know.

532
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,268
You don't know anything?

533
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,190
That's right.

534
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,830
What's a figment?

535
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,507
You told mommy I was a figment.
Is that bad?

536
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:32,868
No, it's...
No, it's... it's...

537
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,710
It's nothing. Forget I said it.
Come on, eat your food.

538
01:02:39,149 --> 01:02:41,948
You're not my dad!

539
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,028
At least we agree
on something.

540
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:47,588
Where is he?
Where is my real dad?

541
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,467
What did you do to him?

542
01:02:49,469 --> 01:02:52,587
Where is my real one?
Tell me where he is.

543
01:02:52,589 --> 01:02:54,468
Tell me where
my real dad is!

544
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,628
Listen, kid,

545
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:59,148
you don't have a dad.

546
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,308
You don't have a mother
either.

547
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,948
Kate...
is not your mother.

548
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:05,427
Yes, she is!

549
01:03:05,429 --> 01:03:07,308
No.

550
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,787
She's not.

551
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:12,147
And you're not a real kid.

552
01:03:12,149 --> 01:03:14,348
You want to know
what a figment is? Huh?

553
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:16,668
It's something
that's not real.

554
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:18,987
Like you.

555
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:22,068
Do you know why you're not
allowed to go outside?

556
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,868
Forget germs.

557
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:26,708
If you leave this place,
you'll grow

558
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:29,547
older and older
till you're nothing

559
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:32,667
but a tiny pile
of dust.

560
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:34,788
That's why.

561
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,948
You're lying!

562
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,068
You don't believe me?

563
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,228
Stop it!

564
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:44,787
Stop it!

565
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:46,268
No!

566
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,627
Go on!

567
01:03:48,629 --> 01:03:51,108
See what happens!

568
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,908
Go on!

569
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,308
Do you remember anything

570
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:58,028
before the past
three months?

571
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:01,947
Do you have any memory
outside of this house?

572
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:05,868
Did you ever
celebrate a birthday?

573
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,988
You're not a real person.

574
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,270
You're an idea!

575
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:48,389
Listen, Shane,
I'm sorry, okay?

576
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:58,790
I'm really sorry.

577
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,948
Will you read to me?

578
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,388
Where were you?

579
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:11,228
- Out.
- I called.

580
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:13,070
I know.

581
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,348
Listen, about what you heard
on the phone...

582
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:23,350
I don't want
to talk about it.

583
01:06:31,229 --> 01:06:34,188
- Shane's asleep.
- Oh.

584
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,029
Good.

585
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,708
Matt? Matt?

586
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,428
Shane?
Shane?!

587
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,067
Kate.

588
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,227
Oh, my God.

589
01:09:18,269 --> 01:09:21,788
Look, mommy, I'm big now.

590
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,667
Shane?

591
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:33,627
It's not loaded.

592
01:09:33,629 --> 01:09:35,348
Aah!

593
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,108
I know where you keep
your bullets, too!

594
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:40,548
Shane, give me the gun.

595
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,910
- I hate you!
- No! No!

596
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,948
Look at me, Shane.

597
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:52,107
- You lied to me.
- To protect you.

598
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:55,068
You said
we'd be together.

599
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,828
Forever.

600
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,547
Would you like that?

601
01:09:59,549 --> 01:10:01,467
Yes?

602
01:10:01,469 --> 01:10:03,550
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

603
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,590
It's gonna be okay.

604
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:13,668
Come here.

605
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:16,148
It's gonna be okay.

606
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,547
Hmm.

607
01:10:17,549 --> 01:10:19,428
It's okay.

608
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,828
Aah!

609
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:29,268
Stop it,
stop it now!

610
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:59,069
Shh.

611
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:06,668
Easy.

612
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:09,908
- Easy, easy.
- Ow.

613
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:11,590
Oh...

614
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,308
Ahh.

615
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:25,508
What happened?

616
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:29,508
You hit your head.

617
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:32,508
Ohh.

618
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,790
Where is Shane?

619
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,068
Matt?

620
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:44,150
Where is he?

621
01:11:49,229 --> 01:11:52,947
He's dead.

622
01:11:52,949 --> 01:11:54,867
What?

623
01:11:54,869 --> 01:11:57,588
How?

624
01:11:57,590 --> 01:12:01,068
We... We were fighting
for the gun and he...

625
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:03,387
he got shot.

626
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:11,549
Where is the body?

627
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:16,510
I... I took it outside.

628
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:21,550
Oh...

629
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,307
Shh.

630
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:07,908
It's okay.

631
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:09,627
It's okay.

632
01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:24,627
Kate?

633
01:14:27,749 --> 01:14:29,228
Kate?

634
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,108
Kate?

635
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:42,788
Kate!

636
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,708
Kate! Kate!

637
01:15:27,029 --> 01:15:29,108
What are we gonna do?

638
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,467
About what?

639
01:15:31,469 --> 01:15:34,268
About this place.

640
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,950
I don't think
I can live here anymore.

641
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,750
Why not?

642
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:46,347
You... You have...
food on your lip.

643
01:15:46,349 --> 01:15:47,787
Oh.

644
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:50,069
Oh.

645
01:15:55,829 --> 01:15:58,188
Where can we go? We...

646
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:02,067
We have no money.
No jobs.

647
01:16:02,069 --> 01:16:04,870
At least here,
the room will provide.

648
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:18,389
It's been hard but...
we'll get over it.

649
01:16:46,589 --> 01:16:48,749
Eat your food.

650
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,108
Agh!

651
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:03,629
What do you want to do?

652
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,548
What are you doing?

653
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,867
- Is this what you like?
- Stop!

654
01:19:42,869 --> 01:19:45,708
Don't worry,
I saw you two do it.

655
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,669
Aah!

656
01:19:52,589 --> 01:19:55,268
Hey, mom.

657
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,628
Aah!

658
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:05,187
Help! Help!

659
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,987
Aah!

660
01:21:06,989 --> 01:21:08,427
Ugh!

661
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:40,467
Shh! Shh!

662
01:23:14,429 --> 01:23:16,227
- Kate!
- Aah!

663
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:19,107
Honey, come on,
we have to go.

664
01:23:19,109 --> 01:23:22,467
- Matt?
- Yes, it's me, come on.

665
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:24,468
He looks just like you.

666
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:27,267
- Kate!
- Aah!

667
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:29,988
No, no, no, Kate, don't listen
to him, it's the room.

668
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:31,508
- Come with me.
- No, no, no!

669
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:33,908
Don't listen to him!
Kate, it's me.

670
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,387
No, Kate,
come with me, come on.

671
01:23:36,389 --> 01:23:39,228
Please.

672
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:41,667
June bug.

673
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:43,028
It's me.

674
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:45,308
Yes, June bug.

675
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,508
Come on.
Let's go.

676
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:52,188
Shane?

677
01:24:13,349 --> 01:24:14,828
Oh, shit.

678
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:31,587
We're still in the room.

679
01:24:50,429 --> 01:24:53,708
He's playing with us.

680
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,188
I've got an idea.

681
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,989
Mommy?

682
01:25:26,669 --> 01:25:28,510
Daddy?

683
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:32,388
Daddy!

684
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:34,028
Ugh!

685
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,468
Mommy?

686
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,987
It's okay, mommy.

687
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:04,868
Mommy! No!

688
01:26:18,389 --> 01:26:19,748
Go.

689
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:48,387
Aah!

690
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,587
Come on!

691
01:27:07,709 --> 01:27:10,508
Mommy!

692
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:12,348
Mommy!

693
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:13,548
Ahh!

694
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:24,548
Aah!

695
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,547
No! Mommy!

696
01:27:26,549 --> 01:27:28,308
Aah!

697
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:32,067
Mommy! Mommy!

698
01:27:32,069 --> 01:27:34,467
Mommy...

699
01:27:34,469 --> 01:27:38,067
Please.

700
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:40,068
Please.

701
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:51,147
Mommy.

702
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:06,428
Honey, open up,
I got your coffee.

703
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,588
Kate?

704
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,749
Kate?

705
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:50,868
Kate!

706
01:35:07,652 --> 01:35:12,652
