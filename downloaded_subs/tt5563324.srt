1
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,416
How was the jog?

2
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,333
It was good.

3
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,791
Hurry up and get out of there.
This place is supposed to be fun.

4
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,041
What?

5
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,958
You look beautiful.

6
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,950
- All right.
- All right.

7
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,708
- You ready?
- Yep.

8
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,791
Let's go.

9
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,333
Wow. No phones?

10
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,000
This is a real-deal date night. Okay.

11
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,916
A...

12
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,250
L...

13
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,208
T.

14
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,291
"Gestalt" is a person. Sorry.

15
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,593
- And a word.
- That's an interesting theory.

16
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,250
It's also one of those fact thingies.

17
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
- I'm gonna challenge you.
- Okay.

18
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:35,041
"Gestalt. An organized whole
that is perceived as more than..." Damn it.

19
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,163
- Are you sure you wanna keep fighting?
- Yeah, yeah.

20
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,333
It's just that I'm so much better
than you. I'm sorry.

21
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,125
By the way,
speaking of an organized whole...

22
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,375
Beg your pardon?

23
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,750
I was referring to our housewarming party.

24
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,125
But in the weirdest way possible.

25
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,166
I sent out that Evite this morning.

26
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,375
Oh, yes. Thank you for doing that.

27
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,416
Oops...

28
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,416
Two...

29
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,916
So, did you, uh... did you feel anything?

30
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,416
Huh?

31
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,833
I noticed you checking in the shower.

32
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Mm.

33
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,458
Okay. That makes sense.

34
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,208
Now, that's why you were
looking at me like that at the house.

35
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,250
Listen to me.

36
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,916
If it happens again,

37
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,416
we'll deal with it again.

38
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,625
Together.

39
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,958
Loser still has to do the laundry.

40
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,625
I hate you so much.

41
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,458
I hate you too.

42
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:43,958
Come here.

43
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,375
All right. Gimme that.

44
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,635
You're still good
with the party on the 18th?

45
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,186
'Cause that's what I put on the Evite.

46
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I think that's perfect.

47
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,750
Any later than that,
and it gets too close to Thanksgiving...

48
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,541
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
Wait a minute. Come here.

49
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,291
What?

50
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,708
I'm proud of what we built.

51
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,708
- Well, you built it.
- Yeah. But I built it for you.

52
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,916
I built it for us.

53
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,541
How about a movie?

54
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,625
Movie? I thought this was a date night.

55
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,791
That is a much better idea.

56
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,291
What?

57
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,041
Did you leave the back door open?

58
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,041
No.

59
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,541
Henry?

60
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,375
Henry?

61
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,958
No. The back door was closed...

62
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Hey. You okay?

63
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,666
Yeah. I, um...

64
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,500
What if they tried to hurt us?

65
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,333
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

66
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,250
Listen, they just...
they just wanted our stuff.

67
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,416
Really?

68
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,416
Yeah.

69
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,625
Okay. Then why didn't they take anything?

70
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,375
I don't know.

71
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,083
It's kind of embarrassing, really.

72
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,416
Yeah. I mean, what's wrong with our stuff?

73
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Right?

74
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,833
We have good stuff.

75
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,916
I'm gonna have one more look around. Okay?
I'll be right up.

76
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,416
Okay.

77
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,250
I think it's getting
a little better.

78
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,166
I don't always feel so mad at her.

79
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
The breathing exercises...

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,101
I think about having to change schools
and everything,

81
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,845
and I just get pissed
at her all over again.

82
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,083
Well, moving can be difficult.

83
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,791
It sucks.

84
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,791
Well, it depends where you move to.

85
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,916
You know,
you might even like the East Coast. I did.

86
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,250
- Did you grow up there?
- No. No.

87
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,375
I grew up in India,
and then I moved to Boston for university.

88
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,083
- What made you stay?
- My husband. We met there.

89
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,458
What did he do to convince you?
Maybe it'd work on my mom.

90
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,875
Well, he, um,
wooed me with a cheap souvenir.

91
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,125
Uh, he bought me a clock
on our first date.

92
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,791
That's kind of a weird gift.

93
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,250
- No offense.
- I still have that clock.

94
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,583
So, basically,
you're saying I should bribe her?

95
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:23,041
Basically, I'm saying
maybe you should not be so pissed at her.

96
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,750
Not for trying to be a good mom.

97
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,458
Were your kids pissed at you
for moving here?

98
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,833
Mm. We... We don't... We don't have any kids.

99
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,333
No.

100
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,798
You know, I can get you in on...

101
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,833
Hi, Mom. Thanks.

102
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,291
How about the 23rd? You wanna get some...

103
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,916
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Mr. Parsons.

104
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,833
Detective Morse.

105
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:15,958
Corrales PD.

106
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,875
Hi. Yeah, um... Come on in.

107
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,500
Two cell phones and one laptop.

108
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,291
That's it?

109
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,250
Pretty specific list of items they took.

110
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,245
Why'd you and your wife
leave your cell phones behind?

111
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,458
We used to be tied to 'em. Especially me.

112
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,666
And we decided when we moved

113
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,541
that when we're together,
nothing should get in the way of it.

114
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,791
- How long the two of you been married?
- Twelve years.

115
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,791
And when did you move to Corrales?

116
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,666
Came out about a year ago to break ground,

117
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,916
and then we finally moved in
about two months ago.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,458
Boston's a rat race, and we were looking
for the exact opposite.

119
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,291
Make any enemies
since you've been here?

120
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,625
Uh, um...

121
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,333
I don't think what happened
was anything personal. Why? Do you?

122
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,166
Part of what we're trying to figure out.

123
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,708
What about back in Boston?

124
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,666
Back in Boston?

125
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,750
Did you leave
any enemies behind there?

126
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:19,375
None that would fly across the country
to... to break into my home. No.

127
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,333
It's a nice place.

128
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,958
It's big.

129
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,958
You design it yourself?

130
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,833
- Yep.
- Hmm.

131
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
What?

132
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:38,250
I'm just surprised you didn't install
an alarm system, that's all.

133
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,083
Well, I was under the impression
that Corrales was safe.

134
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,208
How long were you and your wife gone
from the house that night?

135
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,833
- Couple hours.
- So, two?

136
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,876
- Yeah. Like, two or three.
- Which? Two or three?

137
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,458
I'm trying to put together
a timeline here. So, I'd need to know...

138
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,958
My wife is rattled about what happened.
Okay? And I know you are doing your job.

139
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,166
- I am.
- My job's to make her feel safe.

140
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,750
So what can I tell her you guys are doing
that might make that happen?

141
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,000
Sounds like you need a plumber.

142
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,833
I'll add it to the list.

143
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,833
You tell her...

144
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,458
...we're tracking a few leads.

145
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,791
So, good news.

146
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,958
The lump you felt was probably
just a residual build-up of scar tissue.

147
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,500
- Oh.
- I see no indication of cancer returning.

148
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,333
Okay.

149
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,250
Okay. I just, um...
I just... just wanted to be really sure.

150
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,500
Of course. Here, you can keep a copy.

151
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,666
Yeah. Thank you.

152
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,041
How are you feeling otherwise?

153
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm... I'm okay. Just... just very tired.

154
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,500
I, um, heard about the break-in.

155
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,958
Corrales is a small town.

156
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,416
What you don't hear about at church,
you read about in the police log.

157
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:29,833
I know this is your field,
but if you ever need to speak to someone...

158
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,083
Oh. No. No.
Thank you so much. I'm... I'm okay.

159
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,125
- You're sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:39,041
My... my husband, he helps in that way.

161
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,416
A lot, actually.

162
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:46,083
He's really good at, um, at being there
and dealing with all my stuff.

163
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,583
He could have walked away.
Most people would have in that position.

164
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:56,041
And I was impossible
to be around sometimes,

165
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,083
but he stayed with me
and supported me through all of it.

166
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,083
Idiot.

167
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,875
- Henry?
- In here.

168
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,875
Actually, wait a second.

169
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,125
What's happening?

170
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,250
Okay. Come on in.

171
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,333
Okay.

172
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Ta-da!

173
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,250
- You fixed our pictures.
- Yeah. And the shelf.

174
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,916
And the hallway light,
and the... the desk chair.

175
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,416
But, hey, who's counting? Right?

176
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,625
Wow. Look at you.

177
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,416
Oh.

178
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,916
Oh. Hold on.
This wasn't here before. Was it?

179
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,416
No. I added some new ones.

180
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,666
- Hmm.
- Oh.

181
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,416
Aren't you the best?

182
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,166
Yeah. Well, nothing inspires you
like a good burglary.

183
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,083
Hey. I noticed
the light and locks you installed.

184
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,375
- Are you expecting to need them?
- It's just me being me.

185
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,500
I also bought us two new phones.

186
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,416
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

187
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,041
And I installed
a location tracker app, so,

188
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,458
you know, if you ever get worried
about being alone...

189
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,833
Did you also get a new computer?

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Henry?

191
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,708
Henry.

192
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,416
Come on. You can't be mad at me for this.

193
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,125
I just wanted to be sure
before I said something to you.

194
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,166
But we can't hide things
from each other, Meera.

195
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,375
We... We're not that couple.

196
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,583
You're... You're right.

197
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,466
I just didn't wanna worry you
if there was nothing to be worried about.

198
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,125
I need to know these things.
How else am I gonna take care of you?

199
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
Is everything okay?

200
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.

201
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,083
I'm sorry.

202
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,666
Come here.

203
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,041
I love you so much.

204
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:23,875
I love you too.

205
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,750
Henry?

206
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,625
- Henry.
- Hmm?

207
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,291
The power's out.

208
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,416
Looks like it rained earlier.
The storm probably knocked it out.

209
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,875
I'll check the generator.

210
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,458
Thank you.

211
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,250
God.

212
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,958
Whoa.

213
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,250
Meera.

214
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,208
Okay. You're... You're okay.

215
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,958
Shh.

216
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,875
Okay.

217
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,250
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Shh.

218
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,750
Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on.

219
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,416
Listen. Stay here. I'll be right back.

220
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
- No, no, no. Please don't go. Please.
- Stay. No. I'll be right back.

221
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,541
All right. Stay.

222
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,916
Okay. Come on.

223
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,500
Come on.

224
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,416
- Henry!
- They're over here!

225
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,333
Get him!

226
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,791
- Get his gun!
- Get him! Get him!

227
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,208
Henry!

228
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,958
Go! Run! Go, go, go!

229
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,250
Get him!

230
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,517
Go! Go!

231
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,791
Open the door!

232
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,166
Open!

233
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,250
- Here. Take these keys and get to the car.
- What? What?

234
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,541
I'll lower you down.

235
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:28,458
- Come on. Please. I've got you. I got you.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

236
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,500
- Ahh! Henry! Henry!
- I've got you. Hold on! Hold on!

237
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,666
Grab onto my arm. I'll lower you down.

238
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,250
Henry. Henry.

239
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,458
It's okay. Ready?

240
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,416
Go!

241
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,750
I'm okay. I'm okay.

242
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,291
Henry! Henry!

243
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,017
- Henry! What's happening?
- Get him!

244
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,916
No! No! Don't!

245
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,833
- No! Please. Leave him alone! Please.
- Run! Run! Go!

246
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay.

247
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,208
Henry!

248
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,208
Henry!

249
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,375
Oh my God!

250
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,666
Okay.

251
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay.

252
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,666
No. No.

253
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,791
Please.

254
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,166
All right, buddy. Come out with me.

256
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,708
How long had it been there in the house?

257
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,791
I had it back in Boston too.

258
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,833
I thought we were not "that couple."

259
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,386
Would you have let me keep it in the house
if you had known about it?

260
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,750
- No.
- That is exactly why I did not tell you.

261
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:15,666
It's gone now.

262
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,000
- The cops have it.
- Yeah.

263
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,458
Instead of it being stashed
in one of my plants.

264
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,666
I thought it was a good idea.

265
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,625
A fantastic idea. Every home
should have a hidden weapons cache.

266
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,416
It was one gun.

267
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,916
And we're lucky we had it.

268
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,125
Okay. They're here.

269
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:53,708
Here they are.

270
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:06,125
- Who... who are they?
- They're from Eagle Point.

271
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,958
It's a trailer park across town.

272
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,916
Poor community.
A lot more crime than around here.

273
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,750
He was a career criminal.
Mostly drug-related.

274
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,500
Same for these other two.

275
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,166
We plan on questioning him if we can.

276
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,458
Who?

277
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,041
He's in the ICU at Saint Mary's.

278
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,750
- It's not looking good.
- Wait. They're... they're still alive?

279
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,166
- Just him.
- Troopers are gonna wanna talk to him too.

280
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,541
- I'm sure.
- What are you talking about?

281
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:40,541
Who are these people?

282
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,142
I know some of their names and faces,
some of the stuff that they've done,

283
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,458
but beyond that...

284
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,875
I might even peg them
for what happened to you folks. Maybe.

285
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,166
You know it seems to fit...

286
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,791
but there's another matter.

287
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,708
A girl from around here
has been missing for a month.

288
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,708
Christine Cobb.

289
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,750
Freshman at the community college.

290
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:13,916
State Police think that these men have
something to do with her disappearance.

291
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,416
And the thing is,
if this guy doesn't pull through,

292
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,666
they might never find her.

293
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,500
Gosh. Her poor family.

294
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,125
I don't think you understand, ma'am.

295
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,750
These men <i>are</i> her family.

296
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,625
Fixed my drafting table.

297
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,708
You're leaving?

298
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:14,041
Yeah. I'm just gonna get the rest
of the stuff for the housewarming party.

299
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,291
You still wanna have it?

300
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,666
Yeah. Yeah. I think it'd be good for us.
Don't you?

301
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,708
I'm not gonna be gone long,
I'm just going downtown to Grayson's.

302
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,416
They close at eight on Sundays.

303
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,708
Are you okay staying here?

304
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,583
Or you could just not worry
about the party.

305
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,875
- Meera.
- Or fixing furniture.

306
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:36,875
Stop.

307
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,976
For God's sakes,
you're acting like nothing happened.

308
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes. I am trying to.

309
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,125
- You killed these people.
- Who were going to kill us.

310
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,708
But still, does that...
does that even register for you?

311
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,583
Of course, it does!
It makes me sick to my stomach!

312
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,166
Apparently, not enough
to make you shirk on social obligations.

313
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,666
- We have to get past this.
- It just happened! Okay?

314
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,291
What if there are more of them out there?

315
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,625
How... how do we get past that?

316
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,291
You're... you're scared.

317
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,708
I am too.

318
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,250
But we... we have been scared before,

319
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,333
and we got through it...

320
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,791
together by fixing the damage.

321
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,041
Hey.

322
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,875
By inviting friends over,

323
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,875
I'm just... I'm... I'm...

324
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,166
I'm just trying
to get back to normal. That's it.

325
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,291
I can... I can go to the store another day.

326
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,458
No. No, no, no. Just...

327
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,416
Just, um...

328
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:58,875
Just go.

329
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,458
You sure?

330
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,250
Yeah. I'm sure. I'll be okay.

331
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,125
I love you, you know.

332
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,250
I love you too.

333
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,916
Mm.

334
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:38,708
Oh.

335
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,208
Henry?

336
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,208
<i>Hi.
You've reached Henry Parsons.</i>

337
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:55,625
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

338
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,416
Hey. Hey. It's me. It's me.

339
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Well, you're not gonna have
much luck paying

340
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,375
'cause you left your wallet here.

341
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,500
Uh, hopefully, you'll listen to this
before you get there.

342
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,375
Okay. Bye.

343
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,916
Um, you know, I...

344
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,750
You know what? I think I'm gonna try
and catch up to you with it.

345
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,958
Where are you going?

346
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,666
Hey! Where you been?
Did you go for a drive or something?

347
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,833
I tried calling you.

348
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,750
Oh shit. Yeah.
It went straight to voicemail. Sorry.

349
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,333
Is something wrong?

350
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,791
I... I got into an accident.

351
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,708
Oh my... Oh my God. Are you okay?

352
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:16,750
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I... I was just trying to catch up to you,

353
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:20,250
and you turned off away from town
towards a hospital.

354
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,916
Yeah. I made a wrong turn.
I barely made it to... to Grayson's on time.

355
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,583
Oh, right.

356
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,708
I realized it, but, thankfully,

357
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,711
the owner said
I could come back next week, so...

358
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,208
- Gotta love small towns. Huh?
- Yeah.

359
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:44,791
Where's your car now?

360
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:48,041
Uh, they towed it to a body shop.
I just took an Uber home.

361
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,750
Okay. I'll take care of it.

362
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,958
Don't worry.
Good thing is you're okay. Right?

363
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Hmm.

364
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:48,791
Meera?

365
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,708
Have a good night!

366
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,291
Yeah. Good night.

367
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,458
Oh, I almost forgot. Um...

368
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,833
- I'm sorry about your party.
- What?

369
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:34,916
The housewarming party?
I... I got the Evite cancellation.

370
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:37,958
Oh. Okay.

371
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,041
Okay.

372
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:05,875
God.

373
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,250
Heard about your accident. You okay?

374
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,416
Yeah. I'm fine.

375
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,416
This new?

376
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,708
Leather seats. In-dash GPS.

377
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:21,000
Well, it's my husband's.

378
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,458
There's, uh,
something I think you should know.

379
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,375
The man who broke into your house,
the one that was still alive?

380
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,375
He's not anymore.

381
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,583
Um. Well, um...

382
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,875
Wasn't he in the ICU or something?

383
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,333
And showing signs of improvement.

384
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,625
Anyway,

385
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:48,750
I figured you might feel better
knowing that it's over.

386
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,208
Thank you.

387
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,750
When did he die?

388
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,833
Sunday night.

389
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:02,916
Take care.

390
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,083
Oh God.

391
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,916
The hell are you doing?

392
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:47,000
- Nothing.
- Don't tell me "nothing."

393
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,833
Why are you snooping around?

394
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,375
I'm not. I just... I...
I just came to visit someone...

395
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:52,458
Bullshit!

396
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,416
I seen your car here the other day too.

397
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:57,756
My car? I don't...
I've never been here before.

398
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,750
Mind your business. Do you hear me?

399
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,250
Okay. Okay. I-I'm sorry. I...

400
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,208
What is that?

401
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,291
- This is not mine.
- Give me that.

402
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,375
That's not mine.

403
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:14,083
You've been videotaping me?

404
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:15,000
- No.
- Huh?

405
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,643
No, no, no. I just...
I'm telling you it's... it's not mine. I...

406
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,041
No. Please. Please. Please. Please.

407
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,166
- Don't come back here.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

408
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,666
<i>My daughter, Christine...</i>

409
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,416
<i>I saw the way he looked at her.</i>

410
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,416
<i>So instead of trying to blame me,</i>

411
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,541
<i>try believing me.</i>

412
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:47,916
Shit.

413
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:05,750
- Oh. Hi.
- Hey.

414
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,541
Oh God.

415
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,916
Looks good. Doesn't it?

416
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:10,458
What?

417
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,125
My office.
I pretty much fixed all the damage.

418
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:17,083
Oh. I, uh, haven't...
I haven't checked it yet.

419
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,000
Okay.

420
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,291
Oh. It's a blocked number.

421
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,666
Um...

422
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,333
- I don't know who that is, actually.
- Oh, hey.

423
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,250
Using the, uh, tracking app.

424
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,875
- Oh yeah. I... I did. Yeah.
- I did too, actually.

425
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:51,625
- Oh.
- What were you doing across town earlier?

426
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:53,583
Oh. Um...

427
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,916
Uh. You know, I, um, texted you,
and I got a little worried.

428
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,625
Thing said you were near Eagle Point or...

429
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:05,291
Oh. Sorry. I actually did come
in here earlier. I... I was gonna vacuum.

430
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,375
Hmm.

431
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,166
- With what?
- Well, that's what I was saying.

432
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,041
I... I came in here
and didn't need to do anything.

433
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,375
So...

434
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:19,750
- So, I'm just gonna go and freshen up.
- Okay.

435
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,458
Oh, hey, I got your car fixed.

436
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,083
Thank you.

437
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,750
Not hungry?

438
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm fine.

439
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,125
You never really answered me.

440
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:55,166
About what you...
you were doing across town earlier.

441
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,500
Nothing. Just...

442
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,791
- Just driving.
- To where?

443
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,166
Um. Ho-home.

444
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,625
From where?

445
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,083
From work.

446
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,166
Hmm.

447
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,458
Seems like a real roundabout way home.
Don't you think?

448
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,583
What?

449
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:51,208
You're not hiding anything from me.
Are you?

450
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,733
What... What would I hide from you?

451
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,500
What would I hide from you, Henry?

452
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:05,541
Results.

453
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:10,083
Oh. Um...

454
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:11,791
No.

455
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:16,541
I... I... I haven't even been back
to the doctors.

456
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:30,458
I thought there was
a s-specialist or something

457
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,291
you've been going to around there.

458
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,208
Something you didn't wanna tell me. Hm.

459
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,375
I am... I am so sorry.

460
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:38,125
Meera?

461
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:18,916
Hello?

462
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,125
- <i>Meera. Hey. It's Joanne.</i>
- Oh, hi.

463
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:24,226
<i>I'm sorry to call so early. But we need
to change your schedule around a bit.</i>

464
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,166
Okay.

465
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,625
<i>Mrs. Hernandez called. She needs
to switch her weekly sessions to Thursdays</i>

466
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,500
<i>because she has a...</i>

467
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,250
<i>I can switch her, but then, I'd have to...</i>

468
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:36,208
Um. When... when was this?

469
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:38,708
Hey. Wanna get out
of the car, man? Come on.

470
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,416
- I got it.
- Let me go!

471
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,583
Let me go or I swear...

472
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:46,625
Let go! I didn't mean to hurt her!

473
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:53,750
You don't understand.
That bitch wanted to!

474
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:58,791
<i>Meera?
Meera, are you still there?</i>

475
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:02,166
Yeah. Y-Yes.
I'm... I'm... I'm here. I'm here. Um...

476
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:05,166
I'll come by later
and take care of everything.

477
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,750
Thank you so much.

478
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:32,750
Applesauce in the mix?

479
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,250
Okay. If you say so.

480
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:41,708
Hey.

481
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,875
Where... where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

482
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,833
They found that missing girl.

483
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,250
Uh, they... they did? Is she okay?

484
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't think so.

485
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:55,958
How do you know?

486
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,875
Why does he have
one of your envelopes, Henry?

487
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,208
- Who?
- The man who broke into our house.

488
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,000
I went to his trailer.

489
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,625
Two days after you did.

490
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,250
I need you to tell me
you have nothing to do

491
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,791
with any of this, Henry.

492
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,208
Meera...

493
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:27,708
I need you to tell me why you had
a gun that you never told me about,

494
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:32,458
or why you have some s-secret password
on your filing cabinet.

495
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:37,250
And I really need to know why you have
a picture of that missing girl, Henry.

496
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:44,583
I couldn't do it.

497
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,375
I thought I could, but I couldn't.

498
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:49,833
Do... Uh...

499
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:52,208
Do... do what, Henry? Do what?

500
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:54,625
I thought if we tightened our belt
for a while,

501
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:57,333
and, you know,
got a good rate from the bank, um...

502
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,750
What are you talking about?

503
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,916
This house. Meera, look... look at it.

504
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,158
Did you ever ask yourself
how we were able to afford it?

505
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,375
Well, you... you make a good living.

506
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:12,333
Yeah. I do now.
But that wasn't always the case.

507
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:15,291
And I didn't wanna say anything
'cause I didn't wanna worry you, but...

508
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,625
our insurance had only covered
so much of your treatments.

509
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,541
We were running on fumes for a while.

510
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:25,333
Okay. Then, um, how did we afford it?

511
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:29,416
I had to find a way
to bring construction costs down.

512
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,875
The first step was
taking over as contractor,

513
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,625
and the second step was

514
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:39,166
making the IRS think
I pretty much built it alone.

515
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,916
But you had dozens of people building it.

516
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,625
Yeah. And that girl's father
was one of them.

517
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:48,666
And I knew he was a junkie,
but I didn't know he was violent

518
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,625
until one day
his daughter drops by the job site,

519
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,916
the same day
that photo must have been taken.

520
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,500
And she crashed his truck, like,
jumped the curb or something.

521
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,833
And he just starts wailing on her
in front of everybody.

522
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:05,625
I couldn't believe it. And I fired him,
right there on the spot.

523
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,833
And he promised me
that I was gonna pay for it,

524
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,250
which I did, literally, for...

525
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,208
almost a year.

526
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:18,708
Every month, in that envelope,
which is what I was hoping

527
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:23,208
I'd find at his trailer, 'cause I think
it's the only proof there is.

528
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,750
But I don't understand.
If money was the issue in the first place,

529
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:27,833
why would you pay him?

530
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:30,125
I was committing fraud.
I could've gone to prison.

531
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:31,808
- So could have he.
- But he didn't care.

532
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:36,041
This is a guy who, instead of worrying
about his missing daughter,

533
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:40,000
he decided
to break into our house be-because...

534
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,625
Because why?

535
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:45,953
'Cause I stopped paying him.

536
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:47,833
Oh.

537
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:49,916
Jesus, Henry.

538
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:54,541
Look. All I... all I ever wanted was for us
to be happy. It's why I built the house.

539
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,750
We were given a chance
to grow old together, and I...

540
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,166
I wanted to do that
somewhere that felt like a home.

541
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,375
N-Not... Not a house. A home.

542
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,625
And I... I made some mistakes.

543
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:16,166
But now you know what they are.
I got nothing else to hide.

544
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,000
And as... as for the, uh,
the code on my filing cabinet,

545
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,958
I wouldn't exactly call it a secret.

546
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:25,833
It's 0-8-1-2.

547
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:27,333
August 12th.

548
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:31,708
Our anniversary.

549
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,583
I'm sorry.

550
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,041
...to be here Wednesday...
Please hold.

551
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:07,791
- Meera?
- Yeah?

552
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:10,625
- This package came in the mail for you.
- What's that?

553
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,250
Oh yeah. Thanks.

554
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:19,416
Do you wanna keep it? It's a video camera.

555
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,583
- Why would I keep it?
- Maybe for your son.

556
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:25,333
Oh. Well... you know,
I assume he'd just use his phone. Right?

557
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,166
- Right.
- Okay.

558
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,500
Okay. Bye.

559
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,041
Okay. This looks good. Right?

560
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:43,458
Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Hey, um,
maybe try putting all the big ones

561
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,583
on the same side?

562
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:47,791
Kinda like it not being too matchy-matchy.

563
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,708
I just design things for a living.
What do I know?

564
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,916
Not how to shut up and clean, apparently.

565
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,958
Yeah. Biryani, pot roast.
Oh, and the salad.

566
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,416
- Yeah. That should be good.
- Plus the whore d'oeuvres.

567
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:07,625
The what?

568
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:08,750
Uh, whore d'oeuvres?

569
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,541
What? Huh?

570
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:15,708
- Uh, it's hors d'oeuvres.
- What did I say?

571
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:18,083
- You did not say that.
- Okay. Spell it.

572
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:20,000
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

573
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,541
H-O...

574
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,125
- H-O-R...
- Uh, uh<i>...</i>

575
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,333
Not so smart, after all. Are we?

576
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:27,500
- Just trust me. It's hors d'oeuvres.
- Okay.

577
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,541
Please tell me
you've called it that in public.

578
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:30,500
Proudly.

579
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,833
- Oh my God, you're crazy.
- Uh, someone's here early.

580
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,333
Oh. That's Bill and Joanne.

581
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:42,250
Okay. I'm gonna go check in
on the biryani, and the "whores."

582
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,208
Hey, Henry.

583
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:48,208
- Hey. I hope we're not too early.
- You're right on time. Come on up.

Hey, guys. I just wanted you to know
that dessert will be out in a minute.

598
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:49,000
Thanks. The game's
pretty much over anyway.

599
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:52,583
Uh. You can... I'll take the rest.
Don't worry. Thank you so much.

600
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,875
<i>Tune in tonight
for our special report</i>

601
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:59,125
<i>on an Eagle Point man</i>

602
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:03,416
<i>who was arraigned today in district court
for charges of animal cruelty.</i>

603
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,125
<i>The lead investigator in the case made
the following statement earlier today.</i>

604
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:11,000
<i>Officers found several dogs locked up
in Mr. Oxbow's shed.</i>

605
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:13,916
<i>Most had severe cuts and bite marks
from being forced to participate</i>

606
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,125
<i>in illegal dog fights.</i>

607
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,708
<i>And one dog,
a female, was found dead at the scene.</i>

608
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:20,708
<i>Clint Oxbow was also a person of interest
in the disappearance</i>

609
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:25,666
<i>of local college student Christine Cobb
but has since been dismissed as a suspect.</i>

610
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:53,666
<i>This is Dylan Cobb. I know what
you police think of me and my family,</i>

611
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,750
<i>but none of that matters anymore.</i>

612
01:04:56,833 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>The only thing that matters now
is me finding my little girl.</i>

613
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,291
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

614
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:05,208
<i>I've been in that house before,
before the other night.</i>

615
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,375
<i>I worked on it when it was being built.</i>

616
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:13,583
<i>My daughter, Christine, came over one day,
and I saw the way he looked at her.</i>

617
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:15,500
<i>So, when she came up missing,</i>

618
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:17,833
<i>the son of a bitch
was the first person I thought of.</i>

619
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,708
<i>We waited till one night nobody was home.</i>

620
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,375
<i>Took my dog, Hershel.</i>

621
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,208
<i>Sure enough,</i>

622
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,250
<i>barking like crazy,
especially in the office.</i>

623
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,125
<i>That guy's got
more evidence in that house.</i>

624
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:32,291
<i>I know it! So instead of trying...</i>

625
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,750
- Here you go. Shh.
- Okay.

626
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,916
- Thanks.
- You got it.

627
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:41,875
- All right.
- Cheers.

628
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:45,958
Nice stretch of land you got here, Henry.
A lot of privacy.

629
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:50,416
Yeah.

630
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,250
Oh God.

631
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,041
Mm.

632
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:12,916
Hello?

633
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:58,541
Oh.

634
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:01,875
Oh my God.

635
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:32,916
Hello?

636
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,500
Hello, Christine?

637
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,500
Okay.

638
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:55,708
Christine?

639
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,125
Christine?

640
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:00,666
Oh my God.

641
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:21,083
No, no, no. Stop.

642
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:23,541
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

643
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:27,625
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

644
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,833
Just trust me. Okay?

645
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:32,000
Listen to me. There are people upstairs.

646
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,416
I'm gonna get some help. Okay?

647
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,000
Trust me.

648
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:38,083
You're gonna be okay.
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

649
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:39,166
Ahh!

650
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,708
Henry.

651
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:49,375
What... what are you?

652
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:54,458
Um... I'm... I'm...

653
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:56,541
your husband.

654
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,458
It's just the urges that...

655
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:03,875
...I've always had.

656
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:08,541
Well, I... I didn't wanna be this way.

657
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:11,500
I didn't choose to be this way.

658
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:19,125
This is why you built this house.
It was not for us.

659
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:27,833
This is how there is an us.

660
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:47,125
What are you doing, Meera?

661
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:53,000
Meera, please put... put it away, put the...
Meera, put the phone down.

662
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:58,250
Put down that phone.

663
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:06,666
No!

664
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,333
After everything I've done for you.

665
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,458
No, no, no.

666
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:35,625
I have always been there for you,
no matter what.

667
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:37,666
No, no, no.

668
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:40,791
Henry, this isn't at all the same thing.

669
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:42,833
This isn't the same thing.

670
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:46,333
Let me ask you.
Did you choose for those things to happen?

671
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:47,416
Hmm?

672
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:48,833
The cancer?

673
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,333
The infertility that it caused?

674
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:54,513
The depression? No.

675
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:58,833
Your biology and your genetics,
they chose for you.

676
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:03,833
And mine chose this.

677
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:08,500
Meera...

678
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:14,000
...now you're going to be here for me.

679
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:24,333
No. Henry.

680
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:29,541
No, no, no, no, no.
Henry, don't let me... Don't leave me!

681
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:34,750
Help! Someone help! Help me!

682
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,291
Henry! Henry!

683
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:38,375
Ahh!

684
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,708
Whoa!

685
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,833
Yeah. I tripped, and I banged
my nose helping Meera to bed.

686
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,750
Is she feeling okay?

687
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:52,625
Yeah, yeah. She's fine,

688
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:55,375
just one too many mojitos
is all, you know?

689
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:57,708
Anyway, I'm, uh...
I'm sorry I have to do this,

690
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:00,083
but I think
we're gonna have to call it a night.

691
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:03,208
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

692
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:05,750
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys. Drive safe.

693
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,375
Good night, guys. Drive safe.

694
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,166
Who are you?

695
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,125
My name is Meera.

696
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:53,958
You know him?

697
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,250
I... I thought I did.

698
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:06,958
What... What did he do... What'd he do to you?

699
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,166
I don't know.

700
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,000
I barely remember.

701
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,250
I just remember being out one night,

702
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:20,250
and then I woke up here like this.

703
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,583
I don't even know
how long it's been.

704
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,416
He comes down here...

705
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,625
and he just sits there

706
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,500
with...

707
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:37,958
with the bat.

708
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,166
And all he ever says is,

709
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:45,416
"I decide when."

Please help me.

720
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,000
Please!

721
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:45,791
Please!

722
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:54,625
Okay, okay.
Let's get this out. You're okay.

723
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,333
Okay. Okay.

724
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:04,291
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

725
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:07,833
You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.

726
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:09,958
It's okay.

727
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:13,708
He's coming.

728
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,375
Meera? Honey?

729
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:30,291
We can get through this.
I know... I know we can.

730
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:34,208
And we can find a way
to trust each other again,

731
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:39,041
'cause there's... there's no more secrets,
and... and there's nothing else to hide.

732
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:08,333
Ahh!

733
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,500
No. This way. This way. This way.

734
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:29,333
You know,
you used to lie on the floor for...

735
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,625
for hours.

736
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:35,125
Yeah. You were too weak.
You couldn't get up.

737
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:37,750
Remember that, Meera?

738
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:41,958
'Cause I do.

739
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:48,500
Yeah. Because I had to carry you to bed

740
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:50,666
every night.

741
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,958
Bring you your food,
bring you to the bathroom.

742
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,958
You see, that's what you do
for the people that you love.

743
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,333
You don't turn on 'em. Okay?

744
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,041
You don't abandon them
when things get... get hard or...

745
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,583
or uncomfortable.

746
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:24,208
So you're gonna choose her over me? Hmm?

747
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:26,250
Over... over us?

748
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:29,666
O-Okay. All right.

749
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:32,083
You're gonna save her?

750
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:34,083
Hmm?

751
01:21:34,416 --> 01:21:35,416
Take care of her?

752
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:42,458
You can't even take care of yourself.

753
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,896
Christine, listen to me.

754
01:21:57,375 --> 01:22:00,291
No! Run! Go. Run!

755
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:11,375
Help me! Help!

756
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:15,208
Help! Help! Help!

757
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:16,291
Help!

758
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,541
No!

759
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,583
No.

760
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,708
No! Help!

761
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:04,916
No! Please!

762
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,958
Please! Please! Please!

763
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:17,333
Please! No! No! No!

764
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:32,791
Please. Please. Please. Please. Please.

765
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:39,833
I told you. I told you.

766
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,291
I decide when.

767
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:46,250
No. Please. No!

768
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:32,750
But who'll take care of you?

769
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,208
I will.

770
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,500
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

771
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:58,708
It's okay. It's okay.

772
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:00,958
Okay.

773
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,333
Come on.

774
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:07,541
Go. Go. Go.
