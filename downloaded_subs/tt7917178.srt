1
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,269
 I came to see you
in hospital

2
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,211
after your accident, but...

3
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,172
You didn't know who I was.

4
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,984
I went looking for you
when you got out,

5
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,135
but you were gone.

6
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,419
- Why were you looking for me?

7
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:23,930
- I might have a few days
work for you,

8
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,265
if you're interested.

9
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,017
Nothing physical.

10
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,186
- Doing what?

11
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,105
- Babysitting.

12
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,275
My brother ed died last year.

13
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,028
He had a daughter, Olga.

14
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,364
She keeps going out to the house
where he died.

15
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,343
The place is in the middle
of nowhere...

16
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,828
And I don't like the idea of her
being out there on her own.

17
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,830
She's out there now.

18
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,933
I've been looking for someone
to go out there

19
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,209
and keep her company.

20
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,086
I'd like to send someone I know.

21
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,296
What do you think?

22
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,883
I'll give you 200 a day.

23
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,136
I can't imagine you'll be there
for more than five days.

24
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,223
- How did your brother die?

25
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,811
- Suicide.

26
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,191
- Where's her mother?

27
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,026
- Missing.

28
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,028
Vanished eight months ago.

29
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,076
- She's your niece.
- Why don't you go yourself?

30
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,950
- Honestly,

31
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,910
I couldn't take a week
alone with her.

32
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
She's got some
psychological problems.

33
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,208
She goes into these states,
she gets confused,

34
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,001
but she's harmless.

35
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,797
- So 200 a day,

36
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,007
just to go to the house
and keep her company?

37
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,093
- That's it.

38
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,263
- There's got to be
more to it than that.

39
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,163
What's this?

40
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,986
Where's the house?

41
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,260
You didn't say anything about
the house being on an island.

42
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,328
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

43
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,348
- I told you the house
was isolated.

44
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,749
You agreed to go to the house.

45
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,519
What difference does it make
if it's surrounded by water?

46
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,170
- I can't swim.

47
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,628
- Well then it's lucky
we got a boat then, isn't it?

48
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,554
...

49
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,397
Olga, we're here.

50
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,525
- Is there anybody else
living on the island?

51
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,279
- Just a family of foxes.

52
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,656
You ever hear a fox crying?

53
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,199
- No.

54
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,118
- Sounds like a teenage girl
screaming.

55
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,455
You ever hear
a teenage girl scream?

56
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,248
- No.

57
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,459
 Sure.

58
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,563
There's something I didn't
mention before.

59
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,422
It's not really a big deal.

60
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,717
Olga's a little paranoid.

61
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,537
She doesn't like people getting
too close to her physically.

62
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,450
And she doesn't want anybody
going into her room,

63
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,641
especially at night.

64
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,601
- That's fine.

65
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,102
- What's fine?

66
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,437
- Stay out of her room.

67
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
- Well it's not
as simple as that.

68
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,277
She has this odd fear that
she'll be attacked in her sleep.

69
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,506
If I could find a woman willing
to go on the boat with me,

70
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,324
I'd hire her, but...

71
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,674
- What's that?

72
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,362
- Olga's grandmother
was a sleepwalker.

73
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,406
She used to wear this at night

74
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,224
to stop her walking out
into the woods.

75
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,368
- And why are you
showing it to me?

76
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,186
- I need you to put this on.

77
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,397
Well the chain's long enough.

78
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,857
You'll be able to walk around.

79
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,302
It just won't let you into
certain rooms, including Olga's.

80
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,121
- I have no interest
in going into her room.

81
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,280
- Well she needs a little more
than just your word.

82
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,657
Turn around, I'll strap you in.

83
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,617
- I'm not putting that on.

84
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,245
- I don't see what
the problem is.

85
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,539
It's a job.
Every job has a uniform.

86
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,165
- That's not a uniform.

87
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,417
That's a leash,
and I'm not putting it on.

88
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,211
- Well then we have a problem.

89
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,397
She'll only agree to have
someone stay with her

90
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,714
if they wear this.

91
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,259
- No.
- I don't like to have my time wasted.

92
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,384
- Look.

93
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,220
You didn't say anything
about an island.

94
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,699
And you sure as shit didn't say
anything about wearing a leash.

95
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,226
If you had, I wouldn't be here.

96
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,228
So this is not my problem.

97
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,190
- Come on.

98
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,234
What's the big deal?

99
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,461
See?

100
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,590
Some form of schizophrenia.

101
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,718
Catatonic stupor,
ed used to call it.

102
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,554
Happens when she gets excited.

103
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,473
She must've been looking
forward to meeting you.

104
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,267
- Can she hear us?

105
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,441
- I don't wanna leave her here
on her own but...

106
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,235
I can't leave you here with her
if you won't put that on.

107
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,448
Now I wanna be off this island
before it gets dark so...

108
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,658
What do ya wanna do?

109
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,790
- You hungry?

110
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Hello?

111
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,842
Hello?

112
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,187
- Come closer.

113
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,503
- Hello?

114
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,557
- It's just a fox.

115
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,022
- What're you doing with that?

116
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,108
You know how to use that?

117
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,986
- My father and my uncle
used to take me hunting.

118
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,073
What are you doing down here?

119
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,241
- I couldn't sleep.
- I was gonna light a fire.

120
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,367
- You can't.

121
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,744
It's blocked.

122
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,455
The whole room fills with smoke
when you try to light it.

123
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,458
My mother had it blocked
off after she found birds

124
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,460
living in the chimney.

125
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,462
She didn't want to disturb them.

126
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,389
- Barrett says she's missing.

127
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,936
- What's been done to find her?

128
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,479
- Nothing.

129
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,402
Were you close with my uncle?

130
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,321
- He said we're friends
but I don't remember.

131
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,491
Doesn't seem like someone
I'd be friends with.

132
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,284
- Why not?

133
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,161
- Well, are you close with him?

134
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,497
- He's the only family
I have now.

135
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,626
- How 'bout him and your father,
were they close?

136
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,396
What are they hunting?

137
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,398
- Foxes.

138
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,276
'Til my mother put a stop to it.

139
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,656
- Barrett said he killed
himself.

140
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,204
- In the basement.

141
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,082
He shot himself
through the head with this.

142
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,129
My father suffered from
terrible claustrophobia.

143
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,213
I remember one night my mother
thought it'd be funny

144
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,135
to put him in the harness.

145
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,182
When he woke up, he begged her
for the key but...

146
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,225
She wouldn't give it to him.

147
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,270
He tried to take it
from her so...

148
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,522
She swallowed it.

149
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,324
She used to wear that key
around her neck like a medal.

150
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,163
She was mad.

151
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,213
She was mad.

152
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,469
He went down
into the basement...

153
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,263
And when he came back up
the door was locked.

154
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,474
He couldn't get out and...

155
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,559
With his claustrophobia,

156
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,354
he couldn't stand being down
there for long so...

157
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,607
He shot himself.

158
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,400
- The door closed behind him?

159
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,242
I'm sorry.

160
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,246
You okay?

161
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,537
Olga.

162
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,251
Hello?

163
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,590
Hello?

164
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,487
Hello?

165
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,379
Olga?

166
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,802
Is there someone there?

167
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,908
Is there someone down there?

168
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,712
Jesus!

169
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,001
- Hello?
- Barrett, it's Isaac.

170
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,636
- How'd you get outta the harness?
- I didn't.

171
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,964
- The phone's in her room.

172
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,841
How are you in her room?

173
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:54,968
- Listen to me.

174
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,180
Olga's mother's dead.

175
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,560
Someone shot her and hid her
in the wall in the basement.

176
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,563
Olga's walking around the house
with a fuck in' crossbow.

177
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,023
I need to get outta here.

178
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,194
You still there?

179
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,697
- Where is Olga now?

180
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,575
- She's in her room.

181
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,220
She's in the middle
of one of her fits.

182
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,681
- Does she know you found her mother?
- No.

183
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,915
- Have you called the police?
- Anybody else?

184
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,834
- I don't know where I am.

185
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,770
You need to call 'em
and tell 'em what's happened.

186
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,129
Tell 'em I'm here.

187
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,590
- I'll take care of you.

188
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,304
- Isaac?

189
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,975
 Isaac?

190
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,733
Isaac, can you hear me?

191
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,199
 Isaac.

192
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,794
- I'm trapped in my room.
- I can't open the door.

193
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,881
- I called your uncle.

194
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
He's gonna be here soon.

195
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,261
- What are you talking about?

196
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,976
- I found your mother.

197
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,982
- And you called my uncle.

198
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,904
- He's on his way.

199
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,701
- I didn't kill her.

200
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,369
It was my father and uncle.

201
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,205
Are you listening?

202
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,749
Now my uncle knows
you found her.

203
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,001
Do you think he's gonna
let you leave here?

204
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,879
I have my doubts.

205
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,819
- Leave that by the door
and step back.

206
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,391
Is that true?

207
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,936
Barrett and your father
killed her?

208
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,187
- Yes.

209
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,065
- Were you there?
- No.

210
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,110
No, I found her body, too.
I asked my uncle.

211
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,948
He said it was my father's idea
but that he helped him.

212
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,784
- Why haven't you told someone?

213
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,220
- I didn't want him remembered
as the man

214
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,913
who killed his wife
and hid her body in a wall.

215
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,086
Okay.

216
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,924
Okay, we need to get out of here
before Barrett gets here.

217
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,844
Is there a boat
or any other way off the island?

218
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,136
- No.

219
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,391
- You know where.

220
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,225
Call the police
and tell 'em we need help.

221
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,269
Tell 'em how to get here.

222
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,440
What're you waiting for?

223
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,243
Is there someone there?

224
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,435
- Do you recognize this?

225
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,229
- That's...

226
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,149
My brother Mike
wore a jacket just like that.

227
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,152
- It's the same one.
- You left it here.

228
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,405
- What dyad mean?

229
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,416
- When you were here before,
you took it off.

230
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,201
You left it behind.

231
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,445
- I've never been here before.

232
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,915
- You were.

233
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,541
About a year ago.

234
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,421
- I don't remember that.

235
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,050
What was I doing here?

236
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,426
- Moe sent you.

237
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,512
- For what?

238
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,182
Why did he send me?

239
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,186
- You remember I said my father
shot himself in the basement?

240
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,022
- Yes.

241
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,500
- You remember I said
he only did that

242
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,151
because he was locked
down there?

243
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,903
- You said he was afraid
of small spaces

244
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,446
and the door locked behind him.

245
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,491
- You locked the door.

246
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,409
- What?

247
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,122
- Moe said he couldn't go
through with it, so...

248
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,375
He paid someone
to do it for him.

249
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,585
You.

250
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,254
You lured him down there...

251
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,924
And when he was down there,
you locked the door.

252
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,467
You left him there.

253
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,303
- Barrett told you this?
- Yes.

254
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,323
- He told you he hired me
to come out here

255
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,473
and kill your father?

256
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,226
- He told me you don't
remember any of this.

257
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,396
- I think I'd remember
killing someone.

258
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,231
- But you don't.

259
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,359
- Olga.

260
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,406
Barrett said you've
got some problems.

261
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,409
Maybe you're getting confused.

262
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,495
- I didn't hurt your father.

263
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,497
I've never been here before.

264
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,126
If you would call him...

265
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,294
He'll tell you what
you're saying isn't true.

266
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,088
- No.

267
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,257
- Olga.

268
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,094
Ring your uncle. Please.

269
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,055
Please.

270
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,348
Call him.

271
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,630
Wait a minute! Wait.

272
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,430
- Barrett?
- Yes?

273
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,476
- Hello?
- Barrett.

274
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,311
Barrett, it's Isaac.

275
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,481
Can you hear me?

276
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,566
- Jesus Christ.
- Where's my niece?

277
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,443
- I'm here.

278
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,445
- Barrett.

279
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,615
Olga thinks I did something
to her father.

280
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,492
Okay?

281
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,161
She says I locked him
down in the basement.

282
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,374
She says you told her
I did this...

283
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,669
That I come out here
and locked him down there.

284
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,339
And then he killed himself.

285
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,592
- Yes.

286
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,137
- What do you mean, "yes"?

287
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,183
- That's what you did.
- Who’re you saying this?

288
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,268
- It was a mistake.

289
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,522
I shouldn’t asked.

290
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,108
You shouldn’t said yes.

291
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,818
- I wouldn't do
something like this.

292
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,087
- Before I could call it off,
you had it done.

293
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,488
- I don't know why
you're saying this.

294
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,242
- Olga, take me off speaker.

295
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,290
- I'm sorry. I won't.

296
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,545
He will.

297
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,510
- He's lying.

298
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,346
- You really don't
remember any of this?

299
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,181
- I wouldn't do
something like this.

300
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,683
This never happened.

301
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,463
- Moe says you were a different
person before the accident.

302
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,479
- Call the police.

303
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,357
If I did it,
then they can prove it.

304
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,276
- Moe says you did it.

305
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,403
- Well let me go
and I'll go to the police.

306
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,738
- I can't.

307
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,326
- If something happens
to me here...

308
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,580
If I don't come back...

309
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,249
- Does anyone know you're here?

310
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,714
You want me to sneak into
your brother's house...

311
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,299
And lock him in the basement?

312
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,010
- Yes.

313
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,520
- And then what?

314
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,941
- You come back,
collect your money, and leave.

315
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,911
And what happens to him
down in the basement?

316
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,038
- Well he stays down there.

317
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:52,956
- For how long?

318
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,042
- Well he's claustrophobic.

319
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,519
The stress will probably
kill him

320
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,420
when he realizes
he's trapped down

321
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,057
- This breakdown he's having,

322
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:12,059
he knows things about me.

323
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,937
I can't trust him anymore.

324
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,147
I really can't trust him.

325
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,411
- If you're not interested,
I'll stop talking.

326
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,040
But if you wanna
change your life...

327
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,252
And you think you can do it,
I'll go on.

328
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,422
Shall I go on?

329
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,386
- Go on.

330
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,357
Hello?

331
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,651
Is anyone here?

332
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,263
Hello?

333
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,455
...

334
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,731
Two days. Where've you been?

335
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,525
- Where have I been?

336
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,735
I've been organizing
my brother's funeral.

337
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,797
I've been trying to figure out
what to do about

338
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,572
his mental daughter.

339
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,658
She won't accept
he killed himself.

340
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,661
- So he was dead
when you got there?

341
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,705
- Yes. He was dead.

342
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,793
- What happened after
I called you?

343
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,547
- I went out there...

344
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:27,507
And I found him dead
in the tunnel off the basement

345
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,717
where you said he was.

346
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,803
I notified the police

347
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,555
that my brother had taken
his own life.

348
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,598
They came out,
took the body away,

349
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,975
asked me some questions.

350
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,561
- Who locked the door?

351
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,187
- What?

352
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,565
- The door was already
locked when I got there.

353
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,024
Who locked it?

354
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,485
- The wind must've closed it.

355
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,572
- You need to turn the key
to lock it

356
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,533
was it you?

357
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:55,702
- Why would I lock him in

358
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,704
then come back
and ask you to do it?

359
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,664
That doesn't make any sense.

360
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,715
- What's that?

361
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,091
- It's your money.

362
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:11,968
- I didn't do anything.

363
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,813
I just told you,
the door was already locked

364
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,555
when I got there.

365
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,525
- What's this?

366
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,654
Did you go out there
to warn him?

367
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,492
- Yes.

368
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:36,868
- Why?

369
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,579
Why?

370
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,915
You don't even know him.

371
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,959
What if the police
had seen this?

372
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,545
What would I have said?

373
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,675
Now I want you to take
that money and leave.

374
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,094
And I don't ever
wanna see you again.

375
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,770
Are you gonna tell anyone
what I asked you to do?

376
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,064
- What's there to tell?

377
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,690
What kind of guy

378
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,652
would want to kill
his own brother?

379
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,971
- I don't think you've got over
the shock of seeing ed

380
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,914
down there in that basement.

381
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,667
Now I'm gonna come back
in the morning

382
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,835
when you've had some sleep. 

383
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,963
and we're gonna go
through this again.

384
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,222
...

385
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:04,263
- Olga!

386
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,608
Why's the power off?

387
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,615
What the fuck is happening here?

388
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,578
Why are you wearing that?

389
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,373
- He put me in it.

390
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:34,752
- How'd he get out of it?

391
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,587
- He took her key.

392
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,343
- Where is he now?
- Locked in my room.

393
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,595
I came down to reload.

394
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,311
- You've really made
a mess of this.

395
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,731
I'm starting to think
your mother was right...

396
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,485
And you are a complete
fuck in' idiot!

397
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,489
- None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you.

398
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,661
- You watch how you speak to me.
- Sorry.

399
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,879
-

400
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,687
I'm bleeding.

401
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:02,941
She shot me.

402
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,452
Isaac.

403
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,997
She's gone back upstairs
looking for you.

404
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,753
Come out.

405
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,798
We'll surprise her
when she gets back.

406
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,568
Hurry, Isaac.

407
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,879
 Barrett.

408
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,551
Barrett.

409
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:14,930
Barrett, can you hear me?

410
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:23,730
I'm out.

411
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,017
I'll send someone to get you.
