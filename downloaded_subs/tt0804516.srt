1
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,276
Yes, sir. I redrafted the contracts
to include the new stipulations.

2
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,876
-Then where are they?
-I'm faxing the revisions now.

3
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,511
Did you make all the changes I asked for?

4
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,023
Yes. I included the four percent increase
and the extra 2 million.

5
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,324
No, no. If it's a four percent increase then
you have to add at least 3 million dollars.

6
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,794
That's not what I was told.

7
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,398
-Who told you that?
-Their lawyers.

8
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,369
They're all idiots! I don't understand
this total lack of communication.

9
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,702
It's okay. I just had no way of knowing, sir.

10
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,238
Look, this is what I need you to do.

11
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,709
-Sir, could I put you on hold for a second?
-Okay.

12
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,941
-Thanks. Hi, Jody.
-Mr. Harper wants to see you in his office.

13
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,617
-Great. Of course.
-Still want me to fax those?

14
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,121
You don't have to. I'm not even done yet.
You should go home.

15
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,747
-Are you sure?
-It's late.

16
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,792
I don't want your parents to worry.
Get out of here.

17
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,352
-Okay. Merry Christmas, Angela.
-Merry Christmas, Jody.

18
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,667
Hi, Lorraine. Of course I'm going to make it.

19
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,109
Just let me call you back. Okay?

20
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,949
In a few minutes, I promise. Okay.

21
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,647
Still on the Morgan deal?

22
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,613
What can I do for you, Jim?

23
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,653
I...

24
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,094
I don't know how to...

25
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,796
Angela, I feel terrible about what happened.

26
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,399
It's fine. Let's just not worry about it, okay?

27
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,838
No, it's not okay. I acted like a real jerk.

28
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:09,311
I had too many drinks and... You know
how these Christmas parties can be.

29
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,211
We had a baby last year, and...

30
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,017
It's been a hard year.

31
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,457
I'm sure that it has.

32
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,858
I simply want to tell you
that I'm really, really sorry. Okay?

33
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,161
Apology accepted.

34
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,228
Thanks. Merry Christmas, Angela.

35
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,999
You too, Jim.

36
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,043
You calling me from work?
Thought you were going home first.

37
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,916
-I brought everything with me. Don't worry.
Get over here, Angie.

38
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,015
God, I am
so late with this dinner.

39
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,686
Did you pick up the Santa Claus costume?
I hope you didn't forget it.

40
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,662
It's in the car.

41
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,257
I think Dad is more excited than the kids.

42
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,830
I can't wait to get out of here
and see you guys.

43
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,167
Jimmy, put that back.
We're having dinner soon.

44
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,469
-You want Santa to come tonight or not?
Mommy, I want Santa to come.

45
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,567
Then help me set the table.

46
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,943
-Please don't be late.
-I won't. I promise.

47
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,675
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

48
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,247
Okay.

49
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,721
-Oh, Jesus!
-My God!

50
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,262
-Sorry, Angela...
-It's okay.

51
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,030
I was just locking up the floors.
I didn't know anybody would be working

52
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,765
this late on Christmas Eve.

53
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,670
-Me neither.
-Sorry.

54
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,800
I'll come back later, all right?

55
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,640
Actually, if you wouldn't
mind waiting, I'll lock my office

56
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,976
-and take the elevator down with you.
-Sure.

57
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,345
Two seconds.

58
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:25,977
Do you work all night?

59
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,215
Yeah, but they're closing the building
for the next three days.

60
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,980
-Besides, I get New Year's Eve off.
-That's good.

61
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,323
I hope to get home in time
for the girls to open up the presents.

62
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,556
-How are they?
-Great.

63
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,728
-Your parents can't stand me.
-You're wrong. They love you.

64
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:46,260
-So, where are you going this evening?
-I'm going to my sister's house in Jersey.

65
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,672
I thought of you more as
an Upper East Side girl.

66
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,708
Upper east side of Maine, actually.
I grew up on a farm.

67
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,347
Now, I'm having trouble believing that.

68
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,148
Hey, don't let the fancy clothes fool you.
I keep it real.

69
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,748
Is that what you call it? Keeping it real?

70
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,017
-Goodnight, Karl.
-Merry Christmas, Angela.

71
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,618
You too. I'll see you soon.

72
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,372
I promise you I'm leaving right now.

73
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,639
I know. I'm sorry, but I'm in the elevator.

74
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,708
Twenty-five minutes, tops.

75
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,277
I can't hear you. What?
Lorraine, you're breaking up.

76
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,682
Hello?

77
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,578
You have got to be kidding.

78
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,022
Come on.

79
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,527
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

80
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,540
I'm getting out of the car
is what I'm gonna do.

81
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,231
Oh, shit.

82
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,281
Hello?

83
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,548
Jesus!

84
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,790
Rocky, what are you doing? Heel.

85
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,830
Stay. Down.

86
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,434
-Sorry about that.
-It's okay.

87
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,703
Look, can you unlock the door
to the elevator room?

88
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,071
My car won't start, and I need to
get upstairs and get a cab.

89
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:14,238
Yeah, I can.
I've just got to find my key cards.

90
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:18,916
Sorry. Where are those darn keys?
I'm about to do my rounds anyway, so...

91
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,579
-Okay, great.
-What happened to your car?

92
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,851
-I have no idea.
-You probably left the lights on.

93
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,791
I don't think so. I'm usually pretty good
about that kind of thing.

94
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:32,261
People do it all the time. It's instinctive.
You drive down here, it's dark... It happens.

95
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,323
Here we go.

96
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,459
-Great.
-You know, actually...

97
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,767
I have a charger in the back, so if it is
your battery probably you could use that.

98
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,701
Thank you, but... I really should
just take a cab. I'm so late as it is.

99
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,578
No, no. It would probably take longer
to get a cab. It's Christmas Eve.

100
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,508
So... I don't know. Up to you.
Whatever you want.

101
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,482
-How long will it take?
-Just a few minutes.

102
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,620
Now with beautiful Metropolitan
Opera House in the background,

103
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,531
let's check out
the temperatures in the Tri-State Area.

104
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,304
-Which way to your car?
-Over there.

105
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,531
Okay.

106
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,544
Working late, huh? I know how you feel.

107
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:25,106
These are pretty reliable cars
for the most part, right?

108
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,313
They're supposed to be.

109
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,784
All right. Positive...

110
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,554
Negative.

111
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,030
-All right, try it. Turn her over.
-Okay.

112
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,396
Strange.

113
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,097
Hang on. Can you turn your headlights on?

114
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,269
Weird. Try turning the keys again.

115
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,973
-Damn it.
-All right. I guess turn the headlights off.

116
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,378
You know what?

117
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,718
That's it.
You've been a great help, but I give up.

118
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,853
Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I thought I could do something.

119
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:14,458
You've been great. Could you just
let me in the elevator room now?

120
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,190
I was just trying to help.

121
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,770
I know. And I appreciate it. Thank you.

122
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,448
Hey, I know you're upset
about your car not starting, but...

123
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,519
It's the holidays. It's time to be thankful.

124
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,512
You know what? You're right.

125
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,182
-Yeah?
-I should be thankful.

126
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,597
I, uh...

127
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,998
I prepared
a small Christmas meal for myself.

128
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,535
You could join me if you want.

129
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,009
-I'm just kidding.
-Oh, sorry. I'm exhausted.

130
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,045
But thanks for your help.

131
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,017
You're welcome. Maybe some other time?

132
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,122
Sure.

133
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,220
All right.

134
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,390
Here you go. You sure
you don't want me to call you a cab?

135
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,727
-No. I've got a number in my bag.
-Suit yourself. Merry Christmas.

136
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,992
Merry Christmas.

137
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,411
Karl?

138
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,840
Hi. Can I get a car
at 2370 Park Avenue, please?

139
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,548
Are you sure? No, that's okay.
I'll wait. Thanks.

140
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:28,690
Lorraine, you won't believe what happened.
No, my car wouldn't start.

141
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:34,766
Just start without me, and I'll be there
within the hour and I'll make it up to them.

142
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,942
Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye.

143
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,460
Hello? Oh, great. Thank you!

144
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,537
Okay. Okay.

145
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,972
Oh, come on.

146
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,471
What?

147
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:58,721
This is not happening. Is this a joke?
God, no, you gotta be kidding me.

148
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,154
Karl? Where are you? Is anybody here?

149
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,128
Come on, come on, come on.

150
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,071
What?

151
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,206
One second, okay? I'll be right back.
Just one second.

152
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,330
Hello, can you hear me?

153
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,495
I've got a cab waiting for me.
Can you open the front gate, please?

154
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,465
Hello?

155
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,701
No... Wait!

156
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,316
No! Damn it!
Why would you leave me here?

157
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,785
Wake up! The cab just left.

158
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,443
Hey! I'm still in here! Wait!

159
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,692
Great.

160
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,971
It's okay.

161
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,483
Hello?

162
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,684
Stop being paranoid.

163
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,964
Go down to the office.

164
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,234
Hello?

165
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,116
Oh, fuck!

166
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,872
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
You've been a good little girl.

167
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,549
Wait. It's okay. You're all right. Okay?

168
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,851
All right?

169
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:05,560
You're not looking so good. Are you okay?
Take it easy. It's okay.

170
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:14,437
-What happened to me? What time is it?
-You just fell. You'll be all right.

171
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,101
I don't feel good. I'm going to be sick.

172
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,706
I'll get you some water.

173
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:28,413
Be careful! You're gonna hurt yourself.
Try to stay calm.

174
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,288
Okay.

175
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,323
It's okay. Here. Okay?

176
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,466
I'm going to help you up, okay?

177
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,169
Here we go.

178
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,069
There you go. It's okay.

179
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,913
All right. Try to relax while I clean this up.

180
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,609
Okay.

181
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,986
Clean this up. Okay.

182
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,594
All right. I'll be right back.

183
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,783
Hungry? I've got turkey,

184
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,756
mashed potatoes, cranberries,
and I've even got some cornbread.

185
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,633
Oh, man. I'm sorry about this.
I was just teasing.

186
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,662
I didn't mean to scare you.

187
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,402
I hope it's still warm.

188
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,878
If not, I have a microwave.

189
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,655
Are you feeling any better?

190
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,588
What happened to my clothes?

191
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,356
Like I said, you fell
and your clothes got dirty...

192
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,338
Maybe you'd like some wine.

193
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,109
Help you relax a little bit, you know?

194
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,579
I don't know what you're doing,
but you'd better just fucking untie me.

195
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,119
This is a California wine.

196
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,749
It's Sonoma County. That's where I'm from.

197
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,423
It's beautiful up there.

198
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,522
Where are you from?

199
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,668
-What do you want?
-I want to know where you're from.

200
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,705
I'm from Readfield.

201
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:12,445
-Readfield. Where's that?
-Please, tell me what you want.

202
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:18,614
I just want to know where Readfield is.
And I want you to relax.

203
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,836
Cheers.

204
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,438
I'll make a toast.
Here's to good friends and hometowns

205
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,640
and Readfield. Wherever that is.

206
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,582
-Listen...
-Tom.

207
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,853
Tom.

208
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,862
I have someplace to be. I have obligations.

209
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,063
Yeah. I know. Way too many.

210
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:11,002
You need time for yourself. You don't need
to be at everyone's beck and call.

211
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,771
Then maybe we should
get a drink in the new year.

212
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:25,017
I've already prepared everything.
It's all here.

213
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,791
I know, and it looks really good.

214
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,484
Yeah? Great. Well, let's eat.

215
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,296
I'm starving.

216
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,300
Tom, this is really sweet of you,
and I mean that.

217
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,859
But my whole family is expecting me.
I have plans.

218
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,132
I guess some plans are made to be broken.

219
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,174
Do you want to say grace or should I?

220
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:54,614
Hell, let's skip it.
I've never been religious anyway.

221
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,484
Bon appétit.

222
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,822
What do you like to do?

223
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,169
After work and stuff? I guess, hobbies.

224
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,103
That's a mundane question,
but I guess people ask that

225
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,575
just to get to know each other, right?

226
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:24,581
I read. Right now I'm reading Hemingway,
The Sun Also Rises.

227
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:30,417
And you really should eat.
It's gonna get cold.

228
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:36,621
Anyway, in the book
this guy loves this girl so much

229
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:41,193
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

230
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,434
Even her infidelities.

231
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,165
That's a pretty intense story, but...

232
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,102
That's what love is supposed to be, right?

233
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,316
My boyfriend is gonna get worried
and come looking for me, Tom.

234
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,798
If I don't show up,
he'll come looking for me.

235
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,332
He knows where I work.

236
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,339
How long have you guys been
dating or hanging out?

237
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,709
-Two years.
-Two years?

238
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,877
-Do you live together?
-That's none of your fucking business.

239
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,251
That's not very nice dinner talk.

240
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,450
Yeah, we live together, okay?

241
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,696
Two years...

242
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:54,401
That's more than a boyfriend.
That sounds like wedding bells.

243
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,531
Do you have any plans?

244
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:01,343
-Yes.
-What does your fiancé do?

245
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,842
He's a journalist.

246
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:07,646
I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist?

247
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,119
-Sports.
-What paper?

248
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,322
-Post.
-I read The Post.

249
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,620
-What's his name?
-Mark Clayton.

250
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,754
Clayton. I don't remember that name.

251
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:25,861
-I have one over here.
-It's The Post online.

252
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,807
It's amazing

253
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,112
that you're able to keep a relationship
with the amount of hours you work.

254
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,554
He must get really lonely
when you have to work late, right?

255
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,758
Do you love him?

256
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,754
Does he love you?

257
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:02,731
I'm only asking because I'm worried about
how quickly he's going to get here.

258
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,707
I'm sure he's already on his way.

259
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:15,352
Right. He's probably
on the Harlem River Drive as we speak.

260
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,650
-What kind of car does he drive?
-I don't know.

261
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,883
You don't know what kind of car
your fiancé drives?

262
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:24,395
-Toyota, I think.
-Toyota. That is a fast car.

263
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,530
He can be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

264
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,124
He could be coming down
this ramp right now.

265
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:44,079
You haven't been very talkative
since we met.

266
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:50,779
But now you're telling me all about

267
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,517
your boyfriend. Oh, sorry, your fiancé.

268
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:02,290
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

269
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,199
I'm guessing

270
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,794
you're lying to me.

271
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,741
You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?

272
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,305
But you want one.

273
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,783
You want somebody who cares about you...

274
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,118
-Worries about you...
-Please, don't.

275
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,526
You've got a great family.

276
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,522
You've got Lorraine.

277
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,927
Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

278
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,167
They're probably getting worried about you.

279
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,402
Maybe we should give them a call. Yeah?

280
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,309
Tell them you're okay.

281
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,179
What do you think?

282
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,598
What should we say?

283
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,208
I know.
We should say you made other plans.

284
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,405
No. You probably already said that one.

285
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,875
You know what?
You should think of something.

286
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,741
You're a good liar.

287
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,853
Go ahead.

288
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,151
Go!

289
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,019
No.

290
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,470
Hello? Hello?

291
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,241
Hey, Rosie.
Can you get your mommy on the phone?

292
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,973
Who's calling, please?

293
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,381
-It's Auntie Angie.
-Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.

294
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,549
Give me a second, okay?
Hey, where are you?

295
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,220
-Angela?
-I'm not feeling well.

296
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,122
What do you mean?
We're all waiting for you.

297
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,889
She says she's not feeling well.

298
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:20,028
That's what she said the last time.
Can I talk to my sister, please?

299
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,468
Where are you, Angie?

300
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,507
She's got a real job. It's not like...

301
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,535
Angela?

302
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,645
I went home.

303
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,840
What's wrong? Where is she?

304
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,907
I don't understand.
Last time I talked to you,

305
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,783
you were on your way.
What about the costume?

306
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,880
Let's just eat.
You should know your sister by now.

307
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,452
It would be nice if you'd try

308
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,391
and put your family
ahead of your work sometimes.

309
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,325
That's enough. Give me the phone.

310
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,458
Angie, what's wrong?

311
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,061
Hello? I can't hear her.

312
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,028
Sweetie? Can you hear me?

313
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,266
-Hi, Mom. I'm here.
-Honey, what happened? Where are you?

314
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,810
I don't know.

315
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,075
I think it's the flu.

316
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,210
You really sound terrible.
Are you sure you're okay?

317
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,587
Yeah. I just need some rest.

318
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,983
Okay.

319
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,997
Rest up and hopefully you'll
feel better for lunch tomorrow.

320
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,998
And don't worry about the costume, okay?

321
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,662
-Merry Christmas, angel. I love you.
-I love you too, Mom.

322
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,954
That was the best Christmas present
anyone's ever given me.

323
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,484
Thank you.

324
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,291
And now I have a present for you.

325
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,913
Go ahead.

326
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,479
Open it.

327
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,189
Aren't you even curious?

328
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,958
Open it.

329
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,700
Yes.

330
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,270
Bet you're curious now.

331
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,944
Okay. Enough torture.

332
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,019
Watch. It's all cued up.

333
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,791
-Why are you showing this to me?
-Wait.

334
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,088
You fucked up now, asshole.

335
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,498
Sorry you had to see that.

336
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,500
You want to go for a stroll?

337
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,611
These guys always do whatever they want.

338
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,455
Here we go.

339
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,331
Rocky, sit down!

340
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,445
Why did you do that?

341
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,955
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

342
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,150
-Let me help you up.
-Don't.

343
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,958
-Don't touch me!
-I'm not gonna hurt you. All right?

344
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,055
You're hurting my arm.

345
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,657
That's because you won't
relax your arms. Okay?

346
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,670
-Come on.
-Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

347
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,142
Yeah, I believe you.
I just need to show you something.

348
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,053
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

349
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,426
Here we go.

350
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,046
Uh-oh.

351
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,484
I think I drank too much wine.

352
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,982
I really shouldn't be driving.

353
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,958
I'm just kidding.

354
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,332
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

355
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,095
Strange being in the car with you.

356
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,564
It's great, actually.

357
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,035
-I thought you said we were taking a drive.
-We are.

358
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,105
Then why are we going down, Tom?

359
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,047
It's freezing out there.

360
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:11,280
Besides, this is gonna be much better.

361
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,597
Why are we down here, Thomas?

362
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,228
Tom?

363
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,515
Oh, my God, Tom.

364
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,423
What is this?

365
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,091
This is my present to you.

366
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,308
I want you to take this and show him.

367
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,138
Show him what?

368
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,444
Show him you're not a slut.

369
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:19,779
Take this and teach him he can't be
touching every woman he wants.

370
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,086
Are you talking about
what happened in the elevator?

371
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:29,030
Oh, Tom, no. You don't understand.
That was a mistake.

372
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,027
A stupid mistake.

373
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,570
-What? He tried to rape you.
-No.

374
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,741
He got a little out of hand at a party, Tom.
He hardly tried to rape me.

375
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:41,574
Look, he was drunk. He apologized.

376
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,773
Oh, he apologized.

377
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,951
You think you're the first woman
he tried to do this to?

378
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,543
I've seen him try to touch
every woman in the building.

379
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,022
-He's a pervert. A degenerate.
-No.

380
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,393
He's a good man, Tom.

381
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:02,595
Look at him. He has a family.
He has a wife. Tom, please don't.

382
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,863
Tom, Tom...
Stop calling out my name, all right?

383
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,494
I know what you're trying to do.

384
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,096
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victim.

385
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,974
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you!
All right?

386
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,376
Stop calling out my name!
Enough's enough!

387
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,382
Tom, Tom, Tom!
How many times can you say it?

388
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,210
Okay.

389
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,629
I know you're a person, okay?

390
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,763
I'm a person, too.

391
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,635
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

392
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,272
I care about your feelings.

393
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:49,135
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

394
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,715
So if you want to help him,

395
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,345
take this and teach him a lesson.

396
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,153
I told you, he apologized.

397
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,731
What? He can just apologize
and then he can do it again?

398
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,665
And then he's just gonna
apologize again and then...

399
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,067
You've got to stop letting these assholes
have their way with you!

400
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:19,007
Tom, please believe me.
It was just a misunderstanding, Tom.

401
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:23,570
Tom, Tom!
Just stop calling out my name! I told you!

402
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,507
-Didn't I?
-Yes! Yes.

403
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,646
-I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
-Jesus! When are you gonna understand?

404
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,051
I'm here to help you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

405
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,039
Okay.

406
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,142
I'll do it.

407
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,318
You untie me and I'll do it.

408
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,462
No. Oh, no. Whoa.

409
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,156
You're a good person.

410
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,463
You're a good person, too.

411
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,299
I should have never asked
you to do this. I'm sorry.

412
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:25,331
No. It's okay because I want to.

413
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:30,142
You just have to untie me
and I'll do it for you.

414
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,882
No, no. It's my job to protect you.

415
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,828
No, Tom, listen to me. It's not.
Please don't do anything.

416
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,956
Don't try to run away, okay?

417
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,431
Can I trust you?

418
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,498
-Can I trust you?
-Yes.

419
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,335
You can trust me.

420
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:06,043
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry.

421
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,445
So...

422
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,987
You like to touch girls, do you?

423
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,559
No? Look at her.

424
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,056
I said look at her.

425
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,027
Does she look happy to you? Huh?

426
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,698
Yeah.

427
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,969
You messed with the wrong girl.

428
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,975
What makes you think
you deserve her? Huh?

429
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,344
What gives you the right?

430
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,884
You're something else, you know that?

431
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,550
You pretentious Ivy League piece of shit.

432
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,218
You don't own the world and everyone in it.

433
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,790
What is a guy like you thinking
when he puts his hands all over a girl

434
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:59,927
who obviously is not interested?
Who is obviously not a slut?

435
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,232
Because that's what
you think they are, right?

436
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,005
Yeah? I can't hear you. What did you say?

437
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,876
What? Can you speak up?

438
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:14,679
Because you can't talk your way
out of this one, can you?

439
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,478
-Why am I even wasting my time with you?
No!

440
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,355
-What? Angela, he deserves it!
-Don't do anything, Thomas, please!

441
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:41,936
No!

442
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,480
Stop it! Stop it!

443
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,730
Way to ruin Christmas, asshole.

444
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,979
Well, he won't be bothering you again.

445
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,020
Where are we going?

446
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,885
We can't just leave him here.
You have to get him.

447
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,154
What? Why are you defending him?

448
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,699
I'm not. I'm not.

449
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,362
Do you like this?
Do you like to get touched?

450
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,462
You like it when he touches you
in the parking garage?

451
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,133
-Do you want to get laid here?
-You know that's not true.

452
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,645
So what is it? A career thing?

453
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,413
Did you fuck him to get a promotion?

454
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,543
We can't leave him here.

455
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,082
You're right. I'm sorry.

456
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,753
We shouldn't leave him here.

457
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,330
Wait! Thomas, stop!

458
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:17,364
-What are you doing?
-We're gonna just take him for a little drive.

459
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:22,007
What are you doing?
Tom, stop the car! Please!

460
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,307
Please stop! Please!

461
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,883
Stop it! What are you doing, Tom? No!

462
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,250
No! No!

463
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,851
Oh, my God!

464
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:43,497
No, please! Oh, my God! Don't do this.

465
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,702
Please don't! No!

466
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,172
Thomas, no.

467
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,613
You're a good person, Thomas.
Please don't do this.

468
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:06,219
No! God, no! Stop it!

469
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,422
Hey! Hey!

470
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,523
Where are you going?

471
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,036
Angela! Come back!

472
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,640
You fucked him, didn't you? Liar!

473
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,901
Hey! Down here!

474
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,366
Can you hear me? Help!

475
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,313
Down here! Can't you hear me?

476
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,066
Good boy.

477
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,818
Sit. Good boy.

478
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,722
Stay right there, Rocky.

479
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,782
Stay there.

480
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:01,282
Help me! Help me, please!

481
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:10,199
Help me, please!
Someone's trying to kill me! Help me!

482
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,601
Help me!

483
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:18,172
Somebody's trying to kill me!

484
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,534
Oh, Karl. Where are you?

485
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,005
Oh, my God.

486
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,206
Angela?

487
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,678
Please.
If anyone can hear me...

488
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,541
I'm trapped in the underground parking
structure of the Arcadia Building.

489
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,108
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

490
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:37,713
Someone's trying to kill me.

491
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,084
Angela.

492
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,149
Angela, come out.

493
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,492
Shit.

494
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,560
Angela?

495
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,530
Can we talk about this?

496
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,211
Looks like somebody's
playing games, huh, Rocky?

497
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,915
Angela?

498
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:16,713
Come on.

499
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,292
Come on. Lobby.
Come on. Lobby. Come on.

500
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,460
Why is it fucking locked?

501
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,694
Angela!

502
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,104
Hello?

503
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,008
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

504
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,073
Please, hello?

505
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,876
Answer, please?

506
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,116
Yes?
Five Brothers Security here. Hello?

507
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,991
Yes. I'm here. Can you hear me?

508
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,658
I can hear you fine. How can I help you?

509
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,186
I'm being kidnapped.
I work at Brieter, Smith and Steinberg.

510
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,926
It's 2370 Park Avenue

511
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,332
and I'm hiding in the elevator.
Please can you call 911?

512
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,633
Calm down, miss.
Is there someone with you right now?

513
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:47,067
No, he's outside in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

514
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,605
Did you see him do it?

515
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:52,011
Yes! His name is Thomas and he's
the parking attendant in my building.

516
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,312
If you'll just please hurry. I'm in danger.

517
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:57,410
Ma'am, you have got to relax
and take a deep breath.

518
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,785
How do you fucking expect me to relax?
This man is trying to kill me!

519
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,223
Can you please try to understand
and call the cops?

520
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,319
Please just call 911!

521
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,593
The police?

522
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:15,160
No. I'm sure he's just trying to help you.

523
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,700
Right?

524
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,168
Angela?

525
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,344
Are you still there?

526
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,546
Listen you fuck-face, I called the cops
and I'm gonna stay down here

527
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,556
as long as it takes until they get here,
so I suggest that you get the fuck out!

528
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,153
I just wanna talk to you.

529
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,490
That's why I pretended to be
someone else, okay? So don't be upset.

530
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,292
Will you come out? I was just kidding.

531
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,960
Just go to hell!

532
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,772
Don't you understand? I did it for you.
That guy showed you no respect.

533
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,639
Why won't you talk to me, Angela?

534
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,076
Just give me a chance.

535
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:07,022
If you just give us a chance,
it can work out.

536
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,824
You'll grow to like me.

537
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,458
That's usually what happens
when two people

538
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,896
are forced to be together
in a stressful situation.

539
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:20,561
They have to depend on one another.
And eventually they support each other.

540
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:24,571
They like each other.
Sometimes they even fall in love.

541
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:29,472
Angela.

542
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:34,074
Please don't do this.

543
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,221
Why won't you talk to me?

544
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:47,153
You know, I wish you had just
a little bit more respect for yourself.

545
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,393
I'm not coming out! Do you hear me?

546
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,633
I'm not fucking moving, you fuck!

547
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,489
Karl! Oh, no, please.

548
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:58,949
Karl!

549
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,816
Come on, Karl!

550
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,086
Angela?

551
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,862
You must be freezing out here.

552
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,327
Angela.

553
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,579
What a mess.

554
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,014
Angela.

555
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,122
I think Karl is hurt.

556
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:15,927
Angela? Should we call him an ambulance?

557
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:23,770
That way he can go back to his kids
and family, and you can go to your sister's.

558
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,598
And I could stay here! In this parking lot!

559
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,904
All by myself!

560
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:33,239
Because that's obviously
what everybody wants!

561
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,948
Angela?

562
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,855
I just can't keep
chasing you around all night.

563
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:54,326
Besides, the whole place is locked.

564
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,672
Angela?

565
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:03,608
Where are you gonna go if you get away?

566
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,245
It's freezing out there.

567
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,412
You can't go out.

568
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,285
Angela?

569
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,482
Angela!

570
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,359
Angela?

571
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,743
Way to ruin Christmas, Karl.

572
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,975
I'll have a blue

573
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:16,441
Christmas without you

574
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:22,414
I'll be so blue

575
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:27,456
Just thinking about you

576
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:34,463
Decorations of red

577
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:38,997
On a green Christmas tree

578
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,707
Won't be the same, dear

579
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:49,112
If you're not here with me

580
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:53,185
And when those blue

581
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:58,120
Snowflakes start falling

582
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:03,028
That's when those blue

583
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,959
Memories start calling

584
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:14,904
You'll be doing all right

585
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:20,008
With your Christmas of white

586
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:25,277
But I'll have a blue

587
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,647
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

588
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,980
You'll be doing all right

589
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:59,785
With your Christmas of white

590
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:05,090
But I'll have a blue

591
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,258
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

592
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,857
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

593
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,500
Oh, yeah.

594
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,183
Do you want makeup?

595
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,318
Okay.

596
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,562
You have the most beautiful lips

597
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,639
I have ever seen in my life.

598
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,935
You're beautiful.

599
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,875
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

600
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,713
You have a wonderful body.

601
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,525
It was meant to be, babe.

602
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:51,364
Me and you.

603
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,299
Your skin...

604
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,007
It's soft.

605
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,605
Honey.

606
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:09,413
I love you. Angela, you know that, right?

607
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,498
Hello?

608
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:31,962
Shit.

609
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,737
I'm down here. Hello? Can you hear me?

610
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:41,843
It's okay.

611
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,503
Hello, Officer. Can I help you?

612
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,845
Can you open up the gate, please?

613
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,946
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

614
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,227
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

615
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,615
Hey.

616
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:59,456
Sorry about that.
I was on the bottom floor doing my rounds.

617
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,628
What's going on tonight?

618
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,934
We got a call about a disturbance
at this address. Know anything about that?

619
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,474
No, it's been real quiet all night.

620
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,836
See anything, hear anything suspicious?

621
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,277
Like I said, I was just doing my rounds.

622
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,583
It's been really quiet.
I haven't seen anybody down here.

623
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,017
Any cars in there?

624
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,847
Well, it is a parking garage.

625
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:33,828
There's a few cars scattered
over here in this level.

626
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,592
On the second level there's a rental thing.

627
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,828
Like I said, there's been no one
around tonight. Except me and Rocky.

628
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,803
Two of you working here tonight.

629
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:47,001
Kind of. He's my dog.
He's down in the office right now.

630
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,776
We're gonna take a look around.
Get in the back. We'll give you a ride.

631
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:52,143
That's a great idea.

632
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:58,250
I've just gotta close this gate.
A lot of homeless people around here.

633
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,753
Thanks for the ride.

634
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,598
If you guys wanna
check out the other floors,

635
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:48,330
just keep going around this way.

636
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:51,202
But be careful on P3.
There's a broken water main, okay?

637
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:53,537
-We'll come back around.
-Okay.

638
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,235
What the hell's going on here, man?

639
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:52,392
Help me! Help!

640
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,612
Help me! Help!

641
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,968
Help me!

642
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:41,435
Sure you haven't seen
anything weird tonight?

643
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,707
No. Everybody left really early tonight.

644
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,211
You having a party in here?

645
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,876
No, no. It's just me and Rocky, not a party.

646
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,989
Got anybody coming over to visit?
You know, a little action?

647
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,621
Me? No. The company would fire me
if I had anyone down here tonight.

648
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:04,396
Especially at this hour.

649
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,765
Well, we don't want to break any rules.
Right, partner?

650
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,998
Not on my watch.

651
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,629
Come on, let's go.

652
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,444
Help me!

653
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,746
Help me!

654
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:24,316
I've got to open the gate,
so I'll just take the stairs.

655
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,081
Let's do it.

656
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,470
Open.

657
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,385
Wait!

658
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:17,437
You guys stay warm.

659
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:21,205
-You keep your eyes and ears open, huh?
-You bet.

660
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,548
-Merry Christmas.
-You too, buddy.

661
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:38,954
Wait! Wait!

662
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:47,109
911.

663
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,582
-Yes, please, I need your help.
-All our lines are busy at the moment.

664
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:50,640
Please hold.

665
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,846
-Someone will be with you shortly.
-Hello?

666
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,252
Thank you.

667
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,014
All our lines are busy at the moment.
Please hold.

668
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:36,120
911. All our lines are busy at the moment.

669
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,635
Rock? Rocky!

670
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:02,490
Why would you do that?

671
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,290
He's just an animal.

672
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,663
Angela!

673
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,331
Why would you kill a defenseless animal?

674
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:30,916
After all I did for you? To help you?

675
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,416
This is what I get?

676
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,891
You killed my dog!

677
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,195
Answer. Please answer.

678
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,723
Angela?

679
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:47,157
You're really starting to piss me off!

680
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:48,562
Angela!

681
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:40,351
Hello? Are you there?

682
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:43,715
Hello? This is the police.
Is somebody there?

683
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:49,153
Is this an emergency?
If you can hear me, please say something.

684
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:53,030
Tap the phone, let me know
if you're there. Hello?

685
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:59,505
This is the police. This is 911.
Are you okay? Are you there? Hello?

686
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:07,245
You're trying to get me fired, aren't you?

687
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:12,243
Bet you'd really like that.

688
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,528
But, honey...

689
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,704
What are we gonna do then?

690
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,470
We couldn't just live off of your salary.

691
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,469
Angela!

692
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,041

01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,147
Angela!

694
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,844
Shit!

695
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:49,895
Shit!

696
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,904
Let's fucking do this.
You want to fuck with me?

697
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:08,410
Come on!

698
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,426
Come on, you chicken shit!

699
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,330
Angela?

700
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,698
Let me help you out, okay?

701
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:57,352
Help me? You're gonna help me?

702
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:01,156
Why don't you let me help you,
for a change? Motherfucker!

703
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,251
What the fuck are you doing, Angela?

704
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,123
Come back here, now! Let me go!

705
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,529
Come over here
and get me out of this right now!

706
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:47,571
Why are you doing this, Angela?

707
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:50,738
Angela.

708
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:56,807
Angela? I just wanted us to be friends.

709
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,749
I'm alone.

710
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:03,815
I'm always alone.

711
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:09,790
Why can't we just
spend more time together?

712
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,893
Angela? Wait.

713
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:17,368
Why?

714
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,634
Why can't we be friends?

715
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:25,077
Why can't we just
spend Christmas together?

716
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:29,044
Do you hear me? You stupid, fucking cunt!

717
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:44,054
Angela, wait. I didn't...

718
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:46,528
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

719
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:53,606
No! No! No!

720
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,234
No! No!

721
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:56,057
You all right, lady?

722
