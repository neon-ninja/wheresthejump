00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,881
Let me the fuck in!

3
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:48,883
Get... Get up!

4
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:50,283
Let me in!

5
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:56,357
Brother, are you seeing this?

6
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,694
There's a riot
on every fucking floor.

7
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:04,732
Look, you don't want
to feed them, fine.

8
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:07,468
Don't need to no more,
'cause I did it.

9
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,605
I found a buyer... 500K.

10
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,172
This is the time, man.

11
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,908
- Buyer won't wait.
- Oh, man.

12
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,177
This high...

13
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:28,623
Let's talk on the balcony.

14
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:43,138
You've done fine work, Roadie.

15
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:45,940
Is it real?

16
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,442
Yeah, sure as shit.

17
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:51,848
It all goes down tomorrow
at dawn, 18 hours.

18
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,259
Great.

19
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:07,162
Unload everything.

20
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,498
I'm gonna blow this town.

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,200
On it.

22
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:38,193
Did you follow me down here?

23
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,933
Is this what you want?

24
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,577
So?

25
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:59,747
Go on... if you really want it.

26
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,710
I'm not saying I condone

27
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:04,678
a militia mentality here
or anything like that,

28
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,014
but I'm saying people need to
take this into their own hands.

29
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,649
The cops can't do anything
anymore.

30
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,784
There's not enough of them.

31
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:23,898
They're taking care
of themselves.

32
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,865
They're killing each other.

33
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,700
We don't need to go in there
and do anything.

34
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,035
I'm not gonna risk my life.

35
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,881
I drive down the street,
yes, I see less homeless people.

36
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,082
Maybe there's more crime
around there,

37
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:43,918
but the crime's gonna be gone.

38
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,900
Baby's still running, huh?

39
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,002
Better than you are.

40
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,805
Whoa, man.

41
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,006
A little early for that,
ain't it?

42
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:07,541
Starting the day off right,
baby.

43
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:08,843
I guess so.

44
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:10,644
Let the good times roll, huh?

45
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,484
God!

46
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:19,520
It's depressing looking
at the old neighborhood, though.

47
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:20,421
It's depressing.

48
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,423
This used to be
almost a thriving place.

49
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:23,691
It's too bad it's going down.

50
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,527
It's turning into
a fucking war zone, man.

51
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:29,463
I'll tell you what it is.
It's all those goddamn drugs.

52
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,098
Say, about your truck, man...

53
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,801
It's old,
but it's still running, right?

54
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:35,903
At the moment.
Don't fucking...

55
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:37,137
Don't... Don't say anything.

56
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,206
It's old,
but it's still running, dude.

57
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,642
Just like us...
old but still running.

58
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,221
- See this?
- Yeah, I see it. What's...

59
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,624
There's a bunch of punks
who have been hanging out there.

60
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:57,992
Yeah.

61
00:06:57,994 --> 00:07:00,027
I started noticing
about two weeks ago,

62
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,862
and there was just a couple
of them.

63
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,530
- And now there's more and more.
- Druggies?

64
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:04,565
I don't know what the fuck...

65
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,700
Yeah, I'd say
they're drug addicts, for sure.

66
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:08,802
There's a whole shitload
of them, too.

67
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,474
But as long as they keep
over there...

68
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,876
- Guess what, man.
- What?

69
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,245
Birthday boy!

70
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:21,081
- Fuck you.
- No, no. Birthday boy.

71
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,517
Don't say nothing
about it, all right?

72
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,085
I'm not the only one
who knows that.

73
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,056
You think the other guys
don't know that?

74
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,880
God! Shit!

75
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:52,646
Oh, great.
We're here.

76
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,127
I had a dream, Fred.

77
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,531
You hit every goddamn pothole
in town.

78
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,901
That was no dream.

79
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,769
Oh, it was delib'ate, wasn't it?

80
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,137
"Delib'ate"?
Where you from?

81
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,751
Walter, hit the lights.

82
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:33,055
Yep.
Got it.

83
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,162
There you go.

84
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,663
Son of a motherfucking whore.

85
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:50,664
Uh-huh.

86
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,067
This piece of shit's
on its last legs, Fred.

87
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:55,938
Hey, Walter.
Walter, settle down, huh?

88
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,375
Oh! Come on. Be gentle, man.

89
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:02,643
I brought this all the way
from Bloody Ridge.

90
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,079
Aw, one man and a big damn knife

91
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:07,382
holding back
the Communist regime, huh?

92
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,116
You used to like that story.

93
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:12,086
I used to be able to get hard
without the blue pills, too.

94
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:14,389
Read 'em and weep.

95
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,123
- Yes, sir.
- Geez.

96
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,158
- Lucky day. Come on.
- Do I need to ask?

97
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
- The man's horny.
- Pop it in, buddy.

98
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:21,797
The man's pathetic.

99
00:10:23,232 --> 00:10:24,932
Look at this.
Look at this.

100
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,700
I'm looking. I'm looking.

101
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:28,369
Oh, Lord.

102
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:30,104
There we go.

103
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,974
- Hold on there. Hold...
- What?

104
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,007
You've been at this,
haven't you?

105
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,876
- I have.
- Uh-huh.

106
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:37,878
There's no telling
where his lips have been.

107
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,214
Yeah. I don't remember myself.
You'd better wipe that twice.

108
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:41,982
How about three times, will you?

109
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,652
Oh, there you go.

110
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:47,254
Here we go.

111
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:49,089
To us.
Still here.

112
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:52,126
- Still here.
- Still fuckin' here.

113
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:54,962
I thought
you had that fixed, man.

114
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,464
I thought I did, too, damn it.

115
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,799
Shh. Come on.
This is my favorite part.

116
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,769
- Standing in the way.
- You're blocking the man's view.

117
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,738
Two. Three. Take it down.

118
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,241
Come on. Reach!
Two. Three.

119
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:17,144
Gentlemen!
My heroes.

120
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:19,547
Whoo!

121
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:21,416
What a great day, huh?

122
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:22,883
Mm!

123
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:24,151
Look at Lou,
all spruced up, man.

124
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:25,052
Yeah.

125
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,020
Did the Better Business Bureau

126
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,822
close down Lou's Lemons?

127
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:31,526
No business today on account
of it's a very special day.

128
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:34,328
No, no. Not you too.
No way. No!

129
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,431
On account of this being
a very special day,

130
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,801
I need you to do me a favor.

131
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:42,202
Let me get you
out of that ancient,

132
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:44,037
rusted prehistoric truck.

133
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,839
I'll pass.

134
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,442
I'll give you 2%
off the sticker.

135
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,576
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God.

136
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:49,544
Two percent.

137
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:52,580
One, because I love you
and you're my pal.

138
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:54,415
Two, because it's your birthday.

139
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,150
It's got to be a cash deal,
though, because...

140
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,054
well, because
of your advanced age.

141
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,824
Lay off him, Lou,
especially today.

142
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,893
I can negotiate anything, huh?
I'm an animal.

143
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:08,895
Yeah.
Goddamn snake.

144
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,532
Ooh.

145
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:14,402
Hey, hey.
You know what, Lou?

146
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:16,471
You keep reminding me
it's my birthday...

147
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,205
and this goes
for all of youse...

148
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,408
I'll start reminding you
of your tabs.

149
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,477
- Now, come on, man.
- Sure, he will. Sure, he will.

150
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:25,446
Before you do, Zabriski's glass
looks a little light.

151
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,314
Yeah. Excuse me.

152
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:29,249
Glad somebody is looking out
for me.

153
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,951
- Thank you, Doug. Ooh.
- I got you, buddy.

154
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,620
Geez.

155
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:35,889
You run over a fuckin' skunk
on the way here?

156
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:38,292
- No. Upgraded, you know?
- Yeah?

157
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:41,362
Medical. Yeah.
It's California green.

158
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:43,297
What do you got,
some kind of condition?

159
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,366
Nurse at the VA.

160
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:46,967
Oh.
It's preexisting.

161
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,104
I hear they got scientists
making that shit now.

162
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:52,039
- Mm.
- Yeah.

163
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,175
Bring a man
to a whole other dimension.

164
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,445
I want some of that
science weed. Come on.

165
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,946
Not that. You lipped it.
Get out of here.

166
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,984
Yeah. I'll roll you a bone.

167
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,386
One for Freddy.

168
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:07,622
Maybe the old man
wants to join in, too.

169
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:09,990
No, no, no, no.

170
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:12,926
Only poison I'm going to put
into this wonderful body

171
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,429
is right here.

172
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:17,064
Maybe Freddy. Huh?
Roll one up for the occasion?

173
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,198
Come on.

174
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,132
You roll whatever you want,

175
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:20,901
but how many times
do I have to tell you

176
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,670
to take that shit outside, Doug?

177
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:25,238
Huh? What's wrong with you?
What, are you high?

178
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,239
Freddy.

179
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,911
Hey, Freddy, how about we close
the bar down early tonight?

180
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,312
What do you say?

181
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,314
What do you say
we got customers here, huh?

182
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:36,484
- I'll chase them off.
- You're the man for that.

183
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:38,051
What do you got going on?

184
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:40,287
The best birthday
that Freddy ever got.

185
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,428
Fuckin' idiots.

186
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,465
Fuckin' bunch of morons
is what you fuckin' are.

187
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:36,744
Boz, that's more
than double what it's worth.

188
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:38,479
Are you sure this is legit?

189
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,748
You know Roadie's fucked this up
before.

190
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,018
Jesus Christ.
Let <i>me</i> worry about <i>my</i> brother.

191
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,053
Clear these hypers out of here.

192
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:48,288
I don't want anything
fucking this up.

193
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,750
These are shitty cigarettes.
You know that?

194
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:18,352
You got shitty cigarettes.

195
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:23,591
How come you don't got no
organic True 100s or something?

196
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:26,326
I'll get right on it, Walter.

197
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:29,296
Mm!
All right, gentlemen.

198
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:33,401
Gather around the campfire,
because it's story time.

199
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:36,637
The year... 1969.

200
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,271
We're overseas.

201
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:43,611
And this is when Fred was,
you know, not this exactly.

202
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:49,484
I got a weekend of R&R
at some shitty fuel depot,

203
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:54,054
and I'm drunk as a payday skunk,
and I see this guy coming, okay?

204
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,523
Now, I hate the son of a bitch

205
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,658
'cause he used to pitch
for the Rockets,

206
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,060
which was two towns over,

207
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:04,732
and he beaned me in the skull
with a fastball senior year.

208
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,735
Boom! I go down, okay?

209
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,336
And I'm...

210
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:13,108
And... So I'm gonna take
this guy apart, but...

211
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:16,109
You know where you are, kid?

212
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:18,646
You're in the, uh, VFW post.

213
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:20,247
Want me to check his ID, man?

214
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:23,083
May be a situation
of stolen valor.

215
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,552
Come on. Check it.
Just check it, man.

216
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,854
No.
Be sure.

217
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,724
All right, Abe.

218
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:31,661
Uh-huh.

219
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,195
What are you drinking?

220
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,632
Beer, please.

221
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,700
You leading a parade?

222
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:42,503
Ha.
No.

223
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:44,271
Buddy of mine told me,

224
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,273
"If you wear your uniform
on the plane,

225
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,509
they'll bump you up
to first class."

226
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:49,677
Didn't happen.

227
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,313
Hey, Walter,
this will shut you up.

228
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:54,682
- Man just got home.
- Yes!

229
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:56,817
- Oh, hey!
- Yes, sir!

230
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,686
Don't think about reaching
for your wallet.

231
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,688
Nobody pays first day back.

232
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,290
Fred, gentlemen's preference
all around.

233
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,426
I'll contribute to the cause.

234
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,728
But not from that paint thinner
of the shelf.

235
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,296
Up there.

236
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,365
I was just getting
to the good part, guys.

237
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,468
Yeah. You must have been
taking the scenic route.

238
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,803
Hey, new fella.

239
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:17,371
- Shawn.
- Shane.

240
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,139
Shawn.

241
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,708
Whatever.

242
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,275
I don't even know you,

243
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:24,579
but I know you're gonna
fuckin' love this.

244
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:28,148
I knocked this motherfucker out
ice cold on the ground,

245
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,753
and I'm looking down at him,
and I go, "Oh, shit!"

246
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:36,156
'Cause I just realized
he is a fucking staff sergeant.

247
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,758
He's got like seven ranks on me.

248
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,227
I'm... I-I'm 19 years old.
I'm shitting myself.

249
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:44,865
"Oh, fuck, I am court-martialed.
I am so dead."

250
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,200
And what's the first words
out of your mouth?

251
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:48,636
Fred, you remember
what you said?

252
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:50,339
First words.

253
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,709
I said, uh...

254
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:59,847
"...Soldier...
you like American poontang?"

255
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,882
Yes!

256
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:03,718
That's right!

257
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,285
That's what he said.

258
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,722
I thought I knocked some marbles
loose.

259
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:09,890
But no, he's got tickets
in his pocket

260
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,526
for that night's USO show,

261
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:18,264
where Miss 1963 is shaking her
mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

262
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,767
Oh, it was glorious.

263
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:21,569
It was.

264
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:26,339
Freddy says he's taking so much
high heat from the Viet Cong

265
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:29,910
that that little
red-white-and-blue right hook...

266
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,312
<i>that</i> felt like home.

267
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:33,914
He makes a couple
of phone calls,

268
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,551
and first thing I know,
I'm transferred into his unit.

269
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,355
And me and Lou over here
and Fred,

270
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:43,958
we finished out our tours,
and we all come home together,

271
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,594
and we...
we fart around in town.

272
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:48,963
We're painting houses and shit.

273
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:51,799
And then one day,
we say, "Fuck it,"

274
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:55,670
and we take the first plane
back into the shit, you know?

275
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:58,873
But that was...

276
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,941
And that was enough for me,

277
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:03,911
But... But Fred...
Holy cripes.

278
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:05,546
He's... He keeps going.

279
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:07,014
He goes like five tours of duty,
right?

280
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,616
That's enough, Walter.
All right.

281
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:10,384
You should have seen
this bastard over there.

282
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:11,519
- All right.
- Alive, I fuckin' tell you.

283
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:12,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Hey, hey.

284
00:20:12,822 --> 00:20:14,488
Let it go, huh?

285
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,857
I'm just getting
to the big twist here, okay?

286
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,359
Here comes the purple nurple.

287
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:20,561
Miss 1963.

288
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:22,965
Fred, you ever wonder
what happened to that girl?

289
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,700
She got married.
She had a couple of kids.

290
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:28,536
And one of them followed
in Mama's career path,

291
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,538
and that is why
I'm going to ask you

292
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,674
the same delicately phrased
question that you asked me

293
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:35,776
all those years ago...

294
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:39,413
Do you like American poontang?

295
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:41,982
What is this?

296
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:47,455
'Cause Miss 1963 had a kid
that's name is Crystal now,

297
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:51,425
and she's dancing on the pole
tonight at midnight

298
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:53,293
at the Deja Vu over on Lincoln.

299
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,528
- Aw, come on.
- And we're all going.

300
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,030
We're all going,

301
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:58,632
and you can't say no
'cause this is a celebration,

302
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,501
and we're not celebrating
in this shithole.

303
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:01,936
Watering hole.

304
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:04,805
Oh, geez.
Shitty watering hole.

305
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,742
And you, my young friend,

306
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:11,412
you are gonna get
a hero's homecoming.

307
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:12,680
That's how.

308
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:14,548
All right?

309
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,316
I'm serious.

310
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,918
So get your shit together.

311
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,822
We leave at 2300 hours
or whenever I finish urinating,

312
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,323
whichever comes first.

313
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,892
No, no, no.

314
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:26,727
That... That's it.

315
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,334
She got no pussy hairs.

316
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:34,835
Pardon?

317
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,737
I like pussy hairs.

318
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,944
What gives her the right
to cut off her pussy hairs?

319
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,445
It's <i>her</i> pussy.

320
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:47,815
I don't understand
how they get it so smooth,

321
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,117
like a goddamn ice luge.

322
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,852
Lasers.

323
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,621
Laser... Of course!

324
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,990
- The kid knows! Lasers!
- The kid knows. The kid knows.

325
00:21:55,992 --> 00:22:00,461
Moonraker, blasting cunt hairs
from outer space.

326
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:01,864
Pew! Pew!

327
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:03,998
You don't get it.

328
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,933
Back in the day,

329
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:09,103
I used to buy toothpicks
by the gross.

330
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:10,471
Just in case.
You know what I'm saying?

331
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:14,508
- Wait a minute.
- Am I having a stroke?

332
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,721
If he says we need to move,
we need to move.

333
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,390
Is everything else ready?

334
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:32,428
Yeah, everything else
is ready to go.

335
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,818
We got a major problem here.
They're out of control.

336
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,800
All right.

337
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:15,636
This place is fucked.

338
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:18,105
Plan B.
I'll grab the stuff.

339
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:19,907
Do what you got to do.

340
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:28,718
Fuck!

341
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:33,520
Oh, for fuck's sake.

342
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,959
Who the fuck was in here?!

343
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:40,162
Hey!

344
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:42,999
Fuck.

345
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:46,068
Lizard!

346
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,803
Lizard!

347
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:03,886
They don't know
what they're missing.

348
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:09,191
This darkness...

349
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,931
...it's perfect.

350
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:21,470
It's peace.

351
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:31,647
God damn it.

352
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:37,718
I'm afraid
that's all she wrote, boys.

353
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:41,221
Party's over.
Time to call it a day.

354
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:44,124
Fred, I've been telling you
about this guy.

355
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,894
This guy Eddie Harris, he's
the best electrician in town.

356
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:49,196
He could rewire
this whole goddamn dump.

357
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,731
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, he'll have it humming.

358
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,566
Oh, yeah.
Or not.

359
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:56,570
Hell, you might even be able
to serve beer when it's cold.

360
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:02,977
Lou, if he's anything like the
plumber you sent over last time,

361
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,545
keep his number.

362
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:12,653
Don't say a fucking word.

363
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,523
What did you do?

364
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,134
Listen up.

365
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:31,972
A filthy,
filthy little reptile...

366
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:36,877
you all know her as Lizard...
has stolen your fix!

367
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:39,179
Hype... all you want,

368
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:42,783
enough to liquefy
your fucking tonsils...

369
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,286
to whoever brings me the girl.

370
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:51,060
Lizard's sister...
What purpose did that serve?

371
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,660
She won't get away.

372
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:55,229
The hypers will retrieve her.

373
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:57,967
Half of them can barely walk.

374
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:03,005
Don't underestimate them,
Gutter.

375
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:08,342
You see...

376
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:14,248
an army of brain-dead animals...
is still an army.

377
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:53,921
Freddy, this will cheer you up.

378
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:55,390
She's still dancing tonight.

379
00:26:55,392 --> 00:26:56,558
- Aw...
- No. Come on.

380
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,827
No, Walt. I think I'm checking
out early and closing up.

381
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:01,061
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

382
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:02,930
Now, the taps,
they might be running, right?

383
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:05,332
Yeah.
All right.

384
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,401
One for the road.

385
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:08,335
- Ranger?
- Yes, sir.

386
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,772
Hey, soldier boy, don't you have
a baby's mama to go home to?

387
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:15,309
No. I have a wife.
You got any extra toothpicks?

388
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:17,445
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

389
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,749
Lizard, get back here!

390
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:26,188
Lizard!

391
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,927
What the hell?

392
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:39,900
Guys?

393
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:41,235
- Hey!
- What?

394
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:43,704
Fred, there's
this fucking girl...

395
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,474
- Hey!
- Hey!

396
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:49,877
God damn it, Lizard!
What the hell did you do?

397
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:50,878
Hey!

398
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:54,114
Jesus Christ!

399
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:57,385
Christ!
Get down!

400
00:27:57,387 --> 00:27:59,153
No!

401
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:15,871
Son of a bitch piece of trash.

402
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:22,075
Shit. Shit.

403
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,379
Doug, man.

404
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:27,948
What in the cocksucking fuck
just went on here?

405
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,750
Oh, Fred. Fred.

406
00:28:29,752 --> 00:28:31,419
Oh, C-Christ!

407
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:33,921
F-Fred... I'm dead.

408
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:35,322
No, you're not dead.
You hang in there.

409
00:28:35,324 --> 00:28:37,492
You hear me, brother?
You hang in there!

410
00:28:37,494 --> 00:28:39,226
Here.
Help me out here, boys.

411
00:28:39,228 --> 00:28:41,396
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

412
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,098
Whoa, whoa. Go... No, no.
Go real easy. Real easy.

413
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,368
That shoulder looks like
it's hanging by a thread.

414
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,236
Oh, wonderful.

415
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:51,205
Sit him up.
All right. Here we go.

416
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,242
Lift. Lift. Here we go.

417
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,143
- Over to here.
- To the bar.

418
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:58,111
- Come on. Watch. Watch his head.
- I got him. I got him.

419
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,214
- I got... Don't worry.
- A little higher.

420
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,149
- Watch his head. Watch his head.
- Higher.

421
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:03,884
Good.

422
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:05,420
Kid, go shut the door,
will you?

423
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:06,521
We got you.

424
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:09,056
You got to get
a tourniquet on there, man.

425
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:10,525
All right.
Keep this open.

426
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:12,527
- You stay with us.
- Don't worry about me.

427
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,495
- Where did the kid...
- Hold that arm up.

428
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:16,230
Dougie, open your eyes.

429
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,499
Doug, you hear me?
I want your eyes open.

430
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:24,204
You're coming with me, bitch!

431
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:26,039
Hey, punk!

432
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:39,019
I got this, kid.

433
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:41,088
This is for Doug, you fuck!

434
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,558
Yeah!
That's right!

435
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,261
Fuck!

436
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:49,932
Fuckin' punk fuck!

437
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:52,899
Breathe.

438
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,135
It's like patching
a busted water main.

439
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:57,104
See?
This ain't working, huh?

440
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:58,905
- Yes, it is. Just breathe.
- Easy, Doug.

441
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:04,211
What the fuck is going on
out there?!

442
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:06,947
Hey, kid, check that side door.

443
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:09,318
Easy.
Easy, easy.

444
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:12,119
- You all right?
- Yeah.

445
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,960
Anybody else
want to come in my bar?!

446
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:25,566
Oh! God!

447
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:38,446
Hard line.
Other way out?

448
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:39,447
At the hall?

449
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:41,416
All right. All right.
Move your ass. Let's go!

450
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,417
- Okay.
- Come on.

451
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:49,524
Jesus Christ.
Where's your head at, Lou?

452
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:51,291
- I got blood all over me.
- We need a better tourniquet.

453
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:52,926
- Give me your belt.
- It's alligator skin.

454
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,831
Give me your fuckin' belt,
or I'll strangle you with it.

455
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:04,340
Jesus.

456
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:10,079
How's he doing?

457
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:13,080
Not good.

458
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,616
Well, you keep him breathing.

459
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:17,385
We're bugging out the back.

460
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:18,653
Yes, sir.

461
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,355
Easy.
Okay.

462
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:21,957
- A little tighter.
- Yeah, a little tighter.

463
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:30,063
What do we got out there?

464
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:31,399
Looks clear.

465
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:33,333
All right.
Fuck this.

466
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:34,669
I'll pull my car around.

467
00:31:34,671 --> 00:31:37,572
We'll get Doug in,
and we all leave and eat.

468
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,585
Whoa!

469
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:51,586
- Shit!
- Holy shit!

470
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:04,066
Get in there!

471
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:18,046
Where's Z?

472
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:20,383
He's dead.

473
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:27,020
What the hell is going on here,
man?!

474
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:28,556
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

475
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:30,691
I mean, that trash
comes rushing in here,

476
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:33,293
and all of a sudden it's like
Khe Sanh all over again.

477
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:35,095
I mean, those animals outside,

478
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:37,230
don't they know we're
supposed to be at the titty bar?

479
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:38,666
We're supposed to be celebrating
Freddy's birthday!

480
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:42,068
Lou!
Shut your fuckin' yap!

481
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,571
There's nothing more we can do
for him here.

482
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:45,673
We got to get him to a hospital
<i>now.</i>

483
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:47,575
All right.
We're gonna.

484
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:49,176
Look, Abe.

485
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:51,646
Look, there's clean rags
behind the bar.

486
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:53,648
You keep pressure
on that shoulder.

487
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,416
Just... You keep him breathing.

488
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:58,318
The rest of you,
secure the doors.

489
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,021
What do we do, just sit here
with our thumbs up our asses?

490
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,557
Hey, Lou.
It's gonna be all right.

491
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,760
The smaller force acts while
the larger force regroups.

492
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:08,496
I'm gonna bring the truck
right up to the door.

493
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:10,197
We're gonna get him in it,

494
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,366
and we're gonna get ourselves
out of here alive.

495
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,402
- Roger that.
- All right. Let's move.

496
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:16,437
Time's on their side
not on ours.

497
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,806
It sure as shit
is not on Doug's.

498
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:20,508
Let's do it.

499
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,478
Get that pool table over here.
Barricade it, all right?

500
00:33:57,547 --> 00:33:59,212
Come on!

501
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:14,662
Fred.

502
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:17,565
Hey.
Listen.

503
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:21,502
You and me both know
this ain't the only option.

504
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:24,170
We can push Miss Teen USA
right back out the front door

505
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:25,673
the way she came in.

506
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,677
Is that the man you want to be,
Walter?

507
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,748
Well...

508
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,684
All right. Look.
I got your six.

509
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:38,419
Get to your truck

510
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:41,221
and get your ass to
the police station ricky-ticky.

511
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:44,392
Hey, uh, you said something
a little while ago.

512
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:46,761
It was like, uh, "Oh, you should
have seen that bastard

513
00:34:46,763 --> 00:34:48,194
when we were over there.

514
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,764
- He was alive."
- Yeah.

515
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:52,132
I'll tell you something,
brother.

516
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,267
I'm feeling pretty fucking alive
right now.

517
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:56,704
Yeah.
We're trying to stay that way.

518
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:16,819
God damn it.

519
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,224
Aah! Aah!

520
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:28,663
Give it back.

521
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:29,730
What?

522
00:36:29,732 --> 00:36:32,400
Give... it... back.

523
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:35,872
I don't know
what you're talking about!

524
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:39,473
Then you die.

525
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:48,751
Come on, bitch!
Come on!

526
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:00,961
Fred.
Fred, you all right?

527
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:03,497
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.

528
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:04,665
- Appreciate it, Walter.
- Jesus.

529
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,000
Really appreciate it.

530
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,205
Shit. That was...
Oh, shit.

531
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:13,874
- All right.
- I got the one on the left.

532
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,546
Fred! Walter!
Come on!

533
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:19,880
These things are crawling
all over the place!

534
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:21,982
Come on!

535
00:37:29,324 --> 00:37:30,323
Fuck.

536
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:31,894
Oh, Jesus.

537
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,564
Oh, my God.

538
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:41,702
You got a piece.

539
00:37:41,704 --> 00:37:42,939
I do.

540
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:46,373
You're good with it.

541
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,809
75th Ranger Regiment, sir.

542
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:50,845
Some of the guys
took to calling me Dead Eye.

543
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,713
That is a clever moniker.

544
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:56,352
Well... Dead Eye, I'm...

545
00:37:57,687 --> 00:38:00,788
...I'm glad you were in the mood
for a beer tonight.

546
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,322
That makes one of us.

547
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:03,659
Now what?

548
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:06,794
Now the girl talks.

549
00:38:06,796 --> 00:38:08,629
Two hours and nothing.

550
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:10,564
Don't you think the police
would have heard something?

551
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:12,967
What? In this neighborhood?
Gunshots are like crickets.

552
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:14,302
It's like background noise.

553
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:17,004
Cavalry ain't coming, Lou.

554
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:19,375
It's Q&A time, kid.

555
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,677
Sit!

556
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:24,645
What's your name?

557
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:26,781
Elizabeth.
Call me Lizard.

558
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:28,516
Well, my name is Fred.

559
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:31,385
And see, the problem is
that me and my old friends

560
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:34,121
are probably gonna die tonight
unless you help us out

561
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:36,724
to understand
what's happening here.

562
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,659
Couple minutes ago,
some woman tried to kill me

563
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:39,960
in the parking lot.

564
00:38:39,962 --> 00:38:43,697
But what really pissed me off
is that bitch trashed my truck,

565
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:48,571
and, Lizard,
I really, really love my truck.

566
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,874
She also said to me,
"Give it back."

567
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:54,108
What's that supposed to mean?

568
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:58,112
She didn't say, "Give her back,"
or, "Give Lizard back."

569
00:38:58,114 --> 00:38:59,980
No, no.
She said, "Give it back."

570
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:02,852
So what is "it"?
Huh?

571
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,988
Hard case.

572
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,790
When she came in...
anybody see?...

573
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:11,425
was she carrying something
with her?

574
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:13,460
- Not that I saw.
- No, I didn't see shit, man.

575
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:15,930
I was busy focusing on this jerk
trying to cut off Doug's arm.

576
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:18,699
Why don't you quit
this true-grit bullshit

577
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:20,434
and just throw her out the door?

578
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:22,770
I mean, maybe you got this
merciful stuff still in you,

579
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:24,972
but I don't have it in my body
anymore.

580
00:39:24,974 --> 00:39:26,807
Now, you...

581
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:28,576
- Hey. Whoa.
- ...you speak, honey,

582
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:30,077
or I'm gonna lace
right into you.

583
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,580
You're not gonna lace
into anybody.

584
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:34,748
- This is my joint, all right?
- Neither are you, man.

585
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,886
Fuck!

586
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,186
Shit!

587
00:39:39,188 --> 00:39:41,657
All right. All right.
It's nothing.

588
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,191
All right?

589
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:45,492
Sorry.

590
00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:47,530
Go on.
Clean yourself up.

591
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:50,499
Your own fault!

592
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:53,736
- It's his own fault.
- Yeah.

593
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,505
Give me some good news.

594
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:00,808
Eliminated one man.
Couldn't get inside.

595
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,678
Where's Roadie?

596
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,983
He's dead.
Bartender shot him.

597
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:35,978
Yeah.

598
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:39,813
That's when you used to be fine,
Fred.

599
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,861
Shit.

600
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:57,932
Well.

601
00:40:57,934 --> 00:40:58,966
Hey.

602
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:01,101
Little Miss Bo Peep here,

603
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:03,539
she's been playing
hide-and-seek with us.

604
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:07,942
Oh.

605
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:09,510
Geez.

606
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:11,914
God.

607
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,248
How much is this?

608
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,216
That is a whole fuckin' lot.
That's what that is.

609
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:18,754
It's enough
to kill the kid over.

610
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:22,058
Hey.
Did you steal this?

611
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:27,761
Boz killed my sister, all right?

612
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:31,165
This, though, it's all he's got,
this whole fucking life.

613
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,767
Well, there it is...
We just give this back,

614
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:36,770
and the nightmare ends, and then
we can go to the titty bar,

615
00:41:36,772 --> 00:41:40,107
- where we're supposed to be.
- It doesn't work like that.

616
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:42,109
That guy over there
with the exploded fucking head,

617
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:45,612
that's Roadie,
Boz's little brother.

618
00:41:45,614 --> 00:41:49,685
"VFW."

619
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:52,886
What the fuck is that?

620
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:55,089
Veterans of Foreign Wars.

621
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:57,893
Soldiers?
Good.

622
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:01,762
Soldiers are good at dying.

623
00:42:01,764 --> 00:42:03,731
You guys murdered
his little brother.

624
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:06,033
- Now, Boz won't stop until he...
- Killed every one of us, right?

625
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:08,168
Yeah, and your kids
and your grandkids

626
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,904
and... your great-grandkids.

627
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,706
Jesus Christ.
How fuckin' old are you guys?

628
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:13,807
Screw you, bitch.

629
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:17,244
Oh, pump the brakes
on the old-guy stuff, all right?

630
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:19,780
I don't know about this murder.
Could be manslaughter.

631
00:42:19,782 --> 00:42:20,914
He came in with a big damn ax.

632
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,283
Jesus Christ, Walter!
What the hell is the difference?

633
00:42:23,285 --> 00:42:25,586
I feel like I'm in
the twilight zone, okay?

634
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:27,654
Because this little girl here,
this little child,

635
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:30,224
she is dictating to us
what's gonna go down!

636
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:32,226
Maybe your sister,
maybe that little junkie

637
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,194
- deserved to fucking get it.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

638
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,697
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off!

639
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:39,133
Hey!
This is my post, my rules.

640
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:41,702
You don't like it, then
walk the hell out of here, huh?

641
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:44,004
- Let's put her outside the...
- Crying out loud!

642
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:46,106
Shut up, Lou.

643
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:48,978
Hey.
Here.

644
00:42:49,812 --> 00:42:52,946
You were a soldier.
You were a good soldier.

645
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:55,049
So were we all, weren't we?

646
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:57,885
So let's act like it.

647
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,955
We set a perimeter.

648
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:02,289
We make our stand.

649
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,691
Remember the Alamo.

650
00:43:04,693 --> 00:43:06,727
Yeah, but they all died
at the Alamo.

651
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:08,262
- Yeah.
- Dumb shit.

652
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:11,433
All right.

653
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,901
I got nine rounds
for the 12-gauge.

654
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:16,236
- Ranger?
- I got three left in the .45.

655
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:18,205
I got a big damn fire ax,

656
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:20,974
and Doug can attest
to the effectiveness of that.

657
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,709
So, what do you think, kid?

658
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:24,344
It's not enough.

659
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:26,282
We'd better get to work.

660
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,667
Hey.
How are you with this?

661
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:49,036
No, I got this.
I got this.

662
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:49,870
You sure?

663
00:43:49,872 --> 00:43:51,972
They didn't get
my trigger finger.

664
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:10,159
Huh.

665
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,404
Be good to me, Gordie.

666
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:46,793
Ooh, boy.

667
00:44:46,795 --> 00:44:48,429
Right up his ass.

668
00:44:48,431 --> 00:44:50,099
Bring 'em.

669
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:53,233
This little piggy went
to market.

670
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:55,037
I don't want to tell you
where that one's gonna go.

671
00:45:00,176 --> 00:45:02,377
Here we go. Little more.
Little more. Little more.

672
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,129
See, the trick is to get
the snap and the flick

673
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:27,937
all in one very cool...
very fluid motion.

674
00:45:30,407 --> 00:45:31,939
I used to be good at it,

675
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:36,810
but, uh, my fingers
are getting kind of stiff.

676
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:41,048
This place is kind of gross.

677
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,985
This place is our VFW Post 2494.

678
00:45:44,987 --> 00:45:46,421
What's that mean?

679
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:49,890
It means it's... a home.

680
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:51,258
At least for me, it is.

681
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,462
And for the rest of these bums.

682
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:59,800
See, when we got back from Nam,
we just kind of gravitated,

683
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:05,040
you know, washed up here
like some kind of a tide.

684
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,578
There used to be more of us.

685
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,215
There used to be a lot more
of us, but...

686
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:17,150
What was it like over there?

687
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:19,152
- Nam?
- Yeah.

688
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,093
I remember the mud.

689
00:46:25,362 --> 00:46:28,030
And the crawling in the mud.

690
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:32,234
A lot of men died in the mud.

691
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,271
I hated the fucking mud.

692
00:46:38,408 --> 00:46:41,975
Now, uh, Abe, you know, he's...

693
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:43,245
Ow.

694
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,047
You know, he's the, uh,
old sourpuss

695
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:50,418
with all the charm
of a clawhammer.

696
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,085
He wasn't in Nam.

697
00:46:52,087 --> 00:46:54,622
Nah.
He's Korea.

698
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:57,124
Different war, same shit.

699
00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:58,292
Same mud?

700
00:46:58,294 --> 00:47:00,528
Yeah.

701
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,364
Same mud, except his was frozen.

702
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:09,470
Yeah, and Old Ranger Rick...
you know, Shawn...

703
00:47:09,472 --> 00:47:13,040
he just got back
from the desert.

704
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,609
No mud over there.

705
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:17,380
Just a whole shitload of sand.

706
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:20,349
Don't matter where you fought.

707
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:25,319
You make it back,
you got a home right here.

708
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,570
You ready?

709
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:44,938
Don't get killed
by those antlers.

710
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,441
They'll poke your eyeballs out.

711
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:49,178
Yeah. No problem.
No problem.

712
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:57,284
All right.

713
00:47:57,286 --> 00:47:59,354
Don't kill them all at once,
now.

714
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:01,154
Fuck it.

715
00:48:01,156 --> 00:48:03,460
Now I'm not gonna leave
any of them for you.

716
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:07,595
I like the sound of that,
Gordie.

717
00:48:07,597 --> 00:48:11,100
Hey. Here.
I got something for you.

718
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,637
Ooh.

719
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:18,305
You know,
I think we're gonna be fine

720
00:48:18,307 --> 00:48:21,210
as long as they come at us
on skates.

721
00:48:39,328 --> 00:48:42,430
Well...

722
00:48:42,432 --> 00:48:45,466
I imagine we're gonna have
some company any time now,

723
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:48,436
so why don't you get yourself
behind the bar

724
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:49,236
and look out for Doug?

725
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:50,738
No, no, no.
I can... I can help.

726
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,305
No doubt.

727
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:55,376
You'll be helping
by looking out for Doug.

728
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:57,978
And if shit goes sideways...

729
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,514
I'll kill them.

730
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:01,584
I knew you were a hard case.

731
00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:25,138
Come on, motherfucker.

732
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:38,553
Ah.
Let 'em come.

733
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:40,721
Here we go.

734
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:45,125
- I got to help!
- Relax. Relax.

735
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:46,794
- T-They're my friends!
- They're gonna be all right.

736
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:48,261
You're good. Just relax.

737
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:07,347
Get to the grenades!

738
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:09,717
- Yeah. I got this.
- Get it out!

739
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:12,420
- Light that for me, will you?
- No. That's not good for you.

740
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,622
Oh, come on.
Are you fucking kidding me, kid?

741
00:50:14,624 --> 00:50:15,656
It's medical.

742
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:29,804
- Are we winning?
- Yeah.

743
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:31,173
Your friends are kicking ass.

744
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:44,454
Aah!

745
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:03,437
Hey!

746
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:10,212
Aah!

747
00:51:11,346 --> 00:51:12,813
Come on, Lou!

748
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:14,281
Jesus Christ.

749
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:15,883
Sorry, Gordie.

750
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,790
A little... A little help here.

751
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:35,770
Fuckin' hippie.

752
00:51:35,772 --> 00:51:37,405
Here.
You dropped this.

753
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:38,606
Aah!

754
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:59,660
Oh. Whoa. I got you.
I got you.

755
00:51:59,662 --> 00:52:00,895
I got you.

756
00:52:00,897 --> 00:52:02,763
What, you're my fucking savior
now?

757
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:13,273
Now I got blood <i>and</i> pickled
pork shit on my jacket.

758
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:14,442
Well, you look good.

759
00:52:14,444 --> 00:52:15,776
Thanks.

760
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:18,111
Hey.

761
00:52:18,113 --> 00:52:19,279
You're gonna have
to walk it off.

762
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:22,182
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you, man.
- Take a seat right there.

763
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:23,818
Everybody in one piece?

764
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,920
Well, let me check.
Yep.

765
00:52:43,338 --> 00:52:44,339
Oh, shit.

766
00:53:38,027 --> 00:53:40,728
Oh, shit.

767
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,662
Come on.

768
00:53:41,664 --> 00:53:43,964
- Oh, God. Hey. Good j...
- You all right?

769
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:45,900
Oh, good job.
I'll tell you.

770
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:49,003
That son of bitch
stoved my chest in.

771
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:50,671
Any more of these
prehistoric creatures

772
00:53:50,673 --> 00:53:51,872
coming through that door?

773
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:53,574
Get those doors barricaded.

774
00:53:53,576 --> 00:53:55,609
Let's use those bodies
as sandbags, all right?

775
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:56,412
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

776
00:53:56,979 --> 00:53:59,214
It's taking too long.

777
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:03,986
The old men must have killed
Tank.

778
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:08,391
Fuck.

779
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,026
Sun's up soon.

780
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:14,262
If we don't get inside,
it's over.

781
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:23,003
Load up.

782
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,308
Heavy stuff.
Hard stuff.

783
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:31,914
I'm tired
of fucking playing games.

784
00:55:08,084 --> 00:55:11,821
Thanks for saving my life,
Elizabeth.

785
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:15,623
I started this.

786
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:18,559
Let's finish it.

787
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:23,633
Hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

788
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:27,134
You only winged him.

789
00:55:27,136 --> 00:55:29,605
Are you losing your touch?

790
00:55:30,072 --> 00:55:32,773
Don't... Don't make...
Don't make me laugh.

791
00:55:32,775 --> 00:55:34,844
It... It hurts a lot.

792
00:55:38,147 --> 00:55:39,980
Oh.

793
00:55:39,982 --> 00:55:42,416
I think it's time to call
this game.

794
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:47,488
- No way, brother.
- One more for the road.

795
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:51,659
I'll give you one more,
but... it's not for the road.

796
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:54,161
It's for my birthday, remember?
It's my birthday.

797
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:55,830
Well, listen.
I'm older than you.

798
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:57,967
Y-You got to listen to me
right now, so...

799
00:55:58,634 --> 00:56:00,668
- Happy birthday.
- Yes.

800
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:07,510
You're all right.

801
00:56:23,526 --> 00:56:24,894
Hey, kid.

802
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:30,399
You know what I said, uh,
when you first came in?

803
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:32,867
Yeah.

804
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:33,901
Okay.

805
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:37,071
Well, when you get to be my age,

806
00:56:37,073 --> 00:56:39,375
people don't really give a shit
what you say.

807
00:56:39,842 --> 00:56:41,377
I'll just be ready.

808
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:44,011
I'd like the chance to get
to your age, old man.

809
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:47,581
- Lou.
- Yeah.

810
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:50,718
You know that bag she brought
in here full of shit?

811
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,019
Yeah.

812
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:55,890
What if you had all of that
in cash?

813
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:58,692
Cash.
Cold, hard cash.

814
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:00,429
What would you do with that?

815
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:03,197
- You know what I'd do...
- Mm?

816
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:05,466
...with all those funds
from that garbage?

817
00:57:05,468 --> 00:57:07,534
Yeah.

818
00:57:07,536 --> 00:57:13,073
I'd buy each one of us
a really nice casket...

819
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:18,512
gold trim, extra cushion,
Tempur-Pedic foam.

820
00:57:18,514 --> 00:57:19,880
Uh-huh.

821
00:57:19,882 --> 00:57:21,982
The best money could buy

822
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:27,221
so that we'd all be cozy,
like two little bears in a glen,

823
00:57:27,223 --> 00:57:29,556
after we die.

824
00:57:29,558 --> 00:57:32,159
You know what?

825
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:34,897
Your foxhole chitchat
needs work.

826
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,503
Jesus.
Fuck.

827
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:44,972
Lou's sliding off the deep end.

828
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:47,708
He's gonna be Section 8
any minute now.

829
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:48,876
We got to hold him.

830
00:57:48,878 --> 00:57:51,578
No. No, no.
That ain't the way.

831
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,514
Look, those fuckers,
they got to be hurting, too.

832
00:57:53,516 --> 00:57:55,816
I'm gonna go out there.
I'm gonna make a run for it.

833
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:58,018
- Fred. Oh, wait a minute.
- I'm gonna make a lot of noise.

834
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,154
I'm gonna draw them off,
and you get Doug to my truck

835
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:01,922
and get him
the hell out of here.

836
00:58:01,924 --> 00:58:03,223
Fred, you ain't gonna make it
two blocks

837
00:58:03,225 --> 00:58:04,359
without them being all over you.

838
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:07,695
Well, Walter, you telling me
you got a better idea?!

839
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:09,063
Dougie's dying on the bar!

840
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:11,031
You think I'm gonna let him
just bleed out there?

841
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:14,134
- That ain't gonna happen!
- Fred! Fred! Fred!

842
00:58:14,136 --> 00:58:16,003
- Oh, shit.
- The fuck is this?

843
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:17,604
Fred!

844
00:58:17,606 --> 00:58:18,539
You piece of shit!

845
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,007
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

846
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:20,908
Give it back!

847
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,544
Hey! Hey! Knock it off.
Knock it off.

848
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:25,612
- What's going on? Stop it.
- Give it back!

849
00:58:25,614 --> 00:58:26,880
What's going on?

850
00:58:26,882 --> 00:58:29,016
I can negotiate us
out of this mess.

851
00:58:29,018 --> 00:58:30,884
- No.
- I can.

852
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:33,589
I can do what you can't do.

853
00:58:34,323 --> 00:58:37,658
Just... Just have a little faith
in me, okay?

854
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,128
- Lou.
- Just this once.

855
00:58:41,197 --> 00:58:43,731
Lou, you, uh...

856
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:47,868
That bag is the only thing
that's keeping us alive, right?

857
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:50,070
You give that up,

858
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:53,207
they'll torch this place
like a matchbox.

859
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:55,644
You understand that, don't you?

860
00:59:10,026 --> 00:59:11,291
Good man.

861
00:59:11,293 --> 00:59:13,827
All right.
Whew!

862
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:15,729
What a day, huh?

863
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:19,733
Listen. Why don't you secure
the door and come on over here?

864
00:59:19,735 --> 00:59:22,171
Let's have a...
Let's have a shot, huh?

865
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:27,174
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

866
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:29,078
I'll tell you that.

867
00:59:31,147 --> 00:59:32,646
Hey! Hey! Lou!

868
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:33,914
Where the hell are you going,
man?

869
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:35,383
I'll be back.

870
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:40,022
After all...
we got a birthday to celebrate.

871
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:43,624
Lou!

872
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:45,626
Lou, wait!

873
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:10,184
He's out of his fucking mind.

874
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:11,985
He's a used-car salesman.

875
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:15,656
Yeah. He's got that goddamn
pussy party on his brain.

876
01:00:15,658 --> 01:00:17,124
Let's make a deal.

877
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:19,427
Let's close a deal.

878
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:23,864
I mean... how can I get you
in this car today, huh?

879
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:25,368
Sure.

880
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:28,702
Hey.
I'm... I'm not armed.

881
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:30,405
I came to have a conversation
man-to-man.

882
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:33,408
So... what's your offer?

883
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,576
Easy exchange.

884
01:00:34,578 --> 01:00:40,114
We'll give you back your, uh...
you know, your drugs.

885
01:00:40,116 --> 01:00:43,750
You can go on your way and...
and we'll go on ours.

886
01:00:43,752 --> 01:00:44,620
Intriguing.

887
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:50,190
Ultimately unacceptable
but intriguing.

888
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:54,362
There's only one
satisfactory solution,

889
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:58,401
and that is we get our product
back and each of you die.

890
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:06,275
Um... how about meet me halfway?

891
01:01:07,276 --> 01:01:10,811
I mean, negotiate with me.
This is what I do.

892
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:14,281
Y-You know Lou's Used?

893
01:01:14,283 --> 01:01:18,285
Maybe you've seen some of my,
um, my ads on TV.

894
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:21,255
The little blond girl saying,
"Want something ..."

895
01:01:21,257 --> 01:01:23,726
"You need something new?
Call Lou."

896
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:26,394
I'm Lou.

897
01:01:26,396 --> 01:01:28,363
That's me.

898
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:30,065
I'm not familiar.

899
01:01:33,002 --> 01:01:36,439
Mind if we talk honestly
for a second?

900
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,976
Um...

901
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:46,880
A friend inside there
has, uh, has kind of lost it.

902
01:01:46,882 --> 01:01:49,950
I mean, he thinks he's still
the... the platoon commander

903
01:01:49,952 --> 01:01:51,352
back in the fuckin' jungles,
you know?

904
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:52,221
Ugh.

905
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:56,091
So <i>he's</i> in charge?

906
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,193
Well, not really.

907
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:01,828
I mean, he... he's kind of
in charge there, but...

908
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,198
but, I mean, I carry a lot
of weight, too, you know?

909
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,967
- But I'm here talking to you.
- Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

910
01:02:09,238 --> 01:02:11,273
There's no negotiating.

911
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:18,981
However...
you may yet prove useful.

912
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:25,852
Fred!

913
01:02:25,854 --> 01:02:28,123
Your friend likes to talk!

914
01:02:28,824 --> 01:02:32,527
And you?
Will you now talk?

915
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:38,100
Send out the girl and the bag,
and I send him back!

916
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:40,501
Fred, what's up?

917
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:42,102
Give me the bag.

918
01:02:42,104 --> 01:02:45,005
This is the last time
I talk to you!

919
01:02:45,007 --> 01:02:46,541
Last time!

920
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:48,809
They're gonna kill both of you.

921
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:50,210
Fred, they're gonna
kill you both!

922
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:56,218
Your call, Fred!

923
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:03,426
This what you want?!

924
01:03:04,394 --> 01:03:06,093
You let him go!

925
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,327
Shit, Lou.
Come on.

926
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:12,369
If you want this,
you let my friend go!

927
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,305
Fuck.

928
01:03:17,072 --> 01:03:19,072
Fuck it.

929
01:03:19,074 --> 01:03:20,309
Kill him.

930
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:34,391
Fred, on your left!

931
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:43,498
Lou!

932
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:55,175
Lou!

933
01:03:55,177 --> 01:03:56,943
Lou!
Aah! Aah!

934
01:03:56,945 --> 01:03:57,944
Fred!

935
01:03:57,946 --> 01:03:59,179
Go!

936
01:03:59,181 --> 01:04:00,883
- Oh, shit!
- Fred, come on.

937
01:04:04,987 --> 01:04:06,219
Give me that leg.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

938
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,021
All right.
Come on.

939
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:10,324
Come on.

940
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:12,092
- All right. Oh, shit.
- Come on. Set him down.

941
01:04:12,094 --> 01:04:13,561
- Set him down.
- All right. Let me go.

942
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:15,396
There you go.

943
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:19,333
Can we get a...
Can we get a...

944
01:04:21,036 --> 01:04:23,003
There you go.
There you go.

945
01:04:23,005 --> 01:04:24,938
Hey, give me that.

946
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,973
Here. Make that.
Okay?

947
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:30,578
- There we go.
- Ow!

948
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:33,113
- Shit.
- It's all right.

949
01:04:33,115 --> 01:04:34,482
Hey!

950
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:38,985
Fucking Lou.

951
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:55,337
Doug?

952
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:58,439
Doug, talk to me, man.

953
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:00,410
Oh, shit.

954
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:05,147
He's dead.

955
01:05:11,688 --> 01:05:14,156
Call in the 92 Mikes.

956
01:05:18,327 --> 01:05:19,895
Watch yourself. Watch yourself.

957
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:32,172
I'll tell you what.

958
01:05:32,174 --> 01:05:36,679
If I'm gonna, uh,
go into the abyss...

959
01:05:38,013 --> 01:05:40,383
...just as soon go out
on a buzz.

960
01:05:47,424 --> 01:05:50,058
I'll see you down the road,
brother.

961
01:05:56,265 --> 01:05:58,133
Fuckin' Lou.

962
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:01,602
Fuckin' moron.

963
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:04,271
What the fuck was that about?

964
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:08,043
It's done, man.

965
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,085
Ain't over till it's over.

966
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,688
Ain't over till it's over.

967
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,423
Shit!

968
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:23,359
Fuck.

969
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:33,568
- Hey.
- This is bullshit.

970
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:35,369
You're bullshit.

971
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:37,672
I want to live.
We all want to fuckin' life.

972
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:39,373
We need you together, not drunk.

973
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:42,612
This is about as together
as I'm gonna get, all right?

974
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:46,447
Don't give up now.

975
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:48,248
- Look.
- Come on.

976
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,452
I'm sorry.
I... I don't know what to do.

977
01:06:51,454 --> 01:06:53,021
We're done.

978
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:56,457
You had ways out.

979
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:58,359
You did.

980
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,293
But you chose to fight.

981
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:02,095
You asked for this fight.

982
01:07:02,097 --> 01:07:03,831
And your friends,
they followed you

983
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,668
because they believed in you.

984
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,471
But now...

985
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:11,472
Now you're just a pussy.

986
01:07:11,474 --> 01:07:13,574
Some mouth you got on you.

987
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:14,575
You know that?

988
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:17,312
Did you get that
from your dead sister, too? Huh?

989
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:21,314
You want to drink yourself
to death?

990
01:07:21,316 --> 01:07:23,018
Go right a-fuckin'-head.

991
01:07:56,853 --> 01:07:58,086
All right.

992
01:07:58,588 --> 01:08:00,790
Fire it up.

993
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:08,297
We move without him.

994
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,898
I don't like it any more
than you do,

995
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,198
but getting home
is the priority.

996
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,536
"We"?
Who put you in charge?

997
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:18,472
If you don't have a better idea,
Walter, shut the fuck up.

998
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:21,442
Hey, assholes,
you're not helping anything.

999
01:08:21,444 --> 01:08:23,511
Well, have you got an idea?

1000
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:25,813
'Cause we could sure as hell use
a light-bulb moment

1001
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:27,247
right about now, lady.

1002
01:08:35,692 --> 01:08:37,491
It's for you that we're doing
all of this.

1003
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:39,326
Hey, I never asked
for your goddamn help, Gramps.

1004
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:40,728
You didn't have to!

1005
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,430
That's the point!

1006
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,230
The second you walked through
that door,

1007
01:08:44,232 --> 01:08:46,400
we were duty-bound to help you!

1008
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:47,568
Of course, you'd never get that

1009
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,637
through your thick
fuckin' skull.

1010
01:08:49,639 --> 01:08:51,939
I'm supposed to be
at the titty bar right now.

1011
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:55,409
You know, great big silicone
melons right in my fuckin' face!

1012
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:57,445
Yeah. Sorry to ruin
your big fuckin' evening.

1013
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,279
Well, sorry don't feed
the bulldog, boy.

1014
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:01,247
Hey, ladies, I hate to interrupt

1015
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:02,516
your party-planning session
right now,

1016
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,317
but we got more urgent matters
to tend to.

1017
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,320
Damn it! All the shit
I've been through in my life!

1018
01:09:07,322 --> 01:09:09,457
I'm gonna be put tits up
by a bunch of goddamn junkies!

1019
01:09:09,459 --> 01:09:10,658
Fuckin' chill out...

1020
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,529
Oh, shut up, all of you!

1021
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:31,814
Let's go.

1022
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:38,186
Why not?

1023
01:09:55,303 --> 01:09:58,708
Oh, is that you, Mr. Fred?

1024
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:02,510
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

1025
01:10:02,512 --> 01:10:06,312
I know hindsight's 20/20,
but...

1026
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:09,752
...you should have dealt
for him.

1027
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:13,454
You know,
inside that little hole,

1028
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:16,757
I can see just a small bit
of you.

1029
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:19,294
But I know what's in there.

1030
01:10:20,363 --> 01:10:26,767
You regretting every single
decision you've made today.

1031
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:30,305
You've got it all wrong, son.
I don't regret a thing.

1032
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:33,641
I lost my friends.

1033
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:35,310
Well, that's not right.

1034
01:10:36,311 --> 01:10:37,411
You took my friends.

1035
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:41,617
But I guess they knew
what they signed up for now.

1036
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,419
I don't regret a goddamn thing.

1037
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:48,656
Matter of fact...

1038
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:51,759
right about now,
I'm feeling real eager.

1039
01:10:51,761 --> 01:10:54,395
So whatever you're gonna do,

1040
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:57,297
quit flapping your gums
and do it.

1041
01:10:57,299 --> 01:11:01,969
But when you come, boy,
you come sharp,

1042
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:04,339
'cause you make a mistake...

1043
01:11:07,844 --> 01:11:10,245
...I'm gonna cut your heart out.

1044
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,086
- Fred, that lamp propane.
- Yeah.

1045
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:19,954
It's gonna blow.

1046
01:11:19,956 --> 01:11:21,822
We'd better hunker down.
Don't you think?

1047
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,960
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Dead Eye.

1048
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:25,995
You know how to waltz?

1049
01:11:26,729 --> 01:11:28,696
Waltz?

1050
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:31,567
'Cause I'm gonna need you
to follow my lead.

1051
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:35,603
He's back.

1052
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:48,482
This ain't gonna be enough.

1053
01:11:48,484 --> 01:11:52,086
A victory is not a victory
if everybody dies.

1054
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:53,356
Not in my mind.

1055
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,827
It's been a real honor serving
with you men.

1056
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:00,963
A real honor.

1057
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:04,799
Hey!

1058
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:05,666
- Jesus!
- Hey!

1059
01:12:05,668 --> 01:12:07,904
Holy Christ.

1060
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:10,471
Come on.

1061
01:12:10,473 --> 01:12:13,374
Hunker down. Come on.
Come on.

1062
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:16,377
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, old man.
Look at me. Look at me.

1063
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:17,711
Hey.

1064
01:12:25,788 --> 01:12:27,757
Move it, Fred.

1065
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,627
I'm taking point this time.
Move it!

1066
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:42,405
Come on, Fred.
Come on.

1067
01:12:46,843 --> 01:12:50,546
Let's see what all this rumblin'
is about.

1068
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:55,451
Come on, ladies!

1069
01:12:57,453 --> 01:12:59,522
I got something for you.

1070
01:14:14,797 --> 01:14:16,964
Hello, friend.

1071
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:20,968
Perhaps now we can finally
be civil.

1072
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:25,105
You killed three of my friends.
That's not civil.

1073
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:27,675
Oh. Well, that was just
a misunderstanding.

1074
01:14:27,677 --> 01:14:32,581
You're all... or <i>were...</i>
soldiers, right?

1075
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:35,983
This whole place was built
on murder.

1076
01:14:35,985 --> 01:14:37,851
No.

1077
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:41,188
Well, I suppose murder
<i>is</i> subjective.

1078
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,123
Not really.

1079
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:48,228
You enjoy it, don't you...
the killing?

1080
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:52,032
Well, I got to admit...

1081
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:56,472
I did get kind of a charge
out of...

1082
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:00,076
...blowing your brother's
fucking head off.

1083
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:10,920
Give me the bag now...

1084
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:16,957
...and I promise you all...
a quick death.

1085
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:19,560
Or we'll just take it from you,

1086
01:15:19,562 --> 01:15:21,662
and you'll all die
very, very slowly.

1087
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:26,202
You last so you can watch
Lizard die.

1088
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:51,027
Okay.

1089
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:53,162
You win.

1090
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:27,129
Get off me, you fuckin' animals!

1091
01:16:56,826 --> 01:16:58,992
Hey!

1092
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:00,994
- Come on!
- Get out, Fred.

1093
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:03,030
I can handle these assholes.

1094
01:17:03,032 --> 01:17:04,932
Nobody's gonna take this ridge!

1095
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:06,367
- Look what I found.
- Jesus Christ.

1096
01:17:06,369 --> 01:17:07,535
Abe!

1097
01:17:07,537 --> 01:17:10,371
They're gonna feel the might
of the American military!

1098
01:17:12,274 --> 01:17:13,273
All right.

1099
01:17:15,878 --> 01:17:18,446
Hey! Look out, kid!
I got this!

1100
01:17:18,448 --> 01:17:20,080
Yeah!

1101
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:43,639
So you're the bitch
that killed Z, right?

1102
01:17:44,173 --> 01:17:46,041
Oh, that's real scary shit.

1103
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:54,248
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to steal?!

1104
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,416
Ow!
Fuck you!

1105
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:05,225
Come on.

1106
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:06,293
- Come on.
- I'm good.

1107
01:18:06,295 --> 01:18:07,364
I'm good. I'm good!
Go on!

1108
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:11,499
Fred, come on!

1109
01:18:11,501 --> 01:18:13,767
- Hey, where's the girl?
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

1110
01:18:13,769 --> 01:18:15,169
God damn it.
She was here.

1111
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:16,504
No!
You can't go back for her!

1112
01:18:16,506 --> 01:18:18,473
You look out for Walter.

1113
01:18:18,475 --> 01:18:20,007
- You empty?
- Yeah.

1114
01:18:20,009 --> 01:18:22,109
Okay. Take that.
I'm sick of the damn thing.

1115
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:23,844
- All right!
- I'll catch up. I'll catch up.

1116
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:25,881
Shit.

1117
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:40,060
They slashed his tires.

1118
01:18:40,062 --> 01:18:41,462
Oh, shit.

1119
01:18:41,464 --> 01:18:44,333
The deuce-and-a-half.
Now.

1120
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:47,470
- Will it run?
- It will if I tell it to.

1121
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:51,140
No!
Let me go!

1122
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:53,907
Oh, shit.

1123
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:30,079
Are you ready to die...
old man?

1124
01:19:57,339 --> 01:20:00,274
Good shit.
Thanks. Thanks. Yeah.

1125
01:20:00,276 --> 01:20:02,109
I had the bitch, though.

1126
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:04,911
Come on.

1127
01:20:10,487 --> 01:20:11,486
Hey, Walter?

1128
01:20:11,488 --> 01:20:13,086
- Huh?
- This thing got any ammo?

1129
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:15,590
The .50-cal?
No.

1130
01:20:21,498 --> 01:20:24,197
- Walter, hurry up!
- Come on.

1131
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:25,433
What's taking so long?

1132
01:20:25,435 --> 01:20:27,468
Goddamn impatient millennials!

1133
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,607
You know something, Fred?

1134
01:20:32,609 --> 01:20:34,609
What's that?

1135
01:20:34,611 --> 01:20:36,544
I like this place.

1136
01:20:38,515 --> 01:20:40,417
I'm glad to hear that.

1137
01:20:43,553 --> 01:20:45,420
Turn around.

1138
01:20:45,422 --> 01:20:47,122
Give me that.

1139
01:20:49,426 --> 01:20:52,025
Fred!

1140
01:20:52,027 --> 01:20:53,363
Shit.

1141
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:59,434
I'll be back.

1142
01:21:01,337 --> 01:21:03,970
Walter!
Hurry the fuck up!

1143
01:21:03,972 --> 01:21:07,109
Did you ever try to pee with
somebody watching you like that?

1144
01:21:12,549 --> 01:21:14,247
Come on, baby.

1145
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:16,316
Aah!

1146
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:19,589
Shawn!

1147
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:28,596
Shawn!

1148
01:21:28,598 --> 01:21:30,330
Fuck!

1149
01:21:30,332 --> 01:21:31,599
Shawn!

1150
01:21:31,601 --> 01:21:33,033
Shawn!

1151
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:35,304
Aah!

1152
01:21:39,476 --> 01:21:43,145
Aah! Aah!

1153
01:21:56,593 --> 01:21:58,225
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- Oh, shit.

1154
01:21:58,227 --> 01:22:00,160
- Oh...
- Hey, you with me?

1155
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:03,398
Yeah. I've had better days.

1156
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,298
Oh, fuck.

1157
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,000
That looks like it's gonna
do it, doesn't it?

1158
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:09,604
No, sir. No, sir. Move over.
I'm getting us out of here.

1159
01:22:09,606 --> 01:22:11,472
Not on your life.

1160
01:22:11,474 --> 01:22:14,076
Where's Fred?

1161
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:19,179
Oh.
Look at that son of a bitch.

1162
01:22:19,181 --> 01:22:21,014
He's slower than quail shit.

1163
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:23,751
No! Fuck you!

1164
01:22:26,356 --> 01:22:28,658
Shoot.

1165
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,701
Shoot.

1166
01:22:40,703 --> 01:22:43,336
Take peace in this, kid...

1167
01:22:43,338 --> 01:22:46,308
You and your sister
were only separated by...

1168
01:22:50,413 --> 01:22:52,647
I ain't gonna make it, kid.

1169
01:22:52,649 --> 01:22:55,115
I know that.

1170
01:22:55,117 --> 01:22:57,050
This is the end of the line.

1171
01:22:57,052 --> 01:23:01,089
You're a good kid,
and you're a good soldier.

1172
01:23:02,492 --> 01:23:06,161
Now, you go home and take care
of that wife of yours.

1173
01:23:06,763 --> 01:23:08,230
That's an order.

1174
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:11,164
I got this.

1175
01:23:20,376 --> 01:23:22,110
We're not done.

1176
01:23:22,779 --> 01:23:26,683
No.
No, I suppose we're not.

1177
01:23:30,085 --> 01:23:31,521
Well, Mr. Fred...

1178
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:37,125
...I believe we have
ourselves... a situation.

1179
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,436
Come on, baby. Come on!

1180
01:23:48,438 --> 01:23:50,438
Yes!

1181
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,074
Yes!

1182
01:23:52,609 --> 01:23:54,675
Hey, Fred!

1183
01:23:54,677 --> 01:23:59,214
This is the last goddamn time
I'm gonna bail your ass out!

1184
01:23:59,716 --> 01:24:01,849
Hyah!

1185
01:24:56,472 --> 01:24:58,506
You in one piece?

1186
01:24:58,508 --> 01:25:00,577
Yeah, just about.

1187
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:07,082
You two all right?

1188
01:25:09,385 --> 01:25:10,885
Walter?

1189
01:25:10,887 --> 01:25:13,621
One of those punks got him
real good.

1190
01:25:13,623 --> 01:25:15,458
He wasn't gonna make it.

1191
01:25:16,759 --> 01:25:19,360
God damn, Walter.

1192
01:25:19,362 --> 01:25:21,364
You old fool.

1193
01:25:22,799 --> 01:25:24,400
Hey, Fred?

1194
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:34,775
Ranger, I think it's about time
we had one beer for the road.

1195
01:25:34,777 --> 01:25:36,846
You're a real bastard.
You know that?

1196
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:48,556
You got it?

1197
01:25:48,558 --> 01:25:50,256
Yeah, I got it.

1198
01:25:52,829 --> 01:25:54,196
Abe!

1199
01:25:55,431 --> 01:25:56,764
Hey.

1200
01:25:59,836 --> 01:26:01,638
Hey, Abe.

1201
01:26:20,723 --> 01:26:24,425
Well, at least he died
doing something he liked to do.

1202
01:26:24,427 --> 01:26:26,827
Who the fuck said I was dead?

1203
01:26:26,829 --> 01:26:27,928
- Fuck!
- Jesus.

1204
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:29,666
Don't do that.

1205
01:26:43,813 --> 01:26:45,513
Doug.

1206
01:26:45,515 --> 01:26:46,949
Z.

1207
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:48,918
Lou.

1208
01:26:51,253 --> 01:26:52,553
Walter.

1209
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:54,189
And Lucy.

1210
01:26:59,896 --> 01:27:01,497
And Abe.

1211
01:27:16,646 --> 01:27:19,214
Well, shit.

1212
01:27:20,016 --> 01:27:21,882
What do you figure
this is worth?

1213
01:27:21,884 --> 01:27:24,018
A whole lot.

1214
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,856
Enough to fix the place up
and more.

1215
01:27:33,328 --> 01:27:35,898
Happy birthday, old man.

1216
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:41,961
