d Let's roll,
so roll motherfuckers... d

185
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,165
Hey, Dad...

186
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,249
...make a wish.

187
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,999
My wish was for you anyway.

188
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,207
I wished for you too.

189
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,290
Who looks prettier?

190
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,207
Me or Bright Eyes?

191
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,624
You both look pretty.

192
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,124
What's the matter Bright Eyes,
you're not hungry?

193
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,999
Better not get too skinny...

194
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,624
...or Daddy won't like you any more,
will you, Daddy?

195
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,457
What are you looking at?

196
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,415
Do you want some?

197
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:13,749
d Open up for the aeroplane d

198
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,332
Is it finger licking good?

199
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,999
Is...it...

200
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,624
...finger...licking...

201
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,832
...GOOD?

202
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:33,957
Is it finger licking good?

203
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,040
Show me.

204
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,415
Toi...

205
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,999
What?

206
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,457
Toilet.

207
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,624
Toilet?

208
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,540
Not till you show me.

209
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,040
Show me!

210
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,415
Suck it.

211
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,249
Still need to go?

212
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,832
Ones or twos?

213
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,290
Ones?

214
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,499
Yeah?

215
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,415
Go.

216
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,249
Were you telling porky pies?

217
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,665
Bring the hammer, Daddy.

218
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,040
I killed your dog with this.

219
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,499
And a nail.

220
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:20,540
You've got 1 0 seconds to go
or Daddy's going to nail it to the chair.

221
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,749
One.

222
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,457
Two.

223
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,832
Three.

224
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,457
Four.

225
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,332
Five.

226
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,624
Six.

227
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,124
Seven.

228
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,999
Eight.

229
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,832
Nine.

230
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,082
It's crying.

231
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,957
I bet I kiss it better.

232
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:20,832
Or maybe I'll bite it off
so she can never kiss it again.

233
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,832
Princess!

234
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,582
- Oh! What happened?
- Where's Bright Eyes?

235
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:31,124
She's in her room
so she can't get out.

236
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,124
Where is he?

237
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:35,915
There he is!

238
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,124
Keep it on him.

239
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,499
Here, let me have a go.

240
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,040
Boys shouldn't hit girls.

241
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,415
Cry.

242
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,207
Cry!

243
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:48,749
Cry!

244
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,874
This one's for the Kingswood.

245
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,415
Here you are.

246
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,665
Thanks, Holly.

247
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,665
He thinks I blame him.

248
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,540
Do you?

249
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,165
That's me.

250
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,790
Oh... Keir Willis.

251
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,290
He was such a baby.

252
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,415
That's me again.

253
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,582
Duncan Fletcher.

254
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,457
He wet himself.

255
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,957
It was so funny.

256
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,707
See?

257
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,290
He wet his pants.

258
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,999
Rhys Agnew.

259
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,624
Boring!

260
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:10,457
Here's the one that got away.

261
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,290
Timmy Valentine.

262
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,040
He's probably dead by now.

263
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,124
And lucky last...

264
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,665
Oh!

265
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,040
I'm ready to draw on him now.

266
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,207
Shall we go in after this?

267
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,207
Sick of me already?

268
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,624
No. No, I just thought...

269
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,082
...you know, maybe we should
eat something.

270
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,749
Come here.

271
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,915
I'll feed you.

272
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,499
Your drawing gets better every time.

273
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:07,499
Throw it.

274
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:15,332
Not too much.
It's supposed to be bad for you.

275
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:47,249
We can't hear you!

276
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:51,332
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!

277
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,624
Maybe...
Maybe we should go in.

278
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,832
Oh, here! You all right?

279
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,040
And this year's
Queen of the Dance is...

280
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,207
...Lola Stone!

281
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:09,082
Blow your whistle, King.

282
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,332
Daddy!

283
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,290
Crown me.

284
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:56,082
"Oh, So Lonesome For You")

285
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:19,249
d I've been tried and then tempted

286
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:24,999
d But now I'm leaving today

d Oh, my head in my hands,

00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:11,707
d And my heart inside me is torn

295
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:18,374
d Are you sitting true...

296
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,415

297
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:23,165
d ...we were through

298
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:27,124
d But I'll be oh, so lonesome... d

299
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:31,832
If you want to do that sort of thing
I suggest you go somewhere else.

300
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,415
"Not Pretty Enough")

301
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:48,040

302
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:51,540

d Why do you see...

308
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,332
When I find my Prince,

309
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:15,707
this is the song we're gonna dance to
at my wedding.

310
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:19,415
d I live, I breathe

311
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,707

313
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,124
But you're not him.

314
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,999
You're just another FROG!

319
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,999

You're the Prince.

331
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:53,832
That's why I can't find one I like.

332
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:00,749
It's always been you, Daddy.

333
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:06,165
Just you and me...

334
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,915
d Don't I make you laugh?

335
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:15,999

right through me?

d Why do you... d

338
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,374
Thanks.

339
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,249
I contacted Search & Rescue.
They'll be here in the morning.

340
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:43,499
But if you think of anything
or you need me, you ring me.

341
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,999
We'll find him.

342
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,874
'The person you are calling
is unavailable.'

343
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,624
'Leave a message after the tone.'

344
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:12,624
Hi Mum, I think it's late over there
so you're probably asleep.

345
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,790
So er...

346
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:17,332
I'll try again later.

347
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,332
OK, bye.

348
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:45,165
Catch!

349
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:17,332
Drinkie, drinkie..
 Sing for your supper.

350
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:22,207
Not loud enough.

351
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,707
d She's a lost cause,
she's a lost, lost cause... d

352
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,582
Fuck me.

353
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

354
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:27,415
When I said go somewhere else
I meant off school property.

355
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,999
You're my first drilling.

356
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,207
The trick is not to go too far.

357
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,249
Just enough
to break through the skull.

358
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:06,624
- Do you know how to turn it on?
- I'm not stupid.

359
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,915
Remove the King's crown,
please, Daddy.

360
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,290
You've got to push harder.

361
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,290
Two hands.

362
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,749
Cradle it into the body.

363
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:08,749
That's the way.

364
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,040
Stop!

365
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,665
Perfect.

366
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:36,540
It works, you know.

367
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:41,415
It boils your brains
and turns you into one of them.

368
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:51,165
Careful, it's hot.

369
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,540
Sorry!

370
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,874
You've got to give it a bigger tip.

371
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:47,124
The hole's too small,
can you please make it bigger?

372
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,415
Daddy?

373
01:00:45,833 --> 01:02:24,749
Daddy!

374
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:53,499
Daddy.

375
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:29,582
OK. You all right??
 Mmm.

376
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:33,249
All right.
Now, we've just got two steps.

377
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:11,499
Must've danced her off her feet.

378
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:23,415
Why can't you find him?

379
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,332
- Is she all right?
- Yeah.

380
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,957
Good night, Mummy.

381
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:46,040
'Lola Stone.
That's who asked me.'

382
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:13,624
Hello?

383
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:33,707
I'm going to your house now.

384
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,624
I'm going to stab your mummy
in the neck,

385
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,999
just like you did to my daddy.

386
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:51,082
And then I'm going to stab Holly
in the heart.

387
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:54,499
Just like you did to me.

388
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:02,207
d Am I not pretty enough?

389
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:07,999
d Is my heart too broken?

390
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:13,749
d Do I cry too much?

391
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:19,707
d Am I too outspoken?

392
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:25,290
d Don't I make you laugh?

393
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:31,332
d Should I try harder?
