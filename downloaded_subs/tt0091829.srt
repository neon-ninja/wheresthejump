1
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,640
All right, haul away.

2
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,273
Come on. Come on.

3
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,421
Damn it.

4
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,800
- Go on!
- Any time!

5
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,386
Go on!

6
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,305
It's no bloody good!

7
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,601
Turn it off!

8
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,569
Yeah. Go on.

9
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,200

It's not goin' to move, Garron.

23
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,582
Dennis is right. Give up.

24
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,668
Maybe.

25
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,631
Doesn't look too healthy.

26
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,345
Well, I'd better be gettin' back.

27
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,973
Me dinner's on the table.

28
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,143
Thanks anyway.

29
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,231
Are you comin', Mitch?

30
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,234
Yeah. Good luck.

31
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,045
May the same dinner choke ya.

32
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:05,806
Hey, Dad.

33
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,977
Smile.

34
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,186
Dad!

35
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:13,939
What's the problem?

36
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,776
Mom says it's gonna rain. Why don't you
stop taking the damn photographs?

37
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,281
- Damn photographs?
- Just quoting.

38
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,074
Oh. Just quoting.

39
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,993
I see.

40
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,870
Well, what would <i>you</i> say?

41
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,997
I'd say I'm hungry.

42
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,249
What an entirely new response from you.

43
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,836
All right, listen, tell her...

44
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,631
- Tell her about ten minutes. Okay?
- She's mad with you.

45
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,633
All right. Tell her five.

46
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,844
I have to see somebody about this site.

47
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,221
Then can we go home? I'm bored.

48
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,641
Robbie, how can you be bored? This is
the land of your forefathers. Remember?

49
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,435
Yeah, and they left.

50
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,563
Tell her five minutes.

51
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,610
Tell her I really mean it.

52
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,476
Bastard.

Hi.

58
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,242
- We should get you home.
- I don't know what came over me.

59
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,328
Shall we make a dash for it?

60
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,163
I felt like I was burning.

61
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,332
Come on.

62
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,401
Can I help you?

63
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,573
Yeah, I hope so.
I'm looking for a Reverend Coot.

64
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,284
Am I saying that right? Coot?

65
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:39,288
That's right. But I'm not your man.
I'm the verger.

66
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,540
Oh. Hi. I'm Howard Hallenbeck.

67
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,001
Declan O'Brien.

68
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,796
Tell me something. This Coot,
he wouldn't happen to be old, would he?

69
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,135
Sorry.

70
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,264
I talked to him a couple weeks ago.
He said that I might look at the church.

71
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,724
I see.

72
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,561
You see, it's for a book I'm writing.

73
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,439
He said I might take some photographs,

74
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,442
maybe even look at the parish records.

75
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,777
Then you'd probably find him
in the rectory.

76
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,905
Which is where?

77
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,116
Out the door.

78
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,244
Turn right,
and it's straight ahead of you.

79
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,665
Right, then straight.

80
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,709
Thanks.

81
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,809
All right.

82
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,354
One, two, three.

83
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,203
Rawhead.

84
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,789
- Come in. Come in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

85
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:31,001
Look at this. A striking collection.

86
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,961
Well, it passes the time.

87
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,592
- Here. Let me take your coat.
- Thank you very much.

88
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,135
This is very nice.

89
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,430
Well, now, how can I help?

90
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,516
Well, when we spoke on the phone
I think I mentioned

91
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,185
that the book that I'm writing

92
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:52,481
is about the persistence of sacred sites
in this part of the country.

93
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,524
I'm sorry. Persistence?

94
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,943
Yeah, see,

95
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,197
a lot of churches are built on sites
that have been considered sacred

96
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,074
for, well, some considerable time.

97
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,368
Pre-Christian, you mean.

98
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,536
Pre-Roman, even.

99
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,705
Although that doesn't apply
here in Ireland.

100
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,208
What I'm after are neolithic sites.

101
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,585
Fertility cults of one sort or the other.

102
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,461
Here?

103
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,589
It's very possible, yeah.

104
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,634
Intriguing.

105
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,678
What I'd like to do is photograph
the interior of your church,

106
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,889
particularly those stained glass windows.

107
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,766
Very interesting designs.

108
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,559
Of course. It's always open.

109
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,271
How about your parish records?
Could I have a look at those?

110
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,899
I'm sure it can be arranged.

111
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,443
I'll have Declan look out
whatever stuff we've got.

112
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,612
Ah, yes, the verger.

113
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:45,492
Perhaps I'd better come back to you
when he's sorted it all out.

114
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,202
That'd be much appreciated.

115
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:48,995
Where are you staying?

116
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,123
At your pub.

117
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,792
The Tall Man?

118
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,919
<i>The Tall Man.</i>

119
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,424
Once upon a time there was a little boy
called Treehorn.

120
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,346
He just noticed that...

121
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,181
Shut up!

122
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,270
Watch it!
I'm trying to read my comic!

123
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,355
- Watch it.
- You're a pig, Robbie.

124
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,773
Oh, yeah, sure.

125
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,820
Two more days of this, I'll go nuts.

126
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,823
What are you talking about?
We just checked in here.

127
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,449
We've been here two months.

128
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,495
Well, we've been in Ireland
a month and a half, actually... not quite.

129
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,416
We may not have to be here that long.
I've gotta see the records of this church.

130
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,585
This is the most interesting site
I've seen.

131
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,379
- And then?
- Then we can go to Dublin.

132
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,381
It's about half a day's drive.

133
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,426
Come on, get it. Just get it!

134
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,970
- I want my doll!
- Well, you're not getting it.

135
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,598
I will. I'll go bananas.

136
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,308
All right, quiet down!

137
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,895
This is a working trip for me.
Remember?

138
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,771
You know, you also got a family.

139
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,817
That's who those kids belong to.
I was wondering.

140
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,449
I thought you'd feel at home here.

141
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,286
- "At home."
- Irish forebearers and all that.

142
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,914
It's a vicious rumor put out by my mother.

143
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,499
Your mother <i>is</i> a vicious rumor.

144
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,758
One more day?

145
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,421
- Dennis.
- What?

146
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,840
Dear, the door's not shut.

147
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,927
- I locked it.
- Well, it's open now.

148
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,359
Damn. I could have sworn
that I bolted it.

149
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,486
Who's there?

150
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,292
Who's there?

151
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,771
I said, who's there?

152
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,723
Dennis! Dennis!

153
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,188
No. No!

154
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,194
No! Get away!

155
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,125
Dennis! Oh, Dennis!

156
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,545
- Did you hear that?
- You're changing the subject.

157
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,630
Listen.

158
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,301
It's just more thunder, I think.

159
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,015
Why did we have to come here
in the monsoon season?

160
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:11,145
I like this place. I think I could
live here. It's quiet, it's charming.

161
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,272
And dead.

162
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,567
What do you expect from a historian?
I prefer dead things.

163
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,528
Oh. I'll bear that in mind.

164
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,406
With one or two exceptions.

165
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,573
Name one.

166
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,874
What's the other?

167
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,221
You haven't kissed me like that
in a long time.

168
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,684
You have very dirty eyes.
Anybody ever tell you that?

169
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,894
Practically everybody.

170
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,084
She'll certainly know us next time.

171
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,629
- Strange.
- Yeah.

172
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,716
The way she looked.

173
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,926
What do you mean?

174
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,262
She reminds me of something.

175
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,431
Somebody.

176
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,684
Maybe she's a relation of yours.

177
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,356
- You're right. You're going bananas.
- Thanks.

178
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,858
- Now, about that hotel.
- Yeah?

179
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,662
What the hell?

180
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,051
Dennis. Jenny.

181
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,011
Are you there?

182
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:06,946
Dennis.

183
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,114
Dennis!

184
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,724
Dennis. Jenny?

185
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,398
Jen, what happened here?

186
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,089
Would you take over here?
I'm wanted. All right?

187
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,218
Just a moment.
Could I have a word?

188
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,679
Travel with her in the ambulance.
Take down anything she says.

189
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,723
You understand? It's very important.

190
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,142
Any little mumbled phrase.
Anything at all.

191
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,862
I went into the kitchen.

192
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,953
There wasn't a mark on Jenny.

193
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,790
Which leaves the husband.

194
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,041
Dennis.

195
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,961
Did they have any visitors
staying with them?

196
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,381
I don't think so.
I could check.

197
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,968
What amazes me is
how the woman survived.

198
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,721
Clearly, she hid herself.

199
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,307
A wardrobe, perhaps. The attic.

200
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,854
I don't think Conroy
knows what hit him.

201
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,357
They probably haven't had
a murder round here before.

202
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,487
You're assuming Nicholson's dead.

203
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,615
The state of the house. The blood.

204
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,659
Yes, I think so.

205
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,538
I think we're talking about
some kind of revenge killing.

206
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,542
Doesn't seem to go with the territory.

207
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,876
I don't know.

208
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,753
Resentments can fester anywhere.

209
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,716
We're looking for several individuals
to have caused this kind of damage.

210
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,235
- Howard?
- Yeah, I'm right here. I'm here.

211
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,530
- Something wrong?
- No, it's just...

212
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,033
- You didn't hear the sirens?
- Sirens?

213
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,870
Just an accident of some sort
up in the hills.

214
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,664
Come back to bed.

215
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:08,294
I'm gonna take a walk, get some air.
Help me go to sleep.

216
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,424
You know, you were talking in your sleep.

217
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,967
Was I?

218
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,802
Who the hell is Big Jake?

219
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,515
Wouldn't you like to know.

220
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,730
Keep it warm, okay?

221
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,982
I'll be back.

222
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,610
Big Jake.

223
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,364
Hey, take your coat.

224
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,743
It's cold out there.

225
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,948
- Why don't you watch the film?
- Seen it.

226
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,201
- Well, then change the channel.
- I've seen them all.

227
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,505
- You're just being selfish.
- Don't, Andy.

228
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,090
You're a selfish little brat.

229
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,643
Come on. Come on.

230
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,271
He can watch the telly.

231
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,606
You'll be sorry for this.
I'm gonna get you back, dickhead.

232
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,067
You and whose army?

233
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,277
You little pig.

234
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:58,779
Just you wait.

235
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,410
It's not very warm.

236
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,328
You're a little bastard.

237
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,251
- Hey! Give me that!
- No, you don't! Get lost!

238
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,134
- Come on.
- Andy.

239
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,595
I have to talk to you.

240
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,180
Sure.

241
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,223
No, I mean seriously.

242
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,851
I can talk seriously, you know.
Come on. We'll walk.

243
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,522
Let me out, you pig!

244
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,776
Come on.

245
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,128
Andy!

246
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,865
Pig! The bloody pig!

247
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,628
I tell you what. I'm gonna kill
the little brat one of these days.

248
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:41,382
- I don't think this was such a good idea.
- Why not? There's nobody around.

249
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,467
- Are you feeling a bit cold?
- Yeah.

250
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,135
Come on. I'll warm ya up.

251
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:50,808
No, Andy.

252
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,351
Oh, come on, Katrina.

253
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,103
You said we could talk.

254
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,448
Did you hear that?

255
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,325
No.

256
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,374
Oh, God.

257
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,759
My God. Neil. Sean?

258
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,178
Sean!

259
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,099
Sean! It's little Neil.

260
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,103
Damn.

261
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,069
My God. What's happened?

262
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:11,115
- What's wrong, sweetheart?
- What is it, son?

263
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,618
Speak up. What is it?

264
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,831
What's happened?

265
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,587
There's somebody here, Andy.

266
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,798
Hey, listen.

267
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,884
Stop playing hard-to-get, will ya?

268
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,431
- I wanna go back to the caravan.
- We'll go back in a minute.

269
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,766
God!

270
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,227
I said I want to go back.

271
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,357
Shit.

272
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,617
What the hell's goin' on?

273
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,161
God knows.

274
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:00,539
- The boy just appeared on the doorstep.
- He won't say a word.

275
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,127
Hey, Katrina.
Katrina, hang on, will ya?

276
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,589
Here. Listen, I'm sorry.

277
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,008
- Hey, you're not upset, are ya?
- I'm not. It's just...

278
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,220
I'm just feeling chilly. That's all.

279
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,889
You poor little baby.

280
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,770
- I'll keep you warm.
- Andy.

281
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,606
There. You getting warmer?

282
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,274
Good.

283
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,950
Run! Come on!

284
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,581
I can't... I can't go...

285
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,167
Come on!

286
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,822
- What is it?
- Something... I don't...

287
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,157
- What is it, for God's sake?
- I don't...

288
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,325
Andy!

289
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,332
- Don't get too far apart.
- No.

290
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,210
And stay in sight of each other.

291
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,300
Let's go see.

292
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,554
He'll be back in a second.

293
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,680
Okay.

294
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,936
- What's happening out there?
- Something going on up in the hills.

295
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,145
We were worried.

296
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,814
Is that why you're still up?

297
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,651
Is it an accident?

298
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,237
- I don't know.
- Was there any blood?

299
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,114
I didn't see, so I don't know.

300
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,826
All right, pumpkin.
All the excitement's over.

301
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,411
- Time for bed.
- Yep.

302
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,749
Now you see Daddy's okay.
Time for beddy-bye.

303
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,626
Okay.

304
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,297
Oh, my God!

305
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,676
- Who is it?
- What the...

306
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,347
Did someone fetch the police?

307
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,183
I'll go back and check.

308
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,728
Who is it?

309
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,690
It's not the Johnson boy.

310
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,150
God knows.

311
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,245
Over here!

312
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,419
Where's his head?

313
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,630
Jesus Christ! It's a bloody massacre!

314
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,593
- There's that no-good brother of yours.
- Boring.

315
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,096
No more comics, Robbie.

316
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,181
- They rot the brain.
- Yeah?

317
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,394
Down to bed, okay?

318
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,813
- Okay.
- And here's Icky.

319
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:35,897
Thank you.

320
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,443
Night-night. Sleep tight.
And don't let the bedbugs bite.

321
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:56,126
- Off we went to have our dinner.
- Just hang on there, gentlemen.

322
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,962
The officer in charge of the case
is arriving just now.

323
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:01,798
- He'd like to ask you a few questions.
- That's all right.

324
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,150
How long's he been dead?

325
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:24,112
I'd estimate under 24 hours.

326
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,158
Apparently he was trying
to move this stone.

327
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,493
Witnesses?

328
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,286
Two local men.

329
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,873
They've been helping him clear the field.
When they left here, he was fine.

330
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:39,127
This is number three.

331
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,176
Do you know what I mean?

332
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,137
- Morning.
- Who's that?

333
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:54,059
Excuse me. I'd like to report
something I saw last night.

334
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,604
- Who do I speak to?
- Just go in. Last door on the right.

335
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,399
- On the right?
- Yeah. That's right.

336
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,776
Any statement's going to be
pure conjecture.

337
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,487
Somebody wants to speak
to the man in charge.

338
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,197
- He'll have to wait.
- Yes, of course.

339
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,992
Would you mind waiting a moment, sir?

340
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,077
I'll get right back to you.

341
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,915
Yes. Promptly, sir.

342
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,336
- Somebody to...
- I heard. Come in.

343
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,923
This is Mr....

344
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,926
Hallenbeck.
Howard Hallenbeck.

345
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,470
Inspector Gissing.
What can I do for you?

346
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,306
Well, I heard about
the murders last night,

347
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,810
and I think maybe I saw something.

348
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,522
- Oh?
- But I'm not exactly sure what.

349
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,109
We're looking for more than
one perpetrator, Mr. Hallenbeck.

350
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,861
What I saw wasn't human.

351
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:48,947
I beg your pardon.

352
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:52,325
At least I don't think it was.

353
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,705
It was very tall.
Much too big to be a man.

354
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,039
How big?

355
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,461
Eight foot, nine foot.

356
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,629
- I really don't have time to...
- I saw this.

357
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,798
Just let me speak. Okay?

358
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,300
I saw it.

359
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,678
And what's more, it saw me.

360
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,889
This... thing...

361
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,724
was watching me.

362
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:20,312
It fixed me with these
mean, burning red eyes.

363
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,985
All right, I know how this sounds.

364
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,528
Believe me, I know.

365
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:30,655
But I saw it.

366
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,742
Was this on the road?

367
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,205
No, no. I was in a road.
It was up a field.

368
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,748
Cattle then. You saw cattle.

369
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,167
I know what cattle look like.
For Christ's sake!

370
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,127
Darkness can be deceptive.

371
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,300
All right, I came here
to tell you something.

372
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,427
I saw something.
I don't know what it is.

373
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,804
But it was there.

374
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:58,183
And it's out there right now.
So what do you want to do?

375
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:02,896
Well, if you want to give a statement
to Officer Conroy here...

376
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,359
Forget it. Just forget it.

377
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,078
Sir, maybe we ought to
look at what he's saying.

378
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,838
Tea?

379
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:32,926
No, none for me. I was wondering
about the parish records.

380
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:38,056
Yes, a curious thing, that. They appear to
have been removed from the premises.

381
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,516
What do you mean? Stolen?

382
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,101
Well, so it seems.

383
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,271
Though I frankly can't see why.

384
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,151
Again, I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

385
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,444
Thanks anyway.

386
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:52,862
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

387
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,043
All right, there it is.

388
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,379
Strangest thing.

389
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:24,102
All right, handsome. Smile.

390
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,358
Death...

391
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,319
walks...

392
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,156
Fearing what?
Death walks...

393
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,533
Death goes in... Fear...

394
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,536
Itself...

395
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,165
never became.

396
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,294
Death goes in fear...

397
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,339
of what it cannot be.

398
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,100
Goes in fear...

399
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,773
of what it cannot be.

400
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,445
Sorry. I'm sorry.

401
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,782
Oh, dear.

402
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,828
- What did you do that for?
- Get the fuck outta here.

403
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,789
There's nothing here for you.

404
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,624
You fucking...

405
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,839
Yeah, I'll get the fuck out of here,

406
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:36,966
and you be very fucking glad.

407
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,054
That's a little present for you,

408
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,972
you goddamn maniac.

409
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,112
Finally.
God, it took you long enough.

410
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:01,825
Well, checking out
is always a major adventure.

411
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,451
All right.

412
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,496
Now, let's see where we're going.

413
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,710
Okay. Where to, my lady?

414
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,212
Well, I's having trouble
reading the map.

415
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,924
How surprising. Your mother's
having trouble reading a map.

416
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,052
I see. Daddy's being rude again.

417
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,595
- Rude?
- Rude.

418
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:24,222
- Truthful.
- Rude.

419
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,348
Accurate.

420
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,151
<i>Dublin, oh, Dublin</i>

421
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,112
Yeah.

422
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,199
- Icky.
- Have they got a McDonald's in Dublin?

423
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,410
Probably.

424
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,497
Are we almost there?

425
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,584
No, for the 15th time.

426
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,836
I'm hungry.

427
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,089
You're a bottomless pit, Robbie.

428
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,552
What's a bottomless pit?

429
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,055
My God.

430
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,558
What? What is it?

431
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,770
There's something there
back in the field.

432
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,691
Do you wanna go back and see?

433
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,068
Okay.

434
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,449
What's a bottomless pit?

435
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,992
Why are we going back?

436
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,203
Your mother thinks she saw something.

437
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,751
It's a scarecrow.

438
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,546
- Yes.
- What did you think it was?

439
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:44,594
I don't know. It's this bloody place.

440
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:50,141
Bloody place, huh?
You're sounding more Irish every day.

441
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:51,601
It's time we move on.

442
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,854
Drive, madam?

443
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,773
Please.

444
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,442
You guys ready to go?

445
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,069
Yeah.

446
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,531
Your enthusiasm overwhelms me.

447
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,091
Sir.

448
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,927
- What?
- We've got something.

449
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,595
The Nicholson woman.

450
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,514
No, sir.
She's still refusing to speak.

451
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,182
There's some kind of trauma apparently.

452
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,726
- What then?
- It's the boy, sir.

453
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,103
Neil Johnson?

454
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,897
- He's talked?
- Not talked exactly.

455
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,274
What then?

456
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,026
Down at the hospital,

457
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:45,280
Conroy was left to look after him
while we spoke with the parents.

458
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,491
The kid wouldn't say a word.
Not a word.

459
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:52,787
So Conroy gave him some stuff
to play with. Paper, pens.

460
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:53,955
And?

461
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,457
And the kid started drawing.

462
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,755
God almighty.

463
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,509
Maybe the Yank was right.

464
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:10,346
Maybe there <i>is</i> something out there.

465
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,189
We have to stop.

466
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:21,774
Why, honey?

467
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:23,943
I gotta pee.

468
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,864
Well, we're not going back.

469
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,825
But I have to.

470
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:34,120
You should have thought
of that before we left.

471
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:36,581
I forgot.

472
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,083
How can you forget?
That's stupid.

473
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,793
Robbie.

474
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:45,757
Okay, it's too far to the next town,
so we're just gonna stop right here.

475
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,849
Okay, wanna go with her?

476
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,976
She's okay on her own.

477
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,478
Go on, Minty.

478
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,355
- Where?
- In the field.

479
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,106
Nobody will see you.

480
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,777
Come on, sweetheart.
We haven't got all day.

481
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,112
I'm gonna go with her.

482
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,239
- She's okay.
- I know, I know.

483
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,283
She's got to grow up
sometime, you know.

484
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,786
But not till I'm good and ready.

485
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,753
You see that big green bush?
You go right behind there, okay?

486
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,505
Hurry up, sweetheart.

487
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,633
- You mustn't look.
- I won't look.

488
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,635
Now, go ahead. Hurry up.

489
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:42,271
Just go on. Go on.
That's right. Go on.

490
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:09,632
Minty!

491
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,771
- It's all over now.
- Oh, my God.

492
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,983
- What happened?
- It's just a rabbit there. It scared her.

493
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,444
All right, you go to Mommy now, okay?

494
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,699
Oh, little baby.

495
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,536
- God, that's ugly.
- Feel all right now?

496
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,038
- Really disgusting.
- You feeling better?

497
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,924
- How's Mommy? Mommy okay now?
- Mommy's okay.

498
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,646
No, it's okay.
Crows are very bad things.

499
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,190
Poor little bunny.

500
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,817
- It's gone to heaven.
- Yeah.

501
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,785
You wanna go back to the car?

502
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,621
Robbie.

503
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,748
Give me a kiss.

504
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,709
Dad! Dad!

505
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,795
Robbie. No. No.

506
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,979
Robbie!

507
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,838
Look, please.

508
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,132
- I have a job to do.
- We all have a job to do.

509
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,134
- Give us a break.
- Fine, okay.

510
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,469
- Just one or two shots, right?
- Here he is now.

511
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,596
Let's get the whole situation.

512
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,932
- Is it true the army's been moved in?
- I have no comment.

513
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,226
Is there any connection
between the murders?

514
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,271
Yes. They're all dead.

515
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,273
Is the army being moved in?

516
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:32,150
Why don't you all
get the hell out of here.

517
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,278
What have you got up there, Detective?
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

518
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,199
Go ahead. Answer the man.
What have you got?

519
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,871
- Look, mister...
- Animal, vegetable or mineral?

520
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,789
- We're doing all we can.
- Too late.

521
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:48,166
Too goddamn late.

522
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,251
Obviously, we'd appreciate
your assistance.

523
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,963
I've given your man here everything.

524
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,966
Every sickening detail.
We've done maps. We've done drawings.

525
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,594
It's the same as what the boy saw, sir.

526
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,597
What in God's name is it?

527
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,724
Of course darkness can be deceptive.

528
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,143
I was wrong. I'll grant you that.

529
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,811
- Thanks.
- Believe me.

530
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:11,564
We're going to find your son's killer.

531
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:15,193
The valley's being searched
by armed officers. We'll find it.

532
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:18,696
I bet it has hiding places you couldn't
even guess at. You wanna know why?

533
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:19,780
Enlighten me.

534
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,533
I think it belongs here.
This is its home.

535
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:24,994
- From way back.
- Then we've got it, haven't we?

536
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,496
If this <i>is</i> his territory, it'll come back,

537
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,248
sooner or later.

538
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,626
All we have to do is wait.

539
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:35,254
Wait? Wait for what?

540
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,716
More of your mistakes?
More slaughter?

541
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,968
Look, Mr. Hallenbeck,
we understand how you feel.

542
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,763
You have no idea how I feel!

543
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:51,395
Your goddamn stupidity
is the reason my son is dead.

544
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,526
Now, do you understand that?

545
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:04,200
Get the goddamn thing myself.

546
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,369
- Look, Hallenbeck...
- Go to hell!

547
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,079
Just go right to hell!

548
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,500
I'm sorry.

549
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:17,338
- I have to go out. I'll be back.
- Okay.

550
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,237
They buried him alive.

551
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,700
- What?
- The devil.

552
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,913
They put him in the earth, deep down.

553
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,667
They thought he'd die, you see.

554
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,336
Thought they could forget about him.

555
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,005
But the dark ones come back.

556
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,466
They always do.

557
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,179
- This window...
- Useless to fight.

558
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,097
- What does it represent?
- Nothing!

559
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,642
- The devil's won.
- Wait a minute.

560
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:55,144
Declan.

561
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,687
See?

562
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:59,023
You've nothing left to fight with.

563
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,742
I've just heard about your son.

564
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,995
My condolences.

565
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,627
These windows.
When were these put in?

566
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,922
You can think of windows
at a time like this?

567
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,550
When were the windows put in?

568
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,595
Well, they were made
and remade several times.

569
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,931
The church was badly damaged
in the 1860s.

570
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,975
A lot of the glass was lost or replaced.

571
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,436
It's a bit of a jigsaw puzzle.

572
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,314
It wasn't a very good job.

573
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,733
Some of the fragments were...

574
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:48,656
This is not just academic interest, is it?

575
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,533
You're damn right it isn't.

576
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,495
That thing killed my son.
I stood there and watched him do it.

577
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:02,628
It's not human, that thing.

578
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:07,967
If I was your friend Declan,
I'd say that was the devil.

579
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,262
- But you don't believe in the devil.
- No, I don't believe in the devil.

580
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:15,057
But something started the rumor.

581
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:33,909
I knew it. That's it. It just didn't fit.

582
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,619
What?

583
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,294
That's the missing piece.

584
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,296
Look. This image doesn't fit there.

585
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,298
But look at this.

586
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,258
There's one hand,

587
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,469
and there's the other one.

588
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:52,678
So?

589
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,765
I think this guy in the picture,

590
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,101
I think he beat the creature once before.

591
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,561
This is paganism.

592
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:04,106
Just look at it. It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

593
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:08,152
That is what I saw.
That is what killed my son.

594
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,030
And that is out there right now,
ready and waiting.

595
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,323
Please, you're distraught.

596
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,200
Goddamn it, don't you humor me!

597
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,328
Mr. Hallenbeck, this is Christ's house.

598
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,999
It wasn't always His, was it?

599
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,651
We couldn't see much, of course,

600
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,278
even with the torches,

601
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,656
but I had a pretty good idea
what was going on.

602
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,576
- Why was that?
- Smelled the blood.

603
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:39,702
Really?

604
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,579
Certainly.

605
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:46,000
It had a coppery smell about it.
You couldn't miss it.

606
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:50,296
- Jesus, what was that?
- Go on.

607
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,257
Then, of course, we found the body.

608
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,929
What's going on?

609
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,369
All right, keep calm. Keep calm.

610
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:25,039
- Felt like an earthquake.
- Where's the door?

611
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,291
Kick it out.

612
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,752
Get out here.

613
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,131
What is it, Tom?

614
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,735
Somebody get the police!
Get the police!

615
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,575
Here, you bastard!

616
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,006
Oh, God, no! Mary!

617
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,363
Shoot it. Shoot it.

618
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,630
- Well?
- Yes, we've got it, sir.

619
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:58,340
- Where?
- The caravan park.

620
01:01:58,424 --> 01:01:59,925
- Get the cars around the front.
- On my way.

621
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,552
We'll be right there.

622
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,139
It's territorial. I told you so.

623
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,515
- Where do you think you're going?
- With you.

624
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:08,225
- No, you're not.
- You can't stop me.

625
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,519
- Conroy, hold this man.
- Mr. Hallenbeck...

626
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,813
- Get your hands off me.
- Howard, please.

627
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,606
Just stay here with us.

628
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,308
God almighty.

629
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:55,105
It went over there, towards the village.

630
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,489
- Get ambulances.
- Right.

631
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:05,783
Move.

632
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,675
You wanna go back to the hotel?

633
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,386
Elaine?

634
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:29,765
You wanna go back to the hotel?

635
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:30,641
No.

636
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:34,728
- You'd be more comfortable there.
- Only if you come.

637
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:38,357
- No, I'm gonna talk to Gissing.
- Let him do his job.

638
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,692
I want him to make
house-to-house inquiries.

639
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,486
They know something, these people.

640
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,114
What are you talking about?

641
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,494
He's been here before,
this... this thing.

642
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:51,870
In Rathmorne.

643
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:54,456
And these people, they beat him.
Look at this.

644
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,334
This is a stained glass window
in their church.

645
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:03,841
Do you see? He's being done in
by whatever the hooded figure's holding.

646
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,886
It looks like a tablet,
but it's a missing piece of glass.

647
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,013
That's the missing piece.

648
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,016
I think there's other missing pieces too.

649
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:17,104
It's like the handle
of a knife or a sword or...

650
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:19,523
something.

651
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:21,900
But it's a weapon.

652
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:24,862
- Weapon?
- Yeah.

653
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,698
If I can find it...

654
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,617
I can do that goddamn thing in.

655
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,703
Stop the car.

656
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,959
- Where is he?
- We probably passed him.

657
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,711
He'd never have gone this far on foot.

658
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,254
- Damn him!
- What shall I do?

659
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:45,841
- Turn around. Let's go back.
- Yes, sir.

660
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,101
Holy Jesus! Christ!

661
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:59,104
No! No! No!

662
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,636
Yes.

663
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,389
For you.

664
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,145
Mr. Hallenbeck?

665
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,314
- Gissing here yet?
- He's very busy at the moment.

666
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,149
It's very important that I talk to him.

667
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:47,861
Mr. Hallenbeck, you've already
made your feelings perfectly clear.

668
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,697
The inspector will see you
as soon as he can.

669
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,661
In the meantime,
can I get you a cup of tea?

670
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:56,870
Go fuck yourself.

671
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,668
- I'll pass that suggestion along.
- You do that.

672
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,838
You came!

673
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,327
<i>Quickly!</i>

674
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,373
I can't hear a word you're saying.
Who is this?

675
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,291
Get over here quickly!

676
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,753
Who is this? Reverend, is that you?
Well, where are you?

677
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:53,755
The church, damn you!

678
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:19,322
Control to Inspector Gissing.

679
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:22,951
Control to Inspector Gissing.

680
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:25,203
Is Inspector Gissing there?

681
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,676
There's no escape!

682
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,678
Keep your voice down.
He's in the rectory.

683
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,305
You think I don't know?

684
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,349
I see what he sees.

685
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,059
He wants you, you know.

686
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,228
Wants to baptize you.

687
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:51,897
- You're out of your mind.
- No!

688
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:55,108
I simply saw the light.

689
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:58,570
Declan, you are one of God's teachers.

690
01:09:58,653 --> 01:09:59,654
God?

691
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:01,907
He is God!

692
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:15,670
The parish records.

693
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:20,008
He was here before Christ,
before civilization.

694
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,927
He was king here.

695
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,891
No. Gissing went after it.
We're trying to organize...

696
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,185
<i>I just got a call from the reverend.
It's down at the church.</i>

697
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,269
The church.

698
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,023
It's down at the church.
Yeah, we're on our way.

699
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,319
Rawhead.

700
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,488
That's what they called him.

701
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,073
Rawhead!

702
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,616
You stay here.

703
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,543
No. No, no, no, Declan.
Wait. Wait. Declan, wait.

704
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:57,462
Think. Think.

705
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,339
It doesn't care about you.

706
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,549
When it's finished with you,
what will it do with you?

707
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:05,095
Kill me, I hope!

708
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,347
Declan, for the love of God.

709
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,016
Get upstairs, fuck-face.

710
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,560
I can't keep God waiting.

711
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,869
You did this?

712
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,414
I'm going to destroy it all.

713
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:37,252
He wants me to take it apart
piece by piece.

714
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,461
You wouldn't dare.

715
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:40,588
He's not scared!

716
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:44,718
Why doesn't he come in
and do it personally?

717
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:53,560
I think your God <i>is</i> afraid, Declan.

718
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,520
- No.
- Yes.

719
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,981
Afraid to set foot in Christ's house.

720
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,357
No!

721
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,821
Your pathetic little shepherd
has no hold on him.

722
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,114
Or me!

723
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,993
I know my real master when I see him.

724
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:13,496
And so will you!

725
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:36,895
Get back.

726
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:45,278
Will we rush the church, sir?

727
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:47,405
No. Just stand by.

728
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:59,834
This is holy ground.

729
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:02,629
God's ground.

730
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:17,852
Oh, Jesus.

731
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,187
What was that?

732
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,777
Keep them back, out of the line of fire!

733
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,529
Come on. Back.

734
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,116
Come on. Out the way now. Stay back!

735
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,120
- Stay back here!
- Target!

736
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:38,540
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

737
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,250
He's got the vicar.

738
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,677
Kill the murdering bastard!

739
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,682
Oh, no! The poor soul!

740
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,392
Can we shoot the bastard, sir?

741
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,893
We may hit the old man.

742
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,526
He's dead already. Look at him.

743
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:08,194
No, he's still moving.

744
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,805
Jesus, have mercy on his soul!

745
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:37,932
No!

746
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:39,058
Ready!

747
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:43,396
Fire!

748
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:53,781
For you! For you!

749
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,928
For you! For you!

750
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,407
I can't just stay here.
I have to do something.

751
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:37,867
Howard, no!

752
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:54,300
Oh, Jesus.

753
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,512
Oh, my God.

754
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:00,557
Hallenbeck, over here!

755
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,526
Get some help.
He's bleeding to death.

756
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:13,319
Jesus. Dear God.

757
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,322
Stay in the church.

758
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,283
- What's he saying?
- Shut up.

759
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,160
The altar.

760
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,913
It... afraid.

761
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:25,915
Something...

762
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,085
in the altar.

763
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:44,767
You go back to the station.
My wife and my daughter are there.

764
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:46,185
I'll look after them.

765
01:16:47,312 --> 01:16:50,106
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus Christ.

766
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:10,501
What the fuck do you want?
Get the fuck out of here.

767
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:12,920
Get the fuck out of here!

768
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,666
It's afraid of something.
What? What is it afraid of?

769
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:00,213
He got into the altar.

770
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:01,547
I couldn't stop him.

771
01:20:01,631 --> 01:20:03,174
But you can kill him.

772
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:09,806
There he is.

773
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:11,599
There!

774
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:21,984
Okay, sweetheart, let's do it.

775
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,368
Okay, do it.

776
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,454
Come on.

777
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:37,416
Do it.

778
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:09,824
Kill the fucker! Now!

779
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:13,286
Take me. Yes.

780
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,257
Oh, my God.

781
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:42,690
Elaine, get out of here. Get out!

782
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,861
Howard!

783
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:15,074
A woman.

784
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:18,911
It had to be a woman.

785
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:19,115
No!

786
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:33,754
It's okay.

787
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,342
It's okay. It's okay.

788
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,469
It's okay. It's okay.

789
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:47,268
We can go home now.

790
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:50,312
It's all over now.

791
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:51,856
It's all over.
