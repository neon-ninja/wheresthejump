1
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,695
So on the heels of the Cold War,

2
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,989
Barry Goldwater, a businessman

3
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,117
and a five-term United States Senator
from Arizona,

4
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,662
decided to run for the election
of the presidency.

5
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,233
He had a substantial impact and...

6
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,616
Are you excited for summer?

7
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,006
Yeah.

8
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,716
Are you gonna see your friends?

9
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,218
- No.
- Why not?

10
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,846
- Don't have any.
- So, you'll be with your brother?

11
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,556
Yeah.

12
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:49,478
Then, Milo, I think we've seen each other
enough that we trust each other, right?

13
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,687
Yeah.

14
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,440
You know you can answer honestly with me.

15
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,485
- Yeah.
- There are no consequences.

16
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,852
You understand you don't get in trouble?

17
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,240
Yeah.

18
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,357
Have you been hurting any animals?

19
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,078
No.

20
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,195
Not at all? Not even thinking?

21
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,835
Maybe thinking, but... no.

22
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,837
So you're thinking about that?

23
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,673
Tell me about that.
Tell me about the thoughts.

24
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,801
It's nothing. Just thoughts now and then.

25
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,295
But I don't do it, not any more.

26
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,204
- Where you goin'?
- Get him!

27
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,013
- Come here.
- Fuck him up, D.

28
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,804
- Hold him.
- Hit him!

29
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,816
Stop it, retard.

30
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,488
That's nasty. You've got some on me, bro.

31
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:27,441
- That was fun.
- That's right. You'd better run, little bitch.

32
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,533
...afterwards, insurance
companies may spend millions

33
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,162
figuring out ways to pay you
less than you deserve.

34
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,280
Their profits depend on you...

35
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,503
Hey.

36
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,245
Did you buy milk?

37
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,551
No.

38
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,053
We need milk.

39
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,639
Did you pay the internet bill?

40
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,756
- No.
- I need the internet.

41
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,812
Then pay it. Get milk too.

42
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,608

00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,080
Oh. Nothin'.

50
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,053
- Will they eat all that?
- Yeah.

51
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,430
Well, they've scooped all the grass
out of the stomach

52
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,005
- and they eat the whole stomach lining...
- It's licking it at the moment.

53
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,689
Milo!

54
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,607
What?

55
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,100
I'm gonna disappear for a few hours.

56
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,486
Okay.

57
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,813
Hey, freak. Don't ignore me, motherfucker.

58
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,914
Yeah, it's time to go home, freak.

59
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,042
Yo, lock up your dogs. Woof, woof!

60
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,716
Ah, little weird-ass motherfucker!

61
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,676
All right, let's be out of here.

62
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,826
The elevator's broke.

63
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,522
Oh.

64
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,575
This way.

65
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,009
Hello?

66
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,516
Could, um... could you help me with my bags?

67
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,926
Thanks so much.

68
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,089
- What floor?
- Nine.

69
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,429
- What's your name?
- Milo.

70
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:16,341
Holy shit. Thanks again.

71
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,027
Goodnight.

72
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,679
Let's go. Up you get.

73
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,546
Get off your ass. Get in there.

74
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,722
I think she loves me. Mm!

75
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,700
I thought I had a small one.

76
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,584
- Does that hurt?
- What the fuck?

77
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,797
Sorry. I saw you here earlier.

78
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,269
Yeah.

79
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,966
They're dicks.

80
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,940
You want a drink?

81
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,814
Sure.

82
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,038
I guess I asked a stupid question.

83
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,458
- What?
- Does it hurt?

84
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,495
Sex?

85
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,380
Not really.

86
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,247
No.

87
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,095
Oh, and...

88
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,212
You know what I mean, it's like...

89
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,796
It's like a release.

90
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,221
And, well, it's not like
I'm making my arm any uglier.

91
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,021
- What's that?
- Psoriasis.

92
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,980
It's not catchy or anything, don't worry.

93
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,494
- Can you catch it from blood?
- What?

94
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,080
Like, can I get it from your blood?

95
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,197
No, no, no. It's not like that.

96
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,538
Can I see?

97
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,500
Can I see?

98
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,143
Oh, my God, gross.

99
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,636
- Sorry.
- Hey, um... I mean...

100
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,769
I mean kind of sweet... gross.

101
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,399
Wow, you're really into, erm...

102
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,359
Vampires.

103
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,153
I was gonna say scary movies.

104
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,225
No. Vampires.

105
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,453
Like Twilight?

106
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,289
Yeah. No.

107
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,833
I don't know. I haven't watched them.

108
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,950
Oh, you should. They're really good.

109
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,382
Do you want to watch a video?

110
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,326
The average American consumes
120 pounds of beef per year.

111
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,079
In a typical month, slaughterhouses
across the country

112
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,325
will kill nearly three million cows
and 385,000 lambs.

113
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,385
Each individual on the assembly line
has his own specialty.

114
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,262
During this whole process, I began...

115
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,223
Erm... I have to go. I...

116
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,421
- I'm late for this thing, so...
- Yeah.

117
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,984
Sorry.

118
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,228
It's fine. I just... I just have to go.

119
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,278
What the fuck are you doing?

120
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,829
Nothing.

121
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,001
- No! No!
- Let her go!

122
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:09,865
Do it!

123
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,874
Now look at her! Look at her!

124
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,413
Hello?

125
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,631
Hello?

126
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,459
Milo!

127
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,136
Hey, Milo, wait up.

128
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,138
- Hi.
- Hi.

129
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,558
- Uh... Where are you going?
- Home.

130
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,476
- Walking?
- Yeah.

131
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,593
- Cool. Can I walk with you?
- Sure.

132
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,402
Do people ever tell you you don't talk a lot?

133
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,488
- No.
- Really?

134
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,525
No one ever speaks to me.

135
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,506
Sorry for showing you that video.

136
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,969
Don't worry about it. Um...
My friend Leo loves sick videos like that.

137
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,847
He used to show me
that kind of stuff all the time.

138
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,308
I mean, it's no big deal. I just had to go.

139
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,254
No, it's... it's fine.

140
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,695
Do you ever think about suicide?

141
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,267
Not really. I can't kill myself.

142
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,772
- You can't kill yourself?
- Yeah. I can't.

143
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,866
Like, it's your religion?

144
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,245
I mean, yeah, sure. It's just the rules.

145
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,504
It's just the way it is.

146
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,465
My mom killed herself.

147
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,926
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

148
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,749
That's fine.
It's just something that happened.

149
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,636
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

150
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,700
Do you want to go to the movies
with me tomorrow?

151
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,214
Yeah, okay.

152
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,001
Okay, cool.

153
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,720
What time?

154
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,713
Noon. I'll stop by your place.

155
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,835
- Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,758
Do you wanna...

157
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,127
Did you like it?

158
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,881
Uh... I thought it was interesting.
I liked the music.

159
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,092
But I still think Twilight is better.

160
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,887
You should see it or read it.
At least the first one.

161
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,014
I prefer Let the Right One In.

162
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,559
- What's that?
- Maybe I'll show it to you some night.

163
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,426
Okay.

164
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,566
You know, you're the only one
who hasn't, like,

165
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,735
immediately asked me what I'm doing here.

166
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,695
Do you live with your parents?

167
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,950
No, my grandfather. He's pretty awful.

168
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,079
I mean, I guess the best thing about him
is that... that he's slow,

169
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,749
- so he can't catch me that often.
- Catch you?

170
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,585
Yeah. He's a violent motherfucker.

171
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,547
Put a cigarette out on me last week.

172
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,007
I almost went to the cops.

173
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,719
Wow. I guess you don't
like your grandpa much?

174
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,513
Yeah, it's fucked up...

175
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,506
- Where's your dad?
- Dead. They're both dead.

176
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,229
- Oh. Mine, too.
- Really?

177
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,191
Yeah. My dad died when I was like, eight,

178
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,604
but he got sick when I was like, six.

179
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,198
I mean, it was...
It took a long time for him to die,

180
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,521
but when he did die, it was like,
a release, you know?

181
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,649
He was yelling and screaming all the time.

182
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,742
- Jesus.
- Yeah. It is what it is.

183
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:47,164
It's just, I bet the vampires in Twilight
aren't very realistic.

184
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,333
There's no such thing as a realistic vampire.

185
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,836
There is. I mean, more realistic.

186
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,784
I mean, vampires don't twinkle.

187
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,635
Okay. So... So, what are vampires like?

188
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:04,097
Well, I think it starts
with drinking blood, like...

189
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,141
Like, you have a need to.

190
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,895
It's like... It's like when you have a cut
on your finger when you're a little kid,

191
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,023
and you're sucking it,
but eventually that's not good enough,

192
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,068
so you... so you switch to animals
and stuff like that,

193
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,570
and then, you know, people, and...

194
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,199
And you change a lot
after the first person you kill,

195
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:27,195
and you change a lot more after...
after one after another.

196
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,959
But I think when you first start off
being a vampire, all the...

197
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,586
all the stuff you see in the movies
doesn't really matter.

198
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,339
Like, you can go out in the sun
and you can eat garlic,

199
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,467
and I don't even think
the church stuff is even true.

200
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,511
Like, maybe to religious vampires, you know?

201
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,972
And I don't think you get bit.

202
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,261
I think it's like a...
it's like a disease you get.

203
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,131
Wow. Which book is this?

204
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,399
It's not a book, it's just how I think it is.

205
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,985
Vampires existed before books did.

206
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,648
Well, the sun kills them in True Blood.

207
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,075
I did not watch that show. It did not look
like it was gonna be realistic at all.

208
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,952
Oh, my God, you should. It's so good.

209
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:12,124
In this one... erm, in this one episode,
the vampire that makes Eric

210
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,378
starts feeling, like, really bad
about what he does, so he kills himself.

211
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,048
He like, goes up on a roof,
I think, and then...

212
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,962
and then the sun comes up and just kills him.

213
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,432
I mean, it could be true, but I don't think
a vampire can kill himself.

214
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,144
- Why not?
- I don't know. It's like a...

215
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,557
it's like an animal instinct.

216
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,066
So, they get to live forever?

217
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,684
Maybe. I don't know yet.

218
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,333
Do you go to their graves?

219
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,543
No.

220
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,422
I don't go to my mom's grave.
I wouldn't even know where to go.

221
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,341
What do you mean?

222
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,011
My brother handled everything,
and he doesn't like to talk about it.

223
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,263
You didn't go to the funeral?

224
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,300
No. He said I shouldn't.

225
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,348
Well, then why not ask him?

226
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,191
I don't think that's a good idea. He...

227
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,309
He's weird about it.
He doesn't want to talk about her.

228
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,271
That's so fucked up.

229
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,995
Would you go if you knew where she was?

230
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,623
I guess.

231
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,037
I'm gonna find her. I mean, do you mind?

232
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,999
I guess not.

233
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:48,005
I'll go with you to yours and then
you can come with me to mine. Deal?

234
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,722
Okay.

235
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,543
Cool.

236
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,685
Yo, freak.

237
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,863
No, no. That's not good enough, freak.
Come over here.

238
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,526
- Just keep walking.
- It's best if we go.

239
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,120
What's up? Who's your girlfriend?

240
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,663
My name's Sophie.

241
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,957
Hey, why are you slumming
over in the ghetto, Sophie?

242
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,042
Haven't you seen her?
She's living around here.

243
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,877
Yo, that ass? No fucking way, my nigga.

244
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,074
You all right, white bitch?

245
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,341
I'm sorry. I don't mean no offence.
I'm just playing.

246
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,136
- So why are you living here, white bitch?
- I live with my grandfather.

247
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,847
Is he that mean old white motherfucker
up on the ninth floor?

248
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,766
Can we go?

249
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,930
Of course you can go.
I ain't your fucking daddy.

250
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,981
Tell your brother I said hi, freak.

251
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,358
- Come on, man.
- Jungle fever fucker.

252
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,304
Come on, man.

253
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,869
They seemed nice.

254
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,566
They're in the K.
Some of them have killed people.

255
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,614
That was sarcasm.

256
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,747
I had fun tonight. I'm sorry about the...

257
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,091
Goodnight.

258
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,993
Yeah.

259
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,520
Milo, wake up.

260
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,883
Wake up!

261
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,112
What?

262
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,935
There's some white girl
waitin' outside for you.

263
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,733
I found her.

264
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,519
So, what's your favourite vampire movie?

265
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,489
I guess the most realistic.
Like, I like Martin a lot.

266
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,992
It's a '70s one and it's... it's good.
It's... it's realistic.

267
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,538
And Near Dark is really good.
It's pretty cool and realistic.

268
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,332
And the one I was telling you about,
Let the Right One In.

269
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,418
I'm not sure how realistic it is.
I mean, like, she can climb on walls,

270
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,005
and I think maybe
they're just really good climbers.

271
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:33,705
And Shadow of the Vampire is...
It's good. It's pretty cool and realistic.

272
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,921
Do you miss her?

273
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,101
I guess I do.

274
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,423
It was about the making of Nosferatu.

275
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,185
I miss them.

276
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,414
I forgot to bring flowers.

277
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,458
What does it matter
whether you brought flowers or not?

278
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,450
She's not gonna know.

279
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,299
- You wanna talk?
- Not really.

280
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,038
Yo, it's that white girl again.
She's at the door.

281
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,082
Tell her I'm not home.

282
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,553
Really?

283
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,380
Yeah.

284
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,117
- I'll ask him.
- Yeah?

285
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,286
Yeah, I'll ask him now, now, now.

286
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,372
Hey. Hey, bro. Little brother.

287
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,916
Hey, kid.

288
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,626
Hey, what's up, man?

289
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:33,505
Yeah, uh, we were just wondering if
you knew where we could buy some C?

290
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,883
Yeah, please, or even some molly?

291
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,135
They don't sell it.

292
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,804
Uh... We're just wondering, uh,

293
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,515
you know, if you could help us out,
if you knew someone?

294
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,805
We're visiting from out of town
and we were hoping to party tonight.

295
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,065
- Uh...
- Yeah, I'll help you.

296
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,316
- Cool.
- Come on.

297
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,934
Yeah, awesome. All right. I'll be right back.

298
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,772
Hey, wait up.

299
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,526
Hey.

300
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,633
Oh, shit.

301
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,772
Come on.

302
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,043
Hello?

303
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,424
Hello?

304
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,305
Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
This is kinda fucked up.

305
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,596
Hey, who's this?

306
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,072
Hey, what's up?

307
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,984
You guys must be them, right?

308
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,787
I'm, uh... I'm looking for some C,
or some molly if you've got it.

309
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,121
Wait. Hold up, what?

310
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,291
Uh... C. Cocaine? Or molly.

311
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,669
Oh, so you think everybody
that live up in here is a drug dealer?

312
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,630
No, no, dude. Uh... This kid sent me here.
I didn't think anything.

313
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,507
Why the fuck are you asking for drugs, then?

314
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,677
- If you don't think that?
- Whoa, whoa, okay. Erm...

315
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,222
- Look, I'm sorry, uh... I don't...
- You don't think you're fucking racist?

316
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,099
Whoa, I'm not racist, okay?

317
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,476
Oh, that's exactly what we fucking need.

318
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,895
Fuck, are you a cop?

319
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,898
Okay, this is just a misunderstanding,
I think. Yeah.

320
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,985
He said, "This is a misunderstanding."

321
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,738
Okay, I'm just gonna go now.
You guys are on the door.

322
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,949
Now shut the fuck up.

323
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,327
Little G, Little G.
What shall we do with this dude, huh?

324
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,288
- Let's fuck him up.
- Hey, you hear that?

325
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,623
- Dudes, come on. Look.
- Get him! Go ahead, get him!

326
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,208
- Whoa!
- Shit!

327
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,253
Whoa. What the fuck is wrong with you,
hitting a little kid, huh?

328
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,339
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Get that fucker.

329
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,137
Hitting little kids!

330
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,180
What the fuck do you think this is, huh?

331
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,850
Come up here talking about drugs,
then you go and swing on Little G.

332
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,603
Hey, man, stop crying. Come over here.

333
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,925
You wanna hang with us?

334
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,692
- Shoot this bitch.
- What?

335
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,349
Chill.

336
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,391
- No!
- Shut up!

337
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,731
Are you gonna do it or not?

338
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,372
Wait. What are you doing?
Wait. Please, please.

339
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,665
Oh, shit, wait!

340
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,293
- What the fuck did you do?
- I didn't know he'd pull the trigger.

341
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,794
- Come on, man!
- I had the safety on!

342
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,082
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

343
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,584
- Shit.
- Come on. Let's be out. Come on.

344
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,798
Hey! Hey, you, tell me where Mike is!

345
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,592
Stop! Hey!

346
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,454
...told us to respond.
Do you want our unit to respond?

347
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,794
We pass my road here.

348
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,422
- Hold on just a minute.
- Ten-four.

349
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,149
Oh, yeah. Right here looks good, right?

350
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,680
The 7-2 is in backlog.
I got a 78 car over here.

351
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,922
Er, we're going into the 7-2.

352
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,942
- Defending a snitch?
- Thanks, Milo. Stay safe.

353
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,479
Seriously.

354
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:40,038
...you tell me, "Ah, I'm buying a new car."

355
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,529
Welcome home.

356
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:46,502
Where have you been last night?
This place has been crazy.

357
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,129
Yeah, I bet.

358
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,382
We were on TV.

359
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,675
We were?

360
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:55,247
Our building.

361
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,921
Someone killed a white boy in the basement.

362
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,893
No shit?

363
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:05,842
Yeah. It's been crazy.
It's been on all the news channels.

364
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,559
Cool.

365
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,423
Why are you avoiding me?

366
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,884
I'm not avoiding you.

367
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,081
- Liar.
- I'm not a liar.

368
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,132
Well, liar, I got you this.

369
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,010
- It's Twilight.
- I see that.

370
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,737
Promise me you'll read it.

371
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,809
I promise.

372
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,498
Milo! What are you doing in here?

373
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:41,914
Come on, get out.

374
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,565
Are you gonna tell me what the fuck is going
on? I heard you talked to the police.

375
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,317
I didn't talk to them. They took me in.

376
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,653
Why did they give you a ride home,
if you ain't talked to them?

377
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,989
They said that if I didn't help them,
that they'd make it seem like I snitched.

378
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,701
Hey, they'll kill you
if they even think you talked to them.

379
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,037
- I didn't tell them anything.
- All right.

380
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,234
You know it don't matter what I think.

381
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,368
You saw it?

382
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,327
- Yeah.
- Shit.

383
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,627
Did they see you see it?

384
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,755
No.

385
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,921
I don't know.

386
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,693
Milo, I can't protect you from them,
you know that, right?

387
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,560
Lewis, stop.

388
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,591
Okay. Okay.

389
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,082
Lewis!

390
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,918
And don't trust your cops neither, all right?

391
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,087
They'll frame you for that shit
just cos they can.

392
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,124
Okay, I get it.

393
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,123
Listen to your older brother.

394
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,876
All right. I understand.

395
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,175
All right.

396
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,227
So this is what you do? You sit up here?

397
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,949
Uh, I study.

398
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,066
That's cool.

399
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,082
Do you believe in God?

400
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,074
No. Do you?

401
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:41,041
I guess... Yeah.

402
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,453
I had a feeling that you didn't.

403
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,428
I mean like... I think we're all special.

404
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,890
I believe in that. I... I guess it's magical,

405
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,100
but I don't think
anyone intended anything in it.

406
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,354
I think when you die, you're just...
you're just gone.

407
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,939
Don't say that. It's so fucking creepy.

408
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,011
It's true. I think.

409
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,854
Okay. Okay, moving on. Erm...

410
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,660
What would you do with a million dollars?

411
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,080
What if I told you I had one million dollars?

412
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,957
- Then I'd steal it.
- You would?

413
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,793
No.

414
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,295
But I'd ask to borrow some.

415
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,867
What would you do with it?

416
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,334
Get out of here. You know, move out.

417
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,793
- Where would you go?
- Anywhere.

418
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,978
But I, erm... I have a cousin in Alabama.

419
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:42,052
She'd let me stay there. I could pitch in.
I'd probably go there.

420
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,726
Cool.

421
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,477
Okay, so what would you do
with a million dollars?

422
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,237
I've got plans.

423
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,038
That's it?

424
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,235
Yeah. I've got plans.

425
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,544
I need any help you can give me.

426
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:05,163
I need three dollars
to have a place to sleep.

427
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,086
Thanks.

428
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,010
You're welcome.

429
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,480
Asher!

430
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,596
Bye.

431
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,160
Yo, Milo.

432
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:07,211
Been talking to 5-0?

433
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,813
No.

434
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,090
That's not what we heard.

435
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,509
You heard wrong. I don't do that.

436
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,678
That kid screamed like a little bitch, right?

437
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,138
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, come on.

438
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,926
You don't think
he screamed like a little bitch?

439
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:27,176
It's a'ight, but Malik said
he saw you there. Right, Malik?

440
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,318
I don't know what you're talking about.

441
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,612
Don't act fucking smart, okay?

442
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,729
I'm not.

443
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,529
Can I go?

444
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,876
This ain't over.

445
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,268
Do you want to do it again?

446
00:53:13,014 --> 00:53:14,451
Stop!

447
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,191
...defrosting or preheating
that giant oven...

448
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,997
...better, healthier and easier...

449
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,999
Um, so, I'll see you tomorrow, then?

450
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,741
Yeah.

451
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,298
Bye.

452
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:37,259
Aah, I see you, bro.

453
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,637
Lewis.

454
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:43,434
What? That was nice.

455
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,138
...oven is a new way to cook.
It's energy efficient...

456
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,280
Lewis?

457
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,865
What?

458
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,909
What day is it?

459
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,036
Friday.

460
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,288
No, the date?

461
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,280
The 14th.

462
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:50,457
Getting money for injured people
is a rare skill.

463
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:54,086
Insurance companies often refuse
to pay what is fair.

464
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:59,299
The lawyer you pick must be able
to make them pay, one way or another.

465
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,510
- I'm Lowell "The Hammer" Stanley.
- Hey.

466
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,097
Hey. What's up?

467
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:08,517
Nothin'. Can I watch TV with you?

468
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,310
Oh, good, good, good.

469
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,772
Come on! Make it work!

470
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:21,739
The neighbours heard me screaming
and threatened to call the cops,

471
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,232
so he let me go.

472
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,287
Are you hurt?

473
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:32,040
No, I don't think I need
to see the doctor or anything.

474
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,239
I just really don't wanna go back there.

475
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,716
Is she okay?

476
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,628
Yeah.

477
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,552
Can I stay here?

478
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,099
Sure.

479
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,396
The Chapstick.

480
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,969
Where's the Chapstick?

481
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,027
Where's the Chapstick?

482
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,508
Where's the Chapstick?

483
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,015
Where's the Chapstick?

484
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,132
# The Chapstick, Chapstick

485
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:36,054
# The Chapstick, where's the Chapstick? #

486
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,935
Where's the Chapstick?

487
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:44,163
It's energy efficient. It saves time.

488
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,851
Don't you think you should get your stuff?

489
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,494
You mean, like, that I've been
in the same outfit for, like, a week?

490
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,538
And borrowing my clothes.

491
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:20,282
I mean, it's fine.
It's just, you have to eventually, right?

492
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,656
Yeah.

493
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,928
You... you can stay here
as long as you need to.

494
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:50,100
Okay. Thanks.

495
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,679
Are you sure you don't mind me not coming?

496
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:17,548
It's fine. I'm used to spending time
by myself anyways.

497
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,972
Okay. Thanks.

498
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,358
Um, and then...

499
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,475
Oh, we'll get your stuff.

500
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,478
I think I've convinced Lewis to come.

501
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,117
Okay, let's see.

502
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,280
He'll do it. See you soon.

503
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,141
...pain in the tuchas,
particularly when you think,

504
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,851
"Why can't I qualify for credit?"

505
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,895
Well, the first place you gotta come
is Major World, because at...

506
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,024
Hi.

507
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,651
- Hey.
- Um... Sorry.

508
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,320
I was, um... I was wondering if you had,

509
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,616
um, a stamp, um, and a... an envelope?

510
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,107
Um...

511
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,874
No.

512
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:27,163
- No?
- Um... I don't know.

513
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,840
Um... okay. Okay, then.

514
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,843
So you really like him?

515
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,678
Yeah, I do.

516
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,680
We can help you sort out what really happened

517
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,682
and get you the compensation you deserve.

518
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,100
Call 800-79...

519
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,602
What's the problem?

520
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,854
This is a legitimate cheque, okay?

521
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:49,678
There's nothing wrong with this cheque.
It's perfectly viable.

522
01:01:54,669 --> 01:02:00,006
Hi, uh, I'd like to cash this cheque
and pay these two bills with it.

523
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,698
And can I get a money order?

524
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,706
She didn't say anything. She just left.

525
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,341
Hi. Uh...

526
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,590
I know...

527
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,809
I know you saw that stuff,
but if we could meet, then...

528
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,479
if we could meet, then I could explain.

529
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:17,324
723497 is not available...

530
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,041
I don't want to hear it...

531
01:05:59,566 --> 01:06:02,837
- ...fucking money!
- Cheap motherfucker!

532
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,757
- Give me the fucking money!
- Why?

533
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,842
Why don't you fucking go...

534
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,640
- Goddamn you!
- Fucking...

535
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,850
Fuck you!

536
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:20,522
- Fucking...
- Fucking loud-mouthed bitch!

537
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:24,220
You wanna take this? Shut up!

538
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,528
...learning how to break free
of living pay cheque to pay cheque.

539
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,614
And the government can help you do that too!

540
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:48,534
There are programmes out there that will
pay you, like, $3,000 to pay your utility bills.

541
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,037
Or $4,000 to pay your grocery bills.

542
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:54,415
Or how about this? $10,000 to pay any bill!

543
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:58,127
But you have to know about the programmes.

544
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,797
That's the key. The government
doesn't even know what it has.

545
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,382
And you have to have
the right questions, too.

546
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,452
You can call...

547
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,226
I warned you!

548
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,645
Um, I remember the first time

549
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:02,775
I was emancipated from the foster system,
and I didn't have nowhere to go.

550
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,821
The reason, um, I became homeless

551
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:10,783
is because, um,
I just couldn't afford the rent.

552
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:15,358
The second time I became
homeless was domestic violence.

553
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,335
- You look like shit.
- I stayed everywhere.

554
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:26,549
On the side of the 1/6 freeway,
under the 405 freeway...

555
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,969
Um, I've slept behind dumpsters,

556
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,221
I've slept in squats,

557
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:37,171
which are, like, abandoned buildings
with no water, no lights, no nothing.

558
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,390
When you were there, did you, uh...

559
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,767
did you kill anyone?

560
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,395
No. No.

561
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,452
I saw a lot of parts.

562
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,746
You know, like body parts after bombings.

563
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,943
But no, I never killed no one. Why?

564
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,414
I was just wondering.

565
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,380
You do what you have to do.

566
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,172
No matter what.

567
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,224
Whatever it is you're doing,

568
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,394
there's someone doing
a whole lot worse, you know?

569
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,814
I guess.

570
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,913
No, ain't no guess.

571
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,707
You gotta remember that.

572
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,793
No matter how bad you think you done,

573
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,963
there's someone somewhere doing
a whole lot worse, is doing it now.

574
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,090
You think?

575
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,207
I mean, trust me, I know.

576
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:54,457
I fucking know.

577
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,391
Ain't nothing you're doing is as bad

578
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,893
as what people are doing all the time
to each other.

579
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:04,216
You know, what people just
close their eyes to and let happen.

580
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:09,610
You know, I bet whatever it is
you're worried about

581
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,478
ain't nothing compared
to the shit that goes on.

582
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,486
Yeah.

583
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,305
Goodnight, Lewis.

584
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:42,963
Goodnight, Milo.

585
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,135
What?

586
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,275
Milo and Lewis.

587
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,318
You know, it's like she gave us names

588
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:53,435
she knew would get our asses kicked.

589
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,525
Yeah.

590
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,692
I miss her.

591
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,991
I miss her too.

592
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:25,714
Hi.

593
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:30,351
Um... I'm sorry for leaving like that and...

594
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,069
and for not speaking to you.

595
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,862
I don't...

596
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:41,026
I wasn't snooping. I was just...
I was just looking for a pen and paper.

597
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:47,449
I didn't even really know what it meant,
but it...

598
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,669
but it kind of freaked me out.

599
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:54,298
I mean, I shouldn't have just left like that.
I'm sorry.

600
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,335
It's fine.

601
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:03,224
So... so, what was all that?

602
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,558
Are you...

603
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:10,225
are you working on a book about vampires
and a crazy killer or something?

604
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:14,513
It's nothing that matters any more.

605
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,185
Really? Cos it seemed really detailed.

606
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,943
Did you come up here to write more?

607
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,076
I'm not writing any more. I'm making a plan.

608
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:03,617
Shit, are you just giving all this to me?

609
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,579
- Yeah.
- Why the fuck would you do that?

610
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,915
So... so we can trust each other again.

611
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,293
I never spoke to the cops.

612
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:14,128
This stuff hot?

613
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,714
Yeah, very.

614
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,799
You got all this yourself?

615
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,843
- Yeah.
- How?

616
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,960
Uh... I break into places.

617
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,336
It's a lot of valuable shit.

618
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,061
So, we're cool?

619
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,856
Yeah, motherfucker, whatever.

620
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,768
Okay.

621
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,858
Wow.

622
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:19,895
Lewis said girls like flowers.

623
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:22,644
We mostly do.

624
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,502
Thanks.

625
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,464
This was nice.

626
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:39,683
Yeah.

627
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:11,173
- Hey.
- What?

628
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:14,840
What's with your fucking crazy eyes?

629
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,013
Huh?

630
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:20,429
Drink?

631
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:40,532
Wait.

632
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,834
- I wanted to give you something.
- Really?

633
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,629
Yeah.

634
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,805
It's for you to go to your cousin's.

635
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,647
Where did you get it?

636
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,983
Don't tell anyone you have it.
Just... just go.

637
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:24,461
Do you want to come with me?
I mean, you have to come with me.

638
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,046
- I can't.
- Why not?

639
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,882
You wouldn't like me in the end.

640
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,670
I'm not good. I never will be.

641
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,709
But I already know that you're crazy.

642
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:41,019
I'm not going. Just... just make sure you go.

643
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:42,691
Milo.

644
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,475
Go on, motherfucker!

645
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,935
Drop it! Drop that fucking gun!

646
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:30,903
Women's history, in this regard,

647
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:36,116
tries to merge two approaches
that have been used in the past.

648
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:40,281
There's contribution history,
which views women as...

649
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:49,206
- Can I go?
- You know we can't end early.

650
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,466
Can I draw?

651
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,503
What would you draw?

652
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,674
I've been drawing the sun a lot lately.

653
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,644
Hey, nice job cleaning the car.

654
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,396
- Thank you.
- So you heard, huh?

655
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:07,898
No.

656
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:10,359
They arrested all of them.

657
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:14,023
Andre, Troy, Mar. All of them.

658
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,907
You mean all your old friends?

659
01:25:17,437 --> 01:25:18,994
Yeah.

660
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,950
Don't remind me. You didn't know?

661
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:27,501
No. Why would I?

662
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,795
It's on the news, even.

663
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,005
They say they killed that white boy
in the basement

664
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,793
- and some white family in the Village.
- Really?

665
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,636
You didn't know?

666
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:40,675
- No.
- Yeah.

667
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,525
I just wanted to see if you'd left.

668
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,490
Call me.

669
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,284
Hey, freak.

670
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:50,352
Now you're not calling me?

671
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,604
Call me back.

672
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,721
Maybe come and meet me?

673
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:50,448
I read Twilight. I thought it sucked.

674
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,659
Not very realistic at all.

675
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:18,588
I've been thinking a lot,
and maybe a vampire can kill himself.

676
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:25,470
I mean, maybe not kill himself,
but arrange it.

677
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:34,691
Like, if he could do something
and know that it would get him killed.

678
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,033
That would get around the rule, I think.

679
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:59,059
I'm not... I'm not sure if vampires should...
are meant to be here.

680
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:01,686
I mean, I know they've always been here.

681
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:06,983
But I mean, if you can only exist
to hurt people, and you know better,

682
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:11,307
then maybe it's better to decide
not to exist at all.
