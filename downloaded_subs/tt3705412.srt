00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:29,618
<i>You know that evil Heavy Metal
that your parents hate you listening to?</i>

2
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,149
<i>You know those lyrics
about hell and doom,</i>

3
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:37,602
<i>demons ripping you new orifices
to shit out of?</i>

4
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,591
<i>But what if I told you it's all real?</i>

5
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:44,553
<i>I know...</i>

6
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,274
<i>I was there.</i>

7
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,392
<i>But wait... let's start
at the beginning.</i>

8
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:30,648
<i>It all started in Greypoint,</i>

9
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:33,686
<i>the middle of ass-fuck nowhere.</i>

10
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,253
<i>I had to shift here after my mum
went on a massive meth bender,</i>

11
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:42,401
<i>and tried to suck off a Santa Claus
in a crowded mall.</i>

12
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:45,944
<i>Mum got sent to a mental ward.</i>

13
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:48,905
<i>And I got stuck with my Uncle.</i>

14
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:04,503
<i>My Uncle Albert
was balls deep into Jesus.</i>

15
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,977
<i>He thought Ricky Martin was heavy.</i>

16
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:12,212
<i>He heard me cranking
some Disemboweled Corpse,</i>

17
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:14,133
<i>and he hasn't slept for days.</i>

18
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:21,719
<i>I brought about the end of the world.
Biggest dick move ever.</i>

19
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,654
Stop struggling.

20
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:26,122
It won't fit.

21
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:27,894
- Get up there.
- <i>This is Dion.</i>

22
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:30,492
<i>And that is probably the least
embarrassing orifice</i>

23
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,361
<i>that dice has been shoved into.</i>

24
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,196
Wait... Yes, it's in!

25
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,887
- <i>And this is my dickhead cousin.</i>
- Hey, David.

26
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:41,101
<i>He's hospitalized
more nerds than asthma.</i>

27
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,153
I saw Uncle Albert washing
your sheets this morning.

28
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:46,205
- You shit the bed or something?
- Fuckin' devil-worshiper.

29
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,306
I can't wait until my dad
kicks you out on the streets

30
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:51,842
and you've got to blow truck drivers
for food like your psycho mum.

31
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:54,490
His mum is a psycho.

32
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,829
You all right, man?

33
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,353
- Here's your dice.
- It's actually a die. Dice is plural.

34
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,281
And it's a D10. But...

35
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:12,503
Thanks.

36
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:19,027
- Jesus. Who's that?
- Oh, Medina Darcy.

37
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:22,247
<i>Number one cause
of awkward boners in Greypoint.</i>

38
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,868
- No dude.
- What do you mean "no"?

39
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:31,237
No way. Chicks like that,
they don't go out with metalheads.

40
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,290
They bang apes like your cousin.

41
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:36,157
Forget her, man.

42
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,192
At lunchtime,

43
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:43,248
do you want to do something
completely badass?

44
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:54,522
And that's... eight points
of non-lethal damage.

45
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:57,228
Exceeds your HP;
your cleric is unconscious.

46
00:03:57,328 --> 00:04:01,512
No fucking way. How is it
still breathing? I cast a fireball.

47
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:04,214
You cast it at a Fire troll.

48
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:07,817
- It's immune to fire.
- This is bullshit.

49
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:12,454
<i>Well, that's Giles. He was once suspended
for violating the CPR training dummy.</i>

50
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:17,071
I'm the DM, Giles.
What I say goes, okay? I am the law.

51
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,292
- This is your problem, Dion.
- Okay.

52
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,261
- This is why no woman will talk to you.
- Hey, do you know what?

53
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,831
A whole family of goblins has just
amassed around your dead body.

54
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,199
And one of them is humping your foot.
How do you like that?

55
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:29,746
How...

56
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:53,413
- Fuckin' nerds.
- Oh, Jesus.

57
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,714
It's piss.

58
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:02,224
They sprayed us with piss. Again!

59
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:05,961
Oh, the Player's Guide
is totally ruined.

60
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:09,931
<i>My friends are losers. My uncle keeps
trying to christen me in my sleep,</i>

61
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,366
<i>and I'm drenched
in my cousin's bodily fluids.</i>

62
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,748
X minus one...

63
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,884
X plus one...

64
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:28,011
Good work, Brodie. Nice technique.

65
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,960
Great shading on the demon penises.

66
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:36,317
Is that me having hot pokers
stuffed up my rectum by skeletons?

67
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:39,119
- Yes, sir.
- Nice likeness.

68
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,384
Very detailed. Two weeks detention.

69
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,560
Silence!

70
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,729
<i>So, that's me. Brodie.</i>

71
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,577
<i>Fuck my life.</i>

72
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,049
Fucking late again.

73
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:10,276
Oh, Christ,
it's my Satanist cousin, Brodie.

74
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:13,979
Look at that ugly loner.
I'm gonna make his life hell on earth.

75
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:17,269
That's really cool, David.
Can you please take me home now?

76
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,317
I thought we'd take
a drive or something.

77
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:25,639
Okay, it's hard to believe, but talking
about bullying isn't really a turn on.

78
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,893
<i>There was only one
cool thing about Greypoint...</i>

79
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:32,661
<i>Alien Records.</i>

80
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:36,030
<i>Byron sold the sickest vinyl,
while his psychic girlfriend, Abigail,</i>

81
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,770
<i>told fortunes to bored housewives.</i>

82
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:44,701
Welcome to Alien records.
How are things, kid?

83
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,600
Things are shitty.

84
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:52,974
- Check it out.
- Oh, Haxan Sword? Epic.

85
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:56,043
Yeah, man,
it's only one of 666 ever printed,

86
00:06:56,143 --> 00:07:00,980
numbered in blood
by Rikki Daggers himself.

87
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,663
Metal vinyl's over there by that kid.

88
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:44,085
Fuck, yes.

89
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:46,787
- Now that's a record, man.
- Yeah.

90
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:49,389
I've actually been after
that one for a while.

91
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,071
I'm Brodie, by the way.

92
00:07:56,395 --> 00:08:00,265
- Zakk.
- <i>After I met Zakk, my life changed.</i>

93
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,534
My mother was gonna
call me Storm though.

94
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:06,504
- Rad.
- I know.

95
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:10,639
<i>He was a tornado of chaos,
leaving a trail of destruction</i>

96
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:13,600
<i>and teen pregnancies in his wake.</i>

97
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:17,361
<i>Zakk got expelled after
stabbing a kid with a math compass</i>

98
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:19,496
<i>because he stepped
on his King Diamond tape.</i>

99
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:22,225
<i>Or was it a setsquare?</i>

100
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,784
<i>He used to help his dad
at the car workshop.</i>

101
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:30,540
<i>But mainly he just stole anything
not bolted on and then unbolted the rest.</i>

102
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,036
Yeah. Fuck you too, Bono.

103
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:37,660
Hey, man...

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,995
you want to do something crazy?

105
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:42,464
It's not role-playing is it?

106
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,106
What the fuck is role-playing?

107
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:03,020
<i>Zakk played bass so we started a band.</i>

108
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,816
Hey. This is... Giles and Dion.

109
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:16,390
Right, first things first.
What are we called?

111
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:20,056
- Murder Boner?
- Toothed Vagina.

112
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:22,261
Oh, Maggot Sperm.

113
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,762
Cannibal Unicorn.

114
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:27,698
How about like, thirteen S's.
You know, like...

115
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,636
Got it. Got it. DEATHGASM.

116
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:36,238
All spelled in capitals.
Lower case is for pussies.

117
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,073
Cool. What about...

118
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:40,542
I fuckin' said...

119
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:42,558
DEATHGASM!

120
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:58,087
Solo. Fuckin' shred it.

121
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:16,973
- Dude, I thought you said you could play.
- Sorry. I can. I can.

122
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:19,575
I'm just... I'm... I'm just rusty.

123
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:22,790
All right. From the top.

124
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,565
What? Just mixing it up.

125
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:45,039
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

126
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:53,113
- What the hell is that for?
- Dude, chill out. It's fine.

127
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:03,046
All right. You stay here.

128
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,449
You're lookout.

129
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,263
What?

130
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:25,195
Shit.

131
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:07,290
Zakk?

132
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:29,892
Zakk?

133
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,800
Oh, shit!

134
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:36,870
Did you shit yourself?

135
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:39,463
Nice surprise.

136
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:44,021
You're an accomplice, mate.
Don't puss out on me now. Come on.

137
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:46,132
Check it out.

138
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,779
Shit.

139
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,304
Man, these guys were legends
back in the day.

140
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,361
Check it out.

141
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,314
Rikki Daggers.

142
00:12:57,414 --> 00:13:01,577
He was a maniac. Didn't he used to kill
live rabbits on stage with a crowbar?

143
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:04,792
No, man. It was a claw hammer.

144
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:09,249
Wonder what happened to him?

145
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:13,052
Spent all his money on coke,
hookers and Satanist shit.

146
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:17,772
Last I heard he was hiding out in some
small, crappy New Zealand town.

147
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,729
- No fuckin' way.
- Yes fuckin' way.

148
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,717
- No fuckin' way.
- Rikki Fuckin' Daggers, man.

149
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:34,617
Hey, this way.

150
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,314
Holy fuck. Look at those amps.

151
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:48,830
No, they're old as hell;
probably all busted.

152
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:54,287
Is that...?

153
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:57,289
It's him. Is he dead?

154
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,957
- I bag that record.
- Dude, that's low.

155
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:02,305
I can go much lower.

156
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,514
Come on.

157
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:46,430
- Check it out.
- No fuckin' way.

158
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,563
Motherfucker!

159
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:52,535
- Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude...
- The record... drop it.

160
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,504
Kick it to me.

161
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:59,967
- Right. What the fuck...
- Chill.

162
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,984
...are you two cunts doing in my house?

163
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:07,024
- Let's get out of here. Come on.
- Don't you fuckin' move.

164
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:09,779
Aeon sent you, didn't he?

165
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:15,137
When are you occultist cunts
ever gonna fuckin learn?

166
00:15:15,237 --> 00:15:17,372
No, we're just... we're just metalheads.

167
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,474
We're fans.

168
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:23,427
Well, how did you find me?

169
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:26,596
Latest Death Scream, dude.
You were outed.

170
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:28,743
Oh, fuck.

171
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:31,746
Fuck!

172
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,117
We're all gonna die.

173
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,434
Shit. Someone's coming.

174
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:03,428
Here. Take it. Take it!

175
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:06,931
Hide it and guard it with your life.

176
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:09,546
- Come on, let's bail. Let's bail.
- Fuck.

177
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,663
So you fuckers finally found me.

178
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:26,033
Where is it, Daggers?

179
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:38,958
Who were you talking to?

180
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:40,658
I heard voices.

181
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:45,724
Why don't you go home
and tell Aeon to fuck himself!

182
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,801
It's a trap.

183
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:57,141
Well, go on then, do it,
you fuckin' pussy.

184
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:19,137
Well, that was fucked up.

185
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,783
Dude, what the hell?
It's a fucking Rick Astley record!

186
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,779
Fuck.

187
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:36,050
- What the hell was that?
- Weird.

188
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,240
It's music.

189
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,523
- Can you read it?
- Yeah, I think so. It's pretty universal.

190
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:47,058
It's really old.

191
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:49,814
Holy fuck.

192
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:52,882
- Look at the title.
- What the fuck does it say?

193
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:56,652
- I don't know, I think it's Latin.
- What, like, Dora the fuckin' Explorer?

194
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,388
No. Like, Romans and shit.

195
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,625
Dude... we should learn this,
turn it into a DEATHGASM song!

196
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,885
It'll be fuckin' brutal.

197
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:09,217
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

198
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:33,775
Vadin.

199
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:38,488
- I found Daggers.
- Straight to it?

200
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:41,424
Not even a, "How are things, Aeon?"

201
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:44,493
You're direct.
I've always liked that about you.

202
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:48,630
- Aeon, the pages.
- The Black Hymn, Vadin.

203
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,066
Pages are just paper.
The Black Hymn is absolute power.

204
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,402
Please, give it the reverence
it deserves.

205
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,371
Daggers didn't have it, The Black Hymn.

206
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,473
I think someone got to it before us.

207
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,656
That's a shame.

208
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:08,045
There was a break in.

209
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:13,061
The pages should be in Greypoint
somewhere. I just need more time.

210
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:22,820
Winners don't make excuses
for their failures, Vadin.

211
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,825
- They learn from them.
- No. Please.

212
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:28,940
- Take his fucking head off.
- No!

213
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,732
Oh, come on, that's a custom made
Sartori rug, idiots.

214
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:38,935
You put a tarp down first.

215
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,082
Do it again.

216
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:46,487
Again! Do it again!

217
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:04,691
That's good.

218
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,205
Yeah, I think that worked.

219
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:13,777
Get the car,
we're heading into Greypoint.

220
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,858
Zakk, Zakk, that's good. Brodie,
can you put your foot up on that tree?

221
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:35,439
Yeah. But... but higher. Higher.

222
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,183
This is retarded. Our instruments
aren't even plugged in.

223
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:40,164
Where the fuck is the sound
meant to be coming from?

224
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:43,349
Trust me, this is gonna be off the hook.

225
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:45,995
Yeah, yeah. No, that's good.

226
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,946
Let's head to the next location.

227
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,078
Fuck you, Dion.

228
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:41,507
Does anybody want anything
from the shop?

229
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:45,010
Condoms, Vaseline,
jumper cables and ammonium nitrate.

230
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,812
I don't think they sell
that combination of things.

231
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:50,014
See...

232
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,695
Sorry. Sorry.

233
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,131
There you go.

234
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,301
Could I please have my tampon?

235
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:05,070
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

236
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,126
- You're Brodie, right?
- Yeah.

237
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,795
I'm Medina, from maths class.

238
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:14,544
Right, you're David's girlfriend, right?

239
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:18,644
You know what, I was gonna get
an ice cream. Did you want one?

240
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:23,120
Yeah. I was just helping these guys...

241
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:30,480
We're... we're all done here.
Dude... catch you later.

242
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,476
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Cool.

243
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:39,432
Sperminate her, dude!

244
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:04,777
So... the other day, in maths...
Mr. Capenhurst is such a dick.

245
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,545
- Yeah.
- Yep.

246
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:11,461
I... I saved this.
Well, I rescued it from the bin.

247
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:16,169
You're a really good drawer, like, really
talented. I wish I could draw like that.

248
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:20,034
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.

249
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:30,231
You know, I was thinking about getting
a tattoo, it would drive my dad crazy.

250
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:33,478
I should get you to design it.

251
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,247
- Maybe that's lame.
- No, of course.

252
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:41,985
I mean, of course I would help you
design it. Not of course I think it's lame.

253
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:45,322
Okay.

254
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:48,852
You know, I was thinking
about getting it just...

255
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:50,915
just here.

256
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,996
Yes.

257
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:58,573
- Good spot for it.
- Or maybe here, on my upper thigh.

258
00:23:58,673 --> 00:24:00,621
Yeah. Yes, yeah.

259
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:04,057
Either... I mean, again,
both great areas... places.

260
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:06,558
And hard decision.

261
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,241
So.

262
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:16,083
- So, you're in a band?
- Yeah, I play... the guitar.

263
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:18,718
I mean, axe.

264
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,828
Do you... do you like metal?

265
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,841
Isn't it just a bunch of guys screaming?

266
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:31,540
No way. Well, apart from grindcore.

267
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,082
And... death metal is kind of like that.

268
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,951
And deathcore, screamo, pornogrind,

269
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:41,520
black metal, mathcore, thrash
and mordorcore. But apart from those.

270
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,788
It's just not my thing.

271
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:46,193
I don't really get it.

272
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:53,122
It's like, when life sucks,
and you feel alone and empty.

273
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:56,097
You stick on some metal
and life is better, because...

274
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:58,933
because somebody else knows the pain

275
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:02,798
and the rage that you're
going through, you know?

276
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,844
I'll lend you a CD.

277
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:17,021
You should... you should
have a... have a listen.

278
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:30,632
Anal cunt.

279
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:33,164
This one.

280
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:47,769
Awesome. These are really, really old.

281
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:49,570
How are they not in a museum?

282
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,539
Where did you say
you got these again, dude?

283
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:55,208
- I...
- Found them...

284
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:57,357
in a skip.

285
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:29,082
I'm warning you, Brodie.
Stop that devil music now.

286
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,248
Shit, man.

287
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:53,745
Laters, bud.

288
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:55,947
Dude, you choked again.

289
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,961
Sorry, I... started panicking.

290
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:01,816
You ever had that feeling
where you can't breathe?

291
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:05,419
Like there's a crushing weight on your
chest, and the room gets really small

292
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,021
and your heart starts
beating insanely fast?

293
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,360
No, I never had that.

294
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:13,625
Oh, Although this one time,
this chick grabbed my nuts too hard,

295
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,806
and my splooge came out red.

296
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:21,009
Brotherhood of Steel?

297
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:23,065
Brotherhood of Steel.

298
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:25,213
Laters.

299
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,136
The expression...

300
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,898
three A...

301
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:38,268
plus two B over two.

302
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:44,302
When A equals three...

303
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:46,300
and...

304
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,982
B equals four.

305
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:55,822
Anyway...

306
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:23,148
- Hey, cuz.
- The fuck do you want?

307
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,571
Fuck.

308
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:31,327
- Get him.
- Get the fuck off, David.

309
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:33,914
What are you gonna do about it,
fudge packer? Tell my dad?

310
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:36,142
- He hates you too.
- Fuck.

311
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:39,464
You go near my bitch again and
I'll punch you in the dick every morning.

312
00:30:39,564 --> 00:30:41,540
Fucktard.

313
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,147
- Rip Brodie's girlie earring out.
- No.

314
00:30:44,247 --> 00:30:46,962
No! No, no, no...

315
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,637
Come on. Lay into him.

316
00:31:14,537 --> 00:31:16,440
Are you stealing petrol?

317
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,489
No. I'm stealing diesel.

318
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,824
Well, don't you feel guilty?

319
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,793
No. Hold that.

320
00:31:28,447 --> 00:31:30,717
You're Zakk, right? Brodie's friend?

321
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:34,453
He... do you know where he is?
He skipped class this afternoon.

322
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,522
Brodie?

323
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,324
Oh, yeah. He lost his dick
in a freak bandsaw accident.

324
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:41,991
Tragic.

325
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:43,806
Okay.

326
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,110
Well.

327
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,034
Can you give him this?

328
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:58,083
Don't read it.

329
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,289
Zakk?

330
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:57,323
Where's Brodie?

331
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:59,945
He told me to pass on a message.

332
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:05,475
He's not interested.
He's got other shit going on.

333
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,670
- Well, that's shit.
- Yeah.

334
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,205
Well, I thought
I'd come down and tell you.

335
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:21,566
Save you waiting all night,
freezing your tits off.

336
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:27,045
Well, thank you for considering
the well-being of my tits.

337
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:28,960
You're welcome.

338
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:32,214
Here.

339
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:34,362
You're freezing.

340
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:47,111
Swig? Helps take the bullshit away.

341
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:52,275
Fuck it.

342
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,645
<i>His mum is a psycho.</i>

343
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:14,971
Are you gonna tell us
who gave you the shiner?

344
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,140
Won't matter soon.
Let's just fuckin' do this.

345
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,876
Dude, you know I have your back.
Tell me who they are, I'll fuck them up.

346
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:23,845
I'm fine.

347
00:35:24,245 --> 00:35:27,280
All right. Well, if they give you
any more shit, I know a trick, all right?

348
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,749
Point down at his zipper and say,
"Gross, your cock's hanging out."

349
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:31,884
And then when they look down... Boom!

350
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:33,983
You punch them in the face.

351
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:37,340
My dad taught me that.

352
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:41,025
All right, ladies. From the top.

353
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:30,093
Goddamn, I have the worst headache.

354
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:31,673
Were we asleep?

355
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,411
Amps are buggered.

356
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:42,535
Guys... guys, do I look different?

357
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,484
More, like... more powerful?

358
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,511
You could be weaker than before.

359
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:58,302
Something fucked up happened, man.
My head is throbbing.

360
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:04,597
Something went wrong. It didn't work.

361
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:08,067
What are you talking about, dude?

362
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:17,065
Wouldn't it be crazy if... if the music
had something to do with demons?

363
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,975
Demons?

364
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:22,377
Demons?

365
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,254
Demons?

366
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:43,248
Fuck!

367
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:47,584
- What do you want, asshole?
- Can you hear the trumpets, Brodie?

368
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:51,554
They're getting louder.
The Blind One is coming.

369
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,562
He's going to suck out your intestines
for a thousand years

370
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:57,704
and use your ribs as toothpicks.

371
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:02,001
Okay.

372
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:11,390
Did I mention... he's going to roast
your nuts over an open fire?

373
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,916
While they're still attached, of course.

374
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:17,737
- No, Terry. You didn't mention that.
- Well, he is.

375
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:50,925
Mr. Capenhurst, are you okay?

376
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,245
Oh, my God.

377
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:17,784
Oh, my God.

378
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:27,546
There was just blood everywhere,
from every hole.

379
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:30,381
- It was crazy.
- Weird.

380
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:32,282
Yeah, it was mental, man.

381
00:40:32,382 --> 00:40:36,757
Medina, too. Just...
just totally ignored me.

382
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:39,120
Did she say why?

383
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,088
No.

384
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,887
Feels like everybody in my neighborhood
has gone insane.

385
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:48,094
This town has always been fuckin' crazy.

386
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:51,899
Pouring fuckin' fluoride
in the water or something.

387
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:54,445
What the fuck is that noise?

388
00:40:56,301 --> 00:40:58,148
Dad?

389
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:02,051
For fuck's sake.

390
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:06,521
Dad?

391
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,323
Dad?

392
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:14,081
Dad, what the fuck are you doing?

393
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,383
Dad? What are you doing?

394
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:20,652
- What's wrong with him, is he drunk?
- I don't think so.

395
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:22,353
Dad, talk to me.

396
00:41:22,453 --> 00:41:25,696
Look, I want to take this T-shirt
off your face. Yeah?

397
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,978
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's okay.

398
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,706
Fuck!

399
00:41:33,729 --> 00:41:35,810
What the fuck is he doing?

400
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:41,235
- Holy fuck!
- I can see you.

401
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,160
Fuck!

402
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:27,375
Brutal.

403
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:30,124
Should we... check his pulse.

404
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:32,930
He has a fucking engine for a head.

405
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,316
I don't think he's gonna be
walking this one off, man.

406
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,264
Shit.

407
00:42:39,317 --> 00:42:42,908
Your Dad, I'm... Fuck. I'm really sorry.

408
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:47,103
Fuck!

409
00:42:54,862 --> 00:42:58,267
You know, it's weird but...

410
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:02,116
I think he would've wanted
to go out like this.

411
00:43:03,169 --> 00:43:08,040
His eyes ripped out, face grinded off,
and then head mounted under a car engine?

412
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,988
Totally.

413
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:14,687
For whom the bell tolls, old man.

414
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:19,314
Oh, fuck.

415
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:21,216
Fuck!

416
00:43:21,616 --> 00:43:25,271
Dude, dude, I am so sorry. Fuck, man.

417
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:27,683
This is all my fault. Okay. Fuck.

418
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:32,058
I translated those pages, and they were
all to do with summoning demons, okay?

419
00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:36,359
And now people are turning crazy.
Like, possessed crazy.

420
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:39,331
You knew that was some black magic shit
and you didn't fuckin' tell me?

421
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:43,040
- I didn't want you to think I was crazy.
- It's a bit fuckin' late now, isn't it?

422
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:48,004
This is fucking twisted, man.

423
00:43:48,104 --> 00:43:50,585
Fuckin' demons?

424
00:43:52,306 --> 00:43:56,543
Abigail. Fuckin' Abigail. You know, the chick
from the record store, the psychic chick.

425
00:43:56,643 --> 00:43:59,958
She knows all about this stuff.
We should go see her.

426
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,629
The lights are on.
They could still be here.

427
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,510
Well, I'm out of ideas.

428
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,490
Jesus!

429
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:46,835
These things suck.

430
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:51,449
What are you... what are you doing?

431
00:44:52,753 --> 00:44:56,655
Who brings a dice purse
to a demon apocalypse anyway?

432
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:10,847
- How do we stop these things?
- Shit.

433
00:45:17,505 --> 00:45:19,040
- Medina!
- What's up?

434
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,689
- Sweet axe skills.
- Thanks.

435
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:24,878
I wanted to come up with one-liner like,
"you were axing for this," or something.

436
00:45:24,978 --> 00:45:27,447
- That would be really cool, right?
- That was pretty cool as is.

437
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:29,595
I mean, the axe, and the...

438
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:32,964
- Yeah.
- Fuckin' awesome.

439
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:01,300
Abigail, we need to get you
to a hospital, okay?

440
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,674
It's too late.

441
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:06,357
It has possessed their bodies.

442
00:46:09,745 --> 00:46:11,513
Is that Satan?

443
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:15,682
That is Aeloth, king of the demons.

444
00:46:15,782 --> 00:46:19,051
Aeloth? Sounds like a badass.

445
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:24,055
- These words were in music pages.
- The Black Hymn. You have it.

446
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:27,610
Have it? We fuckin' played it.

447
00:46:34,227 --> 00:46:38,612
Well, then you have fucked us all.

448
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,877
The possessed bodies...

449
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:52,671
they kill all in their path...

450
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:56,180
in preparation for Aeloth's ascension...

451
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,850
on the next blood moon.

452
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:05,596
- On the devil's hour.
- Oh, shit.

453
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:08,155
The moon is red tonight.

454
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:11,770
- When is the Devil's hour?
- Three a.m.

455
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:15,193
Wait.

456
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:18,013
Three a.m. Pacific or Eastern time?

457
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:21,331
Do demons recognize daylight savings?

458
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:27,838
When Aeloth returns His soul will fuse
with that of a darkest human host.

459
00:47:28,238 --> 00:47:30,118
How can we stop him?

460
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,762
- Do you still have the Black Hymn?
- Yeah, it's back at my Uncle's.

461
00:47:33,862 --> 00:47:35,789
Well, then we can...

462
00:47:36,778 --> 00:47:38,759
Oh, shit!

463
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,197
Have you guys seen Brodie tonight?

464
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:01,999
Everyone I've seen is either
dead or psycho-ed.

465
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:06,068
No sign. Hey, my dad said we should
head to the school in an emergency.

466
00:48:06,168 --> 00:48:08,435
It's... Greypoint's
civil defense centre.

467
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:14,231
He's a warden. I mean,
was until he... got possessed and...

468
00:48:14,331 --> 00:48:17,211
- ate Mom's skin off.
- Dude, are you still going on about that?

469
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,446
It was hours ago, get the fuck over it.

470
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:21,897
Let's head to the school.
We're not gonna survive out here.

471
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:24,078
Oh, wait a sec.

472
00:48:32,555 --> 00:48:34,591
Oh, God.

473
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:37,405
Let's hope the demons can't read.

474
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,074
You ready?

475
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:45,094
Let's go.

476
00:49:10,987 --> 00:49:14,732
We need you to destroy
the Vocavitque Rex daemonia.

477
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:17,926
Destroy it? We came here to get it.

478
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:23,648
Those who performed the Black Hymn may try
to reverse it before Aeloth's ascension.

479
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:26,341
- Can't you destroy it?
- No!

480
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:31,044
Only those who still have
a soul can touch the pages.

481
00:49:31,144 --> 00:49:33,081
I do not.

482
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:36,720
I have one condition.

483
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,704
I want to become Aeloth's vessel.
It has to be me.

484
00:49:40,804 --> 00:49:46,414
His soul will bind
with the blackest human soul nearby.

485
00:49:46,514 --> 00:49:50,284
A soul that will not resist his power.

486
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:56,374
You... No! Please! No!

487
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:01,830
Now who doesn't have a gag reflex?

488
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:14,297
I pledge allegiance to Aeloth the Blind.

489
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:17,402
Kill anyone who gets in your way.

490
00:50:17,502 --> 00:50:22,186
You will be rewarded with more power
than you can imagine.

491
00:50:24,877 --> 00:50:27,732
Find Brodie. He is the key.

492
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:37,534
Before she died Abigail
was trying to tell us something.

493
00:50:41,556 --> 00:50:43,438
Maybe...

494
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,165
Okay. We're gonna back to my place,
I'm gonna get my guitar and the pages.

495
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:52,133
I'm gonna try and play this song
backwards, Rob Halford style, man.

496
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:54,201
I mean, it makes sense, right?
Reverse all this shit?

497
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,470
Fuck that. This town is shit.

498
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,072
We're going up to the lookout rolling
a three-skinner, cranking some Slayer

499
00:51:01,172 --> 00:51:04,523
and watching this town
burn to the fuckin' ground!

500
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:08,846
Dude, what about Medina, Giles and Dion?
They could all still be alive.

501
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:11,293
Those guys are dicks.

502
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:15,751
Medina is never gonna
put out for you, man.

503
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:18,386
You're never gonna get
to second base with that girl.

504
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:20,188
What?

505
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:22,423
You know, anal.

506
00:51:22,523 --> 00:51:26,060
Okay, firstly, I don't wanna know
what you think forth base is, all right?

507
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,474
But I'm going for the music pages.

508
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:35,144
Dude, fucking stop.

509
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:38,637
Don't you give a shit
about anyone but yourself?

510
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:41,730
No, I don't. Fuck them.

511
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,370
Dude, I do care about the Holden.

512
00:51:57,216 --> 00:51:59,385
Hey, Cocktopus! You win.

513
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:02,359
I'll take you to do the thing
with the music, or whatever.

514
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,368
Dude!

515
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:11,607
Come on. Get in.

516
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,583
Come on.

517
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:36,250
Okay. So all the shit
is in my room, all right.

518
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,885
But just watch out for my Aunt and Uncle,
because they hate you.

519
00:52:38,985 --> 00:52:42,521
And also... they might be demons.

520
00:52:43,122 --> 00:52:45,336
- Right.
- Okay.

521
00:52:52,762 --> 00:52:54,164
Oh, shit.

522
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:56,099
But they are into
all that God shit, right?

523
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,267
They'll be sweet,
they'll just pray themselves to safety.

524
00:52:58,367 --> 00:53:00,269
No, no.

525
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:03,272
No, they were at home
when we played the song.

526
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:07,279
Look, they definitely
would've heard it, okay?

527
00:53:19,186 --> 00:53:22,218
Looks all clear. I'll get the music.

528
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:29,411
You've been a bad boy, Brodie.

529
00:53:30,111 --> 00:53:33,945
I can taste you from here.

530
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:37,148
Zakk!

531
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,510
Fuck!

532
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:03,868
Shit. We need to arm up.

533
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:11,433
- Does your uncle have a gun?
- I doubt it, man. Fuck!

534
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:14,293
Fuck. Fuck, yes!

535
00:54:14,593 --> 00:54:17,870
I bet there are some crosses in here.
Or some bibles we could bash them with.

536
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,066
What the hell?

537
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:23,948
I think they're...
they're rosary beads? Yeah.

538
00:54:26,103 --> 00:54:29,118
What part of church do they crank
this bad boy, Brodie?

539
00:54:31,808 --> 00:54:34,243
- Hey, Brodie?
- What?

540
00:54:34,343 --> 00:54:36,390
Oh, fuck.

541
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:39,827
Why would you do that?

542
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:24,329
It's not working.

543
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,856
These are a bit shit.

544
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:29,903
- Hold them off.
- What?

545
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,945
Yes.

546
00:55:58,346 --> 00:56:00,147
Brodie!

547
00:56:00,247 --> 00:56:01,894
No!

548
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:29,981
No! No!

549
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:33,071
No! No! No!

550
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,586
No!

551
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:40,388
I'm going to eat your soul.

552
00:56:58,891 --> 00:57:01,890
Fucking die!

553
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,368
No!

554
00:57:13,468 --> 00:57:16,988
No! Stop! Please. No!

555
00:58:04,879 --> 00:58:06,627
No.

556
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:10,063
No.

557
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,188
What... the fuck?

558
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:07,971
- Pretty sure he wasn't possessed.
- What? Oh, no. Of course he was.

559
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:12,822
Because when he came in
he said something about Satan.

560
00:59:13,975 --> 00:59:16,191
You didn't hear him say that?

561
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:32,203
Fuck!

562
00:59:34,624 --> 00:59:37,661
Hey, the pages are blowing away.
You have to help me...

563
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:40,096
Oh, sick, man.

564
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:43,831
- What? They were like that when I found them.
- Come on. We have to get the music.

565
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:47,768
All right, look I'm going to help you
do this, but only because you suck at it.

566
00:59:47,868 --> 00:59:52,250
Also it's kind of fun stabbing shit.
But we need to get better weapons. Yeah?

567
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:06,661
- Brutal.
- Brutal as fuck.

568
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:52,027
You're pretty good
at whacking guys off, bro.

569
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:14,059
Did you see that?

570
01:01:14,741 --> 01:01:18,277
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Brodie, you've got the page, let's go.

571
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:20,490
Brodie!

572
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,563
Shit!

573
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,385
Medina.

574
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,242
Brodie.

575
01:01:32,653 --> 01:01:35,689
- Hey.
- Hey.

576
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:38,822
We're just holed up in... inside.

577
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:40,560
We?

578
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,704
When Medina was killing those demons...

579
01:01:43,804 --> 01:01:45,597
I got a bit of a half-chub.

580
01:01:45,697 --> 01:01:48,099
Look, let's get back
to the matter at hand here.

581
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:50,935
Seeing as how you're in an underground
dwarven citadel,

582
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:53,816
it looks as if it has
nested hinges, which...

583
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:55,673
Oh... Brodie!

584
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:58,975
- Told you they'd be okay.
- No, you didn't.

585
01:01:59,075 --> 01:02:02,277
You said they were probably dead already.
You wanted dibs on his guitar.

586
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:06,815
- I found these guys outside your house.
- You were looking for us?

587
01:02:06,915 --> 01:02:10,218
Of course. You got our note, right?

588
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,254
No. I didn't see any note.

589
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:40,189
Who would have thought that Mr. Proctor's
rock collection would come in handy?

590
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,913
- Oh, gosh. Your hand.
- Oh... it's okay.

591
01:02:45,113 --> 01:02:46,527
No.

592
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:54,679
That's Zakk's jacket.

593
01:02:55,754 --> 01:02:58,136
When did you get that?

594
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:02,661
He...

595
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:05,994
He lent it to me.

596
01:03:06,664 --> 01:03:10,735
He stopped by the other night
to tell me that...

597
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:13,837
you know.

598
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:16,720
You weren't interested.

599
01:03:18,372 --> 01:03:20,075
What?

600
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:24,312
The note that I gave Zakk to give to you
to meet me at the park at 9:00.

601
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:27,894
No. I didn't get that note either.

602
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:35,500
So...

603
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:40,087
did you guys hook up?

604
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,662
- Motherfucker!
- Brodie, just leave it.

605
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:51,745
Fuckin' wanker. You knew I liked her.

606
01:03:51,845 --> 01:03:54,801
Calm the fuck down, all right?

607
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:56,669
I'm not even into her; I was just bored.

608
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:59,038
Well. That's supposed
to make it fuckin' better?

609
01:03:59,138 --> 01:04:01,597
What happened to Brotherhood of Steel?

610
01:04:01,697 --> 01:04:04,248
Everyone was fuckin' right about you.
You're a piece of shit.

611
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:09,387
Fuck you! You let this happen
by being such an insecure pussy.

612
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:16,499
Yeah, that's right walk away.
Grow some fucking balls, man.

613
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:23,170
Motherfucker!

614
01:04:29,828 --> 01:04:31,997
You motherfucker. You knew I liked her.

615
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,162
Save it for the demons, you two.

616
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,633
All right.

617
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:39,615
All right.

618
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:51,278
Fuck you!

619
01:04:51,578 --> 01:04:54,117
I never even liked you.

620
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:04,547
Good luck fighting evil without me.
You're all gonna fuckin' die.

621
01:05:09,325 --> 01:05:11,757
Death to false metal!

622
01:05:15,464 --> 01:05:17,000
I expected this.

623
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,370
He's Chaotic Neutral
and you're Lawful Good.

624
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:24,152
Your alignments
are just totally mismatched.

625
01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:38,451
How are we gonna play it backwards?
It was hard enough playing it forwards.

626
01:05:38,551 --> 01:05:40,586
Will take a few goes.

627
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:43,217
- Well, time isn't exactly on our side.
- And another problem.

628
01:05:43,317 --> 01:05:46,623
When we first played the song, everyone in
the neighborhood got possessed first, right?

629
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:49,425
- So?
- Well, they were all within earshot.

630
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:51,260
But our amps blew up.

631
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,529
Right. Okay, so we need
some serious decibels.

632
01:05:53,629 --> 01:05:55,945
- Well, does the school have any?
- Are you kidding?

633
01:05:56,045 --> 01:06:00,501
Our whole music class had to share
the same recorder. I can still taste it.

634
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:02,153
I know a place that has amps.

635
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:05,505
Big ones. Not sure if they still work,
but it's our only chance.

636
01:06:05,605 --> 01:06:10,041
Out there? It's gonna be crazy.
And we don't have a car without Zakk.

637
01:06:10,141 --> 01:06:14,010
Zakk can eat my ass. We don't need him.
We can do it on our own.

638
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,224
Fuck, yeah.

639
01:06:19,332 --> 01:06:21,182
Fuck, yeah.

640
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:23,330
Let's tear shit up.

641
01:06:31,652 --> 01:06:33,460
Stay low.

642
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,213
Come on.

643
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:50,459
- Just chill, all right. We're not demons.
- Drop the weapons. Now.

644
01:06:53,408 --> 01:06:57,057
Damn! I can't tell if I have
a fear boner or a boner boner.

645
01:06:58,846 --> 01:07:01,548
- I didn't even say anything. Hit him.
- Just let us go, okay.

646
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:05,118
You don't know what you're doing.
The town is overrun with fucking demons.

647
01:07:05,218 --> 01:07:08,121
We know exactly what we are doing.

648
01:07:08,221 --> 01:07:10,523
Give me the Vogue-catty
queff-wrecks-demony.

649
01:07:10,623 --> 01:07:13,356
It's actually pronounced
Vocavitque Rex daemonia.

650
01:07:13,456 --> 01:07:15,861
That tongue wasn't meant for Latin.

651
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:20,164
- Come on.
- The Black Hymn, where is it?

652
01:07:20,264 --> 01:07:22,779
I don't know what you talking about. No.

653
01:07:26,635 --> 01:07:27,694
Well?

654
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:31,671
Don't tell this Manson family
cumbucket anything, Brodie.

655
01:07:31,771 --> 01:07:33,687
Okay, okay.

656
01:07:36,742 --> 01:07:38,085
It's here.

657
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,293
No!

658
01:07:48,317 --> 01:07:52,018
Tie them up, take them in the bedroom.
They can be a live offering for Aeloth.

659
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:54,924
No. No, please, let us go.

660
01:07:55,024 --> 01:07:58,593
You had your chance.
You awakened Aeloth,

661
01:07:58,693 --> 01:08:02,963
pleaded with him to take away
your weakness and vanquish your enemies.

662
01:08:03,063 --> 01:08:09,328
He would've given you power, fame,
fortune, and any woman you want.

663
01:08:10,269 --> 01:08:11,637
But you blew it.

664
01:08:11,737 --> 01:08:14,573
Is that true Brodie?
You did all of this for power?

665
01:08:15,173 --> 01:08:16,875
- I didn't want this.
- Get them out.

666
01:08:17,975 --> 01:08:19,490
Okay. Okay, okay.

667
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:33,569
Do you think if we soil our pants,
they'll let us go?

668
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,964
I guess we'll find out soon.

669
01:08:42,029 --> 01:08:44,898
In sanguine. Intra in sanguinem.

670
01:08:44,998 --> 01:08:49,268
De caelo laceri. Lacerato horrorem.

671
01:08:49,368 --> 01:08:54,071
Proin cursus meum.
Regnabunt autem in sanguine...

672
01:08:54,605 --> 01:08:59,158
Hey, I never meant for this to happen,
okay? I just want to let you know that.

673
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:02,923
I was desperate.

674
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:06,726
I just... I felt so fuckin' powerless.

675
01:09:12,484 --> 01:09:15,257
You are not powerless, Brodie.

676
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:18,483
You can till stop this.

677
01:09:19,124 --> 01:09:20,651
I know you can.

678
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,524
What was that, guys?

679
01:09:27,895 --> 01:09:29,230
Shit.

680
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,011
There's something in there.

681
01:09:46,244 --> 01:09:51,761
Which one of you cunts
wants to be skull-fucked first?

682
01:09:58,753 --> 01:10:02,769
No, no. Not me.
I need my skull for exams.

683
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:08,561
Sacrifice is a noble act, you know.

684
01:10:09,129 --> 01:10:11,368
Fucking old bastard.

685
01:10:12,698 --> 01:10:14,180
Oh, my God.

686
01:10:30,578 --> 01:10:32,592
Did you miss me?

687
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:47,947
I thought you were off to the lookout
to watch the town burn.

688
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:50,395
Realized I couldn't leave
my mate in the shit.

689
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:53,077
Not with all these demons to mega-kill.

690
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,956
Metalheads stick together, right?

691
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:06,509
Wait. You decided
that you wanted to help us,

692
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:08,800
and then you went and applied makeup?

693
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:11,411
Well, how long did it take?
What ten, fifteen minutes?

694
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:14,713
It's not makeup, it's fucking
corpse paint. For going into battle?

695
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:19,030
Okay. Well, you look adorable.
It really brings out your eyes.

696
01:11:21,418 --> 01:11:23,587
- What's the plan?
- Okay. I get my guitar.

697
01:11:23,687 --> 01:11:27,089
- You guys get me to the amps. Cover me.
- But she ripped up the pages.

698
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:30,225
Do you really think you can
play it from memory?

699
01:11:30,325 --> 01:11:32,539
I have to try.

700
01:11:34,193 --> 01:11:38,109
One more thing...
can you quickly pull me off?

701
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:45,447
Right.

702
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:50,917
De caelo laceri. Lacerato horrorem.

703
01:11:57,709 --> 01:12:00,556
Metal up your ass, motherfucker!

704
01:12:32,969 --> 01:12:34,416
No!

705
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:43,466
- Where's Dion?
- He was behind us. He must've got lost.

706
01:12:43,566 --> 01:12:45,305
There's only a few fucking rooms.

707
01:12:46,212 --> 01:12:47,925
Dion!

708
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:17,916
Fuck!

709
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:26,890
Giles!

710
01:14:20,558 --> 01:14:23,060
- Hurry, Brodie.
- I'm trying.

711
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,641
Kill them all!

712
01:15:11,538 --> 01:15:13,187
It's three a.m.

713
01:15:33,924 --> 01:15:37,941
Aeloth! Come into me!

714
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:42,572
Fill me with your power!

715
01:16:17,663 --> 01:16:19,765
So much power!

716
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:21,813
This is fucking brutal.

717
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:28,785
What?

718
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:35,409
Fuck.

719
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:39,003
You know, I'm not even sure
I'm in the right tuning.

720
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:58,928
So, dude, I'm thinking
about doing a 'Burzum'.

721
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:02,211
Starting my own solo project.

722
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:12,681
Medina! Run! Run!

723
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:18,376
I mean, you and the rest of the band
are just dead weight.

724
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:22,616
Dude, zip up your fly.
I can see your dong.

725
01:17:22,716 --> 01:17:24,326
What?

726
01:17:29,584 --> 01:17:32,319
You don't get it, do you?
You can't stop me.

727
01:17:32,419 --> 01:17:37,002
I'm gonna destroy this world of shit,
one maggot at a time.

728
01:17:42,259 --> 01:17:44,007
Medina!

729
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,341
Look at it this way...

730
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:01,410
you're about to lose five kgs
without a crash diet.

731
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,456
Fuck it.

732
01:18:11,847 --> 01:18:14,646
No, no, no, no. That's not gonna work.

733
01:18:15,318 --> 01:18:18,707
You have to play the black hymn,
fuckin' idiot.

734
01:18:58,288 --> 01:18:59,703
Zakk.

735
01:19:01,624 --> 01:19:03,560
Thanks, man.

736
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:06,124
The metal brought me back.

737
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,181
I'm trying to hold him off.

738
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:19,127
- He's gonna destroy everything.
- Dude, fight it.

739
01:19:19,227 --> 01:19:23,086
You gotta be strong. I mean,
you're the strong one, remember?

740
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,179
I can't. He's too powerful.

741
01:19:29,176 --> 01:19:31,225
Finish me.

742
01:19:31,325 --> 01:19:35,120
Quickly. Before Aeloth takes over again.

743
01:19:36,714 --> 01:19:38,895
Man, I can't, I can't.

744
01:19:41,984 --> 01:19:45,233
You have to do it. There's no other way.
Send him back to hell.

745
01:19:48,888 --> 01:19:50,929
Do it!

746
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,867
Brotherhood of steel, dude.

747
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:32,312
Brotherhood of steel, forever.

748
01:21:01,018 --> 01:21:03,078
I don't know, I just...

749
01:21:04,022 --> 01:21:06,324
I can't stand mic cupping.

750
01:21:06,424 --> 01:21:11,234
- Cannibal Corpse do it.
- No. Barnes used to do it. Fisher...

751
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:13,564
it's straight from the guts.

752
01:21:13,664 --> 01:21:17,333
Shit. Did I just get schooled?

753
01:21:17,433 --> 01:21:20,314
I'm a very fast learner.

754
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:22,981
How's the tat?

755
01:21:23,836 --> 01:21:25,850
It's all healed up.

756
01:21:29,506 --> 01:21:31,535
I'll see you later.

757
01:21:58,232 --> 01:22:02,335
You really thought this was over?
Time to die, Brodie!

758
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:12,157
- No, just kidding, dude.
- Zakk?

759
01:25:18,594 --> 01:25:21,598
So what's like... being dead?

760
01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:23,867
<i>Hell is awesome!</i>

761
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:25,735
<i>Like, met some music legends:</i>

762
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:28,237
<i>Dio, Kurt Cobain, Dimebag,</i>

763
01:25:28,337 --> 01:25:31,372
<i>Jon Bonham, Paul McCartney.</i>

764
01:25:31,638 --> 01:25:36,143
<i>Yeah, the true, true Mayhem
reunited, too. So cold, dude.</i>

765
01:25:36,443 --> 01:25:38,943
Fucking brutal as.

766
01:25:39,043 --> 01:25:40,313
<i>Anyway, the band.</i>

767
01:25:40,513 --> 01:25:42,715
<i>You got to keep playing, dude.</i>

768
01:25:43,383 --> 01:25:47,152
But everyone is dead. We can't keep
calling ourselves DEATHGASM.

769
01:25:47,252 --> 01:25:48,634
Doesn't feel right.

770
01:25:48,734 --> 01:25:53,124
<i>All right then. Well, change it.
How about... Bandsaw Circumcision?</i>

771
01:25:53,224 --> 01:25:56,660
- Intesticide?
- <i>What about, like, Bestiality Bliss?</i>

772
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,129
Yeah, how about Birth Canal Boat Riders?

773
01:25:59,229 --> 01:26:01,397
<i>What about The God Buggerers?</i>

774
01:26:01,497 --> 01:26:05,279
- How about David Bain's Scrotum.
- <i>Anal Bulimia?</i>
