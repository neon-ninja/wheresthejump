<i> I think again because of the brutality
of the killing here, the circumstances...</i>

00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,077
Out top story tonight. A salvage murder
in the 4th parish has brought the locals there..

00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:58,292
 <i>...shaping up as one of the most

four of her friends before hanging herself...</i>

<i>in what the authorities are calling 
a ritualistic murder...</i>

7
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:12,010

It's the biggest thing that happens  since Lizzie Borden</i>

<i>5 young people killed as part of a
bizarre satanic ritual...</i>

<i>WFAL7 Jean Stanton, is live at 
Lawford parish with that story...</i>

10
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,814
<i>Neighbors said they are puzzled that someone they described
as quiet and who kept to herself could be capable of the.. </i>.

11
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:32,125
<i>Those around this area surely remembered the
Martha Livingston murders that shocked all..</i>

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,719
<i>More than twenty years after the
Livingston murders, some ...</i>

13
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:39,772

played a role in those murders..</i>

"Who lived here and why did they moved</i>

17
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,594

- <i>.. Someone says</i>

18
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:59,095
<i> that ghosts are nothing more than 
lost souls who were stuck in their sorrows...</i>.

19
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,517
<i>But whatever you believe about 
the afterlife, it's undeniable </i>

20
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:06,798
<i>that something horrific happened 
in this house all those years ago...</i>

21
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,747
I'll be there.

22
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:39,635
I said I'll be there.

23
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:43,325
Why am I in a bad mood?

24
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:48,571
Uh... Deb heard noises next door,
wanted me to check it out.

25
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:49,970
Yeah.

26
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:52,591
Livingston House.

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,830
No, it's completely quiet.

28
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,023
I'll call you back.

29
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,671
This is probably a stupid question,
but this is the best you got?

30
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,467
-  Very stupid question.
- Huh, ha, ha, ha.  I'll take it.

31
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:06,433
- Hello.
- Hi Detective. Sorry to bother you but I got a call

32
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,527
about a disturbance from the 4 LaForte Road
out by the section of the swarm.

33
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:12,623
We need immediately assistance and
my closest officer is 20 minutes out.

34
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,101
Uh no. That's alright Margery,
I'm 2 minutes away I'll take it.

35
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:17,503
Sorry, to bother you. 
I know you had a date tonight.

36
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:21,151
If only the bad guys respected 
my social calendar.

37
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,601
Halt!

38
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:17,765
Goddamn it, Leonard.
You scared the shit out of me.

39
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,822
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,032
- What the hell is going on?
- There's blood in there.

41
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:27,993
- Stay here. Do not move.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,986
Police!

43
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:39,153
Police.

44
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:22,857
This is detective Lewis. Requesting backup
and EMS vehicles at number 4 LaForte Road.

45
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,215
I repeat. I need backup and
EMS vehicles at number 4 LaForte Road.

46
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,778
- Copy that.

47
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,485
Police!

48
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,259
Margery, where...

49
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:44,065
Police! Hold it boy.
Stop. I said stop.

50
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,855
Stop...!

51
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:51,323
Stay down.
Stay down.

52
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:54,983
Alright.
Alright, alright.

53
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,948
You okay?

54
00:08:56,973 --> 00:09:00,241
Look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me. You okay?

55
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,640
Alright.
You're okay.

56
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:05,142
You're okay...

57
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,659
ONE WEEK EARLIER

58
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,097
Are you okay?

59
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,608
John?

60
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,076
John?

61
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,905
Are you okay?

62
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:25,602
Are you gonna answer my brother?

63
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,405
Yeah. Sorry man,
what was the question?

64
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,837
You were talking about
what you saw in the house.

65
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:35,955
You said you were
having visions of her.

66
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,259
I just want to clarify who the 'her' was.

67
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:42,029
Was it one of the victims, or uh..

68
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:44,083
-... the owner of the house?
- No.

69
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,577
No, it was my mum.

70
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,659
She died a few years ago,
and uh...

71
00:09:56,116 --> 00:10:02,506
 I don't know. I just keep...
seeing her in this house...

72
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:04,883
but I've never been inside of it before.

73
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,241
She's... sitting there.

74
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,467
Smiling.

75
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:16,231
Telling me to let go.

76
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:20,766
She is younger than I remembered her.
She's closer to my age.

77
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,284
And you've always had these visions?

78
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,823
 No, only just started a few months ago.

79
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:30,550
This is a... 
This is really great stuff.

80
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:32,859
Bryan's going to love this.

81
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:34,856
Bryan?

82
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:37,387
Yeah, Bryan Purcell.

83
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:46,177
Hey. Hey, please don't walk away from this.
I feel like we are actually getting somewhere.

84
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:49,250
-Why didn't you tell me that Bryan was involved?
- Because I didn't think it mattered.

85
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:51,826
You didn't think that it matter that
your ex-boyfriend was coming along?

86
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,809
It's was three years ago.

87
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:59,738
Look. I was going to tell you, but I needed
to know if you would come first.

88
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:04,335
Hey, look. Sam, I appreciate what
you're trying to do man, but I uh....

89
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,425
- I don't this stuff to cure my nightmares okay.
- Okay.

90
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,403
But visions like this aren't just going to go away
unless we really hit them head on.

91
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:14,681
- What does that mean head on?
- It means we go to the house.

92
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,509
Once inside of it, we'll
evaluate your connection.

93
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:20,065
See if these visions have any sense of
realistic within the structure itself.

94
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,466
Yeah.
Bryan?

95
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:25,407
Bryan, Jules and Donnie would be there
to evaluate the paranormal aspects..

96
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:28,026
They believe that where there were victims,
there are spirits.

97
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,167
No.

98
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:33,624
Bryan does not care about victims,
or spirits, or anything going on with me, okay.

99
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,434
He is an opportunist who only
cares about capturing ghost on tape,

100
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,079
so that he can make as
much money out of it as he can.

101
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:42,760
Which is why he is going to insist,
we go with or without you.

102
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:47,824
Look. A lot of unexplained things happened
in that house all those years ago.

103
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:51,491
I think that when your mother heard about it,
it stucked with her.

104
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:54,865
I think those things haunted her.
like they are haunting you.

105
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,534
But hey. Don't listen to me to me.

106
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,136
It's your mom.
She's the one telling you to let go.

107
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,519
You haven't slept in weeks.

108
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,663
I understand your skepticism,

109
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,768
and this might not work.
But what if it does?

110
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,129
Just try it.

111
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,180
Please.

112
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:24,931
Her name is Michelle Chapman.
We think she's the suspect's girlfriend.

113
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:27,185
No sign of her yet but we
did find her purse inside.

114
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,089
- Let me try to pull the prints from the murder weapon.
- Alright.

115
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:32,616
- Don’t hang around on my account. Go find some prints.
- Yes sir.

116
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:34,350
Here, here, here...

117
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:44,258
- How many are there?
- So far 13 cameras.

118
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:47,023
Almost the entire house is covered,
but we're not seeing anything.

119
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,146
- God damn it. Erased?
- No. Scrambled. Dead air.

120
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,100
There's recorded information but...

121
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,991
We got a mass murderer from that many angles, and
you are telling me we don't have a single thing?

122
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:59,649
- I have a good feeling about this.
- Henry, what are you doing with the freezer?

123
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:02,507
- Sometimes freezing the drives helps the data recovery.
- Henry...

124
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,319
... there's going to be more murders
if you screw up those drives.

125
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,748
I'm telling you right now.

126
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:07,266
Look. We'll bagged it.

127
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:10,258
And we'll try to defragment the data files and
see if we can recovery anything but...

128
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:13,794
6 drives, 2 terabytes full of raw data
could take sometime.

129
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,777
- Hey, Percy.
- Hey, Percy.

130
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:35,311
- His rights been read?
- Yes sir. Reeves got it.

131
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:47,953
How are you doing, John?

132
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,689
- Have you found Michelle yet?
- Not yet, so...

133
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:56,090
Hoping you could help us with that.

134
00:13:56,115 --> 00:14:00,477
- He took her. He took her away.
- Who took her?

135
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,757
I got to go find her. 
'Cos he couldn’t have gone far.

136
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:07,064
How many of you were there, John. 6?
Were there 6 of you?

137
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,133
Are you listening to me?

138
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:12,517
You got to get out there and...
find her.

139
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:15,712
We're looking for Michelle right now.
I promise you that.

140
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,915
But what I need from you right now is...
tell me who is missing?

141
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:24,810
John, look at these photos right here.
And tell me who is missing?

142
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:32,975
- Bryan Purcell.
- Bryan Purcell.

143
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:40,101
- When's the last time you saw Bryan?
- I don't know.

144
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,522
You don't know?
You said he took her. Where did he take her?

145
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:45,000
- I don't know.
- Where?

146
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,914
- It happened so fast. I don't know.
- Did Bryan Purcell kill these people, here?

147
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,173
Did he kill your friends?

148
00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:53,850
No?

149
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,157
It was the house.

150
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,624
It was the house.

151
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,598
The house did...
did something to him.

152
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:05,005
"The house did something to him."

153
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:09,486
If that could hold up in the court of the law, John.
You know...

154
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,846
Usually convicted houses 
in the state Louisiana.

155
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,305
This house is different.

156
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,305
What were you doing
in the house, John?

157
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,020
They woke it up.
They...

158
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,714
They try to contact to the other side
and they woke it up.

159
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:26,595
They woke it up.
They woke up the house.

160
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,890
I only did it for Michelle.

161
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,164
It's my fault. Please be alive.
- John....

162
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:33,490
Please be alive.

163
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,788
Listen to me John.
I need you to stay calm, okay.

164
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:40,271
If it was Bryan.You have to find him.
Before he hurts Michelle.

165
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:41,963
Okay.
You have to find him!

166
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:45,729
- We will.
- Please... Please...

167
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:49,400
Please.

168
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:57,871
Detective. No prints on the axe.
Wiped clean.

169
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:00,969
There can't be any prints on the axe, Jenkins.
The house did it.

170
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,193
Sir?

171
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:04,667
- Never mind.
- You want me to bring him to the station?

172
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:06,837
Uh..no. I want you to keep him here.

173
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:09,792
We got two people out there,
could be victims, could be killers.

174
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:11,841
Right now this guy is my only shoot
at putting this thing together

175
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:14,236
- So I want him close to me, yeah.
- Yes sir.

176
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:17,169
- Keep him here...  Okay.
- Yes sir.

177
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,401
Dispatch.
That's a negative on the transport.

178
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:40,581
- Hi.
- Hey.

179
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:44,378
- It's... it's me. You busy?
- Yeah, I'm busy being stood up.

180
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,016
- I'm sorry about that, something came up.
- Two hours I've been waiting , Lewis.

181
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,585
If you could just let me 
get a word in.

182
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,690
I got a triple homicide here
in the Livingston house.

183
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,076
What?

184
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,716
- Martha Livingston?
- Yeah.

185
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,694
Do you have someone in custody?

186
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:05,480
I do. I do. But uh...he's in shock right now.
Says he can't remembers anything

187
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:08,993
Plus I got 2 people who are missing,
the entire force is looking for.

188
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:13,263
- Oh. Copycat crime maybe.
- No, no... no maybe.

189
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:16,647
- Kid saying they woke the house up.
- Huh.

190
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,586
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm on my way.

191
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:20,651
- Alright good, it's a date.

192
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:24,393
No, no. It was suppose to be a date.
It's definitely not a date.

193
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,331
- Reeves.
- Yes sir.

194
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:32,086
Get everything you can on
the Livingston case, okay.

195
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:33,730
Yes, yes sir.

196
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,214
Hello... it's Jules here.
I'm in the car... waiting. So bored.

197
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,797
- Bryan, say something.
- Uh.   (car horn)

198
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:51,537
Where are they?

199
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:53,398
Speak of the devil.

200
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,599
Let's go,
you lovebirds.

201
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:01,131
Hey.

202
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,762
Donnie.

203
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:04,176
Donnie.

204
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:08,801
You didn't speak with real people today.
You okay with that?

205
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:12,867
- Don’t waste the batteries, Jules.
- Give me the camera.

206
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:17,537
- Hey guys.
- Jules.

207
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:21,395
- Good morning, Michelle.  Good morning John.
- Hi.

208
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,424
You guys are perfect for each other.
Matching haircuts and everything.

209
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:28,450
Oh... your's looks like a wet dog.

210
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:32,911
Truth. - You're the third John Michelle dated
since she's been with me. So...

211
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:38,208
Truth.- It's so clear that you're not over Michelle,
and it's really embarrassing for you, man.

212
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:39,902
Nice bangs (hair).

213
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:43,812
Hey. Even though you're not the first,
but definitely the most interesting.

214
00:18:43,837 --> 00:18:46,363
A honest to god, a haunted house
in the mounts of Louisiana?

215
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:47,510
It's not a haunted
house, Bryan.

216
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,889
- Let's go find out.
- Bryan. Lay off.

217
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:54,747
- Hey. Your eyes look great on film.
- Those aren't my eyes, Bryan.

218
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:01,888
That's something.
Anything from inside the house?

219
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:03,928
Nothing yet. 
Still working on it.

220
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:06,414
Jenkins, where're we at on the
background for the Purcell kid?

221
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,775
Should have it any minute.

222
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:10,991
- Detective Klein just landed.
She 's walking up.

223
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,866
Good, good,
good, good.

224
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:15,892
Hey.

225
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:18,519
Good excuse to miss date night.

226
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:21,296
- Ha. It's called a phone call.
- I know.

227
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,872
I mean, assuming you can get this
guy to make some sense.

228
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,976
Because right now he's just mumbling
about how the house did it.

229
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:30,149
- I'm sure you are very understanding about that.
- Seeing how I don't even like when you read my horoscope.

230
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:32,941
No, I'm not interested in talking about
the house is a murder suspect.

231
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,886
- So, where is he?
- What? Wait.

232
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:37,982
When this is all over.
I still got a bottle of wine in my car.

233
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:42,468
I tell you what. I'll share that wine with you,
if you let me read your horoscope. How's that?

234
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:44,369
- Not a chance.
- Hm.

235
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:51,166
Klein.

236
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,572
Henry.

237
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:56,347
John.
This is Dr. Elizabeth Klein.

238
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:59,169
She's the department psychologist.

239
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:02,678
Hello, John.
I'm Elizabeth.

240
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,292
How're you doing, huh?

241
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,928
I'm going to let you two talk.

242
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:09,353
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

243
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:11,718
Hey.

244
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:15,247
You might be in a
little bit of shock.

245
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:18,595
- Henry, can you get me the blanket please.
- Of course.

246
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,605
After a traumatic experience like this,
most people shut down.

247
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,921
So you are not alone.

248
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:32,769
But the thing that gets most people moving
is to have a strong purpose

249
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:36,417
Let me show you that purpose.
Can you do that John?

250
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,036
Can you?

251
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,769
I never should have told her
 about this place.

252
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:54,691
Who shouldn't you have told that?
Michelle?

253
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:56,516
She...

254
00:20:57,251 --> 00:21:00,386
She used to...
hang out with them.

255
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:03,038
Before I met her.

256
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,795
'Hunting ghosts',
they called it.

257
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,845
Is that what they were here for?

258
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,306
Hey, the police said you blacked out.
It's probably from the shock.

259
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:22,292
Is there anything at all that you can tell me,
that you remember?

260
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:27,104
I can remember some stuff 
from earlier today.

261
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:32,366
Why don't you walk me through what you remember.
Maybe it'll help to bring something up.

262
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,716
I can try.

263
00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:43,284
Alright.
A little introduction here.

264
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:49,029
Samuel B. Chapman. Looking very serious
and smart with his energy drink.

265
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:52,917
Jules Carter, our occult specialist /
research guru.

266
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,649
- I'm also a sexy bitch.
- That you are.

267
00:21:55,674 --> 00:22:00,947
Donald Smith, technological connoisseur
and resident mouth breather.

268
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:02,562
Alright.
Alright...

269
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,437
Do it.
Go...

270
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:09,858
- Go. Put your meat in his mouth.
- He's taking it.

271
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,258
I'm waiting.

272
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:17,008
Damn redneck, hillbillies.

273
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:29,298
So tell us what's been happening with you.

274
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,037
Uh well...

275
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:35,923
The house that we're going to is in a
small town where my mom grew up.

276
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:41,222
And... about 25 years ago,
there was an incident.

277
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,771
I think they called it mass murder.

278
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:47,445
Yeah. 
The Martha Livingston murders.

279
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,656
But no one lived in the house since.

280
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:51,217
How you know the house?

281
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:55,294
Growing up, my mom was kind of
friends with Martha Livingston.

282
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,078
The girl who lived there
and, who...you know..

283
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:01,022
Did she ever talked to you
about the murders?

284
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:06,338
No, no. No one talk about it.
I think the whole town just want it to go away.

285
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:09,247
You don't think this is real, do you?

286
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:10,442
No.

287
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,900
I think we actually do the things
that we can say we can do, right?

288
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,671
- Bryan, easy up man. This is just an interview.
- Shut the hell up.

289
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:17,461
I just want to know why this guy
always acts he's too cool for all of us.

290
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,238
Not all of you, Bryan.

291
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:23,470
Fuck. You know what I think.
I think you're actually curious about this house.

292
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:26,073
You think there's some kind of connection
 that you can't fully explain.

293
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:30,418
You don't believe any of this, of course.
 Because we're all full of shit. And here you are.

294
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:33,825
So why don't you admit that deep down 
you hope that we can make sense of this for you.

295
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,257
Bryan, stop.

296
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,886
You don't have to come here with us.
You know that.

297
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:42,431
They were gonna edit a documentary,
trying to capture spirits on film.

298
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:48,208
So. Once you got to the house.
Did you manage to capture spirits?

299
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:54,234
Oh.
Alright.

300
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:57,801
- Watch the mud.
- Yeah. Watch your shoes.

301
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,386
What are those?

302
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,792
I think they're Abilene chimes.

303
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,443
- Suppose to beckon the dead.
- There's more.

304
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:10,001
Holy shit.

305
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:15,010
- Am I crazy? I don't feel any wind.
- It's acting weird.

306
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:20,339
Aw...!

307
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,756
- What. Are you okay?
- Aw.

308
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:24,588
- What happened?
- Aw...

309
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:27,225
You guys...
 are so gullible.

310
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,779
- Oh... my god.
- Ha, ha, ha. You make funny jokes.

311
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:33,636
What?
No?

312
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:34,847
Come on.

313
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:36,888
- You like it.
- No.

314
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:38,972
- Tough crowd.
- Let's go.

315
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,894
Donnie, catch up.

316
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,004
Is this real?

317
00:25:17,738 --> 00:25:19,699
Ah...
Jesus.

318
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,748
- At least this house isn't open to visitors.
- Why you say that?

319
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,322
That gas lamp dates back to 1800s.

320
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:30,868
Used to use as a few passing by on the road
could see if the master of the house is home.

321
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:35,375
- It was open for guest, when it was lit, meant it was.
- I promise we'll be good guest.

322
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:38,038
Let's uh... be up and running in an hour.
Yeah.

323
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:41,658
Thing is going to take sometime, I don't really
want to stay here longer than we have to.

324
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:45,066
- What thing?
- It's an evocation. It's like a seance.

325
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:48,221
We try to summon the spirits to see
if you could get the victims to communicate.

326
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:51,314
What if we summon Martha
Livingston instead?

327
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:55,108
We won't, because among other precautions.
We're only going to use good energies to summon.

328
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,999
Good energy.

329
00:25:56,024 --> 00:25:57,628
- Yeah.
- Alright.

330
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:59,992
So let me see if I have this straight?

331
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:04,042
You guys came to the house to do a seance
to communicate with the dead.

332
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:11,637
And it's so happens that Martha Livingston and her friends
also did a seance in this house 2 decades ago.

333
00:26:13,027 --> 00:26:15,206
Do you see what I'm getting at?

334
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:26,155
It seems that someone intended to repeat
the murders in exactly the same way.

335
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,046
That happened 20 years ago.

336
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:39,184
I don't know if it's Bryan Purcell,
or someone else or you.

337
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:45,059
But the truth is if we don't to the bottom of this,
you are looking at spending the rest of your life in prison.

338
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,135
And I've to tell you when that happens,
I'm not going to be able to help you anymore.

339
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,811
I just... I just....
I want to remember.

340
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:59,476
All I care about is that they find Michelle.

341
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:02,583
And...
And that she's alive.

342
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:07,559
So tell me.
How did you get inside the house?

343
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:34,102
- Oh my god, this place is awesome.
- Alright.

344
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,419
Shut off your phones,
so I can read the house.

345
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,037
- John, are you okay?
- Why?

346
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:48,464
- You're bleeding.
- What?

347
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:49,930
Your nose is bleeding.

348
00:27:52,624 --> 00:27:56,979
- Does that happened to you a lot?
- Uh, no. No, never.

349
00:27:57,004 --> 00:28:01,485
He gets sensitive to change in pressure.
I'd see that happens before when spirits are around.

350
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,707
Congratulations.
Popped your cherry.

351
00:28:05,194 --> 00:28:07,049
It's a good sign.

352
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:15,740
Alright, let's get audio
and video up.

353
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:20,061
Donnie set up the batteries and don't be afraid
to tell people what you need.

354
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:23,273
It doesn't sounds good If things happened,
we don't get it on camera.

355
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:28,841
Why did Sam Chapman think you had
such a connection to the house?

356
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:32,844
So your mother knew Martha and the victims,
but so what. What does that have to do with you?

357
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:34,955
I'm trying to understand that.

358
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:37,989
My mother...

359
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:43,410
She was inside the house,
the night of the murders.

360
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:46,397
You mean Sara Matthews?

361
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,993
The one who escaped.
That was your mother?

362
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:50,952
I didn't tell the crew...

363
00:28:51,662 --> 00:28:53,094
... or Michelle.
But...

364
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,207
Looking back.
I... I should have.

365
00:28:55,232 --> 00:29:00,065
John, hon. This is not going to look good
in a court of law. You know that, right?

366
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,082
All I can do...
is just tell the truth.

367
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:04,658
It's all I can do.

368
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:07,552
And the truth is
you have visions.

369
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:08,915
Yes.

370
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,747
Of my mom in the house.

371
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:17,592
Tell me that I...
I need to let go.

372
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,116
Yo. Here's your walkie.

373
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,375
Thanks.

374
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,358
- This must be the infamous Martha Livingston.
- Yeah.

375
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:34,188
She's kind of hot.

376
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:36,857
- I would do her.
- Me too.

377
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:40,368
You know any of those birds?

378
00:29:40,393 --> 00:29:44,892
It's a grackle. It's an important symbol
to the people of the occult.

379
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:49,885
Said it was used as a messenger in the old world
between the devil and his followers.

380
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,459
Oh shit.

381
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,024
- You got to be careful.
- Don't tell Bryan.

382
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:58,427
I'm going to tell him.

383
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:01,578
- It was an accident.
- I have to tell him.

384
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,234
You leave me no choice.

385
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:12,989
Okay dude. I think this is going to be
the best room for evocation.

386
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:15,465
 It's got like the highest reading.

387
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:21,161
No way.

388
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:24,569
What...
Camera Glasses?

389
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,243
What did I say?

390
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:32,471
- Don't touch anything.
- Chill there, Bryan.

391
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:03,889
Attic's clear.

392
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:32,056
I'm not getting a feed from your camera.

393
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:35,948
Okay, copy that.

394
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,206
Uh... it's almost.
Yeah, that did it.

395
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:53,475
You got it.

396
00:31:56,144 --> 00:32:00,334
I... want to put a baby in you.

397
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:21,834
Anyone here?

398
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,052
My name is Sam Chapman.

399
00:32:56,886 --> 00:33:01,296
We're trapped inside the house.
He's gone... crazy.

400
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:04,404
He's got an axe.

401
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,811
He's gone crazy.
He is killing everyone.

402
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:08,876
I don't know what to do?

403
00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:13,558
I just want to go home.

404
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:14,878
I just want to go home.

405
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:17,130
Aw...!

406
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:29,209
Oh my god...

407
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:31,574
How did you retrieve these files.
How did you do this?

408
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:33,806
The uh..
the frozen hard drives sir.

409
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,004
Okay, get another freezer down here.
I want you to freeze all these hard drives. Now!

410
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,436
- Okay.
- Yes sir.

411
00:33:39,074 --> 00:33:43,493
Just try, if you can.
There must be something else.

412
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:44,973
Dr. Klein.

413
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:47,441
Excuse me for a second, John.

414
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:53,801
- How's it going?
- You are not going to believe this.

415
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:57,332
- Sara Matthews was his mother.
- Who is that?

416
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:01,729
The lone survivor. The one who escaped
before Martha could murder her.

417
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:03,462
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

418
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:06,612
Jesus Christ. The more I learned
about this kid, the less I trust him.

419
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:10,297
Alright. Tell him we going through the footage,
we can't get anything.

420
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:12,453
- Go at him with that. See how he reacts.
- Okay, I will.

421
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:17,217
Also get the guys to look for some interview tapes
from Sara Matthews soon after the murders.

422
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:18,235
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,337
I'm going back in.
I think we're get somewhere.  - (Alright)

424
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:23,062
Hey.
John.

425
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,190
This is strange but um...

426
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:30,893
They can't get any footage 
from inside the house.

427
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:32,975
I don't understand.

428
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,960
You guys came all the way down here
to document a haunted house.

429
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:38,421
And then, there's no documentation.

430
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:40,719
Nothing to show what happened
in that house.

431
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,129
Can you explain that?

432
00:34:42,154 --> 00:34:43,739
I don't know.

433
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:47,037
That's my point.
I can't explain it.

434
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:51,225
I just told you what happened.

435
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,724
Can I just have a little more light?

436
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:57,876
Oh yeah.

437
00:34:57,904 --> 00:35:01,178
Sorry, I don't want to
get the wrong angles on those ghosts.

438
00:35:01,203 --> 00:35:04,484
- Yeah, that's right.
- Very picky. Diva ghost.

439
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,670
Everything we can do
to get them out, alright.

440
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:08,553
Wait a second.

441
00:35:08,578 --> 00:35:11,317
Can you check this camera.
See there might be something...

442
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,773
It's tilting down or something.
I don't know.

443
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:14,700
Oh yeah? Is that one
totally broken?

444
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:16,248
I don't know. There's something wrong.
It just keeps...

445
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:17,260
I don't know what that is.

446
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,466
That's the reason? It's a broken camera?
- I don't want to check it.

447
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:21,804
It's so broken huh.
That what you want me to fix.

448
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,682
You really know what, exactly.

449
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:28,161
- Are you messing with me?
- No, I didn't.

450
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:30,010
That wasn't you?

451
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:31,057
No.

452
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,913
I am surprised this is happening.

453
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:37,287
 Hey Jules.
I think this room might actually be...

454
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:39,729
What the hell was that?

455
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,673
I... don’t.
I don't know.

456
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:47,942
- Something's here.
- Someone is just messing with us.

457
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,467
What happened?
Are you okay?

458
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:54,311
Did you see that door just closed?

459
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:55,488
No.

460
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:59,579
Shit.
I definitely just saw that.

461
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,836
Give me the camera.
Give me the camera.

462
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,034
Come on. You've just
opened the door for us.

463
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:21,752
Why don't you tell us why you're here.

464
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:24,170
Why are you slamming doors?

465
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,876
Show yourself.

466
00:36:25,943 --> 00:36:28,824
Someone just touched me.
Somebody just touched my leg.

467
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:30,900
- Do you see anything in the camera?
- I don't know.

468
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:32,701
- Something just touched me.
- I can't see anything.

469
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:34,683
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

470
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:38,625
Everyone is clean except Bryan Purcell.
Purcell was a stiletto issue.

471
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,282
Got expelled for threatening a
professor during a disagreement

472
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:43,091
Professor filed a restraining order.

473
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:45,751
And Chapman says "he"(male) in the tape,
before he gets killed.

474
00:36:45,776 --> 00:36:49,105
Narrows it down to 2.
He also said...

475
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:54,223
He also said that they were locked in the house.
But how can you be locked from the inside.

476
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:57,537
- We found multiple prints on the doorknob.
- Yeah.

477
00:36:57,852 --> 00:36:58,686
I don't know.

478
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,744
If you're lock inside of a house, Jenkins.
How would you try to escape?

479
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,143
Um...
Try to get out through the window.

480
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:05,319
Boarded.

481
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:07,941
Or. What about a laundry chute
or something like that?

482
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,569
No...

483
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:11,524
Milk chute.

484
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:13,390
What's a milk chute?

485
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,623
Old houses like these have them
so that milkman could leave the bottles.

486
00:37:24,488 --> 00:37:25,692
Oh...

487
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:27,910
Jesus Christ.

488
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:29,521
A little tight to fit through huh.

489
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,982
If only these were the people
we were looking for.

490
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:36,180
I want a picture of this.  And I want a match
on the blood type, right away.

491
00:37:40,497 --> 00:37:42,626
Where is Michelle, John?

492
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:45,057
- Where's Michelle?
-I don't know.

493
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,238
- Mark.
- You don't know?

494
00:37:46,404 --> 00:37:48,045
What's that?

495
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:51,217
- What... I don't know.
- You don't know what that is?

496
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:54,838
I think she escaped through that milk slot
and I think you were chasing her, boy.

497
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:55,977
I don't know what
you're talking about.

498
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:58,413
You don't know what I' talking about or
you can't remember? Which one is it?

499
00:37:58,438 --> 00:38:00,104
- I'm trying to remember.
- You're trying.

500
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:02,992
 Yeah, you try. You know what I thing.
I think you murdered those people.

501
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,424
I think you killed them one by
one just like Martha Livingston.

502
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,745
Only Michelle, she got
away from you didn't she?

503
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:11,368
Just like your mom got away.

504
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:14,049
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

505
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:16,792
I hope Michelle did get away.
I would never do anything to hurt her

506
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:18,764
- Why's that?
- Because she is pregnant.

507
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:20,571
She's pregnant?

508
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:24,225
- She's... she's pregnant.
-  She's 10 weeks pregnant.

509
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,763
We weren't telling anyone.

510
00:38:25,788 --> 00:38:28,256
You weren't tell any.
Why didn't you tell me that, John?

511
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:29,074
I don’t know!

512
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,148
Oh, you don't know. You
don't know anything, do you?

513
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:33,176
You don't know anything.

514
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:38,409
- I think you killed them, John.
- Mark, can you give us a minute. Please.

515
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:40,861
Just give us a second, okay.

516
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:47,879
Hey.

517
00:38:47,904 --> 00:38:50,698
What are you doing?
I was getting somewhere.

518
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,596
You know she was pregnant?

519
00:38:52,627 --> 00:38:57,471
No, but please don't come back until you're invited.
I really was getting somewhere.

520
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,355
So was I.

521
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,902
Okay.

522
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:12,937
Okay listen, that's what he thinks.
That's not what I think.

523
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:16,809
You should have told me was pregnant.
I... I understand why now.

524
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:28,952
This place is so creepy.

525
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:44,908
Did you just turned that on?

526
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:49,534
No, I don't think so.

527
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:52,050
Uh, hey guys.
The master bedroom.

528
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,256
- What's up?
- What happened?

529
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:01,007
I just uh.
I picked up this ballerina and...

530
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:04,307
-Come on man. I told you not to touch anything, right.
- Sorry man, I just thought...

531
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:06,218
Alright. No body asked you to think.
Just don't touch anything.

532
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:07,910
 Bryan. Don't be such an asso.
He didn't know what he is doing.

533
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:14,272
It doesn't matter if it is a couch, a ballerina
or my ex-girlfriend. I don't want you touching things.

534
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:28,647
- Holy shit.
- Everyone, turn your Walkies off.

535
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:31,053
He says over the walkie.

536
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,333
- Any other electricity in here besides us?
- No.

537
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:48,024
- Sam, camera.
- Oh, yeah.

538
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:53,033
This is where it was before John moved it?
- I agree.  - That was it.

539
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:54,218
Yeah.

540
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,589
So I'm just gonna...
put it back.

541
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,877
Come on.

542
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,331
It's like she's resetting.

543
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:18,393
No, she's not resetting.
She... She's pointing.

544
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:20,740
What's she pointing at, John?

545
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:24,534
The wall?

546
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:29,291
The rug.

547
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:32,328
Jules.

548
00:41:47,578 --> 00:41:50,216
Oh.
So much for that.

549
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:55,508
Wait. What if that is not the rug
where she's pointing at?

550
00:41:57,337 --> 00:42:00,153
- Donnie. Help me.
- Let's go.

551
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:13,421
- Oh shit.
- Nobody step in it.

552
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:21,365
- Guys. What is that?
- Donnie, give me your EMF.

553
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:31,214
It's max out.

554
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,615
What is this?

555
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,030
It's some kind of seal.
But I haven't seen one like this before.

556
00:42:36,065 --> 00:42:38,070
What do you mean.
Aren't you suppose to know all that shit?

557
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:42,467
Just that, there are thousands of derivatives of seals.
They all have different meanings and different variations. So...

558
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:45,045
I'm sorry if I'm not familiar with all of them.

559
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,775
We found the source
of the house' energy.

560
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:50,439
This is obviously where they performed their rituals.

561
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:54,068
Which mean.
This is our best spot for communicating.

562
00:42:54,302 --> 00:42:56,710
They may have actually made
contact with the other side.

563
00:42:56,735 --> 00:42:59,511
Yeah, and then Martha went crazy
and killed anyone.

564
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:05,494
The other side didn't make Martha do this, okay.
Because nothing had to make her do this.

565
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:08,852
She was messed up long before
any of this happened.

566
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:10,494
My mom used to always say this.

567
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,098
Growing up, she was constantly
getting into trouble, getting into fights.

568
00:43:14,129 --> 00:43:18,101
Nothing to push her over the edge.
Martha was already way over.

569
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:21,600
Guys.
Is that blood?

570
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:26,502
- No. It's just wax.
- I see. Now the shit is getting good.

571
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:29,384
- You ever seen this seal before, John?
- No.

572
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:34,787
But when the ballerina is pointed at it,
I knew she meant something else.

573
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,693
- Where is it coming from?
-  Hold on, hold on.

574
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:56,439
Donnie,
stay close.

575
00:43:58,156 --> 00:44:00,939
- Shit.
- Michelle, you okay?

576
00:44:01,043 --> 00:44:02,761
She's fine.

577
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,681
Where is it coming from?

578
00:44:06,704 --> 00:44:08,420
Jesus.

579
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,656
I got nothing on here.

580
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:32,129
Careful, careful, careful.
Be careful.

581
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:04,167
- Jesus Christ.
- What was it?

582
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:06,172
- Did you see it, see it?
- What was that?

583
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:07,913
-Did you?
- No!

584
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:10,004
Oh shit.

585
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,312
- What is that?
- What is it?

586
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:18,856
- Check it out.
- Shit.

587
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,819
Holy shit.

588
00:45:33,194 --> 00:45:35,349
Holy shit.

589
00:45:37,479 --> 00:45:42,969
The blood on the milk chute, matches Bryan Purcell's.
It's B+. So he went through.

590
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:46,642
So he goes through the chute 
and he is bloody.

591
00:45:46,673 --> 00:45:50,019
Question is. Did he go through
as a victim or as a killer?

592
00:45:50,044 --> 00:45:53,059
Why would he go through there, if he could
just walked right out the front door?

593
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:57,099
He's chasing someone, Jenkins.
He's chasing someone, maybe the victim.

594
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:59,770
So you think Michelle went through it
and Purcell followed it through?

595
00:45:59,795 --> 00:46:00,850
Yeah.

596
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:03,374
Which means we got to find them 2
before all hell breaks loose.

597
00:46:03,399 --> 00:46:04,759
You go.
Go, go, go.

598
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:07,231
Copy that.
Reeves, what's your 20?

599
00:46:07,256 --> 00:46:12,668
Let's talk about Bryan Purcell.
You two obviously weren't close.

600
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:18,772
I've only met him a few times.
He’s kind of hard to get along with.

601
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,929
So you didn't like him?

602
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:25,684
He was just...
obsessed with this house.

603
00:46:25,709 --> 00:46:30,777
And... he tends on taking things too far.
That's what he did.

604
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:33,971
Come on baby,
where are you?

605
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:41,148
I know you're here.

606
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:47,052
Where are you?

607
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:56,473
Okay.
Have it your way.

608
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,352
Show yourself.

609
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,868
Come on.

610
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:54,891
What's taking so long?
I don't want to be here all night.

611
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,534
Just need another minute.
Got one last thing

612
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:09,495
- Tha's it, right?
- Yeah.

613
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:13,044
What is that?

614
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:15,553
That's an incredibly
sensitive microphone.

615
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:18,561
It picks up sounds and frequency
that you can't normally hear.

616
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:22,997
Records 50 different channels.
It's kind of like a human's inner ear.

617
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,129
How does it work?

618
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:37,893
What is that?

619
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,825
What...?

620
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:55,265
That's cool.

621
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,448
That's us.

622
00:51:03,155 --> 00:51:06,105
Like our.
Our heartbeats?

623
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:10,259
That heartbeat... it's...

624
00:51:11,387 --> 00:51:15,464
It's like a fourth faster heartbeat.

625
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:22,403
That's a fifth one.

626
00:51:22,428 --> 00:51:24,193
Six...

627
00:51:26,392 --> 00:51:28,942
Seven,
maybe more.

628
00:51:37,915 --> 00:51:40,482
- What?
- Someone was just in the room with us.

629
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:43,211
I swear to god.
Someone was standing right there.

630
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,916
- Oh shit! What's happening?
- Donnie, Donnie what've we got?

631
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:52,005
Oh shit.
Shit, shit.

632
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:54,842
There's nothing.

633
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:04,997
John.

634
00:52:07,386 --> 00:52:09,797
What is this?
What the hell just happened?

635
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:11,953
The painting burst into flames out of nowhere.

636
00:52:11,978 --> 00:52:15,480
- What do you mean it burst into flames?
- It just burst into flames.

637
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:19,169
How did you know where the
fire extinguisher was?

638
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:24,083
I don't know.

639
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,122
Have you seen this room before?

640
00:52:32,968 --> 00:52:38,424
Okay, without looking can you ..
can you tell me what's behind you?

641
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:40,222
There's a...

642
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:45,895
There's a tear in...
the wallpaper, and...

643
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:52,159
And underneath it is a drawing of a little girl.

644
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,077
That's weird.

645
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:01,113
What else?

646
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:09,638
There is a photograph of a man in suits and...

647
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:12,845
And seals behind them.

648
00:53:18,391 --> 00:53:20,359
Holy shit.

649
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:22,820
There's something else.

650
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:29,691
There's a woman behind Jules.

651
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:34,289
Jules...!

652
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,226
Jules?

653
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:45,031
Jules. Are you okay.
Jules.

654
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:46,869
- Come on. We got to get her up.
- Alright, we have to leave now.

655
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,614
Do you realize what just happen?
It was crazy.

656
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,919
Oh, you realize it was crazy by her
flying across the room in a shit that far.

657
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:53,837
I'm saying we should think
about this before we jump ship.

658
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:56,237
I want to make sure you realize
what we could be sitting on that...

659
00:53:56,262 --> 00:53:58,839
I realized that you are out of your mind
and we're leaving now.

660
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,925
This is what happens 
when you make a connection.

661
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:03,318
You pussy. This is why we're here.

662
00:54:03,343 --> 00:54:06,359
- No ! Stop it! Stop it!
- Jules knows this.

663
00:54:06,554 --> 00:54:08,347
 Jules.
He doesn't get it, okay.

664
00:54:08,372 --> 00:54:10,538
I'm not leaving.

665
00:54:10,683 --> 00:54:11,965
What? Jules...

666
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:14,862
We get make fun all the time.
People think we're crazy.

667
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:17,751
We get ridiculed.
But this shit is why we're here.

668
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:20,886
What happened was crazy,
but Bryan 's right.

669
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:22,386
I'm not leaving.

670
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:23,918
Fine.

671
00:54:24,082 --> 00:54:28,087
- We are...Sam
- Sam.

672
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,187
Hey!

673
00:54:30,823 --> 00:54:32,562
You okay?

674
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:37,529
- Do you really expect me to believe this joke?
- I can only tell you what happened.

675
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:42,778
- And your friend just flew across the room?
- I wouldn't believe it either before this.

676
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:45,835
I do now.

677
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,157
Hey ! Hey!
What're you going to do huh?

678
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:51,330
You go knocking the doors and:
"Can you help us?

679
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:52,898
We're down the street
breaking into a house.

680
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:55,810
We just really need a lift because
our friends kept the car."

681
00:54:56,062 --> 00:54:58,952
I know your mom was in the house
the night of the murders.

682
00:54:59,919 --> 00:55:01,353
What?

683
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:02,909
Oh, you didn't think 
I would find out about that?

684
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:05,048
What is he talking about?
Your mom was in the house?

685
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,383
I've never told anyone that.
I'm sorry.

686
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:09,702
You know we have talked about
this about a hundred times.

687
00:55:09,742 --> 00:55:12,992
You never mentioned that
your mom was in the house.

688
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,383
I don't understand? 
Why didn't you just tell me.

689
00:55:16,408 --> 00:55:21,384
Something that screwed up...
shapes everything.

690
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:23,832
Who you are.

691
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:26,681
How people see you.
It's not something that you bring up.

692
00:55:26,706 --> 00:55:30,121
It's something you pray people 
don't find out about.

693
00:55:34,474 --> 00:55:35,783
So.

694
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:41,738
- Bryan, how did you find out?
- I do my homework, John.

695
00:55:42,204 --> 00:55:45,950
I had to do a whole lot of searching 
on the internet to find out that the one survivor ...

696
00:55:45,998 --> 00:55:50,349
Sarah Matthews had a son who...
wait for it.

697
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,365
Whose name is John Mitchell.

698
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,982
So my mother was here, the night of the murders.
So what?

699
00:55:56,007 --> 00:55:57,144
Look.

700
00:55:57,169 --> 00:55:59,618
I understand why you wouldn't
want people to know about this.

701
00:55:59,643 --> 00:56:01,331
Alright, I do.

702
00:56:01,356 --> 00:56:06,450
But if it was her who brought you back here?
To communicate.

703
00:56:06,485 --> 00:56:12,362
And if you leave, you just gonna continue
having the same nightmares and visions of your mom.

704
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:17,475
Or you can stay.
Stay to have evocation.

705
00:56:18,372 --> 00:56:21,807
Find out what your mother 
is trying to tell you.

706
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,435
I think she is in this house.

707
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,491
I think you know that.

708
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:33,512
Stay.

709
00:56:38,783 --> 00:56:40,985
Hey, I think I got something here.

710
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:44,423
Wait. Is that a camera
inside the house?

711
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:48,603
- Looks like a bunch of black.
- Just wait.

712
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,112
- Detective Lewis?
- Yup.

713
00:57:09,147 --> 00:57:14,119
Sir. We just got a report of a stolen vehicle
about a half mile up the road.

714
00:57:14,151 --> 00:57:16,112
2000 red Dodge pickup.

715
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:17,731
Why am I just hearing about it now?

716
00:57:17,756 --> 00:57:20,104
Owner didn't know it was stole
till he got in from work this morning.

717
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:23,380
I want you to put out an APB
on a 2000 red dodge pickup.

718
00:57:23,428 --> 00:57:26,767
Anywhere inside a 300 miles radius.
Do you understand. Now!

719
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:25,555
So tell me what happened during this ritual,
uh... the seance.

720
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:33,737
They recited some passage from one of Jules' books.
That she said was used for communication.

721
00:58:35,147 --> 00:58:39,487
I just wanted some answers to this stuff
so that I can finally get some peace.

722
00:58:41,257 --> 00:58:44,657
Alright. Jules, you want to walk us through?
- Yeah.

723
00:58:48,052 --> 00:58:51,791
Okay. So there are a lot of theories
about how to open these gates.
.

724
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:54,465
The idea is that there are essentially
these energy pockets...

725
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,710
Where the air is thinner between
our world and the underworld.

726
00:58:59,342 --> 00:59:03,791
Trick is finding them.
So everybody join hands.

727
00:59:06,025 --> 00:59:09,663
And we're just going to communicate with the spirits.
We're not summoning.

728
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:12,553
And don't move and don't break the circle.

729
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:16,025
Because if there is a spirit is present,
our sphere of energy would constrain it.

730
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,225
Does everyone understand.

731
00:59:21,537 --> 00:59:23,602
Okay.
Go ahead, Bryan.

732
00:59:28,684 --> 00:59:34,306
If there're any spirits are present.
Show yourself to us.

733
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:40,102
We mean you no harm or disruption.

734
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:43,550
Just indicate your presence.

735
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,454
Indicate your presence to us.

736
00:59:48,312 --> 00:59:52,294
Hear me now,
and indicate your presence

737
01:00:08,403 --> 01:00:11,221
It's working.
Everyone say calm.

738
01:00:16,592 --> 01:00:18,363
What is it?

739
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:25,114
- Just don't move.
- What?

740
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:28,336
- Don't do anything.
- Why not?

741
01:00:28,906 --> 01:00:30,440
Trust me.

742
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:42,167
If there are spirits here.
Just tell us why you are here.

743
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:46,838
- My stomach.
- What is it?

744
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:59,261
- Is this suppose to happens?
- Just hold on and let it run its course.

745
01:00:59,317 --> 01:01:03,624
No, I can't.
I can't. I can't. I can't.

746
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,741
- Whatever happens. Don't break the circle.
- What are you talking about. She's in pain.

747
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,308
Let's go.
She's gonna unleash something.

748
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:13,418
Put it. Put it back.
What do you mean don't know how?

749
01:01:13,443 --> 01:01:16,044
Michelle.
Don't...!

750
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:18,107
Let Go.

751
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:27,595
- Mom?
- Let go, John.

752
01:01:28,306 --> 01:01:30,474
It's time to let go.

753
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:34,764
Let go.
Let go.

754
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:40,022
No!

755
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,674
Get to the car.

756
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:51,801
Let's leave.

757
01:01:52,753 --> 01:01:56,563
- The door.
- What?

758
01:01:56,598 --> 01:01:58,038
And then what?

759
01:01:58,063 --> 01:02:00,422
Get me out of here, John.

760
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:03,986
I've lost her.
Michelle!

761
01:02:04,145 --> 01:02:07,993
I tried to find her, but it was dark.
And...

762
01:02:08,163 --> 01:02:12,267
I can hear people yelling and screaming.

763
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,176
And I just needed to find Michelle.

764
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:19,031
Michelle!

765
01:02:22,761 --> 01:02:24,417
Michelle!

766
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:32,172
Bryan.

767
01:02:34,086 --> 01:02:37,603
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die.

768
01:02:37,643 --> 01:02:42,568
- Bryan, you alright?
- Everyone must die.

769
01:02:43,143 --> 01:02:46,443
Everyone must die.

770
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:50,430
- Bryan?
- Everyone must die.

771
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:58,642
So.
You're saying Bryan became possessed.

772
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:00,175
Is that right?

773
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:18,851
The killer is filming the murders.

774
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:21,309
How is he holding the camera while he's filming that?

775
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:25,398
See those glasses on the table?
We found those where they did the ritual.

776
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:28,054
Forensic, you still in the house?
- We're still here sir.

777
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:31,200
I want to see exactly what those kids were
using during the seance. You understand.

778
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:34,469
- I want it clearly marked and I want it in 15.
- Copy that.

779
01:03:34,595 --> 01:03:37,058
My name is Leonard Abbernacky.

780
01:03:37,762 --> 01:03:42,795
I lived just down the road.
My wife called me, she wanted me to.. check...

781
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go back to Abbernacky footage.

782
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:52,731
I got up to the porch
and there's some kind of noise.

783
01:03:52,756 --> 01:03:54,422
Some distance off it.

784
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,774
- Crash.
- Car crash.

785
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,997
No. The hearing distance can't be
more than a few miles from here.

786
01:03:59,022 --> 01:04:01,024
Meaning. We search every road around here.

787
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:03,218
That the front of the
house or back of the house?

788
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:05,294
That is the front
of the house.

789
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:07,798
He ain't pointing at the road,
he's pointing at Jackson farm.

790
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:09,288
Did you checked Jackson farm?

791
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:11,913
- No sir, it's private property.
- Alright, I want you to get everybody.

792
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,294
I want you to go down to Jackson farm.
I want you look for a red pickup truck.

793
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,761
There are lots roads and lots of swamps.
So get the dogs and spread out.

794
01:04:17,786 --> 01:04:18,780
Jackson, 
Frederick.

795
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:20,387
Go back.
Go back again.

796
01:04:20,412 --> 01:04:24,107
I got up to the porch
and there's some kind of noise.

797
01:04:24,132 --> 01:04:25,994
Some distance off it.

798
01:04:27,355 --> 01:04:29,255
Let's say that I believe you.

799
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,375
That Bryan became
possessed or changed.

800
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,802
That still doesn't
make him a murderer.

801
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:36,388
I know.

802
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,728
So.
What happened next?

803
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:12,347
Bryan Purcell was attacking
you with an axe?

804
01:05:12,372 --> 01:05:16,521
He was wearing these glasses with... 
the tiny camera on them.

805
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,815
Are you telling me
it was Bryan Purcell?

806
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:24,104
Yes, but it... 
it wasn't him.

807
01:05:24,245 --> 01:05:27,418
Are you IDing Bryan Purcell?
That's all I need to know.

808
01:05:27,443 --> 01:05:30,498
I tell you he wasn't human.

809
01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:32,156
I'll be right back.

810
01:05:34,878 --> 01:05:37,506
- That all of it?
- Yeah. This is all in front of the room.

811
01:05:37,531 --> 01:05:39,099
Just in front of it.

812
01:05:39,124 --> 01:05:40,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

813
01:05:40,306 --> 01:05:41,810
He just ID Bryan Purcell.

814
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:44,100
Said he attacked him with an axe 
and then went after everyone else.

815
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,096
- Oh man. And he's sure?
- Yes, he's sure.

816
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:46,470
Alright.

817
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,497
Lewis. You better come down here.
We spotted something.

818
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:50,118
On my way, 
on my way.

819
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:52,552
Do me a favor. See if you
can make anything of this.

820
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:53,642
Why me?

821
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:56,978
Because you're a doctor.
And I was hoping you can read Latin.

822
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:01,842
Can you get me gloves, please?

823
01:06:07,591 --> 01:06:09,647
Bryan Purcell!

824
01:06:12,755 --> 01:06:13,953
Purcell.

825
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,019
Mr. Purcell.
Can you hear us?

826
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:27,088
Can you hear me?
I got a pulse.

827
01:06:27,113 --> 01:06:30,172
We've got a 20i. 
About a mile north of LaForte Road.

828
01:06:30,197 --> 01:06:32,359
Victim is seriously injured.

829
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:35,335
Stay with us buddy. Ambulance's on the way.
You'll be okay.

830
01:06:39,017 --> 01:06:41,248
Hey. 
Do you know what this symbol is?

831
01:06:42,856 --> 01:06:45,106
I believe that is a circle.

832
01:06:48,865 --> 01:06:50,028
What are you doing?

833
01:06:50,053 --> 01:06:52,752
I'm doing research that already 
should have been done.

834
01:06:52,777 --> 01:06:55,792
It is a circle painted on the ground.
Those kids are crazy.

835
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:57,755
I know... those kids are crazy.

836
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,238
But it makes sense to someone. 
And we're trying to get into that someone's head.

837
01:07:01,273 --> 01:07:03,502
Can you get me a computer, please.

838
01:07:09,177 --> 01:07:11,499
Hey, Jenkins!
Hurry!

839
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:14,870
Help!

840
01:07:14,895 --> 01:07:16,384
Reeves!

841
01:07:16,609 --> 01:07:17,927
Here!

842
01:07:18,495 --> 01:07:21,100
Reeves! 
Hold on buddy.

843
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:24,313
Officer down. Suspect is on the foot.
Jesus.

844
01:07:25,766 --> 01:07:29,332
PICTURE PATTERN RECOGNITION

845
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:34,741
Seal of the Left Hand Path.

846
01:07:45,822 --> 01:07:48,032
Holy shit.
Call the... call the cops.

847
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,517
- I can't talk right now.
- Okay, just listen then.

848
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:57,246
That Latin passage you wanted me to read.

849
01:07:57,271 --> 01:07:58,235
It's a seance.

850
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,888
It's a seance to communicate 
with the other side.

851
01:08:00,913 --> 01:08:04,476
It says stuff like:
'Come to us. Make your presence known."

852
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,261
It sounds kind of innocuous, 
but then I digged...

853
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:09,373
- Elizabeth. Elizabeth.
- Wait. The symbol in the living room...

854
01:08:09,398 --> 01:08:11,551
It's called "The seal of the Left Hand Path."

855
01:08:11,576 --> 01:08:15,353
And it refers to certain places 
as prisons that hold demons.

856
01:08:15,378 --> 01:08:18,094
- Oh, man. This is crazy.
- Hey listen.

857
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:21,428
This isn't what I think.
This is what the research says.

858
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:24,121
In order for a demon to be
released from a prison,

859
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:26,476
everyone involved in the
seance has to die.

860
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:29,119
And then it can leave 
through a pure human soul.

861
01:08:29,152 --> 01:08:32,180
Alright. Tell me how this helps me?
How does this help me?

862
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:34,503
We're trying to get
inside Bryan's head.

863
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:38,838
And if Bryan thinks everyone has to die 
for a demon to be released from the house.

864
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:43,539
Then he's trying to kill everyone.
He's delusional and he's trying to kill everyone.

865
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,367
All available units, we have a possible 
robbery in progress...

866
01:09:00,047 --> 01:09:01,601
We need to re-establish contact.

867
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:03,434
I'm sorry that this is happening.
I shouldn't have left Reeves alone.

868
01:09:03,459 --> 01:09:07,612
Listen to me. Re-establish communication.
Let them know Purcell is inside. You understand.

869
01:09:07,637 --> 01:09:10,743
Then get back to the crash site.
We need to find Michelle Chapman.

870
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:16,310
Bryan Purcell.
My name is Detective Lewis.

871
01:09:16,335 --> 01:09:19,173
And this doesn't need to go any further.
You understand me?

872
01:09:19,256 --> 01:09:20,709
Bryan.

873
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:23,661
You still have time to explain yourself.

874
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:29,676
I want you to get your men ready. 
In case this doesn't work.  You understand me?

875
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:31,053
Yes sir.

876
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:32,904
Help!

877
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,832
- They found Bryan Purcell.
- What about Michelle?

878
01:09:38,857 --> 01:09:42,283
- No, no Michelle yet.
- He knows where she is.

879
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:45,388
- You got to get her from him now.
- They will.

880
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:48,351
I'm going to have one of my men 
sent in walkie.

881
01:09:48,376 --> 01:09:52,680
They're going to come up to the door 
and they're going to slide a walkie.

882
01:09:53,404 --> 01:09:55,000
Here it comes.

883
01:09:57,186 --> 01:09:59,498
Pick that up, Bryan.

884
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:04,531
Pick it up, Bryan.

885
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:11,556
Do this anyway you want to.
But you have to talk to me, Bryan.

886
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:12,972
What the hell is Bryan doing?

887
01:10:12,997 --> 01:10:15,916
- He's stone walling.
- Wh... Michelle could be bleeding to death.

888
01:10:15,941 --> 01:10:18,754
John relax.
We're handling it, okay.

889
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,726
- Tell us where she is at!
- John, stop!

890
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,445
- Say something, Bryan!
- Stop!

891
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,889
- (Stop!)
- (Say something!)

892
01:10:24,914 --> 01:10:27,602
God Damn it, Klein. 
You get him off that walkie.

893
01:10:27,982 --> 01:10:31,018
Tell us where she is!
Tell us where she is!

894
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:32,936
Bryan.

895
01:10:33,492 --> 01:10:35,085
Say something!

896
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,054
- ...thing inside of you.  I'm just...
-  John!

897
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:38,385
Speak!

898
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:44,963
Medic!

899
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:49,213
- What happening?
- He's having seizures.

900
01:10:49,775 --> 01:10:51,025
John.

901
01:10:52,726 --> 01:10:53,918
What?

902
01:10:54,246 --> 01:10:56,817
Alright, talk to me.
What've you got.

903
01:11:02,951 --> 01:11:04,109
Bryan.

904
01:11:04,452 --> 01:11:07,198
Mark... 
Mark, you need to stop Bryan.

905
01:11:10,556 --> 01:11:14,055
He's going into a cardiac arrest!
We need to get these cuffs off of him!

906
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:16,521
Bryan is trying to kill John.

907
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:18,610
Mark, do something!

908
01:11:22,299 --> 01:11:24,399
Do something!

909
01:11:43,474 --> 01:11:45,121
Check the clerk.

910
01:11:46,304 --> 01:11:48,939
Bryan.
Look at me son.

911
01:11:49,107 --> 01:11:50,884
Where is Michelle.

912
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:53,090
Tell me where Michelle is.
Is she alive?

913
01:11:53,115 --> 01:11:54,145
Is Michelle alive?

914
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:56,895
Heh, heh, heh...

915
01:11:57,636 --> 01:12:00,596
What'd you do? 
Is she with God?

916
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:02,564
Is she with God?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

917
01:12:02,589 --> 01:12:05,454
Tell me if Michelle is alive.
Shake your head.

918
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:07,331
Bryan!
Bryan!

919
01:12:07,473 --> 01:12:08,889
Bryan!

920
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:14,190
Son of a bitch.

921
01:12:15,312 --> 01:12:18,849
You might want to look at this.
The reason he couldn't talk.

922
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:21,271
He's missing his tongue.

923
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:23,239
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

924
01:12:27,787 --> 01:12:30,048
- What the hell happened back there?
- I don't know.

925
01:12:30,073 --> 01:12:32,607
But when Bryan started to go crazy.
John just lost it. And then.

926
01:12:32,651 --> 01:12:34,904
I don't know how to say this.
But that guy just flew across the room.

927
01:12:34,929 --> 01:12:37,833
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not kidding. He flew across the room.

928
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:38,529
Jesus Christ.

929
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:42,745
- Hey. You got to listen to me.
- I can't, I can't. I think Bryan told us where Michelle is.

930
01:12:43,324 --> 01:12:45,762
- Klein, you read?
- Go for Klein.

931
01:12:45,787 --> 01:12:48,626
Do you still want to see that 
Sara Matthews footage?

932
01:13:17,637 --> 01:13:19,795
You son of a bitch.

933
01:13:25,142 --> 01:13:26,308
Michelle.

934
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:29,047
Jenkins, get a medic.
We got her.

935
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:30,022
Damn it.

936
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:33,659
Hey. 
You're okay. You're okay.

937
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:36,083
Alright.

938
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:40,126
You're alright, 
you're alright, you're alright.

939
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:42,673
Okay. Okay.
You're doing okay.

940
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:43,900
Medic! 
Get a medic.

941
01:13:43,925 --> 01:13:46,133
Jenkins, I need help.
Get people up here.

942
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:49,996
What've you got?

943
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,980
Sara Matthews. 
John's mother.

944
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:57,560
Something happened with Martha
during the seance.

945
01:13:57,613 --> 01:14:01,675
And then after. 
She wasn't herself.

946
01:14:01,793 --> 01:14:06,341
She just kept... 
saying that everyone had to die.

947
01:14:07,752 --> 01:14:10,463
Everyone had to die 
so she could be free.

948
01:14:10,493 --> 01:14:12,145
Now look at this.

949
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:21,842
She's pregnant.
Baby okay?

950
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:24,225
Too early to tell.
We have to get her to the unit.

951
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,206
- Wait, wait, wait...
- He's killed them.

952
01:14:27,231 --> 01:14:29,924
- What're you saying now?
- Same room.

953
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:31,442
What room?

954
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:32,918
- Same room.
- Same room.

955
01:14:32,952 --> 01:14:34,673
We have to get her to the ambulance.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

956
01:14:34,698 --> 01:14:35,955
Let's go.

957
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,426
Officer. 
Can you re-cuff the suspect, please.

958
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:45,401
What?

959
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:02,177
- Stay close, I just need a minute alone with him.
- Sure thing.

960
01:15:03,728 --> 01:15:09,117
I heard them. Michelle alive.
She's going to make it, right?

961
01:15:09,554 --> 01:15:12,098
I don't know John.
Do you want her to make it?

962
01:15:12,793 --> 01:15:14,877
I like that very much.

963
01:15:15,799 --> 01:15:18,443
It was you. 
It wasn't Bryan.

964
01:15:18,538 --> 01:15:22,217
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.
For me to live.

965
01:15:22,242 --> 01:15:24,873
You manipulated
this whole night.

966
01:15:24,965 --> 01:15:27,461
But it didn't work.
Because everyone didn't die.

967
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:29,434
Michelle is still alive.

968
01:15:29,594 --> 01:15:34,272
So, is there anything you want to tell me 
before you go to prison for the rest of your life.

969
01:15:34,728 --> 01:15:37,229
I'm not going to prison,
Elizabeth.

970
01:15:39,194 --> 01:15:40,803
I'm leaving it.

971
01:15:40,926 --> 01:15:44,017
Okay.
Maybe you didn't hear me.

972
01:15:44,052 --> 01:15:45,509
But, everybody didn't die.

973
01:15:45,534 --> 01:15:48,286
Your little ritual didn't work
because Michelle is still alive.

974
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,982
- And you're still alive.
- You're wrong.

975
01:15:53,664 --> 01:15:55,928
Jesus Christ.

976
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:03,850
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.
Everyone must die for me to live.

977
01:16:03,956 --> 01:16:08,003
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.

978
01:16:11,813 --> 01:16:14,042
Everyone must die.

979
01:16:14,764 --> 01:16:19,735
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die for me to live.

980
01:16:52,022 --> 01:16:53,262
Klein.

981
01:16:53,287 --> 01:16:55,741
The ritual is working.

982
01:17:02,104 --> 01:17:04,005
Open the door.

983
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,123
Open the god damn door!
Move!

984
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:19,117
John's mother was my vessel,
but she escaped.

985
01:17:19,152 --> 01:17:22,279
Now Michelle is my vessel.

986
01:17:22,653 --> 01:17:27,156
And once she crosses the seal,
I'll be free.

987
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:39,645
Elizabeth!

988
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:43,016
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.

989
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:46,149
That's okay. Alright. Alright.
You're okay. You're okay.

990
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:47,880
He's gone. 
He's gone.

991
01:17:47,905 --> 01:17:50,907
He disappeared. He disappeared.
It was him. It was John.

992
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,487
He killed all of them.

993
01:17:52,512 --> 01:17:54,956
And I know you're not going to believe me.
He became possessed.

994
01:17:54,981 --> 01:17:59,034
He's dead. He's in the house. 
So I know he's dead. He's hung himself.

995
01:17:59,069 --> 01:18:00,924
- He's in the house and he's hung himself.
- No, no, no...

996
01:18:00,949 --> 01:18:02,694
- He's dead and I'm telling you I just saw it.
- No, no, no...

997
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,528
I just saw it.

998
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,505
He was just sitting there...

999
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,861
and I started choking.

1000
01:18:09,971 --> 01:18:11,477
Look! 
Look at it!

1001
01:18:11,502 --> 01:18:13,422
Look at this.
Look.

1002
01:18:13,725 --> 01:18:16,665
See.
See.

1003
01:18:18,685 --> 01:18:20,145
I don't understand.

1004
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:23,260
You guys came all the way down here
to document a haunted house...

1005
01:18:23,285 --> 01:18:28,431
And then there's no documentation. 
Nothing to show what happened in that house.

1006
01:18:28,456 --> 01:18:30,280
Can you explain that?

1007
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,621
How do you explain that?

1008
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:34,288
I can't.

1009
01:18:34,613 --> 01:18:36,152
I can't

1010
01:18:48,012 --> 01:18:49,721
I just...

1011
01:18:49,947 --> 01:18:51,706
I just felt it kick.

1012
01:18:51,731 --> 01:18:53,588
Is this the first one.

1013
01:18:56,973 --> 01:19:00,458
Just gonna get a quick listen
 to your baby, alright.

1014
01:19:12,611 --> 01:19:14,117
Okay.

1015
01:19:14,942 --> 01:19:19,032
You don't have anything to worry about.
Your baby is going to be just fine.

1016
