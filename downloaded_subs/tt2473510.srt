There is a string of lights in that box.

104
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,270
This box?

105
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,670
This is only sealant

106
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,410
What?
Sealant.

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,880

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,730

114
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,790
Ladies and gentlemen.

115
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,160
The award-winning cameraman.

116
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,100
From outer space.

117
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,230
Pope.

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,270
Where did you get that? It is giant.
It's so big.

119
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,740
It is very large.

121
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,880

But this is old...

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,760
There are traces in the lights and
I see a kind of...

127
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,360
Strangely in the middle of the room like a blur
.

128
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,800
I think is out of focus.

129
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,700
This is so great.

130
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,940
What?
It is so extrarïo

131
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,540
I'm seeing something in the other room.

132
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,440
Probably only this old.

133
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,580
It is strange.

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,150
Is so strange.

135
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,890
It seemed to be under water when from here.

136
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,170
What are receiving this camera?

137
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,700

138
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
Mike is going to go crazy with this.

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay affection

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,150
Okay, marl...

First the closet. I'm going here.

142
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,230
The closet seems fine.

143
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,660
Under the bed.

144
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,300
I do not see anything except you.

145
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,330
I see a television.
I do not see a TV

146
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,500
There is no TV in your room. Lila.

147
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,940
You mean in the shop
pink bell?

148
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,240
Everything is ready here. One last thing.

149
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,180
You can stop this.
But that heavy is this.

150
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,810
Sleep well. Sweet Dreams.

151
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,510

152
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,720

extras that go to sleep gifts.

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,150
Good night, baby. I love you.

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,450
Marna  Good night.

156
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,930
Ryan.

157
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,690
You coming to bed?

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,130
Now I can not see that thing
. I think he's gone.

159
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,270
Well, great. The fixed it.
Come to bed. Leave that to Matiana.

160
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,130
No. Do not fix anything.

161
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,040
We went upstairs. I came back.
And now it has completely gone.

162
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,640
If you come to bed now
your wife is going to have sex with you.

163
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,380
Sex?
Also.

164
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,010
... I... I'll have sex with you.

165
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,220
Anti That was sexy.

166
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,050
Okay. I'm going there.

167
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,360
This thing is absolutely spectacular.

168
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,690
Looks pretty spectacular.
I know.

169
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,330
The thing is... you found anything?

170
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,630
Is completely original.

171
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,770
I've been like 15 websites.
And nothing looks like this camera.

172
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,140
This usually has 3  photo tubes.

173
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,270
This has 6.
Oh, God mi'o.

174
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,480
It seems to have as a multiple range
approach.

175
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,310
I see arrows to focus.

176
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,350
But this here
Ol.

177
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,010
I have no idea what it does.

178
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,950
By
much you like this? It's just a camera.

179
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,020
I do not know. I was in my house.
I have never seen any of this.

180
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,620
This case... I have never before seen. Mike.

181
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,160
This type ...

182
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,970
Definitely...

183
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,370
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

184
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,570
It is the same thing?
Who were you talking about?

185
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,140
My friend.
Your friend?

186
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,850
Where is your friend?

187
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,550
Pope. I play the hidden
. Count to ten.

188
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,290
Count to ten.
It's okay.

189
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,230
One.

190
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,130
Two.

191
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,730
Très .

192
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,870
Where did he go?

193
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,300
Well, the girls came out this
night. We have the house to ourselves.

194
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,740
Why do not you take the night off?

195
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,770
I have to finish this game
before Christmas Day. friend.

196
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,540
Was checking my bursa.
Yes? What did you find? Your underwear?

197
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,280
I have a little souvenir of my trip to Belgium.

198
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,210
Good Belgian chocolate ..

199
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,280
Wrapped in foil?

200
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,720
Believe me. Does not look much...
You've been in your pocket for weeks.

201
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,850
It's not about the presentation.
They put a lot of time in the chocolate.

202
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,560
Ryan. for real?
I expect it is because of me.

203
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,730
And I appreciate it.
You know very well.

204
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,090
I've been living with you for long.

205
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,430
Fair enough. I swear to God.

206
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,930
You can eat.

207
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,310
You're talking about.

208
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,280
Santa is the best.

209
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,510
He has a festive attitude.

210
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,480
Simply
work one night and fly with his sleigh.

211
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,550
With magical deer. Sign me.

212
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,390
I want to be like Santa.

213
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,830
Why still have a VHS...
I ever tell you

214
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,790
Old pornography steal potatoes?

215
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,960
And needed a way to see this, so...

216
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,970
Oh, he had so many European rare.

217
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,270
It is where the guy
eggs tied with leather.

218
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,940
All are from 88 to 92?
I do not know.

219
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
Let's see what we have here.
Yes.

220
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,950
Lie back.

221
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,350
It's not your house, man. Where is that?
I do not know.

222
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,020
88
88.

223
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,860
There he is.
Oh my goodness. This will be so sexy.

224
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,090
Why are we seeing? Oh, God rrrio.

225
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,130
Shoulders. I am a kind of shrugged.

226
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
Oh, no.

227
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Here is where it gets really good.

228
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,170
No Mores.

229
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,380
Back to where was your Marna.

230
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,310
Goodbye.

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,210
What horror

232
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,650
Tell me when you return  women.

233
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
I'll put another tape.

234
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,550
Find someone with small shoulders.

235
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,120
Cbmo go play?

236
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,820
Who is winning?

237
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,290
Why are not you talking about?

238
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,490
I'm one of you.

239
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,800
I think this...

240
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,530
It's wild, man.

241
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,940
If?

242
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
Now I put another tape.
Let's see those shoulders.

243
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,510
Are you sure you're ready for this?

244
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,080
Oh, my God. This is perfect.

245
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,920
's An earthquake.
Oh shit.

246
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,180
's An earthquake.

247
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,650
No. No. No.
's an earthquake.

248
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,450
What is this?

249
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,260
How about a inside?

250
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,930
They filmed everything?
This could be a porno.

251
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,060
Okay.
Think of it.

252
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,130
Well, Christi. Do not use your eyes to see.

253
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,500
Use what is within you.
This is something different.

254
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm doing, mesmerizing?

255
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,740
Focus Christi.

256
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,180
I need you to concentrate.
Concentrate on that, Christi?

257
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,580
Your time  through it, Christi.
Let me show you what he sees.

258
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,880
What the hell...

259
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,480
Let it take you there.

260
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,050
Let me show you.

261
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,820
I hate this family.
One room.

262
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,730
This girl is taking minutes?

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,770
Many colors.

264
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,200
I also see colors, man.

265
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,770
Butterflies.

266
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,640
There is a large bird in the door.

267
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,280
Why are you laughing?

268
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,880
There is a tent.

269
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
A tent?
Than?

270
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,690
Ryan?
As where we camped.

271
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,030
Entered the room of the girl.

272
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,900
Why are you looking like this?

273
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,070
Think I missed?

274
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,370
A teddy bear half the
room. Butterflies. A bird on the wall.

275
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,680
You sound familiar?

276
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,680
Bored?
She described Lila's room, Mike.

277
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,680
No brother, what happens? Are you high.
Mike. is describing

278
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,820
Lila's room.
Corniste more chocolate than me?

279
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,690
Is there, Christi?

280
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,720
Ryan. please. and turn it off.

281
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,790
It's in the room?

282
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,030
Is in the house?

283
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,170
Can you see it?

284
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,400
Why do the forces? Who is EP

285
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,780
Is there.

286
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,910
You stepped on something.
Are u serious?

287
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,550
No, do not disconnect anything.
What was that, a fuse?

288
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,150
By using that old cassette player?
The electricity returned.

289
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,390
How odd.

290
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,230
You hear that?
Yes.

291
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,590
Come With Me or .
Bring your camera. Go see your own.

292
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,060
According .

293
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,900
Focus. I want you to concentrate, Ryan.

294
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,440
Shut up.

295
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,100
I'm imitating video.

296
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,870
Wait, that's the same thing the other night?

297
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,780
Where did he go?

298
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,830
Mike.

299
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,040
Mike.

300
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,470
Mike, it's not funny. Are you?

301
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,360
Shit.

302
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,900
Mike? Mike, are you?

303
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,110
Mike?
It scared me a lot, Mike.

304
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,350
Ryan  think...

305
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,680
This is rare.
I think my camera begins to see.

306
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,950
I think I'm seeing something

307
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,990
It is a.

308
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,120
A jerk.

309
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,290
You saw the jerk?

310
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,590
There participate of imbecility in your aura, no?

311
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,400
This  around you. You're a jerk.

312
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,300
There they are.
Hello.

313
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,370
Hello love.
Like that?

314
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,710
Estan?
Is Uncle Mike.

315
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,540
That's not good.

316
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,040
Wait.
Mike looks like a huge pile of...

317
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,510
I do not look like me at all.

318
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,950
And that's what you do for a living?

319
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,480
It is similar to Feng Shui.
Is moving furniture.

320
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,650
So that no energy is blocked.

321
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,190
Should do with your home.

322
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,030
Hey.
Why?

323
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,690
Feel different
Your energy is blocked Mike?

324
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,900
I flow smoothly.

325
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,330
If you want to release my energy.

326
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,640
I... no longer what we mean.

327
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,740
Tell them... Tell them
night we had.

328
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,910
Was just...

329
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,950
We saw and heard strange things.

330
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,720
I heard about photographing spirits.
But I have not seen one in person.

331
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,160
What do you see?

332
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,600
Only  forms.
Could be a spirit. I suppose.

333
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,330
Usually these cameras do not see spirits.

334
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,800
Rather other pianos of existence.

335
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,170
Places where energy would travel displaced.

336
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,380
But it also might not function.

337
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,140
I do not know, it's weird.
But I do not think it's a failure.

338
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,780
I saw Lila's room and then

339
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,620
He was in the hallway.

340
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,690
Hey. Lila is asleep. And let us go.

341
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,590
Back at 11. Good night.

342
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,390
Hey, watch the camera.

343
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,090
Seriously.
Relax Ryan

344
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,760
I just want to see what it does.

345
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,260
You do not seriously think or see ghosts?

346
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,230
Si. I think it's very possible.

347
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,700
What?

348
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,210
The lights look beautiful with this.

349
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,480
You should try them with fungi.
Yes, I need wine.

350
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,610
Sure.

351
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,880
Red, white, Cabernet?
Pink.

352
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,020
Sauvignon.

353
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,690
Right back.

354
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,810
Hello

355
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,280
Is anyone there?

356
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,220
Hey, you scared me.

357
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,450
Just me. I have the wine.

358
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,820
I think there's something here.
Than?

359
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,390
I think I felt something.

360
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,860
Ah. Yes?
Yes. Look through the camera

361
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,190
But I saw nothing.

362
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,030
They turn themselves off. Wait, I think that has night vision
.

363
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,530
There he is.

364
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,980
It Must have been the wind.

365
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,250
You see something?

366
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,080
No.

367
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,860
Mike. do you see?

368
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,590
I go inside now.

369
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,140
What the hell is that?

370
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,940
Flew out of the pool.
Shut. You'll scare him.

371
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,910
What? I'll scare him?

372
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,710
Let's go.

373
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,180
Give me the camera.

374
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,280
What is this?

375
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,520
Mike  something here.

376
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,100
This is crazy.

377
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,740
Lila.

378
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,910
Hello beautiful. What are you doing here? It's cold.

379
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,950
Come inside.
It's cold. Let's go

380
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,560
What the fuck

381
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,000
The pool was weird, but she was scared
more.

382
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,810
Perhaps we saw something,
but that camera is useless.

383
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,340
We turned the corner.

384
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,610
We turned and was there.

385
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,080
They asked what to here?

386
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,510
It was like in a coma. I do not know if you heard.

387
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
If it is sleepwalking. I do not know what I was doing.

388
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,490
Not sleepwalker. Always sleeps well

389
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,850
Hey look at this.

390
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,490
If?
There is heard here.

391
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,830
This is yours? Hey if

392
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,000
It is my rosary.

393
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,000
How odd
The burying saw these things here?

394
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,070
No. we did not see. But it is possible.

395
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,040
What are you doing?
You know papa has a new toy?

396
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,210
As you've got yours.
Yes.

397
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,320
Turns out my toy...

398
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,090
She saw something very interesting last night.

399
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,860
I think...

400
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,390
I think.

401
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,400
And you do not feel anything?

402
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,870
I do not want to talk about it.

403
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,240
About who love?

404
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,510
What does this button do?

405
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,020
The spiritual photography.

406
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,180
Hello?

407
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,900
Hello.

408
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,340
Hello?

409
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,380
What happens to me? I'm going crazy.

410
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,180
Lila. what are you doing here?

411
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,480
Carino. that's blood?

412
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,820
You have in your hands? You're bleeding?

413
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
What happened?

414
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,230
Daughter, answer me, what happened? You're bleeding?

415
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,420
You're saying?

416
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,750
I do not know.

417
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,790
You hear that?

418
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,600
This talking backwards.
Bloody Mary said.

419
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,170
That which signif'ca?
It's a game. Niiios a game.

420
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,240
What kind? The game originally

421
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,870
You say it three times.
then he appears and tells you who you're going to marry.

422
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,340
But when I played,
as most plays.

423
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,750
You say your name  très times, and a damn
witch appears and takes you by the neck.

424
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,620
As Lila heard of that game?

425
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,050
No way.

426
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,120
I have no idea.
Old were you when you played?

427
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,760
I do not know. Was a girl. Such
once they told her friends.

428
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,430
Come see.
Than?

429
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,790
Look at this. Look.

430
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,500
Come see. Decode the case.

431
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
I look?
This Trente look.

432
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,930
Lived here? It uramente
.

433
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,070
But why you are here? Of 87

434
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,370
It is the same house where they recorded everything.

435
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,940
The place was burned in 92.

436
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,310
No bodies were recovered.

437
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,640
Whole family disappeared, including.

438
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,910
Including their hij as Katy and Christi.

439
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,620
And you think our daughter

440
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,950
Is talking to ghosts.

441
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,020
Elias being awakened in the night
. Playing with something that only she

442
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,460
And the camera can see.

443
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,260
The nirios are.
Not mean they have ghost.

444
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,630
Those who lived here
20 years ago, they put cameras

445
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,300
And they caught all kinds of crazy things.

446
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,670
And our house is built on them.

447
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,240
It's a joke of you and Mike?

448
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,240
No, look at this.
I feel that every time Mike comes

449
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,640
They are crazy to do together.

450
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,580
No. Not so. I swear.

451
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,510
I just want to know if there is something here

452
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,410
Or if I'm going crazy.

453
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm going to feel better.

454
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,980
Well, I do

455
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,750
If? I can do it?
Have permission.

456
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,490
But not for many days.

457
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,860
As Mike. With this will suffice.

458
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,260
You put two cameras?
Is that is the control

459
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,530
To see if it is recording something special.

460
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,900
We have to turn the other here.

461
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,300
Just you gonna see your daughter sleep all night
. Nothing unusual about that.

462
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,210
Oche December 2013

463
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,140
2 dicieabre oche 2013

464
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,700
Okay.

465
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,910
Okay.

466
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,050
Where?

467
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,580
Lila, that doing up?

468
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,050
It is very cold here.

469
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,520
Snuggle right, Lila.

470
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,460
Let me help.

471
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,760
Try to sleep.

472
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,900
What was that?

473
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,110
No problem.

474
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,580
Well, Lila.

475
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,550
Go to bed, good night, okay?

476
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,680
Now he goes to sleep.

477
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,970
Hello my love. I saw something in your room last night
you and Skyler aunt.

478
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,000
Linda?

479
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,870
What woke you last night?

480
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,740
Tobi did.

481
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,310
Tobi did?

482
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,310
Who is Tobi?

483
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,380
Lila, who is Tobi?

484
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,590
Lila?

485
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,590
There was a dark shape that was floating

486
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,930
I call and Tobi.

487
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,200
Not given any fear.

488
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,970
And I know it sounds strange, but I think it's our
ghost.

489
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,140
Emily  believe me crazy. But remember that you
comment

490
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,340
Lila said Tobi awoke last night?

491
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,610
Well look at this.

492
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,340
88. Is the

493
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,310
Do not sit there. Tobi is the place.

494
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,710
Oh. forgiveness. Tobi is sitting now?

495
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,880
Are talking about Tobi. Sorry
Tobi.

496
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Is it a coincidence.
And in 4 years.

497
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,560
The girls grew up a little and we
ponytail.

498
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,160
Here comes.

499
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,270
So they kept contact...
Tobi.

500
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,570
That pretty.
No Mike.

501
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,270
This is before Facebook.
It is hard to keep in touch with people.

502
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,910
Think it's a boy or girl?

503
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,640
Because Tobi would be a great name
stripper.

504
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,280
In our center court.

505
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,350
Strong applause. It is Tobi.

506
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,950
Listen to the bed if it works.

507
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,790
Record things that others do not.
It is crap. You hear?

508
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,490
Addition Tobi is not a common name.

509
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,420
Perhaps she saw the video.
Mike is very pequeha.

510
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,890
You have no idea who is a VHS.

511
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,170
You think was there, shoved and gave
play? Found the cassette think?

512
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,830
You make me feel old.
The children do not know is VHS.

513
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,940
What is that?

514
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,210
You heard?

515
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,940
Really?
Yes. Ryan.

516
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,410
These seeing something?

517
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,050
What is that?
That viewing something?

518
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,680
Ryan.
Than?

519
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,320
I think is...
freezer making ice.

520
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,520
Do not give me...
A Tobi likes the ice?

521
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,090
We should remove it from the freezer.

522
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,460
Perhaps this is why a bad mood.
Is too coincidental.

523
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,900
's What I think.

524
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,500
Mike.
Shut up, everyone is asleep.

525
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,070
That noise came from beyond Ryan.

526
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,370
Well, give me the camera. Give me the camera.

527
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,820
Mike. there is something up. But it's different.

528
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,420
It moves.

529
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,590
Ryan, let's go. You'll wake her.

530
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,600
So I want to see where it went.

531
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,520
Can you see anything?

532
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,690
No. I'm not sensing anything.

533
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,100
God!

534
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,840
Daddy what are you doing?

535
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,870
Pardon my love.

536
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,240
Sorry, sorry. Everything is fine. Quiet.

537
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,580
Back to sleep.

538
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,350
I cry because...
Your strong yelled.

539
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,690
Your you yelled before the face of your daughter
. Also shout. I could not see anything.

540
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,890
You know who shouts Mike?
Why?

541
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,920
Because I saw this with the camera.

542
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,860
It looks more concentrated.
Have more shape. This dark.

543
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,560
And Mike. I felt this thing through me.

544
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,070
I think it's a face.

545
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,900
It's not human but is crazy.

546
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,140
Why we still need two cameras here?

547
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,810
Not just a camera covering the room well.

548
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,280
This
talking to her and telling her to do things.

549
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,580
And not alone in his room.
It is moving around the house.

550
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,980
I just want to know where you are going and wants.

551
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,050
This better.

552
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,330
December 2013

553
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,960
What are you doing? Put that down. Let it go.

554
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,860
What are you doing?

555
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,330
You can not play with matches
or turning on the gas.

556
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,370
What were you thinking?

557
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,260
Ryan. Ryan.

558
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,800
This is my bible. Always up.

559
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,600
I was in the fireplace.

560
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,840
's What I wanted to burn.

561
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,980
The rosary
treatment was also burning in the fireplace.

562
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,320
What kind of game is played with matches?

563
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,550
He said he was playing a game with Julie.

564
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,620
Only use the first one I found.
She sabla you had the book up there, you probably know where this
.
He does not even know it.

565
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,030
She sabla you had the book up there, you probably know where this
.

566
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,560
I do not know. I went to bed, return here.
The angel is then falls.

567
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,430
I do not know, I went to bed and when
And then the angel falls.
Got things had fallen.
I do not know. I went to bed, return here.

568
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:13,870

569
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,970
No, it does not seem like her.
I do not know. There she seems.

570
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,140
It seems to be different.

571
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,240
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.
It seems to be different.

572
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,470
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.

573
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,510
Initially
perhaps not believe it, but Ryan is right.
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.

574
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:22,770
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.

575
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,140
There is something in our house.
There is something in our house.

It's okay? And mom and dad want to talk

587
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,430
And marl and potato
no longer want to talk to him.

588
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,670
Lee promised you'd stop talking. You promise me

So the tapes start at 88.

594
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,050
A lot of things for Christmas
and live with their marl.

595
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,750

6No see anything, just...? No.

598
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,330
Mom and boyfriend
are totally absent in the video.

599
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,870
... They are gone anywhere?
Not appear in any tape.

600
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,840
And it's like this weird cult
deal with these girls now.

601
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,900
And Maman Marna this other woman.
6Qué is that, a milk Baho?

602
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,340
Who are these people? Oh my God.

603
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:37,520
It Is  I had another dream.
And fell on the stairs.

These progressing well.

605
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,760
6Qué all mean?
I do not know. But such is their leader.

606
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,430
It is as if the girls
prepare for something.

607
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,600
The need them.
We approached.

608
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,630
Dicembre 2013

00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,000
I try to see if there is a connection.
6Son that we saw the other night?

612
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,670
No, it's a different night, but does the same
. Literally they do.

613
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,910
Every night, like a ritual.
Not a normal home video.

614
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,040
It's like a training tape.

615
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,550
6TE what this show?
I'm not sure. It is very fuzzy.

616

00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,100
I see... a TV.

620
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,670

00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,920
Expected, play it again.
Look, put it slower.

644
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,360
Lee sneezes and she says "Health".

645
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,960
These people, I think watching us.
And these tapes are from 20 years ago...

646
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,230
But they can see what happens here with us
and Leela.

My God.
What is all this?

650
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,090
I not think they're just random.
I think there's a pattern.

651
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,090
Some are made known to me.
I know I've seen this before.

652
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,630
Emily, these symbols on the wall
are on tape too.

653
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,570
Were in the room the girls. And that there
symbol is used by a coven...

654
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:51,240
Ilamado midwives.
... What are witches?

655
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,700
These midwives egan to the Middle Ages.

656
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,780
Emily, they were in worship the devil.
Also used symbols to open...

657
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,940
Carries them to different places and times.

658
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,510
My God.
I know.

659
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,990
What is that?

660
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:13,960
I do not know.

661
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,070
What is that?

662
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,640
Lee.

663
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,510
There's something different with her.

664
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,590
Lee.
What the hell

665
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,990

672
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,860
What the hell.

673
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,800
What is that?
No, I see nothing.

674
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,850
There is nothing out.

675
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,030
Ivam, get out of here

676
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,740
Hello.

677
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:09,070
Our house has been...

678
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,510

679
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,880
Well I will call again at four.

680
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,020
She's been acting weird
and more and more things have been happening...

681
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,390
We not know what to do.

682
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,730
Ten other.

683
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,340
Have a special baby.
So is.

684
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,770

your room when you were in the corner?

685
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,680

691
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,960
Hello. I'm Emily.

692
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,400
We are so grateful that you came
, thank you very much.

693
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,540
I just hope poderles help.
Yes. I think it can. And we explain.

694
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:51,010
This camera captures
things that none of the other sees. It is crazy.

695
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:55,410
sure nothing unusual happened in a house before?

696
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,220
No.
I view this camera tapes...

697
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,950
Those who are 20 years.
It is as if they too will use the camera...

698
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,260
To see these things too.
Father, see this.

699
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,830
I started small and
thought it was a failure.

700
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,130
It is dark when the camera focuses.

701
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,860
And big, as if it grew more.

702
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,970
Has anyone ever experienced this before
elsewhere?

703
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,210
Nothing like that. Y
found these tapes these...

704
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:25,480
Girls playing Bloody Mary.
The same game Leela played the other night.

705
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,850
6de where he learned that?

706
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,220
They recorded themselves doing all these weird rituals
.

707
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,750
You do it very well.
Toby will be so proud of you.

708
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,060
They believe that this is the Toby
Leela speaks?

709
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,990
Si. We think so.

710
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,160
6Hay addition to some other name Toby? No.

711
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,290
Only No.
Toby.

712
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,300
Why?
Well, sometimes the spirits tend...

713
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,800
Hide their identity.
is your... true nature. And they use another name.

714
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,640
As described and what I know, which is very little
...

715
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:06,980
It seems as if her daughter was harassed by a demon
or demonic presence.

716
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,020
If this is so we should go.
Leave house.

717
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,890
We have to go, right? We have to go.
've Never felt anything like it.

718
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:19,160
Spirits do not haunt houses, but
people. If you leave this house will follow.

719
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,730
Demons feed on fear.
The more attention given.

720
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:26,900
Stronger it becomes.
Larger. If flee

721
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:31,110
We can not ignore what is happening father.
It would be nice if I talk to your daughter?

722
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,510
You think?

723
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,330
A bit shy.

724
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:54,230
That name mean anything to you?
Should not?

725
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:07,210
Here it goes. This is your friend?
As Marna?

726
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:12,720
Let me... do not tell me. let me see.
Griselda.

727
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,790
It Géraldine?
Is Bubba. does not read?

728
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,260
I like that name.

729
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:28,030
I think it's great.
Bubba looks hot. I can bariarlo?

730
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,670
I wet it something?
Let me sprinkle a little.

731
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:41,180
A Bubba likes. This very pleased.
6Puedo put some in your head...

732
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,810
To make you feel cool?
How about that?

733
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:51,560
Much better, <j, no?
Yes. <J, you feel better now?

734
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:05,570
Well, <j, what are you and Bubba tonight?
Do you have a secret to me?

735
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,510
What is caririo?

736
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:24,020
I'm sorry, it is not.
Well, I'm fine. I just want...

737
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,990
Take care of your daughter, right?
All right.

738
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,030
I will return soon. Just stay calm.
Rela that.

739
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,160
Cursed  useless cure.

740
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,170
After what the father said
I went back and researched further.

741
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,900
I found this tape in the camera.
I thought it was blank, but look.

742
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,740
This is your home.
Yes. look at the date.

743
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,670
Three days before we moved.

744
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,210
You hear?
I believe that the leader is speaking.

745
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:51,050
No, perhaps only a contractor or someone
.

746
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,620
6Ves he talks about the house?
It Is all of what he speaks.

747
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,260
No, says entry point.
The fact that we moved to this...

748
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:05,000
Home in specific
all that we saw did not seem coincidental to me.

749
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:10,200
No, no, no Higgens. Hubber.
H-U-B-B.

750
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:14,100
Exactly Hubber. Katie Hubber,
is what I've been trying to tell.

751
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:18,440
That's impossible.
Because I'm watching your card and your number is on your card.

752
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,250
They say you never heard of it.
Never worked for them.

753
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:28,290
6Por we looked at in this neighborhood? And
deal. It seemed too good to be true.

754
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,320
Remember?

755
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,760
Si.
6de where wine? As you meet her?

756
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,060
I Call today to the agency and have no record
who worked there.

757
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,030
No one ever heard from her.
Than?

758
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,230
But that's... that's...

759
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:47,500
What if.
If someone put us here on purpose?

760
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,440
What if the hoever cons iro
to bring us to this house?

761
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,150
Think it's possible?
Where he came from?

762
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,180
Sure you wanna do this?
Ol, dl.

763
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,450
You need sleep  affection.
Just wake me if anything happens, okay?

764
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,560
Well, I will remain alert if something happens.

765
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,000

769
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,570
You hear that?

770
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,940
You heard?
Something knocked the camera in the hallway.

771
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:28,870
Not you hear anything?
Do not.

772
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,320

There's nothing here.

779
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:47,420
I think I heard something.
