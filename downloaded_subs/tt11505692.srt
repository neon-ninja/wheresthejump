1
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,306
Damn,
was that the brakes?

2
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,959
I just
want to be clear

3
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,179
on the last thing I'm hearing
'fore I die.

4
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,659
Imani, I didn't have time
to bring the truck in.

5
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,182
Mm-hmm.

6
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,750
And that's a good thing.
That means we got work.

7
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,404
This job
came up last minute.

8
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,146
No, a good thing is not dying
in a fiery crash.

9
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,365
Not gonna happen, Imani,
so just cool your jets.

10
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,325
Oh, you laughing
at that?

11
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:32,674
Oh,
is the new boy

12
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,719
allowed
to laugh at that, boss?

13
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,938
Oh, boy.

14
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,600
New guy can laugh
at whatever he wants

15
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,689
as long
as he carries his weight

16
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,560
and wears
the company shirt.

17
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,014
So what do we think?

18
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:12,453
I think we're gonna need
a bigger truck.

19
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,934
Work order says
one person's living here.

20
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,849
Let's get to work.

21
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,010
Think this dude's
a priest?

22
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,403
What?

23
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,795
Those are baby angels.

24
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,406
Stupid.

25
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,110
Yes?

26
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,809
Good morning.
Uh, Mr. Mueller?

27
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,594
Call me Vern.

28
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,857
Alright, Vern, um...

29
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,555
We're here
to facilitate your move.

30
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,949
Excellent.

31
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,038
Come in.

32
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,040
Come in, please.

33
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,665
Vern: You would like
to take a look around

34
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:36,406
before you get started?

35
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:39,061
Yeah, um, Imani,
show Carlos the ropes.

36
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,367
Uh, get the boxes,
the bubble wrap,

37
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,629
and the cart
from the truck.

38
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,457
And, Carlos,
get the shirt on, alright?

39
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,981
Got it.

40
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,308
Please, sit.

41
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,875
Can I get you
something to drink?

42
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,923
I'm fine standing,
thank you.

43
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:19,928
You -- You run a tight ship,
Mr. Schillinger.

44
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:22,322
I must say,
I'm -- I'm very impressed

45
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,541
with the way
you the way you, uh --

46
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,718
the -- the way you handle
your employees.

47
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:30,939
Right.

48
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,681
Yeah, I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Mueller.

49
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,423
Can I get you
to sign that for me, please?

50
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,299
Right.

51
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,662
No, you're good.
Relax, Imani.

52
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,490
You're doing just fine.

53
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,974
Imani, mira,man,

54
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:08,411
I'm grateful for you
hooking me up with this job

55
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,978
and everything,
for reals.

56
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,546
I need you to look me
in the eye right now, man.

57
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:15,766
What?

58
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,203
I'm 100% serious
when I tell you

59
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:21,337
that I'm notworking in
no haunted house today.

60
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,557
Stop.

61
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,863
Why are you laughing?
Look at it!

62
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:28,997
Man, just because
the original Crypt Keeper

63
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:30,738
is living here
in Grey Gardens

64
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,174
don't make
this shit haunted.

65
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,786
I get that reference.

66
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,833
No, I'm -- I'm good.

67
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,836
Trying to be a good role model
for my daughter.

68
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:45,274
Good. No drugs in here.
Schillinger ain't about that.

69
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,581
Nothing that's gonna
get you in trouble with
your parole officer.

70
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,409
Hey, speaking of,
you and Schillinger

71
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,412
have a --
an interesting relationship.

72
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
Yeah,
that's my boo.

73
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,114
Man, you know the hustle.

74
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,811
Who else
gonna give ex-cons

75
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,683
a good,
solid job like this?

76
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:05,033
Yeah, you're right.
He's a good guy.

77
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,078
Damn right.
He went to prison,

78
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:09,429
managed to
turn his life around,

79
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,039
and that ain't
no easy thing to do.

80
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,302
Bro, odds are
stacked against us, man.

81
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,086
Yeah.

82
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:17,915
History repeats itself,
lest we stop it from doing so.

83
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,223
Kind of like his motto
or whatever.

84
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,703
Yeah, that's deep.
Yeah.

85
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,313
I like that.
I like that.

86
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:26,271
Schill's all about
second chances.

87
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,795
He a second-chance
motherfucker.

88
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,886
'Sides,
work ain't that bad.

89
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:35,106
Damn sure beat be bouncing
at the club -- too many fights.

90
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,586
Not the best move

91
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,762
when fighting's
what I went in there for.

92
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:41,025
Alright, get out of here.
Geez.

93
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,855
Oh, shoot!

94
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,770
How do I get me
a tool belt like that?

95
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,294
Oh, you got to earn this shit,
motherfucker,

96
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:53,473
and you can start
by taking some of them boxes in.

97
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,562
Get, get, get,
get to work.

98
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,825
You've got to earn
this shit, motherfucker.

99
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,609
I'm just gonna take a belt.

100
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:00,871
You got to --
Forget that.

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,931
Thank you.

102
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,107
So, your home is a bit larger
than expected,

103
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,936
but we should have everything
out by midday tomorrow.

104
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:25,505
Well, I'm sorry to say,
but that won't do.

105
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,897
Why is that?

106
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,900
I told the new owner
I would be out by morning.

107
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,728
We'll do our best
to accommodate you,

108
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,469
but I can't make
any promises.

109
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,036
It's a very large home,

110
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,429
and there's only
three of us here.

111
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,214
Let me be
very clear --

112
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:41,521
It is in
your very best interest

113
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,785
to see that the first
and the second floors are packed

114
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,918
and shipped by first light
tomorrow morning.

115
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:52,314
The basement and the attic
are not your concern.

116
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:54,359
I will
handle them myself.

117
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,756
That is
four times your rate.

118
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,932
Uh, that's a bit
unconventional.

119
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:05,719
But we love
four times our rate.

120
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,155
Indeed.

121
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:10,680
You should listen
to your worker.

122
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,164
Well,
this workeris in.

123
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,427
What about you,
Carlos?

124
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:21,256
I think my lady would be happy
with the extra cash,

125
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,214
but it seems like
a lot of rooms

126
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:26,566
and we don't -- we don't know
what's upstairs.

127
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,351
I'm not so sure,
Vern.

128
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,396
Fine.

129
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:35,183
Here is
another thousand dollars.

130
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:39,448
It is imperative
that the move happen tonight.

131
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:42,582
Schill, come on.
Let's do this.

132
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,202
Okay, Mr. Mueller,
you got a deal.

133
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,682
Good.

134
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:58,380
See that these boxes
are on the truck by morning.

135
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,513
They will be.

136
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,733
Hmm,
I-I got no signal.

137
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,648
It's a very old house,

138
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,216
constructed mainly
of stone and brick.

139
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:10,348
Yeah, makes sense,
I guess.

140
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:14,004
You'll get a chance to, uh,
text her on break, Carlos.

141
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,705
All nighter,
huh?

142
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:19,967
Looks like it.

143
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,360
Let's get started
in here.

144
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,884
It's a lot of furniture.

145
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,060
Let's get it covered,
get it onto the truck.

146
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,454
Uh, Vern, you might want
to take a few steps back.

147
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:32,022
Can get a little crazy in here.

148
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
I will be downstairs,
Mr. Schillinger,

149
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,818
if you have any questions,
and, uh, just knock.

150
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,050
He can call me a worker
all he want.

151
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,139
We gettin' paid,
ladies.

152
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,838
We're only getting paid
if we make the deadline.

153
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:09,233
Let's work.Let's get it.

154
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:43,153
Come on. Shit!

155
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,813
Gosh.

156
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,598
Hey, jefe?

157
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,252
What's the protocol

158
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,950
for when a doorway's being
a tight little butthole?

159
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,388
Uh, the protocol's never
say that again, like ever.

160
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,868
Okay, my bad.

161
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,783
Hey, but for reals,
what do we do?

162
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,002
Let's move this back
and out the way.

163
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:12,269
Yeah, door's gonna have to
come off its hinges.

164
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,924
First, we got to close it.

165
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,190
And then let's see.

166
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,976
Need a
flathead screwdriver.

167
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:27,284
Just get that lodged
right up in there, like so,

168
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,939
and, uh, yeah,
that's it.

169
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,636
Think you can
handle that?

170
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,203
Okay.

171
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,423
Bro, that was like two seconds,
man, three tops.

172
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:38,426
Glad you're impressed.

173
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,906
Hey, I feel like
you're kidding,

174
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,646
but I'm for reals.
I-I'm impressed.

175
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:49,480
You just smile at me?
You smile?

176
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,093
He's got teeth.

177
00:13:57,706 --> 00:14:00,535
Alright, we're going two
on this one, Carlos.

178
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,932
Okay.

179
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,499
Think you are strong,
huh?

180
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,675
Uh, alright, let's call it.
Let's make it lunch.

181
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,461
Keep it to 20 minutes.
Still got a lot to do, right?

182
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:25,995
Yeah.

183
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,475
Fuck it.

184
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,787
So what you boys
spending your share on?

185
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,880
It's going to my daughter's
college fund.

186
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,491
Well, alright, Oprah.

187
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:45,928
What?I'm just sayin',

188
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,931
Oprah always
openin' up a school.

189
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,325
I'm for reals.

190
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,066
My daughter is gonna be
the first one in my family

191
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,676
to go to college.

192
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,721
That's pretty decent
of you, Carlos.

193
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,854
I'm just
fucking with you.

194
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,551
You're a good dad.

195
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,727
Just doing my best,
I guess.

196
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,643
What about you,
Schill?

197
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,123
Uh, yeah,
first priority

198
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,690
is getting the brakes fixed
on the truck.

199
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,824
Whatever's left over
will go back into the business.

200
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,872
Alright, let's take
a little time to use the phones,

201
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,309
and then we've got
to get back at it, alright?

202
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,182
Hey, man, come on!Carlos!

203
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,444
Is that
what I think it is?

204
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,143
Yeah, I guess some of
that money

205
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,753
should go towards
laser removal.

206
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:32,322
So you a skinhead?I was.
Not anymore.

207
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:35,325
I needed protection
in jail.

208
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,110
Fuck. Fuck!

209
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,155
Are you for reals?

210
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,070
It was easy
to rally around hate.

211
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,116
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,118
"Rally"'s the right
fucking word.

213
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,076
But I don't practice
or believe in

214
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:48,904
the Brotherhood's
hate anymore.

215
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,776
But you out here
calling it a "brotherhood."

216
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,605
Look, I'll tell you what
I told Imani a long time ago.

217
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:57,304
If you want to leave,
I get it.

218
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:58,566
I'm out.

219
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,437
No, no. 'Los, 'Los.

220
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,613
Look,
I wouldn't be here

221
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,311
if I didn't trust this man
with my life,

222
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,791
and I wouldn't have
brought you in, either.

223
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,408
So why
you still got them?

224
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,062
Honestly,

225
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:19,587
I don't feel like
I deserve to be free of them.

226
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,545
Got to earn clean skin.

227
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:25,419
Yeah.

228
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,814
I ain't got clean skin,
neither.

229
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,431
I sold it at first.

230
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,999
Then I started using.

231
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,572
Then they
took my daughter away.

232
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:53,186
So yeah.

233
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:56,102
I'm saving my money
for her.

234
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,496
Sure, man.

235
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,673
Yo, can I ask you a question --
about your tats?

236
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,588
You got to be 100
with me, though.

237
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,068
Sure.

238
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,941
Why they so shitty?

239
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:15,382
Some skinhead with bad breath
and needle ink did it.

240
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:19,212
Alright, Imani,
how about you?

241
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,474
Care to share?

242
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,824
No, I'm good.

243
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,654
We just had
a raw moment in front of you.

244
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,003
Now's your time.

245
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,440
Cool. No.

246
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
Yeah, no?

247
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,227
I mean,
I'm at peace with my past.

248
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:37,491
Some dudes just deserve
to catch these hands.

249
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,014
I'm zen.

250
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,668
Yo, 100%, you're not.

251
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,973
200% you're not.

252
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,541
Fuck you.

253
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:49,851
Uh, alright,
we've got to get back at it.

254
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,245
We still got a lot
to do.

255
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,295
For my first day,
I'm doing pretty good, huh?

256
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,254
Yeah, you working your ass of.

257
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,212
I know.
I can give you that.

258
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,480
It's almost midnight.

259
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah,
we're making decent time.

260
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,006
Place is huge, bro.

261
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:20,229
Yeah, alright, I'm gonna
get going on the bathroom.

262
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,883
Carlos,
you can go in the library,

263
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:23,319
and, Imani, get to work
on the kids' room, alright?

264
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,016
Kids' room?
Yo,
the kids are 80.

265
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,540
Alright, come on.

266
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,976
I'm gonna do
a quick sweep downstairs.

267
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,238
I'll be right back.

268
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:32,546
Hey, hey,
you need help?

269
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,722
No, it's just
a quick sanity check.

270
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,072
You guys get going.

271
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:29,385
Something I can help you with,
Mr. Schillinger?

272
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,779
Uh, I suppose this is
the off-limits basement.

273
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,347
Yes, that's right.
All handled.

274
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,740
Nothing needed
from you here.

275
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,920
Something else?

276
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,922
No, I was just noticing
the lock.

277
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,968
Ah, yes.

278
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:49,144
The crest --
lock seems pretty old,

279
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,798
safe to say.
Mm, yes.

280
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,282
You recognize it,
uh, the crest?

281
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,849
It looks familiar.
Is it German?

282
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:02,026
Oh, very good.
Yes.

283
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,768
Uh, you have
seen it before?

284
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,467
I'm not sure.

285
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,946
Ah.

286
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:13,255
Well, something about it
must have caught your eye.

287
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:17,912
Maybe I've seen it before
and I just can't place it.

288
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,001
I am impressed.

289
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:24,048
Very few people
would recognize it,

290
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:27,269
an old German lock
like that.

291
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,098
Uh,
are you a collector?

292
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,666
No.
Oh.

293
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,626
Well, then, I wonder
where you have seen it.

294
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,025
Something else?

295
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,374
No.

296
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,420
I'll get back to work.

297
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,596
Very good.

298
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,120
Uh,
do let me know

299
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,557
if you have
any more questions.

300
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:55,906
Must admit,

301
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:59,214
I'm suddenly just
as curious as you are.

302
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,263
This shit is creepy.

303
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,309
Hey, Carlos!

304
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,964
I'm gonna be done
with my room in 30, 45 tops.

305
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:57,533
Imani, it's not always
a competition!

306
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:00,928
But I will
crush that time.

307
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,930
Yeah, we'll see.

308
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,149
Ow.

309
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,580
You ain't in a haunted house,
I promise you.

310
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,323
It's just it's an old man,
fucking just doin' his thing.

311
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,247
Book box.

312
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,988
Whoa, hey.

313
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:03,425
Carlos,
it's just me.

314
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,687
Yo, I'm sorry, boss.

315
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,167
It's -- It's this house.

316
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:08,691
It's Vern. It's --
I'm just jumpy.

317
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:11,564
Yeah, well, I think
there's reason to be jumpy.

318
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,130
Oh.

319
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,394
It's like an actual nightmare
that you just said that.

320
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,221
Something's just setting off
alarm bells,

321
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,093
so just keep your head
in the game for me

322
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,051
and let me know if you see
anything weird.

323
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,967
Jefe,I've seen like a thousand
weird things since I got here.

324
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,360
Alright.

325
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,622
And I'll let you know --
anything weird.

326
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,363
Alright.
I know you've been hustling.

327
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:29,625
Let's see if we can pick up
the pace even more, okay?

328
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,018
I just want
to finish this job

329
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:33,673
and get the fuck
out of here.

330
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:35,588
Roger that.
Okay.

331
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:36,850
Alright. Okay.

332
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,373
And what I was saying

333
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:41,028
is you need to use
a smaller book box, okay?

334
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:44,031
Books are heavy.
Trust me.

335
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,207
You got it,
boss.

336
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:52,605
Fuck that.

337
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:56,043
Small books in a big box,
baby.

338
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,786
And one big book.

339
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:20,633
This thing.

340
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,910
The fuck?

341
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,792
Come on!

342
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,881
This dude
ever heard of a Kindle?

343
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,892
Oh.

344
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:05,460
Why's it in German?

345
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,514
Oh.

346
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,727
Come on, man!

347
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:59,122
Hey, yo, boss, come here, man!

348
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:05,694
Something weird, man.

349
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:09,132
Anything weird, you said,
right?

350
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,178
Yo, boss, hurry up!

351
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:13,397
The fuck,
Carlos?

352
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:16,531
You said
anything weird, right?

353
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,192
Look at that.

354
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:32,286
This dude's
got a ton of this.

355
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,593
It's everywhere,
man.

356
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,779
Aah!

357
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:48,519
The fuck
you grabbing me for?

358
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,000
You know you don't sneak up
on a sister like that.

359
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,828
How do you let your whisper
louder than your yell?

360
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:56,005
Guys,
my gut's not sitting right.

361
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:59,182
I-It's this place,
this client.

362
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,363
Say less.
What you want to do?

363
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:09,628
Maybe we just
call it and leave.

364
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,022
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ooh,
that's fucking with my coin.

365
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:16,373
Look, I get it,
but we all could use the cash.

366
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,507
Alright.

367
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,596
I think if we tackle
this together, we can do it.

368
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,032
We double time it.

369
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:25,252
Are you shitting me?

370
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:27,646
Imani,
Vern's the type of dude

371
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,170
that pushes around a stroller
with a fake baby in it.

372
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,825
He can push
whatever he wants in a stroller.

373
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:35,871
If the money's right,
the deal is real.

374
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,091
Let's just finish this shit up
and get out.

375
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:40,484
Yeah, Carlos, look,
my gut's going haywire, man,

376
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:44,010
but we really don't got reason
to call the cops, right?

377
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,534
I don't know.Think about it.

378
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:49,189
Is this man dangerous,
or is he just strange?

379
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,843
The dude's a freak.

380
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:53,541
Okay, I agree, and look,
it's my job to protect my crew

381
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,369
and I don't
take that lightly.

382
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:58,502
So if you want to go,
you just say so and we're gone.

383
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,679
But I say
we get this job done fast.

384
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,072
Get that money.Man is like 100.

385
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,813
It's three of us.

386
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,860
We'll be alright.Come on.

387
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:13,604
That tuition ain't cheap.

388
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:17,434
Alright.

389
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:20,829
Let's wrap this shit up quick,
alright?

390
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,091
Yeah.

391
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:24,528
Money makes me
do crazy shit.

392
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,446
Cool first day,
by the way.

393
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:35,191
Got a screwdriver?
Yeah.

394
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,949
Fuck!

395
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:58,258
What you find?

396
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,139
Don't!

397
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:12,446
It's just a suitcase.
Shit.

398
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,755
But it's little.Jesus.

399
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,889
Yo, hold up.

400
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,761
You told me
I could call it.

401
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,545
I'm calling it.

402
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:27,417
Let's go.
Don't open it.

403
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:43,738
It's birth certificates.

404
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,261
Twins.

405
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,610
Let me see.

406
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,610
The actual human teeth.

407
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,090
This is not happening.

408
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,049
This is not happening
on my first day!

409
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,007
Some actual World War II shit
right here.

410
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:21,836
See?
This dude could be like 100.

411
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:23,490
Fuck! Fuck!

412
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,841
Come on.
Shh. Be quiet.

413
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:29,235
It's coming from
up there.

414
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:36,764
Old-ass Vern told us to stay
out the fucking attic, remember?

415
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:38,157
Yeah, yeah, she's right.

416
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:39,898
We got to get the fuck
out of here, man.

417
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,291
What do you think
is up there?

418
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,206
Monsters.Monsters.

419
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:49,211
Look around.

420
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,300
It's kids.
Yeah.

421
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,085
We got to call
the cops.

422
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:54,521
Sure as hell do.

423
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,826
Imani, get outside
and make that happen.

424
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,045
Carlos,
you're with me.

425
00:31:57,045 --> 00:32:00,266
Let's do this.

426
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:03,443
We got this.Okay.

427
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:31,906
Shit, it's locked.

428
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,342
Hey, Imani, let me get
your screwdriver.

429
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:34,909
I got it.

430
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:41,350
Yo, Imani,
that was badass.

431
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,309
Come on, baby.

432
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,006
Shit!

433
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,529
This is my exit cue.

434
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,791
I'm gonna outside
and find a cell signal, okay?

435
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,402
Yeah.
Alright.

436
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,752
Well, hey, hold on,
let me get that flashlight.

437
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,498
Alright, Carlos,
you're on watch.

438
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:00,761
You hear anything,
you hide, okay?

439
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,154
Yeah,
I got you.

440
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:29,572
Vern?

441
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:41,296
Oh, geez!

442
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,214
Man, yo, Schill!

443
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:14,982
Schill, Schill,
Schill, Schill!

444
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:17,071
Aah! Schill!

445
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:21,510
Aah! Schill!
Schill, help me, man!

446
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,599
Don't leave me!

447
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,517
Schill!

448
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,519
Jesus!
Oh, my God.

449
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:46,535
Are you okay?

450
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,971
No.

451
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,538
What the hell
is this place?

452
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,149
I don't know.

453
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,933
But you do.

454
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,762
You knew something was way off
right when we started this job.

455
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,024
You know more
than you're telling.

456
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,940
I'd just be guessing.

457
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,725
Okay, go.

458
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:06,164
Holocaust experiments,
the Angel of Death.

459
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,297
What does that
even mean?

460
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:11,560
Josef Mengele.

461
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,083
He was
the Angel of Death.

462
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,607
He was a Nazi doctor
who was performing these --

463
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:16,043
these horrible experiments

464
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,479
on the Jews
in the concentration camps,

465
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,785
genetic stuff.

466
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,179
He was --
He was obsessed with...

467
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,573
Yo, what?

468
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,882
He was obsessed
with twins.

469
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,840
Oh, shit, twins?!

470
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,409
So, what, this dude Vern,
he's a relative or something?

471
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:36,106
Or a copycat, uh,

472
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:38,326
some nutjob continuing
his experiments, I don't know.

473
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,546
Oh, come on.

474
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,558
Who's up there?

475
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,899
Forgive
my general appearance.

476
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:33,207
Everything was packed
for the move.

477
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:35,427
Usually,
I assure you,

478
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:37,951
I am much
more professional.

479
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:40,736
Imani: No, man,
come on, please.

480
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,261
I really did intend
to have you in my home

481
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,480
only as movers,

482
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,918
but then, you did not
obey my instructions.

483
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:52,879
And my -- my instructions
were very, very explicit.

484
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:56,448
And, well,
this became inevitable.

485
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:59,451
Guys, help!

486
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,627
Please, help!

487
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:04,325
No, no, no, no,
the walls are reinforced.

488
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,848
Your friends
cannot hear you.

489
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,676
What the fuck
are you talking about?

490
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,549
Carlos, Schill, help!

491
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:15,510
I was always very fascinated
by the ocular region,

492
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,297
and the procedure
which I will now administer

493
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,822
will harvest
one of your eyes.

494
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:25,520
You sick fuck, no.
No!

495
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,700
No, no, no.

496
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,312
I cannot --
I cannot allow you

497
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,053
and your friends
to leave this house,

498
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:41,536
but instead of this whole thing
being erased,

499
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:45,148
I will put you
to very good use.

500
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,555
Hey, hey, it's okay.

501
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:45,121
We're not
gonna hurt you.

502
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:47,950
It's okay.

503
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,388
We're here
to help you.

504
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,740
Carlos.
No, no, no, no.

505
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,873
We got to help her,
okay?

506
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:01,877
Hey,
what's your name?

507
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,668
Shit.
Carlos, do you have that marker?

508
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,933
Okay, hey, look, here.

509
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,891
Here, here, here, here.

510
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:40,089
Anne.

511
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:42,265
Okay. Hi.

512
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:45,181
I-I'm Albert,
and this is Carlos.

513
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:54,234
Anne, Anne, Anne, is --
is there anybody else here?

514
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,457
Where?

515
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:50,899
Carlos, Schill!

516
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,510
No, no.

517
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:57,079
You will become
part of my work.

518
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,559
What work?

519
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,910
Oh, many cultures
have acknowledged the --

520
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,957
the power of the eye.

521
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:08,656
Yes, and something that is
fascinating to me

522
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:12,486
is a tribe
in Africa --

523
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:16,316
they -- they consume
the eyeball for vitality.

524
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:20,538
But I found that the enzyme
of the optic nerve --

525
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:25,020
it must be injected
rather than ingested

526
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,935
in order
to prolong life.

527
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:28,850
No, no.

528
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:33,159
Mm, decades of trial and error
have taught me

529
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:38,686
that the -- the specimen --
that would be you --

530
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,819
must be alive

531
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:45,998
in order for the optic nerve
to -- to release the enzyme.

532
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:47,956
Where are my friends?

533
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:50,002
Where are my friends?!

534
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:53,527
Oh, they -- they will be here
very soon, I assure you.

535
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:55,007
No!

536
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,357
No, no, no,
man, please, please!

537
00:42:57,357 --> 00:43:00,273
Please, no!

538
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:01,927
No!

539
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,972
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

540
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:05,974
No, man, come on, please.
Please, no.

541
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,628
No!
No, you --

542
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:10,239
No, no, no, no, man,
no, please.

543
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,546
Fuck you!
No, no, no, no, no.

544
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:15,593
Shh, shh.

545
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,335
It is very quick work for me
at this point.

546
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:24,384
Aah!

547
00:43:26,995 --> 00:43:29,041
W-What do you think,
Carlos?

548
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,260
Carlos,
we've got to help them.

549
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,045
Carlos,
look at me.

550
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,787
We need
to get them to the truck.

551
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:38,224
Right.
Okay,
you take this flashlight.

552
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,791
Anne, alright, here.

553
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:41,227
I'm gonna
give you my shirt, okay?

554
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,233
Take this, Anne.

555
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,409
Okay, alright, I got you.
I got you.

556
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:55,023
It's alright,
it's alright.

557
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,025
Just gonna get you
to the truck.

558
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,593
Okay.
Just come with us, okay?

559
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,116
It's okay.

560
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,729
Shit.

561
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:50,078
We need to find
another exit.

562
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:51,340
What about Imani?First things first,

563
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,864
we need to find
an exit route --

564
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:55,040
uh, windows,
a rear door.

565
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,651
Anne?

566
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:58,957
Oh, shit!

567
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:05,485
I see you have met
Anne and Sarah.

568
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:08,880
Mr. Schillinger,
please release my girls.

569
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,490
You piece of shit.

570
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,188
You do this to children?

571
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:15,147
I'm gonna kill you.

572
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:19,325
Ah, well, if that is where
you would like to set

573
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:21,893
the tenor
of this discourse...

574
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:23,285
I will match it.

575
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,686
Carlos, Carlos.
Son of a --

576
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:35,428
I'll kill you!
No, Carlos,
you stay with the girls.

577
00:45:35,428 --> 00:45:37,169
She's not dead,
Mr. Schillinger.

578
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:40,172
No, there is still
another eye to harvest,

579
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:42,652
and I need her alive.

580
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:45,394
She may experience
extreme fear.

581
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:50,748
It's okay.
It's okay, come on.

582
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,141
You must come to my lab
for harvesting.

583
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:55,796
Otherwise,
this is all for nothing.

584
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,363
They need
medical attention.

585
00:45:57,363 --> 00:45:58,886
No,
she needs myattention!

586
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:00,975
No,
these are children!

587
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:03,499
They're not experiments!
They're just like us!

588
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:04,762
Nein!

589
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,286
They are not
just like us!

590
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:20,952
No! Schill!
Schill, come on.

591
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:23,041
Schill,
no, no, no, no, no.

592
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,607
It's alright,
bro.

593
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,522
We just
got to put some --

594
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:28,002
Stop the bleeding,
man.

595
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:29,656
It's alright.
It's alright.

596
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:31,397
Come on, man.
Come on.

597
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,968
No.

598
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:44,236
Anne...

599
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:47,979
I do not think this man
is who you hoped he was.

600
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,868
Hey,
where you going?!

601
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,391
Anne!

602
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:14,005
I knew it.

603
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:16,442
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

604
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:18,966
Concentrate, concentrate.
Breathe slowly.

605
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:20,228
I can't.

606
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:22,665
Can't what,
man?

607
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,450
I knew --

608
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,192
I knew there would be
a reckoning.

609
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:33,459
I can't do this without you,
man, come on!

610
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,722
Shit, come on, man!

611
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,028
Please!

612
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:40,466
Help -- Help --
Help the girls.

613
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:43,861
No, please, no.

614
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,820
Shit.
Come on, Schill!

615
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,692
Come on, man, come on!

616
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:54,697
Oh, shit.

617
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:58,310
Fuck you, freaks!

618
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:19,897
Ah, finally...

619
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,464
you reveal yourself,
Mr. Schillinger.

620
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:25,250
Huh.

621
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:45,270
Hey, Sarah.
Hi, hi.

622
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:48,871
Aah!

623
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:53,050
Go on!

624
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:18,336
You can't get in, can you?

625
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,251
You can't get in, can you?!

626
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:23,558
Ha!

627
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,647
Aah!

628
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:43,394
You have made
a truly terrible choice

629
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:45,657
for your hiding spot.

630
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:49,574
It is the room I use
for my failed experiments.

631
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,079
Zyklon B.

632
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:20,039
It will only be
a few moments,

633
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,433
and it will take effect.

634
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,261
Help!

635
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:36,708
It is a shame
it has to come to this.

636
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,492
I really...

637
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:41,495
would like to have
used all of you in my work.

638
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:58,860
Auf wiedersehen.

639
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:55,080
Aaah!

640
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,838
I died.

641
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:44,493
I know I died.

642
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:50,891
How?

643
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:53,154
I brought you back.

644
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:57,681
You're to help
with her.

645
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:04,775
Why?!

646
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:07,821
I am a doctor
and a scientist.

647
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:09,997
This is
my life's work.

648
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,350
Why didn't you just
let me die?

649
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,787
I deserved to die.

650
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:18,223
"Deserved"?!

651
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,399
No.
No, no, no, no.

652
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:23,837
No, we do not
have to hide anymore.

653
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:27,406
This is our time,
my friend.

654
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:30,191
I know who you are.

655
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:31,453
Yes, I do.

656
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:32,977
You have been hiding,

657
01:00:32,977 --> 01:00:36,023
but now you are amongst
your people here.

658
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,898
I am nothing
like you.

659
01:00:40,898 --> 01:00:44,249
Oh, well,
your -- your tattoo

660
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:46,251
seems to tell
a very different story.

661
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:47,644
It's prison ink!

662
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,646
That's the story!

663
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,038
That's it!

664
01:00:51,038 --> 01:00:52,518
No, no, no, no.

665
01:00:52,518 --> 01:00:55,042
This -- This is not the sign
of a follower.

666
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:58,002
It tells me
you were a leader.

667
01:00:58,002 --> 01:00:59,743
Yes.

668
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,483
I have people
on the inside,

669
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:02,789
mutual friends.

670
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:04,443
What do you think
you know?

671
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:06,053
Oh, Heidelberg.

672
01:01:06,053 --> 01:01:08,490
Cass Vogel,
his brother Friedrich,

673
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,840
Simon Hesse.

674
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,885
Need I go on?

675
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:17,282
No, it is not a coincidence
that you are here.

676
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:21,286
I scouted the right man
for this job.

677
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:25,856
Who are you?

678
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:30,599
Who are you really?

679
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:37,476
I am
Dr. Joseph Mengele.

680
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:41,741
That's not possible.

681
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,798
Absolutely not possible!

682
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:05,591
How?

683
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:07,288
I showed you.

684
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:10,683
The same way that you yourself
have cheated death.

685
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:18,996
It's not possible.

686
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:22,782
It is a serum
I created

687
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:27,178
harvesting
viable subjects.

688
01:02:27,178 --> 01:02:28,962
In this
particular case,

689
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:31,312
it was
your schwarzworker's eyeball.

690
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:33,445
Imani?

691
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:35,664
Schill?

692
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:37,884
This dude's fucking crazy.

693
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:39,973
Imani,
you're alive.

694
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,235
Are you okay?

695
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:43,585
I have one fucking eye,
Schill.

696
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:46,153
Hell, no,
I'm definitely not okay.

697
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:48,416
This is fucked up,
man.

698
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:51,637
Who is this psycho?
Schill?

699
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:55,554
Ah, your friend knows more
than he's letting on.

700
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:56,903
Tell her the truth.

701
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:58,992
Imani,
don't listen to him.

702
01:02:58,992 --> 01:03:01,168
The hell
is he talking about, Schill?

703
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:03,867
Do you know what
this, uh, this tattoo means,

704
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:06,739
the eagle
on his chest,

705
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:09,046
the story it tells
about the man who wears it?

706
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:11,178
Man, yeah,
I know all about that.

707
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:13,137
Prison makes a person
do wild shit to survive.

708
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,921
Nothing new to me.

709
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:18,403
So you believe that this, uh,
this was earned in prison?

710
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:19,708
Shut up!

711
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:21,754
Imani,
you know me.

712
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,756
Don't listen to him.

713
01:03:23,756 --> 01:03:25,802
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

714
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:29,196
Have you ever noticed
how -- how this tattoo is clean?

715
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:31,633
Professional?

716
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:34,898
Not like the others,
not roughshod?

717
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:38,118
Man,
they all look like trash to me.

718
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:41,687
Ah, but this was
long before he went to prison.

719
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,258
What is he talking about,
Schill?

720
01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:49,956
He did not find
the Brotherhood in prison.

721
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:52,524
No,
he was already active.

722
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:55,657
This tattoo means
he was a deputy,

723
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:58,791
not exactly
a low-ranking position.

724
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:04,449
Schill,
I'm dead serious.

725
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:07,234
Why is this man
talking shit about you?

726
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,632
Because it's true.

727
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:17,592
No.

728
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,986
No, no, no, no, no!
It can't be!

729
01:04:19,986 --> 01:04:21,248
Imani --

730
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,468
No,
it can't be right!

731
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:25,252
We were supposed
to be friends, man!

732
01:04:25,252 --> 01:04:27,211
You told me
this was some prison shit!

733
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:29,648
We arefriends.No,
if we were really friends,

734
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:31,258
you wouldn't have lied
to my fucking face!

735
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:33,304
I wasn't lying
to you.

736
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:34,566
Man.

737
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:36,437
Oh!

738
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:39,440
I get it, Schill.

739
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,878
I'm straight.

740
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,705
You feel
with that white guilt,

741
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,969
here comes Imani
to make you feel better.

742
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,448
Fuck out here!

743
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:50,103
I was the only guy
that took a chance on you!

744
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:53,759
An angry Black female ex-con
who's unemployed!

745
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:56,501
Remember that!
Remember where you were!

746
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:59,417
Oh, so you saved me now,
huh?!

747
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:00,722
Is that what
you're telling yourself?

748
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:02,202
Fuck you, Schill!

749
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:05,118
I hope I helped your weak,
white Nazi ass

750
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:07,468
feel better
about yourself.

751
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:08,730
Fuck you.

752
01:05:11,298 --> 01:05:15,389
You should've stayed dead,
motherfucker!

753
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,437
There comes that rage.

754
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:21,918
There's that rage
we all knew was inside of you!

755
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,920
Yeah, you keep talking.
You just keep talking.

756
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,096
I'll fucking kill you myself,
swear to God.

757
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:27,749
Strapped to that table?

758
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:29,621
What are you gonna do?!Just keep talking.

759
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:32,711
Keep talking, that shit, Schill,
and you gon' find out.

760
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:42,416
Fuck.

761
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,897
You were right.
About?

762
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:47,682
I am who I am.

763
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:50,294
This world will never
let me be anything else.

764
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:52,383
I read about you.

765
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,342
I know about
your experiments.

766
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:58,171
I need to know how.

767
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,826
Show me.
Mm.

768
01:06:00,826 --> 01:06:04,003
An appeal
to my vanity.

769
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:07,876
Hitler saw the Jews
as vermin,

770
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:09,487
but the Jews
considered themselves

771
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:11,097
to be chosen.

772
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:13,491
And they were right.

773
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:16,146
Yeah.

774
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:17,712
What?

775
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:23,066
The trauma they have
experienced over the centuries

776
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,981
made them stronger
as a people,

777
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:29,637
and therefore, their -- their
enzymes were much more potent.

778
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:30,943
And Imani?

779
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:33,902
Why use her
for this serum?

780
01:06:33,902 --> 01:06:38,211
Her people, too, have suffered
similar trauma, yes.

781
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:40,605
And they --
they carry the enzyme,

782
01:06:40,605 --> 01:06:45,001
and Imani is,
oh, an exemplary producer.

783
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,567
The girls in the attic.

784
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:48,439
Ooh...

785
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:50,658
The girls.

786
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:52,182
Yeah.

787
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:57,013
Well, the more trauma
they suffer,

788
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,450
the stronger
the enzymes...

789
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:06,370
...the longer I live.

790
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:10,200
The house,
the move...

791
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,985
never was a buyer,
was there?

792
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:15,248
No.

793
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:17,990
Too, uh, too many Jews
have gone missing.

794
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:22,516
And now
I'm being hunted,

795
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:26,651
so I have to
relocate quickly.

796
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:30,655
I was tipped off by a member
of the Brotherhood.

797
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:34,659
We have many well-placed
brothers these days.

798
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:37,879
Don't we,
Mr. Schillinger?

799
01:07:37,879 --> 01:07:41,274
Yeah.

800
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:43,885
I will now harvest
the other eye,

801
01:07:43,885 --> 01:07:47,846
and then I will
terminate her, and, uh...

802
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:49,848
We must move now.

803
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:53,025
I-I need to see
how it's done.

804
01:07:53,025 --> 01:07:54,940
I'm weak.

805
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,551
I'll need your help,
but...

806
01:07:57,551 --> 01:08:00,250
I need to see
how it's done.

807
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:03,079
Hmm. Well...

808
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,298
I suppose, uh...

809
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:09,128
I suppose there is
a certain honor in that.

810
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,741
I heard you.

811
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,919
Watch it.

812
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,879
Imani!

813
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:55,103
Imani, Imani!

814
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:58,672
That's the Angel of Death,
motherfucker!

815
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:10,031
We worked hard
for this.

816
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:25,960
We've got to find Carlos
and the girls.

817
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,788
Okay.

818
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,969
What?

819
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:37,798
No, no!
Imani!

820
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:43,195
Violence --
I abhor violence.

821
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:56,817
Nein!Oh.

822
01:10:56,817 --> 01:11:01,648
No! He was my baby!
I created him!

823
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:07,567
We got to get the hell
out of here.

824
01:11:10,788 --> 01:11:13,660
What's that?

825
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:43,647
No, no, no. No.

826
01:11:43,647 --> 01:11:45,475
Shit.

827
01:11:45,475 --> 01:11:47,128
No, no, no.

828
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:49,348
Fuck!

829
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:07,192
Anne!

830
01:12:16,723 --> 01:12:19,073
Can't do shit with
broken legs, can you?

831
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:21,511
Imani!

832
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:23,643
Fuck you,
Nazi piece of shit!

833
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:31,129
We will never die.

834
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:36,264
Help, help!
Help us, please!

835
01:12:36,264 --> 01:12:39,398
Help!

836
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:16,392
You idiot, you.

837
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,483
You stupid, stupid,
stubborn man.

838
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,277
Fine.

839
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:36,412
Do it,
but you cannot kill all of us.

840
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,936
No, we --
we are too strong now.

841
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:50,208
You are one of us.

842
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,992
No.

843
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:54,604
No, I'm not.

844
01:13:57,476 --> 01:14:00,827
The proof
of your belief

845
01:14:00,827 --> 01:14:04,918
is -- is etched
into your skin!

846
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:06,964
It's your blood.

847
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:45,045
Aaah!

848
01:15:10,854 --> 01:15:13,857
You...

849
01:15:13,857 --> 01:15:16,294
You think you can kill
our legacy,

850
01:15:16,294 --> 01:15:18,470
just carve it out?!

851
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:20,994
No, no, no, you cannot.

852
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:24,258
It is too big for you
to just -- just cut away.

853
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:26,347
You -- You think
you can kill

854
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:28,262
what has risen
over the decades?

855
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:33,006
You think you can kill
our legacy?!

856
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,763
Well, come the fuck on!

857
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:35,068
Come on!

858
01:19:57,836 --> 01:20:01,187
So you, uh, stabbed me
in the chest with that needle.

859
01:20:01,187 --> 01:20:02,623
For what?

860
01:20:02,623 --> 01:20:04,669
So we can live to fight
another day, my friend.

861
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:05,975
I told you --

862
01:20:05,975 --> 01:20:08,238
Schill's a second-chance
motherfucker.

863
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:10,936
Straight up,
Imani.

864
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:13,373
Hey, come to think of it,
both you motherfuckers

865
01:20:13,373 --> 01:20:14,984
owe me and my eyeball
your lives.

866
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:16,812
You're welcome.

867
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,639
Thank you,
Imani.
