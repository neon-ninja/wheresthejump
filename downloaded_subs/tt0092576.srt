1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,960
(aka Deliria, aka Bloody Bird)

2
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,914
Hey, baby, got the time?

3
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:32,748
Ah, go to hell.

4
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:08,942
Hey, what was that?

5
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:10,156
What happened?

6
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:11,532
I heard a scream!

7
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,914
The killer!  He's struck again!

8
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:17,554
Another victim of the killer!

9
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,738
Stop!

10
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:25,348
You don't seem to have
understood what I meant.

11
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:27,788
A whore.  You're supposed
to be a whore.

12
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,668
Is it too much to ask?

13
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:34,728
- But Peter, I --
- Sex.  S-E-X.

14
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,508
You know what that is?

15
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,795
Frankly, Collins, it seems 
fine to me as it is.

16
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,857
I think you've pushed the erotic
angle about as far as you can.

17
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,438
"The erotic angle?"

18
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:50,491
You call that erotic?

19
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:55,848
Mr. Ferrari, where have 
you been all these years?

20
00:04:56,508 --> 00:05:00,588
When I catch the genius who made
this headdress, I'm going to make
him eat it.

21
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,088
You should wear it all the time.
It does wonders for you.

22
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:05,147
And the kitties?

23
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:11,064
Besides, what does the victim 
seducing the killer have to do 
with anything?

24
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:15,227
All right, it has nothing to
do with it.

25
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:18,327
But can you imagine the
effect on the public?

26
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:22,087
The victim rapes her own murderer.

27
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:24,247
It'll be sensational.

28
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:27,807
- Betty!
- What is it?

29
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,227
My zipper's caught again.

30
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:32,191
Again?

31
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:35,907
I'm here to protect my investors, 
not your precious career!

32
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:41,247
A losing battle in any case.

33
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:46,387
- How's your ankle?
- It's killing me.

34
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:51,287
- You shouldn't be working at all.
- Yeah, tell that to my landlord.

35
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:56,047
In case it slipped your mind, 
the show opens in one week.

36
00:05:56,827 --> 00:06:00,527
And as you can see, these
people literally stink.

37
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:05,547
At this point, either you let
me do things my way, or say
goodbye to your --

38
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,107
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,167
Mark!

40
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:19,687
Get this damn cat out of here.

41
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,707
And call Sybil on-stage.

42
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,887
Sybil!

43
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,006
Sybil, you're on.

44
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:30,776
Yes?

45
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:33,430
What?

46
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:38,793
Oh.  It's positive.

47
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,126
Well, what's it gonna be?

48
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,254
Do I carry on or
do we all go home?

49
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,566
There seems to be a misunderstanding.
I'm not criticizing your work,

50
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,266
I just want you to 
keep in mind one thing:

51
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:59,506
That there are some people who like
to fondle the dancers' asses backstage

52
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:06,326
and some who like to see the dancers'
asses under the lights onstage.

53
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:10,106
I swear to God I'm going to
kill whoever made this costume.

54
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:15,906
Stop bitching, honey.  You can always
go back to microwaving chili at 
Mexico Joe's.

55
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,036
Yeah?

56
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,202
And you can go back to selling your ass 
in the mens' room at the bus station, darling.

57
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:26,396
Dominique.  Dominique!

58
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:28,578
All right, come on.
Back to work.

59
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:30,838
Let's get going with 
the scene change.

60
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,916
Is everything ready?
Mark!

61
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:36,276
Alicia, take a break.

62
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:39,626
I don't want to watch any
more of that crap.

63
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:43,136
- Where's Sybil?
- She's coming.

64
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:46,416
Wow, he's sure tough on you.

65
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,616
- It's positive, Danny.
- Christ.

66
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:52,496
Don't worry.  After all,
it's not the first time.

67
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,056
- Sybil.
- Coming!

68
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,396
Okay, we'll talk later.

69
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:03,836
- Betty, have you seen my purse?
- No.  Where did you leave it?

70
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:05,419
I don't know.

71
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,375
All my money's in it,
and my watch.

72
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:12,796
Okay, I'll go look in
the dressing room.

73
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,528
- Everything okay, Alicia?
- Yes, thanks.  Everything's fine.

74
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:28,208
If there's anything
I can do to help...

75
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:31,188
How about an advance to cover
rehearsal time?  I'm broke.

76
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:36,748
That will be fine, but finish
with that arm up, all right?

77
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,501
And decisive.  Good.

78
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,608
That's all right.

79
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:48,028
Okay, let's run through
the rape scene.

80
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:49,919
Get Laurel.

81
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,417
Ms. Laurel?

82
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:56,493
Ms. Laurel?

83
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:02,469
Ms. Laurel!

84
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:17,193
Is our Cinderella
ready to do her scene?

85
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,935
Or does she need more
time to warm up?

86
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:21,773
Brett, you're a fucking bastard.

87
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:24,253
A rose by any other name...

88
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:29,173
Okay, let's do it.
Music!

89
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:35,053
God, I can't find my watch.

90
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,053
Here it is.

91
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,353
Wow, you must be crazy to
leave it lying around like that.

92
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,613
You're right.  If I didn't have
this job, I'd have to pawn it.

93
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:05,793
Don't worry, dear.
It's only mother.

94
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,813
What's our bright-eyed 
ingenue reading now?

95
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:11,853
- Stanislavski.
- Oh, saints preserve us!

96
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:15,013
If an actor prepares, it's fantastic.

97
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:20,081
Let me know when you get to the part
about earning enough money to keep
body and soul together.

98
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,310
That's information I can use.

99
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:27,401
Look at Laurel.  She's the perfect
example of the method.  She really
feels her parts.

100
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,221
Keep it up, sweetie!

101
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,541
Here.  This is a hospital.  It's 
only five minutes from here.  Come on.

102
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:39,521
Oh, Betty, that bastard would
never give me permission to go.

103
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:43,201
Look, if you're ankle gets any
worse you'll be out of a job
in a flash.

104
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:46,981
Don't be an idiot.  We'll go ask
Willy and he'll let us out the side door.  

105
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:48,841
Come on, let's go.

106
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:00,046
Willy!

107
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:01,878
Damn!

108
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:07,821
Willy, do us a favor and
let us go out the service entrance.

109
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:12,911
- Now, y'all know Mr. Collins doesn't want anybody --
- Willy, this is an emergency.

110
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:17,171
All right.

111
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,811
- There you are Lucifer --
- Willy, let us go out first.

112
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:36,111
Remember when you come back, lock the door
and put the key back on the shelf.

113
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:37,591
Okay.  Thanks.

114
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:40,531
What is it, Betty?

115
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,245
The cat.  It crossed my path.

116
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:47,331
- Are you superstitious?
- I guess, a little.

117
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:58,911
(Betty)
How come Peter's so mean to you?

118
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:01,551
(Alicia)
Because he left his shrink in London.

119
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:06,342
(Betty)
Oh, come on.  He's not crazy.
He's just panting for your body

120
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:10,011
- so let him pant a little longer.
- Too late.

121
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:13,214
What he wants is
a repeat performance.

122
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:16,269
But I won't share him 
with his little chums.

123
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:55,563
Jack.

124
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,520
It's supper time.

125
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,403
How's your appetite?

126
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,383
Betty, this is a mental institution.

127
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,640
Pyschiatrists are 
doctors too, aren't they?

128
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:07,516
Tell Alice to get ready.
We'll skip ahead to the next
scene, okay?

129
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:08,576
Okay.

130
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:18,596
(Nurse)
Now just one minute, honey. You're 
the one who doesn't understand 

131
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,798
this is a psychiatric hospital,
not a first aid station.

132
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:25,956
Even if your friend was Liza Minelli,
she'd still have to be crazy to get in here.

133
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:29,156
And if you don't mind, I want that car
removed immediately from our entrance.

134
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:30,298
It's blocking the door.

135
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,036
- Come on, it's no use.  Let's go.
- Wise decision.

136
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:34,126
You know something?
You're really mean.

137
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,611
Sheila, who are these
lovely ladies?

138
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,919
- Oh, doctor...
- Let us explain...

139
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:41,116
- Don't worry...
- This is an emergency.

140
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:44,456
It's all right, girls.
It's all right, it's all right.

141
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:47,356
We have a show in rehearsal.
she's a dancer 

142
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,292
and she twisted her ankle. 
Would you please have a look at it?

143
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:54,806
- What sort of show is it?
- It's a kind of intellectual musical.

144
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:56,635
Interesting.  I'm fascinated
with the theater...

145
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:06,995
It's no bed of roses.  One false
step and "Wham!"  You're finished.

146
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,152
I can understand that.

147
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:12,036
But doing it is magic.
Once you're stage-front, that's it.

148
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:15,151
You go up and down
like a rollercoaster.

149
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,131
You have to hang on for dear life
and pray you'll make it one day.

150
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:20,245
It's like a disease.
It's all crazy.

151
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:22,390
So it looks like you came to
the right place after all.

152
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,871
Sorry, miss.  You can't stand here.

153
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:45,351
Ali, what are you doing?
The doctor's waiting.

154
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:46,301
Coming.

155
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:00,371
But who gave her 
permission to leave?

156
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,571
No one leaves the studio
without asking me.

157
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:06,871
- Well, the young lady wasn't
feeling too good so I thought --
- I couldn't care less!

158
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,607
(Mark)
Sorry, Peter.
I guess she got by me.

159
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:14,671
And just what the hell 
do you think you're supposed 
to be doing here, then?  Hm?

160
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,466
I just saw a 
metal door with bars.

161
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:30,604
Who's in there?

162
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:31,646
Irving Wallace.

163
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,258
Irving Wallace? You mean
that actor who went berserk?

164
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,586
The same.  We're keeping him here
while the court reviews his case.

165
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:39,326
I've never heard about him.
What did he do?

166
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,086
But it was in
all the papers.

167
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:45,701
God, he did horrible things. He 
killed people and chopped them
up into little pieces.

168
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,346
- I think he killed twelve people.
- Sixteen, actually.

169
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:52,926
- Why?
- Who can say?  He doesn't talk a lot.

170
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:57,986
That should kill the pain for
three or four hours, but try 
to keep off it as much as you can.

171
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,766
- Thank you so much, doctor.
- Well, the show must go on, I suppose.

172
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:04,086
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

173
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:08,536
He's a really handsome guy.

174
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,097
Sometimes I think I'm 
in the wrong business.

175
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:18,309
Look, that must be
Irving Wallace in there.

176
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:21,126
Come on, Betty.  If we don't
hurry up, Peter will kill us.

177
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:45,669
- What's the matter, does it still hurt?
- No, it's much better.

178
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,529
- I was just thinking...
- What?

179
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,229
About that guy.  Wallace.

180
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:56,009
Listen to this.  His last victim
was a sixteen year old girl...

181
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,449
...and he nailed her to the floor
and then he cut her into pieces.

182
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,129
I don't want to hear.
That's horrible!

183
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,129
I'll leave the door open
but hurry up.

184
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,987
Well, look who's here.
Where on earth have you been?

185
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,747
- Was I called?
- Every name in the book, honey.

186
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:32,427
Oh, hell...

187
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:56,127
Let's run through that again.
Without music.

188
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:57,507
Keep your heads up.

189
00:18:58,851 --> 00:18:59,700
Right?

190
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,506
One, two, and...

191
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:07,881
One, two, three four, five,
six, seven eight -- stop!

192
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:10,352
We have a visitor.

193
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,394
Have you forgotten something?

194
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,258
I'm really sorry, Peter.

195
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,192
I thought...

196
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:24,072
You thought certain rules
didn't apply to you.  Eh?

197
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,672
I hurt myself.

198
00:19:27,452 --> 00:19:28,572
Aw.  I'm awfully
sorry about that.

199
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:33,512
You better go home and take care
of whatever it is that's hurting you.

200
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:40,592
And before you go, would you clean out
your dressing room and give the key
to Laurel?

201
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,872
She's taking over your role.

202
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:48,572
All right, let's run through 
that again.  Cue the music.

203
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,479
All right?
Music!

204
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:56,772
Oh gosh, I left the lights on.

205
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,056
God, get out of here!

206
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,632
I'm very sorry about this.

207
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,733
Forget it.

208
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:55,292
I think Peter went a little overboard.
I could talk to him.

209
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:57,652
Let me help you.

210
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:01,972
I don't need the kind of help
you're offering, thanks.  Get
out of my way!

211
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:11,812
- Danny, have you seen Betty?
- No.

212
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:13,195
Sorry, Alicia.

213
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:15,092
Not as sorry as I am.

214
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,087
See you.

215
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:18,615
Bye.

216
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:21,992
- Bye, Willy.
- Take it easy.

217
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:24,772
- Ali.
- Yeah?

218
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,752
Have you seen Lucifer?  My cat?

219
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,432
- Who?
- Lucifer, my cat.

220
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:05,863
Lucifer? That you?

221
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,400
Where are you?

222
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:10,223
Kitty!

223
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:14,488
Where are you?

224
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:19,783
Come here.

225
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,346
Here, Lucifer!

226
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,511
Where the hell are you?

227
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,209
Wretched cat.

228
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,926
Where the hell are you?

229
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:41,643
Lucifer!

230
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:44,115
Lucifer?

231
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,319
Lucifer!

232
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:57,777
Okay, Peter, just show me how
you want it, for God's sake.

233
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:00,328
Just push her back like --

234
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:04,024
What's going on now?

235
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,504
It's Betty!

236
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,139
What the hell's going on?

237
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:20,567
We covered the whole area but
there's no trace of the killer.

238
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:22,743
He seems to have vanished
into thin air.

239
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,785
This studio's only got
two entrances.

240
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:39,885
The service door is real
solid and is kept locked.

241
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:42,565
The guard says he's been watching
the main entrance all the time.

242
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:43,905
Have you checked inside?

243
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:45,702
We looked everywhere, sir.

244
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:47,970
All right.  Get your men
together and move out.

245
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:51,441
Leave a patrol car here, get it?
To keep an eye on things.

246
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,585
Come on, guys.
Let's go inside.

247
00:24:57,505 --> 00:24:59,108
Sybil, we're going inside.

248
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:01,144
Honestly, she has no enemies.

249
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:02,505
Do you know why anyone
would do such a thing?

250
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:03,533
No.

251
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:06,897
- She came out of there?
And can I quote you?
- Sure.

252
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,625
We'll be going now.  There'll 
be a police car here all night.

253
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,395
Do you think you'll catch him?

254
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:24,026
We're combing the neighborhood.
It's just a question of time.

255
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,107
Thank you.

256
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:29,748
Peter, the rehearsal hours are over.
Should I send the kids home?

257
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:32,522
Yep.  But not everybody.

258
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:37,608
Ask Laurel, Corinne,
Brett, Sybil and Danny...

259
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:41,390
...and Alicia to stay behind
for a while.  I'll explain later.

260
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:43,598
Mark?

261
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:48,234
Tell that journalist
I'd like a word with him.

262
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:49,592
Okay.

263
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:02,828
What a disaster.  And just
a week from opening night.

264
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:09,028
A disaster for that poor girl,
all right.  But not necessarily
for us.

265
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:15,028
Anyway, it's not a week 'til
opening night.  It's three days.

266
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,908
We open on Saturday.

267
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:19,221
You crazy?

268
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:24,768
You get some extra money together and I 
promise you, in three days this show will open.

269
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:29,328
Tomorrow, when the newspapers 
hit the streets, 

270
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:33,786
there's going to be a line 
a block long outside our box office.

271
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:36,370
Get it?

272
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:43,791
Come on.  Let's have 
a little talk with the journalist.

273
00:26:58,231 --> 00:26:59,171
Bye, Mark.

274
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:00,897
Bye.

275
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:08,991
- Who's going to tell her family?
- The police will handle it.

276
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:11,491
She wasn't from around here.
Came from Boston.

277
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:13,571
Did you know her well?

278
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:16,691
No, we only hired her
two days ago

279
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:19,377
for the costumes and, well,
you know...

280
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,671
Mr. Collins, I'm going now.
This is the key.

281
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:25,242
- Peter --
- Just a minute.

282
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:28,911
Y'all make sure those fires
are out before you leave, and
lock up good.

283
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:31,213
- All right, sure.
- Later.

284
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:35,431
What's happening, Peter?
Can we leave?

285
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:39,091
No.  We're going to carry on.

286
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:45,131
First, can you do me
a little favor?

287
00:27:46,451 --> 00:27:49,551
Lock the door
and hide the key.

288
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:53,531
Go on.  Do as your director says.

289
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:16,915
I just want to 
say a few words.

290
00:28:19,555 --> 00:28:23,775
What's happened tonight has been
a horrifying experience for
everybody here.

291
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:28,695
But we mustn't let it 
demoralize us.  We must 
carry on.

292
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:30,685
At least for Betty's sake.

293
00:28:31,355 --> 00:28:33,495
So let's take ten minutes' break.

294
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:36,970
Let's get ready, let's get 
concentrated, let's get
back to work.  Right?

295
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:41,095
Alicia, that applies to you, too.

296
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:43,715
Mark?

297
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,676
Give me the script. 
I want to make some changes.

298
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,935
Nobody said 
anything about overtime.

299
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,195
You'll be paid immediately.

300
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:57,331
At this very moment, Mr. Ferrari
is preparing the cash.

301
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:05,375
I talked to some journalists outside
and they told me some things about
our psychopathic killer.

302
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:10,614
For instance, Brett: 
your character will no longer be
an anonymous owl.

303
00:29:11,704 --> 00:29:15,404
He will have a real name.
Irving Wallace.

304
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:18,444
How lucky for you, Peter.

305
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:24,806
(Brett, sing-song)
There's no business
like show business...

306
00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:26,844
Well, goodnight everybody.

307
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,524
The changes we've got to make
are mostly in opening scenes.

308
00:29:35,124 --> 00:29:37,124
Peter, open this door.

309
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:40,864
Open the door!

310
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:42,411
All right!

311
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:45,804
I'll open the door.

312
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:51,777
And everyone can go home, and stay home,
and we'll forget the whole thing and
cancel the show.

313
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:56,344
How long had you been out 
of work before this, Alicia?

314
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:59,524
Laurel? Brett?

315
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:02,844
How about Sybil and Danny?

316
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:07,204
You all accepted this job on
a percentage basis because you
were in the shit.

317
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:10,784
None of you are stars.  Nor am I.

318
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:13,824
But this is our big chance.

319
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:17,444
We can fill the theater and get a
five or six month run out of this.

320
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:21,184
You know that people have a
morbid curiosity about murder.

321
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:23,784
And they're going to line up
for blocks to see a show

322
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:27,904
in which one of the actresses has
been murdered by the real-life
maniac in the plot.

323
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,784
Can't you understand that?

324
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,990
But Betty wasn't an actress.

325
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,850
I told the newspapers she was.

326
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,830
It wasn't enough to say she was
just a little wardrobe mistress.

327
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:43,891
- You're scum.
- No I'm not.

328
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,210
I'm honestly shattered
about Betty.

329
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,730
But I need the money.

330
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:55,768
And I need a hit.

331
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,430
Just like all the rest of you.

332
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,730
Here's your money.

333
00:31:26,996 --> 00:31:30,696
How do you like this weather?
Rain, damp, humidity.

334
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:32,416
It's all great for my rheumatism. 

335
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:53,576
- Sybil!
- Look, please...

336
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,416
I feel sick just like last time.

337
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,716
Uh-uh, Sybil.  Not like last time.
There'll be no abortion this time.

338
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:07,796
I don't want you to.

339
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:10,716
- But Danny, you know what we said --
- I know.

340
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:13,796
But we'll make it.  You'll see.

341
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,727
We're going to be rich and famous with
our names up in lights ten feet high.

342
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:20,796
All three of us?

343
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:29,423
What is this?  The Late, Late Show
starring Mickey Rooney, 
Judy Garland and Shirley Temple?

344
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,724
- Brett, get into costume, will you?
- Don't rush me, "Gloria."

345
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:39,544
Laurel, Peter says to find something
sexier in wardrobe.  There's a 
new number for you.

346
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,837
Move it, everyone, will you?
We haven't got all night.

347
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:43,661
Move it, come on!

348
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:12,604
All right, guys.

349
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:15,386
No stupid jokes tonight, okay?

350
00:35:12,078 --> 00:35:14,518
Brett, you cut it out right 
now or I'm going to scream.

351
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:39,371
- My God, that sounds like Laurel!
- What's going on?

352
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:43,451
What the hell's going on?

353
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:46,211
God damn it, Brett, you make
me sick!

354
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,249
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

355
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:49,613
Don't you know that I'm freaking out?

356
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,251
All right, cut that out,
both of you!

357
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,635
We're quite late enough as it is.

358
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:59,051
Brett, I don't want
anymore of your jokes.

359
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:01,196
- But I--it wasn't me!
- Is that clear?

360
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,791
Hurry up and get on-stage.

361
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:07,911
I can't.  I can't find
my costume.

362
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,391
Well, look for it!

363
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,029
If you can't find it,
wear the spare.

364
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:21,071
Brett, the truth.
It was you, wasn't it?

365
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:24,291
Give me a break.
I swear it wasn't me.

366
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,291
I mean tonight, of all nights.
I wouldn't!

367
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:28,891
Who was it, then?

368
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:31,347
Probably that dirty
letch, Ferrari.

369
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:34,331
Where the hell is it?

370
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:39,251
Here it is.

371
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:52,271
And now, ladies and gentlemen:
Irving Wallace.

372
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:56,571
Thank you, thank you.

373
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,711
- Brett's not here.
- Call him, then.

374
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:08,571
Danny, would you mind working
the music and the lights?

375
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:11,051
This is the cue sheet.
Just follow the numbers.

376
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:14,511
Brett, go on.

377
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,620
Brett's waiting in
the wings, Peter.

378
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:21,059
Okay.

379
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,420
- Corinne?  Ready?
- Ready.

380
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,300
Okay.  Lights?

381
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,069
And music!

382
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:36,036
-So when I heard Peter was doing 
a show in America, I said to Danny --
-Shh!

383
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,440
The hair.

384
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,840
Your lover.

385
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:03,712
Reaching...

386
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:16,481
and...

387
00:38:39,724 --> 00:38:40,824
(Peter)
To the bed.

388
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,417
(Peter)
Brett?

389
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:44,666
Where's Brett?

390
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:49,164
- Peter.  Peter!
- Not now.

391
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,744
Brett, that's your cue.
What are you waiting for?

392
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:57,464
Brett, what are you waiting for?

393
00:39:02,784 --> 00:39:03,804
(Peter)
Monster...

394
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:08,974
The service entrance is locked
and the key's gone!

395
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,078
What are you talking about?

396
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,873
Don't just stand there.
Grab her!

397
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:16,326
(Peter)
Grab her!

398
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:21,804
That's it.

399
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:29,414
Brett --

400
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,747
Listen to me.  I think that 
maniac is hiding in here.

401
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:33,527
Have you gone 
out of your mind?

402
00:39:34,327 --> 00:39:36,207
Go on, kill her!
Kill her!

403
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:40,047
Jesus Christ, what's the knife
got to do with anything?

404
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:44,387
That's not Brett!  Stop him!

405
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,958
- She's still alive!  Oh, no...
- Don't touch her.

406
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:06,907
Mark, call an ambulance.
Hurry.

407
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:10,007
- Why did he do it?
- It wasn't Brett, don't you understand?

408
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:12,667
Then where is Brett?

409
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:23,527
Corinne, lie still.
The doctor's on his way.

410
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:26,327
The telephone is dead.
Somebody's ripped the wires
out of the wall.

411
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,047
The police car's outside.

412
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:33,907
The main door's locked, Peter.
Give me the key!

413
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:35,378
Where's the key?

414
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,827
I gave it to Corinne.

415
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:45,427
Corinne, the key to the main door.
Where did you put it?

416
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:50,627
The key!  Where's the
key, for God's sake?

417
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:52,247
Leave her alone!

418
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,035
She's dead.

419
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,646
We've got to find the key!
We've got to find the key!

420
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:59,527
This is her bag.
Maybe it's in here.

421
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,519
It's not here.

422
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:11,907
I told Corinne to hide it.

423
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:14,187
- The service entrance.
- That's locked, too.

424
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,084
We're locked in.

425
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:19,647
If we yell, maybe
the police would hear us.

426
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,597
They'll hear us!

427
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,871
Let us out!

428
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:30,887
Help!

429
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:39,947
My little wife is worried about 
my health, so what do I get?  Spinach. 

430
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:41,892
Can you believe it? 
Spinach!

431
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:43,836
You're too fat anyway.

432
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:47,448
Too fat?
That's muscle, boy.

433
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:51,704
- She thinks you're Popeye.
- Fuck Popeye.

434
00:41:58,187 --> 00:42:00,227
Somebody help us!
Open the door!

435
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:02,884
Please!  Please!

436
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:18,207
(Peter)
It's no good.  They'll
never hear us.

437
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:24,307
We've got to find the key.

438
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:29,067
All right.  Don't panic.

439
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:30,728
Stay close together.

440
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:32,606
We've got to look for 
a flashlight somewhere.

441
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:34,567
I think there's some candles
in make-up, Peter.

442
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:37,792
All right, let's go then.
Stick together.

443
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:39,381
Stick together, right?

444
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:50,547
Wait!

445
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,698
So what are we
going to do now?

446
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:08,778
We're going to look for the key.

447
00:43:10,263 --> 00:43:13,509
- All right, come on.  Let's --
- Peter?  Where is Ferrari?

448
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,251
Ferrari?

449
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:40,584
Ferrari?

450
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:45,897
Where's he gone to?

451
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,011
Ferrari?

452
00:44:50,696 --> 00:44:51,572
Ferrari!

453
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:12,086
Let's get out of here.
Back to the girls!

454
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,920
I don't understand.  He's got 
the key, why doesn't he go?

455
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,820
He could try to 
escape in the dark.

456
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:36,169
Yeah, he'll go, all right. But
only after he's killed every
last one of us!

457
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,200
Cut that out!

458
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:39,716
There's six of us.

459
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:42,205
He's not going 
to kill all of us.

460
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,280
We'll just have to 
stay in here all night.

461
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,020
But it's 10:00 now.  Willy
doesn't get here 'til 8:30.

462
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,780
I can't stay here all night,
I'll go crazy!  Don't you
understand that?

463
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,060
But Peter, we can't
stay in here.

464
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:58,829
He could block the doors and
set fire to the whole place. 

465
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:08,865
That was a drill bit.

466
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,665
Do you realize?

467
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:15,145
That was a drill bit.

468
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:05,145
Maybe there's a 
skeleton key somewhere?

469
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:08,085
It's kept in Willy's office.
I saw it in there once.

470
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:09,945
Well let's go!
What are we waiting for?

471
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:11,706
All together, though.

472
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:14,767
All right.

473
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,567
I can't.  My ankle hurts
too much.  I'll never make it.

474
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:24,347
You just stay here, then.
Lock yourself in.

475
00:47:24,547 --> 00:47:27,287
No.  No one is to be
left on their own.

476
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:35,527
It's still hurting a lot?

477
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:40,227
Sorry.

478
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:43,487
I should have listened 
to you in the first place.

479
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,527
Maybe Corinne would
still be alive.

480
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,627
Maybe they would all still be
alive if she'd listened to you.

481
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:54,887
You heard what the police said.
She brought him back with her.

482
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:57,887
Stop it!  Do you want to
kill each other now?

483
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,364
Let's keep calm, all right?

484
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:05,504
Danny and I...

485
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:08,264
...will go to the office.

486
00:48:09,484 --> 00:48:10,384
And Mark...

487
00:48:12,302 --> 00:48:13,384
Stay here with the girls.

488
00:48:14,197 --> 00:48:15,828
I can't leave Sybil in here.

489
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:21,436
Christ's sake, will you do
what I say?  Otherwise, none
of us will get out of here alive.

490
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:24,084
Go on.  We'll be all right.

491
00:48:25,464 --> 00:48:26,924
Please.

492
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:31,244
All right?

493
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:42,312
- Will you stop mewling?
- Can't you leave her alone?

494
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:45,602
It's getting on my nerves.  And 
so you know, you're getting on
my nerves -- 

495
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,790
Stop it. Let's try and 
keep calm, eh?

496
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,320
I'm sick!

497
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,060
Oh, wouldn't you know it?

498
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:58,938
Wouldn't you know it...

499
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:21,756
Mark?

500
00:50:30,882 --> 00:50:32,342
Help me push!
Push!

501
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:04,172
Sybil!  Stop it 

502
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:06,662
and do something!

503
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:26,872
Sybil.

504
00:51:33,214 --> 00:51:34,309
Sybil!

505
00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:48,166
No!

506
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:07,040
All right.  That's enough.

507
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,170
I'm not going to sit around here

508
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,332
to be slaughtered like a pig.

509
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:21,312
He got that in the workshop.
Why didn't I think of it
before?  The workshop!

510
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,592
We can find everything
we need to defend ourselves.

511
00:52:25,196 --> 00:52:26,436
And to get out of here.

512
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:27,801
All right.

513
00:52:28,236 --> 00:52:31,776
Come on.  And this time
we stick together.

514
00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:34,296
Alicia, can you make it?

515
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:37,206
You look after her.

516
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:40,476
Follow me.

517
00:53:12,976 --> 00:53:14,696
I want to try to
force the door.

518
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:27,343
Okay.

519
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,116
I'm ready.

520
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,063
Let's go.

521
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:04,213
- Go on ahead.
- What are you going to do?

522
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:06,403
Do as I say.

523
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,583
- There he is!
- Oh, God!

524
00:54:21,824 --> 00:54:22,871
Up there!

525
00:54:28,783 --> 00:54:30,643
- Come on!  Hurry!
- No, Peter, don't!

526
00:54:31,743 --> 00:54:34,323
Danny, that way.
Cut him off.

527
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,042
Run.

528
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:37,843
Hurry!

529
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:48,343
Danny! Danny!
Danny, wait for me!

530
00:55:23,472 --> 00:55:24,592
Wait for me, Laurel!

531
00:55:26,468 --> 00:55:27,499
Let go of me!

532
00:55:56,012 --> 00:55:57,492
He's gone in there.

533
00:55:58,462 --> 00:55:59,404
Come on.

534
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,308
Danny!
Die!  Die!  Die!

535
00:56:42,008 --> 00:56:43,948
Stop it, Peter.
That's enough!

536
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:46,248
It's over.

537
00:56:46,762 --> 00:56:50,161
Jesus Christ, it's over.

538
00:56:52,148 --> 00:56:53,748
His hands are tied.

539
00:57:02,728 --> 00:57:05,008
- It's Brett.
- Brett.  Christ.

540
00:57:09,913 --> 00:57:11,213
Then where's the killer?

541
00:57:12,294 --> 00:57:14,821
So he's still alive.

542
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:17,047
He's still alive!

543
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:22,497
Sybil!

544
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,595
Help me, for God's sake!

545
00:57:31,687 --> 00:57:32,523
Peter!

546
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:34,274
Peter!

547
00:57:58,373 --> 00:57:59,573
Danny, no.

548
00:57:59,864 --> 00:58:03,147
What are you doing?
Wait!  He's crazy!

549
00:58:38,896 --> 00:58:40,036
Don't leave me!

550
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:46,516
Peter!

551
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:48,314
Peter, wait for me!

552
00:59:02,508 --> 00:59:03,834
Peter, there he is!

553
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:15,356
Get away from me.
Get away!

554
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:17,635
Stop!

555
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:22,078
Why are you doing this?  What's
the point of killing me, too? 

556
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:24,808
Listen.  Listen!

557
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,068
You leave me alone

558
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:31,919
and I leave you alone.  All right?

559
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:49,037
No!

560
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:57,268
What's the matter with that
mechanic?  I think it's a short.

561
00:59:57,488 --> 00:59:59,108
He should have seen it,
for Christ's sake.

562
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:09,768
(inaudible)

563
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:24,834
Laurel?

564
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:28,603
Laurel!

565
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:33,353
Where is everybody?

566
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:04,281
Don't you think I look
a little like James Dean?

567
01:06:05,701 --> 01:06:07,661
Sure, and I look
like Marlon Brando.

568
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:12,341
A little bit.

569
01:19:15,934 --> 01:19:17,001
Get away!

570
01:19:17,594 --> 01:19:19,761
No!  No!

571
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:49,807
Miss.  Miss!

572
01:22:51,268 --> 01:22:53,463
(male reporter)
Miss, can I ask some question?
Are you hurt?

573
01:22:54,463 --> 01:22:55,897
Did you kill him?

574
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,059
How did you do it?

575
01:22:58,822 --> 01:22:59,995
Miss, how did you do it?

576
01:23:00,204 --> 01:23:01,501
(female reporter)
Did you know the killer?

577
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:03,480
(male reporter)
Miss.

578
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:06,424
Did you kill him?

579
01:23:08,175 --> 01:23:45,000
(reporters continue)

580
01:23:48,376 --> 01:23:49,556
Feeling better now?

581
01:23:51,036 --> 01:23:52,136
Yes, thank you.

582
01:23:53,401 --> 01:23:54,811
And thank you for this.

583
01:23:55,416 --> 01:23:56,836
Would you like me
to call a taxi for you?

584
01:23:58,516 --> 01:23:59,716
- That is kind.
- All right.

585
01:24:09,196 --> 01:24:10,256
My watch.

586
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,836
Willy?

587
01:24:33,494 --> 01:24:34,398
Willy!

588
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,776
What're you doing here, Miss Ali?

589
01:24:37,956 --> 01:24:41,156
Willy, I lost my watch.
I think it must be inside.

590
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,140
I can't let you in.  The police
told me I can't let anybody in.

591
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,780
Willy, it's very expensive.
I've got to find it.

592
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,680
I can't disobey my orders.

593
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,040
Willy, please.

594
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:55,006
Pretty please?

595
01:24:55,980 --> 01:25:00,600
Okay, honey.  I'll do
anything for you.

596
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,720
It's already in the
afternoon newspapers.

597
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,800
There's a picture of you, too.

598
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,240
They call it
"The Soundstage Massacre."

599
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,560
"Eight horribly mutilated 
bodies were found

600
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:24,778
at the Modern Studios this morning as police..."

601
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,800
- You all right, Ali?
- Yeah.  I'm fine.

602
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,620
The gun you found
wasn't empty, you know.

603
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,880
It was loaded all right, only
you forgot to take the safety off.

604
01:25:38,107 --> 01:25:40,328
You would've gotten him 
if you'd taken off the safety.

605
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:42,604
That gun's a cannon.

606
01:25:43,937 --> 01:25:45,533
I would've blown his
head off with it.

607
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,706
Bet your bottom dollar, I'd have
got him right between the eyes.

608
01:25:50,402 --> 01:25:51,785
You could've handled that gun.

609
01:25:52,501 --> 01:25:53,886
That gun shoots by itself.

610
01:25:54,647 --> 01:25:57,917
You just have to know to
remove the safety.  It's easy.

611
01:25:59,378 --> 01:26:01,330
But you didn't put a
bullet in the chamber.

612
01:26:09,819 --> 01:26:11,259
Willy, I found it!

613
01:26:25,999 --> 01:26:27,639
(remembering)
They call it
"The Soundstage Massacre...

614
01:26:28,519 --> 01:26:30,399
Eight horribly mutilated bodies
were found at 

615
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,599
the Modern Studios
this morning as police..."

616
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,139
(thinking)
Eight?

617
01:26:40,212 --> 01:26:41,732
(thinking)
Why eight?

618
01:26:47,195 --> 01:26:48,171
(thinking)
Laurel...

619
01:26:54,368 --> 01:26:56,272
(thinking)
...Brett, Mark...

620
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,068
(thinking)
...Sybil, Danny...

621
01:27:01,733 --> 01:27:02,489
(thinking)
...Peter...

622
01:27:04,482 --> 01:27:05,331
(thinking)
...Corinne...

623
01:27:06,963 --> 01:27:07,807
(thinking)
...Ferrari...

624
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,469
And...

625
01:27:20,483 --> 01:27:23,150
Eight.  Where's the ninth?

626
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:32,972
Ali!

627
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,172
I just went to get the gun.

628
01:27:40,478 --> 01:27:43,173
I only wanted to show you how
to put a bullet in the chamber.

629
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:46,184
See that?

630
01:27:46,748 --> 01:27:48,269
I got him right between the eyes.

631
01:27:50,356 --> 01:27:51,604
Just like I said.

632
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:53,662
Right between the eyes.

633
01:27:55,192 --> 01:27:56,332
God damn.

634
01:27:57,553 --> 01:27:59,158
See that, Ali?

635
01:28:00,412 --> 01:28:01,232
Right between the eyes.

636
01:28:04,675 --> 01:28:05,946
Just like I said.

637
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,095
Right...right between the eyes.

638
01:28:12,025 --> 01:28:12,920
Ali.

639
01:28:14,462 --> 01:28:17,015
I got him...right between
the eyes, Ali.

640
01:28:18,046 --> 01:28:20,177
I got the motherfucker
right between the eyes.

641
01:28:24,152 --> 01:28:26,512
Right between the eyes, Ali.

642
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:28,852
Just like I said.

643
01:28:30,752 --> 01:28:31,892
Right between the eyes.

644
