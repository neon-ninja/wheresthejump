1
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:03,029
<b>Gadis, it's me Dewi.</b>

2
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:04,946
<b>Dis.</b>

3
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:08,862
<b>I can't help you this way.</b>

4
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:36,029
<b>Gadis, why don't you ever meet us?</b>

5
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:39,612
<b>We need to stick together, so we don't forget.</b>

6
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:42,571
<b>Together we're strong. You understand, right?</b>

7
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,029
<b>But none of you ever believed me.</b>

8
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,821
<b>You said 'he' attacked you, Gadis.</b>

9
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,696
<b>I felt everything, Dewi.</b>

10
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:55,821
<b>We are free from him.</b>

11
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:57,904
<b>A long time ago.</b>

12
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,654
<b>We're stronger than him.</b>

13
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:09,946
<b>Who did this to you?</b>

14
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:17,279
<b>Why don't you believe me?</b>

15
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:23,987
<b>I don't know.</b>

16
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:26,237
<b>Trust me, Dewi</b>

17
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:30,654
<b>I felt him, the same way I'm feeling you right now.</b>

18
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,571
<b>What do you mean?</b>

19
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:43,737
<b>He's dead. Remember that day, right?</b>

20
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:54,654
<b>He's staring at you right now. Smiling.</b>

21
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,904
<b>I'll stay here tonight.</b>

22
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,487
<b>Yes, Budi?</b>

23
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,862
<b>You're with her?</b>

24
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,487
<b>Yes, with Gadis.</b>

25
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,946
<b>Something's wrong with her.</b>

26
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,487
<b>Bruises all over her body.</b>

27
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,071
<b>Kept saying she was abused.</b>

28
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,696
<b>She said Ayub did it to her.</b>

29
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:14,529
<b>Ayub? She mentioned that name again?</b>

30
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,904
<b>15 years passed and she hasn't moved on-</b>

31
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,362
<b>No one can truly move on from that!</b>

32
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,862
<b>She needs a psychiatrist.</b>

33
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:26,904
<b>What she needs is our support.</b>

34
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:31,612
<b>Understood, but she's always been different since we're</b>
<b>kids.</b>

35
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:36,196
<b>If she's acting up, it's not your responsibility</b>

36
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:38,946
<b>Hello, Dewi?</b>

37
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,654
<b>Bud, call you back.</b>

38
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:42,904
<b>Dewi!</b>

39
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,362
<b>Dewi.</b>

40
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:44,529
<b>Dewi!</b>

41
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,321
<b>Wait!</b>

42
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:35,529
<b>Okay, come in.</b>

43
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,029
<b>..Alfie.</b>

44
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,571
<b>Nara.</b>

45
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:21,696
<b>Nara.</b>

46
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,571
<b>I miss him too.</b>

47
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,987
<b>But we have to move on.</b>

48
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:39,696
<b>We only have each other.</b>

49
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,196
<b>Sleep tight, okay?</b>

50
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:51,737
<b>I love you.</b>

51
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,279
<b>Devil's child..</b>

52
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,571
<b>Wait! Please!</b>

53
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,446
<b>Alfie! Alfie!</b>

54
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,987
<b>Careful! Nara might get hurt.</b>

55
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:45,529
<b>Who are you?!</b>

56
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,987
<b>We meant no harm.</b>

57
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:54,987
<b>Kristi, are you okay?</b>

58
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,112
<b>Everybody's alright?</b>

59
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,362
<b>I'll go first.</b>

60
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:14,946
<b>I'll bring the car to the front.</b>

61
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:16,904
<b>Kristi, stay.</b>

62
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:18,654
<b>Watch for anything suspicious.</b>

63
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,737
<b>Come.</b>

64
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,071
<b>Are you guys crazy?</b>

65
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,362
<b>You put her in there since Jakarta?</b>

66
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:43,362
<b>She could die!</b>

67
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,279
<b>She kept putting a fight.</b>

68
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:47,612
<b>The small one is at the front.</b>

69
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,946
<b>She's alive, right, Sis?</b>

70
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:51,737
<b>Marta, Kristi!</b>

71
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:53,237
<b>Take the little one inside.</b>

72
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:53,821
<b>Yes Sis.</b>

73
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,696
<b>You guys take her.</b>

74
00:14:58,946 --> 00:14:59,571
<b>Okay.</b>

75
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:00,487
<b>Hold her head.</b>

76
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:29,112
<b>Nara!</b>

77
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,196
<b>Rise and shine.</b>

78
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:43,821
<b>Where's Nara?</b>

79
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,071
<b>She's outside.</b>

80
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:51,946
<b>What do you want?</b>

81
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,571
<b>Don't ask too much</b>

82
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:00,904
<b>You're in my room, right?</b>

83
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,529
<b>How's your head?</b>

84
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,654
<b>Still hurts?</b>

85
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:07,612
<b>Bitch..</b>

86
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:15,154
<b>You like being electrocuted?</b>

87
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:22,071
<b>Here, want to get even?</b>

88
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,446
<b>What do you want?</b>

89
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:38,362
<b>Why did you take us here?</b>

90
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:43,654
<b>You'll find out!</b>

91
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:50,446
<b>What's wrong with her?</b>

92
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:52,946
<b>Guess she fell.</b>

93
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:00,154
<b>My name is Budi.</b>

94
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,071
<b>Alfie, I'm Jenar.</b>

95
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:13,779
<b>That's Leo.</b>

96
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,987
<b>First, let me apologize.</b>

97
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,696
<b>- If there's any other way</b>
<b>- One more time!</b>

98
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,112
<b>Where's Nara?</b>

99
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,571
<b>Calm down, Alfie.</b>

100
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,404
<b>I wasn't asking you.</b>

101
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:32,946
<b>She's with the others.</b>

102
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,696
<b>She's okay. Trust me!</b>

103
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:37,654
<b>What do you want from us?</b>

104
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,779
<b>We have nothing.</b>

105
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:41,987
<b>That's not it.</b>

106
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,946
<b>Do you know this place?</b>

107
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:50,071
<b>Bahtera Orphanage.</b>

108
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,404
<b>This was once a place for orphans</b>

109
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,571
<b>built by a childless husband and wife.</b>

110
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,946
<b>This place was once filled with warmth.</b>

111
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:06,404
<b>Who were abandoned by their own birth parents.</b>

112
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,071
<b>But everything changed.</b>

113
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,112
<b>Since the wife passed away.</b>

114
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,029
<b>At that time, there were 7 kids who weren't adopted yet.</b>

115
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,237
<b>Years passed.</b>

116
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:36,029
<b>They grew older.</b>

117
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:41,612
<b>And they were still living here.</b>

118
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:45,946
<b>There they realized.</b>

119
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,404
<b>Not all adults have the intention to keep them safe.</b>

120
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:57,487
<b>Gradually.</b>

121
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,362
<b>This home turned into a terrifying place.</b>

122
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,071
<b>Sir!</b>

123
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:08,821
<b>Sir!</b>

124
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:10,362
<b>Sir!</b>

125
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,154
<b>Please open the door, Sir!</b>

126
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,654
<b>- The one person they considered</b>
<b>- Sir! Please, Sir!</b>

127
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,362
<b>- Became a figure that turn their childhood a living hell.</b>
<b>- Sir! Please, Sir!</b>

128
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,862
<b>Anyone dared to disobey were locked in the kitchen.</b>

129
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:30,529
<b>Without food. Without water. Without lights.</b>

130
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,862
<b>In total silence.</b>

131
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:36,071
<b>Even for days.</b>

132
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,696
<b>Alfie, do you know how it feels going through a nightmare.</b>

133
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:46,529
<b>That never ends?</b>

134
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,404
<b>I know how it feels to wake up from a nightmare.</b>

135
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:58,654
<b>And realize that real life is worse.</b>

136
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,779
<b>Why don't you just cut to the chase.</b>

137
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,237
<b>After this place was closed down.</b>

138
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,696
<b>The children were separated to live in different orphanages.</b>

139
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,237
<b>Living their own lives.</b>

140
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:28,237
<b>But promised to never forget each other.</b>

141
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:46,821
<b>So, the Police didn't know all of you killed the foster</b>
<b>father?</b>

142
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,987
<b>Where was the Police when we were locked up?</b>

143
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,779
<b>- Tortured?</b>
<b>- Leo!</b>

144
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:52,612
<b>- Forced to naked? Forced to</b>
<b>- Leo!</b>

145
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:53,946
<b>Don't worry.</b>

146
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:00,529
<b>You're facing with someone who burnt her own step sister.</b>

147
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,196
<b>Let's go downstairs.</b>

148
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,029
<b>Bud? Cheeky bastard!</b>

149
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:23,446
<b>I'm okay. It's okay!</b>

150
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:25,529
<b>That's for this morning.</b>

151
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,196
<b>From your closet.</b>

152
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:34,446
<b>Are you okay?</b>

153
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:38,446
<b>She's taking too long.</b>

154
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,112
<b>Find her would you?</b>

155
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:41,487
<b>There she is.</b>

156
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,612
<b>Its all neatly cut.</b>

157
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:48,654
<b>Here, eat.</b>

158
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,321
<b>Nara! Nara!</b>

159
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:55,071
<b>Are you okay?</b>

160
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:57,029
<b>I'm okay.</b>

161
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:57,862
<b>Alfie.</b>

162
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:00,196
<b>Sit down.</b>

163
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:10,862
<b>Alfie.</b>

164
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,654
<b>This is Gadis. Marta. And Kristi.</b>

165
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,737
<b>Again, I apologize.</b>

166
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:19,654
<b>We mean no harm to both of you.</b>

167
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:23,529
<b>We're desperate</b>

168
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:25,029
<b>What do you mean?</b>

169
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:26,737
<b>We believe.</b>

170
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:29,029
<b>Our foster father, Mister Ayub,</b>

171
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:31,821
<b>Has returned..for vengeance.</b>

172
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,279
<b>Returned from?</b>

173
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:34,946
<b>Death.</b>

174
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:38,196
<b>Gadis encountered him, she was the first to be attacked.</b>

175
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:41,196
<b>We did'nt believe her. Until</b>

176
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:43,571
<b>Until he killed Dewi.</b>

177
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:45,779
<b>Not 100 % proven, though.</b>

178
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:48,321
<b>I saw it with my own eyes.</b>

179
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,737
<b>Dewi was killed by..</b>

180
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:52,029
<b>Something.</b>

181
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,696
<b>Let's get things straight.</b>

182
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:57,571
<b>There was no other witness, you were alone with Dewi.</b>

183
00:24:58,737 --> 00:24:59,987
<b>What did you say?</b>

184
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:03,404
<b>Have you seen what's done to her body?</b>

185
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,862
<b>None of you ever trusted me.</b>

186
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:08,737
<b>And look what happens.</b>

187
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:11,904
<b>- Because you've always been strange</b>
<b>- Kristi!</b>

188
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,696
<b>If you canÃ•t be supportive then leave.</b>

189
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,696
<b>Just because I doubt, doesn't mean I don't grieve.</b>

190
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,737
<b>Enough. What do you all want?</b>

191
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,821
<b>Nara and I just want to go home.</b>

192
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:40,071
<b>You testified to the Police that your father dealt with</b>
<b>witchcraft</b>

193
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:43,279
<b>And you witnessed it with yourself.</b>

194
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:47,029
<b>There must be a reason why Ayub's able to exist here.</b>

195
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,029
<b>Gadis.</b>

196
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,071
<b>Sorry, Alfie.</b>

197
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:35,196
<b>These must be unpleasantly familiar.</b>

198
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:38,487
<b>Have a drink.</b>

199
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:49,904
<b>Where did that Book come from?</b>

200
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,696
<b>I was a kid then, but I remember..</b>

201
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,862
<b>A woman came over.</b>

202
00:26:58,654 --> 00:27:00,196
<b>She gave the Bible to Ayub.</b>

203
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:02,362
<b>A woman?</b>

204
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,904
<b>I never found out who she was.</b>

205
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:10,737
<b>As Jenar said.</b>

206
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:13,862
<b>Every day was torment for us.</b>

207
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:23,779
<b>I don't know why Ayub gets himself entangled with these</b>
<b>things.</b>

208
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:26,446
<b>In my father's case</b>

209
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,571
<b>..Greed.</b>

210
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:31,196
<b>But Ayub,</b>

211
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,821
<b>Perhaps something to do with his late wife?</b>

212
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,154
<b>Would that kind of ritual brings his wife back?</b>

213
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,154
<b>Bud, come in. How is she?</b>

214
00:27:44,987 --> 00:27:46,654
<b>Everything is okay. Over.</b>

215
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:47,737
<b>Okay.</b>

216
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:50,654
<b>Cellphone's useless around here.</b>

217
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:53,612
<b>Let's go inside.</b>

218
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:55,362
<b>Wait!</b>

219
00:27:56,404 --> 00:27:58,071
<b>I need to know what you want from me?</b>

220
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,112
<b>After Dewi's death.</b>

221
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,737
<b>Marta researched the Bible..</b>

222
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,071
<b>And she believes,</b>

223
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:11,737
<b>Dewi's death is just the beginning.</b>

224
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:16,571
<b>That something embeds in all of us after we killed Ayub.</b>

225
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:21,654
<b>What is it?</b>

226
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:25,904
<b>A curse.</b>

227
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,654
<b>Back then, this room terrifies us the most.</b>

228
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,362
<b>We always felt there's something down there.</b>

229
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:55,404
<b>Ready to come out.</b>

230
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,946
<b>None of you ever go down there?</b>

231
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:23,071
<b>Only Ayub did.</b>

232
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,154
<b>Leo, help me out.</b>

233
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,487
<b>Keep pushing.</b>

234
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:47,779
<b>Let's go.</b>

235
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:51,821
<b>I'm not going.</b>

236
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,654
<b>Thought you don't believe in this.</b>

237
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:56,696
<b>Oh, you're brave huh?</b>

238
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:00,862
<b>Don't want to know what he did down there.</b>

239
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:05,237
<b>Then, take Nara with you?</b>

240
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,529
<b>Nara, stay with Kristi, okay?</b>

241
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:20,696
<b>Marta.</b>

242
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,154
<b>I need you down there.</b>

243
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,196
<b>I'll go first.</b>

244
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:50,779
<b>Jenar.</b>

245
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,946
<b>Alfie, you're truly the one we've been looking for.</b>

246
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,904
<b>- Let's speed things up.</b>
<b>- Where do we start?</b>

247
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,696
<b>We start from where he ends.</b>

248
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:37,862
<b>There's an ancient belief, in the occult world..</b>

249
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,237
<b>Its basic principle, that all humans who worship Demons.</b>

250
00:31:41,237 --> 00:31:44,904
<b>Are obliged to surrender their souls to their Demonic</b>
<b>deities.</b>

251
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,446
<b>There are certain demons that demand</b>

252
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:50,529
<b>sacrificial offerings.</b>

253
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:54,821
<b>These sacrificials is one's proof of ultimate servitude.</b>

254
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:56,779
<b>What is this figure?</b>

255
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,446
<b>An ancient demon.</b>

256
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:02,154
<b>Known as the figure of enlightenment and immortality.</b>

257
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:04,571
<b>It's name is</b>

258
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:06,071
<b>MOLOCH</b>

259
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:12,737
<b>We believe Ayub's plan was to sacrifice all of us.</b>

260
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:15,696
<b>- But before it could happened</b>
<b>- Alfie.</b>

261
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:19,987
<b>You're able to feel it right?</b>

262
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:22,821
<b>To see and sense the unseen?</b>

263
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,946
<b>Alfie, the curse that a demon worshipper cast on us</b>

264
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:31,362
<b>will never disappear.</b>

265
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:34,654
<b>Unless revoked by human who survived</b>

266
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:36,071
<b>from the Devil himself.</b>

267
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:41,821
<b>Alfie, if you can read this 'spell', you can terminate the</b>
<b>curse.</b>

268
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:44,154
<b>I don't understand this.</b>

269
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:55,196
<b>It's alright, Aflie.</b>

270
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:22,946
<b>What are you kids doing?</b>

271
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,821
<b>Little pests! Give me the stairs!</b>

272
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:43,279
<b>Master will never let none of you go.</b>

273
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:28,362
<b>- Alfie! Alfie!</b>
<b>- Alfie!</b>

274
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,862
<b>- Now what?</b>
<b>- Marta, what happened?"</b>

275
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:40,696
<b>- Alfie! Alfie!</b>
<b>- Alfie!</b>

276
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,654
<b>It's freezing.</b>

277
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:14,571
<b>What are you looking at?</b>

278
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:27,029
<b>Hello, Budi?</b>

279
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:29,196
<b>Leo?</b>

280
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:31,071
<b>Hello?</b>

281
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:53,446
<b>Hello?</b>

282
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,237
<b>Kristi?</b>

283
00:36:55,904 --> 00:37:00,571
<b>Kristi belongs to me now, Leo.</b>

284
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:27,904
<b>Budi, look out!</b>

285
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,237
<b>Jenar..</b>

286
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:29,071
<b>Look!</b>

287
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:49,654
<b>What is it now?</b>

288
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,987
<b>Jenar.</b>

289
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:09,612
<b>What happens to Jenar, Alfie?!</b>

290
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:11,612
<b>Alfie, what happens to her?!</b>

291
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:14,987
<b>Alfie! What do you see?</b>

292
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:16,904
<b>Jenar.</b>

293
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:25,154
<b>Jenar!</b>

294
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:31,821
<b>Alfie.</b>

295
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:57,446
<b>Jenar!</b>

296
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:04,654
<b>Jenar!</b>

297
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:26,821
<b>- Budi, Leo?</b>
<b>- Big sis.."</b>

298
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,196
<b>Hello?</b>

299
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,237
<b>- Big sis!</b>
<b>- What the hell?</b>

300
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:32,821
<b>Listen, big sis..</b>

301
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,654
<b>- Sis</b>
<b>- Wait here.</b>

302
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:17,987
<b>Close the door!</b>

303
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:04,654
<b>Budi, hurry! Hurry up!</b>

304
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:15,446
<b>Budi!</b>

305
00:43:16,904 --> 00:43:19,696
<b>Nara, run!</b>

306
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:31,362
<b>Alfie!</b>

307
00:45:32,737 --> 00:45:34,112
<b>Budi!</b>

308
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:36,071
<b>Leo, move away!</b>

309
00:47:51,612 --> 00:47:53,654
<b>Come here, you little shit!</b>

310
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:55,237
<b>Nara!</b>

311
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:56,112
<b>Sis?</b>

312
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:03,237
<b>Alfie, your father sends his regards.</b>

313
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:04,737
<b>- From hell!</b>
<b>- What did you say?</b>

314
00:48:06,112 --> 00:48:07,237
<b>What the fuck did you say?</b>

315
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:10,821
<b>- Do it Alfie, Do it!</b>
<b>- What did you say?</b>

316
00:48:38,071 --> 00:48:40,779
<b>Alfie.</b>

317
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:51,612
<b>Who are you?</b>

318
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:57,446
<b>He's still waiting for you, Alfie.</b>

319
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:05,196
<b>Got away once, be damned..</b>

320
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:08,154
<b>Alfie condemned!</b>

321
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,696
<b>No!</b>

322
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:55,154
<b>She was not your friend anymore.</b>

323
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:56,904
<b>She was like my own sister!</b>

324
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,487
<b>Should've made sure before you murdered her!</b>

325
00:50:01,821 --> 00:50:03,529
<b>I've known Kristi all my life!</b>

326
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:05,654
<b>Then why didn't you stop her?!</b>

327
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:07,237
<b>Show some respect!</b>

328
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:09,487
<b>Please!</b>

329
00:50:20,446 --> 00:50:21,946
<b>You know, Nara?</b>

330
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:25,571
<b>They're just like my own siblings.</b>

331
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:29,904
<b>Even though, they often disregard me.</b>

332
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,154
<b>I know, big sis.</b>

333
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:40,862
<b>I lost my siblings too. My mother.</b>

334
00:50:42,154 --> 00:50:43,696
<b>My Father</b>

335
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:47,446
<b>You're stronger than me. Nara, I'm sorry.</b>

336
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:51,237
<b>And forgive me for getting you involved.</b>

337
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:58,446
<b>No one should go down there again.</b>

338
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:01,779
<b>Best if you seal that door shut.</b>

339
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:03,654
<b>Now!</b>

340
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:05,862
<b>Shit!</b>

341
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:08,612
<b>This is a fucking mess.</b>

342
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:11,987
<b>Once everything's over, we'll give them a proper funeral.</b>

343
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,196
<b>Help me Leo.</b>

344
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:39,237
<b>You!</b>

345
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:42,196
<b>You told me to recite that specific spell!</b>

346
00:51:43,154 --> 00:51:45,612
<b>You said that spell could revoke Ayub's curse.</b>

347
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,112
<b>But look now!</b>

348
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,362
<b>It's true. It can revoke the curse, Alfie.</b>

349
00:51:49,487 --> 00:51:52,029
<b>If I was the only who could read the verse,</b>

350
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:54,404
<b>how would you know which page to read?</b>

351
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:55,987
<b>How?!</b>

352
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,029
<b>Why would I lie? I researched everything and I...</b>

353
00:51:59,071 --> 00:52:02,029
<b>It means either you're wrong or you're lying</b>

354
00:52:02,237 --> 00:52:03,237
<b>Alfie!</b>
<b>- You, shit!</b>

355
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,404
<b>You piece of shit!</b>

356
00:52:06,196 --> 00:52:08,112
<b>Marta has tried her best!</b>

357
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:10,029
<b>I trust her.</b>

358
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:11,154
<b>Yes.</b>

359
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:12,654
<b>You trusted her,</b>

360
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,862
<b>Now two of you are dead!</b>

361
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:17,529
<b>Why should I trust her?</b>

362
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:18,612
<b>Why?!</b>

363
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:20,112
<b>She trusts you, Alfie.</b>

364
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:22,237
<b>Let me go!</b>

365
00:52:25,362 --> 00:52:26,779
<b>Nara, let's go!</b>

366
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:35,946
<b>Alfie!</b>

367
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:42,279
<b>We're leaving now!</b>

368
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:43,987
<b>But you have to help us, Alfie</b>

369
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:45,154
<b>What else huh?</b>

370
00:52:46,321 --> 00:52:48,321
<b>I've done everything you asked me for.</b>

371
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:49,654
<b>Okay,</b>

372
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:51,237
<b>You're right, you did.</b>

373
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:53,321
<b>Budi, are you for real?</b>

374
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:56,446
<b>This is our problem, we have to figure it out.</b>

375
00:52:57,529 --> 00:53:00,029
<b>- I'll take you to the nearest train station.</b>
<b>- Alright</b>

376
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:05,029
<b>We're getting out of here.</b>

377
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:06,404
<b>Go inside.</b>

378
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:09,779
<b>Hurry!</b>

379
00:53:30,112 --> 00:53:31,154
<b>Its not usually like this.</b>

380
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:34,862
<b>Are you serious? You promised.</b>

381
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:36,862
<b>Okay, hold on.</b>

382
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:12,487
<b>Sis?</b>

383
00:54:13,362 --> 00:54:14,154
<b>What's wrong?</b>

384
00:54:19,071 --> 00:54:21,487
<b>We weren't supposed to be here.</b>

385
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:26,321
<b>Calm down, Alfie, take it slow.</b>

386
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:37,112
<b>Relax, we're not going anywhere.</b>

387
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:48,821
<b>What did you say, Nara?</b>

388
00:54:50,279 --> 00:54:53,696
<b>Devil's chid.</b>

389
00:55:08,946 --> 00:55:10,487
<b>What's wrong, Alfie?</b>

390
00:55:12,737 --> 00:55:15,821
<b>Nothing, Nothing.</b>

391
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:32,862
<b>Nara?</b>

392
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:35,446
<b>Budi?</b>

393
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:43,571
<b>Nara?</b>

394
00:56:08,612 --> 00:56:10,654
<b>Alfie..</b>

395
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:56,029
<b>Devil's child.</b>

396
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:08,946
<b>Lesmana?</b>

397
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:12,362
<b>Since when?</b>

398
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:19,696
<b>Be careful, Alfie.</b>

399
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:24,571
<b>It still wants you.</b>

400
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:28,654
<b>- Who?</b>
<b>- You know its name.</b>

401
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,071
<b>No!</b>

402
00:57:30,696 --> 00:57:33,154
<b>All these happened to Nara and I because of you!</b>

403
00:57:33,737 --> 00:57:35,821
<b>This is all your fault, Lesmana!</b>

404
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:42,946
<b>I've tried my best to stop it..</b>

405
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:45,196
<b>But it didn't work.</b>

406
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:53,821
<b>It demands your soul, Alfie</b>

407
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:57,946
<b>He dragged you into this place..</b>

408
00:57:59,196 --> 00:58:01,446
<b>Leave! Alfie, leave this place!</b>

409
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:03,571
<b>- No</b>
<b>- Leave!</b>

410
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:25,321
<b>Alfie, are you okay?</b>

411
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,487
<b>After we lost everything.</b>

412
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:37,446
<b>Nobody really believed in us.</b>

413
00:58:40,779 --> 00:58:45,821
<b>Police. Psychologist. Whatever that is.</b>

414
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:51,237
<b>I began to believe in nothing.</b>

415
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,279
<b>Not knowing what's real and what's not.</b>

416
00:58:57,654 --> 00:59:00,029
<b>I'm afraid I'm losing it, Budi.</b>

417
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:09,696
<b>But twhat's truly scary is realizing..</b>

418
00:59:11,196 --> 00:59:14,196
<b>That this madness is actually real.</b>

419
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:21,237
<b>Alfie! Your arm.</b>

420
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:29,237
<b>How did I end up back here?</b>

421
00:59:29,821 --> 00:59:32,196
<b>You passed out in the car.</b>

422
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:49,446
<b>This was ages ago. I failed..obviously.</b>

423
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:55,321
<b>When Gadis hit a rough patch.</b>

424
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:58,946
<b>I told her to see a psychiatrist.</b>

425
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:01,487
<b>I'm no better than the Police.</b>

426
01:00:02,196 --> 01:00:04,696
<b>Or the psychologist who didn't believe you.</b>

427
01:00:05,446 --> 01:00:08,279
<b>Well, I'm crazier than all of you.</b>

428
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:14,571
<b>Leo's a drunk.</b>

429
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,404
<b>Jenar and Kristi are mostly shut off.</b>

430
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:21,946
<b>Marta's too consumed within her own walls.</b>

431
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:25,362
<b>Myself? I'm no catch.</b>

432
01:00:27,112 --> 01:00:28,446
<b>We never had normal.</b>

433
01:00:31,154 --> 01:00:32,529
<b>It's not your fault.</b>

434
01:00:35,487 --> 01:00:36,779
<b>I saw it myself.</b>

435
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:41,279
<b>Bud..</b>

436
01:00:42,279 --> 01:00:44,654
<b>Ayub will never let you go.</b>

437
01:00:51,404 --> 01:00:54,237
<b>A demon who demands sacrificial children.</b>

438
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:02,279
<b>Why now though?</b>

439
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:07,071
<b>Alfie, when I tried to fix the car,</b>

440
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:09,196
<b>The wires were slashed.</b>

441
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:12,654
<b>Is it possible that these 'things' do that?</b>

442
01:01:13,279 --> 01:01:14,404
<b>I don't know.</b>

443
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:17,112
<b>Until we know what we're dealing with,</b>

444
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:20,321
<b>I need to see that Black Bible now.</b>

445
01:01:25,196 --> 01:01:26,071
<b>Leo,</b>

446
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:28,279
<b>can you come over here with the rest?</b>

447
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:30,529
<b>Bring the Bible.</b>

448
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:38,112
<b>Leo. About the car, I've nothing to do with it.</b>

449
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,987
<b>Best for you not to say anything right now.</b>

450
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:44,737
<b>- Okay?</b>
<b>- But you trust me, right?</b>

451
01:02:07,446 --> 01:02:08,404
<b>Marta.</b>

452
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:11,904
<b>You know about this more than me.</b>

453
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,279
<b>I need your help.</b>

454
01:02:14,946 --> 01:02:15,904
<b>Please!</b>

455
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:26,029
<b>Where's Gadis?</b>

456
01:02:29,862 --> 01:02:30,862
<b>She was with us.</b>

457
01:02:33,112 --> 01:02:34,779
<b>Best we stick together from now.</b>

458
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:51,696
<b>Always poor old me..</b>

459
01:02:53,362 --> 01:02:54,196
<b>Dis..</b>

460
01:02:56,404 --> 01:02:57,487
<b>Gadis.</b>

461
01:03:06,737 --> 01:03:08,029
<b>Are these spells?</b>

462
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:09,571
<b>More than that, Alfie.</b>

463
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:11,487
<b>From what I've researched,</b>

464
01:03:11,779 --> 01:03:14,237
<b>This Bible has been used by a number of people.</b>

465
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:17,237
<b>To summon things.</b>

466
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:22,279
<b>Things beyond comprehension of logic.</b>

467
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:28,029
<b>Marta, you should not be messing with these.</b>

468
01:03:31,196 --> 01:03:32,029
<b>Dis,</b>

469
01:03:33,821 --> 01:03:34,737
<b>Gadis.</b>

470
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:37,237
<b>I'm tired!</b>

471
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:51,487
<b>Shit, what a mess.</b>

472
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:54,154
<b>Should've been a homeless kid instead.</b>

473
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:19,321
<b>What's wrong, Alfie?</b>

474
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:45,987
<b>What is this?</b>

475
01:04:49,446 --> 01:04:52,862
<b>Fuck, you fuckin' weirdo.</b>

476
01:04:54,737 --> 01:04:56,154
<b>Who's a weirdo?</b>

477
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:01,112
<b>Gadis!</b>

478
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:05,321
<b>Gadis!</b>

479
01:05:05,654 --> 01:05:06,987
<b>Open the door!</b>

480
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:14,237
<b>Leo, always putting up a fight..</b>

481
01:05:14,529 --> 01:05:16,487
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>

482
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:20,654
<b>Father Ayub says you're punished, Leo.</b>

483
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:24,904
<b>What do you mean?</b>

484
01:05:25,779 --> 01:05:27,779
<b>Just like when we were kids.</b>

485
01:05:31,071 --> 01:05:32,029
<b>Let's see now.</b>

486
01:05:32,571 --> 01:05:34,029
<b>How long will you last?</b>

487
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,321
<b>Let me out of here Gadis!</b>

488
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:43,571
<b>Gadis!</b>

489
01:05:43,779 --> 01:05:44,696
<b>Budi!</b>

490
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:53,612
<b>This is Gadis right? Sitting on Ayub's lap.</b>

491
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:56,112
<b>It is..</b>

492
01:05:56,529 --> 01:05:59,862
<b>Do you know what Stockholm Syndrome means?</b>

493
01:06:04,529 --> 01:06:05,779
<b>Look at their hands.</b>

494
01:06:21,154 --> 01:06:22,862
<b>Sir!</b>

495
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:25,821
<b>Open the door, Sir!</b>

496
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:28,362
<b>Sir Ayub!</b>

497
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:36,321
<b>We'll die here.</b>

498
01:06:36,737 --> 01:06:37,987
<b>It can't be..</b>

499
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:40,571
<b>Sir Ayub will never let us out.</b>

500
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,987
<b>No! Impossible!</b>

501
01:06:56,821 --> 01:06:59,237
<b>Bud!? Budi?!</b>

502
01:07:00,821 --> 01:07:01,821
<b>Bud?</b>

503
01:07:02,237 --> 01:07:03,237
<b>Son of a bitch!</b>

504
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:28,112
<b>Marta!</b>

505
01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:31,529
<b>That spell has ressurected Ayub.</b>

506
01:09:31,987 --> 01:09:34,279
<b>- Am I right?!</b>
<b>- Alfie!</b>

507
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:36,279
<b>- Marta, answer me!</b>
<b>- Alfie</b>

508
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,362
<b>Leo? Leo?</b>

509
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:06,154
<b>Leo is with me, Budi. You'll follow him soon..</b>

510
01:10:15,987 --> 01:10:17,862
<b>Budi, help me. Come on!</b>

511
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:21,612
<b>Gadis!</b>

512
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:24,321
<b>Gadis, open the door!</b>

513
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:28,529
<b>Gadis!</b>

514
01:10:48,487 --> 01:10:50,446
<b>Oh, my father.</b>

515
01:10:51,987 --> 01:10:53,612
<b>I am ready.</b>

516
01:10:54,821 --> 01:10:56,904
<b>To be in your servitude</b>

517
01:10:57,196 --> 01:11:01,279
<b>As you are to 'him'.</b>

518
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:08,196
<b>I am ready, Father.</b>

519
01:11:24,696 --> 01:11:27,821
<b>I am ready.</b>

520
01:11:45,696 --> 01:11:48,029
<b>My child.</b>

521
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:52,612
<b>I am ready, Father.</b>

522
01:11:58,821 --> 01:12:00,529
<b>I am ready, Father.</b>

523
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:04,362
<b>I am ready! I am ready, Father.</b>

524
01:12:19,904 --> 01:12:20,821
<b>Gadis?</b>

525
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:22,071
<b>Gadis.</b>

526
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:24,612
<b>Budi!</b>

527
01:12:28,946 --> 01:12:30,571
<b>Gadis, what are you doing?</b>

528
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,529
<b>Budi, don't!</b>

529
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:35,487
<b>You'll be joining Leo, Budi.</b>

530
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,571
<b>All shall be together again.</b>

531
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:41,446
<b>What have you done to Leo, Gadis?</b>

532
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:44,362
<b>Why?</b>

533
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,696
<b>- You're our sister</b>
<b>- Shut up, Budi.</b>

534
01:12:49,154 --> 01:12:50,446
<b>You're all blind.</b>

535
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:53,071
<b>Blind towards his greatness.</b>

536
01:12:53,654 --> 01:12:55,487
<b>What awaits us beyond these..</b>

537
01:12:57,154 --> 01:12:58,779
<b>You never believed it, right?</b>

538
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:02,987
<b>Father loved all of us.</b>

539
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:07,362
<b>- You're insane!</b>
<b>- He begs Moloch so we can be unified.</b>

540
01:13:07,862 --> 01:13:08,987
<b>Forever.</b>

541
01:13:09,404 --> 01:13:11,029
<b>Yet, you all killed Father.</b>

542
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:13,362
<b>We all loved you!</b>

543
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,071
<b>Dewi died for you!</b>

544
01:13:18,404 --> 01:13:19,612
<b>Dewi..</b>

545
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,987
<b>I'm staying over tonight.</b>

546
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:28,112
<b>She always wanted to be the hero.</b>

547
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:34,946
<b>After studying the spells over and over again.</b>

548
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:38,487
<b>I was finally able to summon Father.</b>

549
01:13:39,154 --> 01:13:42,237
<b>Even if only for a moment.</b>

550
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:43,737
<b>Father Ayub cares for me</b>

551
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:46,404
<b>He showed Dewi,</b>

552
01:13:48,321 --> 01:13:51,071
<b>her soul belongs to him.</b>

553
01:13:54,404 --> 01:13:58,321
<b>But to permanently resurrect Ayub,</b>

554
01:13:58,696 --> 01:14:02,612
<b>she needed someone who has ties with something even</b>
<b>stronger.</b>

555
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,237
<b>And that person is me.</b>

556
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:06,112
<b>Right?</b>

557
01:14:15,946 --> 01:14:17,362
<b>Correct, Alfie.</b>

558
01:14:18,612 --> 01:14:20,696
<b>This was all destined.</b>

559
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:25,321
<b>You know how fortunate you are?</b>

560
01:14:27,112 --> 01:14:29,654
<b>To be chosen by the great one.</b>

561
01:14:31,487 --> 01:14:32,362
<b>Gadis!</b>

562
01:14:43,362 --> 01:14:46,529
<b>On your knees Budi. Now!</b>

563
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:49,446
<b>Before it's too late for you.</b>

564
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:51,446
<b>To hell with you and Ayub!</b>

565
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,529
<b>Fuck your spells!</b>

566
01:15:05,362 --> 01:15:07,362
<b>Budi!</b>

567
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:10,612
<b>- Budi!</b>
<b>- Gadis!</b>

568
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:15,112
<b>Look!</b>

569
01:15:19,987 --> 01:15:20,987
<b>Budi!</b>

570
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:24,821
<b>Gadis, stop!</b>

571
01:15:30,737 --> 01:15:31,404
<b>Gadis!</b>

572
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:39,321
<b>Budi!</b>

573
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:44,487
<b>Budi?</b>

574
01:16:07,404 --> 01:16:08,571
<b>You bitch!</b>

575
01:16:09,112 --> 01:16:10,779
<b>Fucking deranged bitch!</b>

576
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:15,696
<b>Just so you know..</b>

577
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,946
<b>I survived something much stronger than Ayub.</b>

578
01:16:20,987 --> 01:16:22,779
<b>Your spells are useless against me.</b>

579
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,446
<b>Alfie, watch out!</b>

580
01:16:45,446 --> 01:16:47,696
<b>Nara, you hurry run! Run!</b>

581
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:52,237
<b>That child belongs to Father Ayub.</b>

582
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:54,529
<b>Enough, I want all these to be over. Please!</b>

583
01:16:54,612 --> 01:16:55,487
<b>Marta!</b>

584
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,321
<b>You lied to me, Gadis.</b>

585
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:00,987
<b>You said this will make our lives happier.</b>

586
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:02,654
<b>I'm happy, am I not?</b>

587
01:17:04,279 --> 01:17:07,404
<b>Father Ayub opened the way for both of us.</b>

588
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:10,029
<b>You remember, right?</b>

589
01:17:10,362 --> 01:17:11,904
<b>Let's go upstairs.</b>

590
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:31,946
<b>Marta!</b>

591
01:17:32,362 --> 01:17:34,154
<b>Marta, don't listen to her!</b>

592
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:35,904
<b>Marta!</b>

593
01:17:57,946 --> 01:17:59,154
<b>Marta!</b>

594
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:09,571
<b>Remember?</b>

595
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,237
<b>How I loved brushing your hair.</b>

596
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:20,071
<b>After all these,</b>

597
01:18:21,946 --> 01:18:23,987
<b>we'll be together again.</b>

598
01:18:25,696 --> 01:18:29,862
<b>Yes, we'll be together in hell.</b>

599
01:18:49,112 --> 01:18:50,946
<b>If you truly survived the devil,</b>

600
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:53,279
<b>this should be nothing for you, Alfie</b>

601
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,154
<b>Marta! Snap out of it!</b>

602
01:19:20,404 --> 01:19:23,946
<b>- Marta!</b>
<b>- I'm Sorry.</b>

603
01:19:28,946 --> 01:19:37,696
<b>Use this Bible. To stop Gadis. Stop Ayub.</b>

604
01:19:38,029 --> 01:19:39,904
<b>But I don't know how.</b>

605
01:19:52,862 --> 01:19:54,362
<b>You're chosen, Alfie.</b>

606
01:19:55,904 --> 01:20:01,821
<b>Find the symbols. Read the spells.</b>

607
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:10,654
<b>Marta! Marta!</b>

608
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:45,612
<b>Hello, Nara.</b>

609
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,487
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

610
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:13,571
<b>Nara.</b>

611
01:21:18,904 --> 01:21:22,279
<b>You're a feisty one eh, Nara?</b>

612
01:23:02,404 --> 01:23:06,279
<b>Get up, Budi!</b>

613
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:08,321
<b>Hurry! Come on, hurry!</b>

614
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,446
<b>Marta!</b>

615
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:21,612
<b>We have to get out of here. Now!</b>

616
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:33,946
<b>Careful!</b>

617
01:23:39,696 --> 01:23:41,946
<b>Don't move.</b>

618
01:23:43,696 --> 01:23:45,237
<b>Its all over.</b>

619
01:23:45,862 --> 01:23:47,696
<b>My friends, they're all dead.</b>

620
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:49,696
<b>Yet you're still here, alive!</b>

621
01:23:50,529 --> 01:23:52,571
<b>Trust me, Budi!</b>

622
01:23:52,696 --> 01:23:53,696
<b>Trust me!</b>

623
01:23:54,487 --> 01:24:00,279
<b>I have to find Nara. You fix the car, okay?</b>

624
01:24:06,237 --> 01:24:07,571
<b>Please..don't die!</b>

625
01:24:08,737 --> 01:24:10,821
<b>- Please!</b>
<b>- I will try.</b>

626
01:24:57,029 --> 01:24:59,821
<b>Help me, Alfie!</b>

627
01:24:59,987 --> 01:25:00,946
<b>Nara?</b>

628
01:25:04,071 --> 01:25:05,029
<b>Nara?</b>

629
01:25:36,946 --> 01:25:37,821
<b>Moloch..</b>

630
01:25:49,446 --> 01:25:53,529
<b>You're in my world now, Alfie.</b>

631
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:46,071
<b>Nara?</b>

632
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,737
<b>This is not real.</b>

633
01:27:15,821 --> 01:27:16,904
<b>Alfie!</b>

634
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,029
<b>Leo?</b>

635
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:22,487
<b>This is a dream, right?!</b>

636
01:27:24,487 --> 01:27:25,362
<b>Alfie!</b>

637
01:27:25,821 --> 01:27:27,529
<b>A dream, right?!</b>

638
01:27:27,904 --> 01:27:28,946
<b>Alfie!</b>

639
01:27:48,112 --> 01:27:49,446
<b>Kristi?</b>

640
01:27:51,987 --> 01:27:53,279
<b>Jenar?</b>

641
01:27:54,071 --> 01:27:57,987
<b>Did you see a girl..your age?</b>

642
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,237
<b>Alfie!</b>

643
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:06,404
<b>Nara?</b>

644
01:28:06,529 --> 01:28:07,987
<b>Get out of there!</b>

645
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,612
<b>- Nara?</b>
<b>- Alfie, I'm sorry.</b>

646
01:29:04,696 --> 01:29:06,321
<b>You didn't do anything wrong.</b>

647
01:29:07,737 --> 01:29:08,946
<b>Marta, she..</b>

648
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:12,029
<b>Marta wants you to be save.</b>

649
01:29:12,904 --> 01:29:13,696
<b>Alfie!</b>

650
01:29:20,487 --> 01:29:22,237
<b>We have to go now. Hurry!</b>

651
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:23,904
<b>Go! Hurry!</b>

652
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:29,446
<b>Let's go, Nara!</b>

653
01:29:30,196 --> 01:29:31,071
<b>Alfie!</b>

654
01:29:32,737 --> 01:29:33,987
<b>Alfie!</b>

655
01:30:02,987 --> 01:30:04,904
<b>Nara!</b>

656
01:30:05,446 --> 01:30:08,654
<b>- Nara! You go. Go!</b>
<b>- Let's go, Alfie!</b>

657
01:30:12,196 --> 01:30:13,612
<b>Alfie!</b>

658
01:30:15,237 --> 01:30:17,237
<b>You belong to him now..</b>

659
01:30:18,529 --> 01:30:21,987
<b>Ayub! I'm not afraid of you!</b>

660
01:30:28,612 --> 01:30:29,487
<b>Gadis..</b>

661
01:30:44,487 --> 01:30:46,862
<b>This won't work, Alfie.</b>

662
01:30:48,487 --> 01:30:51,987
<b>If you don't know how to use it.</b>

663
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:59,487
<b>Still, you're the perfect offering for Father.</b>

664
01:31:53,487 --> 01:31:54,821
<b>Alfie! Get up!</b>

665
01:31:55,071 --> 01:31:56,237
<b>Nara?</b>

666
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,696
<b>Alfie, you naive silly girl.</b>

667
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:14,404
<b>I can possess anyone!</b>

668
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:16,446
<b>Please..one last time..</b>

669
01:32:16,487 --> 01:32:20,321
<b>Shatter you bones. Shred your flesh.</b>

670
01:32:21,029 --> 01:32:24,362
<b>On my signal, you run straight to the ladder.</b>

671
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:25,904
<b>But we have to stick together.</b>

672
01:32:25,946 --> 01:32:29,404
<b>Nara, you need to trust me, please!</b>

673
01:32:31,904 --> 01:32:36,029
<b>Once I separate your soul from your flesh,</b>

674
01:32:36,654 --> 01:32:40,362
<b>You'll be the ultimate offering for him.</b>

675
01:32:43,821 --> 01:32:47,904
<b>Then, we can be forever together, Alfie.</b>

676
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:54,071
<b>Just like sisters..</b>

677
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:09,904
<b>Gadis!</b>

678
01:33:52,779 --> 01:33:56,279
<b>Satani Levitas, you fuckin ghoul!</b>

679
01:34:35,571 --> 01:34:36,862
<b>Alfie!</b>

<b>Alfie, hurry!</b>

681
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:52,112
<b>Alfie!</b>

682
01:34:57,362 --> 01:34:59,862
<b>It's all over, Alfie.</b>

683
01:35:06,154 --> 01:35:08,321
<b>Alfie, move away!</b>

684
01:35:20,529 --> 01:35:22,779
<b>Budi! Budi!</b>

685
01:35:29,321 --> 01:35:30,821
<b>You both okay?</b>

686
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:45,446
<b>Budi, don't!</b>

687
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:14,071
<b>Father!</b>

688
01:36:14,904 --> 01:36:18,112
<b>Father don't leave me, please.</b>

689
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:41,237
<b>- Gadis?</b>
<b>- Don't!</b>

690
01:37:17,779 --> 01:37:20,487
<b>Alfie, move!</b>

691
01:37:27,862 --> 01:37:28,737
<b>Sister!</b>

692
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:30,029
<b>Nara!</b>

693
01:37:32,237 --> 01:37:35,196
<b>Ayub, over here! Bastard!</b>

694
01:37:35,946 --> 01:37:37,237
<b>Insolent!</b>

695
01:37:51,654 --> 01:37:55,154
<b>Alfie? Are you okay?</b>

696
01:38:01,946 --> 01:38:05,946
<b>We survived the devil. Remember, Nara?</b>

697
01:38:06,446 --> 01:38:07,279
<b>Alfie!</b>

698
01:38:33,029 --> 01:38:37,321
<b>Alfie, don't! No!</b>

<b>- Alfie, don't!</b>
<b>- I love you, Nara.</b>

700
01:38:43,612 --> 01:38:44,904
<b>Alfie, don't!</b>

701
01:39:13,696 --> 01:39:19,237
<b>Alfie, wake up! Please wake up!</b>

702
01:40:11,779 --> 01:40:14,737
<b>Child, do you know where you are?</b>

703
01:40:14,779 --> 01:40:17,987
<b>You.. You're Moloch?</b>

704
01:40:18,071 --> 01:40:22,821
<b>Do you know where you are?</b>

705
01:40:22,904 --> 01:40:24,237
<b>What is this?</b>

706
01:40:24,737 --> 01:40:29,571
<b>You know what this is, the question is..</b>

707
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:32,571
<b>Are you ready?</b>

708
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:38,196
<b>Ayub. Where is he?</b>

709
01:40:49,112 --> 01:40:53,196
<b>In eternal damnation.</b>

710
01:41:05,362 --> 01:41:06,571
<b>Come on then!</b>

711
01:41:09,487 --> 01:41:10,904
<b>Do it!</b>

712
01:41:17,737 --> 01:41:24,612
<b>Are you so foolish, to escape from your own destiny,</b>

713
01:41:26,112 --> 01:41:30,779
<b>even after losing so much.</b>

714
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:33,654
<b>Even after everything?</b>

715
01:41:33,737 --> 01:41:37,904
<b>Even after everything?</b>

716
01:41:38,154 --> 01:41:42,696
<b>You choose to selfishly extinguish your own life.</b>

717
01:41:42,737 --> 01:41:46,154
<b>As if your soul belongs to you.</b>

718
01:41:46,196 --> 01:41:49,446
<b>As if your soul belongs to only you.</b>

719
01:41:49,529 --> 01:41:51,487
<b>No!</b>

720
01:41:51,571 --> 01:41:54,112
<b>No!</b>

721
01:41:57,029 --> 01:42:04,071
<b>Your filthy soul has been mine since you were but a child.</b>

722
01:42:06,404 --> 01:42:10,446
<b>Only I shall claim it!</b>

723
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:15,112
<b>Your soul belongs to Moloch!</b>

724
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:41,654
<b>Alfie..</b>

725
01:43:38,904 --> 01:43:41,237
<b>Alfie, let's go.</b>

726
01:44:12,529 --> 01:44:13,362
<b>Budi.</b>

727
01:44:15,612 --> 01:44:17,696
<b>Now you can start to find a decent job.</b>

728
01:44:19,196 --> 01:44:22,737
<b>So, you can buy a nicer car. Okay?</b>

729
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:29,821
<b>Anyway, do we still need this?</b>

730
01:44:31,071 --> 01:44:32,404
<b>Or is it too dangerous?</b>

731
01:44:34,737 --> 01:44:37,696
<b>Dangerous? What's that?</b>

732
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:44,487
<b>Nara, seat belt please.</b>
