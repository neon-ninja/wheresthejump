1
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:47,514
Put that away.

2
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:49,724
Well done.

3
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:53,980
Not as good as last time, but good.
Colleen ...

4
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,067
- Don't forget, those of you who 
haven't completed your tally charts.

5
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,152
Moron.

6
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:02,488
Quiet!

7
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:05,450
- Anna Madden, out!
- But it wasn't me.

8
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,953
- Out!
- Sharon took my exercise book.

9
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:10,789
- Liar!
- Out now or you're on detention.

10
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,292
- But it was Sharon.
- Out!

11
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,585
No.

12
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,879
- Right, I'll see you after school.

13
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:25,847
And wait where I can see you.

14
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:33,022
Nigel, did I tell you to stand up?
No, so get back in your seat.

15
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:38,402
Now, we all know how many degress there
are in a circle, don't we Nigel.

16
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:43,032
Quit! The next person 
to laugh joins her.

17
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:47,704
Right, we're starting something
new today. Another way of showing

18
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:49,581
basic statistics.

19
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:52,667
Pie charts.

20
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,297
Now a pie chart is just another way of
showing information.

21
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,510
Take for example the information we
took last week.

22
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:04,639
Now what was the most common number of
letters in all your surnames?

23
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,723
Seven.

24
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:10,103
About half of you have seven letters
in your surnames. So ...

25
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:13,315
what portion of the pie do
those people have?

26
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,025
Half.

27
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,986
180-degree slice of the pie.

28
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,115
Now I'm going to make up
a different pie chart

29
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,741
with a different set of information.

30
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:26,329
How we spend our day.

31
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,875
I'll do an example for you based
on my average weekday

32
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:36,131
then I want you to make up a pie chart
based on your average Saturday.

33
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:40,469
First, I write down my information.

34
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,596
What are the things I do?

35
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:46,434
Getting dressed and undressed.

36
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:49,478
Eating.

37
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,774
Travelling.

38
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,652
School.

39
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:58,697
Meeting friends.

40
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:03,369
What?

41
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,706
- I feel dizzy.
- She's lying!

42
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,542
- I want to go home.
- She's lying, Miss!

43
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,754
I'm not!
-Well you don't sound ill to me.

44
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:17,926
If you disturb us again you're going
straight to Mr. Murphy. Understand?

45
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,303
But it's my birthday.

46
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:21,513
Well you should have thought
of that before.

47
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,099
Quiet.

48
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:28,353
And you can wipe that look off
your face, Sharon Davis.

49
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,356
Where were we?

50
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,859
Sleeping. Right.

51
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:36,112
I spend one hour dressing
and undressing.

52
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:38,281
About two and a half hours eating.

53
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,286
About 8 hours at school.

54
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:21,870
She passed out.

55
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,124
- Is she gonna die?
- Trisham, go get matron.

56
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,218
Thanks.

57
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,803
Hi.

58
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:38,972
How are you feeling?

59
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:41,391
- Terrible, mum.
- That bad, eh?

60
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,475
Worse.

61
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:47,148
- Oh, but I'm sure it's nothing serious.
- I wish they hadn't called you.

62
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:49,900
- I could have gone home by myself.
- Don't worry.

63
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,320
Things were so busy at work that it
was really nice to get out of there.

64
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,198
Listen, this'll cheer you up.

65
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:58,868
It came after you left.
Guess who it's from?

66
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,289
- Dad.
- Yeah.

67
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,722
Happy 11th birthday.
Lots of love, Dad.

68
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:21,851
Well, that's not all. There's something
very special fixed up for you.

69
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:24,771
- What?
- No, it's a surprise.

70
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,690
Riding lessons?

71
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,276
Yeah, some surprise.

72
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,032
Where's Mogadishu? -I think it's a
port on the east coast of Africa.

73
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,868
Well they spelled my name wrong.
-Did they?

74
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:41,331
Oh ... it's just a mistake.

75
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,003
- Maybe I could send a reply.
- That's a nice idea.

76
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,430
- I wish dad was here.
- So do I.

77
00:07:56,847 --> 00:08:01,393
- When's he coming back?
- Soon.

78
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:06,024
How are you feeling now?

79
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:10,987
- No worse. When is the riding lesson?
- It was meant to be after school today.

80
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:13,198
Meant to be?

81
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,575
Let's see what
Dr. Nicols says first.

82
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:19,497
Do we have to? I'm sure if I just lay
down in front of the telly I'll be OK.

83
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:22,083
Doctor first.
No arguing, okay?

84
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:30,508
Stop!
Stop it!

85
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:34,054
- I was pretending.
- Pretending?

86
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,723
Sharon Davis stole my book.

87
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:39,560
Then I pushed her off the chair and
Miss Vanstone put me on detention.

88
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,480
I can't be on detention on my
birthday, can I? So I faked it.

89
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,191
You faked it?

90
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,735
So you're not ill?

91
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,492
- Where are we going?
- Back.

92
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,286
- I can't go back.
- Oh, you're going back.

93
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,497
- I'll look stupid.
- Well you do already.

94
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,583
Stupid cow.

95
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,627
Just because it's your birthday don't
think you can talk to me like that.

96
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,422
You should be pleased
there's nothing wrong with me.

97
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:10,134
You're telling too many lies, Anna,
and it is going to stop.

98
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,847
- What about my riding lesson?
- Oh, don't ask.

99
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:17,851
We'll see.

100
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:22,147
- What does that mean?
- It means we'll see.

101
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,574
I hate you.

102
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:44,797
Karen.

103
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:48,759
Come here.

104
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,055
- I was wondering where you got to.
- Shh ...

105
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,224
Got the afternoon off.

106
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:58,436
I'm having a really
miserable birthday.

107
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:04,860
- You been using the sunlamp again?
- No, my skin just tans very fast ...

108
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,070
naturally.

109
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,740
I don't get brown;
I get sunstroke.

110
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,326
Last year I fell asleep in a
deck chair on my dad's oil rig,

111
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:16,748
and when I woke up I was
burnt to a frazzle.

112
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:22,212
- Why's your mum so angry with you?
- 'Cause she's a cow.

113
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:26,091
What was Gary's
party like then?

114
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,303
Lots of snogging. Not much
else I can remember, really.

115
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:33,307
- You had a nice time then?
- I suppose you could call it that.

116
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:37,937
First I was upstairs with Nigel,
then on the sofa with Ronnie ...

117
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,733
then Vaughn Hancock, pissed out of
his head, got me on the thick pile.

118
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,279
You're lucky you haven't
started that yet.

119
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,072
What's snogging like then?

120
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:49,950
Well, like kissing a vacuum cleaner.

121
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,797
This looks a real skill
place to play hide-and-seek.

122
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:06,676
- I'm too old for that kind of thing.
- Bet you 50p you can't find me.

123
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:08,137
- A quid.
- You're on.

124
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:11,932
Close your eyes, count to 100,
and don't peek.

125
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:16,812
1, 2, 3, 4 ...

126
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:05,281
86, 87, 88 ...

127
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,840
99, 100. I'm coming!

128
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:38,173
Is anybody there?

129
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:42,511
Karen!

130
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:14,796
It's her.

131
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:37,654
Anna.

132
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:43,410
Don't ever do that to me again.
Never! What has got into you?

133
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,745
Mum, I don't feel very well.

134
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,294
Now open wide.

135
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:41,138
My throat hurts ...
like I've swallowed dust.

136
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:48,021
Gritty ... and it aches,
but that's all.

137
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,981
You sure that's all?

138
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:53,944
No fainting fits?
No dizziness?

139
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:56,989
And this ache,
is it just in your throat?

140
00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:01,285
You've obviously had quite
an eventful birthday.

141
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:04,497
- I suppose you could call it that.
- Sorry to drag you out like this ...

142
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,124
but I was worried.

143
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:07,918
I don't blame you.

144
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:09,711
Look, I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

145
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,631
She should have a
couple of days rest.

146
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,800
What I don't understand is
what happened in the tunnel?

147
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,469
Anna.

148
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,978
What happened
in the tunnel?

149
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:27,147
Fell asleep and lost track
of time. You know....

150
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:33,111
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I'll have that throat swab analyzed.

151
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:36,198
And you're obviously running
quite a temperature.

152
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:39,451
- And I think a day or two in bed ...
- When it goes down can I go riding?

153
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:42,997
- You must rest for a couple of days.
- I'm not staying in bed.

154
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:43,831
Don't.

155
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,791
Well, think of it this way:
if you rest now you'll get better

156
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:50,046
sooner. You rush around, who
knows how long it might take.

157
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,674
How long exactly do
I have to stay in bed?

158
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:54,217
I'll come and see you again
at the end of the week.

159
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:57,387
- The end of the week?
- Count yourself lucky.

160
00:16:57,387 --> 00:17:00,892
I've got a patient a little bit older
than you whose been in bed for a year.

161
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:02,768
I'd rather die than that.

162
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,771
You and he would get on well.

163
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,025
No we wouldn't: I hate boys.

164
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:14,114
- I'll see you on Friday then.
- Goodnight Sarah

165
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,909
Here Sarah, I'll show you out.

166
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:20,537
Is there someone who can come and look
after Anna whilst you're at work?

167
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:21,914
No.

168
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:24,791
- I'll have to take some time off.
- You okay?

169
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:29,297
Yeah. I could do with
a break, that's all.

170
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:30,799
Tired?

171
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,883
Yeah.

172
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:36,971
It's always difficult when
John's away, and I just ...

173
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,851
I don't know....

174
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,228
Too sad.

175
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,925
Is anybody there?

176
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:23,188
Is anybody there?

177
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:34,993
Can I come in?

178
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:40,081
I can't hear you.

179
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,843
- I said go away.
- No, you let me in, then I'll go away.

180
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:53,429
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

181
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,515
'Cause there aren't
any stairs.

182
00:18:56,515 --> 00:19:00,979
- How did you get up there then?
- I don't know. I'm just here.

183
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:06,109
Can't you tell someone else to let
me in? -There isn't anyone else.

184
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,156
Look, just stop mucking
around and let me in.

185
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:14,494
Go away, don't you understand,
it's dangerous around here, dangerous.

186
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,306
It's real.

187
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:38,486
There are stairs.

188
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,910
- You were wrong about the stairs.
- Must have come since.

189
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:46,870
Since I drew them.

190
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,499
You shouldn't be here.

191
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:54,169
I knew I should've
made you more cheerful.

192
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,966
I drew you, this house,
the stairs, everything.

193
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:00,552
Come and have a look, come on.

194
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:03,096
I can't walk.

195
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:09,018
Of course, I didn't draw you any legs.

196
00:24:13,357 --> 00:24:14,567
I'm not a drawing!

197
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:24,911
I'm sorry, I just drew someone
at the window, that's all.

198
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:27,914
It's alright.

199
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,586
My name's Mark, what's yours?

200
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,633
Mark!

201
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:04,412
Mum?

202
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:10,210
And one, and two, and three...

203
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:20,638
- Mum?
- What?

204
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,933
- Mum?
- Go away please.

205
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,768
- What's wrong mum?

206
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,525
Nothing, I just don't
want you ruining this print.

207
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,616
- Feeling better?
- No, worse.

208
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:44,205
What photo are you doing?

209
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:48,334
The one you took on
the beach last summer.

210
00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:01,265
I'm having dreams mum, but
they're real, I know they are.

211
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,517
Dreams can't be real sweetie.

212
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:10,108
It's dad!

213
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:14,737
They might frighten you
but they can never hurt you.

214
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:19,450
- How do you know? - Because if
they could they wouldn't be dreams.

215
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:29,503
- No, leave it, I like the
clouds dark. - Alright, darling.

216
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,267
Oh that's too much.

217
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,272
Come on, we're gonna get you to bed.

218
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:51,444
- No, i'll be alright if I stay awake.
- No, come on, come on right now.

219
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:41,623
On the other side of
the hill is the sea.

220
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,557
It shines out for miles and
miles and everyone can see it.

221
00:28:10,362 --> 00:28:12,072
It looks like glandular fever.

222
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:17,620
I lied to you about the fainting,
it's happened several times.

223
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:20,206
I guessed you weren't
telling the truth.

224
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:27,797
That's all though,
you didn't need to come.

225
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:31,802
- I'm getting much better.
- Your mother was right to call me.

226
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:37,141
- Is it bad? - Well, it'll
knock you out for a few weeks.

227
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,274
Your pulse is right up.

228
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:47,944
So are these glands.

229
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:00,166
- What have you been upto in here?
- Nothing.

230
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:06,339
- When did you last faint.
- After I saw you, yesterday.

231
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:07,632
I see.

232
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:12,554
Sarah?

233
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,017
- You know this boy you see?
- Yes.

234
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:19,853
When's he going to be able to get up?

235
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:24,901
Well, he can get up, he just doesn't
want to most of the time, that's all.

236
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,903
He's getting better though?

237
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:32,200
You're really interested
in my other patients Anna?

238
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:36,121
- Doesn't he want to get better?
- Well of course he does.

239
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:38,874
Then why doesn't he get out of bed?

240
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:42,461
As long as he gets enough books to
read he's content to stay in bed.

241
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,257
That's terrible, I
can't stand staying in bed.

242
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:48,927
If you told me I could
get up tomorrow i'd be up.

243
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:52,055
Well it isn't just a question
of getting up, it's just that...

244
00:29:52,764 --> 00:29:55,225
Exercise is too much
bother and pain for Mark.

245
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:00,772
- Mark, can't walk?
- No.

246
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:06,696
What wrong Anna?

247
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:17,499
We're just opposites
me and him, aren't we?

248
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:23,297
He's got to do exercise
and doesn't want to...

249
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:26,758
and i've got to stay in
bed and I don't want to.

250
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:30,263
It's a pity you
can't mix us up a bit.

251
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,852
Well I dare say you two are
each better off as you are.

252
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:40,983
I'll have a word with
Kate on my way out.

253
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:44,737
Bye Anna.

254
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:15,811
Now he'll walk.

255
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,410
Mark!

256
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,706
Mark!

257
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:42,382
Mark?

258
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:11,329
Oh, no cones.

259
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:18,880
Hi.

260
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:25,012
Whoever left this
should've left some instructions.

261
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,765
It seems to be based on the
Apple design, it's a bit crude.

262
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:31,852
I'll fix that tomorrow.

263
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:36,189
I suppose you'll tell me you drew it,
that would explain why it's so mental.

264
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:43,990
You've been moving things around.

265
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,745
My name's Anna.

266
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,215
- I drew you walking but it went wrong.
- I don't undertstand you.

267
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,477
- You like reading don't you?
- Yeah.

268
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,239
- Then you are Mark?
- Well i'm not a drawing, I know that.

269
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:24,116
I've got the same doctor
as you, Dr Nichols.

270
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:25,284
Not me.

271
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:32,084
- I mean... when you're not here.
- Look, i'm always here.

272
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:36,088
- They left me here.
- Who left you here?

273
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:47,767
It's great, isn't it?

274
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:52,188
Do you want some fruit?
It's really good for you.

275
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:53,982
Ok.

276
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:49,709
Behind you!

277
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:54,756
Very funny.

278
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:02,014
Very funny, I could've broken
my leg, you're so stupid.

279
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:19,199
There was this boy...

280
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,452
about my age...

281
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:26,831
he had a bike, a blue one...

282
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,710
it was in perfect nick.

283
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:35,091
Although he loved this bike,
he couldn't ride it.

284
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:41,306
He'd just watch it every day and having
it there made all the difference.

285
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:47,187
But one day he'd ride it and that
was all that ever mattered to him.

286
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,279
Why are you here Mark?

287
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:02,328
I did something wrong,
I expect that's why you're here too.

288
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:05,039
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- Oh I bet!

289
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,418
But I haven't done anything wrong.

290
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:11,505
Maybe all this stuff's here for you
and you're to stay here like me.

291
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,216
No chance, this is a dream.

292
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,428
That's what I thought.

293
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:22,225
Do you think whoever brought you
here will come back again?

294
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,060
I hope not.

295
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,274
If my dad was here
he could carry you...

296
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:33,946
and you could run away
with us, then you'd be safe.

297
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:36,115
And you wouldn't be afraid any more.

298
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,156
He looks like a madman.

299
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:21,538
Hello darling.

300
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,636
- What's that?
- A radio.

301
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:39,058
- It doesn't look like a radio,
it's too big. - It's a radio.

302
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:52,447
Who's that?

303
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,201
That's dad, that's good.

304
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,624
I think he looks drunk,
I hate it when he's drunk.

305
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,252
He stopped drinking years ago.

306
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,922
He was drunk when
I took that picture.

307
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:12,302
- Why don't you have your soup.
- He was, wasn't he?

308
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:14,846
Let me see.

309
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:22,146
Well, a bit, maybe.

310
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:26,525
You could rub it out and try again.

311
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:31,281
- I can't.
- It's almost right, it's just...

312
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:34,826
His head's a bit too big
and he looks sort of angry.

313
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:38,747
What is it?

314
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:43,169
Why don't you go back to work, I
don't like you hanging around here.

315
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:47,089
- I'll be alright. - Listen,
it's good, it's really good.

316
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:53,971
- It's total rubbish!
- It's only a drawing Anna, come on.

317
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:57,517
That's right, it's only a drawing.

318
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:01,939
I think it's good, I really do.

319
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:07,361
It's just that i'm
having those dreams again...

320
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,616
and i'm frightened dad's going to come
into those dreams looking like that.

321
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,662
Listen, if dad came into your
dreams that would be nice.

322
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:18,498
And no drawing is going
to make any difference.

323
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,587
- Have I done anything wrong?
- Do you ever do anything right?

324
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:26,090
I must've done something really bad.

325
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:29,093
It's nothing you've done,
that's silly, don't think that.

326
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,762
- Then why don't you believe me?
- Believe what?

327
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:34,306
That my dreams are frightening me.

328
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,143
- I do believe you.
- No you don't.

329
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:38,311
Listen...

330
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:44,901
I know it's hard for you with
dad away all the time but...

331
00:39:46,027 --> 00:39:50,324
It's hard for me too, we've
got to try to get on better.

332
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:57,206
- Will you promise me something?
- What?

333
00:39:58,082 --> 00:40:02,963
You've got to be honest with me about
when you pass out and when you...

334
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,135
see things that maybe
I don't see, you understand?

335
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:11,722
It's really important
Anna, you have to promise.

336
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:14,934
I always tell you the truth.

337
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:24,944
A nice hot bath and then to bed.

338
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:51,913
Mum!

339
00:41:54,374 --> 00:41:54,958
Mum!

340
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:09,390
- I don't feel well. - I know, I know,
you try and get some sleep, ok?

341
00:42:11,518 --> 00:42:14,521
- My head hurts. - I know
but I have to dry your hair.

342
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:26,284
There, just a bit more.

343
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,454
Ok.

344
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:43,427
- Will you set my alarm for me? - Why,
are you going somewhere special tomorrow?

345
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,849
- Set it for 7.
- Ok.

346
00:42:59,152 --> 00:43:00,403
I'll just get your teddy.

347
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:13,292
Stay with me until I get to sleep,
I don't wanna be on my own.

348
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:14,919
Sure.

349
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:20,676
I'll just be a second, I just have
to get something from my room.

350
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:56,214
No dreams.

351
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:11,772
- That was quick.
- I'm late.

352
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:14,775
Is something the matter?

353
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,112
I'm very busy this morning,
I should be at the hospital.

354
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,575
Well perhaps I should've
got worse yesterday.

355
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:24,411
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

356
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,750
- You're miserable today. - Well even
doctors get miserable sometimes Anna.

357
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,962
- Is it something I did?
- Don't think so.

358
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:41,888
- Bye.
- Bye.

359
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,474
I've given you some
mild sleeping pills...

360
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,142
keep a very close eye
on her temperature...

361
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,020
and let me know immediately
if she seems delirious.

362
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,064
It's not very likely,
she seems stable now.

363
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:53,817
Sarah, are you sure you're
alright, you look worried.

364
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,739
It's just a young boy I thought
was ok had a relapse yesterday.

365
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:00,074
What's wrong with him?

366
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:03,536
He has muscular dystrophy,
he's got a chest infection.

367
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,705
- Oh no.
- It's dangerous.

368
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,905
Anna, what are you doing?

369
00:45:37,155 --> 00:45:39,074
Mum, last night you
cleared up my bedroom...

370
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:41,995
I threw something away,
where's the rubbish?

371
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:43,246
I've got to find it.

372
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:46,749
I leave you alone for 5 minutes and
you work yourself up into a frenzy.

373
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,794
But I threw something away
and i've got to find it.

374
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:51,045
- What is it.
- A drawing.

375
00:45:51,045 --> 00:45:54,008
- A drawing? Can't you do another one?
- No!

376
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,304
Alright, i'll go and look, but only if
you promise to take 2 of these pills.

377
00:45:58,596 --> 00:45:59,388
Yeah!

378
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:06,354
- Yes, yes, just find it. - Ok, ok,
here, stop it, stop, here, Anna!

379
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:11,443
God, well if it's not there
there's nothing I can do, ok?

380
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:17,407
- No that's not ok.
- Well, i'll find it alright.

381
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,687
Anna!

382
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:48,149
Wait! Don't!

383
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,986
Anna! Anna!

384
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,490
Come back! Anna!

385
00:46:58,577 --> 00:47:01,580
Wait! Anna!

386
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,918
Wait!

387
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:11,299
Come on love, out of the way.

388
00:47:11,716 --> 00:47:14,427
No, I have to find something,
I threw it away by mistake.

389
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,388
- To bed now, come on!
-  No!

390
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:20,850
You're going to be sick,
really sick unless you calm down.

391
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:28,276
You've gotta help me
find it mum, please.

392
00:47:31,946 --> 00:47:35,032
Can you help?
- What type of bag was it?

393
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:35,992
Black!

394
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:39,162
Ok boys, we're looking for a black bag!

395
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:42,666
Please, let me check them.

396
00:47:44,001 --> 00:47:45,502
Open them mum, open them.

397
00:47:54,512 --> 00:47:56,681
- You missed one.
- I'm doing my best.

398
00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:00,685
It could be any of these.

399
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,571
- Look, you've lost the drawing
Anna, just accept it. - No!

400
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:12,990
- That's your lot.
- You didn't check that one.

401
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,159
If we checked every one
we'd be here all day.

402
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,120
It's no good Anna, stop it now.

403
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,418
There!

404
00:49:33,118 --> 00:49:35,913
You're going to be alright
now darling, you must sleep.

405
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,793
Mark?

406
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:23,505
Mark?

407
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:38,480
Fooled you!

408
00:50:39,357 --> 00:50:40,775
Your face.

409
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:48,199
Sorry Anna.

410
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:53,789
- How you feeling?
- Fine.

411
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:01,588
You did all this then, eh?

412
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:05,218
I don't understand you.

413
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:08,346
Mark, do you remember
anything about the real world?

414
00:51:08,638 --> 00:51:10,014
But this is the real world.

415
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,101
I suppose so.

416
00:51:14,143 --> 00:51:17,522
When i'm not here I know where
I am... and you're there too.

417
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:23,862
- What's wrong with me?
- You're in hospital.

418
00:51:25,906 --> 00:51:28,284
I wish you weren't, sorry.

419
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:35,667
Well you're right about
one thing... I am ill.

420
00:51:37,669 --> 00:51:44,093
I'm tired, like i've just run
a marathon but all the time.

421
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,306
And the big joke is I have to crawl
to move from this lump of wood.

422
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:52,184
- That must be really uncomfortable.
- And cold.

423
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:15,627
Instead of making a mess out of
this place... why don't you help me?

424
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:27,723
I think I should wake up now.

425
00:52:38,443 --> 00:52:41,404
- I can't wake up.
- I told you so.

426
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:50,373
- They've come for us.
- Who?

427
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:02,218
- It's dad!
- No, don't let him in.

428
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:04,471
- Rubbish, i'll go and fetch him.
- No!

429
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:10,894
Dad!

430
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:15,817
Dad!

431
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,863
Dad, come in, it's getting dark.

432
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:27,662
- Anna, is that you?
- Yes.

433
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,583
I'm blind!

434
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:36,714
No locks.

435
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,679
Anna, he's moving,
he's got a hammer.

436
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:10,125
- Anna!
- Go away.

437
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:14,755
Anna.

438
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:17,424
Are you ok?

439
00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:20,845
Let me in Anna.

440
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:26,392
- Behind the hills is a sea,
we have to go there. - You go.

441
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:31,064
- Listen, we can ride the bike.
- How can I ride a bike, be realistic.

442
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:32,982
You ride and i'll push.

443
00:54:33,776 --> 00:54:35,069
- You're mad.
- Anna!

444
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:36,779
Please Mark, you have to try.

445
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:49,292
Anna, i'm not going away so
you might aswell let me in.

446
00:54:51,419 --> 00:54:56,091
Let me in Anna!
Open this door now!

447
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:25,247
- You'll never get
me up on this. - Try.

448
00:56:10,546 --> 00:56:11,297
Anna.

449
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:16,010
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't.

450
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,846
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't leave you.

451
00:56:18,472 --> 00:56:20,349
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.

452
00:56:24,436 --> 00:56:25,479
There.

453
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:33,321
You've had a really bad fever darling
but I think this is the worst of it.

454
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,410
When you're better
we'll go to the seaside.

455
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:43,414
You like the sea.

456
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:50,881
We'll go there, all 3 of us, and
we'll have a big, long rest, ok.

457
00:56:52,466 --> 00:56:56,011
To the sea, to the sea,
to the beautiful sea.

458
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:01,309
Let me see, let me see it.

459
00:57:03,979 --> 00:57:07,357
You're temperature's going down,
it's normal, you're getting better.

460
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:10,653
- Don't.
- What.

461
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,490
- Who are you?
- Anna?

462
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,119
I don't talk to strangers, go away.

463
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:22,623
- Go away.
- It's mummy, you're alright now.

464
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,251
Go away!

465
00:57:27,045 --> 00:57:27,921
Anna!

466
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,008
What are you doing? Darling?

467
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:37,598
Anna! Look at me, look at me!

468
00:57:38,558 --> 00:57:41,477
Anna, please, don't!

469
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:47,108
Anna, please, don't!

470
00:57:48,026 --> 00:57:48,860
Anna!

471
00:58:18,517 --> 00:58:19,518
Mark?

472
00:58:40,749 --> 00:58:41,542
Mark?

473
00:59:29,635 --> 00:59:30,594
Mark?

474
01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:03,922
He must've taken him.

475
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:48,553
Mark?

476
01:00:52,266 --> 01:00:52,975
Mark?

477
01:00:56,646 --> 01:00:57,438
Mark?

478
01:00:58,773 --> 01:00:59,774
Anna?

479
01:01:02,235 --> 01:01:03,236
Anna?

480
01:01:11,245 --> 01:01:12,579
You're going to be alright.

481
01:01:14,915 --> 01:01:16,208
Just stay where you are.

482
01:01:21,506 --> 01:01:22,590
Daddy's here.

483
01:01:24,592 --> 01:01:25,260
Anna!

484
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:54,541
Alright...

485
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,421
if you want to play games...

486
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:08,222
One, two, three...

487
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:14,938
four, five, six...

488
01:02:16,106 --> 01:02:21,695
seven, eight, twelve,

489
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:27,786
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

490
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,876
It's you he's after not me,
you should've never come back.

491
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:37,421
I thought that he'd taken you.

492
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:39,382
Listen. it won't take
him long to find us...

493
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:42,343
You've gotta wake up and change
your stupid drawing, get rid of him.

494
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:43,219
I've tried.

495
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:45,680
No, rip him out of the
paper, it's the only way.

496
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:50,727
- I drew a lighthouse, we can go
there then we'll be safe. - Ok.

497
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:53,772
Look, just wake up, we're not going
to get anywhere with him around.

498
01:02:54,106 --> 01:02:54,898
I can't.

499
01:02:55,399 --> 01:02:57,442
- Wake up! - I can't.

500
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:04,784
Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three...

501
01:03:05,243 --> 01:03:09,789
Thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six...

502
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:12,250
I've got an idea.

503
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:15,838
Lie down like you're in bed... do it!

504
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:30,812
Reach out to where the drawing is.

505
01:03:47,955 --> 01:03:49,498
Pick up the drawing Anna.

506
01:03:58,717 --> 01:03:59,509
Careful!

507
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:20,491
- Dad's on the left, by the rocks.
- Put your finger on him.

508
01:04:28,582 --> 01:04:32,879
Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine...

509
01:04:36,216 --> 01:04:37,509
Now rip him out!

510
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:56,779
Ninety-nine, one hundred.

511
01:04:58,656 --> 01:05:00,951
I'm coming.

512
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:35,154
Run Anna, leave me.

513
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:41,077
Anna!

514
01:05:42,746 --> 01:05:45,040
Mark, Mark!

515
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:49,252
Mark!

516
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:19,369
Get off me!

517
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:39,890
Who are you?

518
01:06:41,975 --> 01:06:44,854
- What is your name?
- Please, dad, please.

519
01:06:46,356 --> 01:06:47,357
Do you know me?

520
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:51,361
Do you recognise me?

521
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,371
The sea.

522
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:34,454
Anna?

523
01:09:36,497 --> 01:09:38,666
- Anna.
- It's alright love, it's just the tube.

524
01:09:40,418 --> 01:09:41,544
There's a brave girl.

525
01:09:43,796 --> 01:09:46,800
You'll be alright, you'll be alright.

526
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:08,948
Anna?

527
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:13,871
It hurts when I breathe.

528
01:10:15,456 --> 01:10:17,291
That's just your ribs,
they're a bit bruised.

529
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:20,836
The ambulance man had
to give you a heart massage.

530
01:10:21,796 --> 01:10:25,634
- He saved your life.
- I know but it still hurts.

531
01:10:26,593 --> 01:10:27,969
You'll be out of here in a few days.

532
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,765
I've been here long enough.

533
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:36,603
How's Mark?

534
01:10:40,942 --> 01:10:42,527
- How's Mark?
- He's ok.

535
01:10:43,277 --> 01:10:44,487
Don't lie to me.

536
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:49,033
We sent him home, he'll
be more comfortable there.

537
01:10:50,326 --> 01:10:51,662
He's dying isn't he?

538
01:10:56,875 --> 01:11:00,129
- They've stopped.
- What's stopped.

539
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:03,090
My dreams.

540
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:16,939
If I tell you something,
will you keep it a secret?

541
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,864
- I know Mark, I know him
from my dreams. - Anna...

542
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:29,828
I drew a house on paper,
Mark's there too.

543
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:37,794
It was me who made Mark ill and
me who helped him get better again.

544
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:45,428
Then we had to escape and we
did but now I can't even dream.

545
01:11:48,056 --> 01:11:49,432
You have to believe me.

546
01:11:51,476 --> 01:11:54,604
When you're ill the
mind plays funny tricks.

547
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:58,776
It's not a trick...
Mark's eyes are blue...

548
01:12:00,944 --> 01:12:03,197
His left leg is
stronger than his right...

549
01:12:05,574 --> 01:12:09,537
He's got a bicycle,
a blue one, he just looks at it.

550
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:11,956
- How do you know all this?
- It's true isn't it?

551
01:12:15,835 --> 01:12:22,009
You have to get me my pencils
and drawings, you have to.

552
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:24,678
- But...
- Just do it!

553
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:29,725
And as soon as you're better...

554
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:32,186
I'm going to take us all down
to Devon for a little holiday.

555
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,315
Hey, are you listening to me?

556
01:12:36,733 --> 01:12:37,943
Look at me darling.

557
01:12:40,028 --> 01:12:43,198
That's better, I was beginning
to think I was invisible.

558
01:12:44,116 --> 01:12:46,952
You don't have to be
invisible to disappear, dad.

559
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:51,040
Anna, you said you wanted
to go to the seaside, no?

560
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:52,792
Sounds wonderful mum.

561
01:12:53,543 --> 01:12:55,002
Hey and don't forget
your riding lessons.

562
01:12:55,712 --> 01:12:57,630
I've taken time off,
we can go together if you like.

563
01:12:58,631 --> 01:12:59,966
And then you'll go away again.

564
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:05,514
I don't know what you want
these for but here they are.

565
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:11,228
She shouldn't have told you,
I told Sarah to keep it a secret.

566
01:13:12,146 --> 01:13:13,439
- Can I see?
- No.

567
01:13:17,152 --> 01:13:18,570
I wouldn't want to live if he died.

568
01:13:56,611 --> 01:13:58,988
Now if there's anything
we need we'll be alright.

569
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:09,541
Mark, Mark.

570
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:18,175
Anna.

571
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:22,472
Wait there.

572
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,023
How's that then eh?

573
01:14:32,316 --> 01:14:33,442
I thought you weren't ever coming back.

574
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:34,610
Come on, there's lots to show you...

575
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,612
You've really kitted out
the place good this time.

576
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:43,077
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Nothing, just pleased to see you.

577
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:45,914
Come on, 
let's walk along the cliffs.

578
01:14:54,798 --> 01:14:55,966
Here, I want to show you something.

579
01:14:58,009 --> 01:14:59,512
- Can you do rollovers?
- Yeah.

580
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:03,516
You haven't done them properly
until you've done them here, my way.

581
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,226
What do you mean "your way"?

582
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,519
Sit in front of me.

583
01:15:08,312 --> 01:15:11,149
Keep your head well in and
imagine you're half of a wheel.

584
01:15:12,818 --> 01:15:13,777
Now pull me.

585
01:15:33,214 --> 01:15:33,840
Again!

586
01:15:37,052 --> 01:15:38,929
How am I getting on 
in your world?

587
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,477
You're recovering
but not as fast as here.

588
01:15:45,519 --> 01:15:48,064
- So i'm different here?
- Don't know.

589
01:15:48,981 --> 01:15:52,611
I don't care what happens to me there,
as long as I can be here with you.

590
01:15:53,653 --> 01:15:57,157
You see, your world doesn't
matter any more, we can live here.

591
01:16:00,285 --> 01:16:01,578
Have you ever kissed anyone?

592
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:03,956
Me neither.

593
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:22,142
Is this snogging?

594
01:16:38,743 --> 01:16:42,414
I've walked as far as I can along
these cliffs but there's no way down.

595
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:47,378
- We should draw a ladder then.
- There's not one long enough...

596
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,131
And even if there was I wouldn't
go down there, would you?

597
01:16:50,381 --> 01:16:52,800
I know i'm getting better
but that's just stupidity.

598
01:16:54,593 --> 01:16:57,431
- You suggest something then?
- Helicopter?

599
01:16:58,432 --> 01:17:01,518
- I don't think I can draw that.
- I can.

600
01:17:09,777 --> 01:17:13,698
I brought it with me this time.
You draw the helicopter.

601
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:17,285
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

602
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,164
- Do you think it'll work for me?
- Don't know.

603
01:17:25,836 --> 01:17:27,671
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to draw.

604
01:17:27,921 --> 01:17:28,672
Wait.

605
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,341
You can't go yet.

606
01:17:36,723 --> 01:17:38,808
Well you wait down here
and keep a look out for it.

607
01:17:39,476 --> 01:17:41,186
I can see better from up there.

608
01:17:41,978 --> 01:17:46,483
To be honest i'd rather draw by myself,
I don't like people watching me.

609
01:17:47,818 --> 01:17:51,155
- And I never saw you draw did I?
- I suppose not.

610
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:54,784
- You wait down here then.
- Ok.

611
01:18:04,795 --> 01:18:06,797
Don't go without me.

612
01:18:17,308 --> 01:18:18,810
Please don't go without me.

613
01:19:29,177 --> 01:19:30,303
I've got some good news...

614
01:19:31,763 --> 01:19:35,434
They've given me a job at head office
so I don't have to go away anymore.

615
01:19:36,977 --> 01:19:37,936
That's good isn't it?

616
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:40,731
We can all be together
like a proper family.

617
01:19:48,323 --> 01:19:51,284
Things aren't the same between you
and me since I got back, are they?

618
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:56,956
I missed you when I was away but now
I feel as if i'm missing you even more.

619
01:20:00,753 --> 01:20:01,754
I'm worried.

620
01:20:05,883 --> 01:20:08,886
- I went to see your doctor.
- Why?

621
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,393
Mum said you were having bad
dreams about me, is that true?

622
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:20,857
Do you want to see
someone about the dreams?

623
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,821
- I don't have them anymore.
- Maybe because i'm back.

624
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:26,948
No, it's nothing to do with you.

625
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,286
What did Dr Nichols say?

626
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:37,876
She said you knew a
patient of hers who died.

627
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:42,381
What's the matter?

628
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,719
Mark's dead.

629
01:20:53,476 --> 01:20:54,436
Didn't you know?

630
01:20:58,481 --> 01:21:01,985
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry...

631
01:21:02,944 --> 01:21:08,159
I knew, it's just when I last saw
him I sort of hoped he'd get better.

632
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:12,580
Was he a close friend?

633
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:22,257
- Dr Nichols didn't tell me
the whole story. - Obviously.

634
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:26,052
Mark would hate
anybody being sorry.

635
01:22:27,702 --> 01:22:28,453
Come on Anna.

636
01:22:29,538 --> 01:22:30,997
Did you seen those boats there?

637
01:22:32,999 --> 01:22:34,669
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Madden.

638
01:22:50,686 --> 01:22:52,062
Hello, is everything ok?

639
01:22:55,774 --> 01:22:56,692
That's good.

640
01:22:59,194 --> 01:23:01,698
After lunch we'll go for
a walk down to the front.

641
01:23:06,995 --> 01:23:09,831
- Here.
- Thanks.

642
01:23:12,792 --> 01:23:14,170
Don't lose it.

643
01:23:17,047 --> 01:23:17,882
Dad.

644
01:23:22,344 --> 01:23:23,345
I'm sorry.

645
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,869
- What on earth for?
- Being so miserable.

646
01:23:47,205 --> 01:23:48,081
Don't be stupid.

647
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:52,251
It was the illness, when I was
ill I thought I saw funny things.

648
01:23:58,425 --> 01:24:03,555
I want to go to the pier...
to get Karen some rock.

649
01:24:07,811 --> 01:24:10,313
- Well we'll go after we've eaten.
- Good.

650
01:24:15,026 --> 01:24:18,196
- Shall I open your curtains.
- Whatever you like.

651
01:24:25,037 --> 01:24:26,372
Be careful you don't 
get sunstroke.

652
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:43,705
Mark, i'm back.

653
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:00,515
Mark.

654
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:07,689
Mark, let me in.

655
01:26:12,152 --> 01:26:12,986
Mark.

656
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:19,911
Mark.

657
01:26:23,206 --> 01:26:24,457
Mark, let me in.

658
01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:27,919
Let me in.

659
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:19,391
I don't want to go without you but the
helicopter's been hovering all day.

660
01:27:20,559 --> 01:27:21,728
I think i'm meant to go.

661
01:27:24,481 --> 01:27:29,235
Wait for me here, i'll come
back for you, love Mark.

662
01:28:24,086 --> 01:28:28,091
Mark, Mark, Mark!

663
01:28:42,857 --> 01:28:44,150
Anna!

664
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:54,077
Move back from the
edge, it's dangerous.

665
01:28:56,872 --> 01:28:58,415
- I can't reach.

666
01:28:59,207 --> 01:29:04,004
Move back from the
edge Anna, it's dangerous.

667
01:29:04,629 --> 01:29:06,924
- Anna, move away!
- I can't reach.

668
01:29:08,968 --> 01:29:12,388
Mark, I can't reach, 
don't leave me.

669
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:16,100
- Anna, it's dangerous.
- I can't reach.

670
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:20,022
- Move away from the edge.
- Don't leave me.

671
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,236
- Bye Anna.
- No!

672
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:40,710
He's alright now mum, 
I know he is.
