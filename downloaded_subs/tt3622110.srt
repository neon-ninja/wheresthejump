1
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:25,183
So, Ben, have you ever sat for her?

2
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:26,805
God, no. No.

3
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:29,721
Her subjects are mothers, babies...

4
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:32,057
...so she has no use for me.

5
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:34,559
I've read about your latest show.

6
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,394
Congratulations.

7
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:40,276
It must be a real thrill to do
all that hard work come good.

8
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,202
Yeah, it went down a storm...

9
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:47,872
...and she got a couple of commissions
which is always a bonus.

10
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:50,709
Your success will really
help your application.

11
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:54,379
Everyone here at the home is thrilled
that you've applied for custody.

12
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,849
I know that your recent relationship
with your daughter hasn't been easy...

13
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:00,582
...but Chloe needs this as much as you do.

14
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,242
Hi, Chloe.

15
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:30,012
I'll leave you to it.

16
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:40,072
My photo of you is really out of date.

17
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:46,995
So, Louisa said that you
were thinking about our offer.

18
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,482
Come and stay with us, see how you feel.

19
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,955
We've got a great bedroom.

20
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:56,141
The house is in a quiet neighborhood,
but it's just a short train...

21
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,057
Why are you doing this?

22
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,278
I was hoping...

23
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:06,932
...now that I've moved back for good that
you and I could spend some time together.

24
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:10,237
Nine years ago was when I needed you.

25
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:13,523
Didn't want me then.

26
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,495
I did.

27
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:26,102
I...

28
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:36,199
Don't come here again.

29
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,813
Don't call me.

30
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:43,953
Just leave me the fuck alone.

31
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,390
Okay?

32
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,745
Chloe, please don't leave.

33
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:39,511
Jess, you know how important tonight
is for me. Will you please get ready?

34
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,710
We're going to be late.

35
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,878
Jess?

36
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:46,882
I've already moved this dinner
twice because of you.

37
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:52,557
Tira, do you mind
if we pick this up next week?

38
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:55,727
- Of course.
- We need to leave in 20 minutes.

39
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,693
Bye, Ben.

40
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:07,171
Can you hold her?

41
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:12,076
Yeah. Okay. Hi.

42
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,814
Don't be sad about your daughter.

43
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:41,774
A mother's love for her child
is very powerful.

44
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,862
This is a talas. Its magic will help
your daughter see the love in your heart.

45
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:49,764
It's pretty. Thank you.

46
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:52,848
You're welcome. Bye.

47
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:15,754
What?

48
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:29,976
Fucking kids!

49
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:34,255
Do you remember
when we used to play that game?

50
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,362
You should see Mary's house now.
They knocked down the whole street.

51
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,834
Come. I wanna show you something.

52
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:45,500
- But I haven't finished.
- It looks great to me.

53
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:59,384
You know kids are scared to come here now?

54
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:02,620
They say that 'cause Mary's dead
there's no one left to feed the demon.

55
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,431
They reckon it's still trapped in there
waiting for someone to knock.

56
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,626
Why are we even here?
You know I hate this place.

57
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:11,693
Once to wake her from her bed.
Twice to raise her from the dead.

58
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:14,299
If you knock her door, she still hears it.

59
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,234
Sooner or later she comes knockin' for you.

60
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:18,770
That's not funny. She took Michael.

61
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,839
It's just a story. I'm sorry.
I... I didn't wanna upset you.

62
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,963
Look. I'll prove it to ya.

63
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,872
Gonna have a go?

64
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:55,364
Danny?

65
00:10:57,851 --> 00:10:59,432
Danny!

66
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,678
- Fuck! You're such a shit!
- That was great.

67
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:11,483
- Why would you do that?
- Your face.

68
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,386
Wait, I'm sorry, I'm joking, I'm joking.

69
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:18,576
Come on. You alright?

70
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,814
Danny.

71
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:32,154
It's coming.

72
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:55,010
Get out.

73
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,947
Run.

74
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:25,013
<i>Sorry, did I wake you?</i>

75
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,712
I don't feel right, Chlo.

76
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:30,979
<i>Hang on. Two secs.</i>

77
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:52,651
Sorry, that's so creepy.
I thought someone was at my door.

78
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,281
Danny?

79
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:19,430
<i>Danny's phone. Leave a message.</i>

80
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,966
Where are you?

81
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,932
Just call me, okay?

82
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:50,494
- Danny?
- <i>Run for your life.</i>

83
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:52,997
- Danny.
- <i>Chlo...</i>

84
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,630
Danny.

85
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:34,805
Do you mind? The cleaners wanna do the room.

86
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,439
Yeah, sorry. I'll just get my phone.

87
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:19,122
Someone open the door! Help!
Someone open the door!

88
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:23,688
Someone open the door!
Open the door! Open the door!

89
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:28,690
Help! Help, open the door! Please!

90
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,025
Please!

91
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:32,961
What's going on?

92
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:56,081
Ben.

93
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:58,319
What?

94
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,189
- There's someone here.
- What?

95
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:14,186
Wait.

96
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:21,442
No, no. Wait there.

97
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:41,813
Can I stay?

98
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,285
Okay. Bye.

99
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:49,103
So...

100
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:52,434
...they said that it's okay
for a few nights...

101
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:55,196
...but you have to call
Louisa in the morning.

102
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:59,814
It's lovely to have you here, Chloe.

103
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:03,685
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.

104
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,716
Sorry about the mess.

105
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:22,287
We've been redecorating.

106
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:33,017
We were really hoping that...

107
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:36,719
...you would pick
the paint color for the room...

108
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:40,324
...and, you know, just...

109
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:43,491
...make the room your own, really.

110
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:45,527
Yeah.

111
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:51,028
The bathroom is through that door.

112
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:55,305
And, Ben and I are just across the hall...

113
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,224
...if you...

114
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:59,390
...if you need anything.

115
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:03,781
This place is huge.

116
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,547
Did you win the lottery or something?

117
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:12,098
No. Although sometimes it does feel like it.

118
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:15,490
The last few years have been amazing.

119
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:21,008
The only thing missing was you, Chloe.

120
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:24,732
Well, I'm not gonna stay very long.
Couple of nights maybe.

121
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,665
Listen, about what you said before.

122
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:37,078
- I know that I can't change what I did.
- I'm pretty tired.

123
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,949
Of course.

124
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,755
See you in the morning.

125
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,592
Can you leave it open?

126
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,229
Please.

127
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:56,998
Yeah.

128
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,902
I'm really glad you're here, Chloe.

129
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:16,451
She hates me.

130
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,658
I don't blame her.

131
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:23,527
<i>Sweetheart, you can't change the past.</i>

132
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:27,195
<i>What matters is that you're trying
to do the right thing now.</i>

133
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:31,232
<i>Look, I've got to go.
I'll be back for dinner, alright?</i>

134
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,277
Why are we having this conversation
again? I thought we agreed...

135
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:43,213
...there would be no more work trips for a while.
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

136
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:46,049
- Look, it's only for a few days.
- Get someone else to go.

137
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:50,654
I would if I could. Some new client
has insisted I attend personally.

138
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:52,582
Hey, Chloe.

139
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,600
It's carrot and coriander soup.

140
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,571
I'll alert the media.

141
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:14,642
Do you like it? It's organic.

142
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:25,804
Thank you.

143
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,793
So, I was thinking...

144
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:32,062
...maybe tomorrow...

145
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:34,545
...you could give me a hand in the studio?

146
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,848
It would be a big help
to get the new collection ready.

147
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:42,269
Well, maybe she doesn't want to be an artist.

148
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:45,406
Some people have real jobs, you know.

149
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:49,179
What, like being a banker?

150
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:54,639
Okay. You got me there.
We are a bunch of shits.

151
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:57,071
You enjoy his money though, don't you?

152
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:05,543
Actually, we bought the house together.

153
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,901
Did you?

154
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:13,372
Just to be clear, I didn't
need her to, I'm bloody loaded...

155
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:17,708
...but your mother is a very stubborn,
independent woman...

156
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:22,383
...and those hideous things
she makes sell for a fortune.

157
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:38,309
- Christ! Hey.
- What's the matter?

158
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,706
Hey, let me. Let me do it.

159
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:57,979
Maybe she doesn't like coriander.

160
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,914
- I'll be back soon.
- Yeah. Bye.

161
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:18,008
Chloe?

162
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:47,816
Who are you?

163
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,755
<i>Przepraszam.</i>

164
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,729
No!

165
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,528
Jesus!

166
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,813
I heard you shouting.

167
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,233
It was just a dumb dream. I'm fine.

168
00:27:40,336 --> 00:27:41,903
What was it?

169
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,348
There was this...

170
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,693
...old woman...

171
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,753
...with red hair...

172
00:27:56,853 --> 00:28:00,457
...and she was crying...

173
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:04,258
...and she had a knife and...

174
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,295
...she killed herself.

175
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:25,050
When I was a kid there was this strange,
old woman who lived near the home.

176
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,383
<i>She had this long, dirty red hair...</i>

177
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:33,054
...everyone called her Ginger.

178
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,492
<i>And she never came out of the house,
but you'd see her in the window sometimes.</i>

179
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:43,464
And people started saying
that she was a witch.

180
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:50,703
And so after she died,
stories started that...

181
00:28:50,803 --> 00:28:53,477
<i>...if you went and knocked on her door...</i>

182
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:56,244
<i>...she would come and get you.</i>

183
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:02,091
Danny and I went there the other night.

184
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,360
<i>We knocked.</i>

185
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,663
And now Danny's gone...

186
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:15,316
...and I think she's coming for me next.

187
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:19,033
Sweetie, it was just a bad dream.

188
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,136
Please don't let her get me.

189
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:25,437
Okay.

190
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:29,126
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

191
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,149
You're safe, okay?

192
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,843
Morning.

193
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:06,164
I think we overslept.

194
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:15,256
Sorry.

195
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,476
Don't be.

196
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:42,850
It's okay.

197
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:02,102
Tira?

198
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:04,374
Am I early?

199
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:08,742
God. You know, I must have totally forgotten.

200
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:15,004
Just give me a second.

201
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,714
Alright, let's go.

202
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:23,274
We're gonna finish by the time she's walking.

203
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,709
That soon?

204
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,517
I thought you might like some coffee.

205
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,603
Gosh, would I ever? Thank you.

206
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:36,605
Sorry, Tira, this is my daugh...

207
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:38,773
...sorry. This is Chloe.

208
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:43,844
I'm sorry, I have to go.

209
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:48,148
Tira?

210
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:52,354
I think I have to go.

211
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:00,461
Tira?

212
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:04,799
What's going on?

213
00:32:06,368 --> 00:32:09,402
- Nothing. I can't stay.
- Tell me.

214
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:12,942
Be careful, Jess. You can't help her.

215
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,309
She belongs to someone else.

216
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:18,408
There's a darkness around her.

217
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:21,689
Trust me, Jess, I know about these things.

218
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:24,500
She's marked by something terrible.

219
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,921
What do you mean?

220
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,991
How's your mother been treating you?

221
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:03,593
Okay.

222
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:06,296
- You look upset.
- I'm fine.

223
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:09,641
- Are you both getting on okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,499
Are you okay?

225
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:15,770
Chloe?

226
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:19,673
This is Detective Boardman.

227
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:23,213
Don't worry, she's not in any trouble.

228
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:26,866
Friend of Chloe's, Dan Chambers,
he's been reported missing.

229
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:28,168
I'm just following up.

230
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:31,054
I was just telling her there's probably
nothing for her to worry about.

231
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:34,855
Right. And you two know each other?

232
00:33:34,955 --> 00:33:36,860
Oh, yes, we...

233
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,156
...we've known each other
since she was little.

234
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:47,403
A few years ago we got called to
Woodman House, the children's home.

235
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:49,676
One of their boys, a ten year old...

236
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:53,343
...Michael Flowers,
he'd been reported missing and...

237
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:58,048
...his mates, Chloe and Danny,
got it into their heads that...

238
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:02,650
...this old lady, Mary Aminov,
had something to do with it...

239
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,060
...and they hounded her.

240
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:14,530
Kept knocking on her door,
night after night...

241
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,663
...until in the end...

242
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:19,483
she couldn't take it anymore.

243
00:34:20,502 --> 00:34:22,369
She killed herself.

244
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:28,610
By the time we found the body,
the foxes had got to it. It was a...

245
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,248
...nasty business.

246
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:36,923
Did you ever find out
if she took Chloe's friend, Michael?

247
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:39,623
There wasn't any evidence, but...

248
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:43,910
...99% of the time when something
bad does happen to a child...

249
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,026
...it's down to someone they know.

250
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:54,470
- You said you believed us.
- And I investigated.

251
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,403
Thoroughly.

252
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,115
Now...

253
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:03,289
...when was the last time that you saw Danny?

254
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:05,679
We knocked on Ginger's door.

255
00:35:08,517 --> 00:35:11,261
She took him, and now she's coming for me.

256
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:14,405
Chloe...

257
00:35:17,393 --> 00:35:20,630
...the one thing that we
can be really certain of...

258
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:24,750
...is that old lady Aminov
is not back from the dead.

259
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:27,701
Chloe.

260
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:32,706
Must be very difficult bringing up
a child on your own.

261
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:36,246
My husband will be back in a few days.

262
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:38,480
Okay. Stay in touch.

263
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,414
Will do.

264
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,275
Hey. It's just foxes.
We get them around here.

265
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,408
What are you looking at?

266
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,332
You need to see this.

267
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:49,799
Baba Yaga, it's eastern European, I think,
but it means different things...

268
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:53,823
...evil hag, dark mother.
She's the most ancient kind of demon.

269
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:56,859
She opens a doorway between hell
and the world of men...

270
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,326
...so that she can devour the innocent.

271
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,086
Like my friend, Michael.

272
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,941
The demon's powers are limited so she
needs the help from a human slave...

273
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:15,976
...or a cursed soul to help
do her bidding here on earth.

274
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:21,512
And you can tell who the human slave is
because the demon marks them.

275
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:24,351
Look.

276
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:29,222
I bet Mary had that mark.

277
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:32,595
When you knock, the first knock
raises the demon...

278
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:35,211
...the second summons the human slave...

279
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:37,925
...and the only way that the human slave
can be free of the demon...

280
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:41,437
...is if they kill themselves or if they
trick someone else into replacing them...

281
00:37:41,537 --> 00:37:44,410
...by forcing them to do
something truly, truly evil.

282
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,223
Enough.

283
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,613
- I thought you wanted to help me.
- I do, sweetie, but this is insane.

284
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,227
What is it?

285
00:39:14,846 --> 00:39:16,663
Doesn't matter.

286
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:20,503
Yes, it does. Come here.

287
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:23,938
Come here. Okay.

288
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:31,414
We are gonna work with some clay. Here.

289
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:33,717
Warm it up in your hands.

290
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:37,617
We're just gonna put it around.

291
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,733
Like this. Doesn't have to be pretty.

292
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:44,792
Cover the whole thing.

293
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,163
Fingers too. See? Fun.

294
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:08,704
Do you remember when you
and your friends had that party and...

295
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:12,352
...you painted all those
crazy animals on my wall?

296
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,932
Yeah.

297
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:22,762
Yeah, I do.

298
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:27,109
You must have been, like...

299
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:30,120
...five? Maybe?

300
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:38,414
There was that turtle above my bed,
the big green one looking down on me.

301
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:40,380
I loved that thing.

302
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,851
That's right.

303
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,875
That horrible bear
you painted behind the door.

304
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:55,094
It used to scare me so much.

305
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:03,073
I don't remember doing that.

306
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:06,339
Probably 'cause you were high.

307
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,578
You were though, weren't you?

308
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:22,831
I was...

309
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:25,308
...I was sick.

310
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:29,680
I hate that word, but... but it's the truth.

311
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:32,814
And...

312
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,621
...when it got...

313
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,341
...really bad, I just...

314
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:45,612
...I figured that you were safer with...

315
00:41:46,848 --> 00:41:49,251
...someone else lookin' after you.

316
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:52,356
Well, I wasn't.

317
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,430
Forget it.

318
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,699
I tried to get you back sooner, I really did.

319
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:06,306
They just... they wouldn't let me.

320
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:12,808
Maybe they were right, maybe I wasn't...

321
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:16,174
...I wasn't ready back then, but...

322
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:21,781
...I'm ready now.

323
00:42:30,024 --> 00:42:32,091
God, I could use a drink.

324
00:42:35,964 --> 00:42:38,001
But we are a...

325
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:42,202
...soft drink only family now, so...

326
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,145
We've got diet and regular.

327
00:42:49,245 --> 00:42:52,047
I'm sure juice, soda water.

328
00:42:52,558 --> 00:42:55,048
And let's see.

329
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:58,151
Regular good?

330
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,527
You really shouldn't move them like that.

331
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:06,693
They're so fragile.

332
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:14,968
I'm sorry. I am not angry at you.

333
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:17,981
I thought I was safe here.

334
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:22,542
You are.

335
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:28,335
Chloe!

336
00:43:35,857 --> 00:43:38,310
Thanks for the tour.
It's an incredible house.

337
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,062
Thank you.

338
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:43,165
Do you mind if I check on Chloe?
We had a big delivery for the studio.

339
00:43:43,265 --> 00:43:45,331
No, no problem.

340
00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:08,824
- Hello, Chloe.
- Hi.

341
00:44:08,924 --> 00:44:11,757
- There's just one more box.
- Okay.

342
00:44:12,393 --> 00:44:16,662
She's been really helpful.
Okay. The studio's this way.

343
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,097
- Jesus.
- No.

344
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:33,763
What?

345
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:41,779
Did you do this?

346
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,156
No.

347
00:44:44,256 --> 00:44:46,160
What is wrong with you?

348
00:45:04,512 --> 00:45:08,040
<i>You know, I'm gonna have to put that
in my assessment, don't you?</i>

349
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:13,411
If you feel unable to cope,
Chloe can always come back to us.

350
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:16,222
You've got my number.

351
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:18,925
Okay?

352
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:53,793
<i>Hello, Woodman House child services?</i>

353
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:58,831
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

354
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:04,707
<i>Listen, whoever this is,
I can hear that you're upset.</i>

355
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:08,874
<i>Just know that you can speak to me in
confidence and I'll do my best to help you.</i>

356
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:12,081
<i>Are you still there?</i>

357
00:46:12,581 --> 00:46:14,180
<i>Hello?</i>

358
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:37,203
Chloe?

359
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:43,178
What are you doing?

360
00:46:43,278 --> 00:46:44,811
Leaving.

361
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:49,185
Why?

362
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:52,184
'Cause you're gonna send me back, aren't you?

363
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:59,709
Dump me? Isn't that what you do?

364
00:47:05,633 --> 00:47:10,036
Do you know the scariest part
about having a baby?

365
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:15,456
It's not the pain or the...

366
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:17,605
...sleepless nights.

367
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:20,079
It's not even doing it alone...

368
00:47:25,186 --> 00:47:27,053
...it's the love.

369
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:32,725
Nobody prepares you for that.

370
00:47:34,695 --> 00:47:36,499
It's like...

371
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,059
...this...

372
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:40,860
...wave that...

373
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,974
...crashes into you
and pulls you out to sea, you can't...

374
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:47,440
...you can't fight it.

375
00:47:48,843 --> 00:47:50,677
It's too strong.

376
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,992
I loved you from the moment I saw you.

377
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:13,133
I loved you when you were crying.

378
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,103
I loved you when I was high.

379
00:48:18,506 --> 00:48:20,740
I loved you when I...

380
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:27,913
...I loved you when I gave you up.

381
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,356
I loved you when I was...

382
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,893
...thousands of miles away.

383
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:46,532
And I love you now.

384
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:50,303
No matter what happens...

385
00:48:51,706 --> 00:48:54,160
...nothing will ever change that.

386
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:59,012
It wasn't me.

387
00:49:06,554 --> 00:49:08,139
Okay.

388
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:41,860
Jess?

389
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:44,889
Jess?

390
00:52:52,613 --> 00:52:54,214
Jess?

391
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:01,721
Jess?

392
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:17,237
Jess?

393
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:21,240
Run.

394
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:58,095
Jess?

395
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:03,128
Jess?

396
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:22,465
Run!

397
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:29,024
Jess, please!

398
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:32,617
Jess! Help. Help!

399
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:37,643
Don't, she's in there!

400
00:56:06,941 --> 00:56:09,274
Chloe, there's no one in there.

401
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,681
Sweetheart, there's no one in there. Okay?

402
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,660
Okay.

403
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:35,167
Okay.

404
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,904
I've got you.

405
00:56:42,943 --> 00:56:44,510
Hey.

406
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,414
I got an idea, alright?

407
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:53,253
I might need your help.

408
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,266
Okay.

409
00:57:59,787 --> 00:58:02,621
- Did you grab my passport?
- Yes.

410
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,525
We're gonna be super early, though, so.

411
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,890
Jess.

412
00:58:30,951 --> 00:58:32,163
Help!

413
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:37,990
Chloe. Chloe!

414
00:58:38,943 --> 00:58:40,446
Come on.

415
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:43,515
- No.
- Jess? Jess, please!

416
00:58:43,615 --> 00:58:46,517
- Chloe, no!
- Help!

417
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:03,497
God, no!

418
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:59,706
You finally covered up Dad's initials.

419
01:00:05,879 --> 01:00:07,763
Good choice.

420
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:14,120
What are we gonna do?

421
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:19,941
We're gonna find someone who can help.

422
01:00:20,928 --> 01:00:22,574
Okay?

423
01:00:24,298 --> 01:00:25,472
Okay.

424
01:00:37,312 --> 01:00:39,948
I'm so sorry, Jess, I want to help.

425
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:42,016
I have my own daughter to think about.

426
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:44,152
Just tell us what
we're dealing with, that's all.

427
01:00:44,252 --> 01:00:47,485
You said that Chloe belongs
to someone else, what did...

428
01:00:49,723 --> 01:00:51,790
Did you mean this?

429
01:00:52,726 --> 01:00:57,295
No. This is not right. Don't believe
everything you read on the Internet.

430
01:00:57,566 --> 01:00:59,834
It's not a Baba Yaga haunting you.

431
01:01:00,034 --> 01:01:01,670
Then what is it?

432
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:06,985
Mary was accused of a terrible crime
she didn't commit and driven to suicide.

433
01:01:07,275 --> 01:01:10,045
Chloe helped spread that lie...

434
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:12,677
...and now Mary wants revenge.

435
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:20,438
Jess, so far your love for Chloe
has protected her.

436
01:01:25,993 --> 01:01:27,859
It's my fault.

437
01:01:28,228 --> 01:01:32,163
No, it's not. Don't say that.

438
01:01:38,305 --> 01:01:39,407
Hi.

439
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:42,944
Hey! Stay away from her!
I don't want you near my baby.

440
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:45,877
Okay. Okay.

441
01:01:46,246 --> 01:01:48,250
Tira, how do I stop this?

442
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,753
Jess, there is only one way
to save your daughter.

443
01:01:51,853 --> 01:01:54,322
- How?
- By clearing Mary's name.

444
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:57,610
If she didn't take that boy,
then find out who did.

445
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,121
And if you listen hard enough,
perhaps she will guide you.

446
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,614
What do you think?

447
01:02:11,688 --> 01:02:13,222
Chloe?

448
01:02:14,374 --> 01:02:15,908
Chloe!

449
01:02:22,649 --> 01:02:26,558
That missing boy Michael... were there
ever any other suspects besides Mary?

450
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:30,645
Not as I recall.
Chances are he just ran away.

451
01:02:30,745 --> 01:02:34,095
But Chloe said that you believed her about
Mary taking Michael, what changed your mind?

452
01:02:34,195 --> 01:02:36,301
<i>I didn't say I changed my mind.</i>

453
01:02:36,831 --> 01:02:39,097
We closed the case, that's all.

454
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,034
Jess.

455
01:03:04,187 --> 01:03:08,133
<i>And if you listen hard enough,
perhaps she will guide you.</i>

456
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,120
"Michael Flowers."

457
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:20,962
<i>That Michael Flowers,
he's not the first, is he?</i>

458
01:05:21,362 --> 01:05:24,899
<i>What about her? Or her? Or him?</i>

459
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:26,865
<i>Tell me!</i>

460
01:05:28,736 --> 01:05:32,674
<i>What do you think will happen to you...</i>

461
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:36,207
<i>...when people find out what you did?</i>

462
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:41,513
<i>I will make sure that everybody does.</i>

463
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:16,441
We're here to discuss what happens next.

464
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:19,287
What do you mean?

465
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:24,526
Chloe was very upset when Detective Boardman
returned her to us this morning.

466
01:06:24,826 --> 01:06:29,363
He's raised some serious concerns
about your relationship with her.

467
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:31,915
Just trying to protect her.

468
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:37,738
- She needs me.
- She spent last night alone on the streets.

469
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:41,626
She believes that witches
are conspiring to feed her to a demon.

470
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:45,644
How exactly is exposing her to this
kind of nonsense protecting her?

471
01:06:46,313 --> 01:06:48,647
Have you asked Chloe what she wants?

472
01:06:49,433 --> 01:06:51,019
Jess...

473
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:53,710
...are you using again?

474
01:06:56,623 --> 01:06:57,565
No.

475
01:06:57,665 --> 01:07:00,880
Then would it be alright with you
to provide a sample?

476
01:07:04,264 --> 01:07:05,913
Sure.

477
01:07:06,532 --> 01:07:09,804
- You got a cup?
- You're showing some aggression.

478
01:07:10,704 --> 01:07:12,991
You have no idea.

479
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:16,241
No fucking idea.

480
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:20,481
I am just trying to protect her, okay?

481
01:07:20,581 --> 01:07:22,810
She's my daughter.

482
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,807
She's mine.

483
01:07:26,469 --> 01:07:28,703
Goddammit!

484
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,631
There will have to be a full review
but it's only fair to warn you...

485
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:40,114
...that in light of what's happened
it is very likely your contact with Chloe...

486
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:42,070
...will be restricted.

487
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:45,206
She's a traumatized,
vulnerable young woman...

488
01:07:45,306 --> 01:07:48,166
...who needs a stable environment.

489
01:07:48,876 --> 01:07:51,126
Perhaps you should consider
counseling for your own issues...

490
01:07:51,226 --> 01:07:54,238
- ...before reapplying for custody.
- Michael Flowers.

491
01:07:54,338 --> 01:07:56,117
Sorry?

492
01:07:56,217 --> 01:07:58,770
- Is this Detective Boardman?
- What?

493
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:04,258
- Is this Detective Boardman?
- Yes. He's volunteered here for years.

494
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:06,424
The kids love him.

495
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:12,343
<i>But 99% of the time when something
bad does happen to a child...</i>

496
01:08:12,443 --> 01:08:14,893
Jess, we're not finished.

497
01:08:15,253 --> 01:08:17,485
<i>...it's down to someone they know.</i>

498
01:08:33,753 --> 01:08:36,554
Chloe. Come on.

499
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,130
- Shit.
- This way.

500
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,712
Jess, I don't think I can help her.

501
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:57,428
Please, Tira, we don't have anyone else.

502
01:08:57,528 --> 01:09:00,078
- <i>Okay. I'll see what I can do.</i>
- Okay.

503
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:03,981
Meet me back in the park.
I don't live far from there.

504
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:16,572
Thanks for coming back for me.

505
01:09:22,952 --> 01:09:24,660
Chloe!

506
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:28,812
Chloe!

507
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:31,145
Chloe!

508
01:11:20,753 --> 01:11:22,421
Shit.

509
01:11:33,766 --> 01:11:35,362
Chloe?

510
01:11:36,603 --> 01:11:38,666
Chloe, is that you?

511
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:44,212
- Yeah, I've got her.
- No, I need more time. I need more time.

512
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:47,481
You didn't give me enough time. I can bring
you what you need. I just need more time.

513
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:49,383
- Come with us.
- I don't know what to do!

514
01:11:49,483 --> 01:11:51,782
Come outside. Don't resist.

515
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:56,587
Wait. Wait.

516
01:11:57,824 --> 01:12:00,499
Just stay with her. I'll be back.

517
01:12:58,618 --> 01:13:00,751
You're expecting someone else?

518
01:13:14,234 --> 01:13:18,414
This little reformed character act
you've got going it's...

519
01:13:18,514 --> 01:13:20,705
...paper thin, isn't it?

520
01:13:22,275 --> 01:13:26,564
Scratch the surface and you're still
the same selfish piece of shit...

521
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:30,709
...that abandoned your kid as soon
as she got in the way of your career.

522
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:34,588
You don't know me.

523
01:13:34,688 --> 01:13:38,256
No. You don't understand.

524
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:45,763
You fucked up
that poor little girl's life once.

525
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:50,271
And I am not gonna let you fuck it up again.

526
01:13:50,871 --> 01:13:54,105
Now, where did you take Chloe?

527
01:13:55,074 --> 01:13:57,078
What did you do with her?

528
01:13:57,478 --> 01:13:59,577
Where is she?

529
01:14:03,716 --> 01:14:06,250
- She took her.
- Who?

530
01:14:10,023 --> 01:14:12,056
Mary Aminov.

531
01:14:13,593 --> 01:14:16,230
- Ginger.
- What?

532
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:18,432
I thought I could protect her.

533
01:14:18,532 --> 01:14:21,135
But once you knock, she doesn't stop.

534
01:14:21,235 --> 01:14:24,772
- She just keeps coming.
- Enough!

535
01:14:24,872 --> 01:14:27,751
Tell me the truth.

536
01:14:31,978 --> 01:14:34,612
You didn't tell me the truth.

537
01:14:35,598 --> 01:14:38,466
You said that the kids hounded that woman.

538
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:41,036
But it was you.

539
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:44,258
You blamed her for the killings.

540
01:14:44,758 --> 01:14:48,507
You kept at her
until she couldn't take it anymore.

541
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,781
She killed herself.

542
01:14:55,935 --> 01:14:59,537
She got what she deserved.

543
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,766
Did she?

544
01:15:03,991 --> 01:15:06,034
Did she really?

545
01:15:08,214 --> 01:15:11,167
It's usually down to someone they know.

546
01:15:11,267 --> 01:15:13,697
That's what you told me.

547
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,926
- So?
- So you knew them better than she did.

548
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:22,817
You knew Michael, you knew all the kids.

549
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:27,368
Why were you so determined
to point the finger at Mary?

550
01:15:27,468 --> 01:15:29,704
Was she an easy scapegoat?

551
01:15:30,304 --> 01:15:32,560
Why were there never any other suspects?

552
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:35,409
How did it happen?

553
01:15:35,509 --> 01:15:38,329
How does something like that happen?

554
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:41,949
Did you see him out on the street that night?

555
01:15:42,049 --> 01:15:44,682
Did you offer to give him a ride home?

556
01:15:45,818 --> 01:15:48,352
How many others have you taken?

557
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:09,674
We'll talk again later.

558
01:17:54,013 --> 01:17:55,830
Come on.

559
01:18:03,589 --> 01:18:05,193
Come on.

560
01:18:05,293 --> 01:18:08,533
Come on. Come on.

561
01:18:09,178 --> 01:18:12,965
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

562
01:20:25,097 --> 01:20:26,680
Chloe?

563
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,146
Chloe.

564
01:20:32,421 --> 01:20:34,055
Jess.

565
01:20:34,907 --> 01:20:36,405
Jess.

566
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:42,780
This way.

567
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:55,535
Chloe?

568
01:20:57,096 --> 01:20:58,713
Hello?

569
01:21:07,373 --> 01:21:10,441
Wait. Wait!

570
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:13,061
Wait.

571
01:21:28,427 --> 01:21:29,961
Hello?

572
01:21:41,173 --> 01:21:42,741
Chloe?

573
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,366
Michael.

574
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,662
Help! Help!

575
01:22:51,778 --> 01:22:54,479
Get away! No!

576
01:23:53,205 --> 01:23:54,882
Jess!

577
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:59,275
Hi. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

578
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:13,257
It's coming.

579
01:24:17,714 --> 01:24:19,463
Let's go!

580
01:25:20,193 --> 01:25:21,726
Help!

581
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:28,531
Help us!

582
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,684
Come on!

583
01:26:01,468 --> 01:26:03,098
Run.

584
01:26:08,007 --> 01:26:09,386
No!

585
01:26:11,927 --> 01:26:13,755
Come on!

586
01:26:15,914 --> 01:26:17,581
Wait!

587
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:25,256
Help me. Help me.

588
01:26:42,724 --> 01:26:46,836
Come on. Come on, we gotta go. Come on.

589
01:27:03,161 --> 01:27:05,162
What the fuck?

590
01:27:07,232 --> 01:27:08,884
Jess?

591
01:27:09,284 --> 01:27:10,901
Jess.

592
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,816
What are you doing?

593
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:25,749
Where's Jess?

594
01:27:26,652 --> 01:27:28,657
I'm calling the police.

595
01:27:55,464 --> 01:27:57,018
Ben?

596
01:28:31,618 --> 01:28:35,225
So, Chloe and I are home.

597
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,629
We're safe.

598
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:41,989
So, come back.

599
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:45,015
Okay. Bye. Love you.

600
01:28:52,137 --> 01:28:54,007
You okay?

601
01:28:54,407 --> 01:28:56,639
Just thinking about Boardman.

602
01:28:57,159 --> 01:28:59,893
He did some very bad things.

603
01:29:01,947 --> 01:29:03,917
He had it coming.

604
01:29:04,017 --> 01:29:06,566
What do you mean? What did he do?

605
01:29:07,553 --> 01:29:09,582
Your friend, Michael...

606
01:29:10,306 --> 01:29:12,342
...Boardman is the one who really took him.

607
01:29:12,442 --> 01:29:16,460
He made everyone think that it was Mary
so they wouldn't suspect him.

608
01:29:16,996 --> 01:29:19,165
He got what he deserved.

609
01:29:19,265 --> 01:29:23,904
Boardman didn't take Michael.
He was a good man. He always protected us.

610
01:29:24,004 --> 01:29:26,539
How are you? You being taken care of?

611
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,416
He's volunteered here for years.
The kids love him.

612
01:29:30,844 --> 01:29:34,214
- What are you talking about?
- I saw Michael.

613
01:29:34,314 --> 01:29:36,670
<i>Mary fed him to the demon.</i>

614
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:39,262
<i>Boardman was the only one who believed us.</i>

615
01:29:39,552 --> 01:29:42,806
And I investigated. Thoroughly.

616
01:29:46,391 --> 01:29:49,874
Everybody knows what you did.

617
01:29:51,363 --> 01:29:54,064
- <i>She killed herself.</i>
- No!

618
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,401
<i>She got what she deserved.</i>

619
01:30:04,209 --> 01:30:06,929
And the only way that the human
slave can be free of the demon...

620
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:09,040
...is if they kill themselves.

621
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,602
Or if they trick someone else into
replacing them by forcing them...

622
01:30:13,702 --> 01:30:15,555
...to do something truly, truly evil.

623
01:30:15,855 --> 01:30:18,458
<i>Mary was the demon's slave.</i>

624
01:30:18,558 --> 01:30:20,960
<i>She killed herself to be free.</i>

625
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,812
<i>Tira lied to me.</i>

626
01:30:22,912 --> 01:30:26,659
- It's not a Baba Yaga haunting you.
- She tricked me.

627
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:31,171
If she didn't take that boy,
then find out who did.

628
01:30:31,271 --> 01:30:34,337
She made me believe that Boardman was guilty.

629
01:30:46,886 --> 01:30:48,534
Shit!
