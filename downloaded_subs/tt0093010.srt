1
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,260
<i>Well, there is one thing... </i>

2
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:01,965
<i>I'd like to ask you. </i>

3
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,765
<i>How do they make that slime
they're always dumping on you? </i>

4
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:08,201
<i>Oh, well. First, 
they take some liquid. </i>

5
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,443
<i>And then they add some
Jell-O powder and some flour... </i>

6
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:14,071
<i>and sometimes some soap, 
then they dump it all over me. </i>

7
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:17,574
You better get going, kiddo.
We're gonna be late.

8
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,585
<i>Very interesting. 
Is it always green? </i>

9
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:31,258
<i>Yeah, it usually is, 
but I guess it could be red. </i>

10
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:37,297
<i>Or it could be blue. </i>

11
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,711
Daddy, telephone.

12
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,645
Thanks, darling.

13
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,157
Hello.

14
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:12,036
Hildy, I'm fine.
I just stubbed my toe.

15
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,936
Hang on one second, will you?

16
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,597
Honey, it's Hildy.

17
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,907
I'll call her back.

18
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:22,547
She's in the bathroom. She wants
to know what you're wearing.

19
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,344
My black suit.

20
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:27,552
She's gonna wear her black dress.

21
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,646
Well, it's gonna be business.
You know how those things are.

22
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:35,492
Ellen, I don't want you
messing with my makeup. I'm late.

23
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:38,426
- Is her red dress okay?
- It's perfect.

24
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:40,565
Did you hear that?
You got it.

25
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:42,828
Okay, darling.
See you later. Bye.

26
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:44,694
Oh, man.

27
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:49,575
I told you a million times not
to play with my lipstick, right?

28
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:52,076
So when are you gonna
listen to me, huh?

29
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:53,772
Silly girl.

30
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,141
Honey, where's my blue suit?

31
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,381
It's on the back of the door.

32
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,592
Oh, shit.

33
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,560
Shit, shit, shit.

34
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,188
Shit, shit, shit.

35
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:23,335
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi, Christine.

36
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,075
- How you doin'?
- Good.

37
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,477
- Where's your mom?
- She's in the bathroom.

38
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:31,241
I got you a present.
Wanna see what it is?

39
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:35,586
- Do you like it?
- Uh-huh.

40
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,748
Okay, come on.
Let's go find Mommy.

41
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:57,142
Hiya, Chuck. How are you? Good to
see you. Can you make it Friday?

42
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,974
- I'm there.
- We need you. We're in the cellar.

43
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,147
Dan, is my hair okay?

44
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,183
- You look great.
- I'm serious.

45
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:06,151
You're the prettiest woman
in the room, sweetheart.

46
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,186
Liar.

47
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,886
Hiya, Bob. How are you?

48
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:17,662
Glad you could make it, Dan.
Sorry about the meeting tomorrow.

49
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,062
I know it's a Saturday,
but we got a real crisis.

50
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,667
I understand. Do you know
my wife Beth? Bob Drimmer.

51
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,498
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

52
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:26,967
- Hope you like sushi.
- Love it, Bob.

53
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,165
- What did he do to his neck?
- He was screwin' his wife.

54
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,677
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely. You should see his wife.

55
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:35,077
They had to take her out
on a stretcher.

56
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:38,945
- You guys are bad!
- Do you want champagne?

57
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,186
- Champagne for everyone.
- With a twist.

58
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:43,051
Four champagnes over here.

59
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,723
Excuse me. Hi.

60
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,193
Thank you.

61
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:50,991
Thank you very much.

62
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,699
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

63
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,132
Fuck!

64
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,567
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

65
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,197
So, what great cultural event
are we here to celebrate tonight?

66
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:04,732
- Some exercise manual.
- Not another one.

67
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,905
This one's different.

68
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,044
It's based on
ancient samurai discipline.

69
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:13,718
Danny, look at this guy nod.

70
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:15,777
What is that,
part of the ritual?

71
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,691
Hi there.

72
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:28,392
- Jesus! If looks could kill.
- Glad you haven't lost your touch.

73
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:30,735
I think she likes me.
I think she wants me.

74
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:33,237
I think you're batting zero for two,
and I don't wanna know you.

75
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,740
- She was undressing me with her eyes.
- You think so? Good luck, pal.

76
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,708
She had trouble with the buttons.

77
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,265
- Can I get a champagne, please?
- You got it.

78
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,966
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.

79
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,775
Was it that bad?

80
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:14,745
I was glad I wasn't on the receiving end
of that one. Cheers.

81
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:17,680
I hate it when guys think
they can come on like that.

82
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,181
Jimmy's okay.

83
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,583
He's just a little insecure
like the rest of us.

84
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:27,793
- My name is Dan Gallagher.
- Alex Forest.

85
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,385
Nice to meet you.
And what is your connection here?

86
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:33,832
I'm an editor at Robbins and Hart.
And you?

87
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:36,801
I'm with Miller, Goodman and Hurst.
I do all your legal work.

88
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,099
I haven't seen you around
their office, though.

89
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:42,102
I've just been with them
a couple of weeks.

90
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:52,874
- I have to go.
- Is that your wife?

91
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:55,945
Better run along.

92
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,755
It was very nice to meet you.

93
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:12,360
- Give me a break.
- Give you a break? What does this mean?

94
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:15,169
- How many did you buy?
- What does this mean?

95
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,816
- Thanks again, Christine.
- Anytime, Mrs. Gallagher.

96
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,443
Good night.

97
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,820
Aren't you forgetting something?

98
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,967
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.

99
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,513
You're such a good boy, yes.

100
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:10,954
You did such good business.
You're the best, boy.

101
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,670
It's just for tonight, honey.

102
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,175
When you first see a house,
don't show any interest at all.

103
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:31,383
- Otherwise you can't negotiate.
- Will you stop worrying about it?

104
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:34,750
- Ellen, are you chewing gum again?
- We can't afford it anyway.

105
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:38,355
Look, there's no harm in looking.
It's just up the road from Mom and Dad.

106
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,392
- Just another reason not to buy it.
- I didn't hear that.

107
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,895
Really nothing to worry about.
We can't afford it anyway.

108
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:47,627
Come on.
Hold on a minute, honey.

109
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:52,233
Let's just not worry about it.
I haven't seen the damn place yet.

110
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:54,906
I may not even like it.

111
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,965
Ellen, the gum.

112
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,604
Thank you.

113
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,208
Come on, Quincy.

114
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:05,416
No, honey. Quincy's
gotta stay here with Daddy.

115
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,419
- Daddy's gonna be all alone.
- Sorry, Quincy.

116
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,012
- Don't forget to walk him.
- I promise.

117
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,915
You promise? Okay.
You have a good meeting.

118
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:15,517
- See you tomorrow night.
- I love you.

119
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:40,714
<i>Two times down. Third time up
he looked like a jellyfish. </i>

120
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:47,960
Sorry to ruin your weekend. Please
give my apologies to your lovely wife.

121
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:49,517
I will.

122
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,362
- So, how you feeling?
- Don't ask.

123
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,969
Henry's out of town, so I asked
Alex Forest to stand in for him.

124
00:10:57,036 --> 00:11:00,005
- Anybody know where she is?
- She's on her way.

125
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,307
Since we got a little time, maybe you
can tell us what happened to your neck.

126
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,744
That's cute. Very cute.

127
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,983
Sorry I'm late.
I was getting the file.

128
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,349
This is Alex Forest,
our new associate editor.

129
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:16,283
We've met before.

130
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:18,956
Okay, can we get started?

131
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:22,494
Okay, here's the story.
You want to publish a novel...

132
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:26,157
in which one character is a senator
from New Jersey who's foolin' around.

133
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:29,364
Now, there's a certain congressman
from Ohio...

134
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:33,496
who claims the character's based on him
and filed an injunction against this.

135
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,007
The congressman's bald.
This guy has hair.

136
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,770
They're from different states.

137
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,500
If we don't sell those books,
we're screwed.

138
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:43,242
If I go to court to prove this senator's
not based upon this congressman...

139
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,983
then I have to know the truth.

140
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,019
Now...

141
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,181
strictly between these walls,
all right...

142
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:54,924
did the author have an affair
with Mr. Ohio or not?

143
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,158
Yeah, she did.

144
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:05,537
But she also had a lot of affairs
with other politicians.

145
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,199
Any one of them
could make the same claim.

146
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,542
She swears
this character's fictitious.

147
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,100
I just got off the phone with her.

148
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:13,943
And you believe her?

149
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,945
Yeah, I believe her.

150
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:22,247
Now that we got that on the table,
what can we do to lift that injunction?

151
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:25,250
If we believe the girl, is there some
way we can get to the congressman?

152
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,059
They take campaign contributions.
Can we buy him off?

153
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:32,325
Can we frighten him off? Is there
something in his past we can find?

154
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:35,192
We need to use some leverage.

155
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,048
Give me a break!

156
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:55,452
Come on.

157
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:15,107
- Is it made in Taiwan?
- These are tough to find.

158
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,642
Oh, wait, wait. Here.
We got one.

159
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,169
Come on!

160
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,981
You wanna go get a drink?

161
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:28,085
Yeah, I'd love it.

162
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:37,128
The strangest case I ever handled?

163
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:40,688
Well, the truth was
I never actually handled it...

164
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,634
but the strangest case
I ever came near to...

165
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:48,299
was when my parents got divorced
and my mother asked me to represent her.

166
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,233
- You're kidding.
- That's what I said.

167
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:54,636
"What do you mean?" she told me.
"You know what an asshole the guy is.

168
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,342
You've been a witness to this marriage
for 29 years."

169
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,651
Can you believe this?
This is coming from my mother.

170
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:04,156
- How did you get out of it?
- You can't turn your mother down.

171
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,987
So, I escaped on a technicality.

172
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,696
- Which was what?
- I didn't practice family law.

173
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:14,965
And it was true, you know,
and she bought it.

174
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:18,431
- Are you making this up?
- Could I make something up like that?

175
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,571
Waiter.

176
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:27,678
I've got a lot of pull here.
My favorite restaurant.

177
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,840
- I noticed.
- They know me well.

178
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:34,379
Miss. You want a coffee?
Can we have two coffees, please?

179
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,383
Well, I'll tell you, it's...

180
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,193
- You want one?
- No, thank you.

181
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:46,094
It's funny being a lawyer.
It's like being a doctor.

182
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,699
Everybody is telling you
their innermost secrets.

183
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,292
Oh, God.

184
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,704
You must have to be discreet.

185
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,239
Oh, God, yeah.

186
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:55,831
Are you?

187
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,040
Am I what?

188
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,339
Discreet.

189
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,723
Yes, I'm discreet.

190
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,351
Me too.

191
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:24,668
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

192
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:28,205
- Why don't you have a date tonight?
- I did have a date.

193
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,777
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.

194
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:37,146
Does that make you feel good?

195
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,444
It doesn't make me feel bad.

196
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,086
So, where's your wife?

197
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,224
Where's my wife?

198
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:53,731
My wife is in the country with
her parents, visiting for the weekend.

199
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,929
And you're here with a strange girl
being a naughty boy.

200
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,670
I don't think having dinner
with anybody is a crime.

201
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:03,899
Not yet.

202
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,870
Will it be?

203
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:09,780
I don't know.
What do you think?

204
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:12,409
I definitely think
it's gonna be up to you.

205
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:20,155
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.

206
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,559
At least you're very honest.

207
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:32,826
We were attracted to each other
at the party. That was obvious.

208
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:38,071
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.

209
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,782
We're two adults.

210
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,918
Let's get the check.

211
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:43,093
- Oh, that was great.
- Thank God.

212
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,409
Are you feeling energetic?

213
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,982
What do you have in mind?

214
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:52,469
You live in this building?

215
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:02,377
Well, where can I get a cab?
Do you know?

216
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,855
- Have you ever done it in an elevator?
- Not recently.

217
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,187
I'll bet you haven't.

218
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:14,612
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

219
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:16,204
How are you?

220
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:27,090
<i>Hi. What happened to you? </i>

221
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,617
<i>I tried you earlier. I'm gonna go... 
I guess you're not back yet. </i>

222
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:34,120
<i>I'm gonna go to bed now, 
so call me in the morning. Bye-bye. </i>

223
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:57,417
Oh, Dan, darling.
We were expecting you.

224
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:59,122
<i>I had work to do. </i>

225
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:02,092
That's a pity. We really
wanted you to see that house.

226
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:05,163
<i>- I'll see it next time. 
- Of course. You wanna speak to Beth?</i>

227
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,031
<i>Hold on a second. </i>

228
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:13,127
The phone. It's Dan.
Here you are.

229
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:18,007
Hello.
What happened to you?

230
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:23,308
Hi. Nothing. I just went out
and had dinner with Bill last night.

231
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:25,843
How is he?

232
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:30,611
He's... Bill's Bill,
the same as usual.

233
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,589
<i>Is he still with that girl? </i>

234
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:35,092
Well, he wasn't last night.

235
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,628
I think it's over.
He didn't wanna talk about it.

236
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:41,098
So, you getting any work done?

237
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,360
<i>Yeah, I'm working. </i>

238
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:45,831
There's some of the spaghetti sauce
in the refrigerator if you get hungry.

239
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,639
Great. Okay.
How's Ellen doing?

240
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:51,107
She is having the best time.

241
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:53,906
I just hope that Dad survives it.

242
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,546
Honey, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

243
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,117
she wants a rabbit.

244
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:01,618
<i>No rabbits! </i>

245
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:05,112
Jesus Christ! This goddamn family's
turning into Noah's ark.

246
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,887
I mean, please, give her a kiss,
all right? But no promises.

247
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:11,128
<i>- All right.
- When are you coming home? </i>

248
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,891
<i>- Well, it's getting complicated.
- Why's that? </i>

249
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:15,098
There's a problem with the house.

250
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:17,634
They sold it?

251
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:21,639
Very funny. No, we can't get in
to see it until late this afternoon.

252
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,870
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I thought I would come in tomorrow.

253
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,474
What about school?

254
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:31,147
She's only five years old.
What's she going to miss, trigonometry?

255
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:34,652
Okay, all right. Then I'll see you
when I get home from work.

256
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,881
Okay. See you tomorrow.

257
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,156
Okay. Thanks.
Have a good time.

258
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:40,623
Bye.

259
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,667
What happened?

260
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:52,636
I woke up, you weren't here.
I hate that.

261
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:01,109
You didn't get my note?

262
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:02,679
<i>What note? </i>

263
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:05,546
I left you a note
right by your bed.

264
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,229
That's nice.

265
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:20,254
I thought we were gonna
spend the day together.

266
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:24,190
Alex, I got so much work
to do today. I can't.

267
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,703
<i>Why don't you just come over. 
I'll cook us lunch. </i>

268
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:29,366
I got to take the dog for a walk.
The poor dog has not been out all day.

269
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:31,707
<i>I gotta take him out. </i>

270
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,712
Bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook.

271
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,839
Come on.

272
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,716
Listen. I'd love to, but I can't.
I really can't.

273
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,253
<i>Do what you have to do, 
then come over afterwards. </i>

274
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,187
<i>We can always eat late. </i>

275
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:49,717
Or you can work here.

276
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:54,129
I won't disturb you, I promise.
I'll be a good girl.

277
00:25:57,302 --> 00:26:00,465
You don't give up, do you?
You just don't give up.

278
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:02,265
Come on, Quincy.

279
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:22,953
Help, Quincy.

280
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,761
I got it. I got it.

281
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,196
He's free.
Quincy, cover me.

282
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,732
I'm up. Go deep.
He fires.

283
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:31,267
Throws.

284
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:34,134
She got it.
Yes, it's back.

285
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:36,832
Over the head.
He's got it.

286
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:53,757
Dan, can you hear me?

287
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,315
Oh, my God.

288
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,494
- You bastard.
- Your face.

289
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:10,308
- That was a shitty thing to do.
- I'm sorry. I was just fooling around.

290
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,741
My father died of a heart attack.

291
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,543
I was seven years old.
It happened right in front of me.

292
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:22,547
Honey, I'm sorry.

293
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:26,517
Really, I had no idea. If I did,
I never would have done that.

294
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,888
What, he didn't die?
He's alive?

295
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,698
Yeah, he's alive and well
and living in Phoenix.

296
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:44,466
You certainly got me,
didn't you?

297
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:04,986
Let's hear it.

298
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:11,198
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.

299
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,666
Goes with the opera.

300
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,880
It smells so good.

301
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,547
- Anything else for me to do?
- No, nothing.

302
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:34,323
Just make yourself at home.
You can change the tape.

303
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:37,724
<i>No, this is great.
I love Madame Butterfly. </i>

304
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:40,898
Really?
It's my favorite opera.

305
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,228
Mine too.

306
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,697
First opera I ever saw.

307
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,531
My father, he took me to the old Met.
I was five years old.

308
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:51,442
Did it make any sense?

309
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:52,909
I got most of it.

310
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:57,312
There was this US sailor settin' up
house with this Japanese lady.

311
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:03,944
That was all fine,
but in the final act...

312
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:06,219
after he left her...

313
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:11,929
my father told me
she's gonna kill herself...

314
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,965
and I was terrified.

315
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:17,230
I was... I climbed
right underneath the chair.

316
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:21,062
It's right here.

317
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,065
This is it.

318
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,078
It's funny.

319
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:39,717
What?

320
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:43,927
One of the only times I recall my father
being nice to me when I was a kid...

321
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,192
<i>comforting me at Madame Butterfly. </i>

322
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:24,460
What?

323
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:29,101
What are you thinking about?

324
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,538
I was wondering why is it that all the
interesting guys are always married?

325
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,281
Maybe that's why you find them
interesting... you can't have them.

326
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,820
How long have you been married?

327
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,755
Nine years.

328
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:50,553
Do you have any kids?

329
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:53,227
I got a six-year-old girl.

330
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,696
Sounds good.

331
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:02,395
I'm lucky.

332
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:06,138
So what are you doing here?

333
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,819
You know how to ask them.

334
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:20,857
I really wanna know.

335
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:23,894
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.

336
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,624
Is that so terrible?

337
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,525
No.

338
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,630
I just don't think
it's possible, though.

339
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:39,376
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.

340
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:43,004
I just wanna know where I stand.

341
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:49,511
I think you're terrific.

342
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,358
But I'm married.

343
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:58,724
What can I say?

344
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:06,027
Just my luck.

345
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,124
Oh, shit.

346
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:39,094
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.

347
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:42,438
I thought you said she wasn't
coming back till tomorrow.

348
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:46,739
She's not, but I got things to do.
I gotta go home.

349
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:51,243
I don't think I like this.

350
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,440
Like what?

351
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:57,477
The way you run away
after every time we make love.

352
00:32:57,956 --> 00:33:00,948
What difference does it make
whether I leave now or in the morning?

353
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,459
- The fact is I gotta go.
- You're not gonna leave now.

354
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:05,359
- Come on. Will you stop it?
- I mean it!

355
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,690
Come on. Hey!

356
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:13,867
What's the problem?

357
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,838
I'm sorry.

358
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:22,411
Jesus Christ.
I mean, let's be reasonable.

359
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:24,480
Be reasonable?

360
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,073
What?

361
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:29,019
"Thank you. Good-bye.
Don't call me. I'll call you."

362
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:30,987
Look, you knew about me,
all right.

363
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:33,387
I didn't hide anything.

364
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,492
- I thought it was understood.
- What was understood?

365
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,994
The opportunity was there
and we took it.

366
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,996
Come on now.
We are adults, aren't we?

367
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:41,998
What's that supposed to mean?

368
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,001
- I thought we'd have a good time.
- No, you didn't.

369
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:48,004
You thought you'd have a good time.
You didn't stop to think about me.

370
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:50,632
That's crazy.
You knew the rules.

371
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:53,067
What rules?

372
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:56,513
Look. I like you.

373
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:59,982
And if I wasn't with somebody else,
then maybe I'd be with you, but I am.

374
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,284
Please don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.

375
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,683
If you told me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.

376
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,687
All right then. Fuck off.

377
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,499
And you get out!

378
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,781
I'm going.

379
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:42,286
Why don't you come over here
and say good-bye nicely?

380
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,527
Let's be friends.

381
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,199
Baby, no.

382
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:00,701
It's okay.

383
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:04,570
Sorry if I upset you.

384
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:07,379
It's okay.
It's okay, really.

385
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:19,095
It's okay. All right.
It's okay now.

386
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,326
Your hands are all wet.

387
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:26,100
Oh, Jesus!

388
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,264
Jesus Christ!
Come here, come here!

389
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,477
Hold on, hold on.

390
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:45,212
Nice and tight.

391
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,491
Hi. Did you just call me?

392
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:04,530
I was in the shower and I heard
the phone. I thought it was you.

393
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,738
So how are you?
Did you have a good day?

394
00:37:14,712 --> 00:37:16,680
Really?

395
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,649
That's terrific.
That's really terrific.

396
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:21,617
You sound excited.

397
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:31,661
No, I'm not against the idea.
Don't get me wrong.

398
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,629
It's just the money.

399
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:46,442
Okay, darling.

400
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,069
I love you.

401
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:50,913
Bye.

402
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:21,444
How are you feeling?

403
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:26,779
Okay.

404
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:31,044
I gotta go.

405
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:34,889
Will you call me sometime?

406
00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:37,687
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

407
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:39,963
No, I want to.

408
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:43,330
You promise me
you're gonna go see the doctor.

409
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,344
Good-bye.

410
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,385
You take care.

411
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:03,852
You too.

412
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,179
Shit.

413
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:37,387
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here?

414
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:40,253
A little spaghetti and meat sauce.
That's it, buddy.

415
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,892
We'll make an Italian out of you yet.
That's a good boy.

416
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,428
All right.
Have a good one.

417
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,746
What are you doing here?
It's 8:00 a.m.

418
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:10,921
I'm in the shitter, Martha. I gotta be
in court by 2:00 and I'm really behind.

419
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:15,220
Do me a favor. Cancel everything
and call Drimmer. Tell him we're fine.

420
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:18,758
- I'll be there by 2:00.
- At 2:00? Okay.

421
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:20,896
Good morning, Martha.

422
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:30,196
- Daddy!
- Hey, honey! Oh, God, I missed you.

423
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:34,740
We had a great time. We went for a walk
with Grandpa and saw rabbits.

424
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:37,674
Well, good. Why don't you slow down.
I can't understand a word you're saying.

425
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,949
- Daddy, I want a rabbit.
- I know you do, honey.

426
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:42,713
- Hi, darling. How are you?
- Good.

427
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:51,961
Oh, God, I missed you.

428
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,395
Liar.

429
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,090
I did.

430
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:00,265
I should go away more often.

431
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:13,483
- I did this one.
- You did?

432
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:16,486
- Pick another one.
- I thought it was this row you picked.

433
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:19,648
- It was this one.
- I think you're in a lot of trouble.

434
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,624
Phooey. I can't do it.

435
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,636
Now pick a card, Dad.

436
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:44,913
Any card at all?

437
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:46,607
- Of course.
- Where'd she learn this?

438
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,951
Grandpa showed me.

439
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:52,613
It's a surprise.

440
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:58,289
So, how was it?

441
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:03,966
Come on. I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

442
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,594
It had a place for rabbits.

443
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:11,200
Oh, no! She said it.
She said the "R" word.

444
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:16,137
Not rabbits? Rabbits?

445
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:24,349
Well, what can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.

446
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:26,579
In this row?

447
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:32,028
So, when are you gonna come up
and take a look at it?

448
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:34,394
- Just for the hell of it?
- In this row?

449
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,794
How about tomorrow morning?

450
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:41,332
- Daddy, which row?
- You mean it?

451
00:42:41,605 --> 00:42:44,335
If you can get me back
to the office by 1:00, yeah.

452
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:46,542
Which row, Dad?

453
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,703
It's in this row, sweetheart.

454
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:17,072
Honey?

455
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:19,200
Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.

456
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:26,582
Well?

457
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,551
Well, it's... it's okay.

458
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:32,588
What do you mean?
It's fantastic.

459
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:34,180
It's great.

460
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:38,094
Just think of all the money
we're gonna save not living in New York.

461
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:41,188
The local high school is excellent.
My own children went there.

462
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:44,600
- You see?
- This is a terrific area for kids.

463
00:43:44,668 --> 00:43:46,898
I'm sure it is.
Is it okay if I go upstairs?

464
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:50,072
- Go ahead. I'll wait for you down here.
- Thank you.

465
00:43:52,676 --> 00:43:54,610
You know,
we still gotta decorate.

466
00:43:54,678 --> 00:43:57,545
We can fix up anything.
We can have painting parties.

467
00:43:57,681 --> 00:44:00,809
Painting parties?
Beth, you're making me very nervous.

468
00:44:07,691 --> 00:44:10,489
Now look at this.
This is fantastic.

469
00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:14,163
This would make a terrific playroom.

470
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:18,134
What are you talking about playroom?
This is my den. It's a den.

471
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:20,670
I knew you were gonna like it.

472
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,232
I like it.

473
00:44:37,721 --> 00:44:39,655
I'll be in court.
How you doing, Dan?

474
00:44:39,723 --> 00:44:41,918
Hi, Eunice.
Did Martha get back from lunch?

475
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:45,127
- She just returned.
- Thank you.

476
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,300
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area.

477
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:02,439
No. No. You...
Do you wanna come in my office?

478
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:21,026
You gonna be in your office later?
There's a little something... Excuse me.

479
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:23,699
- Haven't we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

480
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:26,327
She looked at me first.

481
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:31,331
Sit down.

482
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:48,087
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

483
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,590
I was gonna call you today.

484
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:00,702
This is terribly embarrassing.

485
00:46:00,804 --> 00:46:05,241
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

486
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:07,869
I had no right
to put you through that.

487
00:46:10,814 --> 00:46:12,748
Nothing happened, okay?

488
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:17,151
I was going through a bad time
and everything was coming to a crisis.

489
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:21,621
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.

490
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:25,693
- You don't have to thank me.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

491
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:28,230
A lot of guys
would have just run away.

492
00:46:28,832 --> 00:46:31,960
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.

493
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:36,636
Well, you... you look good.

494
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,104
As a matter of fact,
you look great.

495
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:41,142
Thanks.

496
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:45,679
So that's past?

497
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:52,788
- May I ask you one more favor?
- What's that?

498
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:58,158
<i>I've got two tickets
to Madame Butterfly... </i>

499
00:46:58,362 --> 00:47:01,195
two weeks from Thursday.

500
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:05,165
I'd really love it if you'd come
with me, kind of as a peace offering.

501
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,703
That's... That's very nice of you...

502
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,366
but I don't think it's a good idea.

503
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:15,707
No strings attached.

504
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:20,349
You don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.

505
00:47:22,886 --> 00:47:24,285
So...

506
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:30,360
I'll see you around sometime.

507
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,571
Come here.

508
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,782
Take care.

509
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:57,614
Good-bye.

510
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:29,612
Let's go, pal!

511
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:32,683
We're on a roll.
We're on a roll.

512
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:42,329
I like it.

513
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:43,365
Very nice.

514
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:03,350
That is no good.

515
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:34,381
How about Rodgers
versus whatchamacallit?

516
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:37,487
- Winitsky.
- Right. I got your memo.

517
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:39,819
- You gonna go for summary judgment?
- Why not, Arthur?

518
00:49:40,023 --> 00:49:43,550
The facts are not in dispute. Rodgers
admits reading Winitsky's article.

519
00:49:44,027 --> 00:49:46,461
The question is whether
he plagiarized it in his book.

520
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,761
You can't copyright an idea,
only the expression of the idea...

521
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:53,469
and Rodgers sure as hell didn't use
any of the words in the book.

522
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:55,471
Let me think about it.

523
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,837
So, I hear you're about
to become a suburbanite.

524
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,975
We're gonna take the big plunge.

525
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:02,534
- Got a buyer for the apartment?
- No.

526
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:05,981
- Got cold sweats about your escrow?
- Yeah.

527
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:08,483
But not about Rodgers
versus Winitsky?

528
00:50:08,552 --> 00:50:10,816
- No, sir.
- Good.

529
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,852
He's still in a meeting.

530
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:17,288
Yes, I know. I did expect him
to be through by now.

531
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:24,033
I'd like you to have lunch with me
on Tuesday, if you're around.

532
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,592
Thank you, Arthur. That'd be great.
Let me just check my diary.

533
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,005
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex Forest.

534
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:33,509
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.

535
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:35,511
- I did.
- Put her on hold.

536
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:37,376
Would you mind holding?

537
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:40,015
- Tuesday would be great.
- I look forward to it.

538
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,983
Thank you. I will too.

539
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:45,315
Put her through.

540
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:58,226
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed
this was not a good idea.

541
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:03,504
Why?

542
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,511
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

543
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:12,548
If I misled you in some way,
I apologize.

544
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:15,915
But I don't think it's a good idea
if we talk to each other anymore.

545
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:17,518
Okay?

546
00:51:19,122 --> 00:51:20,521
Good-bye.

547
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,326
If she calls again,
tell her I'm not here.

548
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,191
Thank you.

549
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:18,642
Wait. Let me do something.

550
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:20,974
Let me just look at you.

551
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:25,649
You're so beautiful.

552
00:52:25,922 --> 00:52:28,186
You're just so beautiful.

553
00:52:40,937 --> 00:52:43,303
- Wouldn't you know.
- I know.

554
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:57,716
Do you know how many injuries can...

555
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,855
- That's my wife!
- Don't terrorize them.

556
00:52:59,923 --> 00:53:02,391
I'm a lawyer. I'm insured.

557
00:53:02,926 --> 00:53:04,826
Oh, it's excited.

558
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,795
Now don't forget who gave you this.

559
00:53:06,897 --> 00:53:09,331
My cold sores are almost gone.

560
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:12,095
This is for you. Ladies first.
I use that term advisedly.

561
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:15,370
You bet, sweetie.

562
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:18,772
That's my wife!
A little attention, please.

563
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:21,376
Ladies. Gentleman.

564
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:23,913
My wife.
My little ball and chain.

565
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:26,882
- You should have such a ball and chain.
- Mother of some of my children.

566
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:31,387
- Wouldn't be that confident about it.
- Here is to Miller, Goodman...

567
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:33,821
Hurst and Gallagher.

568
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,392
- Here's to Mrs. Gallagher.
- Give me a break, will you, guys?

569
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:39,326
All he did was ask me to lunch.

570
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:42,364
Your moving to your country estate.
You'll forget you ever knew us.

571
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,900
Wait a minute.
I read one of those self-help books.

572
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:47,266
Published by Robbins and Hart,
of course.

573
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:49,496
<i>Samurai Self-Help. </i>

574
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:58,380
In it, it tells you how to deal
with the anxieties of your friends...

575
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:01,781
as you move up the corporate ladder
and they stay put...

576
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:03,384
or, God forbid, go down.

577
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:07,617
And in this book, it tells you
not to coddle your friends' anxieties.

578
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:10,927
So I'm not gonna make
any false reassurances, guys.

579
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:13,792
I'm not gonna tell you you're gonna be
up to the house every weekend.

580
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:17,398
Let's face it. Things have changed.
This is not a classless society.

581
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:21,403
As a matter of fact, this is it.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

582
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:24,440
I knew he was gonna say that.
The man is running true to form.

583
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:26,703
Honey, I think we gotta make
a clean break.

584
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,706
We're on a roll.
We gotta travel light.

585
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:31,981
Thanks for the time you've given us.

586
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:43,288
Here, you, drink. I want you
with a lamp shade on your head by 10:00.

587
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:46,325
Why should today be any different
from any other?

588
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:54,594
Here's to you.

589
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:53,859
Yeah, Richards.
It's kind of late, isn't it?

590
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,797
If you refuse to take my phone calls
at the office, you leave me no choice.

591
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:05,541
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Can't this wait till tomorrow morning?

592
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:07,440
Is it awkward for you to talk?

593
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:11,945
You could say that.

594
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:14,549
I've gotta see you.

595
00:56:14,618 --> 00:56:16,347
I don't have the...

596
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:21,318
the documentation to answer that right
now, but I'll call you from the office.

597
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:26,926
No. Meet me in front of the Robbins
and Hart building tomorrow, 6:00.

598
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,894
Don't disappoint me.

599
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,566
Be there.

600
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:41,842
- This has gotta stop.
- If you saw me, I wouldn't call.

601
00:56:42,145 --> 00:56:44,579
Do you get it? It's over.
There's nothing between us.

602
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:47,583
You mean you've had your fun.
Now you just want a quiet life.

603
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,516
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

604
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:51,553
- You need help.
- Don't tell me what I need.

605
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:53,589
You need a shrink!

606
00:56:53,657 --> 00:56:55,989
Why are you so hostile?
I'm not your enemy.

607
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:59,617
- Then why are you trying to hurt me?
- I'm not. I love you.

608
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:01,756
- You what?
- I love you.

609
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:06,227
- You don't even know me.
- How can you say that?

610
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,570
We spent a weekend together,
that's all.

611
00:57:08,672 --> 00:57:10,606
You stayed that second night.
You must like me a little.

612
00:57:10,674 --> 00:57:14,269
Because I was concerned about you.
Why do you read so much into everything?

613
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:18,114
Can't you understand? I have
a whole relationship with someone else.

614
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:19,580
I am very happy.

615
00:57:19,683 --> 00:57:21,651
Whole means complete.

616
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:24,119
If your life's so damn complete,
what were you doing with me?

617
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:28,089
- Is that what you wanna talk about?
- I'm pregnant.

618
00:57:32,696 --> 00:57:35,460
I saw my gynecologist on Monday.

619
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:37,792
Here's his card.
You can call him.

620
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:46,073
You don't...

621
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:50,111
Use anything?

622
00:57:51,214 --> 00:57:55,048
I had a very bad miscarriage last year.
I didn't think I could get pregnant.

623
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,814
How do you know it's mine?

624
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:04,717
Because I don't sleep around.

625
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,297
I apologize.

626
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:21,904
I'm sorry.

627
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:24,679
Don't worry. You're not gonna
have to handle this alone.

628
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:27,080
Handle what?

629
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,413
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.

630
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:33,484
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

631
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:40,195
You're not gonna have the baby.

632
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:42,094
Why not?

633
00:58:42,265 --> 00:58:44,665
There are plenty
of one-parent families.

634
00:58:44,768 --> 00:58:48,204
- At least they don't end in divorce.
- I don't have a say in this?

635
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:50,933
I want this child.

636
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:55,210
It has nothing to do with you. I want it
whether you're a part of it or not.

637
00:58:55,278 --> 00:58:59,180
Then why are you telling me?
Why not just go ahead and do it?

638
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:04,685
I was hoping that you would want
to be a part of it.

639
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:09,122
This is crazy.
This is totally insane.

640
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:12,489
I'm 36 years old. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

641
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,894
Just think what you're saying.

642
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:22,237
Just think about it.

643
00:59:22,305 --> 00:59:27,140
We are gonna live with this
for the rest of our lives.

644
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,210
I know that.

645
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:32,748
I've thought of that.
I know how you feel.

646
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:36,775
It's a big thing,
but it doesn't have to be a problem.

647
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,879
Really, it doesn't.

648
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:42,314
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.

649
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:51,699
"He led Agnes and Nellie
into the hall closet and shut the door.

650
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:54,862
Agnes and Nellie and Oink giggled
and laughed in the dark.

651
00:59:55,271 --> 00:59:57,205
Pearl listened outside the door.

652
00:59:57,273 --> 00:59:59,104
'Oh, it works, ' cried Nellie.

653
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:00,742
'Of course, ' said Oink.

654
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:02,711
'Look at the flying dog, '
yelled Agnes.

655
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:04,474
'Wow! ' cried Nellie.

656
01:00:05,215 --> 01:00:08,480
Pearl frowned. 'Who cares
about flying dogs? ' she said.

657
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:10,686
Nobody heard her.

658
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,654
'Look out for the worms! '
squealed Agnes.

659
01:00:12,722 --> 01:00:15,054
'Eeek! ' yelled Nellie
and Agnes together.

660
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:18,388
'Look at the monster cockroach! '
yelled Oink.

661
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,754
'Help!"'

662
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,294
So you know what I did?
I called the doctor.

663
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:08,762
You know what he says?
"Congratulations."

664
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:11,993
I can't even imagine
what she told him.

665
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:14,895
Anyway, that's not the end of it.

666
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:18,340
After I talk to the doctor...

667
01:03:18,374 --> 01:03:21,605
this morning
I broke into her apartment.

668
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:25,109
I know. Me, a lawyer,
breaking and entering.

669
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:28,316
I'm looking for something, anything to
get a handle on what I'm dealing with.

670
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:32,286
I thought maybe I could find out
she was sleeping with somebody else.

671
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:34,913
Well, I didn't find anything.

672
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:42,159
Anyway, I didn't find anything.

673
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,835
Jimmy, I don't know anything
about family law.

674
01:03:46,903 --> 01:03:50,031
You gotta help me.
What kind of case does she really have?

675
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,936
It ain't good.

676
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:00,314
She keeps calling the apartment.

677
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:04,443
Every time Beth answers the phone,
she hangs up.

678
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:09,756
I'm scared, Jimmy. I...

679
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:12,053
I don't wanna lose my family.

680
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:23,372
<i>The facts, as alleged, 
are horrendous. </i>

681
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:26,306
<i>The instrument allegedly used
in all three cases... </i>

682
01:04:26,442 --> 01:04:29,104
<i>was an electronic shock device
or stun gun... </i>

683
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:48,020
<i>Operator. May I help you? </i>

684
01:04:48,464 --> 01:04:52,901
Operator, I've been trying
to get 555-8129. 212?

685
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:57,338
<i>- Recording says it's been disconnected.
- Just a moment, please. </i>

686
01:04:57,473 --> 01:04:59,464
<i>I'm sorry, the number's been
changed to an unlisted number. </i>

687
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:02,410
Operator, this is a real emergency.
You need to give me that number.

688
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:04,469
<i>I'm sorry. We're not allowed
to give out that information. </i>

689
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,212
<i>- Well, fuck you!
- My place or yours? </i>

690
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:48,923
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- Well, we've been very happy here.

691
01:05:49,025 --> 01:05:51,186
I'd definitely like
to think about it, if I could.

692
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,463
- It's so clean.
- Yes.

693
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:58,932
We have a cleaning lady who comes in
a couple times a week.

694
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:02,470
- I can certainly give you her name.
- I'd love that.

695
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:05,268
And there's baby-sitters galore.
The whole works.

696
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:08,874
Whatever information you would need.
You know, they have...

697
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:15,950
Hi, darling.
Darling, this is Alex.

698
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:18,384
- I've forgotten your last name.
- Alex Forest.

699
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:24,792
Hi. Glad to meet you.

700
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:27,227
Nice to meet you.

701
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:32,300
Haven't we met somewhere before?

702
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:33,733
I don't think so, no.

703
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:40,799
We have.
Weren't you at that party...

704
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:42,777
at the Japanese place
a few weeks ago?

705
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:45,779
Honey, the exercise book.

706
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:47,315
Oh, yeah.

707
01:06:47,383 --> 01:06:51,376
You're a lawyer and you work
for the firm of...

708
01:06:51,854 --> 01:06:56,814
What's the name?
Well, anyway, we've definitely met.

709
01:06:56,893 --> 01:06:58,827
Well, you have a good memory.

710
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:00,692
I never forget a face.

711
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:02,489
It's a small world.

712
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:05,433
It certainly is.

713
01:07:07,403 --> 01:07:09,564
So, I gather
you're going to the country?

714
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:13,332
- Moving to the country?
- Yes.

715
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:16,469
- Have you found a place yet?
- We found a place in Bedford.

716
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,780
- Do you know it up there?
- Oh, it's beautiful, yes.

717
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:22,849
I guess you'll be moving
out of here almost immediately?

718
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:26,355
Actually, we wanted to do
some remodeling first.

719
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:28,822
I guess you're looking for a place
right away, aren't you?

720
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:31,086
Well, yeah,
I'd kind of like to settle in.

721
01:07:31,427 --> 01:07:33,759
Alex is expecting a baby.

722
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:38,366
Oh, that's...

723
01:07:38,935 --> 01:07:41,904
Will you excuse me?
I have some work I've got to do.

724
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:45,134
I better run too.

725
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:48,877
Thank you for the tea
and showing me the apartment.

726
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:51,413
- You're very welcome.
- I like it.

727
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:54,473
- I really like it.
- We've been very happy here.

728
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:56,851
I'd like to think about it,
if I could.

729
01:07:56,953 --> 01:07:59,387
Let me give you our number
so you can call us direct.

730
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:01,013
Thank you.

731
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:21,068
- I'll keep in touch.
- Great.

732
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:24,103
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.

733
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:30,919
She seemed really interested.

734
01:08:30,987 --> 01:08:32,887
It's funny.
She didn't mention a husband.

735
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:35,924
I get the feeling
that she's on her own.

736
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:38,620
- What is it? You seem down.
- No, I'm just tired.

737
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,880
<i>- Hello? 
- Hi, it's me.</i>

738
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:03,451
<i>Who? </i>

739
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:07,182
You know damn well who it is.
Let me in. I wanna talk.

740
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,423
<i>So now you wanna talk? </i>

741
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:30,376
So, what can I get you?
I've got scotch, vodka.

742
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:34,004
- I've got a nice chablis...
- Cut the shit, will you?

743
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,608
Just cut it!

744
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:40,989
I don't know what you're up to...

745
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:42,957
but I'm gonna tell you
it's gonna stop right now.

746
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:44,992
No, it's not gonna stop.
It's gonna go on and on...

747
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:46,961
until you face up
to your responsibilities.

748
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:48,757
What responsibilities?

749
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:52,000
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to have our child.

750
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:55,504
That's your choice, honey.
That has nothing to do with me.

751
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:57,471
I just wanna be
a part of your life.

752
01:09:58,074 --> 01:10:00,508
This is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

753
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:02,510
What am I supposed to do?
You won't answer my calls.

754
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:06,378
You change your number.
I'm not going to be ignored!

755
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:12,384
You don't get it.
You just... You don't get it.

756
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,615
Don't you remember our weekend?

757
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:20,062
I mean, wasn't that wonderful?

758
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:22,360
Why can't we just
be like that again?

759
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:27,035
I know you feel it too.
I mean, what are you so afraid of?

760
01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:29,003
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

761
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:33,541
Go ahead, hit me.
If you can't fuck me, just hit me.

762
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:36,578
You're so sad. Do you know that?
You're lonely and very sad.

763
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:39,775
Don't you ever pity me,
you smug bastard.

764
01:10:40,015 --> 01:10:42,575
I'll pity you,
because you're sick.

765
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:45,552
Why? Because I won't allow you
to treat me like some slut...

766
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:48,715
you can just bang a couple times
and throw in the garbage?

767
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:55,555
I'm gonna be
the mother of your child.

768
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:57,599
I want a little respect.

769
01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:03,037
You want respect?

770
01:11:06,142 --> 01:11:08,269
- Respect.
- What are you doing?

771
01:11:08,677 --> 01:11:11,578
Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

772
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,580
I'll tell your wife.

773
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:18,620
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.

774
01:11:21,157 --> 01:11:23,125
It only takes a phone call!

775
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:32,498
<i>Hello? Hello? </i>

776
01:11:42,178 --> 01:11:45,306
Guys, that's on the second door
to the left all the way in the landing.

777
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:47,774
Thank you.

778
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,118
You could have stayed
in the apartment.

779
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:52,120
Dan was in such a hurry
to get out of New York.

780
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:54,918
Mama, that's you, isn't it?

781
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:57,125
Oh, Lord, put it away.

782
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:59,593
All right, easy on that door frame.

783
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:02,459
Nice, nice.
Just like a glove.

784
01:12:18,113 --> 01:12:20,581
I got it. Sorry.

785
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:31,454
Hello? Martha.

786
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:38,564
It's Martha.

787
01:12:58,787 --> 01:13:01,551
Hi, honey. How you doing?
Did the plumber come yet?

788
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:04,556
Did he ever.

789
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:09,698
I don't really wanna know about it.
Guess what I'm looking at.

790
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:13,030
<i>- You got it? 
- Yeah, I got it right here.</i>

791
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:15,669
Or I should say, I got her.

792
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:17,500
What's she like?

793
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:20,207
Well, she's cute.
She looks like a rabbit.

794
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:23,939
She's white, long ears,
little pink eyes.

795
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:29,748
Ellen doesn't know
anything about it?

796
01:13:29,985 --> 01:13:33,352
No, she doesn't think
she's gonna get one.

797
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:35,356
See what happens if
you work here too long, Eunice?

798
01:13:35,424 --> 01:13:37,358
- Isn't she cute.
- Thank you.

799
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:40,418
Oh, I forgot.
This arrived for you.

800
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,398
- Good night, Eunice.
- Good night, Mr. Gallagher.

801
01:13:56,946 --> 01:13:58,743
Hey, Joaquin!

802
01:15:46,455 --> 01:15:48,946
Jesus fucking Christ!

803
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:52,585
Fucking bitch!
Jesus Christ.

804
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:01,002
It had something to do
with the electrical system.

805
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:04,005
The whole goddamn thing blew up.
A lot of smoke.

806
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,132
All right, honey,
I'll see you in a little while.

807
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:28,621
Mr. Gallagher?
You forgot your contract.

808
01:17:36,131 --> 01:17:39,100
<i>Hello, Dan. 
Are you surprised? </i>

809
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:42,865
<i>This is what you've reduced me to. </i>

810
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:45,038
<i>I guess you thought
you'd get away with it. </i>

811
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,040
<i>Well, you can't. </i>

812
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:51,807
<i>Because part of you
is growing inside of me... </i>

813
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:55,014
<i>and that's a fact, Dan, 
and you'd better start... </i>

814
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,482
<i>learning how to deal with it. </i>

815
01:18:01,156 --> 01:18:04,853
<i>'Cause, you know, I feel you. </i>

816
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,563
<i>I taste you. 
I think you. </i>

817
01:18:09,665 --> 01:18:11,223
<i>I touch you. </i>

818
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:15,102
<i>Can you understand? </i>

819
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,728
<i>Can you? </i>

820
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:21,165
<i>I'm just asking you... </i>

821
01:18:21,677 --> 01:18:25,579
<i>to acknowledge
your responsibilities. </i>

822
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:28,149
<i>Is that so bad? </i>

823
01:18:28,183 --> 01:18:30,083
<i>I don't think so. </i>

824
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:33,052
<i>I don't think it's unreasonable. </i>

825
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:35,622
<i>And, you know, 
another thing is that... </i>

826
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:40,754
<i>you thought you could just
walk into my life... </i>

827
01:18:41,196 --> 01:18:42,629
<i>and turn it upside down... </i>

828
01:18:42,698 --> 01:18:45,462
<i>without a thought
for anyone but yourself. </i>

829
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:12,160
<i>You know what you are, Dan? </i>

830
01:19:12,227 --> 01:19:15,162
<i>You're a cock-sucking
son of a bitch. </i>

831
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:20,190
<i>I hate you. I bet
you don't even like girls, do you? </i>

832
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:22,999
<i>You flaming, fucking faggot. </i>

833
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:17,851
Daddy! Thank you!

834
01:20:24,232 --> 01:20:26,564
Like it?

835
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:24,024
<i>You thought you could just
walk into my life... </i>

836
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:26,026
<i>and turn it upside down... </i>

837
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:29,029
<i>without a thought
for anyone but yourself. </i>

838
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:31,190
<i>You know what you are, Dan? </i>

839
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,661
<i>You're a cock-sucking
son of a bitch. </i>

840
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:39,039
<i>You are. </i>

841
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:41,905
<i>I bet you don't
even like girls, do you? </i>

842
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,544
<i>They probably scare you. </i>

843
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:46,513
<i>I know I do. </i>

844
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:49,880
<i>So you're scared of me, aren't you? </i>

845
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:53,087
<i>You're fucking frightened of me. 
You're afraid. </i>

846
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:56,113
<i>You're afraid, aren't you? 
You gutless, heartless... </i>

847
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,559
<i>spineless fucking son of a bitch. </i>

848
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:01,721
<i>I hate you. 
You deserve everything you get... </i>

849
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:05,531
Sorry.

850
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:08,569
I was wondering what you
were doing up so late.

851
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,537
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

852
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,575
It's okay. I was just listening
to a deposition and couldn't sleep.

853
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:17,544
Come on.
I'm gonna give you a back rub.

854
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:20,740
- A back rub?
- Brandy, a back rub.

855
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:23,549
You won't know what hit you.

856
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:25,210
Sounds good.

857
01:22:29,658 --> 01:22:32,024
<i>My client wants it stopped. </i>

858
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:35,596
<i>Hejust wants an end
to the harassment. </i>

859
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:38,360
<i>He's positive it was this woman
who trashed the car? </i>

860
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,600
Yes, of course.

861
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:43,763
- Any witnesses?
- No.

862
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:48,108
He's welcome to file a complaint,
if it'd make him feel better.

863
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:50,872
There's not a lot you can do
without proof.

864
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:53,943
Look, Lieutenant, this woman
is completely irrational.

865
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:55,915
There's no telling
what she could do.

866
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:59,051
We can't go around arresting people
for what they might do. You know that.

867
01:22:59,187 --> 01:23:03,715
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
He simply...

868
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:09,095
He wants her warned.

869
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,964
Well, we could talk to her.

870
01:23:14,202 --> 01:23:17,035
It may make things public.
He's not gonna like that.

871
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:20,130
It may even aggravate
the situation with the girl.

872
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,732
How's that?

873
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:26,146
Whatever resentment she's feeling,
she probably got it out of her system.

874
01:23:26,214 --> 01:23:29,115
And any action we take
could provoke her.

875
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,051
What if she didn't get it
out of her system? What then?

876
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:38,124
You have to catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.

877
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:41,252
Well, you say he just has to
sit there and take it?

878
01:23:41,663 --> 01:23:45,360
It's his bed. Afraid
he's gonna have to lie in it.

879
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:59,145
Come on.

880
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:13,193
Come on, Ellen.
We're going to Grandma's.

881
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:20,792
Come on, Quince.
Quincy, come on. Hurry up.

882
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:23,703
Come on. Get on in.
Hurry up.

883
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:26,263
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.

884
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:43,722
See you didn't get your car back.

885
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:47,125
No, it's a total write-off.
The electrical system's just shot.

886
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:50,025
Extraordinary, those foreign cars.

887
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:52,232
- Here you are, dear.
- Oh, thank you.

888
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,167
- Wanna try again, sweetie?
- Okay.

889
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:58,739
Okay. So?

890
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:04,643
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

891
01:25:05,313 --> 01:25:06,746
Very good.

892
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:10,683
You wanna do it one more time.
Do it with your hat and do the bow.

893
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,549
So when you actually do it,
you know what you're doing.

894
01:25:13,888 --> 01:25:15,788
Let me see your bow.

895
01:25:18,393 --> 01:25:19,724
And what do you say?

896
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:25,095
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

897
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:26,732
Very good.

898
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:29,894
Come here.

899
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:34,274
That was good.

900
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:37,106
- Thank you.
- That was really good.

901
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:39,245
That was so good.

902
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,785
- I love you.
- I love you too.

903
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:46,411
Thank you, darling.

904
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:12,437
Come on, Quincy.

905
01:27:36,731 --> 01:27:37,959
Daddy!

906
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:39,658
What?

907
01:27:43,171 --> 01:27:44,331
Whitey's gone!

908
01:28:07,695 --> 01:28:11,563
It's all right, darling.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

909
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:13,929
You should try to get some sleep.

910
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:42,355
- She okay?
- She's asleep.

911
01:28:45,733 --> 01:28:48,167
- Did you call the police?
- Not yet, no.

912
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:49,464
Why not?

913
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:55,402
Honey, we gotta talk.

914
01:29:03,251 --> 01:29:05,276
What is it?

915
01:29:06,754 --> 01:29:08,722
I know who did this.

916
01:29:10,758 --> 01:29:11,986
You do?

917
01:29:12,727 --> 01:29:13,989
Who?

918
01:29:14,262 --> 01:29:16,423
Remember the girl who...

919
01:29:16,764 --> 01:29:19,198
came to the apartment?

920
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:22,202
The one I met
in the Japanese restaurant?

921
01:29:24,272 --> 01:29:26,832
The one with the blond hair.

922
01:29:34,282 --> 01:29:35,943
You're scaring me.

923
01:29:41,789 --> 01:29:44,223
What is it?

924
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:46,487
Did you have an affair with her?

925
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:48,923
Yes.

926
01:30:09,851 --> 01:30:11,751
I am so sorry.

927
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:18,588
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was to hurt you.

928
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:28,063
Are you in love with her?

929
01:30:29,837 --> 01:30:34,069
No, it was one night.
It didn't mean anything.

930
01:30:44,852 --> 01:30:49,448
What has it got to do
with what's happened?

931
01:30:53,861 --> 01:30:55,123
She's pregnant.

932
01:30:57,365 --> 01:31:01,324
She's... It's yours?

933
01:31:01,869 --> 01:31:05,828
I don't know. That's what she says.
Honey, listen to me.

934
01:31:06,441 --> 01:31:08,306
Get out!
I want you out of here!

935
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:10,571
I want you out of this house,
and I want you out now!

936
01:31:10,878 --> 01:31:12,778
How could you do this?
I hate you!

937
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:16,317
- Honey, you don't understand.
- I don't wanna hear it!

938
01:31:16,384 --> 01:31:19,319
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Please, just listen to me.

939
01:31:19,387 --> 01:31:20,854
Please, please, listen.

940
01:31:21,389 --> 01:31:23,289
What is the matter with you?

941
01:32:33,961 --> 01:32:36,429
Dan. What a pleasant surprise.

942
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:41,458
It's over, Alex. It's all finished.
I told Beth. She knows all about it.

943
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:47,236
<i>Sure. 
You haven't got the balls. </i>

944
01:32:47,475 --> 01:32:49,602
Why don't you speak to her.

945
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:53,947
Why would I wanna talk to her?

946
01:33:05,993 --> 01:33:07,927
This is Beth Gallagher.

947
01:33:07,995 --> 01:33:11,590
If you ever come near my family again,
I'll kill you. You understand?

948
01:33:39,026 --> 01:33:41,893
That's the last one.
I mean it.

949
01:33:59,547 --> 01:34:01,481
Hello?

950
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:03,107
Hi, Daddy.

951
01:34:05,553 --> 01:34:07,851
When are you coming home?

952
01:34:11,559 --> 01:34:16,087
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?

953
01:34:16,564 --> 01:34:18,122
Good.

954
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:28,506
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.

955
01:34:28,576 --> 01:34:31,374
Oh, did he?
The one with the jacks?

956
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:33,979
No, the one with kings.

957
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,141
Good.

958
01:34:40,588 --> 01:34:42,215
I won't.

959
01:34:44,592 --> 01:34:46,150
Good.

960
01:34:50,097 --> 01:34:54,693
How's Mommy?
Send her my love?

961
01:34:55,102 --> 01:34:57,536
Okay. Good-bye.

962
01:34:57,605 --> 01:34:59,800
Daddy?

963
01:35:00,107 --> 01:35:02,575
Call me tomorrow.

964
01:35:03,611 --> 01:35:05,044
I will. I promise.

965
01:35:05,112 --> 01:35:07,080
You be sure
you tell Mommy I called?

966
01:35:07,615 --> 01:35:10,049
I will.

967
01:35:10,117 --> 01:35:11,982
Love you a lot too.

968
01:36:01,168 --> 01:36:03,898
Hi, Mrs. Gallagher.
Did you forget something?

969
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:06,105
- I came to get Ellen.
- Ellen?

970
01:36:06,173 --> 01:36:08,073
I thought you picked her up already.

971
01:36:09,176 --> 01:36:11,076
Well, I'm sure
she's left already.

972
01:36:12,513 --> 01:36:15,107
Betty, is Ellen in here with you?

973
01:36:15,182 --> 01:36:17,082
- She's gone home already.
- Are you sure?

974
01:36:17,184 --> 01:36:19,618
I'm positive. She's not inside
and she's not in the playground.

975
01:36:19,687 --> 01:36:22,747
- I thought you picked her up.
- Who did pick her up?

976
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:25,090
Don't worry.
She can't have gone far.

977
01:36:26,193 --> 01:36:28,491
- You don't understand.
- I'll check her locker.

978
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:35,635
Alicia, where's Ellen?

979
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:37,068
She's gone.

980
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:41,402
Call the police!

981
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:52,280
Please let her be all right.
Please.

982
01:36:54,221 --> 01:36:55,518
Oh, Christ.

983
01:37:00,127 --> 01:37:01,788
Where are you?

984
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:27,370
Where are you?

985
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,104
- Bye-bye, Ellen.
- Bye.

986
01:38:57,845 --> 01:38:59,210
Can I have a kiss?

987
01:39:14,862 --> 01:39:16,796
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a patient named Gallagher.

988
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,354
I'm her husband.

989
01:39:18,866 --> 01:39:21,300
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.

990
01:39:21,368 --> 01:39:24,303
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

991
01:39:24,371 --> 01:39:27,306
She was very lucky.
It might've been a lot worse.

992
01:39:27,374 --> 01:39:29,205
Thank you.
Hi, baby.

993
01:39:29,376 --> 01:39:32,834
Oh, God, I missed you.
I missed you, honey.

994
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:36,315
Are you okay?
Did you see Mommy yet?

995
01:39:36,383 --> 01:39:38,317
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

996
01:39:38,385 --> 01:39:40,876
You stay here with Granny.
I'm gonna go see Mommy.

997
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:11,817
You're gonna be okay.

998
01:45:06,013 --> 01:45:08,447
I came in before.
I tried to explain the situation.

999
01:45:08,515 --> 01:45:10,574
You didn't wanna listen to me.
Now, the woman took my kid.

1000
01:45:11,018 --> 01:45:13,452
That's kidnapping, right?
Am I right?

1001
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,681
My wife's in the hospital.
She could've been killed.

1002
01:45:16,023 --> 01:45:19,982
- If you're not gonna do something...
- Take it easy. You don't have to shout.

1003
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:25,691
Okay, what are you gonna do?

1004
01:45:26,533 --> 01:45:30,333
We'll tell New York to pick her up
and bring her in for questioning.

1005
01:45:35,042 --> 01:45:37,602
Okay, then I'm...

1006
01:45:38,045 --> 01:45:42,482
I'm gonna go to the hospital
tomorrow, pick my wife up.

1007
01:45:42,549 --> 01:45:45,416
And hopefully...

1008
01:45:45,552 --> 01:45:50,148
I'll be home for the weekend
if you need to talk to me.

1009
01:45:57,564 --> 01:45:59,122
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1010
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:05,004
You're welcome.

1011
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:26,218
How's that feel?
Good and warm?

1012
01:46:29,596 --> 01:46:33,362
- You all cozy?
- Is Mommy gonna be all right?

1013
01:46:34,434 --> 01:46:36,527
Mommy's gonna be fine, honey.

1014
01:46:36,603 --> 01:46:38,503
She's gonna be fine.

1015
01:46:39,106 --> 01:46:41,700
Are you going to stay with us?

1016
01:46:44,611 --> 01:46:46,704
I'm gonna stay with you, honey.

1017
01:46:50,117 --> 01:46:52,017
Now, you go to sleep, okay?

1018
01:46:55,622 --> 01:46:57,180
Good night, doll.

1019
01:46:59,626 --> 01:47:00,923
Forever?

1020
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:04,961
I promise, honey.

1021
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:30,021
You mean the detectives in Manhattan
have no idea where she's gone?

1022
01:47:30,157 --> 01:47:32,057
They don't know where she is?

1023
01:47:45,172 --> 01:47:47,606
No, I see.

1024
01:47:47,674 --> 01:47:50,370
If you get any more information,
be sure and let me know, Lieutenant.

1025
01:47:50,677 --> 01:47:53,009
Thank you very much, sir.
Good night.

1026
01:48:09,696 --> 01:48:12,756
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1027
01:48:13,233 --> 01:48:17,033
- How does the arm feel?
- It hurts.

1028
01:48:17,738 --> 01:48:19,865
I'll get you some more painkillers.

1029
01:48:44,264 --> 01:48:45,196
Thanks.

1030
01:48:45,265 --> 01:48:47,563
Now, you just holler if
you need anything else, all right?

1031
01:48:48,268 --> 01:48:50,702
I'd love a cup of tea.

1032
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:53,068
You got it.

1033
01:50:33,373 --> 01:50:35,637
What are you doing here?

1034
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:43,715
Why are you here?

1035
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:49,479
He tried...

1036
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:53,018
to say good-bye to me last night.

1037
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:56,827
But he couldn't because...

1038
01:50:56,897 --> 01:50:59,365
he and I feel
the same way about each other.

1039
01:51:03,403 --> 01:51:06,668
Do you know how it is when you
meet somebody for the first time?

1040
01:51:09,809 --> 01:51:13,074
And you get this instant attraction.

1041
01:51:21,922 --> 01:51:24,049
And don't you think
I understand what you're doing?

1042
01:51:24,424 --> 01:51:27,359
You're trying to move him
into the country...

1043
01:51:27,427 --> 01:51:29,895
and you're keeping him
away from me.

1044
01:51:31,998 --> 01:51:35,331
And you're playing happy family.

1045
01:51:35,402 --> 01:51:37,802
Aren't you?

1046
01:51:38,438 --> 01:51:42,272
You wouldn't understand that
because you're so selfish.

1047
01:51:45,946 --> 01:51:49,074
He told me about you.
He told me about you.

1048
01:51:49,349 --> 01:51:51,579
He was very honest.

1049
01:52:03,964 --> 01:52:05,397
If you weren't so stupid,
you'd know that.

1050
01:52:05,465 --> 01:52:08,434
But you're so stupid.
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!

1051
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:11,994
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!
