1
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,281
- Yes, mother?
- Jess, honey, why are you doing this?

2
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,450
- I've been through enough...
- Mom, seriously?

3
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,485
We've been through this
like a thousand times.

4
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,789
Do we really have to do this now?
I'm literally about to start my first shift.

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,233
Yeah, that's exactly why
we have to do this right now.

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,665
Mom, I told you I am going
to be fine, all right?

7
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,068
Most cops go their entire career
without seeing any action.

8
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,741
Yeah, well, tell that to your father.

9
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,043
Nice.

10
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:17,811
Look, Jess, for me, don't do this.
Hey, do you know what? I got a nice...

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,415
Mom, I'm gonna be really late, so I gotta...
Can we talk about this later?

12
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,285
Look, I need to talk about this right now.
I can't take this anymore.

13
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,186
No, because I'm gonna be late
and I'm going to be fired

14
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,656
before I even get through my first day
of work. But I love you. I love you.

15
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,867
Goodbye. Goodbye.

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,938
Hello?

17
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,664
Hello?

18
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,870
Anybody in here?

19
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,368
God!

20
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,435
Goddamn son of a bitch!

21
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,210
Fucking! Fucking cop!

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,914
Shit!

23
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,715
Hello?

24
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,753
How long have you been there?

25
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,123
- I just walked in. I'm Officer...
- Turn around!

26
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,330
- My order said to report...
- I said, turn around.

27
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:47,007
Stop! I said, turn around,
not walk away.

28
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,937
Sir...

29
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,968
- I'm Sergeant Cohen.
- Officer Loren.

30
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,366
- Loren?
- Yes, sir.

31
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,069
I... I was told to report here.
It might have been a mistake.

32
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,337
I thought the new station
is up and running already.

33
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,487
Yes, it is. And she's a fucking beauty!

34
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,376
Saint Michael himself
would be impressed.

35
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:33,630
And tomorrow when you see it you will
fall down upon its steps and weep.

36
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,437
But tonight you're here.

37
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,746
Sir...

38
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:43,306
I guess I don't understand
what I am doing here.

39
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:46,509
The real question is what the hell
am I still doing here?

40
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,125
But to answer yours,

41
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:53,886
you are the lucky rookie to work
the very last shift in this mausoleum.

42
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:01,992
All 911 calls have been rerouted
to the new station, so it should be quiet.

43
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:06,029
Okay, you may have some walk-ups,
but just send them up the street.

44
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,273
The address and my number
are on the wall.

45
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:13,304
If there's an emergency,
call the station.

46
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:23,886
Here's the kitchen, and the waiting room
down the hall if you get bored.

47
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,935
That's holding, you don't have
to go down there.

48
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:33,190
- Sarge, can I speak frankly?
- Sure.

49
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,409
Why am I here and not a security guard?

50
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:42,842
- Let's go, rookie!
- Yes, sir.

51
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,807
This room contains
enough hazardous material

52
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,910
to make Chernobyl look like
fucking bird shit on a windowsill.

53
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,947
Tonight, every hardened
criminal in this area

54
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,916
will do everything
in their power to get to this.

55
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:02,360
And you will be the only one standing
between them and the total annihilation

56
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,708
of this fucking city.

57
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,895
- I'm messing with you, rookie.
- Oh... I know.

58
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:16,466
It's not in the department's policy to hire
outside security when we have a whole fleet

59
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,902
- of blue boys on the payroll.
- Right.

60
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:22,072
The only things left in these cabins
are some needles,

61
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,040
some bloodstained, shit-stained clothes.

62
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,215
Basically all the vile crap that we collect
from perps and crime scenes

63
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:31,648
that have made their way through evidence
and we can't throw in the trash.

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,751
The material was supposed
to be disposed of yesterday

65
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,420
but for whatever reason it wasn't.

66
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,559
So, Hazmat's gonna be here sometime
between 10 PM and 4 AM.

67
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,761
Do not leave.

68
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,864
I repeat, do not leave the premises.

69
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,625
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

70
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,851
I'll be back to relieve you
when your shift is over.

71
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,819
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

72
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,436
Sanford Police Department.

73
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,162
Hello?

74
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,142
Help me.

75
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,468
I am trapped.

76
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:35,517
Miss... I am sorry,
you're... Are you injured?

77
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,483
The scream sound won't stop now.

78
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,211
Okay, ma'am, just stay calm.
What's your address?

79
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:46,292
I think they might all be dead.

80
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,920
All right, ma'am, just...
just give me your address

81
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,788
and I'll dispatch a unit
to your location.

82
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:55,656
Hello?

83
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,106
Ma'am?

84
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:02,283
Shit!

85
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,809
- Sanford Police Department.
- Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

86
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,578
I just received a distress call
at the old station.

87
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:19,883
It was a possible 10-54. I was told
all emergency calls were rerouted, so...

88
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:24,421
- All calls were rerouted.
- They weren't because I just received one.

89
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,738
Is the line still active?

90
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,767
No.

91
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,795
Were you able to obtain
any of the vic's information?

92
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:35,411
No, sir. The line was disconnected.

93
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:40,183
Hello?

94
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,873
I've documented the call
and I'll confirm on my end

95
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:45,186
that the lines have been
properly rerouted.

96
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:47,610
If there any issues, I'll let you know.

97
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,430
All right. All right, thank you.

98
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,607
Sergeant Cohen?

99
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,390
Sergeant Cohen is that you, sir?

100
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,691
Sir?

101
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:34,322
Sir, you have to leave
the station is closed.

102
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,063
Sir!

103
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:45,406
Sir, if you don't leave the station now
I'm gonna be forced to ta...

104
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,481
Son of a bitch.

105
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:09,960
Sir?

106
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,995
Sir, you know where you are?

107
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,869
Sir, you're in a police station.

108
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,102
Hey.

109
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:23,826
Hello?

110
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,837
- Shut up!
- Jesus Christ!

111
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:30,277
Move. Move!

112
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,620
Get out. Get out!

113
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:24,126
- Sanford Police Department.
- Please. I need to get out.

114
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,529
Hey, you called earlier, right?
What's your name?

115
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,550
- Monica.
- Monica, okay. Monica, where are you?

116
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,252
I was brought to a ranch.

117
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,335
A ranch, all right.
Do you know the address?

118
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,623
They're coming back.

119
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,376
Tell me quickly, is there anything around
that you can help me locate you?

120
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,333
- Anything that you see, what's near you?
- I don't know. I think...

121
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,183
I think I hear pigs.

122
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:50,699
Pigs? All right. Is there anything else?

123
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,888
I have to go.

124
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,824
Monica?

125
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,093
Damn it!

126
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:58,161
Monica?

127
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:01,664
I think I may have the wrong number.
This is Joe from Bioclean Waste Removal.

128
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:04,650
Oh, no, no, no. I am sorry. This is
Officer Loren. I was expecting you.

129
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,904
I just wanna give you a heads-up.
We're running a little behind, you know?

130
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,007
I thought we'd be there sooner
but we're dealing with quite a mess here.

131
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:14,810
Okay, so, what is it going
to be more like... four?

132
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,047
Yeah, you know, I'm not sure.
Maybe sooner but... I'll tell you what,

133
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:21,668
- I'll call you back if things change.
- All right, that's fine. Thank you, Joe.

134
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,695
- Sanford Police Department.
- Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

135
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:36,198
I'm calling again from the old station.
I keep receiving 911 calls.

136
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,868
- All calls have been rerouted.
- Yeah...

137
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,837
I know, I called earlier
to report the same issue.

138
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:45,341
- Are you receiving a high volume of calls?
- No, it's not a high volume of calls.

139
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,894
She's called twice. It's the same girl,
her name is Monica.

140
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,946
She's definitely in some kind of danger.
I can't get much information.

141
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,449
- Did you get her last name?
- Shit! No, I didn't.

142
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,152
But she said that she is on a ranch or some
kind of farm or something, there's pigs.

143
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:03,593
Okay, she's not dialing 911. So she has
to be dialing your station directly.

144
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:05,928
Okay. Well, can I trace
her calls from here?

145
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:08,430
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't trace
a call from that line

146
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,549
but I can start looking into the pigs.

147
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:15,119
- Alright, what do I do if she calls again?
- Tell her to call 911.

148
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:18,560
Got it. Thanks.

149
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,542
This is Officer Loren
at the old station.

150
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:08,911
I'm investigating a B and E.
Possible Code Nine.

151
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,093
Come again?

152
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:22,132
I repeat possible Code Nine.

153
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,780
"As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental
duty is to safeguard lives and property,

154
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,280
to protect the innocent
against deception,

155
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,682
the peaceful against violence,
or disorder,

156
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:51,568
and to respect the constitutional rights
of all to liberty, equality and justice."

157
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:15,912
Show me your hands!

158
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:18,800
Show me your hands. Do it now!

159
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,831
Shit!

160
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,165
Sir, you can't be in here.
This is a police station.

161
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:54,734
Take it easy.

162
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,310
Stay on the ground.

163
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,548
Move it.

164
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:23,049
Get in.

165
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:29,126
Get off your knees. Get off your knees!

166
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,213
What the fuck?

167
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,044
Hello?

168
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,290
If there's somebody out there
you need to open the door now.

169
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:32,114
You are interfering
with the duties of an officer.

170
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:35,897
You let me out now
and I'll only give you a warning.

171
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,332
Fuck!

172
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,053
Shit!

173
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:16,368
Sir, get back down on the ground.

174
00:26:31,073 --> 00:26:35,377
Sir, give me my flashlight
and get back down on the ground.

175
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:38,122
Let me remind you I am armed.

176
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,470
- Who is in here?
- I'm not ready to go.

177
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,960
- Who is in here?
- Please. Let me out of here.

178
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:10,896
Answer me.

179
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:20,222
Let me out.

180
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:22,464
Please open the door.

181
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:25,060
Don't be scared.

182
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,941
Do you want to get out of here alive?

183
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:37,251
- Who are you?
- I'm gonna hurt you.

184
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,734
Give me my flashlight.

185
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,453
"I will maintain courageous calm
in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule.

186
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:27,789
I'll develop self-restraint and...

187
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:30,359
and I'll develop self-restraint

188
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,228
and be constantly mindful
of the welfare of others.

189
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:36,265
I will be exemplary in obeying
the laws of the land

190
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:38,983
and the regulations of my department."

191
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,959
Screw it.

192
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:31,853
You've reached Sergeant Cohen.

193
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:34,337
Please leave a message.

194
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:39,706
Sergeant Cohen, this is Officer Loren
down at the old station.

195
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:43,217
There was a... I'm...

196
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:45,915
I am calling...

197
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,985
because I am...

198
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:53,283
I am calling because...

199
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:59,028
I am happy to be on the force, sir.

200
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:02,198
Thank you.

201
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,267
Ma'am, can I help you with something?

202
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,017
No, I'm all right.

203
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,421
Well, you can't hang out back here.
This is a police station.

204
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:15,941
No, it's not. Police station's
on 14th and Anderson.

205
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,192
- Ma'am?
- You can call me Marigold.

206
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:22,197
No, ma'am, I will not.

207
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,417
My mama gave me that name.
She picked it out herself, swear to God.

208
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,221
Can you please remove yourself
from the premises and...

209
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,363
go about your business?

210
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:41,833
Look... do you mind if I finish
my cigarette? It feels safer here.

211
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,044
All right, just don't leave
your butt on the step.

212
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,956
Hey!

213
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,524
You're new, right?

214
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,240
- Yeah.
- I thought so.

215
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:56,744
I can pick a rookie
out of a whole room full of pigs.

216
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:00,782
Well, you've still got that look
on your face like you give a damn.

217
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,255
Have a good night.

218
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,570
I was here, you know.

219
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:08,254
Yeah?

220
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:13,515
Well, the cell next door
but I heard the scream,

221
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,967
when they found him the next morning.

222
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:19,488
What...

223
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:20,972
what are you referring to?

224
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,912
When they brought them in that night
three of them,

225
00:32:24,012 --> 00:32:28,230
this wannabe Manson family.
I think they were called the Paymons.

226
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,233
Kidnapped and slaughtered
those poor girls.

227
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,768
Yes, they did.

228
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,606
They also killed the Paymon family
on the scene of the crime, the officers.

229
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,970
I should know,
my father was one of them.

230
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,589
That's what they wanted you to believe.
But they brought 'em in alive.

231
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:46,928
Bragging about what they'd done and all.

232
00:32:47,816 --> 00:32:49,084
I can see you don't believe me

233
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:52,567
but I am willing to bet my tits
and a pack of cigarettes, it's the truth.

234
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,348
Well, they kept me up all night...

235
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,202
singing this eerie song.

236
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,165
Then it just stopped.

237
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:23,764
Those crazy bastards hung themselves
with their own bed sheets.

238
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,956
And the commotion the next morning...

239
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,176
I got a glimpse into their cell.

240
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,407
And the bodies were gone.

241
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:35,577
But...

242
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:42,219
pure evil covered those walls.

243
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,730
You okay?

244
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,643
Yeah. No, I'm good.

245
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,215
Well, time to make the doughnuts.

246
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:12,387
And don't worry
I'm taking my butt with me.

247
00:35:08,657 --> 00:35:11,111
I'm not ashamed of what I do.

248
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:15,196
You ashamed of paying your taxes,
taking care of your kids, loving your wife?

249
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:18,400
I do what I do, because it's right.

250
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,736
You ever hit the girl right in the face
with a baseball bat?

251
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:23,572
We dress ourselves
in the cloak of ignorance...

252
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:26,556
She didn't even look
like people anymore.

253
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,877
Face swollen,

254
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:32,047
teeth knocked up inside her forehead.

255
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,582
It got me excited.

256
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:36,117
She fell to her knees
and bowed to the king.

257
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,133
Are you suggesting
we are devil worshippers?

258
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:44,076
Devil's just another bitch of the Lord.
Rebel angel that was cast out.

259
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,494
I am not ashamed.

260
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:50,699
But he is downstairs doing the Lord's
work just like the rest of them.

261
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:54,655
Punishing the damned for their sins.
That sounds like the Lord's work to me.

262
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:58,492
But the answer is no.

263
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,323
We don't pray to him.

264
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,780
Devil's been around long before that
clipped-wing cock-sucker got down there.

265
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,425
Who do you think was there before him?

266
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:12,487
He just took a break for a while.

267
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,834
Searching the world for pretty faces.

268
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,161
- Like me.
- Dead people are always so messy.

269
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,909
There's so much blood
splashing around in there.

270
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,070
Make a couple of holes and it just...

271
00:36:29,512 --> 00:36:31,581
pours out.

272
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:38,529
I once stabbed a girl
who sounded like a pig.

273
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:44,970
I once stabbed a girl
who sounded like a pig.

274
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:53,707
She fell to her knees
and bowed to the king.

275
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,113
That's what Paymon means, you know?

276
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:00,578
It was destined.

277
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,219
The king of hell.

278
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,141
There was a family back at the ranch.

279
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,293
But not at night...

280
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:11,978
not yet.

281
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,883
Paymon needs soldiers.

282
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,685
That's why we are heading home...

283
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:19,954
with guns blazing so he can take
his rightful place...

284
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:23,600
I am the dancing flame,

285
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,238
a lightning strike,

286
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,613
crippling away.

287
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:32,067
I'll destroy your homes.

288
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,869
The ones alive within your heart,

289
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,257
the ones you pray for.

290
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:41,643
I will rape your humanity...

291
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:46,327
until forgiveness
is what you seek from me.

292
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,096
I like you.

293
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,974
I will come back for you
and all you love.

294
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:56,536
Mark my words.

295
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,544
I like you.

296
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:05,149
I will come back for you
and all you love.

297
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:09,112
Mark my words. I like you.

298
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,389
This is Officer Loren.

299
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,691
- Monica?
- They're dead.

300
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,027
- Monica, is that you?
- They killed them.

301
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:08,563
Who is dead, honey? Who is dead?

302
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:10,665
The other girls.

303
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,980
What other girls?

304
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:17,820
- You've got to help me.
- Okay, Monica...

305
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,710
I can't do anything for you over here.
I need you to hang up and dial 911. Okay?

306
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,245
Can you do that for me?

307
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:27,299
They won't stop singing.

308
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:30,842
They keep singing that song.

309
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,299
What?

310
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,305
- Hello?
- I'm here.

311
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:54,042
I'm here. Monica, what's your last name?

312
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:59,780
- Young.
- Young? How old are you?

313
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,185
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen, okay.

314
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:09,290
Monica, I'm at a station that does not
have the ability to track your call.

315
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,661
- So I need you to hang up and call 911.
- Wait!

316
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,480
- They're coming.
- Okay. Okay.

317
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,900
Be very quiet and be very still and listen
to my voice. Are you listening to my voice?

318
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,306
I need you to go somewhere safe.
I need you to find somewhere,

319
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:25,406
- where you can call 911... 9...
- I can't.

320
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,543
Re-dial is all that's working.

321
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:30,812
Okay. Then you listen to me, Monica.

322
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:34,149
Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.
You need to get yourself to safety.

323
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:37,486
You need to find an opportunity to run
and you need to take it. You need to run.

324
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:40,622
- You need to run as soon as you can.
- Killing...

325
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:42,857
Okay. Listen. Listen. Listen.
I have a question for you.

326
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:46,995
Has anybody there mentioned the name,
John Michael Paymon?

327
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:50,198
Have you heard that name? Can you think
and tell me that? Has anybody asked you

328
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:51,366
- or have you heard the name,
- I don't know.

329
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:53,901
John Michael Paymon?

330
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,170
- I think so.
- You think so?

331
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,240
- Please help me!
- I'm gonna help you. I promise you.

332
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,387
Stay on the phone with me.
I'm gonna help you.

333
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,162
- Sanford Police Department.
- This is Officer Loren at the old station.

334
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,182
- Yup, we spoke earlier.
- Yeah, we did. I got her last name.

335
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:44,569
It's Young. Monica Young
and she is 17 years old.

336
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,154
Great. Anything else?

337
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,790
She is not able to dial 911
from her phone.

338
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,925
Also, she said that
there are other girls there,

339
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:54,996
she thinks they're dead and she said
her captors are singing a song.

340
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,342
Okay. A song? Is that it?

341
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:03,589
I think the remaining members
of the Paymon family might have her.

342
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:07,475
- Hello?
- Oh, I'm sorry, you're serious?

343
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:10,845
- I recognized the song.
- Okay, slow down, rookie.

344
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:15,726
Look, the Paymon family, they scattered
and they are under constant surveillance.

345
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:18,086
- Do you have a pen?
- Yes.

346
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:20,021
Write this down...

347
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:26,027
John-Victor-Ida-one-five-two-six-three.

348
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,295
Okay.

349
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:31,545
You get any more information you reference
that report number when you call back.

350
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,612
Okay.

351
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,020
Thanks.

352
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:40,948
Oh, my God!
You guys are fucking with me.

353
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:47,160
All right, enough you guys. You got me,
all right? The joke is on the rookie.

354
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:50,929
Real fucking funny.

355
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,609
Yeah, it's real fucking funny.

356
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,101
Come out, shit heads!

357
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:11,018
You guys are a bunch of fucking cowards.

358
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:12,333
Unbelievable.

359
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:17,649
You got me pretty good. I got to say,
you got me pretty, pretty good.

360
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:33,387
So?

361
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,266
So...

362
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:39,302
- What?
- Is it just you or are there others?

363
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,765
- No, it's just me.
- Well, that's real fucking mature.

364
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:47,835
I am... I'm not following you.

365
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:50,471
Is this like your thing?
Is this what you do with your friends?

366
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:53,074
You put every rookie
through this little fun house?

367
00:44:53,174 --> 00:44:56,777
Well... I don't think
that we are on the same page.

368
00:44:56,877 --> 00:45:00,567
I came over here to check on you.
I'm Officer Ryan Price.

369
00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:06,438
You're not...
you are not fucking with me?

370
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:11,377
No. I swear on my life.

371
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:13,673
Can I come in?

372
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:16,378
- Yeah. I guess.
- Okay.

373
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:26,107
So, first night?

374
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:28,809
Yeah. How do you know?

375
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:34,498
Just the blinding gleam of your uniform
is kind of a dead giveaway.

376
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,821
Well, you came to check on me
and you've checked on me,

377
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:43,591
so now if you don't mind,
I actually have a lot of work to do.

378
00:45:44,936 --> 00:45:48,246
Yeah. You seem super busy.

379
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:54,769
Wait... was that,
was that like a frown smile?

380
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:57,616
Was that, like, a fr-ile?

381
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:01,676
All right. So what's your story?

382
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:05,847
You got the short end of the straw
or you just got really unlucky?

383
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,448
Excuse me?

384
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,585
Well, someone made you come here
and check on me, right?

385
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:15,301
No. I don't... If you ask me,
I'm feeling pretty lucky.

386
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:21,829
Well, to be honest,
I don't completely mind the company.

387
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:25,733
- Rough night, I take it?
- Yeah, yeah. You could say that.

388
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:30,704
- That sounds terrible. What happened?
- Well, let's see.

389
00:46:30,804 --> 00:46:35,309
There is a crazy, homeless man
in holding as we speak.

390
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:37,892
He pissed all over my lobby.

391
00:46:39,614 --> 00:46:41,749
It's not really funny.

392
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:45,786
- It's... it's kind of funny.
- Actually, it was pretty gross.

393
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:50,324
Gross? I once had a perp shit
all over the back seat of my squad car.

394
00:46:50,924 --> 00:46:54,073
Well... you win.

395
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:02,784
Are you okay?

396
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,186
Yeah. I'm fine.

397
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:10,525
Listen...

398
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,482
honestly, when I found out
you were working this shift,

399
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,302
I snuck away to come and see you.

400
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:20,307
I knew your father.

401
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,664
- Were you with him that night?
- Yeah.

402
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:33,334
I was there when that Paymon fuck sh...

403
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,635
- It's okay.
- No, I'm sorry.

404
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:39,122
No, it's okay. I wanna know.
They never disclosed the details.

405
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:45,746
He and I arrived early
on the scene and...

406
00:47:45,846 --> 00:47:48,149
we were ordered to wait for backup.

407
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:51,485
But we could hear these poor girls

408
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:55,136
just begging for their lives.

409
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,872
So we went in.

410
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:00,728
And they opened fire.

411
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:04,199
And I was able to pull out four girls

412
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:07,019
while your dad held them off.

413
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:12,540
They killed six more girls
and two officers,

414
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,819
including your father.

415
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:20,631
He was a good cop.

416
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:24,059
And he'd be so proud of you.

417
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:29,623
Listen, I... I really have to go.

418
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:32,326
You... you really don't have to go.

419
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:35,329
I didn't mean what I said,
I'm sorry if I was rude. You can stay.

420
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:37,381
No, I...

421
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,970
Trust me, I'd love to but...

422
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:45,873
If you need anything at all
just give me a call,

423
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:49,377
and I can pop right over
and check on you.

424
00:48:49,477 --> 00:48:52,947
- Do you remember my name?
- Officer Price.

425
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:54,815
Right.

426
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:57,235
I'll see you around.

427
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:20,726
Officer Price?

428
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:44,380
It's so dark in here. It's cold.

429
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:54,710
Get down! Fuckin' get down right now.

430
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:05,764
No, please!

431
00:51:37,044 --> 00:51:40,080
Help! Help!

432
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,930
Help me! Help!

433
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,869
Help! Get me out!

434
00:51:46,921 --> 00:51:51,192
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down! What's wrong?

435
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,925
Get me out! Come on!

436
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:01,869
- I need to get out of here.
- This isn't real. This isn't real.

437
00:52:01,969 --> 00:52:04,689
- Get me out!
- This isn't real.

438
00:52:09,677 --> 00:52:12,657
Don't leave me in here!

439
00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:34,935
<i>From the kingdom of our father</i>

440
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:38,739

463
00:54:51,672 --> 00:54:55,342
- Yeah?
- Sir, this is Officer Loren.

464
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:58,479
- Is the place on fire?
- No, sir.

465
00:54:58,579 --> 00:55:01,982
- Are you dying?
- No, sir.

466
00:55:02,082 --> 00:55:05,035
Then why the fuck are you calling me?

467
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:08,468
I don't know.

468
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:12,092
I am seeing things, I think.

469
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:13,861
What?

470
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:15,910
Like...

471
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,486
I just don't know if I can finish
the end of the shift, sir.

472
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:26,140
Missy, if you can't handle one night alone
in an empty police station

473
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,076
then I think you picked
the wrong line of work.

474
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:32,647
Apparently, the apple fell pretty far
from the fucking tree.

475
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:36,383
So, should I inform the Captain
of your resignation

476
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:40,068
or should I expect to see you
at the end of the shift?

477
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:44,725
You'll see me at the end
of the shift, sir.

478
00:55:44,825 --> 00:55:46,360
Good.

479
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,668
And don't call me again.

480
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,474
This is Joe.

481
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:03,811
Hey Joe, this is Officer Loren. What time
you guys are gonna be down here?

482
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:08,281
I'm knee deep in shit right now. I told you,
I'd call you back if things change.

483
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:11,251
All right, I'm going to be waiting for you
outside in my squad car, okay?

484
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:14,633
- Yeah, whatever lady.
- Thanks, Joe.

485
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:06,146
- Hello.
- I escaped.

486
00:57:06,246 --> 00:57:09,109
- You escaped?
- I'm running.

487
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:13,080
Okay. Okay. This is good.
This is good. What's around you?

488
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,182
- Woods.
- Okay. What else?

489
00:57:15,282 --> 00:57:18,518
- Wait. There's a sign.
- Okay, what does it say?

490
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:19,953
Carmichael Road.

491
00:57:20,053 --> 00:57:22,490
Perfect. All right, is anybody
following you right now?

492
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:25,225
I don't... I don't know. I think so.

493
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,461
- Okay. Just hang tight, okay?
- Don't go.

494
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:30,464
No, I'm not going. I'll just gonna call
the dispatch on my cell phone

495
00:57:30,564 --> 00:57:33,207
and we're gonna get a unit
over to your location ASAP.

496
00:57:33,307 --> 00:57:34,783
Hurry!

497
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,974
You there?

498
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:43,290
They're getting close.

499
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:49,082
I'm gonna die, I know it.

500
00:57:49,182 --> 00:57:51,419
You're not... you're not gonna die.

501
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:54,468
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.

502
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:05,083
Monica, is there anything around you
you can use it as a weapon.

503
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,305
They are right next to me.

504
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,288
I'm here.

505
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,660
Hello?

506
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:28,138
Shit!

507
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,491
Police Department.

508
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,794
- Hello?
- Sanford Police Department.

509
00:58:33,894 --> 00:58:35,896
Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

510
00:58:35,996 --> 00:58:40,483
Please reference John-Victor-Ida-
one-five-two-six-three.

511
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,886
Please hold.

512
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,573
- Officer Loren?
- Yes.

513
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:49,843
- We spoke earlier regarding Monica Young.
- Yes, I have her location.

514
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,729
- I got in touch with her.
- Officer, she's dead.

515
00:58:53,713 --> 00:58:57,885
What? No, no, no. I literally
just got off the phone with her.

516
00:58:57,985 --> 00:59:00,571
No, she's been dead for a year.

517
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:03,805
Officer Loren?

518
00:59:04,558 --> 00:59:05,692
Yes.

519
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,562
She was the last victim
of the Paymon Family Massacre.

520
00:59:08,662 --> 00:59:12,915
Her body was found in the woods,
beaten to death with a baseball bat.

521
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,471
I don't understand.
I was just speaking to her. I was...

522
00:59:17,571 --> 00:59:20,874
Look... there were only three
family members linked to the murders

523
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,543
but there were over a dozen more
living in the commune.

524
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,045
Maybe you were right.

525
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:29,265
There's a chance that the calls are coming
from one of them. Playing a sick joke.

526
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,200
Or...

527
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,735
Or what?

528
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,224
This is just between
the two of us, okay?

529
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,293
Nobody likes to talk
about it in the department,

530
00:59:39,393 --> 00:59:43,163
but it was more than just rusty pipes
that got us out of that building.

531
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:46,266
The Paymon family wasn't killed
on the scene like the news said.

532
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:50,710
They committed suicide in holding,
and after that, well...

533
00:59:51,003 --> 00:59:53,006
things started happening.

534
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:55,709
At first it was small,
like the lights turning on and off.

535
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,664
Missing evidence. Abnormal sightings.

536
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:03,250
Soon we couldn't house perps in our
own cells without them freaking out.

537
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,341
The captain had enough
and he pleaded with the county...

538
01:00:05,441 --> 01:00:07,301
I gotta go.

539
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:18,589
- Hello?
- Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

540
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:22,782
- Mom.
- I was wrong to bring up your father.

541
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,001
- Oh, shit!
- Is everything all right?

542
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:29,489
- Jess?
- I gotta call you back.

543
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:31,879
- I just don't like how you say good-bye.
- I gotta call you back, all right?

544
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:33,846
I love...

545
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:42,035
Hey! Hey!

546
01:03:42,535 --> 01:03:43,950
Hey!

547
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:19,817
I don't think you've realized just how lucky
you are to be a part of all this.

548
01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:26,391
How do I know
this is even really happening?

549
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:31,198
Do you see this gun in my hand?

550
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:35,934
Maybe that gun is still in my belt.

551
01:04:36,523 --> 01:04:40,279
Maybe I'm talking to a wall.

552
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:45,198
Maybe I have gone as bat-shit-crazy
as I think you are.

553
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,182
I could pull the trigger
and we could find out.

554
01:04:56,209 --> 01:04:59,879
If crazy is being devoted
to something you love,

555
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:04,765
then I'm as crazy
as a slimy snail in a tin can.

556
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:08,869
I would do anything for him.

557
01:05:10,557 --> 01:05:14,919
I'm a little jealous that he took
those two bitches with him that night.

558
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:19,440
Should have been me.

559
01:05:24,237 --> 01:05:26,286
I forgive him.

560
01:05:27,874 --> 01:05:30,324
I can never stay mad at John Michael.

561
01:05:31,411 --> 01:05:33,380
You need to give me
my fucking weapon back.

562
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,261
- You need to shut the fuck up!
- Okay.

563
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,876
Have you seen him here tonight?

564
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:50,263
You have. I knew it. I felt him.

565
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,807
Tonight is the one-year anniversary
of his death.

566
01:05:53,907 --> 01:05:57,989
And I'm here to celebrate it. So...

567
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,676
Yes?

568
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,528
They know where I am.

569
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:17,116
- Who the fuck is this?
- Monica.

570
01:07:17,216 --> 01:07:19,902
Monica is dead.

571
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:07,341
I don't wanna die.

572
01:09:16,603 --> 01:09:18,655
Please.

573
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:44,683
Fuck! What the fuck?

574
01:10:22,201 --> 01:10:23,736
Hello?

575
01:10:23,836 --> 01:10:25,888
Cuddle Bug.

576
01:10:30,076 --> 01:10:31,878
Dad!

577
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,264
I missed you.

578
01:10:35,615 --> 01:10:38,718
This isn't... this isn't real.

579
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,072
It is baby.

580
01:10:41,587 --> 01:10:43,289
I'm so proud of you.

581
01:10:43,389 --> 01:10:46,292
You're just like your old man, you know?

582
01:10:46,392 --> 01:10:48,761
Strong, dedicated.

583
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:51,072
Loyal to the job.

584
01:10:52,298 --> 01:10:55,644
I did it for you.

585
01:10:56,235 --> 01:10:58,955
Then why were you trying to leave?

586
01:10:59,138 --> 01:11:01,756
I laid down my life for this job.

587
01:11:02,141 --> 01:11:04,644
I expect you to do the same.

588
01:11:04,744 --> 01:11:09,008
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm really sorry.
I just got really scared.

589
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,294
But I won't leave. Okay?

590
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:15,964
That's my Cuddle Bug.

591
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:21,237
Now, the man that took your father's life
is still in this building.

592
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,044
I want you to do something about it.

593
01:11:29,836 --> 01:11:31,551
Dad?

594
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,153
Dad?

595
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,456
Dad?

596
01:11:54,627 --> 01:11:56,806
Hey, how did you get out?

597
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,711
Get on your knees.

598
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,820
All the way down. Come on.
Hands behind your back.

599
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,151
Fucking killing me man.

600
01:13:15,908 --> 01:13:19,590
This is Jessica Loren at the old station.
I'm in need of assistance.

601
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:24,935
I repeat, officer in need
of fucking assistance.

602
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,728
Jessica.

603
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:10,933
Come on. I swear on my life.

604
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,344
I'm not fucking with you.

605
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:43,916
"I recognize this badge as a symbol
of fearlessness and faith

606
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,886
to be held so long as I am true
to the ethics of the police service.

607
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:51,057
I will constantly strive to achieve
these objectives and ideals,

608
01:16:51,157 --> 01:16:53,325
dedicating myself before God

609
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:57,174
to my chosen profession,
law enforcement."

610
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:14,157
- Daddy?
- Jessica.

611
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,727
They're coming, baby.

612
01:17:18,117 --> 01:17:20,069
You have to stop them.

613
01:17:20,586 --> 01:17:22,465
Whatever it takes.

614
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,573
Who is coming?

615
01:17:46,612 --> 01:17:48,629
Don't move!

616
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:59,337
You're gonna die, pretty little bitch.
Come on and find us.

617
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:16,323
Father Paymon's ghost belongs to us.

618
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:02,588
- Come here, bitch!
- You're gonna die, you fucking bitch!

619
01:19:02,688 --> 01:19:05,208
You're gonna die, bitch!

620
01:19:19,405 --> 01:19:21,173
...he is more powerful than you.

621
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:25,161
He is righteous, he is the way.
You will die.

622
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:33,165
Don't move!

623
01:19:34,253 --> 01:19:38,190
The blood of his children
will resurrect as flesh.

624
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:42,276
And all who oppose him will perish.

625
01:19:53,305 --> 01:19:55,186
Sarge?

626
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:09,822
- Don't move, hands behind your head.
- Help me! Somebody help me!

627
01:20:10,122 --> 01:20:13,092
Lady, what you're doing?
It's me, I'm Joe, from Bioclean.

628
01:20:13,192 --> 01:20:15,336
- I talked to you earlier today.
- Drop the weapon.

629
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:18,696
- No! Please don't do this.
- Drop!

630
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,591
No.

631
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,799
No, it's not...

632
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:57,386
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

633
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,282
Dispatch, this is Sergeant Cohen,

634
01:21:10,382 --> 01:21:13,994
I have an officer down
and in need of immediate assistance.

635
01:21:14,094 --> 01:21:15,766
I have...

636
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:34,035
<i>Through the mountains I'll be guided</i>

637
01:21:34,135 --> 01:21:37,570
<i>Until I do see...</i>
