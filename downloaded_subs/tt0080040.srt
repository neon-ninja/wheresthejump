1
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:08,556
Damn!

2
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,258
<i>In the state capital today, the legislature
is winding up the current session</i>

3
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,276
<i>and by this time next week
all representatives will be involved</i>

4
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:31,084
<i>wooing constituents
for next springs primary.</i>

5
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,030
<i>The weather bureau marks
the current Victoria County</i>

6
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:38,750
<i>temperature of 98 degrees and climbing.
A high of a 102 is predicted.</i>

7
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:52,271
Looks like Woody's farm did it again.

8
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,121
What happened?

9
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,907
The next time we go on a trip,
I'm riding this Jeep with you guys.

10
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:06,004
Look at the size of that hole!

11
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:09,953
- Didn't you bring a spare?
- Hoi! Woody came prepared.

12
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:12,533
Only didn't have any air in it.

13
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,632
He went off to the gas station.

14
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:18,147
He'll never find
one on this old road.

15
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,279
Serves him right.

16
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,056
Poor thing!
I'll bet his feet are aching.

17
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,243
Hello?

18
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,284
Hey, can I get some service?

19
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:16,580
Hello?

20
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:28,969
Hey?

21
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:41,385
Hello!

22
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,801
Anybody back here?

23
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:53,744
Excuse me.

24
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,230
Ma'am...

25
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:17,614
Open the door.

26
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,187
Open the door!

27
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,594
Let me go!

28
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:29,412
Let me go!

29
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:48,467
Let me go!

30
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,907
Look, where you going we're
hot all over those springs.

31
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,523
You know, these
tourist traps are all alike...

32
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,764
They give you a big billboard,
and when you get there...

33
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:40,722
there's nothing but a roadside shack
and a bunch of cheap drinking.

34
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,112
Look!

35
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,473
It's Woody's tyre.

36
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:04,647
He must have gone this way, right?

37
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:05,748
Okay.

38
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,090
What happened?

39
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:46,283
I don't know.

40
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,765
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, man.

41
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,447
What happened?

42
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:18,925
I never had any trouble
with this thing before.

43
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:29,327
Shit!

44
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:34,312
Let me know when you get
your act together, sweetheart.

45
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:41,226
What do you think it is, Jerry?

46
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,555
Well, I'm a law student.
What do I know about cars?

47
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:48,918
- Hey you guys, come take a look at this!
- What is it?

48
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:51,560
I don't know...
I think it's paradise!

49
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:20,560
And you thought this
was a cheap tourist trap!

50
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:23,305
Well, I don't know about you
guys, but I'm going swimming!

51
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:25,786
I don't think you should.

52
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,417
Come on Molly.
Relax for a while.

53
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:32,551
- We can't go swimming anyway.
- Why not?

54
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,644
- We didn't bring our bathing suits.
- So?

55
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,039
Who needs a bathing suit?

56
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:48,225
Howdy?

57
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:50,598
You kids enjoying yourselves?

58
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:55,665
How about you, Missy?
You look to be having a good time.

59
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,737
Yes, sir.

60
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,403
Used to be I charge 75
cents a day to swim here.

61
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,508
Not no more though.

62
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:12,973
Used to be I'd have
25 to 30 visitors a day here.

63
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:17,403
But then the government
decided to build a new highway.

64
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:30,191
What is your name?

65
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:32,674
- Molly.
- Molly?

66
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:34,204
Hey, I like that.

67
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:36,568
I do not get many visitors, no more.

68
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:39,266
It seems that most folks
are using the new highway.

69
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:42,946
I guess they figured, it's gonna get
them to where they're going fast.

70
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:47,577
Everyone is in such
a damn hurry these days!

71
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:53,693
Do you know why that is, Molly?

72
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:55,935
I don't either.

73
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,280
There's not a place like
this in the whole world.

74
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:03,832
What bring you kids
to this parts anyway?

75
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:05,359
We didn't mean to trespass...

76
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:10,165
- Our friend got lost.
- A friend?

77
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,622
You see it...

78
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,259
Their car broke down.

79
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:18,629
This friend of yours... she a girl too?

80
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:22,566
No, he's a he.
His name is Woody!

81
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,628
Well, I can't help you.  Ain't see no
one in these parts for weeks now.

82
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:37,038
I thought I'd better
come down and warn you.

83
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:46,375
You all best leave
before it gets dark.

84
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:49,905
What happens at dark?

85
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,977
Obviously a hole fills up
with water moccasins.

86
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:56,210
If you feel something
wiggling around you feet

87
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:59,561
it's just the early ones
comes out finding a good spot.

88
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,022
Hey, you guys all right?

89
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,915
- Some old geezer ran us off.
- He didn't run us off.

90
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,989
- Well, he was weird.
- Yes.

91
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:24,035
- I felt sorry for him.
- Oh, yeah?

92
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,481
Well how do you know he
wasn't some crazy old coop

93
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:29,070
like to chop up pretty
girls by moonlight.

94
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,070
Yeah, they always get
the pretty ones first.

95
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:34,122
Well, if that's the case, then you
girls have absolutely nothing to fear.

96
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:37,044
Very funny, Carl deGraaf.

97
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:02,188
What seems to be
the trouble, young fella?

98
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,121
Umm.  Not sure.
Can't get it started.

99
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,560
- But I'm not much of a mechanics.
- Well, maybe I can help out.

100
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:12,163
Why don't you kids hop aboard?
We'll drop by the house for my tools.

101
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,886
Well, it's just down
the road, a piece in.

102
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:20,991
Well, we really
appreciate that, Mr. Slausen!

103
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,793
My pleasure, Molly.
My pleasure.

104
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:24,712
Well, come on kids!
Come on!

105
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:37,629
<i>Welcome to Slausen Museum.
Now gone out of business.</i>

106
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,477
Come on in kids!
Have a look around.

107
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:55,662
I decorated it myself.

108
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,683
Where did you get all these junk?

109
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,739
Oh it's junk alright.
I'm just a collector at heart.

110
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:06,240
I can't seem to bring myself
to throw anything away.

111
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:09,783
See my wife passed away just
after they finished the highway.

112
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:13,486
And the look of that is,
these junk, my memories.

113
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:15,805
Let's have that
beer I promised you.

114
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:23,063
Here we are.

115
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:30,215
Here you are Molly.

116
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,302
It's too bad you had to close
this place down, Mr. Slausen.

117
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:38,120
- I'm real sorry.
- Well, thank you, thank you Molly.

118
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:40,128
But hell, that ain't the worst
thing that ever happened to me.

119
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:45,087
Hell I was kicked out of the Navy when I
was 19, kicked in the head when I was 20,

120
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,826
... and kicked into jail when I was 21.

121
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:50,826
And that was just to warm me up
for what life had in store for me.

122
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,987
No sir, it's been a lot worse.

123
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:58,672
You get to be my age, you start
to understand what living is all about.

124
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,152
This is so life like!

125
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,649
Yeah, my brother got pretty
good at making those figures.

126
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,826
Your brother made these?

127
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:10,685
And he got so good, they hired him away
from me.  Folks out in the city did it.

128
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:15,099
He's out there still making dummies
for one of them Wax Museums.

129
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,622
And watch this...

130
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:37,495
Pretty good heh?

131
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,807
Used to scare the hell out
of kids and yankee tourists.

132
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,320
That's quite a killing.
How did you do that?

133
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,378
No, my brother did that.

134
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,460
He was real good with
mechanical things too you know.

135
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,025
Gears, motors, pulleys
all that sort of stuff.

136
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,374
He was a real talent.

137
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,067
Is that where you live?

138
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,769
Nope.

139
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,355
I live right here in the museum.

140
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,709
- Who lives over there?
- Well ...

141
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:01,554
Nobody really.

142
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,291
Just Davey.

143
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,272
Who is Davey?

144
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:12,466
Well, Davey Crockett, who else!

145
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:19,070
You see, he and General
Custer here couldn't get along,

146
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:20,480
... so I had to separate them.

147
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:28,325
You girls mind guarding the place
while me and Jerry fix up his Jeep.

148
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:31,374
Guard it from what?

149
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,156
Oh, souvenir hunters.

150
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,718
Mr. Slausen!

151
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:43,133
- Can I use your phone?
- Oh sure, help yourself!

152
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,072
But it doesn't work.

153
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:48,567
I got nobody to call.

154
00:20:51,023 --> 00:20:54,265
Oh if you are thinking about
wandering around outside...

155
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:56,034
I wouldn't if I were you.

156
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:59,975
- Why not?
- Well, I just wouldn't ...

157
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,989
it's not safe at night.
We got trouble with coyotes.

158
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,533
Be back directly.

159
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:25,268
Something funny about that man.

160
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,507
He's lonely.

161
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:31,963
Likes living in the
past, that's all.

162
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,975
Something funny
about that house too.

163
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,456
I don't think Mr. Slausen wants
you fooling around out there.

164
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,539
Look, he's hiding something.  I mean,
why else would he want us to stay away?

165
00:21:43,574 --> 00:21:46,660
- Who cares?
- Aren't you curious?

166
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:48,299
- Nope.
- Well, I am.

167
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,619
Beside, Davey may have
a phone that works.

168
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:54,319
Eileen, don't go out there.

169
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:58,167
If I'm not back in 10
minutes inform the posse.

170
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:43,548
Hello?

171
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:55,576
<i>Okay by me, I just assumed ...</i>

172
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:00,998
Hello?

173
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,117
Oh, my God.

174
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,251
Eileen...

175
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:18,490
Woody?
Is that you?

176
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,164
Woody?

177
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,000
Eileen...

178
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:30,002
Woody?

179
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:14,843
Woody?

180
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:31,658
Look at this!

181
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:44,324
Look at her features.

182
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:47,261
Aren't they strange?

183
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:50,299
Kind of looks like she could move.

184
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,432
What's the matter?

185
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,730
Feels like flesh.

186
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:04,151
Oh, you're right!

187
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,200
Must be made out of some
special rubber or something.

188
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:15,552
I don't want to
look at it anymore.

189
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:19,372
Molly, it's only a mannequin.

190
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:32,806
- Did you hear that?
- Mm hmm.

191
00:26:42,315 --> 00:26:45,128
- Did you see anything?
- No.

192
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,181
I scared you, didn't I?

193
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:54,630
You should see your face!
It's white as a sheet.

194
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,680
Excuse me, Mr. Slausen.

195
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,198
No.

196
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,940
We didn't hear your truck.

197
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,557
That's because
Jerry took it to town.

198
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:05,387
I walked up.  Hell, we
couldn't fix that Jeep of his.

199
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,808
Nice boy that Jerry.
Got a real head on his shoulders.

200
00:27:08,882 --> 00:27:12,900
-You two are married long?
-Oh, a while.

201
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:15,027
Yeah, you be good to him, you hear.

202
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:18,223
It's real important a wife
take good care of her husband.

203
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,441
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

204
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:23,825
My wife was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

205
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,690
What a charmer she was!

206
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:29,337
She could talk the birds
right down out of the trees.

207
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:32,517
And a worker too, Molly.
A real good worker.

208
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:36,574
Man can't ask much
more than that, can he?

209
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:40,453
She could make a pot of chilly, make your
mouth water just thinking about them.

210
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:47,366
We were gonna make this
place into a real fine resort.

211
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,409
She wanted to
build a nice hotel ...

212
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:54,161
down by the spring.

213
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:00,013
She died so young.

214
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:05,016
It was cancer that killed her.

215
00:28:08,644 --> 00:28:10,744
She died in my arms.

216
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:12,732
I'm sorry.

217
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:16,720
It should have been me.

218
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,058
I'm sorry, I...

219
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:27,501
I get carried away sometimes.

220
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,566
Where is that other girl?

221
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:45,996
Oh hmm ... she went outside.

222
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,748
I thought I told her not to.

223
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:51,318
Well, she ... said she
just wanted to cool off.

224
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,765
I'll bet she's
snooping around outside.

225
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:22,880
Davey?

226
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,543
Davey, are you there?

227
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:35,842
Davey.

228
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,400
Oh, my God!

229
00:29:58,385 --> 00:29:59,569
What are you looking at?

230
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:01,988
Mr. Slausen's photo album.

231
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,063
This must be his brother.

232
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,959
You're a regular
little snoop, Molly.

233
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,620
It was on the coffee table.

234
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:15,463
Mr. Slausen might not be too happy if he
found you checking through his pictures.

235
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,822
- Becky!
- What?

236
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,184
Look at this!

237
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:27,846
- It's probably his wife.  So what?
- Don't you see?

238
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,542
See what?

239
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:38,391
She looks just like
that mannequin there.

240
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:41,830
You're right.
How weird!

241
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:50,697
It seems this is the
mannequin of his wife.

242
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:52,342
I don't know.

243
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:55,854
Maybe it's just his
way of remembering her.

244
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:58,533
I loved her very much.

245
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,963
I wanted to keep
her memory alive forever.

246
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,640
This was the best way I know how.

247
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,433
That's the whole purpose
of wax museums, you know.

248
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:15,680
Keep the memory of the past alive.

249
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:19,758
And it's easier for me this way.

250
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:24,186
- She was very beautiful.
- She still is.

251
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,384
Where's Eileen?

252
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:39,196
I didn't find her.  She...

253
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,216
probably went
back down to the jeep.

254
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,300
- By herself, without telling us?
- Or where else could she be?

255
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:57,873
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to find her!

256
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,631
With a gun?

257
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:03,284
Alright, without a gun.

258
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:09,550
Mr. Slausen!

259
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:11,671
Can we go with you?

260
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,502
It's best you ladies
stay put, right here.

261
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:25,230
Stay put, my ass!

262
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:34,142
Becky!

263
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:37,609
- Don't go.
- I have to!

264
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:40,423
No you don't.  You can
stay here and wait for Jerry.

265
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:42,084
I'm going.

266
00:32:42,776 --> 00:32:44,477
Alright!

267
00:32:44,903 --> 00:32:46,483
I'll come with you.

268
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:49,649
But I think we're making a mistake.

269
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:17,401
Did you hear that?

270
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:19,998
Mm Hmm.
That is Eileen's laugh!

271
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:21,953
I'll bet you 10 bucks
I know she's in there.

272
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:25,567
Woody. What if you have some
lucky farm boy.  It has to be, Woody.

273
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:29,181
Then why don't let those two
a few minutes in his house?

274
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:32,312
We got to climb the patios
and get the hell at them.

275
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:35,469
- No, leave them alone.
- They deserve this!

276
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,131
Come on, Becky.  I've had all the
excitement I can take for one day.

277
00:33:38,132 --> 00:33:39,489
I'm going back.
Let's go.

278
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:41,266
- Chicken!
- That's right!

279
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,904
- Now, let's go.
- I'm going in.

280
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,315
Then you're going in alone,
because I'm going back.

281
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,003
Becky!

282
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:51,854
Come on, you've got no
business going in there!

283
00:34:57,382 --> 00:34:58,933
Eileen!

284
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,187
I'm in here.

285
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,190
Eileen!

286
00:35:11,788 --> 00:35:12,591
Woody!

287
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:15,179
I ... I know you're in here.

288
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,050
I'm in ...

289
00:35:18,707 --> 00:35:19,639
Woody.

290
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,247
Come on!

291
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:31,765
Are we through?

292
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,862
Jesus!

293
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:45,520
Come on, guys.

294
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,387
Look, that's not funny.

295
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:54,494
You're beginning to scare me.

296
00:35:57,779 --> 00:35:59,083
Please.

297
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:01,215
Becky.

298
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,487
Eileen!

299
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,010
Eileen?

300
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:39,887
Eileen, is that you?

301
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:42,657
Eileen!

302
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:22,244
Open the door!

303
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,350
I brought you a visitor.

304
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:21,420
You are so pretty.

305
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,376
No, please!
Not again!

306
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:26,827
Why don't you like me?

307
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:45,617
Beck?

308
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:47,841
Becky!

309
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:52,417
Jerry!

310
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:54,769
Are you alright?

311
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:57,798
Who is he?

312
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,216
Slausen's crazy brother.

313
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,020
Where are the others?

314
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,605
I don't know.

315
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:08,925
What's he going to do to us?

316
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,192
He's going to kill us.

317
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,079
I was stopping for
gas along the highway.

318
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,786
I never even saw him coming.

319
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,642
He's crazy.

320
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:25,021
We're all going to die!

321
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:31,739
We're all going to die!

322
00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:06,550
We are going to have a party!

323
00:42:06,585 --> 00:42:10,534
How do I look, huh?
How do I look?

324
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:13,853
Well, here we are.

325
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,516
Here we are.

326
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,109
Drink.

327
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:28,113
Drink.

328
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:31,321
Leave her alone!

329
00:42:34,558 --> 00:42:36,876
You can't get away.

330
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,188
- This is for you.
- No.

331
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,388
No ...?

332
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,184
It doesn't matter.

333
00:43:05,638 --> 00:43:09,491
It's time.
The party's over.

334
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:17,058
Oh, you're so pretty.

335
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:20,497
It's a shame you have to die.

336
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:37,618
No!

337
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,245
It'll be quick.

338
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:57,860
But it won't be easy.

339
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,528
You'll die of fright.

340
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,148
Please.

341
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:13,104
Please.

342
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:17,593
It feels good, doesn't it, huh?

343
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:19,920
Cool and soothing.

344
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,764
It's funny about plastic.
As it starts to dry ...

345
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:38,732
... it gets very hot,
almost burning the skin.

346
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:49,684
You'll panic as I seal the lips.

347
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,691
And now the eyes.

348
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:11,052
Oh, your face is burning now.
The plastic is getting tight.

349
00:45:11,352 --> 00:45:14,536
Your world is dark.

350
00:45:15,434 --> 00:45:18,664
You'll never see again.

351
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:22,664
It's getting hard
to breathe, isn't it?

352
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:26,205
I'm going to seal the last hope.

353
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:31,689
You won't be able to
breathe, but you won't suffocate.

354
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:38,305
Your heart will burst from fright
before you lose consciousness.

355
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:55,657
Yes

356
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,609
Now...

357
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,585
you are one of us...

358
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:11,663
Isn't she pretty?

359
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,777
Stop it!

360
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:02,879
Oh, my God.

361
00:47:51,123 --> 00:47:54,010
She is a pretty girl.

362
00:47:55,118 --> 00:47:57,976
My brother didn't know about her.

363
00:47:57,992 --> 00:48:00,755
I kept her hidden here.

364
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:04,646
He doesn't know much, my brother.

365
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,946
He's kind of stupid!

366
00:48:08,538 --> 00:48:13,166
All he cares about is
that foolish museum of his.

367
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:16,468
I hate him!

368
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:21,094
One day I'm going
to get rid of him.

369
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,790
He should let me go to the city.

370
00:48:25,107 --> 00:48:28,266
I could work for the Wax Museum.

371
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:31,318
Oh how much I hate him.

372
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,933
He makes me wear
these stupid masks.

373
00:48:34,934 --> 00:48:37,119
Do you know why?

374
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:42,618
Do you know why?

375
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:45,598
Because I'm handsome.

376
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:48,426
I'm better looking than he is.

377
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:51,082
He doesn't like his wife to see me.

378
00:48:51,183 --> 00:48:54,883
He is afraid she'll
be attracted to me.

379
00:48:55,379 --> 00:48:58,794
He thinks I stay
here all the time.

380
00:48:58,996 --> 00:49:02,370
He doesn't know what I really do.

381
00:49:03,668 --> 00:49:04,839
I go out.

382
00:49:05,574 --> 00:49:10,244
People don't come here anymore,
so I have to go out to the highway.

383
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:14,492
The gas station is perfect.

384
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:19,137
That's where I found Tina.

385
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:23,206
She's so pretty!

386
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:36,326
Pretty good trick, huh?

387
00:49:36,327 --> 00:49:39,547
My brother doesn't
like me to do that stuff.

388
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:43,557
He pretends he doesn't
even know about my power.

389
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:45,733
But it feels good when I use it.

390
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:48,102
I shouldn't have to hide it!

391
00:49:48,703 --> 00:49:51,632
I mean I can control it!
I can!

392
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:55,830
I shouldn't have to hide it!
It feels good!

393
00:49:58,047 --> 00:50:00,669
But it scares me.

394
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:06,508
Sometimes I really don't
know what I'm doing.

395
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,229
Isn't she pretty?

396
00:50:13,755 --> 00:50:15,673
Eileen!

397
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:29,244
Who is it?

398
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,679
<i>Molly.</i>

399
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:42,618
Somebody's there!
I can hear you!

400
00:51:02,777 --> 00:51:06,074
Come on, you guys!
Quit fooling around with me!

401
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,078
Seen my friend?

402
00:51:15,078 --> 00:51:17,703
Wait, little girl.

403
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:22,486
Little girl!

404
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:27,127
See my friend!

405
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,630
<i>- Molly!
- Little girl.</i>

406
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:37,042
<i>Molly!</i>

407
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:06,073
Don't go away, little girl.

408
00:52:13,955 --> 00:52:16,495
See my friend!

409
00:52:20,814 --> 00:52:23,677
<i>Molly!</i>

410
00:53:19,987 --> 00:53:23,064
- Help me!
- Good Lord girl!  What happened to you?

411
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,618
He's trying to kill me!

412
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,872
Get us out of here!
Hurry!

413
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:30,992
What happened to you?
What's the matter?

414
00:53:31,394 --> 00:53:34,055
This... thing...

415
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:36,776
- It's out there!
- Alright, calm down now Molly.

416
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:38,880
Calm down.
You're safe with me.

417
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:41,187
What, was it an animal
scared you like this?

418
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:46,309
No.   It was some
kind of horrible man!

419
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:02,363
What did this thing look like?

420
00:54:03,354 --> 00:54:05,565
He was wearing ...

421
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:08,750
He was wearing some kind of mask.

422
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,411
Oh, dear God.

423
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:19,122
That man was my brother.

424
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:25,265
You are hiding him, aren't you?

425
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:28,915
You don't understand, Molly.
He never hurt anyone before.

426
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:30,896
He killed Woody!

427
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,010
And probably the
others, for all we know.

428
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:37,837
I was only trying to protect him.
Take care of him!

429
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:39,780
He is my brother!

430
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:44,950
It's not his fault,
he's the way he is.

431
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,487
We have to get the police.

432
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,777
I'm sorry, but we have to!

433
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,790
Well Molly, maybe
I better find him first.

434
00:54:52,687 --> 00:54:54,014
Bring him in myself.

435
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:56,768
No, no!
He's too dangerous!

436
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,126
What mask was he wearing?

437
00:55:00,527 --> 00:55:02,705
Looks like a doll's face.

438
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,612
He's trying to look like
me when I was a little boy.

439
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:09,088
He always wanted to be like me.

440
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:11,152
You see, I am his big brother.

441
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,091
He always wanted
everything I ever had.

442
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:17,681
Including my face.

443
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,870
Look, I'm gonna stop at the
house and turn on the radio.

444
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:29,402
- He always comes to the radio.
- No, no.  I won't go back there.

445
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:32,321
Now I don't want them to
shoot him down like an animal.

446
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:34,652
I just want to get
him back to the house.

447
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,599
So I'll know where to find him,
when I get back from the police.

448
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:42,191
Alright, what I'm going
to do is turn on the radio.

449
00:55:42,392 --> 00:55:44,459
You don't even have to come in.

450
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,898
- I'm coming with you!
- I'll only be a second!

451
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:02,889
I'm just going to set the radio
in the window and turn it on.

452
00:56:03,813 --> 00:56:06,355
I'm scared!
I don't want to be alone.

453
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:08,363
Hop out.

454
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:17,408
Now I'm going to cork this.
Now here!

455
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:21,592
If you see anybody not invited,
point this at him and they'll leave.

456
00:56:22,285 --> 00:56:24,247
I don't know how to shoot.

457
00:56:24,658 --> 00:56:28,849
Honey, just point and pull the
trigger. That thing will do the rest.

458
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:00,695
Mr. Slausen!

459
00:57:05,491 --> 00:57:07,847
Mr. Slausen!
Are you coming?

460
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:17,548
Mr. Slausen!
Did you hear me?

461
00:57:24,662 --> 00:57:27,435
Mr. Slausen!

462
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:34,649
Thank you God.

463
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:40,237
Okay, Mr. Slausen!
Let's go, please!

464
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:53,598
Mr. Slausen!

465
00:57:54,176 --> 00:57:56,502
Mr. Slausen!

466
00:58:04,043 --> 00:58:06,204
Little girl.

467
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:34,032
Bang.

468
00:58:34,234 --> 00:58:35,735
Bang!

469
00:58:35,636 --> 00:58:37,904
then you shot me ...

470
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,613
... with blanks.

471
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,394
Bang, bang, you're dead.

472
00:58:58,856 --> 00:59:00,576
You!

473
00:59:24,012 --> 00:59:25,667
Jerry!

474
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:27,832
Jerry!

475
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:33,937
Jerry!

476
01:00:21,582 --> 01:00:24,480
<i>Molly!</i>

477
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:42,187
Jerry.

478
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,870
Jerry!

479
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:48,169
This is a blade or something.

480
01:00:49,486 --> 01:00:51,072
Alright ...

481
01:00:51,073 --> 01:00:52,737
Try slide it over here.

482
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:04,848
I got it!

483
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:38,526
It's nice and hot.

484
01:01:42,328 --> 01:01:43,817
No.

485
01:01:43,853 --> 01:01:46,725
There now ... that's better.

486
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,099
Go on.

487
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:50,658
Eat your soup.

488
01:01:56,984 --> 01:01:59,915
- How's that?
- Let's eat.

489
01:01:59,918 --> 01:02:02,131
That's what I said.
Let's eat.

490
01:02:04,726 --> 01:02:07,823
- It's good?
- Yes, it's very good.

491
01:02:08,053 --> 01:02:09,409
You want some crackers?

492
01:02:09,443 --> 01:02:12,602
- I'd like some more crackers, please.
- That's what I said.

493
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:18,264
- Yes, the crackers are very good.
- Are the crackers good?

494
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:24,101
Oh, I got to fix that.

495
01:02:48,653 --> 01:02:49,905
Who are you?

496
01:03:01,118 --> 01:03:02,924
Won't you take me home?

497
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,045
Did you see something?

498
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:29,785
Shhh.  Be still and
don't fidget so much.

499
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:41,681
Damn!

500
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:35,237
You can't get away from me, mister.

501
01:07:29,602 --> 01:07:31,981
What on earth has
happened to you, child.

502
01:07:38,613 --> 01:07:40,148
Now you just take it easy.

503
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:43,216
I'll have you scrubbed
it up in no time.

504
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:51,816
Alright, there you are.

505
01:07:53,435 --> 01:07:56,122
I'll just get my doctoring kit.

506
01:08:12,837 --> 01:08:14,544
Mr. Slausen!

507
01:08:15,547 --> 01:08:17,438
Just a minute.

508
01:08:21,035 --> 01:08:22,649
Becky!

509
01:08:23,085 --> 01:08:24,085
Woody?

510
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:30,101
Woody.

511
01:10:23,693 --> 01:10:25,619
Wake up, little girl.

512
01:10:27,273 --> 01:10:28,962
Little girl.

513
01:10:30,341 --> 01:10:32,391
Come on, girl.

514
01:10:33,372 --> 01:10:35,608
Everybody's waiting.

515
01:10:36,902 --> 01:10:38,892
Come on!
Up!

516
01:11:01,572 --> 01:11:03,532
There we are!

517
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:17,103
Little girl.
You look tired.

518
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:18,477
Stop!

519
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:24,135
Stop!

520
01:13:26,187 --> 01:13:27,942
Stop!

521
01:13:31,354 --> 01:13:34,378
Stop!

522
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:47,483
It's time.

523
01:13:54,266 --> 01:13:56,262
- What are going to do to me?
- Don't talk!

524
01:14:03,471 --> 01:14:05,729
This used to be my brother's room.

525
01:14:08,994 --> 01:14:10,604
He's dead now.

526
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:17,798
I trusted him.
He was a good man.

527
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:22,568
I always gave him
anything he ever wanted.

528
01:14:23,947 --> 01:14:25,888
What are you going to do to me?

529
01:14:26,023 --> 01:14:28,377
Do to you, Molly?
I'm going to take care of you.

530
01:14:29,412 --> 01:14:32,186
Here, here.
This will warm you up some.

531
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:41,310
You're not like the others.

532
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:45,354
There's something
special about you.

533
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:50,067
Isn't my wife pretty?

534
01:14:56,545 --> 01:14:58,359
You remind me of her.

535
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:01,252
Yeah, yeah.

536
01:15:01,387 --> 01:15:02,529
That's why you're so special.

537
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:09,693
There.

538
01:15:11,128 --> 01:15:12,772
Please don't.

539
01:15:20,235 --> 01:15:21,576
Mr. Slausen!

540
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:30,042
Molly.

541
01:15:34,377 --> 01:15:35,842
Talk to me.

542
01:15:37,785 --> 01:15:39,353
Tell me you love me.

543
01:15:41,805 --> 01:15:43,897
Tell me you love me.

544
01:15:50,365 --> 01:15:51,431
Tell me.

545
01:15:52,599 --> 01:15:54,923
I love you.

546
01:16:36,741 --> 01:16:37,884
I killed her.

547
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,820
I killed the both of them.

548
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,088
Her and my brother.

549
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:55,728
They were whoring behind my back.

550
01:17:02,324 --> 01:17:04,484
Whoring in my own house!

551
01:17:06,136 --> 01:17:08,830
Well, she and him had to die.

552
01:17:10,121 --> 01:17:12,330
I got a legal right to that.

553
01:17:15,459 --> 01:17:17,445
That's what the Law says...

554
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,722
A man finds his
wife cheating on him.

555
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:30,093
He's got a legal right
to kill them both.

556
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:40,029
Afterwards, I missed her.

557
01:17:43,589 --> 01:17:46,934
That's when I decided to
make that figure of her,

558
01:17:46,935 --> 01:17:48,869
the woman in the museum.

559
01:17:50,175 --> 01:17:52,458
I kept her alive that way!

560
01:17:55,597 --> 01:17:58,434
I didn't really
want to kill them.

561
01:17:59,669 --> 01:18:01,181
Not really.

562
01:18:02,616 --> 01:18:04,069
It was like ...

563
01:18:05,304 --> 01:18:07,989
I couldn't control myself!

564
01:18:11,197 --> 01:18:12,251
Molly!

565
01:18:20,435 --> 01:18:21,575
Jerry!

566
01:18:23,424 --> 01:18:24,751
Molly!

567
01:18:31,435 --> 01:18:33,197
Jerry?

568
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,668
- Jerry!
- Molly!

569
01:18:58,584 --> 01:18:59,741
Come on, Molly!

570
01:19:06,557 --> 01:19:08,010
Come on.

571
01:19:28,071 --> 01:19:31,089
- Where are the others?
- I don't know where they have gone.

572
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,925
It's okay, it's all over.
We're going home.

573
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,337
- Now, where are the others?
- Others?

574
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,450
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

575
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:42,787
The other girls,
Eileen and Becky.

576
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:51,863
Kill him, Jerry.

577
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:57,680
Come on Slausen,  I'm not playing
games with you.  Where are they?

578
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:04,165
- I don't wanna have to hurt you.
- You don't want to have to hurt me?

579
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,816
You?

580
01:20:09,964 --> 01:20:12,104
Kill him, Jerry!
Kill him!

581
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:14,751
He can't, Molly.

582
01:20:20,799 --> 01:20:21,941
No.

583
01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:37,775
No.

584
01:20:48,364 --> 01:20:50,332
This is not happening.

585
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:56,068
This is not happening.

586
01:20:56,103 --> 01:20:58,535
Oh, but it is, Molly.
Look around!

587
01:20:58,636 --> 01:20:59,871
They are alive!

588
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:05,460
No!

589
01:21:05,465 --> 01:21:06,725
All be alive, Molly!

590
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:08,704
No!

591
01:21:08,805 --> 01:21:15,308
<i>Join us,
join us ....</i>
