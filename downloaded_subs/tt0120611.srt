Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

598

It's routine research.
Heh heh.

what Frost says.

wasting your time.

their entire history.

La Magra must be
one of their legends.

00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,410
His body's
startin' to reject it.

741
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:18,960
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

742
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,420
Why do you hunt them?

743
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,680
I had a family once--

744
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,430
wife and two daughters.

745
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,150
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

746
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:38,650
a vampire.

747
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,160
He toyed with 'em first,

748
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,040
tried to make me decide

749
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,160
which order
they'd die in.

750
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,880
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

751
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,500
but it's gettin' worse.

752
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,130
Because of Frost.

753
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,220
There's somethin'
happenin'

754
00:59:58,720 --> 01:58:58,390
in the vampire ranks.

755
00:59:00,120 --> 01:00:02,140
It's somethin' big...

756
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:03,970
and I'd stake my life

757
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,970
that son of a bitch
is at the center of it.

758
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:12,730
KAREN: Blade.

759
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,460
Whistler told me
what happened.

760
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,010
He told me
what you are.

761
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,600
You don't know me.

762
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,980
You don't know
anything about me.

763
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,280
I'm not human.

764
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,240
You look human
to me--

765
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,240
Humans don't
drink blood.

766
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,790
That was
a long time ago.

767
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,250
Maybe you should
let that go.

768
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,670
I have spent
my whole life

769
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:12,380
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

770
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
It made me what I am.

771
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,270
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

772
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,230
I get a little piece
of that life back,

773
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,150
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

774
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,110
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

775
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,410
Two of them against your
entire security force?

776
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:37,910
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

777
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,740
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate--

778
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,450
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

779
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,830
Aah! You little skeez!

780
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,550
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

781
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,840
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

782
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,510
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

783
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,810
You got
what you deserved.

784
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,190
QUINN: Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

785
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,020
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

786
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,360
He took my hand again!

787
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,650
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

788
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,650
What the fuck
are you talk--

789
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,240
you want him alive?

790
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,780
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

791
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,370
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.

you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

810
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,470
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

811
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,090
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

812
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:44,100
That's OK.

It's written in blood.

It's from
The Book of Erebus.

I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

I'll figure out something.

860
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,990
So what's all this?

861
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,620
Took a trip to

01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,710
For your
miracle cure?

864
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,540
This is E.D.T.A.

865
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,670
It's an anticoagulant.

866
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,170
We use it
to treat blood clots.

867
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,550
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

868
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:39,470
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,220

I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

But maybe
you could use it

some vampire heads.

see it that way.

01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:14,130
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

921
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,930
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

922
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:21,190
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

923
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:22,690
Heh. You think the humans

924
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:25,110
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

925
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,440
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

926
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,240
And they should be.

927
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,280
You're an animal.

928
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:33,780
You're a fuckin'
maniac.

929
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,910
Look at 'em.

930
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:40,210
They're cattle,

931
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,170
pieces of meat.

932
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,250
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

933
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:46,300
Plague...

934
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,760
war...

935
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,420
famine.

936
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,840
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

937
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,890
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

938
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,350
the new race.

939
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:01,560
Looks like
your mascara's running.

940
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,650
I'm offering you a truce.

941
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,360
I want you with us.

942
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,700
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

943
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,800
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

944
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,640
Frost...

945
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,270
you're nothing
to me...

946
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:33,270
but another
dead vampire.

947
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:35,310
You're an idiot.
You know that?

948
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:38,400
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

949
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,860
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

950
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,530
Careful.

951
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,370
What do I care?

952
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,790
They're nothing
but cattle...

953
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,620
just like you said.

954
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:57,590
If you want to take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

955
01:11:58,130 --> 01:11:59,630
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

956
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:04,050
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's--

957
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,940
aah!

958
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,180
Go home.

959
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,350
It was simple.

960
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:46,770
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

961
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,230
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

962
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:51,070
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

963
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,280
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

964
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:54,820
That means that
we have to treat it

965
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,110
with gene therapy,

966
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,660
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

967
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,080
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

968
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,700
Are you sure
that's safe?

969
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,200
I have no idea,

970
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:07,080
but I don't have
a choice, do l?

971
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:10,590
You actually think
this could work?

972
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,590
On me...

973
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,340
yes.

974
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,880
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

975
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,680
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

976
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,550
from a bite
like I did.

977
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,140
He was born with it.

978
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,310
It's--it's part
of his DNA.

979
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,240
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

980
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,950
but it's gonna
take time.

981
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,370
Ah, we're out of time.

982
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:34,160
You saw what was
on that disc.

983
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,620
[Laughter]

984
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,370
[Laughs]

985
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,330
Damn.

986
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,500
Get out of here.

987
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,590
[Laughter]

988
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,260
[Chuckle]

989
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,930
[Laughter]

990
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,610
I said get out of here!

991
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,250
Nice place.

992
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,040
Took us a while
to find it!

993
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,840
Bite me
and get it over with.

994
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,100
I ain't gonna bite you.

995
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,450
Do your thing.

996
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,130
Whistler.

997
01:15:59,660 --> 02:31:59,280
Ohh.

998
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,210
Frost took her.

999
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,430
Listen to me.

1000
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,600
The disc.

1001
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,190
He decoded it.

1002
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:28,310
Frost is trying to...

1003
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,190
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

1004
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,360
There's some kind of...

1005
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,000
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

1006
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,210
La Magra.

1007
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,300
You're the key.

1008
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,470
He needs
your blood.

1009
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:57,480
The blood
of the daywalker.

1010
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,690
You're the chosen one.

1011
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,570
Listen to me, Blade.

1012
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,620
You can't
go after him.

1013
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:12,370
Bullshit.

1014
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,660
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

1015
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,580
it's all over.

1016
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,210
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

1017
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,510
[Groan]

1018
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:26,970
Shit.

1019
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,350
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

1020
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:37,140
Don't want me
coming back.

1021
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,850
We can treat
the wounds.

1022
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,950
It's too far gone.

1023
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,660
You know that.

1024
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,630
Give me your gun.

1025
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,590
No.

1026
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,470
Give me
the god-damn gun.

1027
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:25,490
Now walk away,

1028
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:28,240
you stupid
son of a bitch.

1029
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,460
Walk the fuck away.

1030
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,900
[Gun blast]

1031
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,280
By the time you watch this,

1032
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:58,990
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

1033
01:18:59,490 --> 01:18:59,950
If it makes any
difference to you,

1034
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,710
he put up
quite a fight.

1035
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,830
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

1036
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:45,070
You seem a bit...

1037
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:46,190
tense.

1038
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,240
A bit pent-up maybe,

1039
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,200
like you need to
release something.

1040
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,030
You know?

1041
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,490
Blade not...

1042
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,010
givin' it to you
maybe.

1043
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,090
I don't know.
I just...

1044
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:02,640
I see such
a beautiful woman.

1045
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:05,600
Great skin.

1046
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,150
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

1047
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,770
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

1048
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,400
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

1049
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,150
Go ahead.

1050
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:20,660
Bite me.

1051
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,700
I'll just cure myself.

1052
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,200
I did it before,

1053
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,910
and I can do it again.

1054
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:28,790
There is no cure,
baby.

1055
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,420
There is if you've
been bit,

1056
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:34,130
if you were once human.

1057
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:40,550
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

1058
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,010
A born vampire

1059
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,800
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

1060
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,060
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

1061
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,480
Isn't that right?

1062
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:52,940
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

1063
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,110
You're just...infected,
a virus...

1064
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:58,290
a sexually transmitted
disease.

1065
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,830
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

1066
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,370
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

1067
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:04,500
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

1068
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,420
you people
are fuckin' history.

1069
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,210
He's a hurricane,

1070
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,380
an act of God.

1071
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,180
Anyone caught
in his path

1072
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,720
will instantly
be turned.

1073
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,970
Everyone you've
ever known,

1074
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:21,180
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

1075
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:23,140
It won't matter
who's pureblood

1076
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,900
and who's not.

1077
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,940
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

1078
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:31,190
Hmm?

1079
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,740
And Blade's blood
is the key.

1080
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,870
We got an intruder.

1081
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,050
[Elevator bell]

1082
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:55,340
[Motorcycle engine
revving]

1083
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:05,740
[Revving loudly,
all around]

1084
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,570
[Tyres peeling]

1085
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,910
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

1086
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:10,240
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

1087
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,370
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him--

1088
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,210
and he's got shit
he throws at you--

1089
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,870
Yeah, the swords.

1090
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,250
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

1091
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:18,960
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

1092
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,420
[Over radio] There's no
intruder where we are.

1093
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,300
Look, make it happen,
all right?

1094
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:23,880
It's one guy on foot.

1095
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:30,140
That's him!
Get him!

1096
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,280
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

1097
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:54,040
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

1098
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,540
I need him alive.

1099
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,040
No!

1100
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:01,630
Please!

1101
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:03,210
I just work for them!

1102
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,060
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

1103
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,520
Yes, sir!

1104
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,520
Aah!

1105
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,100
Aieee!
Aah!

1106
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,510
Eric?

1107
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,280
But you died.

1108
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:13,710
I came back, Eric.

1109
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,500
That very same night...

1110
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,750
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

1111
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,220
[Shock blast]

1112
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,640
Uhh!

1113
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:39,320
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1114
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:40,820
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1115
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,570
and you act like this?

1116
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,280
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1117
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,450
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1118
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:49,910
Uh! Uhh!

1119
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:52,950
Don't look so surprised.

1120
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:54,660
You spent your whole life

1121
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,630
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1122
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,000
Well, here I am.

1123
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,210
Who would ever guess

1124
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:05,760
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1125
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,180
But you did.

1126
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:08,800
And here we are--

1127
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,640
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1128
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,750
I need my serum.

1129
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,420
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1130
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:30,670
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1131
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:32,710
There's one catch.

1132
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:38,220
If it works,

1133
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,590
you'll lose
your strength

1134
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:44,060
and your ability
to regenerate.

1135
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,480
You'll be
completely human.

1136
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:08,710
Uhh!

1137
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,760
FROST: Blade, Karen,

1138
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:52,760
glad you could make it.

1139
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,510
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1140
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:58,930
Our ancestors
called this place

1141
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,600
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1142
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:06,270
Nice, isn't it?

1143
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:09,150
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1144
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,990
Fortunately for us...

1145
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:13,490
I'm what you
might call a...

1146
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:16,450
student of history.

1147
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:31,850
Why are we here?

1148
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,480
This temple was built
for one glorious moment--

1149
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:41,280
this night,
for the Blood God.

1150
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:50,790
Thanks.

1151
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,670
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1152
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,340
Well.

1153
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:03,470
Titanium, right?

1154
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,890
Acid-etched?

1155
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,430
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1156
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:16,810
What?

1157
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:19,730
You look surprised.

1158
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,480
I told you, Blade,

1159
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,780
I know everything
about you.

1160
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:25,990
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1161
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:27,240
Why, man?

1162
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:28,320
These are--they're,
like, all better.

1163
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:29,670
Hold out your arm.

1164
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:31,130
Now.

1165
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,220
Deac, l--

1166
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:42,470
Just kidding.

1167
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,350
Ha ha ha ha!
He was fuckin'
with me.

1168
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:48,060
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1169
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:49,150
Blade.

1170
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:51,570
Blade.

1171
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:52,730
He can't hear you,
honey.

1172
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:54,740
The thirst has
got him now.

1173
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:02,240
What do we have here?

1174
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,120
The precious serum.

1175
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,960
Mm. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1176
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,800
12, 13 hours maybe?

1177
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,130
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1178
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:15,800
aren't you?

1179
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,510
What's it feel like?

1180
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:23,060
Is your blood on fire?

1181
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:25,480
Try some.

1182
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,230
You might like it.

1183
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,690
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1184
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:33,080
In any event,

1185
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,620
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1186
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,460
It's a shame, you know?

1187
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,050
When I think of what
you've become,

1188
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:49,760
what you should
have become.

1189
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,850
I guess
I don't blame you.

1190
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,600
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1191
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:55,100
it's the human
side of you

1192
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,810
that's made you weak.

1193
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,520
You should've listened
to your blood.

1194
01:31:58,980 --> 01:31:59,900
Say what you want,

1195
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:04,110
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1196
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:05,820
Ooh.

1197
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,240
Get him outta here.

1198
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,660
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1199
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:18,540
Come on. Let's go.

1200
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,750
Let's go.

1201
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:25,670
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1202
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:26,880
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1203
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,260
QUINN: Oh, no, baby.

1204
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,680
We got something real
special planned for you.

1205
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:34,220
QUINN: That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1206
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,640
I sucked him dry.

1207
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,440
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1208
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:38,820
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1209
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,280
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1210
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,200
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1211
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:43,660
[Imitating zombie]

1212
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,780
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1213
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,240
FROST: Pathetic.

1214
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,330
QUINN: Yeah. These guys
are complete scums, man.

1215
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,700
They'll eat anything--

1216
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,830
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1217
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:56,170
They'll even
eat vampires.

1218
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:57,880
That's a plus.

1219
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,340
And bearing that
all in mind,

1220
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,670
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1221
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,640
Uh!

1222
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:07,350
Uh!

1223
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:08,470
It's too bad.

1224
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:11,350
I kinda liked her.

1225
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:12,890
What a waste.

1226
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,250
[Moans]

1227
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:36,540
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1228
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:39,250
No pulse.

1229
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:40,600
And, of course,

1230
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,850
there's the question
of lividity.

1231
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:45,900
Curtis?

1232
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,270
Ahh.

1233
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:51,570
Karen?

1234
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,780
Karen.

1235
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:57,240
I never thought
I would see you again.

1236
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,200
Tell me, Karen,

1237
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,700
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1238
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:07,250
[Roar]

1239
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,350
Karen!

1240
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,730
Karen!

1241
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:25,440
Karen!

1242
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:28,770
Karen!

1243
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,520
Karen.

1244
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:32,980
Karen!

1245
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:39,520
Poor child.

1246
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,860
You're so sick.

1247
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:46,030
So thirsty.

1248
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,750
Don't touch me.

1249
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,790
Eric, look at me.

1250
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:56,550
Vampires are
my people now.

1251
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:59,380
I'm one of them.

1252
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,130
Can't be.

1253
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,430
Yes, it can.

1254
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:09,270
Try to understand,
Eric.

1255
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:13,650
Your mother died
a long time ago.

1256
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:17,440
I've hunted...

1257
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:20,610
I've killed...

1258
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:24,780
and I've enjoyed it.

1259
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,700
Haven't you?

1260
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:30,870
I know you have.

1261
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,290
Sooner or later,

1262
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:36,880
the thirst
always wins.

1263
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,480
Come on.

1264
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:30,400
Spread them out.

1265
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:34,150
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1266
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:36,360
Make it perfect.

1267
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,790
Yeah.

1268
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,710
FROST:
Bring the elevator up.

1269
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,570
[Thunder]

1270
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,180
VAMPIRE:
You stupid girl.

1271
01:39:00,680 --> 03:18:01,020
What do you think
is going to happen?

1272
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:02,390
La Magra?

1273
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:03,760
The Blood God?

1274
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,390
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1275
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:07,560
for pretty
little vampires.

1276
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,850
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1277
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:12,770
You're afraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1278
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:15,360
your pureblood spirit.

1279
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,400
You should be.
