1
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,184
I don't know, he just seems to be
working us a lot harder lately.

2
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:23,092
Practices are getting a lot rougher
and a lot of exercise and a lot of running.

3
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:27,226
You know how I love running. I don't know.

4
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:30,846
Yeah, I heard there was a party going on
tonight, I don't know if I want to go.

5
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:34,533
I don't know if I want to sit
around Robbie's basement

6
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,160
while you guys make out
in the laundry room.

7
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:40,773
Which Mark, Mark Mendola?

8
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:45,010
It doesn't matter.
I'm babysitting. Yes, again.

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,880
I don't know maybe. How late
are you gonna be hanging out?

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,648
- Hi, sorry.
- I gotta go.

11
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,716
Do you know where the post office is?

12
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:55,888
The post office?
I'm not real good with directions.

13
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:59,959
Oh, hey. Can you help this lady
get to the post office?

14
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,351
- Are you Anna?
- Yeah!

15
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:13,179
Jacob, can you come down here?

16
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,266
Your dad should be home
any minute with a new sitter.

17
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:24,360
Get down here and help me
with your brother.

18
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,611
Bye, Mom!

19
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,394
Hi.

20
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,763
- You must be Anna.
- And you're Mr. Thompson?

21
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:55,325
- Yeah, yeah, call me Dan though.
- It's so nice to meet you.

22
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,472
Yeah, Maggie has been a lot less reliable
since she got her braces off.

23
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:02,866
I don't know what's going on with that.

24
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:09,459
It's me and my wife's anniversary tonight,
so you're really saving our butts here.

25
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:13,593
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you. Thank you.

26
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:18,510
So, the kids have had play dates
with the Abbott girls.

27
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,853
Ashley and... what's the little
quiet one's name?

28
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:29,600
- I forget.
- I just call them sleepy and grumpy.

29
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,404
Sleepy and grumpy, that's good.

30
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:36,908
Yeah, well, our kids,
they tend to be more energetic.

31
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:39,578
They're good kids, great kids.

32
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,167
They're just...

33
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,882
And then there's...
then there's our oldest.

34
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:48,107
He's 11, he just started
middle school and...

35
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,689
you know... stones are dropping.

36
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,693
- You know what I mean?
- It's okay, I can handle an 11 year old.

37
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:59,131
Yeah, Maggie said you were
quite the... child herder.

38
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,626
You got a Facebook page and everything.

39
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,873
- Did you see my page?
- No, no. I don't...

40
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,339
I barely go on the computer.

41
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:14,012
Yeah, I don't have one of those.
It's a little too much sharing.

42
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:16,209
But Joyce might've.

43
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,456
And what age are the other two?

44
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:28,927
Sally just turned 9,
she just had her birthday.

45
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:32,864
And Christopher is 4.

46
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:35,634
He's a... he's a cute little guy.

47
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,303
He won't give you much of a problem.

48
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,296
They're good ages.

49
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:47,235
- Give it back, Christopher!
- Boys, slow it down.

50
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,084
Mama?

51
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:56,054
- Is the new babysitter a girl?
- Yes, she's a girl.

52
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,924
Because I like it when I'm not
the only one all the time.

53
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,083
- You can't catch me!
- Guys!

54
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,468
You guys. No, no, no. No jumping.
Come on, keep it downstairs.

55
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:12,344
Jacob! Hey!

56
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:15,941
- Jacob!
- I'm okay, Mommy.

57
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,960
- Little idiot!
- Jacob.

58
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,813
- You know what?
- What?

59
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,005
Hand it over.

60
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,085
Jacob!

61
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:29,354
- Hand it over!
- He won't leave me alone!

62
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,356
The kid won't leave me alone,
it's not my fault.

63
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:33,314
Give me the game.

64
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,095
- Till the weekend.
- For what?

65
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:39,398
I can't keep doing this with you.

66
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:42,100
You want me to keep paying
for babysitters till you're in college?

67
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,936
Yes.

68
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:48,707
Like it or not, you're the big brother,
and I need you step up.

69
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,111
You're not a little anymore.

70
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,580
- Jakey's gotta take care of us.
- Shut it, meat bag.

71
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,373
Hey!

72
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:02,354
<i>Hey, Jake. Jake, you there?</i>

73
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:06,224
- <i>Pick up!</i>
- Hey. Yeah. Howie. What do you want?

74
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:08,993
<i>Wanna come watch me play
The New Dark Realm?</i>

75
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:12,920
No, no, I can't. Getting babysat tonight.

76
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,969
<i>Maggie's coming over?
She so fine now she got her braces off.</i>

77
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,680
No, not Maggie. Someone new.

78
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,341
Her best friend or something.

79
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:25,944
<i>My mom let's me watch my sister
after school till she gets home from work</i>

80
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,980
- <i>and I'm born three months after you.</i>
- Good for you.

81
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,517
<i>Hey, so, remember how my cousins
went on vacation to Nevada?</i>

82
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:36,321
<i>Well, they brought me back something
that's gonna blow your hole.</i>

83
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,458
- What is it?
- <i>I stashed it in your tree house.</i>

84
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,828
- <i>Meet me there after bedtime.</i>
- Alright.

85
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,565
I'll think about it.

86
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,748
<i>Over and out.</i>

87
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,891
Hon?

88
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,995
Hon, how we doing?

89
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:56,508
Hon? Okay.

90
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,343
Hi, I'm Joyce.

91
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:01,713
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
Your house is beautiful.

92
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,815
Sorry it's kind of a mess.

93
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,635
- I'll be right down.
- Okay.

94
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,957
- Can I get a hug before we go?
- Daddy!

95
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:16,334
Thank you. Thank you. I'll miss you, too.

96
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:20,632
- You smell funny, Dad.
- It's Cologne. Your mom got it for me.

97
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:23,935
- What's cologne?
- It's like perfume for Daddies.

98
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:27,138
Okay, guys. This is Anna,
she's your babysitter for tonight.

99
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,908
- Anna!
- Hi.

100
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,544
- I'm Sally.
- And I'm Christopher!

101
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:35,946
- That's my brother Christopher.
- Hey, Christopher.

102
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:43,054
- Oh, who's that guy?
- That's Glow Nose.

103
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:44,489
Glow Nose. Okay.

104
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,012
- He was my... No, he was Jake's...
- He was my...

105
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:51,196
...when he was a little kid, and then
he was Sally's, and now he's mine.

106
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,969
- He looks like he's had a lot of love.
- Yes, he does.

107
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:08,447
Chris and Sal are babies.
I don't need her here.

108
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:13,698
You know, this a really special night
for your mom and me.

109
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:18,288
When are you gonna be back?

110
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,989
You'll be asleep.

111
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,611
Get downstairs and meet the new sitter.

112
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,907
They already ate dinner but if they
get hungry they can have a snack.

113
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:39,144
There's cookies, crackers,
gummies are in the cupboard.

114
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:43,081
There should be some baby carrots
in the crisper. Yes, there are.

115
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,984
- I left the number for the restaurant...
- I have a pet hamster.

116
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:48,987
- And the number for my cell phone.
- His name's Admiral Wubbles.

117
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,585
Yeah? You'll have to introduce me.

118
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:54,993
- Do the kids have their own phones?
- "No cell phones till high school."

119
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:59,664
That's right, family rule. But feel free to
call my cell anytime, with any questions.

120
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:01,600
- Okay.
- He's coming down.

121
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,998
What else does she need to know?

122
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:05,904
Let's see.

123
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:10,141
They will probably try to convince you
to let them play in the garage.

124
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:12,826
- Do not let them.
- What's in the garage?

125
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:16,081
A '73 Corvette Stingray Coupe
that I restored myself.

126
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,412
- So...
- Nice.

127
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,986
Yeah. Yeah, I had it bored
and stroked to a 383.

128
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,556
- Got about 400 horsepower in that...
- I thought we were in a rush?

129
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:29,895
Yeah, yeah, we are.
And we're taking the minivan.

130
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,464
So, bedtime is nine o'clock.

131
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:37,002
Jacob can stay up till 9:30
but only to read.

132
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:39,871
They so should go down easy
because we had soccer practice today.

133
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:42,441
This one had ballet.

134
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,676
Any allergies or medications
I should know about?

135
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:48,846
- No, nothing like that.
- Nope, good genes.

136
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,982
You have to watch Christopher
brush his teeth.

137
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,485
Otherwise he just eats the toothpaste.

138
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:56,521
There he is. This is Jake, our oldest.

139
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:00,412
- Jake, this is Anna, the new sitter.
- Hi, Jake.

140
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:04,029
Say hello.

141
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,232
- Hey.
- A wealth of conversation.

142
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:12,503
He's mad at me because I took away his...
what is it called, hand-held DX thing.

143
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,706
Where is my good coat?
Is it upstairs or where is it?

144
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,408
Right in front of you.

145
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,987
Alright, kids, gather around.
Where's Christopher?

146
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:22,747
- Christopher!
- It's your anniversary!

147
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,335
- Say goodnight.
- Goodnight.

148
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,552
- Nighty night!
- Alright, listen up, you three.

149
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,455
Anna here is in charge, okay?

150
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:33,391
You be good and do what she says. Capiche?

151
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:37,062
- Ka-peach.
- Ka-peach, ka-peach, ka-peach!

152
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:39,564
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

153
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:42,067
- Home by eleven.
- Enjoy your meal. Happy anniversary!

154
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,236
- Thank you. Bye guys, I love you!
- Love you.

155
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:46,610
Love you, too!

156
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,399
What shall we play?

157
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,746
- Do you want to draw?
- No.

158
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:58,024
What do you want to do?
We could play board games?

159
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:07,358
- We could do make-up.
- No! I'm a boy!

160
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,694
Can we get ice cream?

161
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:15,500
Oh, let's play dress-up!

162
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,456
Yes, let's play dress-up!

163
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,780
You coming, Jacob?

164
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,308
Don't bother.
Jacob never plays with us anymore.

165
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,252
Dress-up's for girls, Chris.

166
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,694
Okay, what dress should I wear?

167
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:45,296
- This one, this one, or this one?
- That one!

168
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:47,832
- Which?
- This one.

169
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,000
- Right?
- That's awesome!

170
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,870
That's the best darn dress
that I ever saw!

171
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,838
And then she becomes queen.

172
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,841
And so then they can't decide
who's gonna be queen again...

173
00:12:56,941 --> 00:13:00,078
So why don't they play 'rock
paper scissors says shoot?'

174
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,247
- They can't play rock paper scissors.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:05,784
And so then they decide
that they're both gonna rule together.

176
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,686
Hey, guys.

177
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,530
What if I told you...

178
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,217
that you don't have to be a boy,
or a girl, or a human,

179
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:16,394
or really anything?

180
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,997
You can be whatever you wanted.

181
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:23,059
And all you had to do was pretend.

182
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:28,873
Because pretending is this...
super power we all have.

183
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:33,094
When we pretend,
we can be anyone we want to be.

184
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,882
When you get really good at it...

185
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,751
people won't even know
you're pretending anymore.

186
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,812
- I wanna play pretend!
- Good.

187
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:09,551
Cool room.

188
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:14,710
It's alright.

189
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,644
Lemur-boy?

190
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:30,035
You ever read Death Vice?

191
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:34,371
No. Mom and Dad say it's too violent.

192
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:39,720
Well, your parents aren't here
right now, are they?

193
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,402
See ya later?

194
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:04,303
I never feel great leaving them
with someone we don't know.

195
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,739
I thought Anna seemed
like a very nice girl.

196
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,060
Yeah, I noticed.

197
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,262
The kids are gonna be fine, okay?

198
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:21,552
Jan Abbott said that Anna
is great with her girls

199
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:24,123
and we both know that they're nightmares.

200
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,691
Tonight's about us.

201
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:30,345
Thirteen years.

202
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,346
Our marriage is a teenager.

203
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,602
I think we deserve a night off.

204
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,696
I agree.

205
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,376
- New dress?
- Yes. Now you notice.

206
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:48,012
I... I noticed before.

207
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:52,503
It just took a little while
for the Polaroid to develop.

208
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:56,161
Thank you.

209
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,912
I am Princess Petalsong.

210
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:07,031
My leaves are vibrant, my fruit is tart,

211
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:08,933
and my roots run deep.

212
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:12,003
She's from enchanted forest. On toon tube?

213
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:15,761
Mommy bought it for me.
It's my favorite show.

214
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:21,163
What a big scary Bronto!

215
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,915
- Look how the floor shakes when he moves.
- What the heck?

216
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,870
Were those mommy's good pillows?

217
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,256
- What'd you stuff it with?
- Sweatshirts.

218
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,292
Now this is pretending.

219
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:37,896
Not some out-of-a-bag get-up
your mom bought you.

220
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,966
He ruined Mommy's good pillows!

221
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:45,201
Sometimes it's okay
to destroy things for fun.

222
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:48,907
Good job, Christosaurus.

223
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:53,062
Jacob!

224
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,547
Daddy's old uniform!

225
00:16:56,647 --> 00:17:00,351
- Jacob's gonna do pretend with us!
- Leave me alone.

226
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,020
Just get off of me.

227
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,123
Anna, we're not allowed
to play with this stuff.

228
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:07,319
Well, Sal...

229
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:10,553
Mom and Dad aren't here, are they?

230
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,171
That's right.

231
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,287
No fair.

232
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:22,907
Hey, you were supposed to be
pretending to be something, too!

233
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,854
I already am.

234
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,080
What do you mean?

235
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:32,501
I'm a photographer.

236
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:38,030
Yeah, I travel around the world
taking photos of amazing creatures.

237
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:43,894
- Hey, Christopher, what do dinosaurs do?
- Sit down and eat meat!

238
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:46,081
That's right.

239
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,633
Smile.

240
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:53,195
Alright, give us a twirl, Princess.

241
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,142
Beautiful.

242
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:01,794
Stand up. Come on, big boy.

243
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,420
Alright, stand together.
Raise that trophy over your head.

244
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,058
But not like you're victorious, like you're
going to smash it on top of her.

245
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,336
Sally, stop smiling.

246
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:20,804
Stop smiling.

247
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,075
Good.

248
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,692
- Did you do this?
- Yeah, I did that.

249
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,994
When did you have time to do that?

250
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:29,000
I had enough time on my lunch break
to run them here from Vinnie's.

251
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,969
- Vinnie!
- Remember Vinnie? Yeah.

252
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,305
- Vinnie.
- Vinnie was 75 when we first met him.

253
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:38,665
- How old is he?
- Vinnie was 75. So he's a 104 now.

254
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,645
Remember what he said?

255
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:43,731
- I don't remember what he said.
- "Red is for the passion.

256
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,580
White is for the longevity."

257
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:49,220
That's right.

258
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,701
- We got that.
- We got them both.

259
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:55,666
- I don't want to play this anymore.
- Yeah, let's play a different game.

260
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:59,063
Alright. How about hide & seek? Not it!

261
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:01,399
- Not it!
- Not it! Jake's it!

262
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,469
No. No, no, I'm not playing.

263
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,339
I'm not... I'm not playing.
I don't want to play.

264
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:12,267
Come on, Jake. Don't you want to find me?

265
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,523
One hundred... ninety-nine...

266
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:30,084
Ninety-eight... ninety-seven...

267
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,588
No peeking.

268
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,772
Ninety-eight,

269
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:44,242
ninety-seven,

270
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,044
ninety-six,

271
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:49,213
ninety-five...

272
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:31,122
seventy, sixty-nine,

273
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:32,714
sixty-eight...

274
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,450
fifty-four, fifty-three,

275
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,269
fifty-two, fifty-one,

276
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,213
fifty...

277
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,985
thirty-six, thirty-five,

278
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:38,530
thirty-four, thirty-three...

279
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:52,837
Ten, nine,

280
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:54,918
eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one!

281
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:59,039
Ready or not, here I come!

282
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:12,180
Now where could they be?

283
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,613
You found me.

284
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,537
Jake?

285
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,633
Jacob?

286
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,597
Hey.

287
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:22,913
Hey, will you find me a new tampon?

288
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:25,796
A what?

289
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,186
I have my period.

290
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:33,254
You know what that is, right?

291
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,173
Yeah.

292
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:38,901
So, where does your mom keep her stuff?

293
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:46,308
This?

294
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:52,435
No, that's for when your mom
has an infection.

295
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,288
Look for Pamtax.

296
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:05,801
Which color?

297
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:09,734
Green.

298
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:15,637
Can you open it for me?

299
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:19,274
Okay.

300
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:42,197
Thank you.

301
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:10,058
Oh, man!

302
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:17,024
<i>Jake. Come in, Jake.</i>

303
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:18,950
<i>Jake!</i>

304
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:24,516
<i>Jake. Come in, bro.</i>

305
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:31,465
<i>Dude, you gotta come see this stuff.</i>

306
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:35,649
Howie...

307
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:38,796
<i>Yo.</i>

308
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:41,741
I think I just saw my first China hole.

309
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:48,072
You know eventually we're going
to have to have 'the talk' with him.

310
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:50,975
What talk?

311
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,078
'The talk'.

312
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:57,998
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No. I don't want to think about that.

313
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:00,985
I don't even like picturing him
with armpit hair.

314
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:02,953
You know the little Stevie
kid down the street,

315
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:06,290
he's got the little starter mustache
going on. Yeah.

316
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,395
It's just a weird time, especially
if you're the last one to sprout.

317
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,823
You think they're making fun of him?

318
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,502
They better not be. I will punch them in
the face if they're making fun of my baby.

319
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:21,338
- Joyce...
- He's my baby!

320
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:24,942
Well, your baby has a pretty
interesting browsing history.

321
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,286
Hey! Give it back!

322
00:27:27,386 --> 00:27:29,847
I already dipped the feet!

323
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:32,950
Anna! Tell him to give it back!

324
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,420
- Don't be a drama queen, Sally.
- Yeah, Sal. Really?

325
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,957
- Christopher!
- Just get a different cookie.

326
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:43,427
- Chill out, okay?
- But I had a whole cookie family

327
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:46,263
and then the papa was about
to take them to the pond,

328
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:50,217
- and now no one else can drive stick!
- Anyone can drive stick.

329
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:52,836
There's a whole package
of cookies here, so...

330
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:55,172
- pick a different papa.
- Yeah, pick a different one.

331
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:56,769
Yeah, Sal,

332
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:00,430
there's a whole pack of cookies.

333
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:03,580
Yep, look at all of these...

334
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,516
Jacob!

335
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:11,121
- So many cookies.
- Anna! Do something!

336
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,990
Lots of options.

337
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,554
Can I have one? Please.

338
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,766
I want juice.

339
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:25,613
- You have juice.
- I want that juice.

340
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,765
- Go get it yourself.
- Okay.

341
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:37,314
You know now that your DNA
is all over those cookies...

342
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:40,884
- you're gonna have to eat all of them.
- No fair!

343
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,382
Really?

344
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:46,857
I mean it. Eat them all.

345
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:49,751
- Go.
- What?

346
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,023
They yummy?

347
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:57,581
This is a loada B!

348
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:12,082
Can I have some milk?

349
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:14,934
Not till you finish those cookies.

350
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:33,496
Best babysitter...

351
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,975
Hey, what's your favorite color?

352
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:39,143
Black.

353
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:41,812
- Black?
- Yeah.

354
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:44,194
That's my favorite color, too.

355
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:51,621
Hey, how about we go cheer up your sister?

356
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:53,514
Yeah.

357
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,540
Man, which of you guys put
the wrong cap on the marker?

358
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,477
- How's that masterpiece coming?
- Good.

359
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:16,213
It's the right one.

360
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,448
See there's blue under the green cap.

361
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:21,176
And now I've got a blue flower stem.

362
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:45,943
Hey, Jacob.

363
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:50,013
- If you open your mind I'll tell you...
- Fascinating.

364
00:30:50,113 --> 00:30:53,017
So, this the flower queen.

365
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:56,720
- Queen!
- And then this is the princess.

366
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,356
- Who is the king?
- There isn't a king.

367
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:02,283
- The royal family.
- It's a queendom.

368
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:07,740
Hey, Anna, check this out.

369
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:09,933
Yeah.

370
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:14,204
- Christopher, what's this?
- Attack of the killer olives!

371
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,039
What happened to that guy?

372
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:19,109
You mean this guy? He got
stepped on by the monster's toe claw.

373
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:25,043
That's the toe claw and this where
he chewed off his legs and arms.

374
00:31:25,143 --> 00:31:27,601
Hey, Anna, wanna help me feed my python?

375
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:29,753
- Can we come, too?
- I don't wanna go.

376
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:33,156
No, you guys know the rules.
Just me and Anna.

377
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:37,294
- Please?
- Yeah, he's right. We're too little.

378
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:40,564
- You know, that's just rude.
- Fine.

379
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:43,400
- I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
- We'll all go. Come on.

380
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,003
No. I'm not going.

381
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:49,539
I don't wanna see the python! Please!

382
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:06,123
- Can I hold the mouse?
- No.

383
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:07,825
- Please.
- Nope.

384
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,226
- Can I feed the snake?
- Nope.

385
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,623
- Why not?
- Because you suck.

386
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,278
Hey. Jake.

387
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:20,931
In the wild, these animals are hunters.
They always devour their prey alive.

388
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:22,807
Warm.

389
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:26,110
This is cold.

390
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,536
But this...

391
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:34,042
- is warm.
- Admiral Wubbles?

392
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,855
What's he doing here?

393
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:39,856
Tonight I think Drake
deserves a special treat.

394
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:42,692
- Cool!
- No. No, no.

395
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:46,864
- Drake's gonna eat Sally's hamster?
- No, he is not!

396
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,967
You know, I've never seen Drake
eat anything that big, Sal.

397
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:53,556
- That's not funny!
- Let's see.

398
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,966
- No!
- Hey!

399
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:04,046
- Yeah, yeah, you wanna get him?
- Get out the way! Move it, Jacob!

400
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:07,753
Nope. No. Can't get pass me.

401
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,284
- Christopher, what are you...
- No, no, no! Christopher, no!

402
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:25,168
Get him out! Stop! Stop!

403
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:27,104
Get him outta there, Jake!

404
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:30,931
- Yeah, we should get him out...
- Wait. Just watch.

405
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,778
He's scared.

406
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:37,038
No!

407
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,085
Get him out!

408
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,187
Let go!

409
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:46,790
Get off of me!

410
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,774
Do something, Jake! Please!

411
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,389
Let go!

412
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:29,461
No!

413
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,789
I'm sorry, Sal.

414
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,958
Don't be sorry.

415
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:57,085
Everyone dies at some point.

416
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:18,782
Okay, I'm really bad
at keeping this secret.

417
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:21,467
I was gonna wait till dessert but...

418
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:24,328
since you busted out the champagne...

419
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,756
Happy anniversary.

420
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:33,831
Alright. Coupons for those mittens
that I wanted to get, right?

421
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:36,924
- Slippers?
- Open it.

422
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:47,144
The Nascar Sprint Cup?

423
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:50,247
Two seats. 'Pit terrace,'
the guy aid those were the best.

424
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:53,984
Yeah. Yeah. They are the best.

425
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:57,220
- How did you... How did you even...
- Don't worry about it.

426
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,672
I've been putting away for this
for a while. I got hooked up.

427
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:04,417
And you deserve it.

428
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:07,870
You deserve it.

429
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:11,558
You're the best.

430
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:26,571
You know who's gonna
freak out about this? Pete.

431
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:30,020
He's gonna flip his lid
when he hears about this.

432
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,490
He's been talking about this
for three or four months now.

433
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,986
I was kinda thinking you might take, Jake.

434
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:41,686
Yeah.

435
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:45,335
- Of course... it's stupid of me...
- I mean... it's not stupid.

436
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,871
...not think about taking Jake. I just...

437
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:50,907
You just haven't had a lot
of time together lately.

438
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:52,742
I think he needs it.

439
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:56,313
And I thought that would be
a fun way to spend time together.

440
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,844
Screw Pete.

441
00:37:11,294 --> 00:37:15,633
Hey. Come on, look who's here.

442
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:19,003
Look who's here.

443
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,163
You want him?

444
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:27,177
It's okay.

445
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,670
We'll get more Wubbles.

446
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:36,419
Wipe away the tears.

447
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,756
Wipe away them!

448
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:42,659
Come on, wipe away those tears.

449
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:46,970
Where's the big Sally I know?
Where is she?

450
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,400
Where is the old Sal?

451
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,861
Soaked.

452
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:58,108
Where is the old Sally I know?

453
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:02,005
Where is she? Is she still here?

454
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,644
Kids, movie time.

455
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:09,386
Come on. It's movie time!

456
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,930
It's movie time.

457
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:17,351
- Come on.
- What are we watching?

458
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,109
I hate movies.

459
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:36,746
<i>I don't know what's wrong,
it won't turn off...</i>

460
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:39,139
No, you're with me.

461
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:44,211
- Jake, where are you going?
- Bathroom.

462
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:49,359
- It's Mommy.
- That's not Mommy.

463
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,728
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

464
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,963
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

465
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,865
<i>Just trying out the camera.</i>

466
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:58,201
<i>Get over here.
I want to take your pants off.</i>

467
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:00,370
Daddy's naked!

468
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,884
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

469
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:32,469
<i>Oh, my God, you're so hard right now.</i>

470
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:39,967
Jacob!

471
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,609
Jacob!

472
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,804
Howie?

473
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:20,049
Howie?

474
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:22,785
- <i>Go to bed, Jacob.</i>
- Mrs. Parker?

475
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:25,021
<i>Howie's had his walkie taken away.</i>

476
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:28,057
<i>Supposed to be doing his homework
and he's out doing God-knows-what.</i>

477
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,683
<i>Go to bed, Jacob.</i>

478
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:35,521
Mrs. Parker, there's something wrong
with the new babysitter.

479
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:43,997
Mrs. Parker?

480
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:46,667
Crap.

481
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:28,643
That's private!

482
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,257
Alright.

483
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:36,710
Well, I think it's time for bed.

484
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,719
Come on, babe.

485
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,109
"Once upon a time...

486
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:04,912
in a faraway land lived a mama bear
and her little cubbie.

487
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,883
They lived in a cave in a snowy forest.

488
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,887
<i>Mama bear loved her cubbie so much.</i>

489
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:26,067
<i>He made her smile in a way
mama bear never thought she could.</i>

490
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:33,650
- Mama bear worked very..."
- This book is strange.

491
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,424
You're strange, Sally.

492
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:39,889
"Mama bear worked very hard to pay..."

493
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:43,026
- It's my night to pick the story!
- Then shut up and listen!

494
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:46,079
- Is that my mom's bracelet?
- Get out! Get out!

495
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:48,195
You get out!

496
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:02,136
"Mama bear worked real hard
to pay for food, and the cave.

497
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,652
<i>When she came home at night
and saw her cubbie's chubby little face,</i>

498
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:10,944
<i>it just made it all worth it.</i>

499
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:17,785
<i>And then one day mama bear
made a mistake...</i>

500
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,191
<i>and her cubbie died.</i>

501
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:37,255
This made mama bear very sad.

502
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:41,751
She missed her cubbie so much...

503
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:44,545
that her mind cracked.

504
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:51,818
<i>It didn't break, it didn't break.
It just cracked.</i>

505
00:43:58,267 --> 00:44:00,870
And then mama met a skinny hyena.

506
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,640
His mind was cracked
worse than mama bear's

507
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,109
but he liked her a real lot

508
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,451
<i>and said he'd help her
make a new cubbie...</i>

509
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,068
but it didn't work.

510
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:17,622
Mama bear's insides were twisted shut...

511
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:23,757
and the rulers of the kingdom
wouldn't give mama bear a new cubbie,

512
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,954
even when she asked nice."

513
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:31,815
That's mean.

514
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,510
I think so, too.

515
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:42,845
"Mama bear and the skinny hyena were angry

516
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:45,715
<i>and they got into some trouble,</i>

517
00:44:45,915 --> 00:44:49,018
<i>so they decided to escape to a new land</i>

518
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:51,511
<i>and become new animals.</i>

519
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:05,497
<i>And began their search for a new cubbie.</i>

520
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,201
<i>But it couldn't just be any cubbie.</i>

521
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,968
<i>It had to be her cubbie.</i>

522
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,178
And then they searched..."

523
00:45:26,155 --> 00:45:28,524
What happens next?

524
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,353
I don't know.

525
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:35,898
What do you think should happen?

526
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:40,293
I want mama bear to find a new cubbie
so that she can smile like that again.

527
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:52,555
She's trying.

528
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,350
Jacob, Sally, time for bed!

529
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,881
Hey, Sal.

530
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:37,104
Sal, what are you doing?
Get into your pj's.

531
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,261
It's Daddy's gun.

532
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:47,337
Don't.

533
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:50,047
The babysitter left it out.

534
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:59,372
She's no babysitter.

535
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:05,596
No real babysitter
would give us a gun to play with.

536
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:10,494
Or show us private movies.

537
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:13,796
Her name's not even Anna.

538
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:16,143
What?

539
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,821
It's Emelie.

540
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:34,254
Who's Emelie?

541
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:44,239
You're a liar...

542
00:47:47,146 --> 00:47:48,695
and I know it.

543
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:51,959
I don't know what you're talking about.

544
00:47:57,073 --> 00:47:59,300
Are you gonna shoot me?

545
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:09,142
Shoot me.

546
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:14,015
Shoot me!

547
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,029
What you guys doing?

548
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:22,941
Nothing.

549
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:35,825
Give me the gun.

550
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:41,218
- Can't you just leave us alone?
- I'm not gonna say it twice.

551
00:48:42,618 --> 00:48:45,254
- Christopher.
- Christopher!

552
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:48,824
- Hey. Hey.
- It's not a toy, Christopher!

553
00:48:48,924 --> 00:48:50,984
Hey, give me the gun.

554
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:58,456
No escape from Chase Hunter.

555
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,897
Give Mommy the gun.

556
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:20,765
I knew it was you.

557
00:49:29,598 --> 00:49:33,911
No! Hey! No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop!

558
00:49:34,111 --> 00:49:36,906
Stop. Okay?

559
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:40,867
Inside. Christopher? Christopher!

560
00:49:44,213 --> 00:49:47,550
I do not know who that is
but I do not want to hear one word

561
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,585
about all the games we've been playing.

562
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:53,046
- I've been nice to you guys so far.
- You haven't been nice at all.

563
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:58,339
That is what happens when you misbehave.

564
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:05,206
Now I want you to stay here and be quiet
until I come back, do you understand?

565
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:08,269
Do you understand!

566
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:48,701
Who are you?

567
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,380
I'm the babysitter.

568
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,850
No, you're not.

569
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,952
Of course I am. Who are you?

570
00:50:57,052 --> 00:51:01,557
I'm Maggie. You know,
the Thompson's usual sitter?

571
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:04,118
See, I was supposed
to watch the kids tonight but...

572
00:51:04,218 --> 00:51:06,754
this guy I know that goes to college
asked if I wanted to hang out

573
00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:08,672
and I've been wanting to hang out
with him so I couldn't say no.

574
00:51:08,772 --> 00:51:11,065
I called my friend Anna to see
if she could babysit for me

575
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,302
and she said she would and I've been
texting to see how it's been going

576
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:16,305
but Anna hasn't gotten back to me which
is weird 'cause she's like the most...

577
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:19,475
- It's Maggie!
- Maggie.

578
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:21,784
...the last thing she posted
was that she was coming here

579
00:51:21,884 --> 00:51:25,013
and since then she hasn't posted anything
so I thought I'd come by on my way back

580
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:27,124
to make sure everything's okay
but then like, you're here

581
00:51:27,224 --> 00:51:30,811
and she's not and I'm kinda like,
WTF is going on.

582
00:51:34,723 --> 00:51:36,225
Right, Maggie.

583
00:51:36,325 --> 00:51:37,544
Yeah.

584
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:41,228
So you're a friend of Anna?

585
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:44,472
Yeah. She got sick. Food poisoning.

586
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:48,805
And the Thompson's called me.
They're a family friend.

587
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,242
Well, do you think I could
just say hi for a second?

588
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:56,312
No! No. You know what, they're asleep.

589
00:51:56,412 --> 00:51:59,548
Come on. They never go down on time.
I won't tell Dan and Joyce, I promise.

590
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:03,804
No. You know what?
Stay there. I'll get them.

591
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:07,437
Sally, Jake, Christopher!

592
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:32,248
Is that Maggie?

593
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,818
Yeah. And you like Maggie.

594
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:39,649
You wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to her, right?

595
00:52:41,857 --> 00:52:45,094
Okay, stand up. Stand up.

596
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:49,154
Okay. Go. Come on.

597
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,857
We're friends, right?

598
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:54,776
Come on. Come on.

599
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:04,513
Hey, doodies!

600
00:53:04,613 --> 00:53:07,283
Hi, Maggie.

601
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:11,079
- You guys having fun with the new sitter?
- Yes.

602
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,908
What have you guys been doing?

603
00:53:16,008 --> 00:53:17,801
Playing.

604
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:22,767
Pythons prefer live prey.

605
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:27,561
Kids.

606
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:35,878
Anna literally like, just texted me.

607
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:40,830
She is sick. And she called and canceled.

608
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,419
Well... I guess I better
get going, okay, guys?

609
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,722
- No, Maggie, don't go!
- Yeah, please stay and play with us!

610
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:48,457
I have a life of my own, ya know!

611
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:50,659
But I see you guys in like,
two days so we'll play then.

612
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:53,095
- No, wait!
- Hey...

613
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:56,999
Hi! What's this?

614
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:59,655
I just... love you, that's all.

615
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,507
- Bye, Maggie!
- Okay. Bye, guys.

616
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:07,499
Get in.

617
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:21,897
Go over there. Sit down.

618
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,912
No, no, no, where I can see you.

619
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:19,174
- Drink.
- Why is the juice dark blue?

620
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:22,179
It's gonna give you good dreams. So drink.

621
00:56:27,613 --> 00:56:30,643
Stop it! Please.

622
00:56:33,922 --> 00:56:37,292
Good. Come on. Come on!

623
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:40,562
Hey. Hey! No, you already
had... get outta here!

624
00:56:40,662 --> 00:56:43,020
What are you doing? Don't you dare.

625
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,809
- Don't you dare.
- That's my bite!

626
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:48,937
- You've had more than your half, sir.
- Your half is in your stomach already.

627
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:51,670
Wait. Wait.

628
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,308
- What's the matter?
- I never called Anna.

629
00:56:55,404 --> 00:56:57,212
I never called Anna.
I told her I'd call her.

630
00:56:57,312 --> 00:57:00,048
Yeah, it's bed time, too. You better
call her. I'm worried about her.

631
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:02,050
- Will you get me...
- With those kids.

632
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:05,308
Will you get the bill?
I'm going to just give her a call.

633
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:09,725
Hey, you ready to go to sleep?

634
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:13,495
Where's Jake? Where's Jake?

635
00:57:13,595 --> 00:57:15,841
He's upstairs in bed.

636
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:45,472
Hello?

637
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:48,535
Hey, Joyce.
Yeah, they went out like a light.

638
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:51,699
- <i>I hope they didn't give you too much trouble.</i>
- No problem at all.

639
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:55,526
- <i>That's good. I'm proud of them.</i>
- Oh, they're so good.

640
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:58,867
- Well behaved.
- <i>Thanks. Did they need to eat anything?</i>

641
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:03,038
Well, they did, they ate...
they ate some snacks.

642
00:59:03,138 --> 00:59:07,026
- <i>Oh, good. Not too much sugar.</i>
- Nothing... nothing too big.

643
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:10,979
- It sounds like you guys enjoyed your meal.
- <i>Yes, it was delicious.</i>

644
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:12,848
<i>I can't believe I've never been here.</i>

645
00:59:12,948 --> 00:59:15,674
- <i>It's a terrific place.</i>
- Good.

646
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,087
Great. Well, that's good.

647
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:22,753
<i>I meant to ask you, can you make sure you
leave the hall light on for Christopher?</i>

648
00:59:22,853 --> 00:59:27,028
Yeah, I will do... I will do that,
but no worries at all.

649
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:32,000
<i>We're just getting the bill right now
so we'll be home in about twenty minutes.</i>

650
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,535
Okay.

651
00:59:33,635 --> 00:59:37,105
- Yeah. Sorry. Wait, say that again?
- <i>I don't know what we'd do without you.</i>

652
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:41,319
- <i>You saved out night.</i>
- Great. Absolutely.

653
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:46,238
Yeah. That's great.

654
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:49,251
- Okay.
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>

655
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:52,712
Mom? Mom? Mom?

656
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:04,120
Time to go, little cubbie.

657
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:56,177
Howie! Howie, thank gosh!

658
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:58,880
Dude, check it out.
Fourth of July up in here!

659
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,499
Howie, do you have your cell phone?

660
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:03,952
Hey, I thought we might stick them
in Becky's mom's...

661
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:05,821
Howie, shut up!

662
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:08,543
There's something wrong
with the new sitter.

663
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,593
We need more time.

664
01:02:32,113 --> 01:02:35,750
You're not listening, Howie!
She hurt Maggie really bad.

665
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,920
And she's got this weird obsession
over Christopher.

666
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,056
She has my dad's gun, okay?

667
01:02:41,156 --> 01:02:43,838
I think she's trying to kill us!
You gotta help...

668
01:02:43,938 --> 01:02:49,089
And you left...
Chris and Sally alone with her?

669
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:04,212
I don't think I should drive.
Can you drive? No?

670
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:06,157
Let's see if there's a taxi.

671
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:09,366
Taxi!

672
01:03:14,735 --> 01:03:16,815
There you go.

673
01:03:32,273 --> 01:03:34,665
Get off me, Maggie!

674
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:03,328
No! No! No, no, no!

675
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:37,924
- You okay? Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

676
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:40,795
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

677
01:06:40,895 --> 01:06:42,397
Oh, my God.

678
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:45,009
- Dan, what are you doing?
- Stay in the car. Stay in the car.

679
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:47,302
Dan, be careful!

680
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:49,293
Dan!

681
01:07:38,586 --> 01:07:41,714
Fuck. Fuck.

682
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,784
Sal?

683
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,182
Sally?

684
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:19,752
Maggie?

685
01:08:48,222 --> 01:08:50,109
Maggie.

686
01:08:51,809 --> 01:08:53,707
Maggie.

687
01:08:58,299 --> 01:08:59,744
Maggie.

688
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:20,680
Wake up! Maggie.

689
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:30,765
I told you what would happen
if you misbehaved.

690
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,135
Where's my sister.

691
01:09:34,235 --> 01:09:38,601
I have her, but she's not the one I want.
Where is my little cubbie?

692
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:42,350
He's not your cubbie!

693
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:45,480
He's not your fucking cubbie!

694
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,791
He's my brother!

695
01:09:53,504 --> 01:09:56,853
Do you want your sister
to end up like your friend?

696
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,796
Backyard. Five minutes.

697
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:04,500
I'll trade you Sally for Christopher.

698
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:15,410
Is he dead?

699
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:18,646
- He died on impact.
- Oh, my God.

700
01:10:18,746 --> 01:10:21,516
- You know who he was?
- We still don't know.

701
01:10:22,116 --> 01:10:25,711
The vehicle was reported stolen
and he didn't have any ID on him.

702
01:10:30,691 --> 01:10:33,161
Oh, my... Oh, God.

703
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:34,929
He was alone.

704
01:10:35,029 --> 01:10:38,418
Thank God. I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.

705
01:10:38,518 --> 01:10:41,402
Officer? Do you know how much longer
you need us here?

706
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:46,149
We... our kids are at home and we told
the babysitter we'd be back 15 minutes ago.

707
01:10:46,295 --> 01:10:47,909
Can we...

708
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:50,758
- Okay, let's get you guys outta here.
- Thanks.

709
01:10:50,858 --> 01:10:52,659
Thank you.

710
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:16,365
Jacob?

711
01:11:20,374 --> 01:11:22,375
Jacob!

712
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:36,925
Christopher?

713
01:12:14,762 --> 01:12:17,171
Dan, something is wrong.

714
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:22,203
Something is wrong. She's not picking up
and our machine's not picking up.

715
01:12:22,303 --> 01:12:24,637
I'm sure she just fell asleep.

716
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,666
Yo!

717
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:43,191
I don't... I just have our home number
I don't her cell number.

718
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:46,461
- <i>Car 82110?</i>
- Go ahead.

719
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:50,463
- <i>Report back to Pearl and Court.</i>
- The accident site?

720
01:12:50,563 --> 01:12:53,367
<i>Affirmative. The body of a young girl
was found in the trunk.</i>

721
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:54,753
Jesus Christ, did you hear that?

722
01:12:54,853 --> 01:12:58,506
<i>ID says victim's name
is Anna Coleman of Amherst.</i>

723
01:12:58,606 --> 01:13:01,677
<i>We're sending a cruiser
to her family home now.</i>

724
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:06,413
- That's... that can't be. That's our sitter?
- Anna Coleman is our sitter?

725
01:13:07,048 --> 01:13:10,159
I'm sorry, can you please hit the gas.
Hit the lights. It's an emergency.

726
01:13:10,259 --> 01:13:12,777
We need to get home. Go, go, go!

727
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:06,073
Jacob, get out of the car!

728
01:14:06,173 --> 01:14:07,548
Jacob!

729
01:14:14,415 --> 01:14:16,174
Jacob!

730
01:14:47,147 --> 01:14:49,983
This is it, we're pulling
onto our street right now.

731
01:14:52,687 --> 01:14:55,691
Goddamn it! Can we go faster, please, sir?

732
01:14:56,891 --> 01:15:01,169
There's a car. There's a car.
Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

733
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:11,038
Sally!

734
01:15:11,138 --> 01:15:12,940
Christopher?

735
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,401
Sally? Sally?

736
01:15:17,244 --> 01:15:19,114
Sally?

737
01:15:19,914 --> 01:15:21,738
Dan.
