1
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:25,328
You ready?

2
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:54,159
- How am I doing?
- Sure you want to know?

3
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,762
"Does your boyfriend
always get his way?"

4
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:59,264
Yes.

5
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:02,467
"Does he admit when he's wrong?"

6
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,636
Never.

7
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:07,055
Does your boyfriend know
how to build a fire with no matches?

8
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:09,507
Answer is D, who cares.

9
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:13,278
- A, yes. Very well.
- Sorry, that question's not on here.

10
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,446
- It should be in there.
- Sorry. So you're still zero.

11
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:41,071
- No!
- Yeah!

12
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:46,669
<i>Never put your hat on the bed, son
Never put your hat on the bed</i>

13
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,101
<i>Cuz if your hat's on the bed
You might wake up dead</i>

14
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:52,031
<i>So don't you never put your hat
on the bed</i>

15
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:56,637
<i>Always keep an edge on your knife, son
Always keep an edge on your knife</i>

16
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:59,296
<i>Cuz a good sharp edge
Is a man's best hedge</i>

17
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,715
<i>Against the vague uncertainties of life</i>

18
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,013
<i>Yes, a good sharp edge
Is a man's best hedge</i>

19
00:03:04,113 --> 00:03:05,864
<i>Against the uncertain vagaries of life</i>

20
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:09,033
- Get your hands on the wheel.
- <i>But I never could sharpen no knife</i>

21
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,505
<i>Like the one give the advice</i>

22
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:15,935
<i>Yodel-aye, yodel-aye, yodel-ooh</i>

23
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,763
<i>Never sell the old .22...</i>

24
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,621
- Hello?
- Hey.

25
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,421
- Just give me a second, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

26
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:08,593
- How you doin'?
- Good, good, good.

27
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,462
We're reserved under Louis.

28
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:13,095
- What's the name?
- Alex Louis.

29
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:17,302
Yeah, sign in here. You're ready to go.

30
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:19,904
Your canoe will be
right down there by the water.

31
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,641
- Bring it back Monday at five.
- That's right, back to work Tuesday.

32
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:26,708
- Need a map?
- No, I'm good.

33
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:30,505
- You don't want a map?
- No. No. I know this park well.

34
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,584
It's kinda end of the season, right?

35
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:35,812
I mean, the weather can change on you...
just turn on a dime.

36
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:38,990
- Less people.
- Amen to that.

37
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,811
You mind me askin' you, Mr. No Map,
where you're headed?

38
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,530
Blackfoot Trail.
I can't wait to show her.

39
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,466
It's her first time here.
It's gonna be awesome.

40
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,268
I got some bad news for you,
I'm really sorry about this

41
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,320
but Blackfoot Trail's
closed for the season.

42
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,005
- Why?
- Had to.

43
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:56,435
I mean, so many yahoos, you know,

44
00:04:56,535 --> 00:05:00,611
trampin' around there, disrespecting
everything. This is a treasured site.

45
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:05,016
I don't have to tell you I guess. And Parks
and Recreation want to keep it that way.

46
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:09,254
Look, going to Blackfoot Trail
is kinda the whole point of this trip.

47
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:13,191
It's 500 bucks
if you're caught up there. Each.

48
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,125
That'll be a 1000 bucks
expensive little camping trip.

49
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:19,631
Alright.

50
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:21,706
- Jenn, you ready?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:26,177
Hang on. Hey, rodeo, here's your
medical kit and there's a whistle in there,

52
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:29,341
try to bring that back
and I'll try not to charge you.

53
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,925
Thousand bucks?

54
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:34,276
You're pretty good.

55
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:39,848
- Bye. You have a nice trip.
- Thanks.

56
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,838
- Really?
- Last one.

57
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:03,141
- Come on, babe.
- No, this is really important.

58
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:07,178
You know, we've been waiting
forever for this. I'm... just...

59
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:10,179
They're all important.
Can't wait till we get back?

60
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,094
Okay, I'm done. Okay?

61
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:16,949
- Alright. I don't believe you, but...
- Well, putting it away, so it's...

62
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:20,425
Hang on, hang on. Let's take a picture.
Just to mark the departure.

63
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:24,092
- Put it to good use, right?
- Fine. Okay.

64
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,430
Ready?

65
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,399
- Good.
- Yeah. One of us looks good.

66
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:35,570
Alright.

67
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,878
- Hey, have a good one.
- Thanks a lot.

68
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:31,856
- Fuck!
- You okay?

69
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:35,259
Fuck, fuck that...
fuckin' hurt like a bitch.

70
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,429
You sure you're okay?

71
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,563
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll just walk it off.

72
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,900
This is for you.

73
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:49,892
You look scared anyway. Feel safe.

74
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,607
I probably won't need it.

75
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,858
Got it taken care of already.

76
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,295
- Look what I got.
- When did you get that?

77
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:05,356
- I got it a few days ago.
- You're not gonna need it.

78
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:08,129
Do you wanna have a good time on this trip
or do you want me to be freaking out?

79
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:11,996
- This is what makes me feel safe.
- Okay. Okay.

80
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:16,267
Well, if you can have it, it's useless
in your bag. Give it to me. Thanks.

81
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,936
Just gonna clip it
to your belt, alright?

82
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,570
And you're not gonna need it.

83
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:24,539
Bear spray.

84
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:27,111
Wonder what other goodies
you have in there.

85
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,313
- Nothin'.
- Let's see.

86
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,647
I don't have anything in there.
Hey, there's nothing.

87
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:34,919
- Come on.
- What?

88
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:38,857
- Seriously? This is a road flare.
- I know what it is.

89
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:42,125
Yeah. This is for when your car
breaks down on the side of the highway.

90
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:44,962
You know this. I know you know this.

91
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,298
Jenn, come on, if you wanted a flare,
I could've picked up a pen flare.

92
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:50,231
They sell them at any camping store.

93
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:55,003
- Here's your flare.
- Thank you.

94
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,110
- You ready?
- Think so.

95
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,243
Okay.

96
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:05,596
Oh, my God.

97
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:10,627
- You good?
- Yes.

98
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:38,516
What, sorry, what?

99
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:44,118
Jenn, you know we'd be lucky to see
anything bigger than a chipmunk, right?

100
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:08,510
- Hi.
- Hey.

101
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,368
No!

102
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:41,079
Hey, look at that. That's cute.

103
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,047
We should take it.

104
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:45,680
- Here's a good spot.
- Yeah.

105
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:50,485
Counselor, back up, please.

106
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,409
- Tryin' to turn me on right now?
- Is it working?

107
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:14,776
Oh, yeah. It's pretty hot.

108
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,379
Speaking of...

109
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,670
do you remember the little
swimming hole we walked by?

110
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,088
- Nope, I don't. No.
- Really?

111
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:29,927
- You said you would.
- I didn't say that.

112
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:31,645
- Yes, you did.
- I said maybe.

113
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:35,033
No, no, no. You said yes.
Come on, babes.

114
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:38,469
No. It's like when you say, "Do you
want to order Chinese food tonight?"

115
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:41,706
And I go, "Maybe,"
and then we get Italian.

116
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:43,207
It's like that.

117
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,727
- I'm gonna be all lonely by myself.
- Well, no one's making you do this.

118
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,310
Stop it!

119
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,850
Oh, my God, please. What if there's...

120
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,987
Don't leave me hangin', babe.

121
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:03,791
Okay, okay. Fine.

122
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,376
- You ready?
- No.

123
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,528
Come on.

124
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:29,919
5... 4... 3, 2, 1!

125
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:38,668
- Jenn, come on!
- No!

126
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,764
It's freezing.

127
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,344
I'm gonna get some more wood
before it gets too dark.

128
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:57,114
- Okay, I'll come help you.
- No, no, I'll be back in a second.

129
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:59,647
Okay. Yeah.

130
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,619
Hello.

131
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:06,672
How long have you been...

132
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,983
At this time...

133
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:12,320
- What?
- No, I mean...

134
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,356
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:38,282
Hey. This is Alex. Alex this is Brad.

136
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:40,584
- Brad, right?
- Yeah. Hi, how are you?

137
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:43,050
I'm good. Thanks.

138
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:46,489
- Were you just walkin' by or...
- Oh, yeah, I was comin' up the trail

139
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:49,260
and I ran into your friend here
and she invited me over for a chat.

140
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,397
Yeah. Turns out that he also
kind of grew up in a park, the woods.

141
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:57,118
And he's got a ton of fish so I thought
maybe we could all have dinner tonight.

142
00:15:57,218 --> 00:16:01,272
Couldn't eat 'em all if I wanted to.
I mean, I could try, but...

143
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,274
I just gotta put a shirt on, alright?

144
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:05,773
- Okay.
- Yeah.

145
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:08,843
So you were sayin'...

146
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,854
- Jenn?
- Yeah?

147
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:20,554
- Would you come help me here for a sec?
- Sure.

148
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:25,596
- What's up?
- Come on in.

149
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,762
Okay.

150
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:32,903
- What's goin' on?
- You comfortable with this?

151
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:36,941
- What? Him?
- Yeah, I don't know, this guy could be...

152
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,443
I was talkin' to him for, like,
10 minutes. He's great.

153
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,926
- He's great. Well, he's a liar.
- Why is he a liar?

154
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,410
Woods? What, the woods of Ireland?

155
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,296
- Come on, come on.
- What does that have to do with anything?

156
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:51,559
Did you invite him
or he invited himself?

157
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:53,654
I did.

158
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:58,364
- You want me to uninvite him?
- No, we can't do that.

159
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:02,562
- I can do that. It'd be really awkward.
- You'd never be able to do that. I know you.

160
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:06,370
- What do you need help with?
- I obviously don't need help.

161
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,027
I guess it wasn't obvious because...
you told me to come in here.

162
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,712
You know, I don't wanna
bother you all, so...

163
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:17,581
Probably better if I just be
on my way and... have a nice trip.

164
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:20,684
- No, no, no. Stay.
- No, no, no. You're gonna stay...

165
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:22,986
and you're gonna have
some dinner with us.

166
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,255
- Yeah?
- Of course.

167
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:27,722
It was just... it was just
a misunderstanding, that's all.

168
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:31,786
Well, alright, then. Let's do it.

169
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:53,365
You wanted fish.

170
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:02,651
I thought it was illegal
to fish these lakes.

171
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:06,630
Grandfather law.

172
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,568
So that's when... like an old law
applies to existing situations

173
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:12,703
but then a new one
applies to all the future ones?

174
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:16,874
- I know what a grandfather law is.
- Okay. Sorry.

175
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:20,183
- Lawyer.
- Yeah, I got that.

176
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:26,048
What about you, Alex? What do you do?

177
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,020
Well... right now I'm...

178
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,792
My buddy has a landscaping business
so I'm... I'm working with him.

179
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:37,192
Are you Mexican?

180
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,130
I didn't mean anything by that.

181
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,733
I just thought that's a job
that the Mexicans do here.

182
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,802
Well, what he does is pretty high end.

183
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:48,005
And actually he's starting
a new company soon, so...

184
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:50,574
It's great. He's really talented.

185
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:53,350
Well done you, Alex.

186
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:00,718
- Trout looks good.
- It does, right?

187
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:05,656
Yeah, and lucky for me if I cannot find
any fish I got a license to kill a deer.

188
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:06,736
Oh, cool.

189
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:10,494
Fuck me tryin' to get a license
for that these days.

190
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:13,030
You guys have anything
we can cook for sides with these?

191
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,313
Yeah, you know, I could...

192
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,916
- Maybe fry the veggies or potatoes?
- Yeah, veggies sound good.

193
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:21,539
- Okay.
- Well, I say the potatoes.

194
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,041
Why don't we do both?

195
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:26,377
You know, Alex...

196
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:29,054
let's eat the potatoes.

197
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,305
I'll get 'em.

198
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,761
So you're Irish?

199
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:47,598
- County Tipperary.
- Is that near Mexico?

200
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:51,268
That's a good one.
Actually south of Dublin.

201
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,971
What do you do for a livin' out here?

202
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:58,008
I give backcountry Eco tours
to tourists that want...

203
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:00,179
you know, like a deeper experience
of the wilderness you know,

204
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,626
somethin' more than campin'
in a parking lot.

205
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:04,932
Yeah? That's cool.

206
00:20:05,032 --> 00:20:08,753
I mean, you and Jenn are doin' it
so it must be cool, right?

207
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:11,198
How much would somethin' like that cost?

208
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:15,489
I wouldn't know.

209
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:18,518
You don't know how much it costs?

210
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,365
I only know how much they pay me, Alex.

211
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:34,953
Okay, so they're already parboiled, we just
need to put 'em on for a few minutes.

212
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:37,405
Hang on.

213
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,102
Oh, my...

214
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:52,863
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:59,190
Alright, then.
Let's see what we've got here.

216
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:03,570
- I can do that.
- No, I got it.

217
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,976
This smells delicious.

218
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:10,448
Yeah. There's, garlic, rosemary
and there's some thyme.

219
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:14,584
- You're a luck man, Alex.
- I know.

220
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:16,820
So what are your plans?

221
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,990
You guys gonna do some amazing hikes,
see some spots, what?

222
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:23,427
- I think we can...
- You know, we live really hectic lives

223
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:27,398
so I think we're just gonna... relax.
Stay around here for a few days.

224
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:30,401
- Yep.
- Alright.

225
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:33,735
You're really grabbin' life
by the balls, Alex, aren't ya?

226
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,193
I'm just sayin'.

227
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:40,578
You know, if... if I had a beautiful
woman here like Jenn, I'd...

228
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:45,182
wanna take her to some spots that
weren't on the... the tourist trail, right?

229
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,117
As a matter of fact, Jenn...

230
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:52,256
there is this absolutely gorgeous
waterfall, I mean, really beautiful.

231
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:55,326
- You've probably been there, right, Alex?
- Yeah, totally.

232
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:59,663
Then you know which side
of the waterfall to climb down on.

233
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,577
The right side.

234
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,024
Right side.

235
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:11,101
- Good guess, Alex.
- I wasn't guessing.

236
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,911
You see these tourists are always
tryin' to go down the left side.

237
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:16,780
I mean, they think it's safer.
Fuckin' idiots!

238
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,916
There's also a...

239
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,418
it's frozen... frozen arrow.

240
00:22:21,518 --> 00:22:23,987
In Blackfoot Trail.

241
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,157
I mean, if it were me...

242
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:29,860
I'd want to take you to all those spots.

243
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,629
You sure you don't need a guide?

244
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:35,312
I already have one.

245
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,755
Let's eat.

246
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,581
Alright.

247
00:22:57,888 --> 00:23:01,393
- That was fun.
- Yeah, thanks for the fish.

248
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,364
Alright.

249
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:10,133
Well, now, I'm ready. Cheers.

250
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,502
Goodnight.

251
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:15,037
Say, Alex...

252
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:17,474
you know, earlier...

253
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:19,743
you said something.

254
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,287
It was a misunderstanding.

255
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:25,848
You wanna explain that to me?

256
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,885
- It was nothing.
- Come on, he's a big boy.

257
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:31,154
Let him answer.

258
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:34,024
It's just a funny thing to say.

259
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:35,692
What'd you mean by it?

260
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:37,961
I'm not sure I understand
what you're getting at.

261
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:40,728
Oh, yes, you do.

262
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:45,482
What... was the misunderstanding?

263
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:54,144
Is it important?

264
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:56,146
I won't be fuckin' askin' if it wasn't.

265
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:58,713
- It's on me, okay. I was just...
- Jenn.

266
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:07,057
Well, I come back here...

267
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:10,382
and I find my girlfriend
talkin' to this guy...

268
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:13,699
and I'm not sure it's a good idea.

269
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:18,702
That's all.

270
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:21,467
I mean, I don't know you.

271
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:25,066
So what was the misunderstanding?

272
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:31,482
You can be some nut.

273
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:35,165
She convinced me otherwise.

274
00:24:38,954 --> 00:24:41,715
Like I said, Alex...

275
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:47,674
you're a lucky guy.

276
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,736
I'm sorry.

277
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,941
Jenn, I...

278
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:57,954
- I think you dropped something.
- I got it.

279
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:02,676
Thanks.

280
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,992
Why don't you invite him to the house
next time. That'd be fun.

281
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:18,676
I said I'm sorry.

282
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:22,399
- Should we worry about him?
- What's that?

283
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:26,403
Should we worry about him
comin' back, or I don't know...

284
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:29,870
No, he's just... he's just weird.

285
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,394
But I'm bringing my axe.
And I'm gonna sleep with it

286
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:40,216
in case your fuckin' dinner guest wants
to come back for... dessert or something.

287
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:42,749
You're mad.

288
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,824
- Jenn, I don't understand you.
- What?

289
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:52,129
You invite a total stranger to eat dinner
with us our first night on this trip.

290
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:55,999
Okay, I... I didn't know what to do.

291
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,342
I was just being kind.

292
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,072
I'm sorry.

293
00:26:02,472 --> 00:26:06,475
Just stay here. If he turns around
and comes back, you yell for me.

294
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:47,584
Oh, my God.

295
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:50,256
That smells amazing.

296
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:54,972
Thank you.

297
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,930
Remember the survey that we took
on the way over here?

298
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,535
The first question was about...

299
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:04,434
how many times your boyfriend
has made breakfast in bed for you?

300
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:05,735
- Remember that?
- Really?

301
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah, and I had to write zero. I guess
I'll have to change that from zero to one.

302
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,441
One?

303
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:14,011
- Was it really zero?
- Yeah.

304
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,846
- You embarrassed?
- Little bit.

305
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:19,213
- This isn't even in bed...
- Believe me this counts.

306
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,400
Thank you.

307
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:29,192
What is it about this place
that's so amazing?

308
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:33,129
- Blackfoot Trail?
- Yeah. Why's it called that anyway?

309
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:35,298
The local tribes called it that
because when the trail ends

310
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:40,036
it circles around this really small lake.
And the earth around the lake is black.

311
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:42,514
So when they hunted they followed
animal tracks in the black earth

312
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:44,541
and called it Blackfoot Trail.

313
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:47,610
So what's the lake called?

314
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,046
- I don't know.
- Seriously?

315
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:52,683
No, no, no, picture it,
picture it, picture it, alright?

316
00:27:52,783 --> 00:27:54,985
You come up this steep rocky trail

317
00:27:55,085 --> 00:28:00,390
and then all of a sudden it levels off
and it's this beautiful, pristine lake.

318
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,795
When I was a kid this was my favorite
place in the whole world.

319
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:07,097
Now it looks so out of place
that high up.

320
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:10,500
It's like out of some fantasy novel
or something, you know.

321
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,903
Yeah, I have a feeling your geeky side
is about to come out.

322
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:14,705
- What geeky side?
- What geeky side?

323
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:17,007
The one that made me watch
"Legend" four times.

324
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:19,176
"Just wait for the part where Tom Cruise
is waiting by the lake

325
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:20,544
for the big white unicorn to come out."

326
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,445
It's an awesome scene.
What are you talking about?

327
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:25,290
Yeah, indeed.

328
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,824
All good?

329
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,421
Yeah.

330
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:53,710
Of course, you're going that way.

331
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,043
This is the way.

332
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:50,637
Fuck.

333
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,996
Fuck.

334
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,320
Let me see it.

335
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,633
Alex, it's disgusting.

336
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:04,797
It's pretty bad.

337
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:25,215
- Oh, fuck!
- Are you ready?

338
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:30,981
Sorry.

339
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:34,204
That's not good.

340
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:39,106
- To think you're laughing about it.
- Oh, why not?

341
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:45,748
Just don't touch the toe. Don't touch...
Here, let me... let me finish it.

342
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:48,486
- It looks... it looks okay.
- It looks terrible.

343
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:53,887
- What you got there?
- You could use some new socks.

344
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:58,258
- Stupid place.
- Oh, thanks, babes.

345
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:00,593
Okay.

346
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,487
Alex.

347
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:02,789
Alex.

348
00:33:12,268 --> 00:33:15,370
Alex. Alex.

349
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,575
Alex, get up. Listen.

350
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:20,810
- What?
- Just listen. What is that?

351
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,009
What?

352
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:27,383
- Someone's throwing shit at our tent.
- What?

353
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:29,886
Just listen.

354
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:32,889
- What is that?
- That?

355
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:34,624
Oh, that's acorns.

356
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:39,493
Just fallin' from the trees on our tent.
It's fine. Just go back to sleep.

357
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:54,001
That's not an acorn.

358
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,148
What is it?

359
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:04,039
- Do you think it's him?
- Let's just listen for a bit, okay?

360
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:20,570
Fuck! I swear,
now you got me all paranoid.

361
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,139
Maybe he came back. He's throwing stones
at the tent or something stupid.

362
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,982
No, no, no, it could be anything.

363
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:33,813
Whatever it is, it stopped.

364
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:38,758
So, let's just go back to sleep,
okay? It's fine.

365
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:41,121
It stopped.

366
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:38,247
That wasn't there last night, was it?

367
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:40,050
No.

368
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,985
I wanna go home.
I don't wanna be here anymore.

369
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:47,337
- Jenn, come on, don't overreact, okay?
- An acorn did that?

370
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:52,428
Come on, I've waited
so long for this trip.

371
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:56,119
We're here and when you get there,

372
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:58,462
you'll love it.

373
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:02,090
I promise.

374
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:05,441
Yeah, okay.

375
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,878
- Can you do this for me?
- Yes.

376
00:36:08,578 --> 00:36:11,613
- Thank you.
- Alright.

377
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:20,323
She's a very good artist. I have no idea
why you don't give her a chance.

378
00:36:20,423 --> 00:36:22,625
- What do you mean?
- And she's a great performer.

379
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,761
You know, it's just not my thing.

380
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:26,996
- I don't...
- Oh, hey.

381
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:29,389
Hang on a second.

382
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,032
What?

383
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:41,729
This is wintergreen.

384
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:44,781
And you can eat this.

385
00:36:47,948 --> 00:36:49,485
Tastes like spearmint gum.

386
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:50,420
- You want some?
- No.

387
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,853
- You sure?
- Yes. An animal probably peed on it.

388
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,556
Your loss.

389
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:01,094
What's that smell?

390
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:14,607
It's nothin'.

391
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:24,755
Babe.

392
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:45,243
Oh, my God. Alex!

393
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,143
I mean, what...

394
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:00,086
No.

395
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:41,394
Oh, God. Get off me.

396
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:47,800
Oh, my God.

397
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:51,307
I found it!

398
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:53,673
Thank God!

399
00:39:07,422 --> 00:39:10,121
What is so funny?

400
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,995
Looks like you have a little piece
of poo on your face.

401
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:17,119
- Yeah, 'cause I just fell down on it.
- You fell? You okay?

402
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:19,902
I'm fine. Shouldn't we be
saving that or something?

403
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:23,903
No, we've got plenty of water
at the lake. I brought the drops.

404
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:26,071
Here.

405
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:31,347
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

406
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,883
- This is it?
- Yeah, just up there.

407
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:36,319
It's a real bitch to get up, isn't it?

408
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:39,822
I know. But it's worth it.

409
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,657
- Alright.
- Come on!

410
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:44,784
- I'm comin'.
- Come on!

411
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:55,304
Come on!

412
00:40:23,198 --> 00:40:25,164
Alex...

413
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:36,412
Where's the lake?

414
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:38,680
I can't believe this.

415
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,934
- Alex... This can't be it, right?
- I don't... I don't understand.

416
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:45,154
Fuck! I was sure. I was, like,
a fucking 100% sure. I was...

417
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:47,391
- Can you look at me, please?
- Just let me think. Just let me think.

418
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:49,230
Let me think. Let me think.

419
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:54,594
Fuck! God damn it!
What the fuck is this?

420
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,503
Please tell me you have
a map in your bag.

421
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:03,539
- I never needed a map.
- Oh, we do now.

422
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,174
I don't have one.

423
00:41:06,574 --> 00:41:09,111
- So, then, where are we?
- I obviously don't know, right?

424
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:12,315
But you said that you've done this,
like, so many times...

425
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:14,684
You said it was, like,
a few years ago you did this.

426
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:16,686
Yeah, I've been to the park
a bunch of times!

427
00:41:16,786 --> 00:41:19,755
The trail, Alex.
You said you did the trail.

428
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:21,890
Yeah.

429
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,624
Not since high school, but...

430
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:38,139
- It's not...
- I put it here. I...

431
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,077
I put it right here.

432
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,586
It's not...

433
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,821
- I took it out.
- What?

434
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:55,891
Your phone. I took it out.

435
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:58,260
Where is it?

436
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,896
- In the car.
- Why would you do that?

437
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:05,334
I didn't want you on that thing
the whole time when we're here.

438
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:09,639
I didn't reach for that once. I wanted
to bring it in case we needed it.

439
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:12,108
Which we do.

440
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:16,309
- You can't get reception out here anyway...
- Well, I would have loved to try.

441
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:32,628
When was the last time
you were sure of where you were?

442
00:42:32,728 --> 00:42:37,265
- I was sure the whole time.
- No. Think, Alex.

443
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:39,732
When was it?

444
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:43,138
I don't...

445
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:47,534
- Maybe the fork in the trail
- The first one, the second one?

446
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:55,448
First one.

447
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,721
- Are you serious?
- Just... come on, don't freak out.

448
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:00,623
I don't want to be
freaking out right now.

449
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:03,793
But we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

450
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:07,146
We don't have anything. We don't have
a map. We don't have a cell phone.

451
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:10,599
We don't have anything.
We haven't seen anyone in so long!

452
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:12,601
- This is... it's okay.
- Why...

453
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:15,738
Why did we have to come so far
on my first camping trip?

454
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:17,673
Why couldn't it just have been
a regular trip?

455
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:20,276
- Why do you always have to show off?
- I'm not showing off...

456
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:22,837
- Why do you always try to impress me?
- I'm not trying to impress you.

457
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:24,413
'Cause I'm not fucking impressed
right now!

458
00:43:24,513 --> 00:43:26,482
Good!

459
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:30,019
- I'm not trying to fucking impress you!
- Alex, could we be honest for a second?

460
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,385
I'd love to be honest for once.

461
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:37,893
I wish I never came.
This whole thing was a mistake.

462
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:41,030
- Come on, Jenn, don't...
- And we should be going home tomorrow.

463
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,098
But you fucked it up.

464
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:46,832
You always fuck it all up.
You're such a fucking loser.

465
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:53,442
The stupid lake!
Why did we have to come here?

466
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,893
I don't even care why.

467
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:02,184
Why?

468
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:06,085
I was gonna propose to you.

469
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,257
God!

470
00:45:09,217 --> 00:45:11,750
I'm really sorry.

471
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,824
I had no idea.

472
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,705
It's okay.

473
00:45:31,707 --> 00:45:34,506
We should probably make camp.

474
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:37,073
We're going tomorrow.

475
00:45:37,173 --> 00:45:39,081
- Okay.
- Okay.

476
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:41,413
Sounds good.

477
00:48:30,351 --> 00:48:33,054
- Was that a...
- No, no, no, no. It was a raccoon.

478
00:48:33,154 --> 00:48:37,122
- You can tell me the truth.
- No, I saw the little shit last night.

479
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:45,497
Shit.

480
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:55,514
- Is this right?
- Yeah.

481
00:48:55,614 --> 00:48:58,552
We just need to take a
turn at that overgrown trail.

482
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:02,915
- Didn't seem this far down.
- No, we're good. We're good.

483
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:06,919
Watch your step. Watch your step there.

484
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:31,462
- Sh... shit.
- Should we go back?

485
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:35,919
I don't know.

486
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:38,956
What are the chances this
leading to something?

487
00:49:40,956 --> 00:49:45,024
Pretty good. Right, it's provincial park.
It's gotta lead somewhere.

488
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,200
Here.

489
00:50:29,804 --> 00:50:31,874
Thank you.

490
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:38,951
What is that?

491
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,594
Bear bed.

492
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:53,959
Okay.

493
00:50:55,063 --> 00:50:56,965
Okay.

494
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:59,668
Let's go as far as we can before dark.

495
00:50:59,968 --> 00:51:02,037
Right?

496
00:51:02,537 --> 00:51:04,573
Come on.

497
00:51:05,073 --> 00:51:07,239
Let's go, Alex.

498
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:32,497
I'm so sorry.

499
00:51:38,038 --> 00:51:40,971
Did you mean those things you said?

500
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:44,176
No, I didn't.

501
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:47,899
'Cause, Jenn, I mean,
if that's what you feel abo...

502
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:50,016
No.

503
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:56,491
I should have never said that.

504
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,069
I was just really mad.

505
00:52:00,194 --> 00:52:02,456
I'm sorry.

506
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:06,908
I love you.

507
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:13,338
Do you wanna see it?

508
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:15,810
The ring?

509
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,787
Yeah.

510
00:52:19,246 --> 00:52:21,031
If you want to.

511
00:52:35,363 --> 00:52:39,149
No, no, no, no, don't.
No. Actually, just...

512
00:52:40,468 --> 00:52:42,479
wait.

513
00:52:46,607 --> 00:52:48,540
Okay.

514
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,877
So hungry.

515
00:52:59,954 --> 00:53:05,257
I think I... I think I have
half a protein bar left in here.

516
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:10,432
And this is all we have? This is it?

517
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:12,598
Yeah.

518
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,603
Oh, wait a second.

519
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:17,004
Except for...

520
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:25,478
Ta-da.

521
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,781
Come on.

522
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:30,552
- Really?
- Yeah.

523
00:53:30,652 --> 00:53:33,190
- You want some?
- Yeah.

524
00:53:36,323 --> 00:53:38,457
Straight top.

525
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:43,765
You first.

526
00:53:43,865 --> 00:53:45,890
Okay.

527
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:49,601
To us.

528
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,271
To us.

529
00:53:56,375 --> 00:54:01,179
That is so good. Have some. It's great.

530
00:54:04,852 --> 00:54:07,185
That is good.

531
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:15,094
I know this sucks.

532
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,966
Could be worse.

533
00:54:18,066 --> 00:54:20,335
How is that?

534
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:23,401
At least we're together.

535
00:54:28,576 --> 00:54:30,875
I mean it.

536
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:39,718
Come here.

537
00:55:17,858 --> 00:55:20,027
What is that, Alex?

538
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:22,291
I don't know.

539
00:55:30,604 --> 00:55:33,439
Alex, do you think it's a bear?

540
00:55:35,209 --> 00:55:37,506
Hey!

541
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:54,329
- Is it gone?
- Let's get back in the tent.

542
00:55:54,429 --> 00:55:55,962
Okay.

543
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:59,584
Okay. Let's go.

544
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:23,124
It's okay.

545
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:26,284
We scared it off. We're good.

546
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:29,294
Okay? We're good.

547
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:07,137
- Hi.
- Hi.

548
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:09,571
So, I was thinking...

549
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:14,209
that I should phone down in the front desk
and order us some room service.

550
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:16,275
Maybe a couples massage?

551
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:24,149
Deep tissues.

552
00:57:28,555 --> 00:57:31,224
We're gonna be okay.

553
00:57:32,426 --> 00:57:34,595
I know.

554
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:44,502
We should get going, okay?

555
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:03,005
What? Alex.

556
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:07,162
- What?
- Stay quiet.

557
00:58:07,262 --> 00:58:11,333
- You're scaring me. What?
- Stay quiet. Stay quiet.

558
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,432
Did he come back?

559
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:22,120
What the fuck is he doing?

560
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:25,464
What the fuck is he doing?

561
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:35,117
- Did it come back? Is it outside?
- Yeah.

562
00:58:41,495 --> 00:58:43,858
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.

563
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,768
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.

564
00:58:46,868 --> 00:58:48,837
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.

565
00:58:48,937 --> 00:58:51,221
Please move on.

566
00:59:02,116 --> 00:59:03,485
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

567
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:07,122
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Is it out there? Did it come back?

568
00:59:07,222 --> 00:59:08,557
What do we do?
We don't even have food in here.

569
00:59:08,657 --> 00:59:10,888
I know. Where's my axe?

570
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,966
- What the fuck! Where's my axe?
- You put in your bag?

571
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:21,533
I left my bag by the fire.

572
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:26,474
I cannot believe this is happening.
What do we do?

573
00:59:26,574 --> 00:59:29,912
What do we do?
We don't even have food in here.

574
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:33,478
Alex.

575
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,703
Alex!

576
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:38,548
Get behind me! Get behind me!

577
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:42,751
Get the fuck out!

578
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,686
Get the fuck out! Just get out!

579
01:00:56,196 --> 01:00:58,263
Spray it!

580
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,746
I'm gonna wrap it. I know, just...

581
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:19,888
Okay. Okay, okay.

582
01:01:19,988 --> 01:01:21,741
It's okay. It's okay.

583
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:24,923
I'm gonna wrap it.

584
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:33,336
- It's okay.
- Jenn. Jenn, I can't feel my foot.

585
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:39,741
It's okay. It's okay.

586
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:41,638
- I can't feel my foot.
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

587
01:01:41,738 --> 01:01:44,145
We're gonna crawl out of here
if we have to. You hear me?

588
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:47,052
- My God! I'm gonna fucking die out here!
- No, you're not!

589
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:50,618
- I'm gonna fucking die!
- Alex! You're fine!

590
01:01:50,718 --> 01:01:53,942
Alex, you're gonna be fine.

591
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:11,102
- No!
- Alex!

592
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,330
Run, Jenn! Run!

593
01:05:25,015 --> 01:05:26,639
Help!

594
01:05:28,268 --> 01:05:30,890
Help!

595
01:05:31,871 --> 01:05:35,347
Help! Anybody!

596
01:10:06,446 --> 01:10:10,138
Help! Help!

597
01:14:22,468 --> 01:14:24,535
Fuck!

598
01:15:11,317 --> 01:15:13,350
Fuck!
