1
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,376
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

2
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,417
<i>911, what's your emergency?
Are you there?</i>

3
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,020
<i> There...</i>
<i>There are people here.</i>

4
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,650
<i>Okay, calm down. Where are you?
What's your address?</i>

5
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,728
<i>I don't know.</i>

6
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,818
<i>Are you in danger?</i>

7
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,693
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

8
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,766
<i>What's your name?</i>

9
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,061
<i>Jordan.</i>

10
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,093
<i>We need help.</i>

11
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,604
<i>Okay. Can you tell me</i>
<i>what street you're on?</i>

12
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,675
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>where we are.</i>

13
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,675
<i>Jordan, who</i>
<i>are you with?</i>

14
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,803
<i>We went into the house.</i>
<i>We found people.</i>

15
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,780
<i>You found who, Jordan?</i>
<i>Who did you find?</i>

16
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,116
<i>There's blood</i>
<i>on the walls.</i>

17
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,812
<i>Help us! Help us!</i>

18
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,184
<i>Jordan. Jordan, calm down.</i>

19
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,149
<i>It's everywhere.</i>

20
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,920
<i>Jordan, what happened?</i>

21
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,959
<i>There's blood</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

22
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,121
When did you do all this?

23
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,850
Today. With Mike.

24
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,326
When you were with the girls.
I thought you'd like it.

25
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,146
You can have this room.
I'm gonna get set up out there.

26
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,820
Yeah, I don't know
about the tub.

27
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,024
Didn't know if the roses
go in first or after.

28
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,029
Yeah, I don't
know either.

29
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,847
Here.

30
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,179
Let me.

31
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,415
Thank you.
Okay.

32
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,740
Mike, it's me.
We're at the house now.

33
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:56,447
I... I know you're fucking drunk,
maybe you're asleep now, but...

34
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,845
Uh...

35
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,010
I'll tell you when
I see you, but things...

36
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,053
They didn't work out
the way I planned at all.

37
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,247
Um...

38
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,054
I'm going to need you to
come out here and get me.

39
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,030
Just whenever you wake up in the morning.
I'm going to give her the car.

40
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,793
Just call me when
you get this, okay?

41
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,734
I know it's a bitch to
come all the way out here

42
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,705
but, sorry,
this sucks. Okay.

43
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,699
Hi.

44
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,798
Hi.

45
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,629
Come outside
with me.

46
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,868
I only wanted
to dance with you.

47
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,132
We're dancing
right now.

48
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,229
Jerk.

49
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,172
You're a jerk.
You're a jerk.

50
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,180
Oh, it's freezing.
Let's get in the car.

51
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,149
Wait a second.

52
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,987
What?

53
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,986
I just want to
tell you something.

54
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,058
What do you
wanna tell me?

55
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,504
I remember the first
time I ever saw you.

56
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,713
It's really nice,
everything you did.

57
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,283
It's beautiful.

58
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,646
Yeah.

59
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,723
Here.

60
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,791
I can't keep it.
I can't take it back.

61
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,926
Please.

62
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,906
Just take it, please.

63
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,288
Here.

64
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,600
Your clothes are in the
bedroom, if you want.

65
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,311
I wanna wear this.

66
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,814
You know, I only get to wear it tonight.
It makes me feel pretty.

67
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,015
You are pretty.

68
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,229
I'm so sorry it wasn't the
way you thought it would be.

69
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,399
I'm really sorry.

70
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,929
Well, what do we do now?

71
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,197
I don't know.

72
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,202
I'm just not
ready yet.

73
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,107
Okay.

74
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,058
James, please...
Please.

75
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,255
Talk to me.

76
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,388
Christ.

77
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,367
This is embarrassing.

78
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,132
You are my girl.

79
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,467
What is it, like,
4:00 in the morning?

80
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,660
Hi.

81
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,033
Hello.

82
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,940
Is Tamara here?

83
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,018
No. No, you got
the wrong house.

84
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,454
You sure?

85
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,192
Yeah. I'm sorry.

86
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,567
See you later.

87
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,375
That was weird.

88
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,740
Yeah.

89
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,247
You know, people get lost out here.
Should I go get her?

90
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,580
She seemed okay. I mean,
I think she would've said if she wasn't.

91
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,652
It's cold out there.

92
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,616
I'm out of cigarettes.

93
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,157
I'll go get
you some more.

94
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,326
I didn't mean that.
You don't have to.

95
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,060
I'll just go to sleep.
I'm tired, anyway.

96
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,996
No, you won't.

97
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,071
I'll try.

98
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,338
It's all right, I want to
drive for a while, anyway.

99
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,348
Let me light
you a fire.

100
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,794
I was thinking when
you were taking a bath.

101
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,767
I want you to take
the car back tomorrow.

102
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,364
What do you mean?

103
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,840
I don't think a road trip's
a good idea right now.

104
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,405
I called Mike. He's gonna come
out and get me in the morning.

105
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,512
Are you sure
that's what you want?

106
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,683
Yeah.

107
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,729
Okay, I'll be back.

108
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,862
If you want, we
can talk some more.

109
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,564
We don't have
to. Okay?

110
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,669
You gonna be
okay here?

111
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,766
Yeah, I'll be fine.

112
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,072
Okay.

113
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,544
Thanks for lighting
me a fire.

114
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,705
Sure.

115
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,063
Hello?

116
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,836
Is Tamara home?

117
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,677
You already
came by here.

118
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,146
Are you sure?

119
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,420
Oh, come on.

120
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,655
James, where are you?

121
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,350
That girl came back.

122
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,726
That girl, I mean, she
keeps knocking on the door.

123
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,131
What do you mean?
I heard her voice.

124
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,897
No, I didn't
open the door.

125
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,838
I don't know.

126
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,410
The battery is dead.
I'm charging it right now.

127
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,874
Okay, okay.

128
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,213
I just want you
to come home, okay?

129
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,951
No, I'm fine, but just,
you know, hurry.

130
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,122
How far away are you?

131
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,387
Okay.

132
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,758
Will you just stay
on the phone with me?

133
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,764
James?

134
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,451
James?

135
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,090
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

136
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,646
Go away!

137
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,458
Jamie.
Kristen.

138
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,364
There is someone out there.

139
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,166
What are you doing? What?
There's something...

140
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,900
They'll hear you.
Stop, stop, stop.

141
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,975
Shh!

142
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,304
What happened
to your hand?

143
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,480
Stop. Stop!

144
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,349
Come here, come here. Sit down.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

145
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,477
How do you know there's
somebody out there?

146
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,751
I saw a man at the back door.
He's wearing a mask.

147
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,985
What do you mean?
Like a ski mask? What?

148
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,321
I don't know.
A fucking mask!

149
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,760
I don't know.
Okay, okay. Calm down.

150
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,331
Jamie, I'm so scared.

151
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,524
Okay.

152
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,068
Don't go out there.
Please, don't go.

153
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,869
Please, stop.
Just stay here.

154
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,534
I'm right here. Stop.

155
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,892
No one out here.

156
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,655
Nobody. Come here.

157
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:39,852
Come here.

158
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,524
It's okay, there's nothing here.

159
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,436
So, what do
you wanna do?

160
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,773
I don't know.

161
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,006
Kristen?

162
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,018
Kristen,
what is it?

163
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,182
She's watching us.

164
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,326
She looks like a ghost.

165
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,030
You want me
to go talk to her?

166
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,157
They don't wanna talk.

167
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,461
Well, they want something.

168
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,867
People just don't stand out
there staring at us like that.

169
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,302
They want something.

170
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,536
Shit.
What?

171
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,201
I left my phone in the car,
I'm gonna go get it.

172
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,610
You can't go out there.

173
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,738
Why?

174
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,875
One of them came in
here and took my phone.

175
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,646
Kristen, nobody
came in here.

176
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,256
She's gone.

177
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,473
Fuck!

178
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,397
Shit!

179
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,707
What do you want?

180
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,308
All right, get the
fuck out of here!

181
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,811
James!

182
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,149
Kristen, go back inside.

183
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,618
What's happening?
Kristen...

184
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,617
Kristen, go.

185
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,442
Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?

186
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,279
I'm sorry. I'm waiting for you.

187
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,285
I want you to get your things.
Put your shoes on.

188
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,354
Did you find your phone?

189
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,513
No, I told you,
they took my phone.

190
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,612
Babe, I put it
in your bag.

191
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,055
James, it's not
in the bag.

192
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,626
I plugged it into the wall,
and when I came back it was gone.

193
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,491
It's just, I don't understand.
We checked the whole house,

194
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,325
and nobody in here.

195
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,695
Let me see your hand.

196
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,403
What are you
thinking?

197
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,845
Since we've been here I
haven't heard a dog bark,

198
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,516
a car pass, nothing.

199
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,454
Just us and them.

200
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,353
Why are they
doing this?

201
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,019
Kristen, I don't want you
to think about that, okay?

202
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,031
Don't think about it.
Doesn't matter right now.

203
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,201
We don't need a reason if
they come through that door.

204
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,772
Okay?

205
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,923
What is it?

206
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,291
It's my phone.

207
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,929
We gotta get
out of here.

208
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,312
Shit.

209
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,682
Who is that?

210
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,081
I don't know.

211
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,163
Get out
of the car.

212
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,711
Come on.

213
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,704
James, we
need a gun.

214
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,367
I'm looking.

215
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,004
Does your dad
have a gun?

216
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,769
Kristen,
I'm looking.

217
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,807
There was one here when I was a kid.
He always hid it.

218
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,094
Let's go to
the bedroom.

219
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,197
Oh, my God!

220
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,691
What are you doing?

221
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,957
Looking for bullets.

222
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,033
Stop. I got them,
I got them.

223
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,710
I don't know how
to use this thing.

224
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,082
What do you mean?

225
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,450
I'm not sure I even
know how to load it.

226
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,255
But you said you used
to hunt with your dad.

227
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,287
No, I never did.
It was just something that I said.

228
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,480
When I open the door,
I just want you to run, okay?

229
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,578
Block the door,
block the door.

230
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,559
Push!

231
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,988
Come on.

232
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,846
We're not gonna
fucking die here.

233
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,152
We're gonna sit here, we're gonna wait
for the fucking cops to come, or whatever,

234
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,282
but we're not
gonna fucking die.

235
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:25,388
Yo, Jimmy James.
What's up, buddy?

236
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,458
It's Mike. Listen, man, I'm outside.
I got here early.

237
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,600
I just decided to come out,
and you know,

238
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:35,137
just be here for you as
soon as I possibly could,

239
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,173
because you know how I like to
wait on you hand and fucking foot.

240
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,371
What the fuck?

241
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,186
Hello?

242
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:33,957
Jimmy?

243
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,133
Kristen?

244
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,799
Hello?

245
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,946
Kristen, I shot him.

246
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,623
He didn't have a mask.

247
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,818
What?

248
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,326
Why didn't he have
a fucking mask?

249
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,055
What do you mean,
he didn't have a mask?

250
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,529
James?

251
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,629
James?

252
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,313
What?

253
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,446
Oh, God!

254
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,421
What is it?
Stay there.

255
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,123
James, answer me.

256
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,659
Oh, fuck!

257
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,285
What?

258
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,331
Don't. Stay there.

259
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,662
Get off of me.
Stop it.

260
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,268
It's Mike. Mike.

261
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,700
Please don't look.
It's Mike.

262
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,396
Oh, God.

263
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,489
Baby, it's
not your fault.

264
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,902
He was my best friend.
He's my best friend.

265
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,870
He was my best friend.
What am I gonna do?

266
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,405
Where are you going?

267
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:31,591
I'm gonna go outside.
I want you to hide somewhere.

268
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,855
What are you
talking about?

269
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,955
There's an old radio at the barn,
I'm gonna try and call for help.

270
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,533
I don't know
what else to do.

271
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,100
It's okay, I'm gonna
come right back for you.

272
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,674
Listen, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide there.

273
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,405
I'll keep them away.
I'll come find you.

274
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,537
James, no. I want
to come with you.

275
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,172
Kristen, please, it'll
be okay, I promise.

276
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,248
I'll be fine.

277
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,525
Be careful. James.

278
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,466
Oh, shit!

279
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,725
James?

280
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,054
Ah!

281
00:54:35,555 --> 00:54:37,147
Oh, fuck!

282
00:55:46,893 --> 00:55:48,258
James?

283
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:07,463
Hello?

284
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:08,768
Hello?

285
00:57:28,428 --> 00:57:29,395
Hello?

286
00:57:40,273 --> 00:57:42,104
Can anybody hear me?

287
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,171
<i>This is K-50.</i>

288
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:54,513
<i>Hello?</i>

289
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,878
Can you hear me?
Hello?

290
00:58:58,919 --> 00:59:00,853
Please,
answer me.

291
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,023
Help me.

292
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,286
<i>Where are you?</i>

293
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,999
No!

294
01:06:41,347 --> 01:06:43,042
He's gonna
kill you.

295
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:17,216
Why are you doing this to us?

296
01:07:41,007 --> 01:07:42,133
James!

297
01:07:52,251 --> 01:07:53,513
You're gonna die.

298
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:56,613
Kristen, run!

299
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:28,245
Let me out!

300
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:32,085
Kristen! Run!

301
01:08:43,736 --> 01:08:45,533
Jamie!

302
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,259
Why are you
doing this to us?

303
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,095
Because you
were home.

304
01:11:32,571 --> 01:11:33,799
I love you.

305
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,022
Baby!

306
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:30,391
No! Please! No!

307
01:12:31,797 --> 01:12:33,526
No! Please!

308
01:12:35,234 --> 01:12:37,964
You don't have to do this. Please!

309
01:12:38,304 --> 01:12:42,502
You can stop now.
You... Please! No!

310
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,373
Please, listen to me. Please.

311
01:12:45,544 --> 01:12:48,513
You can stop now.
You don't have to do this.

312
01:12:49,482 --> 01:12:52,144
No!

313
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,188
Baby, look at me.

314
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:09,360
Look at my face.

315
01:13:13,035 --> 01:13:14,400
Don't look,
please.

316
01:13:22,011 --> 01:13:24,809
Please! Please!
Please, don't!

317
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:29,147
No!

318
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,687
<i>No!</i>

319
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,918
Can I have one?

320
01:16:45,697 --> 01:16:47,324
Are you a sinner?

321
01:16:54,139 --> 01:16:55,731
Sometimes.

322
01:17:12,223 --> 01:17:14,007
It'll be
easier next time.
