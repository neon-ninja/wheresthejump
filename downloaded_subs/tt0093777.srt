1
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,348
I found Father Carlton
this morning.

2
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:04,853
He was taken to the hospital,
but he never regained consciousness.

3
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,521
Why was he here?

4
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:10,366
He had an appointment with
His Eminence this afternoon.

5
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:21,156
Let's talk about
our beliefs...

6
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,358
and what we can
learn about them.

7
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:27,095
We believe nature is solid...

8
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:29,397
and time a constant.

9
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:33,501
Matter has substance,
and time a direction.

10
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,605
There is truth in flesh,
huh,

11
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:38,707
and the solid ground.

12
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,876
The wind may be invisible,
but it's real.

13
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:47,248
<i>Smoke, fire, water, light...
They're different,</i>

14
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:52,026
<i>not as to stone nor steel,
but they're tangible.</i>

15
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,457
And we assume time
has an arrow,

16
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:56,902
because it is as a clock.

17
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,761
One second is
one second for everyone.

18
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,776
<i>Cause precedes effect.</i>

19
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:06,534
<i>Fruit rots,
water flows downstream.</i>

20
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,378
<i>We're born, we age, we die.</i>

21
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:11,640
<i>The reverse never happens.</i>

22
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:15,844
None of this is true.
Say good-bye to classical reality,

23
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:19,894
because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level...

24
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:23,429
into ghosts and shadows.

25
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,023
From Job's friends insisting...

26
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:18,293
that the good are rewarded
and the wicked punished...

27
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:20,306
to the scientists of the 1930s...

28
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,597
proving to their horror a theorem...

29
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:25,066
that not everything can be proved,

30
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,436
<i>we've sought to impose
order on the universe.</i>

31
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:32,006
<i>But we have discovered
something very surprising.</i>

32
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:35,643
While order does exist in the universe,

33
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,180
it is not at all what we had in mind.

34
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,516
<i>Professor Birack, in relativity...</i>

35
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:44,497
<i>geometry breaks down on the cosmic
scale, and in quantum physics...</i>

36
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,727
<i>logic breaks down
on the sub-microscopic scale.</i>

37
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:09,953
What's this?
I don't know.

38
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:12,714
Birack did that whole series of
debates on the B.B.C. A few years ago.

39
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,816
Oh, with the English priest.
Right.

40
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:16,955
Maybe they're planning
another one.

41
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:58,092
He died before his appointment
with the Cardinal,

42
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,231
but he left a diary.

43
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:06,078
You-You must help us.

44
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,917
Please.

45
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:41,313
The discovery of this supernova...

46
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:44,317
has immense significance
to the scientific community.

47
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:47,217
Particles collected date
from pre-Cambrian times...

48
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,978
before man walked on earth.

49
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:52,146
<i>Light from the explosion
was hurled through space...</i>

50
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:55,249
<i>at 186,000 miles per second,</i>

51
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:59,993
and is just now reaching us
across the vast expanse of the universe.

52
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,377
He was the guardian priest.

53
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,738
Apparently, he lived here
for over 30 years.

54
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:53,980
Once a week,
he would venture out for food.

55
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:57,512
And every day,

56
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,890
he opened this door.

57
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:26,641
Built in the 1500s...

58
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,843
by arrangement
with the Spanish government.

59
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:33,114
Who knew about this? Only the
members of this forgotten sect.

60
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:35,516
The Brotherhood of Sleep.

61
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:38,853
There was a vow of silence.

62
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:43,391
Even their very existence
was kept from the Holy See.

63
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:46,027
The Vatican didn't know?

64
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:49,130
The guardian priest
would keep the secret,

65
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,179
and before he died
would pass it on to another.

66
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:55,536
The sect had enormous
power and authority.

67
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:58,050
Their actions were never questioned.

68
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,566
Latin.
Some of it is in Latin.

69
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:04,414
<i>Some in Coptic, Greek, numbers.</i>

70
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,451
<i>It's not easy to decipher.</i>

71
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:11,457
The original text has been
distorted over the years.

72
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:13,881
Distorted?
Rewritten.

73
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,983
Writing upon writing,

74
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,419
sometimes two or three times,

75
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,055
and improperly erased.

76
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,797
You can still see
the old writing.

77
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:26,805
It's underneath.

78
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,738
What is it?

79
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:35,313
<i>A secret that can no longer be kept.</i>

80
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,809
Do you feel it?
Yes. Something.

81
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:44,551
It was never here before.

82
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:48,015
It started a month ago.
What started?

83
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:53,601
A change in the earth...
And the sky.

84
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,869
His power.

85
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,871
I don't get it.
What don't you get?

86
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,805
The whole thing.
It doesn't make sense.

87
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:04,775
It violates common sense. That's the whole
point. That's what Einstein couldn't accept.

88
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:09,577
I can't accept it either. Do you know
anything about spontaneous human combustion?

89
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:12,340
Walter, come on. That's
Schrodinger's cat. I know, I know.

90
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:15,710
So what's the point? The point is,
until the cat is observed by someone,

91
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:18,813
he's not in any definite state,
either alive or dead.

92
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,862
He's in a wave superposition state,
both dead and alive at the same time.

93
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,284
Huh?
Okay.

94
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:26,265
Only when we open the box
and observe the cat...

95
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,457
does he materialize into reality,
either dead or alive.

96
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:32,693
But it doesn't make sense. That
is the entire, complete point.

97
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,062
It doesn't make
any common sense.

98
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,531
Our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level.

99
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,767
Why do I want a Ph. D in this?

100
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,746
Particle beam weapons,
research grants.

101
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,647
A millionaire when I'm 40.
Now I remember.

102
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:51,746
<i>You're really gonna like this.
Class canceled?</i>

103
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:54,260
"Will the following students
please see Professor Birack. "

104
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,983
Shit, there I am.
Me too.

105
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:59,220
All of us. And we heard Birack wants
us to cancel our plans for the weekend.

106
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:02,590
What? That's not all. A couple of
biochemistry's finest are coming with us.

107
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,859
And someone to translate Latin.
Coming with us where?

108
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,596
I'm gonna have to pull some strings here. This is just
not gonna happen. I have serious plans for the weekend.

109
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:12,033
4:00, Walter, Birack's office. Oh, I gotta
ditch Pagels again. He's not gonna like it.

110
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:15,048
Sleep with him.
Get an "A."

111
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:18,372
So what about your plans?
I was gonna study, actually.

112
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,808
Me too.
I'm Brian Marsh, by the way,

113
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,910
since we're spending
the weekend together.

114
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:26,480
I know.
Catherine Danforth.

115
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,459
I know.

116
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,219
So where did you
transfer from?

117
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,822
Kneale.
Theoretical physics.

118
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,359
I came here to study with Birack.
You're applied physics, right?

119
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:40,628
So why are you taking
Birack for theory?

120
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,797
I wanna know
what the math means.

121
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,778
Birack's ruthless.
He wants philosophers, not scientists.

122
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:48,969
Well, I've read his books.
He's a brilliant man.

123
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:53,986
Just when I think I've got it,
visualized it, it just all goes away.

124
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:57,712
I start seeing
old-fashioned classical reality again.

125
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,556
I want the clock put back.
I wanna put it all into a little box.

126
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:04,597
But whenever I try,
it just, uh, slithers out.

127
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,431
Some things aren't changed
by quantum physics though.

128
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:12,199
Such as?
Well, for instance,

129
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:16,731
every theoretical physicist
I know wonders why it is...

130
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,133
that no one who looks like you...

131
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:23,877
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building.

132
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:27,851
That's not true, and that's
an extremely sexist thing to say.

133
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:30,491
Confirmed sexist,
and proud of it.

134
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,989
Hey. I was just joking.

135
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,635
What happened?

136
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,769
You talk numbers, you get romantic.

137
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,067
You talk people, you clam up.

138
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:52,974
Just a little miscue, that's all.

139
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,048
It's not your fault.

140
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:59,348
I'm sorry.
I'll see you later.

141
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,352
Hey, wait.

142
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,691
This conversation isn't what I
had in mind. Can we start over?

143
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,155
Okay.
Okay.

144
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,225
I was hoping that you would need
some help with your theory,

145
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,329
and that maybe we could discuss it...

146
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,335
over... over dinner or something.

147
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:26,380
Well, I suppose
something could be arranged.

148
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:32,310
There are other things
that I need help with... over dinner.

149
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,083
I have volunteered our services
to the Archdiocese.

150
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,447
Now, each of you
is a competent physicist,

151
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,223
even though you don't have
a degree to prove it.

152
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,852
Participating in this examination...

153
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,561
will greatly improve your
classroom averages, I might add.

154
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,892
<i>Plan to take your meals there.</i>

155
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,462
<i>We'll bring cots to sleep on.</i>

156
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,376
<i>There are other departments joining us.
Excuse me, sir.</i>

157
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:01,573
Is there some reason why you're not
telling us what we're gonna be doing?

158
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:05,984
In time.

159
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,918
<i>It's your disbelief that powers him.</i>

160
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:50,384
Your stubborn faith in...
In common sense...

161
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:52,796
that allows his deception.

162
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:59,093
He lives in
the smallest parts of it...

163
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,141
in the atoms.

164
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,898
Smaller,

165
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:05,946
invisible.

166
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:11,912
He lives in all of it...

167
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,556
in the sum of its parts.

168
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,324
We must translate
this book.

169
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:24,785
You must prove it
scientifically.

170
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,764
Convince the outside world.

171
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:31,091
The outside world doesn't want
to hear this kind of bullshit.

172
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,104
Just keep it locked away.

173
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,108
You've already managed that
for 2,000 years.

174
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:41,979
No prison can hold him now.

175
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:55,215
Hi.
HI.

176
00:20:55,363 --> 00:21:00,321
It's getting cold out here. I thought
this was supposed to be California.

177
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,890
Did you have a class tonight, or...
Library.

178
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,270
Oh. Actually, I was hoping you'd
have a cup of coffee with me again.

179
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,805
This is startin'
to become a habit.

180
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,574
Okay.
Okay.

181
00:22:10,572 --> 00:22:12,760
Good morning.

182
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,739
Thank you.

183
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,903
We didn't get much sleep.
Mmm.

184
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,882
Who needs sleep?

185
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:29,288
We do. Today's Friday.

186
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:31,679
Can I tell you something?

187
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:35,115
Oh, please, don't.
I want to.

188
00:22:35,263 --> 00:22:37,857
Tell me next time...

189
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:39,987
if there is one.

190
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:43,691
Or the time after that, or...

191
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,898
two years from now.

192
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,329
Who was he?

193
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:52,537
The one who gave you
such a high opinion of men?

194
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:58,639
I wouldn't like it if
either of us jumped to conclusions.

195
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:03,043
How do you know I was going to say
what you think I was gonna say?

196
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:05,921
Because if you don't,

197
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,925
I don't wanna know.

198
00:24:39,154 --> 00:24:41,208
Oh, please, don't tell me.

199
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,311
This place gives me the creeps.
Well, it was abandoned.

200
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:46,290
Hmm. I never would've guessed.

201
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:48,715
No, I hear it used to be
a beautiful church. When?

202
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:52,052
In the 1950s. My husband's
parents used to come here.

203
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,101
And then for some reason,
it was closed down.

204
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,467
Well!
Yeah.

205
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,034
Hi. I'm, uh, Leahy.
I'm looking for Birack.

206
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:10,304
Hi. Brian Marsh.
He's over in... There he is.

207
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:12,283
Ah. Thanks.

208
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:26,086
Professor Birack.
Yes.

209
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,722
Hi. I'm Paul Leahy.
Oh. Dr. Leahy.

210
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,636
I'm glad you could come. Yes. Well, now, all
I really know about what's goin' on here...

211
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:34,928
is what one of your students
told me on the telephone.

212
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,671
We're just getting organized. If you have
some equipment, find a spot over there.

213
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:41,543
All right.
We're making this the central lab.

214
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:46,176
Sure. Well, what are we
actually doing here?

215
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:58,389
Well, I gotta cover for Leahy over
the weekend. Extra credit seminar. Wow.

216
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:03,590
Hi, Frank.
Don't leave.

217
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:06,894
Excuse me.
I have to set up.

218
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,463
Hi.
Hello.

219
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,899
Frankie, who's that?

220
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:15,168
Susan Cabot.
Radiologist. Married.

221
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:17,905
Ah. How married?
Very.

222
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:19,884
Oh. Hi, Doc.
Hi. I'll be workin' upstairs.

223
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:22,442
I want you to set up the
basic panel down here. Right.

224
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,421
What are you supposed
to be testing?

225
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:26,914
I don't know.
Compounds? Basic structures?

226
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:30,691
When I know, you'll know.
Uh, Leahy.

227
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,854
Great.
Science marches on.

228
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:35,833
Yeah.

229
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:39,605
Need any help?
No, I'm okay.

230
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:43,335
There better be a diploma in my
mailbox when I get home on Monday.

231
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,694
I really can't believe this is
happening. I had a date tonight...

232
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:05,120
with this beautiful young
trial attorney from Century City.

233
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:07,963
Where were you taking him?
Please, it isn't funny.

234
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:15,206
<i>What are they doing?
They're watching us.</i>

235
00:27:15,376 --> 00:27:18,004
They started comin' around when
I got here at 9:00 this morning.

236
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,807
I'm Calder. Microbiology.
Brian Marsh.

237
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,537
Walter.
Lomax. Engineering.

238
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,705
Nice meeting you.
Hi.

239
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:27,274
Lomax.
How you doing?

240
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:29,476
So anybody know what
this whole deal's about yet?

241
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:31,819
Not a clue.
Nobody's got a clue.

242
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:36,616
I'm getting my doctorate
in theology.

243
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:39,358
Analysis of ancient scriptures.

244
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:43,834
This shouldn't be too difficult,
except for the numbers.

245
00:28:33,221 --> 00:28:36,777
It's so wonderful
what you're doing, Father,

246
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,553
opening the church again.

247
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:00,467
Are you all right?

248
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,515
We're ready.

249
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:44,618
<i>He's gaining strength.</i>

250
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,992
I can feel it all around us now.

251
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,697
So what's going on?

252
00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:38,865
Something downstairs.

253
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,675
Yeah? What?

254
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:46,286
I hate to tell you guys,
but this is real bullshit.

255
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:04,729
I know there's a reason why
nobody's opened this thing yet, right?

256
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,528
Let me have your pen
for a second.

257
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:11,965
Is this some kind of
toxic crap? Could be.

258
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:15,810
Okay, but I still don't understand
why we're not taking direct samples.

259
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:18,611
I mean, what's the big mystery?

260
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:32,319
<i>Catherine's entering these equations
upstairs. They're translated from Latin.</i>

261
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,298
Differential equations?

262
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:36,300
From a book written
2,000 years ago.

263
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:39,372
We hadn't invented
differential equations... Right.

264
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:31,311
<i>Professor Birack, I don't think
we have too much to worry about.</i>

265
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,189
The lid on that thing won't open.
Look.

266
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:36,193
It's incredibly elaborate.

267
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:39,519
Right here, there's a...
There's a weird locking mechanism.

268
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,431
Looks like it can only
be opened from the inside.

269
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:44,384
I'm going back.

270
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:46,659
Look at this.

271
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:52,559
Now, a friend of mine at U.C.L.A.
Did a study of chronic schizophrenics.

272
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:56,863
<i>They're supposed to have stereotyped routines
that they repeat every 20 minutes or so.</i>

273
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:01,000
You know, like a stuck record in their brains
repeating the same phrase over and over.

274
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:03,912
Well, I have been watching them
on and off all day,

275
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,985
and they don't seem
to be making any movements.

276
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:08,641
They just stand there.
With those kinds of problems,

277
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:11,811
I say let 'em stand there
if they want to. Ooh!

278
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,514
You okay?

279
00:34:14,662 --> 00:34:16,649
Yeah. I bumped into something
this afternoon.

280
00:34:16,797 --> 00:34:18,885
It's starting to hurt.
Probably nerves.

281
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,454
It's a bruise, Walter.
You don't bruise from nerves.

282
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:26,039
I used to break out when I was 12.
Doctor said it was homosexual panic.

283
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,813
I'll see you Monday morning.
You got anything for me?

284
00:34:35,983 --> 00:34:39,680
No, I'm afraid not. I'm guessing on the
acidity based upon the corrosion samples.

285
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,378
The figures you gave me.
Yeah.

286
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,643
Well, it can't be that high. Well,
I know, but you asked me to guess.

287
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,622
All right, get outta here.
Good night, sir.

288
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:49,559
Hey, what's with the "sir" business?
Okay, good night, Sir Doc.

289
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,062
Better.
A lot better.

290
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:17,819
My God.

291
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:32,585
Hey, look, can I talk
to you for a minute? Yes.

292
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,564
Nobody's really saying
much of anything here.

293
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:37,690
We're still putting together the first round of
tests, and nobody's really stopped since we got here.

294
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:40,159
Get to the point.

295
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:44,464
Nothing... anywhere ever is supposed
to be able to do what it is doing.

296
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:46,443
Now, settle down now.

297
00:36:46,614 --> 00:36:51,004
Go back to work. A life form is
growing out of pre-biotic fluid.

298
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:54,374
It's not winding down into disorder.
It's self-organizing.

299
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:58,011
It's becoming something.
What?

300
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,491
I mean, an animal?
A disease? What?

301
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,693
The hardest thing to hear for any of
us is something we don't agree with.

302
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:14,767
"I saw a star fall from heaven
unto the bottomless pit,

303
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,241
and he was cast out
as water from the flood... "

304
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:27,245
This is crazy.

305
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:53,766
Man.
Hadn't you seen it yet?

306
00:37:53,914 --> 00:37:58,544
No. For the last four hours, I've been
carbon dating the corrosion on the lid there.

307
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:01,347
We're talking about
seven million years.

308
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:04,777
What?
Yeah.

309
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:08,554
I'm goin' topside.

310
00:38:08,763 --> 00:38:12,028
Want me to wait for you?
No, uh-uh. Go on.

311
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:03,202
This whole section's a kind of history.
Part of it was indecipherable,

312
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,251
as if someone were deliberately
trying to erase it.

313
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,942
I managed to piece together most of it.
Okay, it kind of starts here.

314
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,313
"The container was buried somewhere
in the Middle East eons ago by... "

315
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:17,784
It gets a little wild here...
"the father of Satan,

316
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:20,019
"a god who once walked the earth
before man...

317
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,722
but was somehow banished
to the dark side. "

318
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,362
Apparently, the father
buried his son inside the container.

319
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,268
This was the section
someone was trying to erase.

320
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:32,071
Now later on here,
"Christ comes to warn us.

321
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:36,910
He was of extraterrestrial ancestry,
but a human-like race. "

322
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,000
Finally, they determine Christ is crazy,

323
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:45,847
but he's also gaining power converting a lot
of people to his beliefs, so they kill him.

324
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,142
But his disciples keep the secret
and hide it from civilization...

325
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,846
until man could develop a science sophisticated
enough to prove what Christ was saying.

326
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:56,724
Something like this can really
fuck up your weekend.

327
00:40:56,931 --> 00:41:01,487
How did the Roman Catholic Church manage
to keep this a secret for 2,000 years?

328
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:03,823
Apparently, a decision was made...

329
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:07,493
to characterize pure evil
as a spiritual force,

330
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:12,732
even within the darkness
in the hearts of men.

331
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,967
It was more convenient.

332
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:18,538
In that way, man remained
at the center of things.

333
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:21,587
A stupid lie.
We were salesmen, that's all.

334
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:25,144
We sold our product...

335
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:28,022
to those who didn't have it.

336
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:31,150
The new life.

337
00:41:31,298 --> 00:41:34,353
Reward ourselves,
punish our enemies...

338
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:36,867
so we can live without truth.

339
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:40,993
A substance,

340
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:43,095
malevolence.

341
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:45,331
That was the truth.

342
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:47,667
Asleep...

343
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:49,840
until now.

344
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:01,627
Help me break this up.
The others shouldn't hear this.

345
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:07,159
Faith is a hard thing to come
by these days. Look at this.

346
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,925
<i>That thing down therejust directed
a fairly sizable burst of energy.</i>

347
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:15,127
Directed?

348
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:19,109
In a straight line... with the precision
of less than a millisecond.

349
00:42:21,115 --> 00:42:25,239
Everybody's acting like we should
really be taking this seriously.

350
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:28,150
You two aren't taking
this seriously, are you?

351
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:47,171
What are we supposed to do?
Just go back to work?

352
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:49,595
What would you rather have,
a wreath of garlic?

353
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:53,406
A benediction?
A crucifix?

354
00:42:56,617 --> 00:43:00,840
Then it really is Old Scratch
knocking at the door.

355
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:05,652
<i>A few minutes ago, a vibration was triggered
in the metal on that thing downstairs.</i>

356
00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:07,691
A strong one.
Some kind of...

357
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:10,625
kinetic emission came out of it.

358
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:12,698
Now, if it can transmit
a signal strong enough...

359
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:15,254
It can move other objects...

360
00:43:15,402 --> 00:43:18,557
instantaneously across a distance...

361
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:20,536
Without outside intervention.

362
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:22,538
Psychokinesis.

363
00:43:23,777 --> 00:43:26,644
Mind-directed energy.

364
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:30,403
Don't tell the others yet.
Why not?

365
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:34,774
They have a right to know that this...
That it... it's conscious.

366
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:37,176
Not until you prove
it wasn't something else...

367
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:39,690
a power surge or a draft of air.

368
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,264
All right.

369
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,950
You missed the big history lesson.

370
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:14,122
You're not gonna believe
what's been going on up here.

371
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:38,216
Want one?

372
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,715
Anyone ever tell you that
you could pass for Asian?

373
00:44:45,092 --> 00:44:46,992
Whew.

374
00:44:49,796 --> 00:44:52,351
What was that all about?
No sense of humor.

375
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:54,194
Have you seen Susan?
Who?

376
00:44:54,368 --> 00:44:57,599
Radiologist, glasses.
Oh, yeah. She's right outside.

377
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:05,074
Where?

378
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,942
She was there. I think
somebody oughta tell her.

379
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,651
Look, am I crazy, or are we
stroking ourselves heavily here?

380
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,561
Thank you for taking the time
to share your thoughts.

381
00:45:47,154 --> 00:45:48,985
Susan?

382
00:45:58,899 --> 00:46:00,696
There's more to it.

383
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,269
There's some kind of power...
Directed outward.

384
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:19,248
A controlled force.

385
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:23,442
<i>What's it doing?
Reaching out.</i>

386
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,888
Influencing.

387
00:46:27,027 --> 00:46:28,858
Changing things.

388
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,058
Moving objects by thought.

389
00:46:37,404 --> 00:46:39,235
<i>Extraordinary intervention.</i>

390
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:42,239
Intelligent cause other than man.

391
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,414
Susan?

392
00:46:52,786 --> 00:46:55,050
<i>Hello?</i>

393
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,111
Suppose...

394
00:47:55,282 --> 00:48:00,239
what your faith has said
was essentially correct.

395
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:04,610
Suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything.

396
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:09,422
A god willing the behavior
of every subatomic particle.

397
00:48:10,797 --> 00:48:15,387
Now, every particle
has an anti-particle.

398
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:18,368
Its mirror image.

399
00:48:18,538 --> 00:48:20,826
Its negative side.

400
00:48:20,974 --> 00:48:24,774
Maybe this universal mind...

401
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:29,235
resides in the mirror image
instead of in our universe...

402
00:48:29,383 --> 00:48:31,977
as we wanted to believe.

403
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,475
Maybe he's anti-God,

404
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,844
bringing darkness instead of light.

405
00:48:38,992 --> 00:48:41,981
Why weren't we told the truth?

406
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:46,285
<i>Without the technology to confirm,</i>

407
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:48,264
<i>it would have been another legend.</i>

408
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:50,926
But he was our prisoner, not yours!

409
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:55,194
<i>We had a responsibility...</i>

410
00:48:55,342 --> 00:48:57,606
<i>to warn the rest of the world.</i>

411
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:01,967
Only the corrupt
are listened to now,

412
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:06,279
and they tell us
what we want to hear.

413
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:10,720
We believe it to be divine light.

414
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:15,593
It just got colder in here.

415
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:18,183
I know.

416
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:20,452
Suddenly, as if...

417
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,364
as if something...

418
00:49:23,537 --> 00:49:26,097
moved through the room.

419
00:49:35,215 --> 00:49:37,046
Listen, do you realize
what's going on up there?

420
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:39,405
We are on the brink
of the ultimate truth!

421
00:49:39,553 --> 00:49:41,640
Oh, this priest is a real case.

422
00:49:41,788 --> 00:49:45,844
He is looney tunes, and I'm
beginning to wonder about Birack too.

423
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:48,547
I'm going back.
Come on, Calder.

424
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:51,528
Come on, Frank!

425
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:57,000
You're outta your minds!
This is a joke. This is caca.

426
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,069
Come on!

427
00:50:07,914 --> 00:50:10,474
Caca.

428
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:59,718
Hello?

429
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:17,803
Where's Wyndham?
Uh, he left.

430
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,567
When?

431
00:52:21,715 --> 00:52:24,036
<i>Oh, about 20 minutes ago.</i>

432
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,271
We tried to talk him out of it,
but, uh...

433
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:29,149
Has anyone seen Susan?
Who?

434
00:52:29,322 --> 00:52:32,689
The radiologist. Glasses?

435
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:36,158
<i>Well, maybe she left too.</i>

436
00:52:37,397 --> 00:52:39,763
Maybe they both had
the right idea.

437
00:53:12,532 --> 00:53:16,788
<i>This is not a dream.
Not a dream.</i>

438
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:21,026
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

439
00:53:21,174 --> 00:53:24,837
<i>We are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro-interference.</i>

440
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:29,268
<i>You are receiving
this broadcast as a dream.</i>

441
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:32,180
<i>We are transmitting from the year 1-9...</i>

442
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:36,315
Walter?

443
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:38,043
What?
Have you seen Mullins?

444
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:40,646
What? No.
Susan?

445
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:42,625
Who?
Radiologist. Glasses.

446
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:44,783
Come on, man.
I was asleep.

447
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:48,987
We can't find them.
And Wyndham's left.

448
00:53:49,135 --> 00:53:52,391
Couple of the others are talking about leaving.
We're gonna have a meeting in the lab in half an hour.

449
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:54,826
Mullins left?
I don't know.

450
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:56,805
I'm gonna go downstairs
and look for him.

451
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,980
Well, since I'm up now.

452
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:26,963
If I don't come back,
you can have my Porsche.

453
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:31,156
<i>You are receiving this broadcast in order
to alter the events you are seeing.</i>

454
00:55:31,304 --> 00:55:34,359
<i>Our technology has not developed
a transmitter strong enough...</i>

455
00:55:34,507 --> 00:55:36,771
<i>to reach your conscious
and your awareness.</i>

456
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,947
What were you dreaming?

457
00:55:44,117 --> 00:55:47,314
Your kingdom, Father, does
not include my unconscious.

458
00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:53,545
It's mine, and I may abuse it
any way I wish...

459
00:55:53,693 --> 00:55:56,321
without having to confess
what's in it.

460
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,718
<i>Something I haven't
told you.</i>

461
00:55:59,866 --> 00:56:03,632
The Brotherhood of Sleep...

462
00:56:03,837 --> 00:56:06,391
Anyone in close proximity...

463
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:08,598
has the same dream.

464
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:12,538
<i>The one you had
just now.</i>

465
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:38,262
Um...
Excuse me, but I...

466
00:56:51,918 --> 00:56:55,513
The guardian priests had
the dream for years.

467
00:56:55,688 --> 00:56:58,350
What does it mean?

468
00:56:59,926 --> 00:57:02,180
A premonition.

469
00:57:02,328 --> 00:57:04,956
The dream evolves,
unfolds.

470
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:08,430
We shall start to have it
every time we go to sleep.

471
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:13,268
As if it's pushing
everything else out.

472
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:17,308
Making room for itself.

473
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:20,745
Mullins?

474
00:57:25,218 --> 00:57:27,172
Do you think he really
just took off?

475
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,312
I mean, like he was actually
believing this whole business?

476
00:57:31,557 --> 00:57:33,457
Why is everybody
looking at me that way?

477
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:37,221
'Cause you're being asshole-ish. That's
very asshole-ish of you to say so.

478
00:57:37,397 --> 00:57:39,918
Look, Mullins is probably
off asleep someplace.

479
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:42,087
Or he's boffing
the radiologist.

480
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:46,365
I hope he's getting laid. I hope they're both
on their way to a nice Chinese restaurant.

481
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,584
How can you keep
working like this?

482
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:14,719
It's... 3:30.

483
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,122
No wonder I'm so tired.

484
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,033
I keep getting these figures
in the computer,

485
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:21,036
but they're not
making any sense.

486
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,461
I stopped making sense
about 15 minutes ago.

487
00:58:23,609 --> 00:58:26,203
No, I mean these equations
are beyond me now.

488
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:29,405
They're like another language. Mmm.

489
00:58:30,717 --> 00:58:33,138
Go get some sleep.
I'll wake you in half an hour.

490
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:35,754
Oh, 45 minutes?
Okay.

491
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,544
Hey, are you okay?

492
00:58:39,692 --> 00:58:42,388
No.

493
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:44,983
I know what you mean.

494
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:48,862
I just want to go home, pretend
none of this is really happening.

495
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:53,792
What's that?
Hmm?

496
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,500
Oh, it's just a bruise
I got somehow.

497
00:58:57,877 --> 00:59:00,072
Finally stopped hurting.

498
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,111
This looks like a figure
of some kind.

499
00:59:03,282 --> 00:59:05,337
No, I got to close my eyes. Okay.

500
00:59:05,485 --> 00:59:07,578
I'll wake you.
Thanks.

501
00:59:25,038 --> 00:59:27,559
Hello.

502
00:59:27,707 --> 00:59:32,110
I'm opening the door, if you want to stop
what you're doing and put your clothes on.

503
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,117
Big doings in the lab tonight.
There's a meeting.

504
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,645
Oh, give me just 15 minutes.

505
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:49,159
You want me to come back?
Later.

506
00:59:57,904 --> 00:59:59,925
Any luck?
Can't find anybody.

507
01:00:00,073 --> 01:00:03,600
I'm going up to the lab.
I'll be there in a minute.

508
01:00:06,212 --> 01:00:08,300
We're having a meeting
in the lab.

509
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:10,678
<i>Lisa!</i>

510
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:15,047
Mona Lisa!

511
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:22,718
Lisa?

512
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:32,150
This whole building is gonna
have to be encased in concrete.

513
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:35,286
No way. A building this size? I
say we launch the fucker into space.

514
01:01:35,434 --> 01:01:37,334
I'm hearing something.

515
01:02:01,928 --> 01:02:04,624
Where are the others?
We think they've left.

516
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:06,924
Kelly's asleep. I didn't
want to wake her up.

517
01:02:08,734 --> 01:02:11,122
I'm asking you to stay.

518
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,068
The work that we do in the
next 48 hours is critical.

519
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,662
How many of you have fallen
asleep tonight? Please, tell me.

520
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,404
<i>Come on. Please.</i>

521
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:26,112
<i>You dreamed... You dreamed about
the front of this church.</i>

522
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,018
About a dark figure coming out.

523
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,782
Didn't you...
Didn't you feel it?

524
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:38,483
<i>Not like a dream.</i>

525
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:42,192
<i>Like something else.
Here.</i>

526
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,570
<i>I had the dream too.</i>

527
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:51,830
This image of something that didn't
seem to belong to my subconscious.

528
01:02:51,978 --> 01:02:55,266
Almost if I was watching
something prerecorded.

529
01:02:55,414 --> 01:02:57,869
<i>Tachyons?
One possibility.</i>

530
01:02:58,017 --> 01:03:02,307
<i>What's that?
- It's a Greek word.</i>

531
01:03:02,455 --> 01:03:04,286
It means "swift one. "

532
01:03:04,457 --> 01:03:08,325
So what is the dream?
Huh? Precognition?

533
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:12,784
Previous knowledge
of a future event?

534
01:03:12,932 --> 01:03:16,221
A shared vision of something
that is yet to occur?

535
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:19,791
<i>Caused by that thing
downstairs? Perhaps not.</i>

536
01:03:19,939 --> 01:03:23,962
Tachyon is a subatomic particle
that travels faster than light.

537
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,941
<i>Supposing it isn't a dream.</i>

538
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:29,134
Supposing it's a message.

539
01:03:29,282 --> 01:03:33,013
What if these dreams,
premonitions, omens...

540
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,673
<i>What if they're really...</i>

541
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:38,877
<i>visual messages sent
by other human beings?</i>

542
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:41,579
Photographs.
Video signals.

543
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:44,315
<i>From where?
The future.</i>

544
01:03:44,463 --> 01:03:47,261
Anything traveling faster
than the speed of light...

545
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:49,487
would appear to be
going backward in time.

546
01:03:49,635 --> 01:03:52,502
A future scientist calculates
the exact spot...

547
01:03:52,672 --> 01:03:54,826
that the Earth occupied
in space in the past,

548
01:03:54,974 --> 01:03:57,568
given trajectory and speed.

549
01:03:57,743 --> 01:04:00,439
He then beams
a tachyon signal...

550
01:04:00,613 --> 01:04:02,444
at that spot,

551
01:04:02,615 --> 01:04:06,604
transmitting video information
backwards through time.

552
01:04:06,752 --> 01:04:11,109
For us to receive as electrical
impulses, neural stimulus.

553
01:04:11,257 --> 01:04:14,279
Man, oh, man.
For what purpose?

554
01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:15,880
<i>Could be a warning.</i>

555
01:04:16,028 --> 01:04:18,583
To show us
what's going to happen.

556
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,952
A sort of...

557
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,555
remote camera view
of the future,

558
01:04:23,703 --> 01:04:26,103
so that we can change it.

559
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,544
Someone has finally
shown up to tell us.

560
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:44,215
I think it's time we stood up
for what we are.

561
01:04:46,392 --> 01:04:49,293
I think there's something wrong with
this. I'm not getting anything now.

562
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:51,555
It's gone dead.

563
01:04:55,768 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>Maybe the generator's dead. No, it looks
more like the units downstairs were cut off.</i>

564
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:10,635
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

565
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:12,614
Hey, Wyndham!

566
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,586
Hello? Hello?

567
01:05:21,594 --> 01:05:23,494
Come here.
Look at this.

568
01:05:30,936 --> 01:05:34,192
I've got a message for you.

569
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,928
And you're not
going to like it.

570
01:05:37,076 --> 01:05:39,203
Look at his chest.

571
01:05:43,516 --> 01:05:46,576
Pray for death.

572
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:54,050
Jesus Christ!

573
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:33,721
Calder?

574
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,710
No, Calder!
No! No!

575
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:35,058
Oh...

576
01:07:38,564 --> 01:07:40,395
no.

577
01:08:15,734 --> 01:08:17,634
Kelly?

578
01:09:28,741 --> 01:09:31,141
Aah!

579
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:41,606
Hey. Hey, you guys!

580
01:09:41,754 --> 01:09:43,875
They got the back doors
blocked away there.

581
01:09:44,023 --> 01:09:46,410
What the hell's
happening here?

582
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,914
The back doors are locked!

583
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:53,156
You okay?
Check the windows?

584
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:10,743
<i>What's going on here?</i>

585
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,970
<i>We can't get out!</i>

586
01:10:13,118 --> 01:10:15,484
- It's in here!
Don't come in here!

587
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:17,910
Go, go, go!

588
01:11:19,118 --> 01:11:21,382
Lock the door!

589
01:11:22,421 --> 01:11:24,855
Come on!
Get over here!

590
01:13:42,594 --> 01:13:44,755
The sun's coming up.

591
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:36,511
Normally, I love
being dominated by women.

592
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:42,406
Lisa, I'm sorry about
what I said before.

593
01:14:42,554 --> 01:14:46,081
You don't look Asian
at all.

594
01:14:48,894 --> 01:14:50,794
Shit.

595
01:14:50,963 --> 01:14:54,057
I thought I heard Walter.

596
01:15:01,406 --> 01:15:05,035
Walter? Walter!

597
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:11,936
<i>What the fuck do you want?
Where are you?</i>

598
01:15:12,084 --> 01:15:14,382
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

599
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:23,753
Hey. Can you dig through
and get me out of here?

600
01:15:27,499 --> 01:15:30,332
I don't know. The wall's
pretty thick. Are you all right?

601
01:15:30,502 --> 01:15:33,096
<i>Well, that's a relative
thing right now, but yeah.</i>

602
01:15:34,172 --> 01:15:36,231
<i>Wait a second.</i>

603
01:15:45,384 --> 01:15:47,045
They're just standing there
outside.

604
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:50,307
Not trying to get in. They've
stopped attacking for some reason.

605
01:15:50,455 --> 01:15:52,977
Walter, where are you,
exactly?

606
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:55,025
<i>I'm in this closet.</i>

607
01:15:56,161 --> 01:15:58,415
I think we can
get through with this.

608
01:15:58,563 --> 01:16:00,326
It's gonna take a while.

609
01:16:00,499 --> 01:16:02,786
Walter, we're gonna
try and dig through.

610
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:06,523
<i>How long will it take?
A couple ofhours.</i>

611
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:09,367
Oh, great. I'll tell you what.
I'll hang out here anyway.

612
01:17:19,377 --> 01:17:22,005
Well, get ready
to pull me back.

613
01:17:35,827 --> 01:17:38,728
<i>Come on, Brian. Come here.
Come on, Brian.</i>

614
01:17:38,897 --> 01:17:40,558
Come on! Let's go!
Now!

615
01:17:40,732 --> 01:17:43,854
<i>Come on! Come up here.
Come on, man. Hurry up!</i>

616
01:17:44,002 --> 01:17:46,800
<i>Come on! Come on, Brian.</i>

617
01:17:46,972 --> 01:17:50,567
<i>Come on! Come on, Brian.
Come on!</i>

618
01:17:54,779 --> 01:17:56,770
Come on.

619
01:18:00,819 --> 01:18:02,878
You guys seen
any movies you like?

620
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,064
All right.

621
01:18:27,212 --> 01:18:29,840
AJewish mother goes to the airport
to meet her daughter.

622
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:34,271
The daughter steps off the plane
with an eight-foot-tall Zulu warrior...

623
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,250
with a bone through his nose.

624
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:38,542
The mother screams,
"You fool!

625
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,954
I said a rich doctor!"

626
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:55,401
<i>Not a dream.</i>

627
01:18:55,574 --> 01:18:59,530
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

628
01:18:59,678 --> 01:19:04,411
<i>We are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro-interference.</i>

629
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,905
<i>You are receiving this broadcast
as a dream.</i>

630
01:19:08,053 --> 01:19:11,580
<i>We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9...</i>

631
01:19:34,946 --> 01:19:37,534
We can try the hallway
after it gets dark.

632
01:19:37,682 --> 01:19:41,174
If I can make my way up front, I could
break some windows, call for help.

633
01:19:43,455 --> 01:19:46,151
No one out there
can help us.

634
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,113
The other morning you said that
you had something to tell me.

635
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:17,213
And you probably...

636
01:20:17,389 --> 01:20:19,516
think that none of that
matters now.

637
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:24,047
But you're wrong.

638
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,026
It's the only thing
that does.

639
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,960
<i>Worker ants, driven
to a higher purpose,</i>

640
01:21:33,131 --> 01:21:35,565
unknown
to the individual.

641
01:21:36,868 --> 01:21:38,989
Street people...

642
01:21:39,137 --> 01:21:41,435
our colleagues,
all controlled.

643
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,770
<i>Demonic possession?
Of a kind.</i>

644
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:52,169
<i>Not what we would
expect, though. Never that.</i>

645
01:21:52,317 --> 01:21:55,472
Why would he need us?

646
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:58,675
The book says his purpose
is to bring the Father...

647
01:21:58,823 --> 01:22:02,725
back from the dark side,
wherever that is.

648
01:22:02,894 --> 01:22:05,415
<i>There could be a limit as to
what he could do, you know,</i>

649
01:22:05,563 --> 01:22:08,430
as a volume of liquid.

650
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,367
He controls simple
organisms easily.

651
01:22:13,538 --> 01:22:17,995
But maybe he needs something more
complex to complete a life cycle,

652
01:22:18,143 --> 01:22:19,830
<i>a host in which to live.</i>

653
01:22:19,978 --> 01:22:24,472
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

654
01:22:24,783 --> 01:22:28,446
- Walter?
- It's Kelly. She's changing again.

655
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:33,110
<i>The swelling's gone down, as if the
liquid was absorbed into her system.</i>

656
01:22:33,258 --> 01:22:35,646
<i>I can see tissue changes
on her face.</i>

657
01:22:35,794 --> 01:22:38,115
Also, I think
her bone structure is changing.

658
01:22:38,263 --> 01:22:43,257
Maybe this is the only way
he could actualize his power.

659
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:47,658
A parasite
growing into its host.

660
01:22:47,806 --> 01:22:50,827
This could be
some kind of gestation period.

661
01:22:50,975 --> 01:22:53,130
I know I'd seen it before.

662
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:56,600
Kelly had a mark. It was a
bruise, almost like a figure.

663
01:22:56,748 --> 01:22:59,444
I saw it in a history book...
The astrologer's staff,

664
01:22:59,617 --> 01:23:02,313
used in ritual magic
in the middle ages.

665
01:23:02,487 --> 01:23:05,042
The mark was on her?
Yes.

666
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:07,920
As if she were chosen.

667
01:23:08,092 --> 01:23:10,647
- Walter!
- What?

668
01:23:10,795 --> 01:23:15,218
<i>Keep watching her closely.
Anything that you see, tell us!</i>

669
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:17,587
I have to go
to the bathroom.

670
01:23:17,735 --> 01:23:21,330
God... and Father...

671
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:25,762
of our Lord...

672
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:28,504
Jesus Christ.

673
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,668
I appeal to your...

674
01:23:31,816 --> 01:23:33,716
holy name,

675
01:23:35,153 --> 01:23:37,883
humbly begging that You...

676
01:23:41,926 --> 01:23:44,952
will grant us help...

677
01:23:47,031 --> 01:23:49,261
against this...

678
01:23:52,604 --> 01:23:55,625
unclean...

679
01:23:55,773 --> 01:23:57,604
spirit.

680
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:11,108
Thou...

681
01:24:11,256 --> 01:24:13,744
tormenteth these creatures...

682
01:24:13,892 --> 01:24:15,792
of hell.

683
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:22,195
Through Jesus Christ,
our Lord.

684
01:24:55,366 --> 01:24:57,687
Look down...

685
01:24:57,835 --> 01:25:00,429
upon these, Thy servants,

686
01:25:00,605 --> 01:25:04,405
caught in the coils of...

687
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:21,017
Where are You?

688
01:25:25,597 --> 01:25:27,497
Christ,

689
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:34,170
where are You?

690
01:25:45,383 --> 01:25:47,010
Holy shit!

691
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,876
<i>Get me the hell out ofhere!
Help me! Help me get out ofhere!</i>

692
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,145
They're gonna kill me!
I don't want to die!

693
01:25:55,293 --> 01:25:57,193
Help me! Help!

694
01:25:57,362 --> 01:25:59,616
<i>Help me!</i>

695
01:25:59,764 --> 01:26:02,858
Behind the door. Behind
the door! You can't, Brian!

696
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:07,357
Oh, God! Help!

697
01:26:07,505 --> 01:26:10,531
Help me! Oh.

698
01:26:35,767 --> 01:26:37,234
Hey!

699
01:27:13,304 --> 01:27:15,067
Aah!

700
01:28:32,316 --> 01:28:34,546
Come on!

701
01:29:05,683 --> 01:29:08,277
It's not working!

702
01:29:18,129 --> 01:29:22,828
Father!

703
01:30:54,926 --> 01:30:57,486
Father!

704
01:31:40,137 --> 01:31:42,325
I could.

705
01:31:42,473 --> 01:31:44,771
I could.

706
01:32:00,658 --> 01:32:02,489
Unclean spirit.

707
01:33:09,393 --> 01:33:12,988
Father.

708
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:19,459
Come to freedom!

709
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:10,344
No!

710
01:35:42,213 --> 01:35:45,802
We stopped it.

711
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,975
We stopped it here.

712
01:35:50,054 --> 01:35:52,352
<i>Through the grace of God,</i>

713
01:35:53,591 --> 01:35:55,678
<i>I stopped it.</i>

714
01:35:55,826 --> 01:35:58,590
The future conjured up by the...

715
01:36:00,731 --> 01:36:03,632
that vile serpent...

716
01:36:04,735 --> 01:36:06,862
will not happen now.

717
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:24,006
<i>The smaller parts
could not live...</i>

718
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:26,019
<i>without the strength
of the whole.</i>

719
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:29,479
They had to die,
to fade away,

720
01:36:29,627 --> 01:36:33,256
as the whole was thrown
back and repelled.

721
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:37,920
We're safe,

722
01:36:38,068 --> 01:36:40,764
but he's waiting
on the other side.

723
01:36:44,108 --> 01:36:46,406
She died for us.

724
01:36:50,814 --> 01:36:53,408
<i>This is not a dream.
Not a dream.</i>

725
01:36:54,718 --> 01:36:58,518
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

726
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:03,388
<i>We are unable to transmit through
conscious neuro-interference.</i>

727
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:07,150
<i>You are receiving this broadcast
as a dream.</i>

728
01:37:07,298 --> 01:37:12,388
<i>We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9-9.</i>

729
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:17,660
<i>You are receiving this broadcast in
order to alter the events you are seeing.</i>

730
01:37:17,808 --> 01:37:20,863
<i>Our technology is known to those
with transmitters strong enough...</i>

731
01:37:21,011 --> 01:37:24,167
<i>to reach your conscious
state of awareness.</i>

732
01:37:24,315 --> 01:37:26,536
<i>But this is not a dream.</i>

733
01:37:26,684 --> 01:37:29,414
<i>You are seeing
what is actually occurring...</i>

734
01:37:29,586 --> 01:37:32,885
<i>for the purpose
of causality violation.</i>
