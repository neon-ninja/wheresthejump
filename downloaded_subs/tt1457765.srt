An old man I met.

172

He said there was a swing set in the woods,
just like in my dream.

The previous owner?

Yeah, the bank owned it.

231
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,285
Before that. Check it out.

232
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,723
Straight from the county assessor.

233
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,731
Look at the name at the bottom.

234
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,449
The Gordy family owned all this land
going back 200 years,

235
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,205
and this J.S. Gordy was the last one.

236
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,323
Then the bank got it in the '70s.

237

Ask me how they got it.

out of 50 pictures. Explain that.

That's just your influence coming out in her.

You know what, I don't want you talking

Why would she? You don't listen.

260
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,163
You just tell her what's what,
just like you did with me.

The property is special because
back around the time of the Civil War,

283
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,764
it was the Station Master's land.
But I'm sure you knew that.

284
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,524
What, like a rail road?

285
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,126
No tracks on this land.

286
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,567
No, it wasn't that kind of rail road.

287
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,484
Do you mean, like,
the Underground Railroad?

288
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,169
The folks who helped escaped slaves
make it up north? Wow.

289
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,011
That's right. Those people
were known as station masters

290
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,689
and one of the most well-known
lived right here on your land.

291
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,967
He actually hid slaves on our property?

292

Yes, ma'am.

293
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,562
Hundreds of men, women and children
passed right through here

294
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,008
with nothing but the clothes on their back
and the light of the moon to guide them.

295
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,605

No, sweetie.

297
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,529
They couldn't even use lanterns.

298
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,329
The moonlight was the only light
that they ever saw.

299

He said I shouldn't have
gone down in that hole.

717
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,209
He said I let something bad come out.

We can't be here anymore, Mama.

721
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,244
I went in the hole and the bad man saw me.

722
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,485
He knows we're here now and he's coming.

723
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,684
What bad man, sweetie?

724
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,684
The Station Master.

725
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,446
- I let him out, Mama.
- Well, Mr. Gordy is wrong,

726
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,251
because you know very well
that the Station Master was a good man.

727
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,090
No, he wasn't.

Andy, will you please tell her
that there is nothing to be afraid of?

729
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,721
Mr. Gordy said there was money buried
in the garden, Lisa, and there was.

730
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,448
He said that

731
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,205
something terrible happened here. It did.

732
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,082
For something in Heidi's mind,
Mr. Gordy is sure as hell right a lot.

733

Are you telling me that suddenly
you believe all this?

734
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,328
I believe there was a cave
full of skeletons on our land, Lisa.
