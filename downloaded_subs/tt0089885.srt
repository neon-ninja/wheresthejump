1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,250
(screaming and crying within)

2
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,393
Doktor Gruber!

3
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,691
Herr Doktor!

4
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:40,269
Herr West!

5
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,693
Herr West!
Raus comen!

6
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,648
(crash within)

7
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,788
Move back.

8
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,053
Mein Gott!

9
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:11,116
(screaming)

10
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:15,496
No, you idiots!
You'll ruin my notes!

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,262
I have to record his
vital signs!

12
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,408
No!

13
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:25,241
Doktor Gruber?!
Wie Gehtsen?!

14
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:31,718
Doctor Gruber?

15
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:49,681
Er ist tot.

16
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:52,965
Of course he's dead -
the dosage was too large.

17
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,445
- You killed him!
- No, I did not.

18
00:01:58,156 --> 00:02:00,656
I gave him life.

19
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:54,259
Alright, we'll zap her again.

20
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:55,551
Charge up the paddles.

21
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,801
- Come on, let's go!
- Sorry, Doctor.

22
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,014
Hold the compressions.

23
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:04,617
Clear!

24
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,113
Straight line.

25
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,117
Alright, let's call it.

26
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:17,037
Cain.

27
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,997
She just needs a little more time
for the drugs to circulate.

28
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,624
Cain, we have done everything
that can be done for this woman.

29
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,129
She has not responded.

30
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:29,791
She's gone!

31
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,613
Cain, your optimism is touching,
but a waste of time.

32
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,613
A good doctor knows when to stop.

33
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,783
- Doctor Harris..
- Tag her...

34
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,470
...and take her to the morgue.

35
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,159
Gangway.

36
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,376
Mister Cain.

37
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,082
Hey, Ace -
I've got another one for you.

38
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:12,054
Doc Hill's in the autopsy room.

39
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:14,052
Thanks.

40
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,512
Don't know why they keep
locked doors around here...

41
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,777
...nobody wants in, and
ain't nobody gettin' out.

42
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:23,911
Yup.

43
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:52,072
I'm sorry Dan, I didn't
mean to scare you.

44
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,076
It wasn't bad, Dean Halsey.
I didn't know anybody was here.

45
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,834
You mean anybody else.

46
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,248
Dan, this is Herbert West. He'll be
joining you in your third year.

47
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:03,111
He was doing independent research
in Switzerland with Dr. Gruber

48
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,111
shortly before he died.

49
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:06,586
Mr. West, this is Daniel Cain -

50
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:10,755
- one of Miskatonic Medical's best young
hopes for the future of medicine.

51
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,594
- What were you researching?
- Death.

52
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,934
Ah, Alan! We don't see you
around here much anymore.

53
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:21,313
I was just showing our newest student,
Herbert West, the not so Grand Tour.

54
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,529
This should interest you, Carl -
he worked with Hans Gruber.

55
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,650
Ah, Mr. West?

56
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,955
This is our eminent brain researcher
and "grant machine"

57
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:33,790
Dr Carl Hill.

58
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,460
I know your work,
Dr Hill - quite well.

59
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,339
Your theory on the location
of the will in the brain is...

60
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,296
...interesting...

61
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:46,631
...though derivative of Dr Gruber's
research in the early '70s.

62
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:50,348
So derivative that in Europe
it's considered plaigerized.

63
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:54,477
And your support of the 12 minute limit
on the life of the brain stem after death...

64
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,691
Six to twelve minutes, Mister, uh...
- West.

65
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,943
Herbert West.

66
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,946
Frankly, Doctor, uh...

67
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,152
...Hill?...

68
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:06,320
...your work on brain
death is outdated.

69
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,539
Carl, while I remember

70
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,530
we're having a grand
committee meeting Thursday.

71
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:15,916
Megan and I would love it
if you came to dinner.

72
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,799
Well, I'd love to, Alan -
looking forward to it.

73
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,334
And looking forward to seeing you

74
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:23,011
in class, Mister West.

75
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,427
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:48,039
No! No! No!

77
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes! Oh! Yes! Oh!

78
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,356
Oh! Rufus!

79
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,895
I have to go.

80
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:20,859
No, stay.

81
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,576
- Dad knows I'm here.
- I don't care what Dean Halsey knows.

82
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,788
Be resasonable.

83
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:30,747
If I didn't come home
one night...just one night.

84
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:33,916
What would he do?
Expell me?

85
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,755
He's out of touch
with the times.

86
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,046
It's just the way he is.

87
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,299
The world's last
living Puritan.

88
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:46,057
I really hate it.

89
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,304
The day that you graduate...

90
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,773
...the minute you get your
M.D., I'll marry you.

91
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,240
And I'll help you, and
I'll be with you

92
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,407
as much as I can until then.

93
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,158
I promise.

94
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,827
Back to Square One.

95
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,287
Well, at least it gives me a
chance to house break you.

96
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,664
House broken, eh?

97
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,347
I'm going to have to teach
you a lesson, My Dear.

98
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,258
What are you doing?

99
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:28,289
Yeaaaow!

100
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:30,314
Dan! (laughs)

101
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:34,720
Dan, stop! Don't!

102
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:35,959
(evil laugh)

103
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,690
Dan!

104
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,359
- Stop it!
- Oh, My Pretty!

105
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,402
I don't like that!

106
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:41,443
No!

107
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:45,743
Ah, there's not a jury in the
world that will convict me...

108
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,911
(laughs)
Doctor Dan!

109
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:52,131
Don't! Come on, stop!

110
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,873
- I'm going - I have to go!
- Come here!

111
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,180
Hi. Can I help you?

112
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:08,774
- You're here about the apartment?
- Yes.

113
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:11,691
Didn't we meet this morning, ah...

114
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,736
West.
Herbert West.

115
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,856
...West. Excuse me just one second.

116
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,865
- Come in.
- Thank you.

117
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,834
- I startled you.
- Yes, you did.

118
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,887
May I introduce my fiance,
Megan Halsey.

119
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:38,806
Miss Halsey.

120
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,475
Mister West.

121
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,555
I'm afraid the place is still
kind of a mess, Mr West.

122
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:45,351
Herbert.

123
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:58,657
So, you've just come
from Europe?

124
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,199
Switzerland

125
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:04,209
What was Dr Gruber like?
He was pretty famous.

126
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,788
Yes, pretty famous.
Does this building have a basement?

127
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,940
Oh, yes.

128
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,040
Yes

129
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,141
I think this will be just fine!

130
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:25,597
I have my things outside.
Shall I move in now?

131
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,773
Ah, look - I have to go.

132
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,262
I think you and Mr West
have a lot to discuss

133
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,490
before you decide anything.

134
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,741
Oh, I've decided!

135
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,454
- Well...I'd like to...
- You'll never even know that I'm here.

136
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,703
- Dan...
- That goes on the first of the month.

137
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,576
Mister West.

138
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,080
Miss Halsey?

139
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:47,295
You didn't say why
you left Switzerland.

140
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:53,218
There was no more
I could learn there.

141
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,888
Do we have a deal?

142
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:04,847
Done

143
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:07,772
Done

144
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:13,190
You make the incision at
the base of the skull...

145
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,049
...cutting away enough of the facia...

146
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,180
...to get your fingers in.

147
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:41,477
And then, grasping firmly
with both hands...

148
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:44,728
...you pull the skin

149
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:47,444
forward over the head.

150
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,030
It's very much like peeling
a large orange.

151
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:56,990
Once the skull is
plainly visible...

152
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,535
...you take the bone saw...

153
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:05,210
...and you cut around
the perimeter.

154
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,643
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen...

155
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,644
...the human brain.

156
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:26,479
Once the brain stem of
an individual -

157
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,480
- I'm talking about the
reticular activating system -

158
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,108
- heart regulation, respiratory center -

159
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:34,864
- once these activities cease...

160
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:39,162
...the brain can only survive an
additional 6 to 12 minutes.

161
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,871
Six to twelve minutes.

162
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:46,713
Until...

163
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:52,760
...brain death brings about an
irreversible conclusion.

164
00:16:02,152 --> 00:16:05,272
We all want to retain our
personalities

165
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,696
in some idyllic afterlife.

166
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:10,578
We all pray for
some miracle...

167
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,447
some drug,

168
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,080
potion, pill...

169
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,005
Perhaps, though,

170
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:25,002
it takes something else.

171
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:27,420
Perhaps it takes desire -

172
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,631
- an obsessive desire.

173
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,556
Perhaps it takes...

174
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:40,734
We will discuss the
location of the will

175
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:43,862
in the brain structure
at another time.

176
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:47,032
Mister West!

177
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:50,578
I suggest you get
yourself a pen!

178
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:54,077
Class dismissed.

179
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:59,291
How can you teach such drivel!
These people are here to learn,

180
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,463
and you're closing their minds
before they even have a chance!

181
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:02,838
What are you here for,
Mr West?!

182
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,880
You know, you should have
stolen more of Gruber's ideas...

183
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,434
...then at least
you'd have ideas!

184
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,174
Mister West!

185
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:14,140
It is going to be
a pleasure to fail you.

186
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:25,026
I would like to propose a toast.

187
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,601
To the National
Science Foundation

188
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,665
for recognizing the genius
of Dr Carl Hill...

189
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:36,043
...and for awarding
Miskatonic Medical School

190
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,496
its largest grant ever!

191
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:42,542
Your new laser drill is going to
revolutionize neurosurgery.

192
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,631
To the Foundation -
and to Miskatonic!

193
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:53,328
It's alright, Sweetheart,
you can drink up.

194
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,420
We're celebrating!

195
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,820
I know, Daddy, but
I have to go soon.

196
00:17:56,537 --> 00:18:00,358
After preparing such a feast?
You must be tired.

197
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,450
I have a study date.

198
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:02,442
With Daniel?

199
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:04,102
Yes

200
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,327
Daniel Cain?

201
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,586
Uh huh.

202
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,623
Herbert West has moved
in with him, hasn't he?

203
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,300
For the time being.

204
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,810
(doorbell)
Oh, that must be him. Excuse me.

205
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:22,459
So...your daughter
is seeing Cain, eh?

206
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:26,593
You think that's wise, Alan?

207
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:29,927
- Dan!
- Hello, Sir.

208
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:31,770
Dr Hill.

209
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:33,392
Would you join us
for a glass of wine?

210
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,687
Actually, we have some
work to do.

211
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,233
Why don't you study here?

212
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:42,402
I'll have her home soon,
don't worry about it.

213
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:46,620
Well then...
one last toast.

214
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:50,538
To Meg...

215
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:53,209
...my esteemed colleague's

216
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,710
capable, beautiful

217
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,004
loving daughter...

218
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:01,602
...the obsession of all who
fall under her spell.

219
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,525
Dan...

220
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,564
No.

221
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,113
Please!

222
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,119
- Okay, what is it?
- I don't know, it's...

223
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,622
Look - it's not you, really, it's...

224
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,376
...just a lot of little things.
- Like what?

225
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,876
Well - West is always in his
room with the door closed.

226
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,345
I mean, do you ever see him?
Does he ever eat?

227
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,641
I told you - he's a little cracked!

228
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,768
He bothers you, too.

229
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,599
No, don't be ridiculous.

230
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,075
Rufus is terrified of him.

231
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,802
When West comes in,
he runs and hides!

232
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:56,983
Rufus runs and hides all the time.
It's standard cat activity.

233
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,470
But not when we're together.

234
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:01,975
Then he's all over us, trying to
get your attention, and...

235
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:04,867
Where is he? I haven't
seen him since we got here.

236
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:06,197
It's okay - he's around here...

237
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,629
I haven't even heard him.

238
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,613
Usually he at least knocks
something over when I'm here.

239
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,591
Rufus... Rufus...Rufus

240
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:22,892
Come on, you fat cat.

241
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,488
Here. Kitty.

242
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:29,229
Where are you now,
you mad animal.

243
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:33,187
Don't you try to hide from me.

244
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:35,696
Rufus

245
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:37,097
Where are you, boy?

246
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:38,622
Here, Kitty!

247
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,652
Here, Kitty!

248
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,510
Rufus! Hey Boy!

249
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:06,436
Rufus?

250
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,233
Rufus?...Rufus?

251
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,396
Rufus?

252
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:45,229
Rufus, are you in here?

253
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:51,096
Here, Boy!

254
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:53,926
Here, Kitty.

255
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,542
Rufus?

256
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,551
Oh, Dan, I think it's...

257
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:21,436
What are you doing in my room?
How dare you come in my room!

258
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,940
Dan! Dan!

259
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,018
What's the matter?

260
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:27,689
I thought I was renting
a private room, Dan!

261
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:29,529
Meg, what the hell are
you doing here?

262
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:31,067
Would you please leave - now?!

263
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,432
Easy, Herbert!
Come on.

264
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:34,566
In the fridge!

265
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,661
I was going to show you.

266
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:48,997
Shut up.

267
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:55,219
What happened?

268
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,008
It was dead when I found it.

269
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,896
You killed him.
He hated you!

270
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,400
It suffocated.

271
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:12,074
It knocked the garbage over
and got its head stuck in a jar.

272
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,887
You weren't home, so I
put it in there.

273
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,550
I didn't think you would want
to find it like that.

274
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,555
I did not want to
stink the place up.

275
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,082
I was going to show you.

276
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:21,912
You couldn't call or
write a note?

277
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:25,379
I was busy pushing bodies around -
and what would a note say, Dan:

278
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,007
"Cat Dead - Details Later"?
I knew you were fond of it.

279
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,177
You killed him! I know
you did! He killed him!

280
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:33,200
Besides, I do not like
people in my room!

281
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,555
Alright, that's enough.

282
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:44,312
I think you'd both
better leave - now!

283
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:46,437
- What the hell is this?
- That is none of your business!

284
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:47,485
Yeah, I think it is!

285
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:48,948
Just as it is none
of my business that

286
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,700
you're sleeping with
Dean Halsey's daughter!

287
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:55,739
You know, I would not
want to see a fellow student,

288
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:58,785
especially one as promising as
yourself, be thrown out of school -

289
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,664
out of the profession -
on morals grounds.

290
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,590
Well, I think Dr Halsey
just might understand.

291
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,392
Oh, do you?

292
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:09,344
Well, you may well
be right.

293
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,594
Are you sure you
want ot find out?

294
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:19,428
(cat screams)

295
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:26,205
(cat screams)

296
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:00,390
Herbert!

297
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,720
Herbert!

298
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:04,255
Herbert!

299
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,108
You hear that sound?!

300
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:09,909
West! West!

301
00:25:11,538 --> 00:25:13,033
West, what is that?!

302
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,078
(cat screams)

303
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:36,877
(cat screaming)

304
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:42,237
Get it off of me!!

305
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:43,651
Cain!!

306
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:48,905
Get out of here!!

307
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,917
Get it off of me!!

308
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:05,468
- What the hell is it?!
- Later! Later!

309
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:14,685
There it is!

310
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:24,086
No!

311
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780
(cat howls)

312
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,240
Look out!

313
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:31,231
There it goes!

314
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,365
(cat cries)

315
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,456
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

316
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:55,451
(cat screams)

317
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,980
How?

318
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:16,171
Look out!

319
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:30,825
It's really quite simple -

320
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,852
all life is a physical and
chemical process, correct?

321
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:36,161
It stands to reason
that if one could

322
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:37,669
find extremely fresh specimens

323
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,178
and re-charge that
chemical process -

324
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,650
Bang! - we'd have re-animation.

325
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,201
The theory is not new, West.

326
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,451
But my "re-agent" is.

327
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,659
Read!

328
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,375
"With various animating solutions

329
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,094
"I have killed and brought to
animated life a number of

330
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,466
"rabbits and pigs -
cats and dogs."

331
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,551
I have broken the 6 to 12
minute barrier.

332
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,551
I've conquered brain death!

333
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:10,729
"With the higher animals and the
increased strength of the solution

334
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,397
"the reaction has become
more violent

335
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,027
"and my research has
become more difficult."

336
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,647
Which is why I need
you to help me.

337
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,495
- Help you?
- You are the perfect person to assist me.

338
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:26,908
You are hard working, bright -
people respect you...

339
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,708
and you have access to
certain authorities.

340
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,538
We can defeat death!

341
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:39,216
We can achieve every doctor's
dream. You'll be famous...

342
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,513
...and live lifetimes.

343
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:44,056
You haven't done this on people?!

344
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,685
I've done all I can here.
I'll need new lab space.

345
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:56,984
You will help me?

346
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,738
- No!
- Why - because it's mad?

347
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:01,411
No - because I don't
believe you!

348
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:03,448
How can you say that?
You've seen the results!

349
00:29:03,664 --> 00:29:05,823
No! Rufus wasn't dead
to begin with.

350
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,221
You drugged him and reduced
his vital signs...

351
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,641
...you lowered his body temperature.
He couldn't have been dead!

352
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:11,996
Do you agree that he's dead now?

353
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:14,632
Do you agree that he's dead now?!

354
00:29:22,332 --> 00:29:24,097
West, no!

355
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:30,349
West, stop!

356
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:31,939
I'll show you.

357
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:33,496
Then you'll help me.

358
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,823
- No!
- Yes, you will.

359
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,750
That is why I brought the infernal
beast back to life in the first place.

360
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:47,126
- The brain?
- Of course.

361
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:54,127
Don't expect it to tango -
it has a broken back.

362
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,762
(cat crying)
God!

363
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,310
Why does it make that noise?

364
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:06,353
Birth is always painful.

365
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:14,613
- It was dead!
- Twice.

366
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,416
(Meg screams)

367
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:20,120
- It's him!
- What are you doing here?

368
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:23,036
- It's Rufus!
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

369
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,610
Oh, my God!

370
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:27,922
(cat screaming)

371
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:36,757
Herbert West has effected
re-animation in dead animal tissue!

372
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,472
Mister Cain...

373
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:44,223
...I'm surprised.
- No, I've seen it!

374
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:48,149
He brought back a dead
animal - a cat! Back to life!

375
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,270
I hadn't expected such nonsense
from you, Mr Cain,

376
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:54,277
but I should have guessed it
when you took up with Mr West.

377
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:56,117
I know he's unstable, but

378
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:59,163
I've seen the results -
so has your daughter!

379
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:02,248
What have you been doing
with my daughter?

380
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,537
She walked into an
experiment.

381
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:07,501
You've involved Megan
in your insanity?!

382
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:09,716
I never intended to
involve her.

383
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:12,595
Tomorrow morning you will
submit to me a written apology

384
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,095
for this entire affair.

385
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:17,017
These experiments were
clearly beyond the scope

386
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:19,767
of your legitimate studies.
They have obviously interfered

387
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:21,552
with your ability to do
your classwork.

388
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:26,284
If any equipment from the
hospital or the laboratories of

389
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:28,611
Miskatonic University were
involved in any of this

390
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:31,699
unauthorized activity, criminal
charges may be pressed!

391
00:31:31,908 --> 00:31:36,408
You will in any case, have
your student loan recinded!

392
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:38,827
My loan?

393
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,877
I won't be able to
continue school.

394
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:46,560
As for Mr West, he need submit
no apology - you may tell him

395
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,177
that he may continue with his
research without

396
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,065
the impediment of an education.

397
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:54,621
As of now, he is no longer
a student at this university.

398
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,308
Sir, can we please discuss this?

399
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,429
I think you're being blinded
by your emotions.

400
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:02,356
That will be all, Mr Cain.

401
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:13,824
Don't take this out on Meg.

402
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:15,867
She tried to stop me.

403
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:18,867
I said that will be all.

404
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,469
- They just keep on coming, don't they?
- Oh, yeah.

405
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:49,156
You ain't got my lunch
under there, have ya?

406
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,489
Yeah - one meatball
run over by a semi.

407
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:53,650
Eeew!

408
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,759
I lost my appetite. You gonna
be around for a while?

409
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,781
- Yeah.
- I might go get me some coffee.

410
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:00,287
- Take your time.
- Got it.

411
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:10,884
Meatball?

412
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:12,641
Put your shoes on.

413
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:28,909
- If we get caught...
- What will they do...

414
00:33:29,786 --> 00:33:31,280
...embalm us?

415
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,201
Let's go.

416
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:53,638
"Burn victim."

417
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,984
Here's your meatball.

418
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:08,068
"Shotgun wound to the head."

419
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:12,116
Oh, God - he's rotten!

420
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:17,329
- "Malpractice."
- Shit!

421
00:34:18,127 --> 00:34:19,877
Let's go - we're not
going to find anything!

422
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,707
Wait!...Wait!

423
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,423
Yes, I think you.

424
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,215
How long?

425
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,846
He arrived early
this evening.

426
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:36,389
"John Doe" - apparently
just dropped dead.

427
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,728
No record of any damage.
Almost perfect!

428
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,937
- Why almost?
- Could be heart damage.

429
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,867
- Just find another one!
- No - we do not have time!

430
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:51,576
All we need tonight, is a
specific conscious reaction!

431
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,250
He's been dead for hours.

432
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:55,658
Any evidence of re-animated
consciousness

433
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:57,658
will justify proceeding!

434
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:01,341
Start the recorder.

435
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,469
Start the damn recorder!

436
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,100
Make the entry.

437
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:12,891
October...

438
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:14,805
- Tenth.
- Tenth.

439
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:17,056
Subject: Male

440
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:18,440
Age?

441
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:20,987
Age: early twenties.

442
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:24,781
- Physical condition?
- No deformities.

443
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,619
Appears to have been in
excellent physical condition.

444
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:34,325
Cause Of Death:

445
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:38,880
Uh - What?

446
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:43,709
- Heart failure.
- Heart failure.

447
00:35:45,914 --> 00:35:52,074
- Time: 10:33 PM.
- 10:33 PM.

448
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:56,776
Fifteen CC's.

449
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,739
Fifteen CC's of re-agent
being administered.

450
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,994
- We're getting married!
- He's mad.

451
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,500
I've seen this happen to
medical students before...

452
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,000
...good ones!

453
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,712
Doctor Harris, is Mr Cain
loose in this hospital?

454
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,047
In the morgue, I think, Doctor.

455
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,134
I specifically told Dr Riley
to suspend him

456
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,220
and take him off the floor
if he reported to work!

457
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,770
Dr Riley's been in emergency
surgery for 4 hours.

458
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,606
I haven't seen him.

459
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,278
Time elapsed?

460
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,902
Fifteen seconds.

461
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:45,618
Something should have
happened by now!

462
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:48,498
(telephone rings)

463
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:59,302
It's not working.

464
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:01,504
Let's get out of here!

465
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,726
Obviously, the human
dosage factor is unknown.

466
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:07,509
Increasing the dosage -
20 CC's of re-agent.

467
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,604
- Herbert, let's go!
- No!

468
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,140
Ohhh...

469
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:36,506
Damn!

470
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,674
Page Mr Cain and have him report
to the Level L security desk

471
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,381
and make sure that she
stays right here!

472
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,862
You can't stop me.
I followed you here

473
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,382
and I'm going to follow
you until you listen to me...

474
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:47,783
- I love him!
- You are my daughter...

475
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,759
and you will do as
you are told!

476
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,311
Sit down, Miss Halsey.

477
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,101
Mr Cain will be up soon.
You can discuss it then.

478
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:55,982
Don't blame him, Daddy!

479
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,409
We failed!

480
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,866
Come on - let's go! Somebody
could be coming any minute!

481
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,406
He failed!
Not I!

482
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,915
(paging system)
"Mr Cain - Mr Daniel Cain"

483
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,254
"Please report to the
security desk, Level L"

484
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:12,964
Oh, God!

485
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,977
Cover him up.
Let's Go.

486
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,866
- Let's Go!
- Alright!

487
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:25,301
Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhh!

488
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:38,567
Grab him!

489
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:44,527
Stop!!

490
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:50,085
He heard me!

491
00:38:59,008 --> 00:39:00,508
Cain?!

492
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:08,983
Cain, open up this door!

493
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:10,977
Help!!

494
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:14,147
Help!!

495
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,402
Is West in there with you?!

496
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,279
You're in a lot of trouble!
Both of you!!

497
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:43,009
No!!

498
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:52,109
Let go of him!

499
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:09,456
Stop!!
For God's sake, stop!!

500
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,917
Dan...

501
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,092
...look out.

502
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:31,158
Ohhh!

503
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:43,994
Come on!

504
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,163
Find the recorder!

505
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:51,095
Herbert - No!

506
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:53,645
Did you see him, Dan?
He listened to me!

507
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,856
It made a conscious act!

508
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:57,593
He heard you as an animal would!

509
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:01,098
No, no - you can't be serious!

510
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:04,100
You may be right. It had
probably been dead too long...

511
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,860
...wasn't fresh enough!

512
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:08,861
We probably only revived
the senses and the instincts -

513
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,782
so come on!
Help me get him up.

514
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:15,080
- Is he dead?
- Of course -would you give me a hand?!

515
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,823
He interrupted an important
experiment in progress.

516
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,868
Granted, it was an accident, but
this is the freshest body

517
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,507
we could come across save of
killing one ourselves

518
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,364
and every moment that we
spend talking about it

519
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,218
costs us results!!
Now, will you give me a hand?

520
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:30,920
Dan...

521
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:33,974
...we can bring him
back to life!

522
00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:40,931
Yes

523
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,790
Now - get the recorder!

524
00:41:59,702 --> 00:42:01,457
Find my serum!

525
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,671
This is a dream.

526
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:08,419
Fiction

527
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,718
Here - get his other hand.

528
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,562
Oh, good.

529
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:18,892
Unbreakable plastic...

530
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:22,647
...one of Man's few durable
inventions.

531
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:26,654
Certainly more durable
than this.

532
00:42:27,576 --> 00:42:29,450
We need you in the
crash room.

533
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,493
Coming.

534
00:43:02,328 --> 00:43:04,652
Twelve CC's being
administered...

535
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:08,866
...the dosage lessened in accordance
with the freshness of the subject.

536
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:24,251
Five seconds.

537
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,590
Come on!

538
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:32,347
I'll show you.

539
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:37,472
Fifteen seconds.
I'll show you!

540
00:43:38,778 --> 00:43:41,616
Seventeen seconds!
Re-animation in 17 seconds!

541
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,455
The eyes opened!

542
00:43:42,824 --> 00:43:44,235
Dr Halsey?

543
00:43:45,076 --> 00:43:48,446
You once did me a favor by letting
me into your medical school!

544
00:43:48,664 --> 00:43:51,665
Doctor - welcome back
to life!

545
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,169
Daddy?
Dan?

546
00:44:18,571 --> 00:44:20,071
Damned bitch!

547
00:44:22,282 --> 00:44:23,646
Meg?!

548
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:31,221
Dan - what is it?
Are you alright?

549
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,249
Dan - it's trying to speak!
The recorder!

550
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:40,751
Rrrrraaaaahhhh!

551
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:43,068
No!!

552
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,093
Daddy!
Daddy don't!

553
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:47,601
No, Meg - don't go near!

554
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:50,433
What the hell happened here!
Dan, you alright?

555
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,179
Who's that?

556
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:58,193
Uh...that is Dean Halsey.

557
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:01,732
You see, I came down here
to visit Mr Cain...

558
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,480
...who was here working

559
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:06,506
and Halsey entered, and
started ranting at us...

560
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,006
...rather irrationally.

561
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,284
No! He was just angry!

562
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,545
Daddy!

563
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:16,792
- Who's that over there?
- Uh, just a corpse.

564
00:45:17,093 --> 00:45:20,462
You see, Halsey came in and
grabbed...that thing.

565
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,180
and, well...went crazy.

566
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,636
Dean Halsey?!
Dean Halsey!

567
00:45:25,716 --> 00:45:27,108
(wails)

568
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:28,854
I'm calling the police!

569
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:30,669
Oh! Daddy!

570
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,833
(Halsey wails)

571
00:45:42,996 --> 00:45:44,496
Shock.

572
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,238
Don't worry.

573
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:04,991
(yelling)

574
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:15,024
Daddy...

575
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,359
He can't hear you, or see you.

576
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:21,119
That's a one-way mirror.

577
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:26,575
What is wrong with him, Doctor?

578
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:29,417
Will he ever be...

579
00:46:29,629 --> 00:46:32,299
Until we know exactly
what happened to him...

580
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:35,378
...there is no way to determine
his course of recovery.

581
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:40,428
That's why I need you to
sign a release

582
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,950
so I can perform
exploratory surgery on him.

583
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:47,928
Is that absolutely
necessary, Doctor Hill?

584
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:51,110
I know how difficult this
must be for you.

585
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,242
But I'm convinced your father's
problem is neurological.

586
00:46:58,536 --> 00:47:00,529
Of course, we'll take
every precaution.

587
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:06,368
You must trust me.

588
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:22,928
I want to take a look at
the right frontal lobes.

589
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,436
- I'll open the skull here...
- I...don't want to know!

590
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,854
Just help him.

591
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:53,875
Please, Doctor.

592
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:57,840
Please let me talk to him.

593
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,508
No.

594
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:04,105
I must insist you leave his
treatment up to me.

595
00:48:05,525 --> 00:48:09,855
I want you to think of me as someone
you can come to with your problems.

596
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:16,326
Or if you're ever lonely.

597
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,455
I know you're all by
yourself now.

598
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:25,864
(screams)

599
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,720
I'm going to take care
of him, Doctor.

600
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,554
And I'm going to find out
what happened to him!

601
00:49:20,635 --> 00:49:22,130
What are you doing here?

602
00:49:22,971 --> 00:49:24,430
I've been waiting for you.

603
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,141
I had to tell you about him.

604
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:31,271
What did you do to him?

605
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:36,601
What did you and
West do to him?

606
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,359
It was horrible.

607
00:49:43,493 --> 00:49:44,656
I didn't...

608
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:48,700
What did you do to him?!

609
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:57,335
He's not insane.

610
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:03,794
He's dead.

611
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:12,428
No...No!
You're insane! You're insane!

612
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:14,936
No, it's true, Meg.

613
00:50:15,653 --> 00:50:18,632
- It's true.
- No!

614
00:50:23,495 --> 00:50:24,574
Daddy!

615
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:36,083
I'm telling you, Meg.
Everything.

616
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:49,766
Good evening, Mr West.

617
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:57,030
What do you want?

618
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:00,827
I want to know why Halsey's
heart fibrilates.

619
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:02,364
I don't have to talk to you.

620
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:03,907
Why his pulse is erratic.

621
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:05,996
I told everything I know
to the police.

622
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:08,165
Why he cries out in pain.

623
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:09,836
You can leave now, Doctor!

624
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:14,545
When we both know he is
quite dead.

625
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:24,393
Hmmm...Interesting little
laboratory you have here.

626
00:51:25,176 --> 00:51:28,265
Ah! Mr West!

627
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:30,518
I recognize this.

628
00:51:33,112 --> 00:51:34,310
What do you want?

629
00:51:34,804 --> 00:51:38,068
Yes...we are both
scientists.

630
00:51:39,118 --> 00:51:41,618
Let us get to the point.

631
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:48,042
I want your discovery...

632
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:52,588
...whatever it is that gives the
dead the appearance of life.

633
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,050
It is not the appearance of life -
it is life. This is not magic.

634
00:51:56,262 --> 00:51:59,466
As you say - I am a scientist.

635
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:02,305
I'll have you locked up
for a madman...

636
00:52:03,228 --> 00:52:05,228
...or a murderer.

637
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:14,404
You will do...

638
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:18,491
...what I tell you to do.

639
00:52:50,821 --> 00:52:53,028
Ingenious, Mr West.

640
00:52:54,492 --> 00:52:58,492
Your extention of that old fool
Gruber's work is really quite...

641
00:52:59,747 --> 00:53:02,247
...brilliant!

642
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:24,021
- Dr Hill examined your father?
- Yes.

643
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:27,729
He wanted to do exploratory
surgery on him.

644
00:53:30,906 --> 00:53:32,235
He'll find out.

645
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,616
Eventually, he'll find out.

646
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:39,746
Let us see...

647
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,208
...my new serum at work, eh?

648
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:48,298
Dead cat tissue.

649
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,180
The re-agent.

650
00:54:21,669 --> 00:54:23,669
Magnificent!

651
00:54:40,315 --> 00:54:42,936
Yes, Mr West...

652
00:54:44,078 --> 00:54:47,817
...I will be famous!

653
00:54:59,374 --> 00:55:01,128
Plagiarist!

654
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:49,415
Yes...

655
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:55,955
...parts.

656
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:00,186
I've never done whole...

657
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,517
...parts.

658
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:53,915
West...

659
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:01,800
Yes, Doctor.

660
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:04,127
It's Herbert West.

661
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:07,735
What are you thinking?
How do you feel?

662
00:57:09,017 --> 00:57:12,017
You...

663
00:57:13,293 --> 00:57:15,099
You?

664
00:57:15,455 --> 00:57:23,455
Baaaaastaaaaard!!

665
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,161
(screams)
Dan!

666
00:58:58,552 --> 00:59:01,044
My God! What has Hill
done to him?!

667
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:08,561
Looks like a laser drill.

668
00:59:11,149 --> 00:59:13,649
Your father's been
lobotomized.

669
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:03,038
My work!!

670
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:04,956
My work!!

671
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,788
- What's going on?
- My work!

672
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,164
It's all gone!

673
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:13,625
He took my serum - except for
what I have upstairs.

674
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:16,333
Who!!
What happened here!

675
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:17,467
Hill.

676
01:00:18,138 --> 01:00:20,843
Hill took my serum, my notes -
everything!

677
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:22,600
Herbert, you're insane!
What's happened here!

678
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,008
I had to kill him!!

679
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:25,766
What?

680
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,440
He's dead?

681
01:00:30,402 --> 01:00:31,902
Not anymore.

682
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:35,824
No, Herbert!
This has got to stop!!

683
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:41,033
He tried to blackmail me, Dan!
And he wanted you to disappear!!

684
01:00:54,344 --> 01:00:56,052
Oh - that's why he did it.

685
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:57,461
What - you've seen Halsey?

686
01:00:57,681 --> 01:00:59,140
He lobotomized him.

687
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,364
So he could control him
in case he ever tried

688
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,890
to talk or tell anybody
what happened!

689
01:01:02,895 --> 01:01:05,766
So he could protect
"his discovery".

690
01:01:05,982 --> 01:01:08,022
- Very clever.
- I've got to tell Meg.

691
01:01:08,776 --> 01:01:10,057
What does Meg have
to do with this?

692
01:01:10,862 --> 01:01:12,480
Hill's got this weird file on her -

693
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:15,157
full of napkins and hair
and photographs

694
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,160
I think he's projected some sort
of psychotic need on to her.

695
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,683
Yes...

696
01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:16,071
Alan...

697
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,204
Alan...

698
01:03:59,064 --> 01:04:04,094
Yes, Alan...

699
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:10,469
It's time for you

700
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:17,106
to come out...now!

701
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:49,388
Is that you, Dr Hill?

702
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,599
(muffled)
Yes, it's me!

703
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:06,016
Break time.

704
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:29,805
(gasps)

705
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,957
That's better!

706
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:26,494
(knock)
Meg?

707
01:06:27,621 --> 01:06:28,570
It's Dan!

708
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:33,671
- I'm so afraid!
- What is it?

709
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,711
What's the matter?

710
01:06:39,718 --> 01:06:41,093
I don't know, I'm...

711
01:06:41,303 --> 01:06:43,739
...just worried about you.

712
01:06:44,723 --> 01:06:45,719
Why?

713
01:06:48,978 --> 01:06:53,145
I just feel horrible
about everything.

714
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:57,725
I guess I'm just
getting paranoid.

715
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:02,791
It's just...

716
01:07:03,243 --> 01:07:06,062
...so hard to lose you.

717
01:07:07,331 --> 01:07:09,331
You should go away.

718
01:07:12,837 --> 01:07:14,837
Transfer to another school.

719
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:18,403
Don't worry about me.

720
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:22,687
You're the one who
should get away...

721
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:26,949
...go on with your life.

722
01:07:29,981 --> 01:07:32,156
Find somebody.

723
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:35,309
I tried to hate you.

724
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:43,089
I wanted so much to hate you.

725
01:07:46,415 --> 01:07:48,991
I love you.

726
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,177
Daddy!!

727
01:07:57,694 --> 01:07:59,825
No, Daddy!!

728
01:08:03,058 --> 01:08:06,854
Oh, no!! Daddy, don't!!

729
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:10,115
No!!

730
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,615
(screams)

731
01:08:16,669 --> 01:08:24,488
(slow knock)
The door!

732
01:09:05,334 --> 01:09:11,552
Oh, yes, Alan...

733
01:09:44,086 --> 01:09:46,718
Ahhhhh!

734
01:09:54,220 --> 01:10:00,277
Dan?...Dan?...Dan?!

735
01:10:01,019 --> 01:10:02,983
Come on!

736
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:08,567
Ah, well...you'll be alright.

737
01:10:09,177 --> 01:10:10,272
Meg!

738
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:13,230
Oh, my God.
Where, Herbert!

739
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:16,689
At the hospital, I imagine.
Can you stand up?

740
01:10:16,724 --> 01:10:17,669
Let's go.

741
01:10:27,631 --> 01:10:32,191
Meg...

742
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:11,524
I've always...

743
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:17,594
...admired your beauty, My Dear.

744
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:24,299
I think I've always
loved you!

745
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:35,230
And you will love me!

746
01:11:39,918 --> 01:11:42,481
You will!

747
01:11:44,464 --> 01:11:45,875
Please!

748
01:11:46,091 --> 01:11:47,585
Please stop!

749
01:11:48,218 --> 01:11:49,677
Let me go!

750
01:11:49,887 --> 01:11:53,805
That's it, my dearest Meg...

751
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,271
...more passion!

752
01:12:00,857 --> 01:12:04,942
Yes, my love!

753
01:12:05,342 --> 01:12:07,454
I must say,
Dr Hill...

754
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:10,342
...I'm very dissapointed in you.

755
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,668
You steal the secret of
Life and Death,

756
01:12:13,703 --> 01:12:17,204
and here you are, trysting
with a bubble headed co-ed.

757
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:19,512
You're not even a
second rate scientist.

758
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,494
Ah! Mr West!

759
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:26,980
I'm actually glad to see you!

760
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:33,319
It saves me the trouble of
having to send for you!

761
01:12:33,325 --> 01:12:35,643
You'll never get credit
for my discovery.

762
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,455
Who's going to believe a
talking head?

763
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,385
Get a job in a sideshow!

764
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:46,393
Why an intelligent young man
like yourself...

765
01:12:47,074 --> 01:12:52,749
...should make such a foolish,
fatal mistake

766
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,062
of coming here to
challenge me!

767
01:12:57,534 --> 01:13:00,600
Oh...I have a plan.

768
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:05,372
So do I.

769
01:13:43,959 --> 01:13:45,631
Enough!!

770
01:13:58,109 --> 01:14:02,822
It is I who will show
you power, Mr West.

771
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:04,930
My discovery...

772
01:14:04,965 --> 01:14:07,574
...a laser surgical drill

773
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:11,651
makes possible a new
technique in lobotomy

774
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:16,889
which results in
total mastery

775
01:14:16,924 --> 01:14:19,678
of the human will!

776
01:14:19,713 --> 01:14:22,555
Re-animated subjects

777
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,743
have proven to be the best!

778
01:14:25,778 --> 01:14:29,293
They will give me power!

779
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:33,296
Undreamed of power!

780
01:14:35,511 --> 01:14:36,565
Stay behind me.

781
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:45,175
Daddy, listen to me!
It's Megan! Megan!

782
01:14:45,326 --> 01:14:47,018
Help! They'll kill her!

783
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:49,466
Then I'll give her life!

784
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:54,065
Look at me!!

785
01:15:16,371 --> 01:15:17,936
Aaahhhh!!

786
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:30,305
What the f...

787
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:48,559
Aaaaahhhhh!!

788
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:59,297
Herbert, come on!
Come on!

789
01:15:59,675 --> 01:16:01,765
Wait! We're not through here!

790
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:04,031
Meg, no!

791
01:16:04,037 --> 01:16:06,027
No! Let me go!!

792
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:08,293
Have I told you,
I have a theory?!

793
01:16:08,502 --> 01:16:11,502
Overdose!!!

794
01:17:03,644 --> 01:17:05,057
Herbert!

795
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:26,200
Look out!!

796
01:17:34,877 --> 01:17:36,144
Daddy!!

797
01:17:36,438 --> 01:17:37,938
Let's go, Meg!

798
01:17:47,086 --> 01:17:48,622
My notes!!

799
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:51,670
My notes!!

800
01:17:52,665 --> 01:17:54,942
Aaaaaagggg!

801
01:18:15,426 --> 01:18:16,672
Stop it!!

802
01:18:25,462 --> 01:18:27,274
Come on!!

803
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:09,634
Meg!

804
01:19:37,725 --> 01:19:38,917
My God, Megan!

805
01:19:38,952 --> 01:19:40,161
Take her to
Number Three!

806
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:49,376
Hurry! Hurry!

807
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:51,663
Activating.

808
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:54,006
Air on!

809
01:19:59,848 --> 01:20:00,965
Give it to me!

810
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:07,703
Okay, everybody out!

811
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,203
Clear!

812
01:20:13,653 --> 01:20:15,424
Nothing!

813
01:20:16,528 --> 01:20:18,113
Putting back air!

814
01:20:21,353 --> 01:20:22,675
The trachea's fractured.

815
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:25,803
- Pupils dialated.
- No response.

816
01:20:31,225 --> 01:20:32,487
Cain

817
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:36,681
Cain

818
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:16,508
I love you.

819
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:38,695
(Meg screams)
