1
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,714
Once, far away, light years,

2
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,967
distances beyond thought,

3
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:43,680
a great, slender ship
with a tail of fire

4
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,349
slid through the black
reaches of space.

5
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,311
On that ship was Zatine...

6
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,857
a prisoner named Zatine.

7
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:59,654
Words cannot describe
his evil, his criminality.

8
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,532
He had been captured
by Commander Yaveth,

9
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,285
after decades of search and evasion

10
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:10,498
in a blood-drenched battle that
claimed hundreds of lives.

11
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,756
But shortly thereafter,
Zatine escaped in a tiny scout craft.

12
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,133
A fantastic escape

13
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,552
from that spaceship.

14
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,681
And soon, he found a hiding place

15
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,185
on the planet Earth.

16
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:38,485
Zatine was a mutant,
his genes transformed.

17
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,405
A mutant with a primal wish to kill,

18
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,411
but evolved to new psychic
and occult powers.

19
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,540
He used these powers to
spread destruction and death.

20
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,336
In order to find and destroy Zatine,

21
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,631
Commander Yaveth tried many methods.

22
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,428
One of these methods was
an immense army of birds,

23
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,138
trained to hunt and to kill.

24
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,810
But when these birds
did discover Zatine,

25
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,396
he transformed himself into an eagle,

26
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,276
and managed to destroy them all...

27
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,363
except for three,

28
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:28,952
which survived and wounded
him fatally in the brain.

29
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,413
But Zatine, now dead,

30
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,333
lived on in another way.

31
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,755
Before he was killed,
he mated with Earth women,

32
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,424
procreating numerous children

33
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,511
and thereby transmitting his
wicked spirit and evil powers

34
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,806
through new generations.

35
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,894
Yet the struggle continued

36
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,021
and still goes on.

37
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:01,442
For Yaveth's descendants
pursued the progeny of Zatine

38
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:08,575
lest their contamination
spread through the cosmos.

39
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,318
Has it happened again?

40
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,195
Her name is Katie Collins

41
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,032
and she will be eight years old.

42
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,436
San Francisco with
the ball, and 12-zero.

43
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,167
San Francisco with the
basketball and 92 to 86.

44
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,712
They're going to Abdul, and they
converge on Abdul, in the corner,

45
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,755
and Abdul is down!

46
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,758
We are in the closing moments
of the basketball game,

47
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,012
Abdul, our star, we don't know
if it's a knee or an ankle,

48
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,015
Abdul has been a thorn in the
neck of Atlanta all night long.

49
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,402
They have a two order, what that
means, they'll have new money.

50
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,489
They have possibly some
new ball players like Abdul.

51
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,227
Both teams are right now
coming back out onto the court.

52
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,854
We're going to have a centre
court jump. Here we go.

53
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,065
By the left...

54
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,817
And he scores!

55
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,197
Woo-hoo!

56
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,213
Setting up that two-one-two offence.

57
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,882
They will try and work
the ball to the high post.

58
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,135
And they do. To Lane,
who's shot from 15...

59
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:23,352
Atlanta has scored again,
Abdul still not in the basketball game.

60
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,732
Atlanta has a chance to take
the lead. Prescott past the line...

61
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,860
And he scores!

62
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,014
We have a time out on the court.

63
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,142
We'll see if we can talk with Ray Armstead,
the owner of the Atlanta team.

64
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,185
- Ray, things are going well tonight.
- Yeah.

65
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,646
You're downplaying how
well the team is doing,

66
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,024
not only tonight,
but so far this year... why?

67
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,109
Oh, we've just got a good team.

68
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,946
Well, I'll tell you this. They have done
very well all year, and you have done well,

69
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,283
but we wanna find out what kind of
owner Ray Armstead is going to be.

70
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,120
Well, we're gonna change it from
Losersville to Atlanta again.

71
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,706
- How are you going to do that?
- With an open chequebook.

72
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,292
- How open is that going to be, Ray?
- Quite open.

73
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,419
Quite open. Where does
this money come from?

74
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,631
You do not have a sports
ownership bankroll.

75
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,174
Ray, answer me.

76
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,092
There's no answer I can
give you on that one.

77
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,679
You're going to give us an answer.
Where does the money come from?

78
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,224
You say you'll have an open chequebook,
and you say it'll be very open.

79
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,310
Where does the money come from?

80
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,020
Uh, God.

81
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,450
Now, so far, since
returning to the lineup,

82
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,870
Abdul has shown no ill
effects of that ankle injury

83
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:08,374
that sidelined him for a couple of
minutes earlier in the basketball game.

84
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:22,342
You know, that explosion,
I can't get it out of my mind.

85
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,885
Which explosion?

86
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,514
The first explosion, one ball,
or the second explosion, two ball?

87
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,893
How come you don't explode
when we're making love?

88
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,106
Where'd that come from?

89
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:41,152
Well, I'd like it better if you made
a little noise. A lot of noise.

90
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,197
- That's another one of your jokes.
- Can we talk seriously?

91
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,658
We're always talking
about talking about talking.

92
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,410
But we never talk.
Can you talk seriously?

93
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,545
No.

94
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,630
Marry me, Barbara.

95
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,934
I can't.

96
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,564
- We've got to settle this.
- It's settled.

97
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,116
I can't marry you or anyone, Raymond.

98
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,364
It's been seven years. Seven
and a half years, to be exact,

99
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,699
since my divorce.

100
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,620
He was a fine man.

101
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,248
A very fine man, and I
loved him very much.

102
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,921
- And I swore then that I'd nev...
- What's the matter with you?

103
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,507
Let us say it.

104
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,009
I'm scared, Raymond.

105
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,808
You treat me like a normal person,
and I thank you for it.

106
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,979
But I'm not a normal person.

107
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,859
There's something...

108
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,403
I can't explain it, Raymond.

109
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,366
There's something wrong inside,
something terrible.

110
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,329
You shouldn't have
pushed me this far.

111
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,455
It could mean the end of you and me.

112
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,458
But I know I have to tell you.

113
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,754
Tell me what?

114
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,297
It's Katie.

115
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,556
No, she scares me, Raymond.

116
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,686
There's something
I don't know. She's...

117
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,024
Sh... You don't know,
you can't even imagine.

118
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,609
She's my baby, my little girl, and...

119
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,988
She came out of me.
It's not her fault.

120
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,702
She...

121
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,296
Oh, I don't want any
more children, Raymond.

122
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,050
Crazy, Barbara.

123
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,408
I'll be eight in a few days, Squeaky.

124
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,578
There'll be a big party and they'll
give me a lot of presents.

125
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,707
It was right for now to
kill the set of babies.

126
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,354
Did I scare you?

127
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,299
You deserved it.
You always leave me alone.

128
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,093
And I've always got to play alone.

129
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,515
Here's my baby-sitter.

130
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,642
But one of these evenings...

131
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,728
I'm really gonna kill her.

132
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,688
She's always asleep.

133
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,689
And why aren't you asleep?

134
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,526
You don't love me, Mother.

135
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,112
I know it.

136
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,864
You leave me alone too much.

137
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,408
That's not fair.

138
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,828
I'm tired of it.

139
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,041
And this house is... too big.

140
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,505
And what do you want, honey?

141
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,049
I want a brother.

142
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,682
Have you been to the
United States before?

143
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,184
My first time.

144
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,061
What is the purpose of your trip?

145
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,605
I'm a visitor.

146
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,526
I'm a pretty bird.

147
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,277
Glad you love it. I'm taking it.

148
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,196
- Wise purchase, ma'am.
- I'm a pretty bird.

149
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,074
Ooh, hey, wait a minute.
Katie would love this.

150
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,868
- I saw it come on.
- I'm a pretty bird.

151
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,328
Gives me the scary creeps.

152
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,288
Very nice for Katie.

153
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,040
- I'll take it.
- Thank you.

154
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,335
It'll make a nice extra
birthday present for Katie.

155
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,464
- I'm a pretty bird.
- Thank you very much.

156
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,690
Come in.

157
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,410
Raymond.

158
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,788
Are you sure of what you're doing?

159
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,790
Yes. I am.

160
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,335
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

161
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,644
Come in, Raymond.

162
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,613
You're going to have a marvellous
team, Raymond. The best.

163
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,658
It's going to be very
easy for you to win now.

164
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,578
Are you pleased with what you have?
Is it what you wanted?

165
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,788
Yes, I am, of course.

166
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,707
Good.

167
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,627
We're in great danger, Raymond.

168
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,630
- The visitor?
- Katie has been designated for that.

169
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,424
Your problem is her mother.

170
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,594
Time is not on our side.

171
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,930
It's on your side.

172
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:35,144
We realise, Raymond,
that Barbara's resisting strongly.

173
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,812
That she doesn't want more children.

174
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,316
Up to this point, you have failed.

175
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,901
Barbara has refused to marry you.

176
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,738
And for us, this is a
very serious matter.

177
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,035
We've always believed that it was not
necessary for you to understand everything.

178
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:57,750
But now, we feel compelled to
reveal to you our real motive.

179
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:02,296
Raymond, I'm going to tell you
something of tremendous importance.

180
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:06,050
But I must warn you that any
mistake on your part now

181
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,552
would have appalling consequences,

182
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,264
both for you and for us.

183
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,562
Barbara is a miracle of nature.

184
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,024
She carries in her womb...

185
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,403
something which transcends
the world of everyday reality.

186
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:31,992
She is able to give birth to
children of immense powers,

187
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,578
both natural and supernatural.

188
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:38,082
She is the only woman
of this generation

189
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,918
who carries the genes...

190
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,171
of Zatine.

191
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,175
She was assigned to you...

192
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,179
so far, without success.

193
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,891
We wanna do everything in our
power to assist you, Raymond.

194
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,645
And we feel that events in the next
few days will help your mission,

195
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,023
and that you will achieve our intent.

196
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,735
But we've invested a great
deal of time and money in you.

197
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,071
And we cannot wait much longer.

198
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,616
We need another child like Katie.

199
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:18,413
Barbara must give birth
to a brother for Katie.

200
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,043
Power corrupts, Raymond.

201
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,630
And absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

202
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,218
But we must have that power.

203
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:05,002
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

204
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,381

207
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,776
Happy birthday, Katie.

208
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,612
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, darling!

209
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,906
- How beautiful you are!
- Look at the braids!

210
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,783
- I love the braids.
- Oh, how pretty.

211
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,619
- What a pretty birthday girl you are.
- Aww!

212
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,580
I'll be right back.

213
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,718
Hello, Squeaky. Do you like my party?

214
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,734
Come and open presents, Katie.

215
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,406
- Baby!
- Hey, this looks fun!

216
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,992
Presents!

217
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,368
From Mommy.

218
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,622
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, dear.

219
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,818
Oh, what to do!

220
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,213
From Grandma!

221
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,549
From Aunt Susan!

222
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,134
Happy birthday, my sweet.

223
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,763
Where's she going?

224
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,354
Wow!

225
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,984
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, look!

226
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,352
Here's the bullet,
it entered the left flank,

227
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,856
traversed posterior to the left
kidney and entered the spinal canal.

228
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,817
- Will there be paralysis?
- I'm afraid so.

229
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,363
- Permanent?
- In all probability.

230
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,703
Katie. You're doing
gymnastics beautifully.

231
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,373
That double twist of yours
was nearly perfect.

232
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,791
I'm getting better.

233
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,213
I'm getting perfect.

234
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,631
I will be perfect.

235
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,761
By the way, how's your mother, Katie?

236
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:53,558
Well, my mother didn't die, but she
just won't be able to walk any more.

237
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,937
Katie, oh, I've missed you so much.

238
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,106
- Oh, honey.
- I've missed you too.

239
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,816
Well, she's home, now, sweetheart.

240
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,818
You have to be a very
grown-up little lady now.

241
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,695
Your mommy needs all
the help she can get.

242
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,864
Oh, I'll help her.

243
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,074
Raymond and I will both help you.

244
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:55,203
Oh, well, I'm glad the two
of you get along so well.

245
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:59,290
Because it looks like the three of
us will be together for a while.

246
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:05,047
Oh, Mommy! I'm so glad!
Now we'll be a family!

247
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,887
- She had bought a musical bird.
- Uh-huh?

248
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:16,183
And that is a little,
tiny, uh.. metal bird.

249
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,018
You mean like a canary
or a parakeet or...

250
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,102
- A parrot.
- A parrot.

251
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,731
It's a winding.
And after you winding it,

252
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,024
- its music come out.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:31,657
And did you bring it home in,
what, a cage or a box?

254
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,116
It was wrapped.

255
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,578
- Wrapped? What do you mean, wrapped?
- Gift-wrapped, in a box.

256
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,663
Um...

257
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,623
How was the shooting done?

258
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,500
I... I really don't know.

259
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,085
But answer the question.

260
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,503
It happened so fast.

261
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:48,465
Tell me what happened, I mean exactly.
There was this present that was opened...

262
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:16,784
Oh, my God, what is that?

263
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,291
Oh!

264
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:28,171
Excuse me. The door was open,
so I came in. No one answered.

265
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,592
I'm... I am the new housekeeper,
uh, from the agency.

266
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,803
Uh, Jane, Jane Phillips.

267
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,432
I'm Barbara, Barbara Collins.

268
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,308
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

269
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,895
Oh, you have such a beautiful house.

270
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,940
- Thank you.
- It's exquisite.

271
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,152
What... what lovely taste!

272
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,195
I...

273
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,157
You know, I bet that you're a Libra.

274
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:59,870
- Yes.
- And your rising sign is, uh...

275
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,414
- Sagittarius...
- Sagittarius! That's right.

276
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,207
- And your moon is...
- Leo.

277
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,585
I knew it! Leo!

278
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,629
I'm a Leo too.
I knew it, I knew it.

279
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,632
You know, I hate to work
for women who are Virgos.

280
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,093
They're maniacal about neatness.

281
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,763
- Oh.
- And Capricorns.

282
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,473
Capricorns are the worst.

283
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,349
I'm a Capricorn.

284
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,209
- What are these?
- Oh, just a hobby of mine.

285
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,962
Artificial birds.
They make me feel less lonely.

286
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,340
And... I don't know,
I think they protect me.

287
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,842
Careful. Squeaky
might rip them apart.

288
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,012
And anyway, I don't like them.

289
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,723
- Mrs Collins?
- I do.

290
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,017
Well, Katie, then that's
settled, isn't it?

291
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,394
- I'm gonna miss the bus.
- Katie!

292
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,441
Don't you need this to
further your education?

293
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,570
Are you going to be
here all the time?

294
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,448
Well, for now, just days.

295
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,451
But it sort of depends
on you, doesn't it?

296
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,087
- Wait up!
- Wait up, Anthony!

297
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,589
- Come on!
- Hey, wait up!

298
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,676
Come on, Tommy!

299
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,303
Hey, wait up, Jimmy!

300
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,195
What are you bugging me for?

301
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,780
Ah. Ahem. Well, I...
I... I just, uh...

302
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,450
I wanted to talk to you, Katie.

303
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,871
I thought maybe, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to ask you a question.

304
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,833
Yeah. Isn't there something
that you'd like to say to me

305
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,752
that you haven't said before?

306
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,213
- Yeah.
- Eh? What's that?

307
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,964
Go fuck yourself.

308
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,008
Now, wait a minute here.

309
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,803
Now, that's... that's no way
for us to get started, is it?

310
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,097
Hey, look at me.

311
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,807
Now, listen, I could...

312
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:11,478
I could wait in the car, you know,
until you finish class, is that what you want?

313
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,939
I don't like you.
You're a child molester.

314
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,566
I'll bet you do dirty
things to children.

315
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,735
You know, I'm worried about you.

316
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,404
Jesus! Everybody's worried about me.

317
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,907
Susan, my Momma, Grandmomma...

318
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,992
They ought to go worry
about themselves.

319
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:30,830
Warthog, worrywart. Go and worry
about some perverts like you!

320
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,124
I'm smarter than all of you.

321
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,710
Maybe you are. Maybe you are.

322
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,172
But let me tell you what. Let me
ask you just one last question,

323
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:43,426
and then I promise I won't...
I won't ask you anything else.

324
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,973
What happened to the gift your
aunt gave you for your birthday?

325
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,018
You better write it down.

326
00:37:55,856 --> 00:38:00,693
- Right up your ass.
- Katie! Katie! Katie!

327
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,446
Katie!

328
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,872
Pat, hi.

329
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,503
I have a report on the gun.

330
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,506
A real doozy. No prints
other than the kid's.

331
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,801
No manufacturer's mark
and no serial number.

332
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,886
- Filed off, huh?
- Never on.

333
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,888
Tests showed negative.

334
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,308
Even the shell casings
are anonymous. Figure that out.

335
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,229
Listen to this.
"It is impossible to ascertain

336
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,316
"from examination of the wrapping
paper and accompanying gold seals

337
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,526
"whether the package was
opened and resealed

338
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,445
"before the child in
question received..."

339
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,572
That's shit.

340
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:54,121
You know, we need a
magician on this case.

341
00:38:55,082 --> 00:39:00,378
I want to know how that gun got in that
box and I want to know who put it there.

342
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,549
Well, that rules out the kid.

343
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,926
Where would an eight-year-old
kid get a gun?

344
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,471
And the mother swears that
gun was never in the house.

345
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,934
OK. What about the bird the
aunt said she put in the box?

346
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,603
The shooting was an accident.

347
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,814
I mean, it's gotta be some
kind of wild damn accident.

348
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,568
Yeah. But the gun in the box,
that's a... that's another matter.

349
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,280
Look, Jake, I got a hunch
that we can dig all we want,

350
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:31,034
and sooner or later, we're going
to have to just close the case.

351
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,078
What about the kid?

352
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,121
She doesn't seem shook up at all.

353
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,540
You... you'd have thought
she would have been.

354
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,376
I swear, she seemed glad it happened.

355
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,422
Yeah, that bugs me, man.

356
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,174
That really bugs me.

357
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,324
I'm a pretty bird.

358
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:22,838
I'm a pretty bird.

359
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,469
Inspector one, central despatch.

360
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,971
Inspector one, do you read me?

361
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:50,023
I'm a pretty bird.

362
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,903
I'm a pretty bird.

363
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:02,203
I'm a pretty bird.

364
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,044
I'm a pretty bird.

365
00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:15,349
I'm a pretty bird.

366
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,722
I'm a pretty bird.

367
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:26,410
I'm a pretty bird.

368
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,379
Inspector one...

369
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,067
Help us get him out of here!

370
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,236
Somebody must be hurt!

371
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,738
We can't reach him!

372
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,786
The tank's gonna blow!
We gotta get outta here!

373
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,246
Get the hell outta here!

374
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,499
- Come on, let's go!
- Let's go!

375
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,143

380
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,015

I don't do windows.

381
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,828
Oh. Jane, what do you
think of my daughter?

382
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,498
- Katie?
- Yes.

383
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,417
- You want the truth?
- Mm-hm.

384
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,421
She's bad.

385
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,506
What are you talking about?

386
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,008
Bad? She's just a little girl.

389
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,935
Mrs Collins...

390
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,105
Wh... Maybe this just
isn't the right time

391
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:20,192
to bring children into
this bad, mixed-up world.

392
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,363
Some of them... are confused.

393
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:29,109
They think that the forces of evil are
stronger than the forces of good.

394
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,072
Is that another one of your
astrological theories?

395
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:39,753
Mrs Collins, a great philosopher said
that our characters are our fate.

396
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:46,510
And some scientists now believe that
planets somehow understand this.

397
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:52,308
You be careful. You ward off
the influences of Saturn.

398
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,186
You have suffered enough.

399
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,814
You understand?

400
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,593
- Yes.
- Good evening.

401
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,721
- Can I help you?
- Uh, I'm the baby-sitter.

402
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,306
Baby-sitter?

403
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,395
- The baby-sitter.
- People are often surprised.

404
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,982
- From the agency?
- The home service.

405
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,902
- What happened to Nancy?
- I've no idea.

406
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,279
They... telephoned me and sent me.

407
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,947
Come in.

408
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,413
Excuse my surprise.
We usually get teenage girls.

409
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,749
Well, I'm definitely not that.

410
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,167
This is Katie.

411
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,298
Katie, stop playing with
the elevator. It's not a toy.

412
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,301
Mrs Collins is confined
to a wheelchair.

413
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,101
Barbara, this, believe it or not,
is the baby-sitter.

414
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,354
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

415
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,439
Jerzy Colsowicz.

416
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,568
- Please call me Jerzy.
- I'm Mrs Collins. Nice to meet you.

417
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:59,198
- Well, I'm ready.
- You look beautiful tonight, Barbara.

418
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,283
Thank you.

419
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,455
And you, young lady,
be in bed by 9:30.

420
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:10,626
Hm? Good night.

421
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,712
A strange guy.

422
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,048
He's got to be the oldest
baby-sitter I've ever seen.

423
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,509
I forgot to tell you,
James said he was coming.

424
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,678
You don't think he's
a child molester?

425
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,847
Oh! Of course not.

426
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,516
The agency screens out
their sitters very well.

427
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:29,103
What about you?
Aren't you a cripple molester?

428
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,813
Well, I would be if
you gave me a chance.

429
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,900
You know, Barbara,
tonight is a very special night.

430
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,737
- I've got a wonderful surprise for you.
- You have? What is it?

431
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:43,909
Close your eyes.

432
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:48,997
Now, try to remember...
a very deep part of you.

433
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:53,627
Another world, another time,
another existence.

434
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,255
Other beings.

435
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,340
Yes.

436
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,593
Yes.

437
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,347
Why did you come here?

438
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,560
Before we get on with the dancing, there's
one final announcement I'd like to make

439
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,020
of a more personal nature.

440
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,730
I feel that we're all one big family.

441
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:18,027
And I want you to be the first to know that
as soon as we can make the arrangements,

442
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,947
I intend to marry the lovely
Miss Barbara Collins.

443
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,541
- You wanna kill me?
- I don't want to kill you, Katie.

444
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,920
I want to take you away with
me when the time comes.

445
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,672
Only, if you refuse to go...

446
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,092
Why don't you just see if
you can do that? Right now?

447
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:45,554
When the time comes.
When my friends arrive.

448
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:49,058
- Your friends?
- Oh, very special friends.

449
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,893
You'll come with me.

450
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,395
I'm beginning to get
the hang of this.

451
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,741
I won, I won!

452
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,661
- See?
- You used your powers to make it go faster.

453
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:12,539
No. No, I didn't. I used the switch.

454
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,840
You want my advice, old man?

455
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:25,219
- Yes.
- Go back to wherever you came from.

456
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,179
This world is not for you.

457
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,765
It's not for you either, Katie.

458
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,288
Barbara, where the hell
do you think you're going?

459
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,457
Let me go! How could you
dare say a thing like that?

460
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,376
I want my freedom!

461
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,003
Freedom? You know,
you can't even walk!

462
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:24,903
I don't need anybody.
Not you or anybody.

463
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,697
Listen, Barbara.

464
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:31,618
It's not going to get any easier,
as the years go by, to find someone.

465
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,124
Then I'll grow old alone.

466
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,126
No. No, you won't.

467
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,880
I'm going to be right there with you.

468
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,968
Come here.

469
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,133
How did everything go?

470
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,553
Quite all right.

471
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,680
Katie went to bed right on time.

472
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,558
Good. How much do I owe you?

473
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:40,229
Uh... $15.

474
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,981
$5 an hour, agency charges.

475
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:47,277
She's a remarkable little girl.
You must be, uh, very proud of her.

476
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,696
Yes, I certainly am.

477
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,781
Here you are.

478
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,077
Good night.

479
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,972
"Mommy, you have to marry Raymond.

480
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,932
"You have to marry him.

481
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,976
"I don't want you to be all
alone in this house any more.

482
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,731
"You're selfish, Mommy.
I love you very much.

483
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,150
"Katie."

484
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,484
My God! What are you doing here?

485
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,486
Call for you, Mommy.

486
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,404
Aren't you gonna answer it?

487
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,906
Come on.

488
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,329
- Hello?
- Barbara?

489
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,041
Oh, it's you, Raymond.

490
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,085
- Are you alone?
- No. Katie's here with me.

491
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,796
Oh, Momma, let me say hi to Raymond.

492
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,924
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hi, Katie.

493
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,260
Yeah. Wouldn't it be great if
we were all here together?

494
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,222
You and Momma could make love
and I would have a baby brother.

495
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,350
Oh! Katie! It's getting
so out of hand.

496
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,185
That's not true, Mother.

497
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,063
Raymond, you can talk
her into it, can't you?

498
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,399
You know I love the both of you, Katie.
But let me talk to your mother now.

499
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,110
Barbara, I have some very important
business in San Francisco

500
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,738
and I have to leave first thing.

501
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,032
Please. Please.

502
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,785
Come and say goodbye
to me at the airport.

503
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:04,205
Oh, Raymond.
I feel so confused right now.

504
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,834
I'll think about it.

505
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,211
Good night.

506
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,213
Bye.

507
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,133
- Mommy?
- Hm?

508
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,427
- Did you read my note?
- Yes.

509
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,763
And I tore it up.

510
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,683
Oh, Momma. You're so beautiful.

511
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,634
Thomas.

512
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,860
Give me one more chance.

513
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,572
No.

514
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,240
It will be useless, Raymond.

515
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,784
We were wrong to leave
Barbara in your hands.

516
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,954
She's too strong for you.

517
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,415
She's refused intervention.

518
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,669
Now...

519
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,880
a more efficient method
has been chosen.

520
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:56,526
If you came to see Raymond
off, you're too late.

521
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:59,237
Why, Dr Walker!
What are you doing here?

522
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,326
I came to see my daughter off.

523
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,786
She left on the same flight.

524
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,458
Where did Katie disappear to?

525
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,294
Here. Let me help
you try and find her.

526
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:20,425
I'm pleased that we met here
by chance today, Mrs Collins.

527
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,970
You haven't been to see me
these past few weeks.

528
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,764
Well, uh...

529
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,101
It hasn't been easy, Dr Walker,

530
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,979
adjusting to this whole
new way of life.

531
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,773
That's exactly why I
wanted to see you.

532
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:40,069
- May I call you Barbara?
- Yes, of course.

533
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,667
Katie! Why do you
do things like that?

534
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:58,296
Sometimes I think it gives you some sort
of strange pleasure to see me suffer.

535
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,842
Mommy, I'm sorry. I just got lost.

536
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,886
- Katie.
- Hi.

537
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,849
Why don't you try and convince your
mother to come over to my house?

538
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,685
Let's go, Mommy!
We're always stuck at home alone.

539
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,981
Dr Walker, I promise that
we'll come another time.

540
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,275
But I'm exhausted right now,

541
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,486
and I think it would be better
if Katie and I would go home.

542
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,405
All right.

543
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,699
We'll let you off this time.

544
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,159
But we'll take a rain check, agreed?

545
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,198
Oh, shit.

546
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:12,745
What the hell is wrong with this?

547
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,801
Mommy? Are you scared?

548
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,095
No! Why should I be?

549
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:34,225
They'll probably help us.

550
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,322
Idiot!

551
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,871
- Hello, can I help you?
- Yes.

552
01:03:55,456 --> 01:04:02,045
My number is 7514197020.

553
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,548
Can you give me your name
and location, please?

554
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,675
I'm Mrs Barbara Collins. And, uh...

555
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:11,805
We're stalled on Interstate...

556
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:15,851
I mean, we're stalled on Route 28,

557
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,728
about 15 miles from Interstate 85.

558
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,565
I'll need a description
of your car, Mrs Collins.

559
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:26,236
Oh! Oh, yes, the car,
it's a blue 1978 Thunderbird.

560
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,821
Just a moment, please.

561
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:32,492
Our service truck will be
there within 30 minutes.

562
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,952
Thank you.

563
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,746
They'll be here in a half hour.

564
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:40,708
That truck scared you, didn't it?

565
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,836
No.

566
01:04:46,974 --> 01:04:49,810
Oh, my God.

567
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,774
What the hell is he doing?

568
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:00,075
Hey, man. This don't look so good.

569
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,702
Yeah, I know what you mean.

570
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,872
You know, they've got a lot of crazy
mothers running around out there.

571
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,124
I know where you're coming from.

572
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,628
Tell you what, we're going to check
this out real quick-like, first.

573
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,589
Cos I ain't about to be
gettin' my butt shot off.

574
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:19,677
Listen, Dizzy.
You take this one for yourself.

575
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,723
I've just remembered, I ain't
supposed to be working tonight.

576
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,600
I'm on unemployment.

577
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,853
Naw, man! You comin' with me.

578
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,772
Come on, get your
butt outta here, man.

579
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,899
You wanna walk or something?

580
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,574
Aw, shit.

581
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:44,535
It's some old crazy-ass
drunk woman and a kid.

582
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,624
Hey, Momma.
We're here to fix your car.

583
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:53,210
My Mommy isn't feeling very well.

584
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,374
Mrs Collins.

585
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:58,378
I'm sure you're
wondering why I'm here.

586
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,046
Uh, please hear me out.

587
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,967
I'm here to help you, Mrs Collins.

588
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,515
You've been feeling
strange lately, Barbara.

589
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,684
Confused.

590
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:18,230
This confusion has been transmitted to
you from another time, another place,

591
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,443
beyond human knowledge
and understanding.

592
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:27,573
There are forces, inhuman ones,

593
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:29,659
out of this world.

594
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,661
And they are unspeakably evil.

595
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,128
You are the key to their
power on this planet.

596
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,672
They sought to use you
once in their evil game.

597
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,925
And they succeeded.

598
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:48,344
This will not happen again.

599
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:50,805
But you must do exactly as I say.

600
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,725
Last night, you were
taken by violence.

601
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,310
You are pregnant, Barbara.

602
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:07,530
Pregnant with a child conceived
out of their hatred for this world.

603
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:11,951
This child must never
see the light of day.

604
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:27,985
Uh... Mrs Coll...

605
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,868
Mrs Collins...

606
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:51,133
<i>♪ Mammy's little baby likes

607
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:57,014
<i>♪ Mammy's little baby likes...

608
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,276
Hello, Mrs Collins.

609
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,778
We haven't seen you
around here in ages.

610
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:55,573
- Hi, Lucille.
- How you been doing?

611
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,783
Fine, thanks. Is the doctor in?

612
01:14:57,784 --> 01:14:59,827
Why, sure. I'll tell him you're here.

613
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,996
My, don't you look nice?

614
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:05,582
Doctor? Mrs Collins
is here to see you.

615
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,085
OK.

616
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,504
He'll be right out.

617
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,631
OK, Jimmy. You listen to me.

618
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:16,135
See what happens when you go playing out
there on that field without your shoes on.

619
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,970
Never again, huh?

620
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:21,432
And I'll tell you something.
As you were a real brave little guy,

621
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:25,061
I'll see if I can talk your mommy into
buying you an ice cream on the way home.

622
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:28,230
OK? How about four ice creams?

623
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,109
Excuse me, Mrs Moore. I have to
have a word with my ex-wife.

624
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,911
Hi, Barbara.

625
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,873
Hello, Sam.

626
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,583
How've you been doing?

627
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:50,169
I need to talk to you.

628
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,339
OK.

629
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,136
- Come up to my office.
- Fine.

630
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:03,140
Afraid we're a bit overcrowded here.
This is as near to an office as I get.

631
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:06,686
- What do you need to talk to me for?
- You're the only one I can trust.

632
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,272
The only one you can trust.

633
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,899
Ah, why do you trust me?

634
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,778
I'm just an overworked doctor,
sweating my guts out day and night

635
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:17,780
in this under-equipped dump.

636
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,616
Hell, you wouldn't even let
me into your fancy hospital

637
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:23,160
when I tried to visit you
after your operation.

638
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:26,956
You prefer to be surrounded by
beautiful people who take good care

639
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:29,000
- to keep their noses way up...
- Please!

640
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,752
- ...above any of the shit down here.
- Please, let me talk.

641
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:35,798
- The princess has come slumming.
- I'm here because I need help.

642
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,925
Desperately.

643
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,469
- I need help from you, Sam.
- Now, take it easy, OK?

644
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:44,307
All right? It's all gonna...
Hey, hey, hold it. I'm sorry.

645
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,267
I'm really sorry.

646
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,936
Now, what is it? Mm?

647
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,734
Let's hear what it's all about.
Come on. OK?

648
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,861
Tell me, and I promise
to do what I can.

649
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,529
- Well...
- Yes?

650
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,165
Evil people are staring at me.

651
01:17:01,566 --> 01:17:05,361
People are watching me.

652
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:11,626
There are evil people
doing things to me.

653
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,712
Now, look, honey...

654
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:19,675
Hey, Mom! Mom? Are you home?

655
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:25,556
Why are you still here?

656
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:27,600
Why, yes, I am.

657
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,269
Where's my ol' whipping boy?

658
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:36,609
You will say, "Where is my mother?"

659
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,403
Are you crazy? Where is she?

660
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:47,244
For once, once in your life,
you will be polite.

661
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,622
Now say it.

662
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,207
Say it.

663
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:56,295
Where is my mother?

664
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:58,255
What have you done with her?

665
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,841
Why, nothing.

666
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:05,471
Nothing. I've done nothing to protect
her, dear, don't be alarmed.

667
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:07,431
God damn you, you tell
me where she is or...

668
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,642
Don't you talk to me like that!

669
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,061
How dare you talk to me
or anybody else like that?

670
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:15,439
I got your number the moment
I walked into this house.

671
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,485
The moment I got here,
I recognised you for what you were.

672
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:28,535
You little monster. You see,
unfortunately, I had one of my own.

673
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:31,580
I know how to treat them.

674
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,917
So...

675
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:38,170
You be careful.

676
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,965
You watch out.

677
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,133
Or you'll be sorry.

678
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:46,620
Nowhere, if you really must
know where your mother is...

679
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:48,848
...she left a while ago.

680
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:53,352
With a very nice, elderly gentleman.

681
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,198
So, you're pregnant?

682
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:08,534
Yes.

683
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:12,496
I seem to remember you told me many
times you didn't want any more children.

684
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:16,375
I don't. But something
unbelievable happened.

685
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:19,670
It all took place
without my knowledge.

686
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,922
I can't have this baby, Sam.

687
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:24,967
- You've got to help me get rid of it.
- So you want an abortion.

688
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,802
- Yes.
- And you want me to do it.

689
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,637
Uh-huh.

690
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:31,265
- When?
- Right away.

691
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,601
You quite sure?

692
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:37,062
- Yes.
- God.

693
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:39,315
Why does everything
have to happen to you?

694
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,609
Your accident, the wheelchair.

695
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,736
Now you want an abortion.

696
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,071
The problems with Katie.

697
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:48,365
Everything began with Katie.

698
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:51,868
I've tried to ignore
the whole situation.

699
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:54,330
I pretended it didn't exist.

700
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:56,415
But that's not possible any more.

701
01:19:56,416 --> 01:20:01,169
- I know now I've got to do something.
- All right. I'll do what you want.

702
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,049
But I'm afraid the rest
will have to be up to you.

703
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,903
Hey, man, what are
you doing here, man?

704
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,266
Oh, my God!

705
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,672
Come out, you old bastard. Come out!

706
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,941
Where are you, old man?
Where are you?

707
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,443
Come out, you bastard! Come out!

708
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:19,446
Come out. Come out.

709
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:24,034
Come out!

710
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,078
Bastard. Bastard!

711
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,418
Come out!

712
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:16,855
What is that?

713
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,242
Ah! Help!

714
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:32,532
Mrs Collins.

715
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:34,659
I've been sent here to protect you.

716
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:39,914
No one... no one can
hurt you any more.

717
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:41,792
Play a game!

718
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:17,327
Well, Jane, it's... almost over.

719
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:20,497
I shall be leaving soon.

720
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,082
- With Katie?
- With Katie.

721
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:28,880
Jerzy... where do you go to?

722
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:32,050
My home, where I come from.

723
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:36,429
It's a lovely place,
beautiful and peaceful.

724
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,683
Beautiful and peaceful.

725
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:44,646
- Where would that be?
- Far away.

726
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:47,565
Beyond the imagination.

727
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:51,736
It sounds wonderful.

728
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,657
Jerzy, I'd like to go with you.

729
01:30:55,950 --> 01:31:00,536
I'm afraid no one may enter
there except the children.

730
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,125
I remember.

731
01:31:06,669 --> 01:31:08,837
But, you know, I've been
around children so long,

732
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,881
I think there's something
child-like about me.

733
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:18,054
I... I've never met a man like you.

734
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:20,098
Ever.

735
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,561
You've been of great
help to me, Jane.

736
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:29,607
Thank you.

737
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:51,838
Let me go now! No! Let me go!

738
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:53,715
No, no, no!

739
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:55,959
No, stop! No!

740
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,375
Katie is a very lonely little girl.

741
01:32:29,752 --> 01:32:33,296
She has a great need to recover
the affection she feels is lacking.

742
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:37,050
I don't think she fully realises
what happened, now or then.

743
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:39,803
I'm afraid she's going to
need extensive therapy.

744
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,513
There's no telling for how long.

745
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:44,808
Mommy? Mommy, I know you're there.

746
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:48,227
Please, don't leave me here.

747
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:53,191
I'll be good.
I'll be good, I promise!

748
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:56,402
Take me home, Mommy, please.

749
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:46,150
Katie? Katie, is that you?

750
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:48,069
Answer me.

751
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:50,530
Why are you so scared of me, Mommy?

752
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:54,367
Why did you leave me
in that terrible place?

753
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:57,203
I know I've been really bad lately.

754
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:59,372
But that's all over now.

755
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:02,625
I want to hug you, Mommy.

756
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,295
I'm sorry.

757
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:08,547
Please don't be angry any more.

758
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,759
Can I have a kiss?

759
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,055
Mommy? Can I have a kiss?

760
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:43,041
Katie!

761
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:47,128
Katie!

762
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:50,506
Aah! Stop it! Katie! Aaaah!

763
01:38:50,507 --> 01:38:53,426
Help! Aaah! Stop it!

764
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:57,347
Aaah! Katie! Aaah! Katie!

765
01:39:46,605 --> 01:39:48,814
You've ruined everything.

766
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:54,069
You refused intervention.

767
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:04,664
Katie.

768
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:24,011
No! No!

769
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:26,139
No! No!

770
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,724
No! No!

771
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:37,441
Go away! No! Aaah!

772
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:14,228
No! No! No, no!

773
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:17,189
No, no, no!

774
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:20,901
Get away from me!

775
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:25,573
Ow! Get away!

776
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:27,908
Get away!

777
01:43:56,188 --> 01:43:58,314
Aaah!

778
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:35,994
She's become just like the others.

779
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,289
She thought I wanted to kill her.

780
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:40,249
You can't kill children.

781
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,876
Only the evil part.

782
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:46,880
No, that's not war.
