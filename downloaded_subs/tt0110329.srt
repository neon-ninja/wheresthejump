1
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,091
Scream as you may,
scream as you might,

2
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:53,130
if you try to escape,
you'll be dead on this night.

3
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,182
Curse you.

4
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,501
I'd rather be dead than your slave.

5
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,338
Oh, William, foolish William.

6
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,303
Your shoes are filthy.

7
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,870
Yeah, what trick is this, now?

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,997
Don't you know what day it is?

9
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,543
It's a day like any other, since I
tried to take your damn pot of gold.

10
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,419
It's the 17th of March,

11
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,363
the feast of St-Patrick.

12
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,507
And your birthday.

13
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:32,302
Ah! 'Tis a special
birthday for a leprechaun.

14
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,429
I'm 1,000 years old.

15
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,784
Tonight, I can claim my bride.

16
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,732
Who'd marry a creature like you?

17
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,527
Wait till you gaze
upon this lovely lass.

18
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:53,824
Her lips so soft, her face
so fair, her bosom so ample.

19
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,492
She's a fit match for me.

20
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,869
And what evil trick will
you use to woo her?

21
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,037
Tis simple.

22
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,707
She sneezes once, she sneezes twice,

23
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,127
she'll be my bride when
she sneezes thrice.

24
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,920
Sneezes three times?

25
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,172
Ah! And if no one saves her soul,

26
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,427
by speaking "God bless you,"
the fair maiden is mine forever.

27
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,096
And am I to be her slave as well?

28
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,472
Oh, no.

29
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:22,748
The moment the lassie's married to me,
then you, my slave, shall be set free.

30
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,730
You'd like your freedom,
wouldn't you, William?

31
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,941
You know nothing is more
precious to me than freedom.

32
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,963
But why should I believe you?

33
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,322
By the sacred vow of the wee people.

34
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,550
When I am wed,
you'll have your freedom.

35
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,854
Ah!

36
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,487
Behold, my chosen bride.

37
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,553
May your wedding be blessed.

38
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,249
And I'd thrash any soul who
dared try and stop this union.

39
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,234
Oh, please, master, no.

40
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,402
What troubles you?

41
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,905
Is she not beautiful enough for me?

42
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,532
The girl, she's my daughter.

43
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,386
Oh, really. Then we
are to be related.

44
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,425
Please, master.

45
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,593
I swear,

46
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,222
I'll find you a score of
lasses fairer than she.

47
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,598
Oh, don't worry.

48
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,543
I'll be gentle with her
on our wedding night.

49
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:51,879
Now, just one more sneeze,
and you'll have your precious freedom.

50
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,561
God bless you, my child.

51
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,348
You pathetic fool.

52
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,600
You thought you could outsmart me,

53
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,873
the genius of Killarney.

54
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,940
A curse be placed upon your
seed when you go dead.

55
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,067
You may have saved your daughter,

56
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,486
but on my next thousandth birthday

57
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,575
I'll stalk your fairest offspring
and claim her as my bride.

58
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,599
Happy St-Patrick's Day.

59
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,901
<i>Soon.</i>

60
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,986
<i>Soon, my dear.</i>

61
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,055
<i>It's almost time.</i>

62
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,306
Trust me, this tour is incredible.

63
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,849
You won't believe your eyes.

64
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,020
It will be the most frightening
experience of your life.

65
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,272
Is it really scary?

66
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,858
Let me put it this way,
you're not pregnant are you?

67
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,777
Because our insurance won't cover us.

68
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,153
We've had our problems.

69
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,198
Heart conditions, emotionally
unstable or suggestible,

70
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,200
please stay away.

71
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,285
This is not the tour for you.

72
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,537
Let's go, this is one
of those rip-offs.

73
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,332
Sure, walk away, I understand.

74
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,543
If hearing the actual sound
of Jayne Mansfield's head

75
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,963
being severed from her body
is too intense for you,

76
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,112
well, then, you know,
more power to you.

77
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,470
Maybe you should try Disneyland.
It's probably more your speed.

78
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,055
Now, listen sport,
are you saying that...

79
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,723
I'm not saying anything.

80
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,017
This tour's too much for most people.

81
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,227
Now, if you'll excuse me.

82
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,953
You, sir.

83
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,274
Are you interested in the
uncut, uncensored truth

84
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,318
about Hollywood's dark side?

85
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,988
Hey, honey, didn't we see this the
other night on A Current Event?

86
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,197
No, sir, you did not.

87
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,409
This is the stuff the TV networks
just don't have the guts to show.

88
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,869
I wanna go and you're too scared.

89
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,247
You can just meet
me back at the hotel.

90
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,042
Step right in, madam, there's a
window seat reserved just for you.

91
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,627
I am not scared.

92
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:07,698
You can wait for her at this really cute
ice cream parlor right down the block.

93
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,009
Give me two tickets.

94
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,613
Now there's a brave man.
You won't be sorry.

95
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,433
Hey.

96
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,206
An award-winning performance.

97
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,353
Can we get away, now?

98
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,604
Bridget, I'll be just a minute,

99
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,898
let me just get these last two
suckers and I'm all yours, okay?

100
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,402
I understand. How can I compete with
Jayne Mansfield's severed head?

101
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,128
Well, you can't.

102
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,907
You folks are in luck.
We've just had two cancellations.

103
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,494
Better grab these now, our next
opening isn't until December.

104
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,704
Wow!

105
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,247
Looks like our lucky day, huh?

106
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,082
All right, sure.

107
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,126
- And there you go, okay.
- Great.

108
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,071
Down that way, right around the
back, there, yup, there you are.

109
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,548
Hop in.

110
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,676
Right into the deluxe
observation chamber.

111
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,261
Be prepared, everybody.

112
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,805
I will now summon your
guide to the dark side.

113
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,533
Mortimer, the all-knowing.

114
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,148
All loaded in.

115
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:09,069
Now it's just you, me, and a ton of hot
steel going two hundred miles an hour.

116
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,906
Cody, we're going to the go-kart
park, not the Indy 500.

117
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,657
A boy can dream, can't he?

118
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,744
I can't believe we're actually gonna
spend the afternoon together.

119
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,788
Listen, this job's important.

120
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,791
I gotta make enough money to
pay for my sister's eye operation.

121
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,959
Good plan. If only you had a sister.

122
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,128
Oh, you know me too well.

123
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,963
- Let's go nab your uncle and split.
- Okay.

124
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,780
Okay.

125
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,319
Morty!

126
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,847
Well, I'm glad to see you
guys got that cleaning lady.

127
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,699
Hey, Morty!

128
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,287
He's not under the shirts.

129
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,626
I know where he is.

130
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,777
You look like the kind of a man

131
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,656
who can recognize a great
opportunity when he sees one.

132
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,118
Now, by investing in a
Darkside Tour franchise,

133
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,371
you can turn death into dollars.

134
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:07,853
I can personally almost guarantee
you a 45% annual return.

135
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,964
How about you guarantee
you pay for that last round?

136
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,426
Frank, I am entertaining a client.

137
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,430
Sir, by being a partial franchisee,

138
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,185
you can own 5% for a mere $600.

139
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,584
What do you say? Do we have a deal?

140
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,339
Your family will thank you.

141
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,037
- What is it?
- Bad luck.

142
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,165
Come on.

143
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,251
Frank, you are a witness
to this transaction.

144
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,086
Morty, let's go, we got a full
hearse waiting, come on.

145
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,713
Well, let them wait.

146
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,591
May we have another
round, please, to welcome

147
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,970
the newest member
of the Darkside family.

148
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,931
Bridget, it is always
a delight to see you.

149
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,975
You know,

150
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,478
you are never too young
to invest in your future.

151
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,064
Morty, you've already given
me a dozen brochures.

152
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,941
I'll let you know when my
father reads them, okay?

153
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,194
She's a great kid, Cody.

154
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,468
May I have another drink, sir?

155
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,997
What the hell is that?

156
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,665
Red special rye.

157
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,168
Cola and water. You've had enough.

158
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,463
How dare you!

159
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,441
I am as dry as can be.

160
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,700
Cody? The usual?

161
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,225
Thank you.

162
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,042
This'll just take a second.

163
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,733
I'm sober.

164
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,006
I'm sober!

165
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,096
Wait. Wait.

166
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,078
Okay. Give me your comb.

167
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,164
I don't have one.
You look fine, come on.

168
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,166
It's a great day today, Cody.

169
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,545
I just sold another 5%
share in the franchise.

170
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,465
Look, Morty, we got a full
hearse waiting for the tour,

171
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,717
I even suckered two rubes
for the deluxe package.

172
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,886
- Let's go.
- Just two?

173
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,388
You're slipping, kid.

174
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,182
I was in kind of a hurry. Bridget and I
have a date to meet up with some kids

175
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,017
from school down at the go-kart park.

176
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,085
Ah, l'amour!

177
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,022
But one day you'll wake up.

178
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,110
And you'll realize there is only
one thing a woman wants.

179
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,905
She will grab your heart,
tear it outta your chest,

180
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,324
and throw it on the floor.

181
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,576
Not now, Morty, please,
they're waiting.

182
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,495
Indeed they are.

183
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:52,976
Now, where are my keys?
The dark side awaits us.

184
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,880
Where'd they put the door?

185
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,549
You can't give the tour.

186
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,051
- Why not?
- Well, because you're plastered.

187
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,262
So, what difference does that make?

188
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,389
What is rule number one?

189
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,725
I know, I know, never turn
away a paying customer.

190
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,770
I may be a little loose,
but I am not so far gone

191
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,841
that I will turn away
a packed hearse.

192
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,237
On the other hand, there's
always rule number two.

193
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,280
Which is?

194
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,349
Never kill a paying customer.

195
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,244
We may have to cancel the tour.

196
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,248
Here, give them their money back.

197
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,478
Morty, you really are plastered,
there's almost $300 here.

198
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,612
Cody, let's go!
We're already a half an hour late.

199
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,367
- Give me the keys.
- Where you going?

200
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,309
Rule number three. There's no
such thing as a refund, remember?

201
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,478
I'll give the stupid tour.

202
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,706
That's my boy.

203
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,107
Bridget.

204
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,442
You ready to go?

205
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,840
Ah, yeah.

206
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,139
What is it?

207
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,202
Well, we don't have to take
the bus to the go-kart park.

208
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,954
Marty's gonna give us
a ride in the hearse.

209
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,771
Sort of.

210
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,001
<i>Welcome, death seekers.</i>

211
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,837
<i>I am Baron Von Cody-stein,</i>

212
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,549
<i>your substitute usher
into the Darkside.</i>

213
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,220
<i>Our cruising altitude this
afternoon will be six feet under.</i>

214
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,562
<i>If there's anything we can do to
make your tour more terrifying,</i>

215
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,086
<i>please do not hesitate to scream.</i>

216
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,055
Is there gonna be a bathroom stop?

217
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,849
When are we gonna
see the death houses?

218
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,735
There's some carols in the glove box.
Give me number fifteen?

219
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,763
From this cliff high
above the Pacific Ocean,

220
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,582
lies the death site of...

221
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,687
You gave me the wrong card.

222
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,585
Oh, did I?

223
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,379
Here you go.

224
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,698
My husband is sick but he ain't dead!

225
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,868
Get that creepy-ass vehicle
off of my property!

226
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,845
There ain't nobody dead.

227
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,998
And stay outta this neighborhood,
don't you come back in this neighborhood

228
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,083
no more, we don't need
'em like you in here!

229
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:43,129
We are a happy family here, we don't
need you in this neighborhood!

230
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,716
<i>Uh... By the way, that was
the final resting home</i>

231
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,135
<i>of Bela Lugosi.</i>

232
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,863
Well, then, who the hell was that?

233
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,348
<i>His stepdaughter, Stella Lugosi.</i>

234
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,949
Aw!

235
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,456
I should've taken the bus.

236
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,568
Look, this is the last stop and
then we're there, okay? I promise.

237
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,738
You'll love this one,
this is my favorite.

238
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,990
<i>These ruins you see on the right</i>

239
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,286
<i>are all that remains of Harry
Houdini's once vast mansion.</i>

240
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:19,290
<i>Listen carefully and you
can hear his screams.</i>

241
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,585
<i>During his life, he could
escape from any bonds,</i>

242
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:27,089
<i>yet his spirit cannot escape
from these haunted grounds.</i>

243
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,685
Ah. Ha-ha!

244
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,421
Bah!

245
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,364
Blended Canadian?

246
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,364
The only whiskey is
Irish whiskey. Ugh!

247
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,364
Ha!

248
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,409
Is that a bit of gold I see?

249
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,910
Sit back, my friend.
You may feel some pain.

250
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,854
'Tis a pity I forgot my novocaine.

251
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,545
Ah. Ha-ha!

252
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,386
Now, rinse.

253
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,337
What the hell are we doing here?

254
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,323
Uh, bathroom stop, ten minutes.

255
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,425
Thank God!

256
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,765
Bridget, wait a second.

257
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,084
Ian.

258
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,754
Bridget, I'm glad you could make it.

259
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,005
Where is everybody?

260
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,423
They're already down at the track.

261
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,468
Did you change your hairstyle?
It looks great.

262
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,011
Thanks.

263
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,954
Bridget.

264
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,685
Can we just go outside
and talk for a second?

265
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,286
Cody.

266
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,315
Still running that classy tour, huh?

267
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,110
Come on, Bridget,
let's get down to the track.

268
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,446
I saved a special crash
helmet just for you.

269
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,697
Don't you have to work?

270
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,050
Not if you're here. I can get
someone to cover for me.

271
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,336
Hey, Billy. I gotta
take the night off.

272
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,087
Can you come down and watch the shop?

273
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,485
Listen, Bridget, I'm really sorry...

274
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,934
Oh, my God!

275
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,162
Andretti! No!

276
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:29,162
These are our friends. Now scram.

277
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,204
That's just Andretti, our guard dog.

278
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,769
Come on, let's go start our engines.

279
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,595
Bridget.

280
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,172
Just give us a second, okay?

281
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,493
What if I come by
and pick you up later?

282
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,437
It's okay, I'm sure one of the
guys can give me a ride home.

283
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,856
Wait a second.

284
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,730
Look, next time things
will be different.

285
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,646
What makes you think there's
gonna be a next time?

286
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,821
Where we going now?

287
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:08,451
This is our moment of silence for the souls
of the damned we visited on the tour.

288
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,808
You know, this tour sucks.

289
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,518
I told you this was a rip-off.

290
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,771
Yeah, he's right. Why don't you just
take us back to Broadway, okay?

291
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,314
Fine!

292
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,368
Operating a vehicle-for-hire
with only a learner's permit,

293
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,536
running a red light,

294
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,621
endangering the lives of passengers,

295
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:37,567
no insurance, and six
seatbeit violations.

296
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,129
These are serious offenses.

297
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,380
That punk.

298
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,133
When I get him home,
I'm gonna throttle him.

299
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,553
Just take it easy. I think we
gave him a pretty good scare.

300
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,140
Well, you just show me where to sign,
I'll take him off your shoulders.

301
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,268
I can only release
him to his parents.

302
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,687
Oh, his parents passed
away three years ago.

303
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,731
God rest their souls.

304
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,254
I'm his legal guardian.

305
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,047
Um, do you have a pen?

306
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,433
The kid with the hearse.

307
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,376
Sergeant...

308
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,712
You look like you're about to retire.

309
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:25,441
Have you ever thought about
investing in a franchise?

310
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,676
My pen?

311
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,278
Oh, right.

312
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,057
Well, you just keep this
and think it through.

313
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,785
Have a good night, Sergeant.

314
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,481
What did you think?

315
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,358
Did you think these guys
wouldn't catch you?

316
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,026
These are LA's finest.

317
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,527
Yeah, I guess I just wasn't thinking.

318
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,987
Damn straight!

319
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,430
Thank you, officer.

320
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,517
Why don't you take one
of these for yourself?

321
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,748
You missed your calling,
you should've been an actor.

322
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:58,832
There's no money in it.

323
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,000
How you feeling?

324
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,649
My stomach, you know.
Nothing a little Bromo won't cure.

325
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,759
No, I'm telling you, this guy came
out of a tree up at Houdini's place.

326
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,363
And he tore my gold tooth out, look.

327
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,722
Can you give a description?

328
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,934
Yeah, yeah. He was
about three feet tall,

329
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,396
had a green suit, and striped socks,
and a little hat, and a little hat.

330
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,732
And I bet he had little gold
buckles on his little black shoes.

331
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,193
Yeah! Yeah, that's right! Yes, yes!

332
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,529
Happy St-Patrick's Day, boys.

333
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,072
Get him out of here.

334
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,574
No, no, no!

335
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,327
Come on, look at me, he hurt me,
he's gonna hurt somebody else.

336
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,330
Let me go! Let me go! Listen!

337
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,417
You see that? You keep drinking,
you're gonna see little green men.

338
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,127
Don't be a wise-ass.

339
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,714
This place gives me the creeps,
let's get out of here.

340
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,841
There's gonna be blood on your
hands if you don't do something!

341
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,301
He's gonna jump
somebody else! Let me go!

342
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,700
Let me go! He's gonna
hurt somebody! He hurt me!

343
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:04,377
Spin, spin, my little guide, point
the way to my fresh young bride.

344
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,283
What is this?

345
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,993
It's a quarter.

346
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,594
What'd you expect?

347
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,457
Your gold would be nice.

348
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,183
Funny.

349
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,544
Tim Streeter, United Creative Agency.

350
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,646
Call me if you get a showcase.

351
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,065
Ah.

352
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,751
Methinks I'm going to like this town.

353
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,331
Finger-licking good.

354
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,026
<i>Kiss me.</i>

355
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,256
Bridget?

356
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,602
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

357
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,213
Thirty-one minutes! It's free!

358
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,591
Nothing tastes as
good as a free pizza.

359
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,695
Now if I could only figure
out how to get free beer.

360
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,347
Everything's a scam to you, isn't it?

361
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,791
Damn right. Come here.

362
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,644
Have some pizza.

363
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,729
No, I ain't hungry.

364
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,501
What's a matter?

365
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,234
I think I really blew
it with Bridget today.

366
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,238
She's a great girl,
how could you do such a thing?

367
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,449
Well, you got drunk,
so I decided to break our date

368
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,869
and give the stupid tour.

369
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,370
You did the right thing.

370
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,330
You went after the cash.

371
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,041
Women are trouble every time.

372
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,360
Forget her. Come on.

373
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,423
We'll play some cards.

374
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,801
Keep your eye on the red card.

375
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,261
Three Card Monte.

376
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,365
Oh. It's a perfect game.

377
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:47,227
The chump gets lured in,
he forgets everything else.

378
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:51,565
All he sees is that
money in front of him.

379
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,942
And then he gets
that look in his eye,

380
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,070
and you know he's a dead man.

381
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,889
And then it's time.
And you make your move.

382
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,454
Where you going?

383
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,557
I've been a chump,
it's time to make my move.

384
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,879
<i>So did you have a good time tonight?</i>

385
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,777
Yeah. Thanks for the ride.

386
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,136
Hey, wait up.

387
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,096
You said your parents weren't home.

388
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,473
So?

389
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,808
Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?

390
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,186
Ian, you know I'm
going out with Cody.

391
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,812
I thought you guys called it quits.

392
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,522
No, we didn't. Good night, Ian.

393
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,899
Just a second.

394
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,443
I took the whole night off for you.

395
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,904
And what about those chili dogs?

396
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,989
Ian, you better go.

397
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,742
Come on. Just a couple of minutes.

398
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,559
I said, "No."

399
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,497
I get it. You're just a tease.

400
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,066
Well, tease this.

401
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,108
Stuck-up bitch.

402
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,446
Ian?

403
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,348
- Bridget.
- Ian?

404
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:10,578
I'm so sorry. I don't
know what I was thinking.

405
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,064
What are you thinking now?

406
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:18,464
I was thinking maybe I
could make it up to you?

407
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,405
That's a start.

408
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,009
Well, are you just gonna stand there?

409
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,466
You hear that?

410
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,740
Ian, come on.

411
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,328
Why don't we go inside?
This place is giving me the creeps.

412
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,164
I may change my mind again.

413
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,057
Kiss me.

414
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,362
A vision before you.
Appears to be true.

415
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:25,869
But a leprechaun's magic
fools humans like you.

416
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,411
Was it as good for
you as it was for me?

417
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,706
You shouldn't fool with me, lass.

418
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,378
She sneezes once, she sneezes twice,

419
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,047
she'll be my bride when
she sneezes thrice.

420
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:14,676
Ian, you idiot.
You just never give up.

421
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,897
Forget it.

422
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,531
Get out of here or I'm
going to call the police.

423
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,851
You really are mad at me.

424
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,062
Trick or treat.

425
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,668
Wrong holiday.

426
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,487
Got it covered. Can I come in?

427
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,989
This is a surprise.

428
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,291
I was a real jerk today.

429
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,585
Here. Take 'em.

430
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,064
They're beautiful.

431
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,024
Not as beautiful as you.

432
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,297
Do you forgive me?

433
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,837
- Cody.
- Yep.

434
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,365
I can never stay mad at you.

435
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,575
I've learned my lesson.

436
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:15,145
From now on I promise nothing's
gonna come between us.

437
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,145
Let's go put these in some water.

438
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,470
Great. I buy you flowers
and you're allergic to them.

439
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,743
I'm not allergic. Come on.

440
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,602
"Cody." Man of few words.

441
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,270
I didn't know if you'd be home.

442
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,731
Didn't want you to think some
stalker was leaving you flowers.

443
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,486
Gesundheit. Maybe you should put
those in another room or something.

444
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,695
It's not the flowers.

445
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,139
But even if it was, it doesn't
matter because I love them.

446
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,844
God ble... Ahhh!

447
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,550
I've searched this fair
land far and wide.

448
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,120
At last I've got me
a leprechaun bride.

449
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,532
Who are you? How'd you get in here?

450
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,914
Cody!

451
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,292
Somebody help!

452
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,613
Somebody help!

453
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,994
Please. What do you want?

454
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:42,690
It's not a proper wedding without
a wedding ring, now, is it?

455
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,392
With this ring I thee wed.

456
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,249
I may now kiss the bride.

457
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,602
That's a good girl.

458
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,185
Ah! My gold!

459
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,602
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

460
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,330
Let's get the hell out of here.

461
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,733
- He killed Ian.
- This is crazy.

462
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,817
Ahhh!

463
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,419
1,000 years ago a man stopped
me from taking my bride,

464
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,504
I'll not let it happen again.

465
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,232
Cody, please!

466
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,659
Bridget!

467
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,721
<i>Bridget!</i>

468
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,848
It ain't much, but it's home.

469
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,673
What do you think of
your bridal chamber?

470
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,261
It's awful.

471
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,677
I know it lacks a woman's touch,
but you'll change that.

472
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,513
Well, shall we?

473
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,537
Oh, God, please.

474
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:49,042
Aw. Now, now, my dear, I've waited
1,000 years for this night.

475
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,418
But it was worth it.

476
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,441
Just to claim an O'Day for my bride.

477
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,949
Oh, my name's not O'Day.
You made a mistake.

478
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,344
O'Day is in your blood.

479
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,701
I can smell it.

480
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,935
I know what you need.
A little Irish whiskey.

481
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,003
Just to put you in the mood.

482
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,544
Okay.

483
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:43,242
That's the stuff.

484
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,338
Ah!

485
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,032
A little family reunion.

486
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,819
You have his cheekbones.

487
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,372
- No!
- I'm glad I have a frisky lass.

488
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,270
I like to play games too.

489
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,127
No. Please.

490
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,171
Let's play...

491
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,773
Bedtime for Bridget.

492
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:27,849
How did we get here?

493
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,999
A leprechaun's home
has many surprises.

494
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,172
That's no way to treat the
father of your children.

495
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,193
- Oh. Didn't I mention?
- No!

496
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,862
You'll be bearing my wee ones soon.

497
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,840
- Get me out of this!
- Oh, silence.

498
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,983
I'm going to have
to make a few alterations.

499
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:02,025
But afterward you should
be able to bear a full litter.

500
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,222
These will need sharpening.

501
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,932
Why?

502
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,017
Why are you doing this?

503
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,101
Aw.

504
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,103
Don't worry your
little head about it.

505
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,523
You'll get used to the pain.

506
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,626
We'll have to make some
changes to your face as well.

507
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,069
'Tis a fair face.

508
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,905
But the wee ones won't suckle
if you don't look like them.

509
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:28,180
- No!
- They can be very demanding at times.

510
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,580
Many changes.

511
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,707
Many changes.

512
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,025
No!

513
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,816
- No!
- Ah, stop that.

514
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,691
I just want to go home.

515
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,953
But you are home, my sweet.

516
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,830
And home is where you'll stay.

517
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,754
Something new, something old.

518
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:01,509
Let's be together on
leprechaun's gold.

519
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,339
It's missing.

520
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,442
A gold shilling. It's not here.

521
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,364
It's missing. I must have it back.

522
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,678
Don't leave me tied here, please.
I'll do anything.

523
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,676
I'll do...

524
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,927
I wanna make myself look
pretty for our wedding night.

525
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,767
I wanna look pretty for you.

526
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,101
You're my husband now.
I want to please you.

527
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,904
That you will.

528
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,655
Here's a proper wedding dress.

529
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,875
Be sure you're wearing
it when I return.

530
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,316
But before I go...

531
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,526
Kiss me, I'm Irish.

532
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,725
That's just a taste
of things to come.

533
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,137
Rm going to get my gold.

534
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,375
You'll try to escape,
but it's hopeless.

535
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,581
Cody?

536
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,569
I've searched this house
for my gold shilling.

537
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,423
The fool that holds
it is due for a killing.

538
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,558
Hey, Bill.

539
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,744
I think we have a suspect.

540
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,080
Found these flowers and
this note in the kitchen.

541
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,581
Cody Engels.

542
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,710
Parents told me he's the girl's boyfriend.
They said he's bad news.

543
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,814
Anyway they had some fight this afternoon
and he brought over the roses.

544
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,286
I don't know about that.

545
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,252
No, I haven't seen him.

546
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,202
- Morty?
- Jesus, kid.

547
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,245
- How did you get in here?
- Fire escape.

548
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,580
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

549
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,873
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Listen.

550
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,417
The cops are looking
for you every place.

551
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,797
They found this dead kid at Bridget's,
she's gone, everybody says you did it.

552
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,006
Me? That's crazy! I would never...

553
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,450
That's what I told the cops,
now what the hell happened?

554
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,908
A leprechaun did it.

555
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,806
- Maybe I should call the cops.
- No.

556
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,283
Wait a second. Look at this.

557
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:10,358
Okay. So you got a gold coin and it's old
and it looks like the one in this book.

558
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,278
It's probably worth some cash.
But this leprechaun story...

559
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,197
Give me that thing.

560
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,615
Cody?

561
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,368
If you were taking some dope,
you would tell me, right?

562
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,913
Morty, you gotta believe me.
I saw a real leprechaun.

563
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:27,834
You mean, like, three wishes,
and give me all your gold and like that?

564
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,211
Get out of here, kid.
That's a fairy tale.

565
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,172
This is no fairy tale.
I saw what it can do.

566
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,050
Look. Leprechauns
are devious creatures.

567
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,304
They are conniving. It says here they live
by trickery, even get pleasure out of it.

568
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,808
Maybe I should've kept you away
from all this supernatural stuff.

569
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,394
He dropped a rack of
pots on my head, Morty.

570
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,104
Oh. Now I'm convinced.

571
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,230
Look, look, look.

572
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,900
They possess telekinetic powers
and can turn invisible at will.

573
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,610
They are masters of illusion.

574
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,239
Both leprechauns and fairies can
only be harmed by wrought iron.

575
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,574
Right. Right.

576
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,826
And they're all greedy as hell,

577
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,288
and they love to drink,
and they make those shoes,

578
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,416
and they all have little pots
of gold, and if you catch them,

579
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,918
they grant you three wishes,
and all the rest of that crap.

580
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,630
Look I have read that stuff.
It's made up.

581
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,382
It's not real.

582
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,468
I use that kind of junk to
sucker in the tourists.

583
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,762
Would you listen to me please, Morty.

584
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,974
On his thousandth birthday,
the leprechaun laid claim to the lass

585
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,373
and by daybreak she was
never heard from again.

586
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,705
My God. That's why
he came for Bridget.

587
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:36,319
I should've returned this book
to the library five years ago.

588
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:40,469
I don't know what you saw,
but leprechauns don't exist.

589
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:45,936
What's that you say?
Leprechauns don't exist? Ha-ha!

590
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,439
I want my gold.

591
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,127
I'll not say it again.

592
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,962
You know what I want.

593
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,781
I'll trade you the coin for Bridget.

594
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:04,489
Ah, a fair trade, lad. Give me the
coin, and she's yours, I promise.

595
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,898
- Are you crazy?
- You can't trust a leprechaun.

596
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,733
- Did you read the book?
- Let's get out of here.

597
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,360
The place is crawling with cops.

598
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,428
All right. Fire escape.

599
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,369
Hold on a second.
My foot's caught. Ahhh!

600
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,848
Now you've done it.
You've welched on a leprechaun.

601
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,966
That is one pissed off leprechaun.
Quick! To Brennan's!

602
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,239
Great idea. It will be packed.

603
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,096
Did you see what happened
when he touched the bars?

604
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:49,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wrought iron.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

605
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,512
It's time to take a leak.

606
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,319
So how are we gonna get Bridget?

607
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,952
Let me see that coin again.

608
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,851
That son of a bitch is real.
I actually saw him.

609
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,270
- Morty!
- Sorry. Force of habit.

610
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,105
Every second we waste...

611
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,440
Who knows what he's
doing to her right now.

612
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,607
Don't worry about it, kid.

613
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:43,053
I know how much she means to you.
We're gonna catch that little bastard.

614
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,533
We're smarter. I know what I'm doing.

615
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,909
Where are you going?

616
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,931
I'm going to get a drink.

617
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,047
Yo, man! Want my gold?

618
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,926
Come on.

619
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,619
Take 'em.

620
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,641
Thanks.

621
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,936
It's real milk chocolate.

622
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,957
- Watch it, nosebleed.
- Sorry, man.

623
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,128
Morty, listen. Houdini's ruins.
Don't you remember?

624
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,423
The drunk at the police station said
a leprechaun stole his gold tooth.

625
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,634
He came out of a tree at Houdini's
ruins. That's where Bridget is.

626
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:32,471
Let's go. Morty, come on.
Let's get out of here.

627
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,016
Morty. Hello. Morty.
Come on, let's go.

628
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,038
Morty?

629
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,374
He's here.

630
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,803
Maybe we should go now.

631
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:52,140
Too late.

632
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,038
Have I mentioned that I want my gold?

633
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,373
Not until we get Bridget.

634
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:03,711
Bridget? Don't you know
she's a married woman.

635
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,565
Let me handle it. I got an idea.

636
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,484
Um.

637
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,846
Listen up, people. Listen up.

638
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:17,224
My little buddy here
just got married.

639
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:22,500
What do you say we raise our
glasses and toast his good health.

640
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:26,588
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

641
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,756
Have a drink. It's on me.

642
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,077
You got a problem?

643
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:41,040
Maybe it's just part of
that leprechaun myth

644
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,483
that they can all hold their liquor.

645
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,754
Now don't be ashamed.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

646
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:50,799
Why don't I just get you
a little green lemonade.

647
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,379
I can handle my drink.

648
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,819
Oh, really?

649
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:15,366
Frank, can I have a bottle
of that Red special rye.

650
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:19,537
I'd like to share with my little
buddy here how a real man drinks.

651
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,764
Coming right up.

652
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,877
Uh, what are you doing?

653
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,525
Watch it and learn.

654
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,147
Drink what you want,
drink what you're able,

655
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,250
if you're drinkin' with me,
you'll be under the table.

656
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,821
Come on. Let's cheer him on.
He's one of us.

657
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:58,534
One of us. One of us. One of us.
One of us. One of us.

658
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:02,204
One of us. One of us.
One of us. One of us.

659
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,749
One of us. One of us.
One of us. One of us.

660
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,545
One of us. One of us. One of us.

661
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,788
One way or another I'll find
a way out of this hell hole.

662
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:16,470
You're my hero, homie. I'm 5,000.

663
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,410
- When do we go get Bridget?
- Relax.

664
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,080
She's safe as long as he's here.

665
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,833
Pour all you want, pour all you can,

666
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,687
you won't beat me
'cause I'm a leprechaun.

667
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,839
Chaun.

668
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,263
You thought you were fast.
You thought you were sporty.

669
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:47,226
You thought you were clever,
but not as clever as Morty.

670
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,373
All right. You're done.
Now let's go get Bridget.

671
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:16,817
Didn't anybody ever tell you
not to drink and levitate?

672
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:21,785
Face it, my little friend.
You're gonna have to do what we ask.

673
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,643
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

674
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:33,122
Go get the little son of a bitch.

675
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,699
No sign of him.

676
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,993
I'm sorry I let you down, kid.

677
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,016
I had my chance and I blew it.

678
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,685
Look. Wrought iron is the one
thing that can harm him, right?

679
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,437
I got an idea.

680
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,513
Kiss this, you slimy creep.

681
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:03,136
Yeah. I have a little wedding
present for you when you get home.

682
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:25,905
Okay, pal. St. Patrick's
Day is over. Time to go home.

683
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,872
Don't be giving me any attitude,
all right? I got to close up.

684
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,245
Aye.

685
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:38,000
Very good. We have a method actor.

686
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,233
What's you next gig, huh?

687
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,461
One of Santa's elves or
one of the seven dwarfs?

688
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,448
I'm not an elf or a dwarf.

689
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,284
I'm a leprechaun.

690
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,452
Look, I don't care if you're
the Tooth Fairy, all right?

691
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,430
I just want you to pay up
so I can get out of here.

692
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:59,560
Ah. So it's my gold
you'll be wanting.

693
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:04,464
Uh, Gold Card, Visa,
MasterCard, I'd prefer cash,

694
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,757
but maybe you're a little short.

695
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,029
Boom. Gotcha.

696
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,397
One should never try to
take a leprechaun's gold.

697
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,045
You're really into this, aren't you?

698
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,069
"One should never try to
take a leprechaun's gold."

699
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,723
You kill me.

700
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,160
Huh?

701
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,370
Now there's an idea.

702
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,496
Ahhh!

703
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:49,134
Please, no!

704
00:58:58,452 --> 00:58:59,978
Don't touch. It's hot.

705
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,215
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.

706
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:12,491
Come on, Andretti. Come on.
Yeah. We're friends. Yes.

707
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,869
There you go.
Little late night snack. Yum.

708
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,537
Nice work.

709
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,415
Now are you sure that
safe is big enough?

710
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,377
Yeah. It's huge.
Big old wrought iron thing.

711
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,754
If it's a tight fit,
I ain't shedding any tears.

712
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,982
Me neither. Come on.

713
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,622
There she is.

714
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,107
These won't work.
How are we gonna open this?

715
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,004
Combination.

716
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,960
I've taught you well.

717
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,722
Yeah? I'll send you a
postcard from San Quentin.

718
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,324
Hey, give me a hand
with this stuff, will you?

719
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,016
Okay.

720
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,807
Put it back.

721
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,111
Come on.

722
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:14,428
We'll get a double hernia trying
to lift this into the hearse.

723
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:17,806
Uh. Try to find something that
builds a ramp and I will get the car.

724
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,874
Okay.

725
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,368
Ramp.

726
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,187
Security, buddy. Keep your
hands where I can see them.

727
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,023
Damn! You're breaking my arm.

728
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,150
You just tripped off a silent alarm,
buddy. You're going down.

729
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,610
Going down where?
You're a freaking security guard.

730
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,113
That's security officer, pal.

731
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,364
Any more perps around?

732
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,117
Perp? What the hell
are you talking about?

733
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,889
You're mine, tough guy.

734
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,313
Wait right here.

735
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,441
You may think this
line is getting old.

736
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,339
But believe me, son. I want my gold.

737
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,339
Look, pal. There's a big
misunderstanding here.

738
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:19,052
Now if you just un-cuff me, I can
reach my wallet. You get what I mean?

739
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,513
Are you trying to bribe me, scumbag?

740
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:25,663
I take my job seriously.
Don't try anything.

741
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,646
I've got 60 hours of combat training.

742
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,651
You should've had 65.

743
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,504
This guy's got to have a gun.

744
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,345
It's my old friend,
the drinking champ.

745
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,787
You didn't happen to see the young
lad around here now, did you?

746
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,205
No, I came here alone.

747
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,398
Wrong answer.

748
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,759
- Where is the boy?
- I don't know.

749
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,077
I'm here, shortstuff.

750
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,890
- Come and get it.
- Ah!

751
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,766
My gold.

752
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,768
The offer still stands.

753
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,770
The coin for Bridget.

754
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,397
Don't give it to him.

755
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:16,484
I'll keep what I have.
And I'll let the two of you live.

756
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,736
That's my offer.

757
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:21,010
- No deal.
- That's telling him, Cody!

758
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,534
So be it. I'll come get it myself.

759
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,631
Nice job, Cody. I'm proud of you.

760
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:38,840
Hey, you all right.

761
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,661
Well, I used to think hangovers
were bad. I just hope nothing's broken.

762
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,156
How does it feel in there, huh?

763
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:49,976
Ahhh! Let me out of here.

764
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,577
Ahhh!

765
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,358
What's the matter, Houdini?
Can't get out?

766
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,255
Let's go get Bridget.

767
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,674
Absolutely.

768
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,131
What is it?

769
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:07,244
Well, we need a ramp
to get this into the car.

770
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,870
You know what? There's some
two-by-fours in the closet.

771
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,017
Well, get 'em.

772
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,592
What the hell are you doing?

773
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,194
Morty, you locked me in.

774
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,932
It's payback time.

775
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,684
Get me out of here.

776
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:34,187
Not yet. Come on.
You know the routine.

777
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:37,524
You're caught.
You owe me three wishes.

778
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,901
Morty, we got to go get Bridget now.

779
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:43,530
I know what I'm doing.
I want my three wishes.

780
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,408
Three wishes? Morty.
No. You're screwing it all up.

781
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:49,536
Don't worry about it.
We'll all get what we want.

782
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,497
- Open this door.
- Not yet.

783
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:53,873
Not till I get my wishes.

784
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:57,377
Now, I could ask you
for a million dollars.

785
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,546
Even a billion dollars, but no.

786
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:03,842
What I think I would like
is your crummy pot of gold.

787
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,761
Morty. God! Stop it!

788
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:10,849
You hear me in there?
I want your gold.

789
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,059
Morty, don't do it.
Let me out of here.

790
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,771
Oh. It's a
greedy man I'm dealing with.

791
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,607
- Don't.
- Are you sure you want it?

792
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:23,862
Oh, I'm sure. My first
wish is for your gold.

793
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,839
So be it.

794
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,784
Where is it?

795
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,182
Oh, it's coming.

796
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,429
Get it out. Get it out of me.

797
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:53,516
Oh, God. Morty! Morty, no!

798
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:57,270
Get it out. Get it out of me.

799
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,899
I could do it, but you
have to let me out of the safe first.

800
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,942
Do you wish me out of the safe?

801
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:07,547
Yes, God damn it.
I wish you out of the safe.

802
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,493
Where the hell are you?

803
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:15,789
You'll have to open
the door. It's wrought iron, remember?

804
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,891
Didn't you read the book?

805
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,563
Stop it, Morty!

806
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,074
Morty, stop it!

807
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,297
Your second wish has been granted.

808
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,943
Get it out. Get it out!

809
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,921
Ah! You see,
you shouldn't be so greedy.

810
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,908
Get it out of me! Get it out!

811
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,244
So, uh, is that your wish?

812
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,768
Yes, yes, yes.

813
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,750
I wish you to get it out of me.

814
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,273
Very well.

815
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,438
Ahhh!

816
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,778
Morty, no!

817
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,691
A-ha!

818
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:27,168
I missed you.

819
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,810
Help me.

820
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,038
Love to, friend.
But you're all out of wishes.

821
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,263
Morty, come on, man.

822
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:56,556
Why'd you do it?

823
01:07:56,656 --> 01:08:00,035
No! No! Morty, no!

824
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,734
All right, you little bastard.
Come and get me.

825
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:11,554
Drop that weapon, psycho, and get up.

826
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,241
How many more people
have you killed tonight?

827
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,827
- What are you talking about?
- I know who you are.

828
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,705
I saw you in the news.
Whole town is looking for you.

829
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,852
Put your hands up.

830
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,726
And move out slowly.

831
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,507
Don't try anything funny.
I'm taking you in.

832
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,592
Help. Help me, please.

833
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,594
- It's a trick. Don't...
- Shut up!

834
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,096
What kind of spree are you on, sicko?

835
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,891
- No, it's the...
- I'm not afraid to use this.

836
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,601
Now take me to her now.

837
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,436
Please, help me.

838
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,313
The boy has hurt me.

839
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:47,065
We're coming, ma'am.

840
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:53,088
- Listen to me. Call for backup.
- Shut up.

841
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:55,949
Freeze!

842
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,878
What is this? Some kind of trick?

843
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,339
You'll not be taking
the boy anywhere.

844
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,466
I'll have my gold.

845
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,334
Ha! You missed me!

846
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:40,994
No!

847
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,843
I want my coin. Give it to me.

848
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,887
I'm not giving you anything
until I get Bridget.

849
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,849
You're gonna have to kill me if you
want your stinkin' piece of gold.

850
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,826
So be it.

851
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,698
I'm not dead.

852
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,642
You will be if you
don't give me my coin.

853
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,641
You can't do it, can you?

854
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,809
As long as I have this.

855
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,211
You have to give it to me.

856
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,405
You want it? Come get it.

857
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,724
I'm gonna save Bridget!

858
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,426
And then I'm gonna get you!

859
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,642
You can't hide from me!

860
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,226
I know where you live!

861
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,576
Have you had your iron today?

862
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,602
I'll be waiting.

863
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:33,581
A leprechaun's home
has many surprises.

864
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:40,262
Sweetie, still playing games?

865
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:44,008
Come out. We may be having
a house guest soon.

866
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,347
Where have you been?

867
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,101
I've been so lonely.

868
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,809
How could you leave a bride
on her wedding night?

869
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:57,296
Later, my dear. I have to
prepare for our visitor.

870
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:01,050
What visitor could be
more important than me?

871
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:05,371
After all, I thought you
waited a thousand years.

872
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,338
That I have.

873
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,585
It's been a long millennium
for the leprechaun.

874
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,400
He's had no one to
care for his needs.

875
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,985
Oh!

876
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,178
Well, that's what I'm here for.

877
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,574
To give you what you...

878
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,721
Deserve!

879
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,496
My favorite awl.

880
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:34,350
My dad gave that to me and
you've gone and broke it.

881
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,128
Now you're in for some trouble.

882
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,196
Please!

883
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:41,466
Ah.

884
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,989
Sounds like our guest has arrived.

885
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,284
Don't go anywhere.

886
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,076
Bridget?

887
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,627
Bridget?

888
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,259
Bridget?

889
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,064
Oh, God!

890
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,923
A little lost, are you?

891
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,716
What a cliché.

892
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,547
Give me the coin.

893
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,726
The coin.

894
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,071
Hand it over.

895
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,776
The coin!

896
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,662
Come on, son.

897
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:14,201
Give it to me. Get the coin.

898
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,269
I'm trying, master.

899
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,317
Bridget?

900
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,996
Where are you?

901
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:17,948
Whoa!

902
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:20,951
Ahhh!

903
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,498
Give up the coin, lad,
and I'll set you free.

904
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,342
No!

905
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,002
- Bridget!
- Cody!

906
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,587
Are you all right.
What has he done to you?

907
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,780
Surprise!

908
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,467
Don't take another step.

909
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,177
Cody, run! Get out of here.

910
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,905
- I'm not leaving without you!
- Go!

911
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,059
What will you do now, Cody?

912
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,583
You think you can beat
me here in my home?

913
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:10,759
Take your damn ring back,
I don't want it anymore.

914
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,878
Run!

915
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,244
A game of hide and seek. How lovely.

916
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,398
You know you won't get out.

917
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,146
Don't scream. He'll hear us.
Come on. We got to find a way out.

918
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:50,875
- Cody, I've tried.
- We'll do it together. Now come on.

919
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,460
That's what you think.

920
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,498
We're right back where we started.

921
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,458
There's got to be a way out of here.

922
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:09,526
Let's try this one.

923
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,345
Déjà vu.

924
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,946
Ah.

925
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:23,202
Let's try this one.

926
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,631
What are we gonna do?

927
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,133
I got an idea.

928
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,914
Bridget?

929
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:49,141
Bridget!

930
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,716
Bridget!

931
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,385
Ah! Are you all right?

932
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,554
I saw him. I saw the leprechaun.

933
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,264
- Where is he?
- He's back in the tunnels.

934
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:06,016
I managed to get away. Come on.
You're not gonna believe this.

935
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,518
But I actually found
a way out of here.

936
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,854
- Well, let's go.
- Wait. Do you still have the coin?

937
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:10,938
Yeah. Why?

938
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,440
Leave the damn thing here.
That's all he wants.

939
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,442
But, Bridget, as long as we have
the coin, he can't hurt us.

940
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,736
- We're dead without the coin.
- No. Listen to me, Cody.

941
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,573
If leaving the coin keeps
that creep from following us,

942
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,158
we've got to do it.

943
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:25,202
- But...
- No. I know it's scary.

944
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,554
It'll be okay.

945
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:33,019
Give me the coin and let's
get out of here, please.

946
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,195
I love you, Cody.

947
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,258
You lose.

948
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,606
I fooled you. Now there's
nothing to protect you.

949
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:20,090
I have the gold coin and
there's no stopping me now.

950
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,384
You can't outsmart a genius.

951
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,327
Where's Bridget?

952
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,514
Don't hurt him.

953
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:30,309
- I'll go with you.
- Yes, you will.

954
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:34,897
But first it's time to finish this
annoying boy off once and for all.

955
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,874
Like hell.

956
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:43,305
Cody! No!

957
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,932
Cody, no!

958
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,678
He's dead?

959
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,587
It's over?

960
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,860
It's really over?

961
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,552
Cry as you may. Cry as you might.

962
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:08,530
It's gonna be one hell
of a wedding night.

963
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,951
In your dreams.

964
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,707
Ahhh!

965
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,735
Real milk chocolate, genius.

966
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,336
Ahhh!

967
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,469
He's gonna blow.

968
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,809
How did you know it wasn't me
you gave the coin to before?

969
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,831
He kisses differently than you.

970
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,235
Whose kiss you like better?

971
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,903
I'll have to think about it.

972
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,675
Are you gonna keep it?

973
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,849
Trust me, it's not worth it.
