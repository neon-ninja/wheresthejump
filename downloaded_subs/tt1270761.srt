1
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,988
Mr. Blackwood?

2
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,118
Sir?

3
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,068
Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry.
You did ring, sir?

4
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,732
Come down.

5
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,409
I'm so...

6
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,245
So very sorry.

7
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,210
I didn't see the steps.

8
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,628
They made me do it.

9
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,917
I didn't...

10
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,470
If I want to see my child again,

11
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,923
I must comply.

12
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,132
Mr. Blackwood.

13
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,592
Please understand.

14
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,461
Precious teeth. Beautiful teeth.

15
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,092
Ransom for my boy.

16
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,513
Yes.

17
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,566
Daddy.

18
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,677
I brought you something more to eat.

19
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,221
Not children's teeth like you wanted,

20
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,441
but please accept them

21
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,318
in exchange for him.

22
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,147
Children's teeth.

23
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,160
Oh, no, that's the best I could do.

24
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,493
And they're my own. You see?

25
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,411
My own.

26
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,749
Please. Give me back my son!

27
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:44,254
Yes, your son is down here.
Reach for him.

28
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,885
Son? Son!

29
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,546
Son!

30
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,597
Grab my hand!

31
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,339
<i>We've now begun our descent</i>
<i>into T.F. Green Airport.</i>

32
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,546
<i>Please return to your seat,</i>
<i>make sure it is in...</i>

33
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,391
She's landed.

34
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,765
What do you think? Too much?

35
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,567
No, it's perfect. Just like you.

36
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,688
There's my girl.

37
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,815
Sally?

38
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,786
Wow! Look how tall you are!

39
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,787
What are you, 17 now?

40
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,830
Dad, you know how old I am.

41
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,283
I know. I'm being silly.

42
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,913
- Hey.
- Good morning, sir.

43
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,128
Thank you.

44
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,337
Come on.

45
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,416
Sally, this is Kim. Kim, Sally.

46
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,009
Hi, Sally. It's nice to meet you.

47
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,176
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

48
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,757
Thanks.

49
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,015
What about a picture?
You got your camera?

50
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,563
It's good to see you.

51
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,276
<i>Good morning, Rhode Island!</i>

52
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,282
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

53
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,573
<i>We've got fog this morning</i>
<i>and a slight chance of a shower later on.</i>

54
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,988
Smell that fresh air, kiddo?

55
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,955
Sure beats the smog of LA, huh?

56
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,384
I have to call Mom now.

57
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,968
Just press one and the green.

58
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:27,606
<i>Hi, you've called Joanne</i>
<i>and the magical Sally! Leave us a message.</i>

59
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,347
L.C. delivered the flooring.
If it rains, I'm afraid it's going to warp.

60
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,436
Well, just put it in the garage.

61
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,725
Sally, say hello to Mr. Harris.

62
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,855
Nice to meet you.

63
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,693
Come take a look at the house.

64
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,664
Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris,
would you give me a hand...

65
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,965
- How's it going?
- Good.

66
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,466
- When do you think you'll be finished?
- No problem.

67
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,038
Good, huh?

68
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,923
- It smells funny.
- You should have smelled it before.

69
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,966
They had moldy newspapers everywhere,

70
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,011
and dead pigeons all over the floor
and poop.

71
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,218
- Lots of it.
- It's Jacoby's office.

72
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,598
Mr. Jacoby.

73
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,554
Oh, hey, Michelle. Sorry.

74
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,396
I don't know. Hold on. I'll check.

75
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,273
You got the photographs?

76
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,085
I like to draw, too.

77
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,424
You work here?

78
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,219
No, Sally, I live here.

79
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,094
I'm the interior designer.
Do you know what that is?

80
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,104
Of course you do.

81
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,892
You see all the animal
paintings and friezes?

82
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,150
They're by Emerson Blackwood,
a man who once lived here.

83
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,240
He was a very famous wildlife painter.

84
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,947
Hey, Sally, look.

85
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,123
You want to try?

86
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,626
What do you have there?

87
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,955
- I found it.
- That's mine.

88
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,794
It was my grandmother's.
When I was little, my mother gave it to me.

89
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,130
My mom gave me to my dad.

90
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:48,969
Sally?

91
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,180
You want to see your room?

92
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,209
What do you think?

93
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,839
Kim and I worked really hard
to get it ready. Check this out.

94
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,554
It's pretty great, huh?

95
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,058
It looks better at night.

96
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,807
How long am I staying here?

97
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,776
What did your mother tell you?

98
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,031
She told me I was coming to visit.
But then she packed all my clothes.

99
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,362
She didn't explain anything to you?

100
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,161
- No.
- Sally.

101
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,913
Your mother and I are worried about you.

102
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,996
She thinks that maybe you're feeling sad

103
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:02,080
and she thought that...
Well, we thought that perhaps a change

104
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,963
might be good for you and that you could
come and live here with Kim and me

105
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,636
until we finish the work on the house
and sell it.

106
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,180
Then we could move
somewhere else and...

107
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,514
Sally? Come on. Open the door.

108
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,690
Come on. Let me in.

109
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,522
Are you going to marry her?

110
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,279
That's between Kim and me.

111
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,616
Mom said you only liked her
because she was young.

112
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,373
But she isn't. She's old.

113
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,034
Sally.

114
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,001
Open the door.

115
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,503
Come on, sweetheart. Open the door.
Sally, please, let's talk about this.

116
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,470
Look, I know...

117
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,976
I know it must be tough.

118
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:01,022
You've had a long flight,
and it's strange being in a new house.

119
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,690
I want to go to bed now.

120
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,144
Okay.

121
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,696
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

122
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,757
You'd be a terrible poker player.

123
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,848
You've been ironing that shirt
for half-an-hour.

124
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,811
She sure didn't take to me.

125
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,735
I wouldn't take it personally.
She's like that with everybody.

126
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,064
Those pills she takes, what are they?

127
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,694
Adderall, I think.

128
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,529
Jesus.

129
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,322
That's her mother for you.
That woman medicated our dogs.

130
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,328
So, what about Jacoby?

131
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,462
His assistant said he still
hasn't looked at the new photographs yet.

132
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,883
- He's had them for a week.
- I know.

133
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,302
We're still in the running,
and he's still coming to the dinner.

134
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,129
- He should just give us the cover.
- Yes, he should.

135
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,306
He gave it to the Spencer restoration
two years ago

136
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,304
and you have done miracles here.

137
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,687
We have done miracles here.
It's not all about me.

138
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,182
Thank you.

139
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,813
These are new?

140
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,103
- Yeah.
- Great.

141
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,230
If we get the cover of
<i>Architectural Digest,</i>

142
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,907
we won't need to take
out another bank loan, will we?

143
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,704
You know what your
daughter told me today?

144
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,864
What?

145
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,826
She said your wife gave her to you.

146
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,083
Kids say all kinds of
things they don't mean.

147
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,922
It couldn't have gone any worse today.

148
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,051
I feel like the evil stepmother.

149
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,642
The evil and very old stepmother.
Let's not forget the old part.

150
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,101
Because I was kind of thinking
you were looking a little ancient.

151
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,606
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,445
The stuffed bear? What was I thinking?

153
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,153
Come on. It's great. She likes it.
I saw it in her room.

154
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,575
On her bed?

155
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,703
Well, above the bed. Hanging by a noose.

156
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,868
That's okay.
Nice sign of affection, I think.

157
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:20,971
Sally. Her name is Sally.

158
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,697
Sally!

159
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,222
What do you think?

160
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,316
Yeah. Looks great.

161
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,483
- Have you seen Sally?
- Yeah, she's on the bench.

162
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,111
Sally!

163
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,397
It is not safe for you back here.

164
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,817
Hey. What's going on? Everything okay?

165
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,610
Keep her out from the back of the house.

166
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,983
She could fall in.
We'd be in a hell of a mess.

167
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,861
I didn't do anything.

168
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,698
There's pits. Old wells.
It's dangerous for a child.

169
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,781
Mr. Harris is right, Sally. He knows.
His grandfather worked at the house.

170
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,831
- You shouldn't be back here.
- But I found a basement.

171
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,375
There is no basement.

172
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,377
Easy, Harris. I'll take her. It's okay.

173
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,920
It's there! It's right there!

174
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,469
There's a reason
this house is called Fallen Mill.

175
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,176
The English had a mill here,
and it fell into a sinkhole.

176
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,762
That's why most of the houses around here
don't have basements.

177
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,017
This one does.

178
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,100
- You may want to check this out.
- It's unsafe for a child.

179
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,229
Pull on that.

180
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,108
Look! I told you it was here!

181
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,530
Can you believe this?

182
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,038
This is definitely hollow.

183
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,083
I'm going to get some tools.

184
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,542
- You sure you want to do this now?
- Of course! You kidding?

185
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,968
We can fix this easy if we have to.

186
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,171
You may want to step back.

187
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,476
Mr. Hurst, I...

188
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,662
There's a door in here.

189
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,788
Where did you put the old house keys?

190
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,667
They're in your junk drawer in the office.

191
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,834
Okay.

192
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,174
Have a look.

193
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,364
Oh, wow.

194
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,204
- You be careful, Sally. Okay?
- Okay.

195
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,581
How the hell did we miss this?

196
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,634
That must be the garden window.

197
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,313
It's all of his paints and old
color pencils. This is amazing.

198
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,665
Wow. Alex, look at this.

199
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,507
Harris, did you know about this?

200
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,466
This place isn't safe. Especially for kids.

201
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,051
It's okay. I'll keep an eye on her.

202
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,100
This must be where Blackwood worked.

203
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,397
I found another door.

204
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,730
- Look at these sketches.
- It's an ash pit, I think.

205
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,854
Yeah. It's bolted shut.

206
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,943
These are incredible.

207
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,122
Okay. Let's go, Sally.

208
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,635
Come on, Sally. Let's go.

209
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,962
Sally, come on.

210
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,137
This must be like King Tut's tomb for you.

211
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,146
Which is why we shouldn't be touching
anything. This stuff must be valuable.

212
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,558
- She's gone.
- No, she will come back.

213
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,567
They always do.

214
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,111
Yes, they always do.

215
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,021
I don't think that's important, Alan.

216
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,070
No, I just need to make sure I get
the paintings and furniture

217
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,614
back in time for the dinner.

218
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,199
You told me you could.

219
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,494
Come on.
How long have we known each other?

220
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,492
I'll write you a post-dated check.

221
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,454
Hold on.

222
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,961
It's either walnut or mahogany,
I think. Yeah.

223
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,962
There you are.
I thought maybe we could bake scones.

224
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,307
I promised Mrs. Underhill
we wouldn't make too much of a mess.

225
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,725
No. That's all right.

226
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,641
What have you got there?

227
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,729
My doll. And my drawing stuff.

228
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,535
Looks like it's just you and I
baking scones today.

229
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,911
I made sandwiches for everyone.

230
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,548
Sally, open the grate.

231
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,128
Yes, open the grate. Set us free.

232
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,643
Who are you?

233
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,271
What do you look like?

234
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,808
We've been locked up for so long.

235
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,439
Set us free.

236
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,947
Come down.
You'll see what it's like down here.

237
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,618
Wait a minute, will ya?

238
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,080
There's other children down here.
They're just like you.

239
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,374
Come and play with them.

240
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,494
Sally?

241
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,165
Sally.

242
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,961
What are you doing down here?

243
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,092
- I heard something.
- Rats, probably. It's time for dinner.

244
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,102
- It was a voice.
- Really smart rats, then.

245
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,770
No! Listen.

246
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,539
Nothing. Come on. Let's go, kiddo.

247
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,806
- I forgot my bag.
- Hurry it up, then.

248
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,053
Sally, now!

249
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,751
We can get this tomorrow. We can't
get the rest of these for two weeks.

250
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,461
What about the burnt umber?

251
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,847
It's much warmer,
and we can get it for half the price.

252
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,551
You not hungry? Sally?

253
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,771
Don't you like rice?

254
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,979
Mrs. Underhill made apple pie for dessert.

255
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,528
Apple pie has gluten, and Mommy says
gluten is bad for my concentration.

256
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,651
Oh, come on. You love apple pie.

257
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,358
We can worry
about your concentration tomorrow.

258
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,194
Mommy says no gluten.

259
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,199
What's your mother filling your head with?

260
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,781
- How about some chocolate milk?
- No.

261
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,286
- I'll make something else.
- Hold on.

262
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,289
Sally, you need to eat this,
or you can go to your room. Okay?

263
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,834
Good night, Dad.

264
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,263
What?

265
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,596
- Did that work on you when you were a kid?
- She's testing us, Kim.

266
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,349
That's what kids do.
Who's the parent here?

267
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,184
Certainly not me.

268
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,814
I didn't mean that.

269
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,897
No. You're right. I'm not a parent.

270
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,780
- We talked about this, remember?
- No, you told me about this, Alex.

271
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,113
I'm not sure
I'm ready to be anybody's mother.

272
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,699
I had a hard enough time
getting over my own childhood

273
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,575
to have to deal with somebody else's.

274
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,327
Listen, will you help me with this, please?

275
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,875
I realize this is terrible timing,
but I don't have a choice.

276
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,668
I can't just send her back.

277
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,545
That's not what I'm asking you to do.

278
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,349
Apple pie.

279
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,180
Thanks.

280
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,363
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Alex. It's Joanne.</i>

281
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,994
- Hi, Joanne.
- <i>Can I speak to Sally?</i>

282
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,620
- No, you can't.
<i>- Why not?</i>

283
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,453
Because she's asleep.
We're three hours ahead, remember?

284
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,412
What were you thinking not telling her
she was going to be living here?

285
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,215
You and I had a conversation.
I asked you if you wanted me to tell her.

286
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,716
<i>Don't do this every time I have...</i>

287
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,093
You're the one who wanted her here.

288
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,070
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

289
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,868
Did you just speak to me?

290
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,460
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

291
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,500
<i>I love you.</i>

292
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,802
<i>I love you.</i>

293
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,922
<i>I love you.</i>

294
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,058
<i>I love you.</i>

295
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,396
The light, it hurts us.

296
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,942
Yeah. Turn out the light.

297
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,992
<i>I love you.</i>

298
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,030
Turn out the light.

299
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,250
We want to be friends.

300
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,549
Where's my doll?

301
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,045
With us. Sally's doll is with us.

302
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,264
Who are you?

303
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,470
We're your friends.

304
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,021
Friends?

305
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:35,973
Where?

306
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,019
Come down to the basement
and play with us.

307
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,445
Where are you?

308
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,421
What are you?

309
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,966
Hungry.

310
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,633
Hungry.

311
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,011
Very hungry.

312
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,647
I have food.

313
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,864
Let me see you.

314
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,026
I won't hurt you, I promise.

315
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,154
Sally?

316
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,834
- What are you doing under there?
- I'm looking for my doll.

317
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,582
- Looking for what?
- I'm looking for my doll.

318
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,504
How about Teddy instead?

319
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,344
No. That's all right.

320
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,310
- Did you lose a tooth?
- That's not mine.

321
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,769
- I found it.
- You found it? Here in the house?

322
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,651
Yeah.

323
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,571
Can I call Mommy now?

324
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,074
No, it's too late. She's probably asleep.

325
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,907
I don't think you should keep this.
It's not very sanitary.

326
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,863
What about this light? Should I...

327
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,832
Leave it on, please.

328
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,326
All right, well, sleep well.

329
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,923
Sally, would you do me a favor?

330
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,294
Would you try to, maybe,
be friends with Kim?

331
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,514
- Yes.
- Thanks, kiddo.

332
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,583
Kim, have you seen my razor?

333
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,218
We have to leave in five minutes.

334
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,637
- Yeah. Have you seen my razor?
- Here, take mine.

335
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,597
Five minutes.

336
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,727
My dress.

337
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,047
Sally. I want to talk to you downstairs
right now.

338
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,637
I cannot believe you cut up Kim's clothes.

339
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,017
I didn't do it.

340
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,815
- I didn't do anything. I swear.
- Stop lying.

341
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,819
It was a horrible thing to do.
And it was dangerous.

342
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,363
You could have cut yourself.
What did you use, my razor?

343
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,031
Let me see your hands.

344
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,150
- It's mine.
- What is this?

345
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,576
Where did you get this?

346
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,408
- Let me go home.
- You can't go home.

347
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,989
Just let me go home.

348
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,917
I'm sorry about this.

349
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,000
She's never done anything like this before.
She's obviously very angry about something.

350
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,798
Alex, that is not anger. That is fear.

351
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,797
We need to go. Mrs. Underhill,

352
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,970
Kim and I have an appointment
at the historical society.

353
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,718
We'll be back this afternoon.

354
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,348
Sally, we're going out.

355
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,431
Listen to Mrs. Underhill
and do what she says.

356
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,183
And you think about
what you need to say to Kim, okay?

357
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,991
Sally.

358
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,716
Are you there?

359
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,054
Did you cut Kim's clothes?

360
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,771
Do you have my dad's razor?

361
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,067
You have to tell me the truth.

362
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,237
If you want to be friends.

363
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,624
I won't be angry.

364
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,329
Sally's not angry.

365
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,918
They're angry.

366
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,467
No, I'm not angry.

367
00:41:55,388 --> 00:42:00,098
They don't want to, but we do.

368
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,727
Come down here, Sally.

369
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,348
Come down and play.

370
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,111
You said you were hungry.

371
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,621
Do you like raisins?

372
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,871
We said we liked them.

373
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,046
See? Delicious.

374
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,933
Delicious. Yeah.

375
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,469
So delicious.

376
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,223
Did you do something bad?

377
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,102
You have to answer if
you want to be friends.

378
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,278
Yes, friend.

379
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,984
Sally?

380
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,742
What are you doing
down here in the dark?

381
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,990
Were you talking to someone?

382
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,998
Is there someone here with you?

383
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,960
No. I'm all alone.

384
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,375
There's nobody here.

385
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:24,266
Why don't you go help Mrs. Underhill
make lunch?

386
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,851
Go on. Off you go now.

387
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,105
That's right. Up those steps!
Quick as you can, now!

388
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,325
Harris. You old fool.

389
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,376
I swear. I didn't tell them anything!

390
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,366
No.

391
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,458
No, please!

392
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,198
Get away!

393
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,411
I had an accident! Call for help!

394
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,775
Don't look.

395
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,821
I could hear screams down there.

396
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,702
- Noises.
- Did you see anything?

397
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,404
He asked me to leave the cellar.

398
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,664
It was so dark in there,
he must have stumbled.

399
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,616
- Mr. Hurst, thank God!
- What happened?

400
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,543
- Are you William Harris' employer?
- Yeah.

401
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,870
There's been an accident.

402
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:45,000
- Are you okay? Where's Sally?
- I'm sorry. She saw him.

403
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,213
I tried to cover her eyes,
and I was too late.

404
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,966
- Where is she?
- She's in the garden.

405
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,471
I am sorry!

406
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,470
Sally?

407
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,574
Hi.

408
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,999
Are you scared?

409
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,754
Do you want to talk about it?

410
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,835
Is Mr. Harris going to die?

411
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,008
No, Sally.

412
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,845
He is going to be okay.

413
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,651
Can I show you something?

414
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,479
This is my favorite part of the house.

415
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,234
Blackwood loved nature.

416
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,031
He imported these fish from Japan.
And so did we.

417
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:34,992
They're called koi.

418
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,987
They're considered magical.

419
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,950
Badgers can spot them
against the mud at the bottom

420
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,538
because of their bright colors.

421
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,591
So what makes them special
is also what makes them vulnerable.

422
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,135
They have to be tough.

423
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,464
And you, too, Sally.

424
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,012
I didn't touch your clothes.

425
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,267
I swear to God, I never touched them!

426
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,780
- I didn't touch them.
- Sally.

427
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,780
I didn't! Didn't cut them, I promise.

428
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,112
I don't care about my clothes.

429
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,124
I can't really tell. 1804, I think.

430
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,627
It's hard to see.
The coin is pretty worn down.

431
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,383
She probably found it
in Blackwood's studio.

432
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,637
I don't want her
going down there anymore.

433
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,720
I'm worried about her, Kim. It's not safe.

434
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,031
- <i>This is Joanne.</i>
- Mommy?

435
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,864
<i>Oh, sweetie, it's you! How are you?</i>

436
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,990
Can I come home?

437
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,157
<i>You want to come...</i>
<i>The sashimi. Stuart, the sashimi.</i>

438
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,492
- I don't like it here.
<i>- You what?</i>

439
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,505
<i>Honey, don't fret. It's so beautiful there.</i>
<i>You just need to get used to it.</i>

440
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,173
But it's cold.

441
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,585
<i>- Honey, what?</i>
- My bed is too big.

442
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,845
<i>- Sweetheart.</i>
- And I think I'm getting sick.

443
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,638
<i>You're not getting sick.</i>

444
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:24,560
<i>It will take a little tiny bit of getting used to,</i>
<i>but you are going to be so happy there.</i>

445
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,684
<i>Okay? I promise. You'll get used to it.</i>

446
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,104
<i>I got to go, honey. Mommy's got to go.</i>

447
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,769
<i>I'll see you soon. Bye!</i>

448
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,660
Kim?

449
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,464
- Don't leave.
- What's wrong?

450
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,680
Even when I'm asleep.

451
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,560
And don't turn off the lights.

452
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,859
I'll be right here.

453
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,355
Come on.

454
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:24,986
Kim?

455
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,163
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

456
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,898
Daddy! Daddy!

457
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,192
Daddy, please!

458
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,852
Daddy!

459
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,573
Sally, what's the matter?

460
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,535
I don't want them to come anymore.

461
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,616
Who, Sally?

462
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,619
The little things.

463
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,543
They live in the basement.
They gave me the silver dollar.

464
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:09,428
They said they wanted to be my friend.
But they're horrible and mean.

465
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,888
- You just had a nightmare.
- Don't say that!

466
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,677
It's okay.

467
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,059
My bear.

468
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,107
Look what they did to my bear.

469
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:58,394
Your dad tells me art is your
favorite subject. I wish I could draw.

470
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,929
Drawing is easy.

471
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,600
The other kids can't do feet and hands.

472
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,359
When you say "the other kids,"
do you feel they're different from you?

473
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,155
My doctor back home asked me that.

474
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,949
What was your answer?

475
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,290
Okay. Let's start with something easier.

476
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,956
What's your favorite color?

477
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,129
What is that? Purple?

478
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,789
Black.

479
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:33,595
How about these little things you saw?
What do you think they are?

480
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,062
Fairies.

481
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,015
Or gnomes.

482
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,353
But scary ones?

483
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,321
And you say they know your name?

484
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,324
They talk to you?

485
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,697
Yes.

486
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,835
What do they say?

487
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,164
They want to play with me.

488
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,049
Is that all?

489
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,010
They say my parents don't love me.

490
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,558
Can I go now?

491
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,563
<i>Just a few more questions, okay?</i>

492
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:49,164
<i>There is a lot of anxiety in that little girl</i>
<i>and a deep belief that she's not wanted.</i>

493
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,883
I believe that's what's triggering
these fantastic episodes.

494
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:56,883
She told me she found a little tray filled
with teeth right inside that fireplace.

495
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:00,424
Yeah. She found a tooth,
but that doesn't mean anything, does it?

496
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:05,721
She's constructing this elaborate fantasy
about wrinkles, claws, fangs.

497
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,398
She's individuated
each one of those things,

498
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,399
her imaginary world, its inhabitants.

499
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,320
It's as detailed as any
I've ever encountered.

500
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,613
What do we do?

501
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,028
I'd like to try her on a
stronger medication, for a start.

502
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,327
I'll ask her doctor in LA to send me a copy
of her charts.

503
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,370
You call my office,
make another appointment.

504
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,446
Okay, great.

505
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,749
Meanwhile, I'll give you something
to help her sleep.

506
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,342
I'm going to be late. I can't believe it.

507
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,296
If we don't get the extension on this loan,
we're not going to get the paintings

508
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,255
or the furniture back on time.

509
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,725
We forgot the invitations
for the historical society.

510
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,179
Maybe we should just
postpone the dinner.

511
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,729
Kim, it's <i>Architectural Digest.</i>
We have to get the house on the cover.

512
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,899
- I know.
- If we don't,

513
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,694
I'm never going to get my career back,
and we're not going to sell the place.

514
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,193
- How often have we talked about this?
- What about what's been happening?

515
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,524
Harris? That was an accident.

516
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,701
- I'm talking about Sally.
- It's all in her head!

517
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,700
It's real to her.
It doesn't matter if we see it.

518
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,622
- Come on!
- Calm down!

519
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,499
I'm going to walk. It'll be faster.
I'll see you back at home.

520
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:39,652
I'm not sure how lucid he'll be.
He's pretty heavily sedated.

521
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,691
Mr. Harris, I know this is difficult,

522
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,694
but I need to understand something.

523
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,323
I need to know what Sally saw
so that I can help her.

524
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,862
Is she out of the house?

525
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:28,738
No.

526
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,368
Out.

527
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:36,372
She needs to be out of there.

528
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,753
Why?

529
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,714
Why was that room sealed up?

530
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,515
Grandfather.

531
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,723
Your grandfather closed it up?

532
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,562
- Yes.
- Why?

533
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,728
After...

534
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,730
After...

535
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,660
After what?

536
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,913
Blackwood.

537
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,871
What about Blackwood?

538
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:22,259
Lot 1134.

539
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,261
Public library.

540
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:31,559
<i>Get her out of the house.</i>

541
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,466
<i>The library will be closing in 15 minutes.</i>

542
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:07,971
<i>The library will be closing in 15 minutes.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

543
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,931
Excuse me.

544
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,894
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for the librarian.

545
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,811
Lot 1134.

546
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,987
Emerson Blackwood, Special Collections.
One sec.

547
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,244
Right this way.

548
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,433
Can't remember the last time
anyone requested these. They're beautiful.

549
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,977
I'm a designer.
I've been working at Fallen Mill.

550
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,521
Wow. Now, that's a privilege.

551
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:02,567
Personally, I think Emerson Blackwood
rivaled Audubon.

552
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,361
Come across his mural?

553
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,689
A mural? Where?

554
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,276
There in the house, supposedly.
If you do, I'd love to see it.

555
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:47,854
Hello?

556
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:11,178
Now, it's pretty ironic, really.

557
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,974
For a committed realist, someone who
insisted on drawing only from nature,

558
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,302
to do these at the end of his life.

559
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,354
I've looked at everything by Blackwood,
and I've never seen any of these.

560
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:24,183
You wouldn't.
The family made it a restricted donation.

561
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,984
- These may never be published.
- Is it possible to get copies?

562
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,442
I'll see what I can do.

563
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,070
"Wrinkles, claws, teeth?"

564
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,659
Have you ever read Machen?

565
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,786
Arthur Machen. Welsh.

566
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,955
He believed in fairy folk,

567
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:44,161
these ancient entities
from the netherworld, predating mankind.

568
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,506
Blackwood quotes him extensively.
Here, that line. There.

569
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,633
"One life must be taken."

570
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:54,171
These creatures had to take one human life
every time they emerged.

571
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,505
to replenish their ranks.

572
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,889
Many of these creatures fed on the bones,
the teeth of young children.

573
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,308
And then there's a truce, a pact of sorts,

574
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,561
between Pope Sylvester II
and these ancient beings

575
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,483
in the year 999.

576
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,985
In exchange for human teeth, they start
leaving silver pieces under the pillow.

577
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,997
Now, this is the last known drawing
by Emerson Blackwood,

578
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,667
made shortly before his disappearance
and the loss of his child.

579
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,590
His child?

580
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,922
Blackwood's only son vanished, lost.

581
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,722
Not long after, Blackwood himself
disappeared without a trace.

582
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,197
No!

583
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:40,447
No! No! Please!

584
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,005
No!

585
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,102
Sally, what's wrong?

586
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,904
Sally, open the door!

587
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,457
Oh, my God!

588
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,598
Dear, thank goodness you're home.

589
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,134
- Where is she?
- I put her to bed.

590
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,052
She wouldn't stop screaming.

591
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:00,986
Sally?

592
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,491
Kim!

593
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,660
She's not down here.

594
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,405
I think she's run away.
She's done it before.

595
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,749
Once she tried to walk all the way back
to LA from our family home in Boston.

596
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,082
I wouldn't be surprised
if that's what she's doing.

597
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,886
I went and visited Harris today.

598
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,893
Blackwood had a son. Did you know that?

599
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,225
And when he was eight, he disappeared.

600
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,185
And Blackwood vanished a few days later.

601
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,020
Why are you telling me this?

602
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,197
A lot of what Blackwood wrote
at the end of his life,

603
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:27,277
it's awfully close to Sally's story,
gnomes, creatures, all of it.

604
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,782
Kim, don't tell me you believe this.

605
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,989
Something terrible happened
in that basement.

606
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,328
- We need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

607
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,330
Put a million miles
between us and that house.

608
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,005
Every cent I have is in that house.
And you're saying that we just walk away?

609
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:42,175
I accept that
my daughter has problems, okay?

610
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,126
Thank you. We all know that.

611
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,508
But they do not involve
monsters in the basement.

612
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:48,973
There she is.

613
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,449
Come on, Sally. Get in the car.

614
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:14,282
Sally, please, just tonight,
and after the party we'll talk, okay?

615
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:44,321
Four, three, two and one.

616
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:46,981
There.

617
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,823
After the party, I will get you out of here.

618
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,659
No matter what. I promise.

619
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,167
- Sally!
- No.

620
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,626
I took it from them.

621
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,376
- You can't have this.
- They stole it. You don't understand.

622
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,712
- I need it to fight back.
- Absolutely not.

623
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:09,841
Please!

624
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,221
Nobody believes me.

625
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,930
Sally, I trust you,

626
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:23,064
and you can tell me anything at all.

627
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,233
They don't like bright lights.

628
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,823
Those things.

629
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,529
They don't?

630
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,919
Then I have a good idea.

631
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,635
Mr. Jacoby, I am so
glad you could make it.

632
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,587
- Alex, call me Charles.
- Charles.

633
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,172
- My wife, Evelyn.
- Hello, Alex.

634
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,803
It's a pleasure. Come on in.

635
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,515
The house looks absolutely fantastic.

636
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,020
You've done a remarkable job.

637
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,398
Well, thank you.

638
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,605
- We'd love the nickel tour.
- Of course. That's the whole point.

639
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,190
The foyer, obviously.

640
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,697
The mahogany, we shipped from
the very same vendor

641
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,572
that Blackwood used in London.
It's been in business since 1865.

642
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,496
You know Bill from the heritage board.

643
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:19,453
Easy, Sally. Not everybody
wants to have their photograph taken.

644
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,092
So, Alex, where's Kim?

645
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,602
I think she's still upstairs.

646
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,682
Why don't you step into the library,
grab a drink, and I'll join you in a moment.

647
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,884
Kim, hey, what's going on?

648
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,387
Her drawings.
They're exactly Blackwood's sketches.

649
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,800
Yeah, I'm sure she probably saw
your photographs and copied them.

650
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,476
No, she didn't.

651
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,645
Kim, please, Jacoby's here.

652
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,978
- Alex, this is your daughter!
- I know.

653
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,143
This is serious!

654
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,778
Just because you keep denying it
does not mean

655
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,480
- it's not happening.
- Kim, I can't do...

656
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,282
Excuse me, Mr. Hurst.
When should we serve dinner?

657
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:38,907
Ten minutes, please. Kim, everybody
is waiting. Will you come downstairs?

658
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,239
- We can talk about this later.
- No.

659
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,345
- I have proof, Dad. Look!
- Not now, honey.

660
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,842
- Please!
- Not now. Come on!

661
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,095
Welcome, everybody.

662
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,894
Please, have a seat.

663
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,563
If I could just say a few words
to all of you friends of Fallen Mill,

664
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,740
both big and small.

665
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,444
Thank you for joining us this evening.
It means a great deal to us.

666
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:24,995
Every aspect of this restoration
has followed the exact specifications

667
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:28,249
and materials used
in the original construction of the house,

668
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:32,256
including the wood assembling techniques,
the layout in the kitchen,

669
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,587
even the lacquering process
for all the timber.

670
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:38,175
It's something Kim and I are very proud of,
and I'm sure all of you,

671
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:43,343
with your vast array of expertise,
will appreciate the attention to detail.

672
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,062
The art you see on the walls, the friezes,

673
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,186
even the furniture that you're sitting on,

674
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:54,274
has all been meticulously chosen,
reassembled or restored,

675
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,401
depending on its condition,

676
01:14:56,575 --> 01:15:00,693
to, I think, truly represent the essence
of the Blackwood collection.

677
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,736
So, thank you to the heritage board

678
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,157
for their assistance,
and to the historical society,

679
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,629
and, of course, to our guest of honor,
Charles Jacoby.

680
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:17,840
Your interest in our projects is nothing
short of inspirational. So, thank you.

681
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,176
And finally, to the house itself.

682
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,342
May its newly restored life be long
and happy.

683
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,776
I guess not everybody is a fan
of tonight's menu.

684
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,426
Poor Sally. No one believes you.

685
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,633
What do you want?

686
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,465
Please just tell me what you want!

687
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,888
We want you!

688
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,770
Daddy! Daddy, please!

689
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:37,774
Daddy!

690
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,521
Sally?

691
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,860
- Daddy!
- Sally?

692
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,825
Daddy, they're in here!

693
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,083
Open the door!

694
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,176
- Charles.
- What's going on in there?

695
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,314
No! Get off of me! Stop it!

696
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,719
Sally!

697
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,188
Sally. Sally.

698
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,565
Look at me. Sally, look at me. Look at me.

699
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:08,199
Picture, I took a picture.

700
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,999
- I think we better call it a night.
- I think we should.

701
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,096
It's okay. It's okay.

702
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,786
Alex, can I talk to you?

703
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,506
I feel like I have no idea what to do.

704
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,310
I love my daughter, Kim,

705
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,736
and I love you.

706
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,653
I love you, too.

707
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,070
We should go, right?

708
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,915
- I'll get Sally ready.
- I'll get the car.

709
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,102
- Will you put this in the car?
- Yeah.

710
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,098
Kim?

711
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,010
Hi.

712
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,514
Where are we going?

713
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:50,611
We're going to go to a hotel downtown.
We're going to get you out of here.

714
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,137
Alex?

715
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:40,928
Alex?

716
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:46,642
Alex?

717
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,288
It's okay, it's okay.

718
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,565
A life will be taken.

719
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,317
One life must be taken.

720
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:46,195
A life will be taken.

721
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:48,113
One life must be taken.

722
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:56,663
Sally.

723
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,341
Sally!

724
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,341
Child's teeth!

725
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,599
Kim?

726
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:20,854
Kim?

727
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:26,697
Kim?

728
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:29,200
Daddy?

729
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:46,888
Kim?

730
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:56,647
Kim?

731
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,515
Kim!

732
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:34,052
Kim! Please.

733
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,014
Kim.

734
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:39,857
Wake up, please!

735
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,028
Wake up, Kim. Wake up, Kim.

736
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:46,364
- Wake up, Kim.
- Wake up, Kim.

737
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,907
Wake up, Kim.

738
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:13,888
The key. The key.

739
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,086
Kim, please!

740
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:43,917
Daddy! No!

741
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,505
Kim!

742
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,686
Kim, please!

743
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,135
Sally?

744
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,568
Sally? Sally!

745
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,567
Kim!

746
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,159
Let go of me!

747
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,661
Don't make me go in there!

748
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,331
Kim! Please!

749
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:21,928
Kim?

750
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:26,474
Kim?

751
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,526
- Please, Kim!
- I'm here, Sally!

752
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,284
No, please!

753
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:47,620
Sally!

754
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:54,627
Kim?

755
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,972
No! Go away!

756
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,812
Hold on! Hold on! I got you.

757
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,395
Keep them away, Sally. Use the light.
Use the light.

758
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,892
Kim!

759
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:11,979
Get him.

760
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,243
No! Please!

761
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,909
- Get away from me!
- Get off of me!

762
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,300
When I cut this rope, Sally, you run!

763
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:39,510
Please!

764
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:41,015
You run! You got that?

765
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:42,847
No, what about you?

766
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,471
- No! Please!
- Be strong.

767
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:07,367
Kim!

768
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:10,871
No!

769
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:30,556
Sally?

770
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,060
Sally?

771
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,858
Sally, are you okay? Sally.

772
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:41,526
Alex?

773
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:48,658
Kim!

774
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:53,454
Kim!

775
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,341
Kim!

776
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,267
Dad?

777
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,679
Daddy?

778
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,768
Daddy.

779
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:17,563
Please!

780
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,139
That's far enough, Sally.

781
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:21,228
I love you, Kim.

782
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:28,887
They will find us. They will find us
and hurt us. We must fight.

783
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:34,718
No, we will go deeper, and we will wait.

784
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:38,559
They will forget, and others will come.

785
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:41,273
When will they come?
When will we get them?

786
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,151
Soon, soon.

787
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,653
- We have all the time in the world.
- Yes.

788
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:54,655
All the time in the world.
