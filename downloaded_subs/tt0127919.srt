The Tale of the Mummy

3
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:18,968
Valley of the Kings, Egypt
August 15, 1948

00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:25,767
The Turkel Expedition 
Day 262

5
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:48,050
Allah Akbar

6
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:00,536
Sir richard..Sir Richard..
Allah Akbar

7
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,230
Sir Richard?

8
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,202
Come in, Nabil

9
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:11,480
- We discovered an entrance, it faces to the north.
- Are you certain of this?

10
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,180
But this is wonderful news my boy.
This is wonderful news..

11
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,470
- Do we have a name?
- No name..

12
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:23,850
I see.

13
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,343
Very well, we'll inform the others.

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,063
Here's to the lost treasures of men.

15
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:38,333
It's not about the treasure.
It's about history.

16
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:41,813
The investors don't give a whit about
history. Unless they can sell it

17
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:45,048
"Then they might be disappointed.
According to Nabil

18
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:48,270
the inscriptions make no
mention of an occupants name.

19
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:53,450
What's in a name? It what he possessed
in life that counts on the open market.

20
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:56,986
On the contrary Mr.
Young, to the ancients a

21
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,123
man's true essence is
contained in his name.

22
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:03,126
Removing that from the
entrance to the tomb..

23
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:06,874
Was considered a banishment
from the hereafter.

24
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:09,466
Surely the best people we know
are going to hell anyway.

25
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,248
There is no hell, only none-existence.

26
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,557
"Richard Turkel August fifteenth 1948"

27
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,269
Day 262

28
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:39,421
Nine months of digging and finally
an entrance has been discovered.

29
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,009
My hunch proved correct

30
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:49,048
Let along this secluded
stretch lie a series of tombs.

31
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:51,192
But who would be buried here?

32
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:53,430
A Pharaoh, I presume

33
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,685
Hidden safely from ancient thieves

34
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:00,978
Today we uncover the truth.

35
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:19,637
- I... I can't move! I'm stuck!
- Don't panic Parsons. Breath through your nose!!

36
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:24,680
Blow it out of your arse
- what? Same to ya!

37
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:42,108
The burial chamber must lie beyond.

38
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:45,210
Astonishing..

39
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,657
A virgin seal, unbroken.

40
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:52,470
- You mean no looters?
- It would appear not

41
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,875
- Lucky for us.
- Not luck, more a matter of fear.

42
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,393
It's the curse, isn't it?

43
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,264
Of course, it is a curse.

44
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,403
Well, what's it say?

45
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:12,831
Listen all who now have being avoid this
place, abandoned by all that is... holy

46
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:24,346
I who have slaughtered the innocent I who
have... confused terror with ...pleasure

47
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:37,799
Obviously lacking in self
esteem. Oh well, as long..

48
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:41,777
As he was rich, we won't
hold it against him.

49
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,399
We have a name

50
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:51,275
Talos!

51
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,317
Shall we begin?
History Beckons

52
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,170
No, no that's sacrilege! We are
archaeologists, we're not grave robbers.

53
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:14,197
Now be careful! What ever
you say "sire Richard".

54
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,916
Expect we'd be remembered more fondly
then the bloke on the other side

55
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,153
Wait!

56
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:32,717
- What the devil you suppose that was?
- I suppose it was the wind.

57
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,233
Impossible!

58
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:57,488
Get out of here!!
Save yourself!

59
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:12,340
What..is..happening...

60
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:15,546
O God!

61
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,165
Help Nabil!

62
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:23,182
Hey, pull me out. Hurry up you bastards!

63
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:28,657
Pull me up!

64
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,631
God forgive us..

65
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,237
January 1999

66
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,109
Day 262

67
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:20,775
Nine months of digging and finally an
entrance has been discovered.

68
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:22,937
But who would be buried here?

69
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:25,265
A Pharaoh, I presume.

70
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:28,049
Hidden safely from ancient thieves.

71
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:31,044
Today we uncover the truth

72
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:51,173
Digits. I see digits,
a series of numbers

73
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:54,434
four, four being
"January", four being,

74
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,672
April... April the a ..
April the twentieth

75
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:01,084
That's my granddad's birthday.
How do you do that?

76
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:07,269
Don't know. Kinda spooky really,
I just see, oh everything.

77
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,337
He obviously deduces it from
the inane series of questions

78
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:13,145
he's been asking, it is a
trick, it's a very old one.

79
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,043
Yeah, well I will give
you a hand with that...

80
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,264
Come here Miss, I'll give you a buckle.

81
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:26,124
Oké folks. The old coot finally
worked out all the glitches.

82
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:28,314
We go in one hour.

83
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:38,934
This is Operations
Control can you hear me?

84
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,920
- Professor Marcus, Is that you,
I don't believe it.

85
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,869
- Good afternoon mister Cortese

86
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,351
Claire you little minx.
Giving out my number again?

87
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,239
Knock it off Cortese.
This is not a god-damn field trip.

88
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,980
"Thank you doctor Mulrooney.
Load and clear as usual.

89
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,148
Getting in. Sensors on.

90
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,544
We got a self reading at 0.24 procent..

91
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:23,309
Professor, did you get that?

92
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:27,120
Mister Cortese would you please
adjust your image stabilizer.

93
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:28,955
Thank you!

94
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:32,105
We're in position at 24-30.

95
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,425
GPS Reading...

96
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,921
three meters down four meters...

97
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:40,637
Temperature six degrees
centigrade and dropping.

98
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,314
We've reached point zero.

99
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,793
I think it's appropriate a
Turkel does the honours.

100
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,705
We're through the seal!

101
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:50,636
The inner chamber.
It's at least a 100 meters wide.

102
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,926
- Holy shit!
- What is it? What have you found?

103
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:58,793
"Talos"

104
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:03,985
In a sarcophagus...
suspended from the ceiling.

105
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,156
..and bodies...
everywhere!

106
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,210
It's nothing like what history
thought us to expect.

107
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,867
Well the history books
are just been rewritten.

108
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:15,707
Whatever...

109
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:19,016
They obviously never
wanted this guy to get out.

110
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,049
The dead were interred with the objects

111
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,450
they valued most in life.

112
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,400
It was only proper they should entomb Talos
within his own chamber of horrors

113
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:41,616
- Professor, Can you see this?
- Yes, Samantha, yes I see it.

114
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:43,211
It's magnificent..oh..

115
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:49,505
Worship of the stars was standard
practice. The sun in particular.

116
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:54,864
Yes, but these are planets...
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.

117
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,369
Perfect alignment!

118
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,005
Cortese, are you al-right?"

119
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:09,769
cut you off..

120
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:11,880
Noooo

121
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:13,004
Brad?

122
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,034
Brad what's wrong

123
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:17,381
Stop it.....
Brad wil you slow down..

124
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:18,828
..S t o p I t...

125
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,805
Stop it!

126
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,830
!! Stop it!!

127
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,600
Breathe Brad!

128
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:28,624
Breathe...

129
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,980
Burke, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

130
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:34,161
- Breathe!
- Burke, what the hell are you doing?

131
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,231
Burke... come back!

132
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,277
Remember that token of our
engagement I never got you.

133
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,876
..about time to do a Cartier!

134
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:54,768
Fine Burke, you made your point.
You just come down slowly.

135
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,767
The Wadjet eye...
Exquisite

136
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:04,048
Burke, it's not worth it
it is not worth it...

137
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:06,471
Burke, don't move!

138
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:12,477
Burke..

139
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,317
Here you go...

140
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:26,362
Burke, look I got it now...
just..just come back slowly

141
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:30,986
aarrgghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

142
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:35,653
O my!

143
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:55,037
London, seven months later

144
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,404
- Hi Sam.
- Hi Trouble.

145
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,560
Hello baby.
Are you're hungry, hmm?

146
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,850
In Rome religious leaders from over a dozen

147
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,049
nations agreed that the impending planetary

148
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,049
alignment directly correlates

149
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,049
With the biblical cleansing

150
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,049
known as Judgement Day

151
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,450
Conversely scientist in Geneva
stressed that such an event

152
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,049
has in fact occurred many times

153
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,049
in the past, under the exception

154
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,049
of high tides and possible tremors

155
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,050
should in no way be construed
as a prelude to Armageddon.

156
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,690
The British Museum summons you to the past

157
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,367
the materials presented here

158
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:50,223
were recovered form a hidden
chamber in the Valley of the Kings

159
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,519
the wrappings are all that
remains of the Mummy: Talos lonPey

160
00:15:56,217 --> 00:16:03,157
Ladies and gentlemen, the museum is now closed
please make your way to the nearest exit

161
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,654
Thank you for your cooperation.

162
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,883
Excuse me Sir, I am afraid
we're closed for this evening.

163
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,881
Professor, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it was you.

164
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:14,269
No need to apologize
for doing your job Carl.

165
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:19,614
Oh, I didn't know it was so late.
Time stands still for no-one he?

166
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,114
Wouldn't you agree Prince?

167
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,725
Uh, this way Professor. Please let
me show you to the south wing.

168
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:02,516
Carl?

169
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,897
My God!!

170
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,808
We had a break in, room 32. One man down!

171
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:14,440
Request medical assistance!
I'll open the gate.

172
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,241
Hold on don't move him just yet.

173
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:33,096
The Americans are sending down
one from their lot to take a look.

174
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,280
Very well. We do not want to
create an international incident.

175
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:43,143
He was Terence Moore, United States Senate.
Here on holiday.

176
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:46,150
I knew he had to be pretty hot
to get you out of bed..

177
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:53,018
- Jesus Christ
- Very clean.

178
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:58,098
Both eyes extracted with the
optic nerve fully intact.

179
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:01,222
- What for?
- What do you mean what for?

180
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,463
There is no reasonable explanation
for an act of this kind.

181
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,427
In the mind of the killer there was...

182
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,905
- And you are?
- That's detective Riley, US Embassy.

183
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:18,604
Like you said, not done
with an ice-cream scooper.

184
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:20,999
Nah, that's precision
hand at work here.

185
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,415
Do you know if the eyes were removed
before or after the neck got crushed?

186
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,454
O my God, I should hope after!

187
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,180
Well we can all hope.

188
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,428
But maybe our killer prefers to see his
victims suffer a little before they go.

189
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,188
Victims? Excuse me aren't we jumping
just a bit ahead of ourselves.

190
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,427
What'd you find on him?

191
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:39,434
Eh, credit cards, Rolex,
pretty much everything

192
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:43,707
He wasn't mugged for his money!
This wasn't a thrill kill.

193
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,578
- Look, I need all details.
- You'll have to wait for the post-mortal..

194
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:53,584
- Oké, why you still here?
- Let's go...

195
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:05,176
He's probably watching us right now.
Hoping we'll appreciate the effort.

196
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:40,390
SAM
PLEASE READ

197
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:45,379
..PLEASE BELIEVE

198
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,224
THE TRUTH

199
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:05,398
Dr. Mulrooney...
that man's been phoning all morning.

200
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:11,788
Sounds stark raving mad,
do me a favour will you,

201
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:15,037
if he calls again, tell
him I've been transferred.

202
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,727
Thank you..

203
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:13,736
Stoopid.. Start..

204
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:10,025
So we got two victims.
First one's eyes

205
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,713
couldn't be seen. Second
one looses their lungs

206
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:16,765
- What else they have in common?
- They're both foreigners..

207
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,425
- Right. So what does this tell you?
- They weren't chosen at random.

208
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,415
Good, so eh.. find out
if Grasby had any ties,

209
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,394
occupational whatever,
to the American, and eh..

210
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:30,251
..call the consulate, see if there's
any relatives we can talk to.

211
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:33,106
Erm..give me that..

212
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:40,012
- Ah
- What's that?

213
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,542
Looks like Gauze

214
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,128
I know that smell

215
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,813
that's spice...
.. cinnamon

216
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:54,956
Don't worry, I'm a little
wizard in the kitchen

217
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,451
Pussywhipped is what you are

218
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,800
Yeah, you should go out more...

219
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,075
Pass, me water!

220
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:06,126
Thanks.

221
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:24,694
Oh, hello Bradley. Looking
uncommonly insane these days.

222
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:29,882
I think I mentioned that you look pretty
chic yourself. And of course there's

223
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:34,608
also that bug that's crawling right up your
arse, is still alive and kicking Clair!

224
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:38,340
- Now... Why wouldn't you take my calls?
- Let go of my arm.

225
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:42,240
- Why wont you take my calls?!
- You want me to call the guard?

226
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,308
I tell you, you know it's started don't you?

227
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:51,058
We found it, we're responsible and we
got three days to find it again.

228
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,394
Take some advice, Bradley oké

229
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,575
Take the same three days and find
yourself a really good shrink.

230
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,514
Please look, if we don't find
this thing... if we don't find...

231
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:04,625
What thing? I mean
Bradley, there never was a

232
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,684
thing. Talos is dust, if
he ever even existed!

233
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:12,620
What about the museum.. what about the museum?
What about three deaths in one week, Claire!!

234
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:15,856
..you don't see, but I can see..

235
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:23,868
- see, I see, I see everything!
- Jesus Christ
- Listen to me, let me be your guide..

236
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:28,044
Oh you know eh, if it's all the same
to you I'll take the unguided tour.

237
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:31,532
Claire,
Thursday 10:55

238
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:36,845
If it is not stopped, it's gonna be the beginning
of the end of the world for all the time..

239
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:27,694
- Hey... you want to make a move?
- I need to take a leak first.

240
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:46,562
Sir Richard Turkel Research Foundation

241
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,358
Miss Turkel's office?
Thank you.

242
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:00,538
Yes?

243
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:06,207
- I am looking for a Miss Turkel
- That's me. How can I help?

244
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,191
If you can spare a few
minutes away from your work?

245
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:11,973
Yes, sure..
Um.. just carry on..

246
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:18,727
I just so happens that that
worthless pile of rags is priceless..

247
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,548
- Only to people like yourself.
- Hah, right!

248
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,214
Does that make me a suspect then?

249
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:28,110
Merely an expert. Mister Bradley
Cortese, you hear from him lately?

250
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:32,871
He's just fired from another job last week.
Been MIA ever since.

251
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:36,542
I see from your reaction, he's
more then just a colleague?

252
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:39,386
What's that supposed to imply?

253
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:43,510
I level with you Miss Turkel, our
suspect profile points to an

254
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,004
unstable individual with serous
ties with this Talos exhibit.

255
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,639
..You're looking in the wrong place..

256
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,077
Brad, has his problems, yes.
But violence is not one of them.

257
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,977
Were you and Cortese lovers?

258
00:28:57,955 --> 00:29:01,298
I don't think that is any of your
business, one way or the other.

259
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:04,672
I am only concerned for
your safety, Miss Turkel.

260
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,001
Bottom-line, if our man is linked to this exhibit

261
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:09,942
- He is linked to me..

262
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:11,841
I'll be extra cautious, Detective.

263
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,100
My pager..

264
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:21,050
If there's anything you need.
Day or Night.

265
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,390
In fact there is something. My grandfather's logbook
was one of the items ceased from the museum..

266
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:33,432
When can I expect it back?

267
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:38,770
It's just that I ..um..
It means the world to me..

268
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:43,395
You have my word, you get it back
the second we're done with it.

269
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:47,254
Well, let's see if you're a man of his word.

270
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:55,244
Our victims turn three arrived at
Heathrow on September the seventh.

271
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:57,642
But they're on different airlines..

272
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,510
Security reported nothing unusual.

273
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,392
Most likely he targeted them when they landed.

274
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:06,006
..Oh for God sake!

275
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:12,257
Postal service, mister Cortese. I got a packet
that needs a signature.

276
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,946
Mister Cortese?

277
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,890
Shit!!

281
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:37,244
It looks like, you and Cortese
are on to the same Princess.

282
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:40,767
I'll get a car over to her place.

283
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:57,540
Son of a bitch!
Barton are you're okay? Barton?

284
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:09,084
- Barton?
- Erh perfect..

285
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:10,549
Shit!!

286
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:31,422
- Detective?
- Miss Turkel.

287
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:36,263
- This couldn't be a coincidence.
- It could, but isn't.

288
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:39,224
I've found this in Cortese's flat

289
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,194
I could use some of your experts advise.

290
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:43,509
What?

291
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:47,158
Let's get to my office.

292
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:50,654
Good news for a change?

293
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:53,588
Business as usual, eh Doc..

294
00:32:56,947 --> 00:32:59,455
- Night
- Night night

295
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:30,089
Oké, this is the ..eh.. core of the myth..

296
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:36,855
According to the inscriptions Talos had the organs
intentionally removed from his body by his own followers.

297
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:40,521
The cult believed that one day their
Prince would come back and reclaim them.

298
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,245
These organs were they taken
in a particular order?

299
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:47,587
The Eyes..
The lungs..

300
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:54,326
The pituitary gland..
The liver... the jaw

301
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:57,240
last but not least

302
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,046
the Heart..

303
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:04,092
What's it mean?
Resurrection?

304
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:09,332
- Well more accurately transmutation
- oh a scrabble word.

305
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:11,354
It's a term the alchemists used..

306
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:17,428
It means to ..um.. restore man to his
prime-ordeal condition of grace..

307
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:23,924
Strength, perfection and..
Eh.. physical immortality.

308
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:37,280
So what happens now?

309
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:41,745
He gets picked up, hopefully before
he commits his next atrocity.

310
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,094
- Yeah, that is if he
committed any to begin with.

311
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,018
For your friends sake, why don't you
tell me what you think is going on.

312
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,601
- Because Riley, you'd never believe me. Not in..
- 3,000 years?

313
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:57,974
Hey listen..

314
00:35:57,998 --> 00:36:03,436
I have been on the Gold dig myself, and I
just happen to know a fine Irish pub

315
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,032
A cop named Riley knows a fine
Irish pub, you surprise me..

316
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:14,042
- Am I still wasting my time Miss Turkel?
- Why don't you call me Sam.

321
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:49,030
Well then it's your obligation to
tell the authorities what you saw.

Gone....Everyone is gone!

But you got me, you're
not gonna loose me..

324
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:05,119
Al-right?
I'm going with you..

325
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:15,081
Put the phone, putt the... putt
the phone down... Edith now!!

326
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:17,383
You need to help, Bradley

327
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:22,795
I know bloody shit Sherlock, and you Edith are it

328
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:26,664
You are not gonna deny me Edith
you're not gonna deny me!

329
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:34,838
I want you Edith to take me to
the eyes of his next victim..

330
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,791
I feel ashamed to admit, I gave very
little thought of Burke's death

331
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:46,713
You're defences were up?

332
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,232
No..

333
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:55,675
My mind was on that sarcophagus...
and the wrappings..

334
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,904
Heh...
the un-presence

335
00:38:00,798 --> 00:38:05,200
For weeks and no one would go
near them not even the flies

336
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:09,847
They just lie there,
half buried in the sand

337
00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:14,687
And madness to go to the camp... and
none of us seem to have any control over

338
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:20,632
It affected everyone..
Each in totally different ways

339
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:25,522
it was the darkness...
you could.. we could feel

340
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:35,827
You're cut off

341
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,207
I wasn't the only one who felt it, Riley

342
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:48,606
It had power. It was tangible

343
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:06,414
Argh, my heart's racing

344
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:08,933
That because it's not yours
it belongs to the other

345
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,302
Gonna bust out of my chest

346
00:39:16,114 --> 00:39:18,631
Remember this isn't your vision..

347
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:28,006
- Oké, I'm ready, Edith.
- Release! Open your eyes

348
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:44,636
Where are you, Bradley?

349
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,839
Still in London

350
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,820
I'm going down some stairs

351
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,208
It's cold. I'm walking..
I'm walking on my hands..

352
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:13,578
I know what stop it is..
I know where he's going, Edith!

353
00:40:13,674 --> 00:40:14,974
Let's go!

354
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:18,269
Get out of the way!

355
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,312
..get out of my way..
..out of my way..

356
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,410
What's happening Queeny?
What do you smell?

357
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,967
Al-right then, go and get your supper.

358
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,853
What's up girl.
What's happening?

359
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:58,950
O my god... Queeny what's the matter?

360
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:01,665
Get out of the way
get out... of the way

361
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,451
Queeny, Queeny come on!!
Queeny! Queeny!

362
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:15,583
What have you done to my dog?

363
00:41:18,072 --> 00:41:19,272
Enough!!

364
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:21,615
Killer!

365
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:25,945
- you stupid bastard..You don't understand.
- Where's my dog?
- You don't understand.

366
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:29,112
- Where is my dog?
- Get off me!!

367
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:35,159
- You okay to go up alone?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

368
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:38,662
Brad knows better than to show up here.

369
00:41:38,718 --> 00:41:43,519
It's not Brad you're afraid of.
Go on say the name: Talos

370
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,413
I think Brad heard voices.

371
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:04,758
I didn't tell you first hand that he .. is dangerously
obsessed with this whole .. past lives theme.

372
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:07,756
Maybe..

373
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:16,164
But what if just this once, the voices
that somebody was hearing were real?

374
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:22,987
Night Riley..

375
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:02,829
Disgusting Bastards

376
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,990
Argh..
Oh shit!

377
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:15,525
- Dispatch to Riley, over.
- What's up?

378
00:44:15,546 --> 00:44:19,115
Bradley Cortese has been spotted in
the vicinity of Notting Hill Gate

379
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:20,687
Shit!

380
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:54,628
No, I don't hear you...

381
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:04,183
- hello?
- Got ya!

382
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:07,570
Brad, um .. I can't
talk right now,

383
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:10,174
Don't hang up, don't hang up,
I'm gonna go crazy if ya hang up!

384
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,207
Brad, I'm on my way out I have a date.

385
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:16,024
O, with that cop, is that your date?
That cop that lied to me?

386
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,828
Where are you?

387
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:23,538
You sound scared, Sam...
I don't blame you..

388
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,042
- You should be.
- O god, Brad!

389
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,054
What are you doing here?
What happened? Whose blood is it?

390
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:44,726
- It's not mine
- Whose is it?
- It's from the one he.. eh.. got before you.

391
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:46,648
What are you talking about?

392
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:50,606
He wants what you got, Sam!
You can't let him take it..

393
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:54,959
Help me... help me by saying you understand?
Please...

394
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:58,381
Of course I understand,
I was there remember, Yeah?

395
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,056
- Kneel down, Sam
- wha .. what?

396
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:09,202
- Kneel down..
- What?

397
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,570
For what?
What are you doing?

398
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,489
You don't need to worry..

399
00:46:15,513 --> 00:46:18,456
I will see, I will see you on the flip side.

400
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:21,075
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stop this Brad.

401
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:25,699
Don't worry, because I'm
gonna be right behind you...

402
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:26,950
Please...

403
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:31,769
Brad, stop it!
What are you doinggg?!

404
00:46:32,712 --> 00:46:33,735
Brad stop!

405
00:46:34,256 --> 00:46:36,867
- Brad!!
- forgive me, Sam
- Noooo!

406
00:46:47,063 --> 00:46:48,063
Can't resist.

407
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:07,116
For the purpose of this interview Mr.Cortese agreed
to wave his rights to have a lawyer present.

408
00:47:07,354 --> 00:47:09,845
It's not a lawyer I need, it's a undertaker.

409
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:16,011
Cause you are talking to a dead man..
Dead man talking..

410
00:47:18,082 --> 00:47:19,837
Why do you want to harm Miss Turkel?

411
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:25,761
Don't wanna harm her, she's my family.
It's like a bloody sister.

412
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:30,293
What about them? Were they like
your brothers and sisters?

413
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:34,947
No...

414
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:39,471
Take a good look. Did he piss you off?

415
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:44,465
No, not him. It's just it..
.. it's what inside him

416
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:47,677
His Liver

417
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,920
Yes, 'officer Dibble', his
liver pissed me off!!

418
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:58,305
If you can't have a pass to piss you off,
you can't let out the anger, is that it?

419
00:47:59,683 --> 00:48:01,790
Mmm, what if it blows your head back, baby?

420
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:06,334
- You smug bastard!
- Barton!

421
00:48:09,919 --> 00:48:12,151
- Go get some air

422
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:17,165
See ya..

423
00:48:21,676 --> 00:48:24,668
Your mate is... a tad pissed off, I can tell...

424
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:28,239
Naturally. He is convinced that we have our man.

425
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:34,455
- O, no not me, officer Dibble it's someone else.
- Then prove him wrong! ....Who?

426
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:39,751
I tell you for a fag.

427
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:54,030
You see your mystery, officer..
Started about 3,000 years ago.

428
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:58,571
And your suspect was a Greek
heretic exiled from his home land..

429
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:01,855
..for performing acts of .. sorcery..

430
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:08,930
His name was, and still is: Talos.

431
00:49:13,222 --> 00:49:18,088
Five years later a man called Talos
Ionpey arrived in ancient Egypt.

432
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:22,287
He was cultured, he was charming,
he is a master of language, mathematics..

433
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:24,062
And... the dark science.

434
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:31,343
This impressed King Amenhotep, and Talos quickly
became part of the royal family inner circle..

435
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:37,106
Not long after he wed the King's
stunning daughter Nefrianna..

436
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:42,842
Ah, Nefrianna worshipped her dark Prince..

437
00:49:42,922 --> 00:49:47,537
Those who opposed his particular brand of
theology were struck down with disease.

438
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:51,600
Or worse, he tortured to believe him!

439
00:49:52,921 --> 00:50:00,098
They bring factions, pleaded with King Amenhotep to
put an end to this mad foreigners reign of terror

440
00:50:00,105 --> 00:50:03,221
So you see... an assassination was plotted

441
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:07,980
But again the poor old King miscalculated.

442
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:11,758
He informed Nefrianna of his intended deed.

443
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:15,332
And she in return told her Dark Prince.

444
00:50:17,174 --> 00:50:20,314
Talos decided if he was going to die,

445
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:22,727
it will be on his own terms..

446
00:50:23,972 --> 00:50:27,785
The Kings battalion stormed the chamber.

447
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:30,755
But the Prince had come up with the perfect plan..

448
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:34,596
..to preserve his soul, for his eventual return

449
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,813
Mummification!!!

450
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:41,173
But for the King the worst
horror was yet to come..

451
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:46,153
For deep inside the chamber
the embalmers were discovered

452
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:50,668
Cannibalizing Prince Talos his organs..

453
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,891
His own daughter chewing on the heart..

454
00:50:53,977 --> 00:50:57,570
Well, the King promptly put
the followers to death..

455
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:02,315
He himself impaling Nefrianna upon the spikes..

456
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:04,599
And Talos?

457
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:10,307
Talos?
Well you see, his body was never found!

458
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:14,071
Only the wrappings.

459
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:19,516
And inscribed inside the chamber
it says that his soul ..

460
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:24,177
'Kah'... awaits in purgatory
until the day of his rebirth.

461
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:28,559
Which happens to be this Thursday.

462
00:51:30,062 --> 00:51:33,579
At 10:55. When the planets align?

463
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:39,083
So these four victims...

464
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:42,704
.. are all reincarnations of his followers

465
00:51:43,029 --> 00:51:46,825
No, officer Riley, it's five you see.
You're forgetting the dog.

466
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,402
Who said you have to come
back wearing the same skin?

467
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,768
..You still don't get it, do ya?

468
00:51:54,806 --> 00:51:59,582
Don't you see he taking back his organs?
So he can live again..

469
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:07,757
I saw Nefrianna's face in that chamber.
I saw Sam's face!

470
00:52:08,863 --> 00:52:15,486
She is the final carrier. Her grandfather
was the final link in the chain!

471
00:52:15,488 --> 00:52:18,434
It fed them . . the moment
that tomb was uncovered.

472
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:24,981
She is not responsible for the crimes of her
forefathers, but she is accountable for their sins!

473
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:29,636
..kill her!

474
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:33,147
Fuck off!!

475
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,688
God .. Someone has to destroy the heart!

476
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:44,419
Take a look, take a look and see mush
..seeing that's believing.

477
00:52:55,178 --> 00:52:57,005
Believe!

478
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:01,612
Believe..

479
00:53:04,145 --> 00:53:08,200
- Inspector, what's the word on Cortese?
- We're holding him till morning.

480
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:09,849
Where do you want me to stick him?

481
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:14,492
I could make a suggestion..
Eh..stick him in number 5.

482
00:53:23,782 --> 00:53:30,426
Brad, not moving you until tomorrow. We can do
this the nice and easy way or the bullshit one.

483
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:34,436
- Well, the nice and easy way every time.
- That's a change..

484
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:41,514
- Shit! It's started.
- What did we just say?! No bullocks!

485
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:43,501
- Get out of here

486
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:49,327
O, hello..

487
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:57,553
I'm sorry

488
00:54:07,675 --> 00:54:09,203
Jesus!

489
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:44,327
How's he doing?

490
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:47,863
He get himself a padded cell.
Double security

491
00:54:49,008 --> 00:54:50,735
It's better than his victims

492
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:57,439
Hand delivered as promised.

493
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:04,102
Look for whatever reason, that tomb
brought grief to a good number of people.

494
00:55:05,229 --> 00:55:07,301
.. If it means anything..

495
00:55:08,465 --> 00:55:11,893
I think maybe your grandfather
had the right idea all along.

496
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:14,358
Thanks..

497
00:55:16,453 --> 00:55:18,920
Coming from you, it does..

498
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,276
(TV) We interrupt our regular
programming to bring you this

499
00:55:26,301 --> 00:55:29,082
live on the scene bulletin from
the City Police Headquarters..

500
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:31,933
Two corpses are now being
removed by medical personnel

501
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:34,290
One of the deceased is believed
to be a Detective Barton

502
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:36,397
a leading officer in the
grizzly murders that began..

503
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:41,914
Stay indoors until you hear from me, you have
round the clock protection untill he's nailed.

504
00:55:41,942 --> 00:55:44,896
- Forget it, I'm coming with you..
- Sam please, I have no time to argue.

505
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:49,429
Oké Riley, on one condition, you give me your
word this is not come off until I take it off.

506
00:55:49,454 --> 00:55:53,994
Is this a joke, you see what's happening out
there? - Yeah, it is a joke .. you and me?

507
00:56:29,622 --> 00:56:34,263
Instant Cadaveric Spasm, it's
obvious from the discolouration..

508
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:38,109
And severe trauma to the
neck, crushed the vertebrae.

509
00:56:38,138 --> 00:56:41,607
Happened just like that!
I don't imagine he suffered much.

510
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,835
Tea?

511
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:51,710
In Point effect is N. Rope loop, five letters.

512
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:55,374
- Noose.
- No, I meant a spot of tea

513
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,598
You know, like Lipton's

514
00:56:57,304 --> 00:57:01,889
- O, sounds lovely.
- how are you on lemon?
- Lemon, Thank you!

515
00:57:57,853 --> 00:57:59,706
Help! Someone help me!

516
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:07,333
Help!
Let me in!!

517
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,590
Sam, Sam what is going on?

518
00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:15,638
- There's something out there..
- wha what.. No no no,
- There's something out there!!

519
00:58:16,443 --> 00:58:18,234
It's Sam from 28. She's upset..

520
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:21,866
- It's Sam from 28
- There is nothing there, please no

521
00:59:39,669 --> 00:59:42,814
.Help... Stop!
Please help me..

522
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:45,103
Stop!
Please....!

523
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,300
- Eye witnesses?
- A whole bunch.. all dead

524
01:00:47,442 --> 01:00:49,253
If cats could talk, he?

525
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,107
Evening Standard

526
01:01:24,165 --> 01:01:31,096
Only ten hours to go, read all about it
four planets unite... Eeeevening Standard.

527
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,829
"Edith Butros, you pleased
to make my acquaintance.

528
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:44,398
This is .. Detective Riley, I came across
your card in Brad Cortese's apartment.

529
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:49,360
- What sort of trouble is he in now?
- I'm afraid he is way past all that.

530
01:01:49,615 --> 01:01:51,581
Brad's dead?

531
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:55,770
He was saying some..eh ..
Unusual things before he went..

532
01:01:57,139 --> 01:02:00,802
- Too unusual to believe
- Well you believe him..

533
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:04,218
Yeah, just about..

534
01:02:04,313 --> 01:02:05,879
Al-right..

535
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,767
I'll do what I can for you.

536
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:13,655
Thank you.
Goodbye.

537
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:18,892
Professor Marcus, I'm detective Riley.

538
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:22,762
Ah yes, yes, yes.
I came as soon as I received your message.

539
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:25,285
Any further news about Sam?

540
01:02:25,361 --> 01:02:29,918
Not yet... I've spoken with Dr. Mulrooney,
and she's agreed to rendezvous.

541
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,687
Ah begrudgingly, I'm sure.

542
01:02:32,905 --> 01:02:35,842
So you believe that this thing has gone after Sam

543
01:02:35,845 --> 01:02:37,908
..to eh .. reclaim it's heart?

544
01:02:38,377 --> 01:02:42,808
According to Bradley the final piece of the
puzzle resides within her bosom.

545
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:47,009
Bradley Cortese is a psychotic,
listen to yourself! This is insane!

546
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,369
Or it's prophecy!

547
01:02:48,864 --> 01:02:51,066
We have less than five hours to find her.

548
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:54,215
Does anybody have reasonable suggestions?

549
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:57,520
Well, I have one somewhat unorthodox one.

550
01:02:57,585 --> 01:03:02,284
Why am I not surprised, it
involves the spirit world no doubt.

551
01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:06,865
- We need a vessel to contact her.
- Something with spiritual resonance.

552
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,541
You know for Sam I was willing to listen to
anything bordering on the rational, but this..

553
01:03:11,844 --> 01:03:13,484
Claire please..

554
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:15,933
Doctor wait... Wait, wait, wait

555
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:21,739
Look I don't expect you to put your faith
into something I only half believe myself.

556
01:03:21,812 --> 01:03:26,373
But if there's a chance, one shot in a million, that
what that woman claims she can do, will help find Sam..

557
01:03:26,764 --> 01:03:28,228
I am willing to give it a try.

558
01:03:31,235 --> 01:03:36,415
Look eh, I'm scared oké, I mean,
you can understand that can't you?

559
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:41,389
Yes.
Absolutely.

560
01:03:43,893 --> 01:03:47,876
Al-right, you win, what do you need?

561
01:04:20,196 --> 01:04:24,029
You're with "Samantha now
what is she showing you?

562
01:04:27,051 --> 01:04:30,349
- Look I am sorry, but am I the only one..
- Doctor please, please..

563
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,934
Excuse me, but I mean
she talking to a dead body..

564
01:04:33,149 --> 01:04:36,868
Death doesn't exist, it's
only a transference of energies.

565
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:39,705
And if we can tap into his before it moves on..

566
01:04:52,327 --> 01:04:54,004
He's found her..

567
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:00,238
Ask her to guide you..

568
01:05:06,017 --> 01:05:07,820
Have her show you where she is!

569
01:05:10,484 --> 01:05:13,908
- Al-right, let's concentrate.
- Give me your hands..

570
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:16,217
Close your eyes..

571
01:05:25,652 --> 01:05:27,101
Help!

572
01:05:52,508 --> 01:05:56,028
- This can't be happening
- Where is she, Brad?

573
01:05:57,338 --> 01:05:59,031
Tell us what she sees?

574
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:14,537
Bradley, her eyes are your eyes!
Have her tell us what she sees!

575
01:06:35,766 --> 01:06:37,499
The Pyramid Hotel

576
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:49,206
What do you see?!
Bradley?

577
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:57,482
Where is she, Bradley?

578
01:07:11,622 --> 01:07:16,133
- I saw that...
- Yeah, I saw that..

579
01:07:20,092 --> 01:07:21,092
Bradley...!

580
01:07:37,146 --> 01:07:40,079
Symbols? What do they mean?

581
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:41,910
Literal translation

582
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:47,092
Under the pyramid..
On the water.

583
01:07:47,152 --> 01:07:49,272
Does it trigger anything?

584
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:52,167
No, I'm afraid not.

585
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:58,575
You know there's a construction site on the Thames?
The skeleton of one of those old super Hotels.

586
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:02,494
Ah yes, I remember. During the
initial phase... a level collapsed.

587
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:04,692
A completion was suspended..

588
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,300
Sound like his kind of hotel..

589
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:11,714
Yes, but if it were, I mean, how do you stop
something that hasn't died in 3000 years?

590
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:42,226
The wadjet’s eye symbolizes
the left eye of Horus..

591
01:08:42,283 --> 01:08:45,010
.. Ripped out during his battle with Seth!

592
01:08:45,568 --> 01:08:50,906
It possesses extraordinary powers of protection,
we must keep it with us at all times.

593
01:08:50,915 --> 01:08:55,972
What you mean this is it. This is our only
weapon against this force you been describing?

594
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:08,790
Fuck!

595
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:18,826
Waterloo bridge is our best hope.
Now step on it!

596
01:09:18,891 --> 01:09:22,055
We never make it through the gridlock
do you know an alternate route?

597
01:09:22,096 --> 01:09:23,959
What about this one?

598
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:06,829
This is it..

599
01:11:10,096 --> 01:11:11,124
Stand clear

600
01:11:19,906 --> 01:11:21,219
Come on..

601
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,876
Watch your step..
Hurry up!

602
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,777
- Only 18 minutes left.. How's your ankle holding out?
- I'll be fine!

603
01:11:35,973 --> 01:11:36,973
Let's Go!

604
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,319
I have defeated..

605
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,319
..the will..

606
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,320
..of Amon Ra!
Never before..

607
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,994
..have human eyes..

608
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:42,900
..feasted upon such ...splendorrr.

609
01:12:43,571 --> 01:12:46,166
Rise and Kneel at the feet of Talos

610
01:12:51,965 --> 01:12:55,631
Nefrianna, does not kneel
at the order of infidels..

611
01:12:57,349 --> 01:12:58,349
What!!

612
01:13:17,933 --> 01:13:19,901
Ah, she could be anywhere..

613
01:13:19,954 --> 01:13:23,734
So why don't we split up?
That way we can cover more ground!

614
01:13:24,449 --> 01:13:26,916
Yes, yes good idea.
Come, we go this way.

615
01:13:34,508 --> 01:13:35,980
This way.. yes?

616
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:55,408
- Damn!
- It's OK, it's OK I got light
- I got ya...

617
01:14:12,255 --> 01:14:13,324
Talos!

618
01:14:14,071 --> 01:14:17,988
- Good evening Professor Marcus.
- You know my name!!

619
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,239
As I know your mind..

620
01:14:20,571 --> 01:14:26,219
Countless hours spend at the museum
you stand there in my funerary containment..

621
01:14:26,309 --> 01:14:30,060
Wondering what it would be
like to speak to a deity?

622
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:34,150
- Yes.. yes
- No!!

623
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:38,224
Fight him.. Professor, he's trying
to control your mind. Fight him!

624
01:14:44,252 --> 01:14:49,434
Begone, less you feel these knives of light!
The mighty Amon Ra commands you!!

625
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:51,058
Begone!
Begone!!

626
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,063
Begone!!!

627
01:15:00,082 --> 01:15:01,505
Begone!!

628
01:15:03,538 --> 01:15:06,639
We did it professor.
We did it..

629
01:15:11,137 --> 01:15:12,524
Be quiet Butros..

630
01:15:14,826 --> 01:15:19,391
Be quiet!
On your knees in worship!

631
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:27,950
O my goodness, what have I done?

632
01:15:29,964 --> 01:15:31,254
What have I done?

633
01:15:33,584 --> 01:15:35,082
The light..

634
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:36,596
- We have 6 minutes!
- Oké

635
01:15:45,423 --> 01:15:47,414
Look I can't wait. We are out of time!
- I know..

636
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,040
Here give me that!

637
01:15:50,095 --> 01:15:53,148
Now go on, come on who's the doctor?

638
01:16:58,605 --> 01:17:01,305
Gender: Male - Age: 35
Deliver to: Dr.Claire Mulrooney

639
01:17:10,977 --> 01:17:13,652
Professor, there no time for that!

640
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:17,852
- Doctor! Where is Mr. Riley?
- O don't worry about him..

641
01:17:19,055 --> 01:17:20,947
What you doing with our palm reader?

642
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:27,189
No no, not me. That thing, it came to me.
I couldn't fight it back

643
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,236
What thing, Marcus?

644
01:17:31,451 --> 01:17:32,982
There's nothing here...

645
01:17:35,898 --> 01:17:40,361
Well, you were right,
extraordinary powers of protection.

646
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:41,624
Talos!

647
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:46,178
It came to you didn't it.
What did it promise you?

648
01:17:48,436 --> 01:17:51,535
Pompous arse.
Who are you to speak his name?

649
01:17:51,948 --> 01:17:54,469
You created the history you teach

650
01:17:55,344 --> 01:17:59,602
What are you saying?
Where is Mr. Riley?

651
01:17:59,643 --> 01:18:05,110
Exactly where he is suppose to be...
At exactly the right moment!

652
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:12,572
O my Prince..

653
01:18:33,844 --> 01:18:34,844
Sam?

654
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:40,115
Sam!

655
01:18:45,857 --> 01:18:46,933
Sam!

656
01:18:48,745 --> 01:18:49,829
Riley!

657
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:55,849
Sam!

658
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:02,162
- It's all real..
- I know..

659
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:09,004
Get away from her!

660
01:19:18,627 --> 01:19:20,781
Now your time has come, Princess!

661
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:24,399
Don't let him win, Riley!

662
01:19:25,901 --> 01:19:27,654
Don't let him win..

663
01:19:27,904 --> 01:19:32,109
Do it! Do it now!

664
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:36,941
I am very sorry ..
You'll never have your princess

665
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:49,000
I've already have my princess

666
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,559
The female served a noble purpose.

667
01:19:52,985 --> 01:19:56,566
Her bloodline led you back to me..

668
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:02,446
So fickle your Highness, falling in..
And out of love the way you do.

669
01:20:03,003 --> 01:20:05,244
For three millennia I waited

670
01:20:05,938 --> 01:20:11,689
Watching, guiding you through
all your incarnations

671
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,198
Nefrianna is alive within you.
Remember!

672
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:21,424
Remember, your Highness

673
01:20:24,582 --> 01:20:25,782
No!
No!

674
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:27,830
