00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

2
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,750
Do you believe in Hell?

3
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,000
That place which priests
talk about so much.

4
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:52,291
A dark, cruel abyss, where the souls
of the condemned are sent.

5
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,958
A place inhabited by terrible demons
who punish and torture the condemned.

6
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,416
Hell,

7
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:08,208
where all hope is lost upon entry.

8
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:13,666
Hell's subjects beguile sinners with ease,

9
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,666
tempting them
with fulfilling their desires

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,666
in exchange for their mortal souls.

11
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,875
Few have escaped successfully
from such a terrible pact.

12
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,875
This story, like many others,

13
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:31,416
begins with a man of flesh and blood.

14
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,916
A man who outwitted that fearful pact.

15
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:41,500
A man so evil, so cruel,

16
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,916
that even the Devil himself
would fear him.

17
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,875
A blacksmith.

18
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:01,625
1835. 1ST CARLIST WAR.
ARABA, BASQUE COUNTRY

19
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,208
Soldier. Come here.

20
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,958
Well?

21
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,583
Sir, it seems these old-fashioned

22
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,666
were trying to transport something
to the north.

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,541
Sir. Look at this.

24
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,791
I bet Zumalacárregui will have trouble
entering Bilbao without this.

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,500
That's enough, Father.

26
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,291
We don't have all day.

27
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,125
Firing squad!

28
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Attention!

29
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,750
Get ready!

30
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,875
Take aim!

31
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,041
Fire!

32
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,625
Deliver this to the major. It's urgent.

33
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,416
Devil.

34
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,125
8 YEARS LATER

35
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,708
Look at these treasures.

36
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,875
Faustino, that's all rubbish.

37
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,375
Santi, your eyes are deceiving you.

38
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,833
Look at this. It's a relic.

39
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:32,250
Links from the chain that the legendary
Teodosio de Goñi carried as penance

40
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,666
when he witnessed the death
of the Dragon of Aralar

41
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,458
from the hands of St. Michael.

42
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,541
If you bite this,

43
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,583
it will ease your headache, Santi.

44
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,041
Only 30 reals.

45
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,250
Sell that to the priest.
I'm sure he'll buy it.

46
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,375
Good morning.

47
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,166
Good morning, sir. What can I get you?

48
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:10,000
Nothing, thank you.
Do you have a room free?

49
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,750
Yes, and with a very comfortable bed.
Ten reals a night.

50
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,166
Very well.

51
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll prepare it right away.

52
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,500
Won't you have something meanwhile?

53
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,208
I've got excellent Patxaran.
The best in the region.

54
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,666
And the Txakoli is very good.

55
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,125
I don't drink, thank you.

56
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,750
May I ask what brings you to our town?

57
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,375
My name is Alfredo Ortiz.

58
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,125
I work for the provincial government.
I'm investigating a matter.

59
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,500
An investigation? About what?

60
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,583
I'm looking for a smithy in this area.

61
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,041
There's only one smithy here
and it's in ruins.

62
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:50,000
I need to talk to its proprietor,
a certain Francisco.

63
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,041
Patxi? The blacksmith?

64
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,916
Don't even think of it! That man is mad.

65
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,750
He's an animal. And he's dangerous.
He's so fierce they call him the Hammer.

66
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,583
The locals avoid that place.
It just brings trouble.

67
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,958
I just need to go in there
to carry out a search.

68
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,416
Is there something of value there?

69
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,583
I'm sorry, that's confidential.

70
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,375
Are you alone? Maybe we could help you.

71
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,750
I've come ahead to start work
on the investigation.

72
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,958
The police will be here
in a couple of days.

73
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,583
Look, it's bad enough
that they raise our taxes.

74
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,333
We don't need more nonsense.

75
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
That smithy is a ruin.

76
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,916
You won't find anything of value
in this area.

77
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,875
During the war, everything was melted down
to make weapons,

78
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,375
from cooking pots to the church bell.

79
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,333
This is a poor town.

80
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,541
And that room?

81
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,458
Yes.

82
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,416
Benito!

83
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:54,416
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
and take this gentleman to his room.

84
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,583
I'm coming.

85
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,458
And put a blanket over the still.

86
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,375
Come this way, sir.

87
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,916
By the way, how do I get to the smithy?

88
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,208
Take the path on the left
when you reach the wash house.

89
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:26,375
Then follow the river through the forest.
But be careful.

90
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,875
The Devil lives there.

91
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,375
GET OUT OF HERE

92
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,625
From what I hear, today a government
official has come to our town.

93
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,791
Naive of me to think
he would share our mass with us.

94
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:51,000
Here we have the contempt
of the new government for the Church.

95
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:56,833
The Devil is among us,
walking through our lands,

96
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,583
in the form of filthy liberal ideas

97
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,041
which draw good people away
from the word of the Lord.

98
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,375
It's been three years since the war ended.

99
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,083
Three years during which those
avaricious bourgeois fornicators

100
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,041
have ruled the country.

101
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,833
-What's that?
-Nothing.

102
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:15,750
Give me that.

103
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,458
They have even moved our borders,

104
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,291
and now traders can cross to the sea,
without any control,

105
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,750
without paying duties.

106
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,875
They have torn our customs,

107
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,916
our laws from us.

108
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,250
What will be next?

109
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,083
Let's pray.

110
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,458
-Let us pray to Our Lord Jesus Christ.
-We pray to you, Our Lord.

111
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,625
Benito, do you know where Usue is?

112
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,208
How should I know? She must be around.

113
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,583
But you're always following after her.

114
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,083
What the hell do you mean?

115
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,125
Mind your manners.

116
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,750
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
where has the child gone to?

117
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:16,291
Let us proceed to the Eucharist.
Let us drink the blood of the Lord.

118
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,875
For God's sake, Blanca.
Where did you put the mass wine?

119
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,791
There.

120
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,333
I don't like it.

121
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:03,166
Don't be cheeky, Matilde.
Behave like a young lady.

122
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,583
If your mother was alive, she'd slap you.

123
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,625
Are you crying again?

124
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,333
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

125
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,416
Come now, I didn't mean that.

126
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,958
Here, a present.

127
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,791
It was your mother's, you know?

128
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:31,041
And you, Mr. Napoleon,
console your wife, for God's sake.

129
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,000
Let us drink the blood of the Lord.

130
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,500
That's disgusting.

131
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,291
Hello. You've come.

132
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,666
You got our invitation.

133
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,208
Sit with us.

134
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,125
Let us continue with the mass.

135
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,791
Yes! Right on its head.

136
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,708
What did you do, you brute?

137
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:28,458
Shut up, shitface. I saved your life.
It was going to bite you.

138
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,666
No, idiot! It was my friend!

139
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,916
You're the idiot.
You're in trouble for missing Mass.

140
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,625
I don't care about going to Mass.
That's for idiots like you.

141
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:44,583
Then you'll go to Hell, like your mother.

142
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,333
What? Are you going to cry?

143
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,083
The hanged woman is burning!

144
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,875
Shut up!

145
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,833
Matilde!

146
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,291
Please, Usue, help me.

147
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,875
No! No!

148
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,666
Take your doll.

149
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,916
-Hold your head back.
-I know that.

150
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,166
Why are you stopping?

151
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,250
It's the mad blacksmith.

152
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,833
They say he kidnaps children,

153
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:30,458
slits them open and sucks out their guts.

154
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:35,083
My grandfather said
that he killed his wife.

155
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,041
He's scary.

156
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,083
Well, he doesn't scare me.
He looks like a beggar.

157
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,666
Not so loud.

158
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,375
-I bet I can hit him.
-Benito, Benito, no.

159
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,541
The cock crowing at this time
is a bad omen.

160
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,250
Benito! Come here.

161
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,750
What happened to your nose?

162
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,833
We were playing near the smithy and Us...

163
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,458
and I slipped.

164
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,958
Lord knows what you were doing.

165
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,416
Why were you there, anyway?

166
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,291
I've told you to stay away
from that place.

167
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,500
-I went looking for Usue.
-And where is she?

168
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,083
I don't know. She stayed there.

169
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,208
-What'll I do with that girl?
-Did you lose her?

170
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,958
Why do I have to look after that runt?

171
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,291
Watch your mouth.

172
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,250
There she is.

173
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,833
Usue. Come here.

174
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,291
Do you think this is normal?
To disappear and not come to Mass?

175
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,041
Is that blood?

176
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,208
The Mass wine... Did you take it?

177
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,333
You shameless pup. I'll show you--

178
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,458
Don Mateo. Leave her to me.

179
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,125
Child, you'll end up in Hell.

180
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,791
I don't care! Hell is a lie!

181
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,166
Usue, that's enough.

182
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,458
Leave me alone! You're not my mother!
My mother is dead!

183
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,291
You should be harder on her.

184
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,625
Remember she's your responsibility,
not mine.

185
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,750
-Santi.
-What?

186
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,166
-Why aren't you behind the bar?
-Just a minute, dear.

187
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,083
Just a minute?

188
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:13,208
It's a letter from the war...
"Carlist load, a chest full of gold."

189
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,583
Gold?

190
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,375
Could that be
what the dandy's looking for?

191
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,041
The treasure of Zumalacárregui.

192
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,833
A treasure? Here in the town?

193
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,541
Excuse me, but I think that's mine.

194
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:30,416
Look, my son is a blockhead.
He took it out of curiosity.

195
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,916
I should report this.

196
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,666
Don't do that. What about...

197
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,041
if I let you have the room at half price?

198
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,333
No charge. You're our guest.
What do you say?

199
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:51,875
What about if you help me
get into the smithy today

200
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,458
and we'll forget everything?

201
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:59,708
Today? I don't know. Maybe later.

202
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,791
-Santi.
-What?

203
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,083
-You have work in the bar.
-Ana.

204
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,916
I have to do the cooking.

205
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,958
Don't worry, brother.

206
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,708
I'll do it with my friends to pay back
what I owe you.

207
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,791
-That's not a bad idea.
-Ana.

208
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,250
It's fine with me.

209
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,000
Do you think there's gold in the smithy?

210
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,958
Twelve pounds in pieces of gold.

211
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,750
Donated by the Tsar of Russia
to the Carlist cause

212
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,916
so that Captain Tomás Zumalacárregui
could lay siege to Bilbao.

213
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,208
But the gold never
reached its destination.

214
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,875
How do you know all that?

215
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,291
It was a rumor among the soldiers.

216
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,166
I thought it was a tale to entertain us.

217
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,708
But they also said there were lamias
on the banks of the Bidasoa,

218
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,666
women with ducks' feet.

219
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,416
Be quiet.
You're a bore with those stories.

220
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:56,791
This letter and the enlistment documents
point directly to that blacksmith.

221
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,041
If I were you,
I wouldn't go near that place.

222
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,833
You know how his wife was found.

223
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:11,000
She killed herself
because she was so unhappy with him.

224
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,125
The Hammer lost his mind,

225
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,916
he stopped speaking to people
and started behaving violently.

226
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,458
He left Fermín, the honey maker,
lame in one leg, just for speaking to him.

227
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:28,333
At night, you can hear him
in the distance,

228
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,000
banging the anvil with his hammer.

229
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:36,375
At times, there are horrible screams, too,
that chill your blood.

230
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:41,666
Some say that it's the ghost of his wife,
screaming.

231
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:47,833
Others say that it's the Devil,

232
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,958
who wants to take the blacksmith's soul.

233
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,250
Will you tell me the joke
so I can laugh, too?

234
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:59,458
No, it's nothing. We were just saying
how elegantly you're dressed.

235
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,458
It's the beret my father wore
during the war.

236
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,583
Go in and search the place
until you find something suspicious.

237
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,666
Aren't you coming?

238
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:19,416
I'd just be in the way.
I'm no good at field work.

239
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,708
As you wish.

240
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,625
There's a chain.

241
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,833
Now you're not laughing so much?

242
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,958
Okay, like we said. Let's go.

243
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,083
Go away!

244
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,708
Listen, excuse me...

245
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,041
Get out of here!

246
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:35,125
This is an official mission.
We represent the government.

247
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,833
Open the door. It's a search.

248
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,708
I said, get out of here!

249
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,583
Please, come out,
or we'll have to enter by force.

250
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:56,166
For your own good,
it's best if you come out.

251
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,666
Back! Back!

252
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:43,833
Miguel! Miguel! Miguel!

253
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,125
Get out of here.

254
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:19,333
-Where's Lucas? And the dandy?
-I don't know. Run!

255
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,250
What an ugly doll. It's got no head.

256
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:05,333
Mine is pretty.
My father bought it for me.

257
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,458
Can I hold it?

258
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:10,083
No! Don't let her.
She can play with her dead doll.

259
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,416
She isn't dead.

260
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,750
If she's got no head, she can't eat,
and so she'll die.

261
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:20,208
My mother says
that her mother hanged herself.

262
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:26,125
Your mother is in Hell. Leave us in peace.

263
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,333
Go hang from a rope! Go hang from a rope!

264
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,166
Go hang from a rope!

265
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,708
Go hang from a rope, shitface.

266
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,125
You're not dead.

267
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:58,291
Leave that there
and put more wood on the fire.

268
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,625
Yes, yes.

269
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:26,416
Usue,
I know that I'm hard on you at times.

270
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,416
I have to be,
to keep you on the right road.

271
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:34,416
But I want you to know
that I'm always here for you.

272
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:40,500
If someone hangs himself and dies,
does he always go to Hell?

273
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,666
Suicide is a mortal sin. You know that.

274
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:48,416
Hell is the only place
those poor souls can go.

275
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,375
But if that person wasn't bad,
is there no way to come back?

276
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,916
Some things just can't be fixed, child.

277
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,041
But?

278
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,833
No more nonsense. Forget it.

279
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,208
Usue, where are you going?

280
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,041
But you can be fixed.

281
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,958
Don't worry, Matilde.

282
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:39,458
I'll find your head
and you'll be alive again.

283
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,750
Where is the spade?

284
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,875
Hello?

285
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:36,625
Don't make any noise. Help me, please.

286
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:40,708
Get me out of here before he comes back.

287
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,583
He hurts me.

288
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:49,458
He's a monster.
Please, little friend, get me out of here.

289
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:18,291
The keys. They're on his belt.
You have to get them.

290
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:21,458
How? No, I can't...

291
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,833
Yes. Yes, you can, little friend.

292
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:27,375
Don't leave me here. It's horrible.

293
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,208
He's coming back. Hide.

294
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,875
Yes, hide. Son of a bitch.

295
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,375
Come on.

296
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,833
Hurry up. Before he wakes...

297
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,333
Stop. Let me do it.

298
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,458
If you take one more step,
I'll rip off her head.

299
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:34,708
By Abraxas,
this isn't the end, blacksmith.

300
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:38,458
Your soul belongs to me. It belongs to me.

301
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:43,125
I will return
with the most terrible infernal hosts

302
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:48,500
to tear it out of you while you die,

303
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:52,666
screaming in the most unbearable torment.

304
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:57,208
I'll take this tidbit for the journey.

305
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,333
My horn. Damn bastard!

306
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:23,125
I'll slit you open and eat your guts.

307
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,875
-Be careful!
-Didn't you even manage to get in?

308
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,000
That place is a fortress.

309
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,416
It's obvious... he has the gold.

310
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,791
I told you not to go there.

311
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:38,916
We have to get him, for Lucas.
An eye for an eye.

312
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,458
Don't be stupid.
Do you want to get killed, too?

313
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:42,625
I'm not going back.

314
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,875
-Santi!
-What?

315
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,625
Where's Benito? It's getting dark.

316
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,541
I don't know. Can't you see I'm busy?

317
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:55,625
You should worry more
about your own family...

318
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,875
-Ana.
-...and less about those mules.

319
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,166
This mule is my brother.

320
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:04,250
-Look. There's the rascal. Come over here.
-Benito!

321
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:07,416
Apologize to your mother
for having worried her.

322
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,000
Wait, Santi. Something's happened to Usue.

323
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,333
He's got her. The blacksmith's got Usue.

324
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:23,000
He took her. And the Devil was there, too.

325
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,083
Now, calm down, Benito.

326
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,125
What are you saying?
Has the blacksmith got Usue?

327
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,833
Yes, and it looked...

328
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,125
It looked like she was dead.

329
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:40,416
Stay with your mother.

330
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:45,833
The poor child.
We have to go and help her.

331
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,500
That man is a danger.

332
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,333
By the power vested in me
by the government,

333
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,166
I authorize you
to take the necessary measures.

334
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,083
That degenerate bastard.

335
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,541
I'm going there.

336
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,208
Ana, tell everyone you know,

337
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:07,208
they're to get armed
and meet us on the path to the smithy.

338
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,041
-Be careful.
-Who's coming with me?

339
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,875
I'm in. Who else?

340
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,625
Some day, they'll come looking for me.

341
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:13,500
And I'll throw your soul into the darkest,
most horrible abyss!

342
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,750
Look who missed you.

343
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,916
Do what you want. I don't care.

344
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,416
Time doesn't pass for me.

345
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,208
But you, sooner or later, you'll die,

346
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,750
and then you'll end up keeping
the pact you made.

347
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:41,291
There is no pact now.

348
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,375
I gave you what you wanted.

349
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:47,333
You got home safe and sound
to see your wife.

350
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,666
But it shouldn't have been like that!

351
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:56,458
It's not my fault that you're an ogre
and your wife found a better man.

352
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:16,041
You can do what you want to me,
but you made an unbreakable pact.

353
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:21,125
Hell never leaves any loose ends.

354
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:24,458
You hear me? No loose ends!

355
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,875
What are you doing here?

356
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,000
Get out.

357
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:55,958
Wait. Sit down.

358
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,500
Don't be afraid. Sit down.

359
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,083
Is this yours?

360
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:26,458
Give me the scarf.

361
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,958
And the scarf?

362
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,541
Is that yours, too?

363
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,125
It was my mother's.

364
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,958
Son of a thousand bitches!

365
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,166
Don't be afraid.

366
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,000
He's well chained up.

367
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,458
But you were lucky.

368
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,458
Is he the Devil?

369
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,375
Just a demon.

370
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:24,250
And he can't escape?

371
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,916
He can't go back empty-handed.

372
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,875
You're just a messenger,
isn't that right, Sartael?

373
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:36,250
Yes, and I've got a message for you
from Hell.

374
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:40,375
Your wife sends you warmest greetings!

375
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,833
What are you looking at, little girl?

376
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,458
Liar!

377
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:27,250
Wait. Stand back. Watch this.

378
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:38,833
No, no, not the chickpeas.

379
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,208
How many chickpeas are there?

380
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:43,791
No!

381
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:51,125
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

382
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:55,791
He is blinded by it.
He can't help it. He has to count them.

383
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,375
One, two, three...

384
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,833
Don't do that!

385
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,875
One, two, three...

386
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,083
We will do another thing.

387
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,291
It's blessed.

388
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:04,041
I hate you! I hate you! Damn humans...

389
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:09,375
Why do I have to put up with this? Why?

390
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,083
Shut up.

391
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:13,958
You're a bunch of unbearable,
whining souls.

392
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:19,125
I hate having to punish you.

393
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:28,958
But you are worse.

394
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:32,875
You don't see your guilt

395
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:36,500
and you torment everyone else!

396
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:39,291
Like you did with your wife!

397
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:49,375
Leave. They'll be looking for you.

398
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,333
Wait.

399
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:52,416
What do you want?
Haven't you had enough fun?

400
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:57,083
I'm sorry I hurt you before.

401
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,458
I didn't mean to.

402
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:03,208
By St. Michael's bastard! You, brat?

403
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:07,000
Do you think you can hurt me?

404
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:10,333
I was born in the flames of Hell.

405
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:17,875
The thing is, I have problems with my ears
because of the damp in here.

406
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:21,166
Are you from Hell? Really?

407
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,500
What do you think?

408
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:28,250
Have you seen my mother? Her name's Maite.

409
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:31,375
There are lots of souls in Hell.

410
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,750
How do you know your mother is in Hell?

411
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:44,041
Was she bad to you?

412
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:49,625
I never knew her.

413
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:53,458
She killed herself soon after I was born.

414
00:54:54,791 --> 00:55:01,291
Oh! Then you can be sure
that she's roasting down there.

415
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,333
Is there no way to get her out?

416
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,500
Get her out?

417
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:11,958
Of Hell?

418
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:16,750
Little girl, you're very funny.

419
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:21,250
No one gets out of Hell.

420
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,833
Why not?

421
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:27,416
Because you condemn yourselves
during your lives.

422
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:35,500
You should see the lines of lost souls,
dragged along by their guilt,

423
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:40,125
without anyone forcing them,
waiting to get into Hell.

424
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:45,375
And once they've passed
through those gates,

425
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:48,416
there's no going back.

426
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:52,625
Things are as they are,
and they can't be changed.

427
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:57,250
One's fate is written.

428
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:05,791
He's lying.

429
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,375
He always lies.

430
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:12,875
Let's go.

431
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,583
I'll walk you to the crossroads.

432
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,000
There they are!

433
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,083
Usue!

434
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,833
Patxi, let the girl go.

435
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,541
Come here, Usue!

436
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,166
What did that monster do to you?

437
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,458
Nothing, I'm fine. I just fell.

438
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:22,208
You killed Lucas!

439
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,000
It was an accident.

440
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:26,875
Liar! You killed him with your own hands.

441
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,875
I saw it!

442
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:31,041
Grab him! He's a murderer!

443
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,291
Don't let him get away!

444
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,250
No!

445
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:02,833
Stop!

446
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:25,791
Mateo!

447
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,500
Patxi, don't fight them.

448
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,375
Don't make it worse.

449
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,208
We should search the smithy.

450
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:49,083
We'll have a look at your house.

451
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,458
The child is safe. I am glad.

452
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,500
You can go home and rest.

453
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:58,250
You can't search the smithy on your own.

454
00:58:58,333 --> 00:58:59,750
I'm well accompanied.

455
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:04,250
I appreciate your assistance,
but, please, let me do my work.

456
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:09,125
This is our town, and we're going,
like it or not. Come on!

457
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,791
Be careful! There are traps!

458
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:39,833
I know the girl is Maite's daughter,
but I always had doubts.

459
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:41,375
Is she his daughter, too?

460
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,291
No.

461
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:53,916
It was eight years ago.

462
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:59,916
I had commissioned a new bell
for the belfry from Patxi.

463
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:05,208
One night,
he came to my door with the bell...

464
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:07,250
What have you done, Patxi?

465
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:08,583
...and something else.

466
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:12,041
A newborn baby, Usue.

467
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:16,166
And then, he told me what had happened.

468
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:21,083
One month earlier,
after two years at the front,

469
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:25,458
he had deserted to return to his wife.

470
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:38,875
But when he came back,
he found a baby that was not his.

471
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:43,750
Maite thought that Patxi had died
in the war,

472
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:49,333
and she had found consolation
in another man's arms,

473
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:53,875
an outsider who got her with child.

474
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,208
Driven by an uncontrollable rage,

475
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:09,000
Patxi held the baby,
wanting to throw her into the fire.

476
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:20,041
But the father appeared and stopped Patxi.

477
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:26,125
Patxi, full of rage, killed him.

478
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:31,875
Maite tried to kill Patxi,
but the blacksmith escaped death.

479
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:39,333
Maite, lost in despair, killed herself.

480
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,500
Patxi told no one.

481
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,958
He shut himself in his workshop
and forged the bell I asked him for.

482
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:53,666
He brought the baby to me,

483
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,875
and none of us knew anything more of him
for months.

484
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,791
Come on, it's safe!

485
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,208
It's locked.

486
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,791
Please, wait here for a moment.

487
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:44,125
It might be dangerous. Bring the prisoner.

488
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,541
God!

489
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:45,875
The Dev... Dev... Devil... Are you real?

490
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:50,458
Come here, old man,
and I'll show you I'm real.

491
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:54,208
Holy God. Thank you, Lord.

492
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:56,791
Thank you for this gift.

493
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,125
You're the living proof of faith.

494
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,125
I'll take you to the Vatican

495
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:06,583
so that everyone can see the face of evil.

496
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:10,083
I'll be the hand of the Lord!

497
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,958
Yes! You get me out of here,

498
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:19,958
and I'll go wherever you want.
They'll make you Pope!

499
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:23,875
Silence, Beelzebub!
Your blasphemous words don't work with me.

500
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:28,916
I am not Beelzebub, you stupid old shit.

501
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,291
But I see clearly
what the price of your soul is,

502
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:37,166
and it isn't worth a fly.

503
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,500
I must ask you to go outside.

504
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,166
I have to question the accused.

505
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:49,291
Don't be ridiculous.
This is a Church matter.

506
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,500
It's a ministry matter.

507
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,208
I'm not moving from here.

508
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:56,250
The strength of the Lord is with me.

509
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:03,833
Miguel! What are you doing?

510
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,125
What you don't dare to do.

511
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,958
Go back under your wife's skirts.

512
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:12,875
What? Are you going to shoot me?

513
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:16,166
You heard him, old man!

514
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,208
Swine!

515
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,916
Please, wait outside.

516
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,416
Santi! The keys...

517
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:38,291
What happened?

518
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:41,958
The Devil... The Devil is in there.

519
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:43,250
I saw him, too.

520
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,625
Jesus!

521
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:45,708
What do we do?

522
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,875
I don't trust them.

523
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:51,583
What if they let him loose?
We can't allow that.

524
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:55,208
Goddamn dandy... And those idiots!

525
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:58,125
Come on! We have to go inside!

526
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,208
Come on!

527
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:00,750
Usue, help me.

528
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,291
Usue? Usue?

529
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:17,125
Forget about him
and tie up the blacksmith.

530
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,375
Find out where the gold is.

531
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,333
Where's the gold?

532
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,000
Hey!

533
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,750
Answer! Well?

534
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,625
What?

535
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:03,333
Bastard!

536
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:41,166
Listen, my friend,
do you want to make a deal?

537
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:46,333
I can tell you where the gold is,
but first, help me get out of here.

538
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,708
How embarrassing.

539
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:50,916
What?

540
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:54,333
Look at yourself, Sartael.

541
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:56,458
How do you know my name?

542
01:07:57,041 --> 01:08:01,083
You look like a chicken,
shut up in that cage.

543
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:08,125
Alastor? It's you!

544
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:13,000
By the tail of Belfegor!

545
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,750
You finally found me!

546
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:19,750
Come on, get me out of here,
and I can finish the job.

547
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,916
Little Sartael.

548
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:24,041
Alastor.

549
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,291
I haven't come for you.

550
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:29,583
I've come for the blacksmith's soul.

551
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:32,333
But I was asked to report
on your situation,

552
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:38,000
and to inform you that you've been demoted
for your negligence.

553
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,208
Demoted?

554
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:43,041
You're a disgrace to Hell.

555
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,375
You've shown your true form to the humans.

556
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,625
You've broken protocol,

557
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:52,500
you've intervened physically
in their lives,

558
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:54,250
and you let yourself be captured.

559
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:58,791
Everyone down below was wondering
where you'd got to.

560
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:01,625
And as you know,

561
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:05,416
our ministry never leaves loose ends.

562
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:10,041
Give me a bit more time and I'll fix it!

563
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,875
The decision has been made.

564
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,416
And how far have I been demoted?

565
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:21,333
Fifth Circle.

566
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:25,250
The sad and repressed section,
boiling pot 203.

567
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:28,583
No! No! No! No!

568
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:31,041
Not the Sad! Please!

569
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,958
It's obvious that tempting souls
isn't your forte.

570
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:38,000
It's beyond you.
Each one has his place.

571
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:43,250
It cannot be changed.
One's destiny is written.

572
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:50,666
As soon as I deliver the report,
they'll come for you.

573
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:56,125
Get me out of here somehow.

574
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:58,500
And be implicated in your incompetence?

575
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:02,791
Stay there and learn.

576
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:07,416
Observe those two:

577
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:13,541
how they do what I want, so obedient,
without them knowing who I really am.

578
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:30,833
Break the door down!
Set fire to it, if necessary.

579
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:34,875
Open the door! Open it, you bastards!

580
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,000
Usue!

581
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:45,916
That'll do.

582
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:48,583
Well?

583
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,708
Nothing.

584
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:54,000
It's obvious that he's guilty.

585
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,000
We have to hang him.

586
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,541
But he hasn't said where the gold is.

587
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,375
You'll still get paid.

588
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:03,375
I don't understand.
Weren't we here for the gold?

589
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,666
Do as I say!

590
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,541
-But--
-I said, hang him!

591
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:09,666
All right.

592
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,583
Here's a rope.

593
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:24,750
We can't break the door down.

594
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:44,208
Little girl!

595
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,166
Don't worry.

596
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,708
Do you want to help the blacksmith?

597
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:54,041
I can free him.

598
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,583
Yes.

599
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:59,791
And, as well, if you help me,

600
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:04,125
I swear I'll look for your mother
down below. I promise.

601
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:05,625
Please!

602
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:13,458
Just ring that damn bell.

603
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:18,875
I'll keep them occupied while you get it.

604
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:22,875
But then you have to help me
get out of here.

605
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:26,125
Eh, little girl? Is it a deal?

606
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:33,708
Oh, Great Lord!

607
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,416
You are right.

608
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,458
This isn't the job for me.

609
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:43,375
Who am I? How can I compare with you?

610
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,750
Oh, Hangman,

611
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:50,666
Grand Executioner
of the Infernal Monarch's sentences!

612
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,458
Ignore him. Finish off the prisoner.

613
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,500
Greater than Nemesis!

614
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:03,083
You're pathetic.
Your words won't change your fate.

615
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,708
Come on! Charge!

616
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,125
Again!

617
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,000
You! You're here?

618
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,750
Shake it!

619
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,208
Harder!

620
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,333
He's a monster! He's a monster!
He's a monster!

621
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:12,333
Little girl! Please! Get me out of here!

622
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:14,250
We had a deal!

623
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,625
You have to get out of here.

624
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,750
Hurry up!

625
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,041
Quickly, little girl, help me!

626
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:39,875
Hurry up!

627
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:45,708
No!

628
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:49,333
No!

629
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:57,125
I'm sorry, little girl,
but I'm never going back to Hell.

630
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:04,458
Get out of my way! Or I'll eat your souls!

631
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,291
Don't let him escape!

632
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,166
No! No! No! Not again!

633
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,833
Devil!

634
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:42,958
You! Damn the day
I took you into my house!

635
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:48,041
May the Devil take you to Hell
to join your whore of a mother!

636
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:11,583
You come from Hell, too, don't you?

637
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,166
Can you take me there, to my mother?

638
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,625
Usue, keep away from him!

639
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,166
Are you sure that's what you want?

640
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,625
I'll take you to your mother.

641
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,458
And you give me your soul in exchange.

642
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,333
Is it a deal?

643
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,666
No!

644
01:17:56,458 --> 01:18:01,500
Usue! My little Usue!

645
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,875
It was a demon.

646
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:16,125
He took her to Hell.

647
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,916
You win! Take me to Hell.

648
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:47,500
What? Now you want to go?

649
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:52,916
I'd rather be kicked by these idiots
than put up with you down there.

650
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:55,708
The other demon took the little girl.

651
01:18:56,625 --> 01:19:00,583
A pity. I liked her.

652
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,000
But that's not my problem.

653
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:07,750
You'd still be in that cage
if it wasn't for her.

654
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:10,375
You owe it to her.

655
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,041
Shit!

656
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:20,458
All right! But you'll go as my prisoner.

657
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:22,083
Then, let's go.

658
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:27,166
Wait. You can't go
with a stupid hand bell.

659
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:30,333
A bell.

660
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,916
The Carlist gold!

661
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:59,375
It was right in front of us all this time.

662
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:03,500
Santi, there's the gold.
This is our chance.

663
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,375
Do you want the same?

664
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:16,125
It'll work.

665
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,166
Can you carry it?

666
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,458
I suppose so.

667
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:36,958
Come on.

668
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:40,166
Do it.

669
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:43,208
I'm going to enjoy this.

670
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:06,875
What is this?

671
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,541
Guess.

672
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:09,250
Come on, forward!

673
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:12,125
Come on! Welcome!

674
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:23,500
I'm sorry, forgive me!

675
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,541
Why did I do it?

676
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:30,500
Come on! Go inside!

677
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:35,625
Move!

678
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:02,208
Welcome to Hell!

679
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,875
Get back!

680
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:22,291
Punish me!

681
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:26,625
Get back in line! Human garbage!

682
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,750
Yes, I'm scum.

683
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,583
Do as I tell you.

684
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:51,291
Sartael? Is that you?

685
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,291
Orobas...

686
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,625
Where have you been all this time?

687
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:59,208
You look terrible.

688
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:02,041
I heard you wouldn't be back.

689
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:06,458
No, no... A difficult soul.

690
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,333
That one there?

691
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:10,500
He doesn't look so tough.

692
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:14,708
Hey, you! What have you got there?

693
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,708
Stay where you are!

694
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:32,291
Hey! There's a soul here causing trouble.

695
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:53,125
Go back with Sartael!

696
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:21,250
Alastor!

697
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,541
I'm out of here!

698
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:52,166
Blacksmith!

699
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:56,916
Get in there!

700
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:58,791
I'm coming,

701
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:04,166
but first, count this.

702
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,333
A jar!

703
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:20,125
Big mistake!

704
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:26,375
Hey!

705
01:26:40,291 --> 01:26:42,500
Count them now!

706
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:07,708
One, two, three, four,

707
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:12,791
five, six, seven, eight,

708
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,791
nine, ten...

709
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,541
Don't close the gates! I'm garbage!

710
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:35,041
...twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,
twenty-three, twenty-four...

711
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:19,208
Sartael, get the girl out of here.

712
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:21,000
I'm staying.

713
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:25,708
You're mad! Others will be coming soon.

714
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:34,375
I'm going to look for your mother.

715
01:28:59,916 --> 01:29:01,458
Get out of here.

716
01:29:46,791 --> 01:29:48,750
Let's go before I change my mind.

717
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:31,958
Usue! My Lord Jesus!

718
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:34,666
Thank you, Lord!

719
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,125
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

720
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:38,666
Yokels!

721
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:44,083
This child is a saint,
and they've thrown her out of Hell.

722
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:46,666
Don't ever send her there again

723
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:53,458
or I will eat your thumbs while you sleep.

724
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:58,416
Goodbye!

725
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:17,333
Are you all right?

726
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,625
Thank you, good man.

727
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,375
Don't mention it, friend.

728
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:32,875
May I ask what happened to you?

729
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:35,916
You wouldn't believe it.

730
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:42,333
It's a long way to the next town.
And I love a good story.

731
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:46,291
Well, I know a good one.

732
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:48,166
I'm all ears.

733
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,166
This story, like many others,

734
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:56,500
begins with a man of flesh and blood...

735
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:03,250
Let me in!

736
01:33:17,583 --> 01:33:23,041
A man so evil, so cruel,

737
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:29,458
that even the Devil himself
would fear him.

738
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:33,083
A blacksmith.

739
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:39,958
And whether it was so or not,

740
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:45,208
get into the pumpkin
and out at the square.

741
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:56,000
BASED ON J.M. BARANDIARAN'S SHORT STORY
"PATXI ERREMENTARIA"

742
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:36,291
THE END
