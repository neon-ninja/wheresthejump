00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,436
Yes.

3
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:30,712
You failed.

4
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:31,879
I didn't.

5
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,983
The gun is in my hand.

6
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,553
I thought I had it.

7
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,924
Sorry, Father.
I'll make it next time.

8
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,258
Never take anything
for granted.

9
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,895
God will take it from you.

10
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,165
Is God bad?

11
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:55,770
God is fair.

12
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,409
You almost got
me, didn't you, boy?

13
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,932
Did I get my white hair from you

14
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,266
or from Mom?

15
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,337
From your mother.

16
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,406
I can't believe we don't have
any pictures of her.

17
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,676
Everything was destroyed
in the fire.

18
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,344
You know that.

19
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,213
I could only save you.

20
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,119
Was she beautiful?

21
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,726
She was smart.

22
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,663
Like you.

23
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,132
How many did I get?

24
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,634
All of them.

25
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,106
So I get to go
to town today, right?

26
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:09,644
You failed survival.

27
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,247
It's been three months.

28
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,085
Plus, I just gave you
a killer haircut.

29
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,787
Trust me.

30
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,592
You need to pass
all your tests first.

31
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,507
All right,
apart from the usual,

32
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,210
I have an order of
five ferns,

33
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,511
two ficuses,

34
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,013
and the <i>Columnea grandiosa.</i>

35
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,348
<i>Gloriosa.</i>

36
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,450
<i>Gloriosa.</i>

37
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:52,352
Am I taking Phoenix today?

38
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,521
Not today.

39
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,355
It's been a while.

40
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,757
I said, no.

41
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,030
You either loosen up
that leash,

42
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,600
or sooner or later,
she's gonna bite it off.

43
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:20,982
Go with Hernandez.

44
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,188
Back by sunset!

45
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,589
I will.

46
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,295
Hey, Hernandez.

47
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,130

I think my mom sang it to me

85
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,218
I need to pee.

I don't care.

97
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,600

Wow.

00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,816
Okay.

00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,770

106
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,613
You okay?

107
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,680
Yes.

108
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,348
Just a weirdo.

109
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,317
Yeah.

110
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,020
No shortage of those
around here.

111
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,168
Follow them.

112
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,548
Thanks, Hernandez.

113
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,083
We had a lot of fun today.

114
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,520
I'll take her again next week
if you're okay with it.

115
00:11:58,653 --> 00:11:59,887
No.

116
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,455
Today was enough.

117
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,030
- It's none of my business, but...
- You're right.

118
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,601
It's not.

119
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,071
You're a bad man.

120
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,042
A man who's done
terrible things.

121
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,517
At least, I know you think that.

122
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,952
Just like sometimes
I do about myself.

123
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,757
War changes us all.

124
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,728
No soul returns holy from it.

125
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,397
Don't make her pay for that.

126
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,670
Thanks.

127
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:04,679
You mind moving your vehicle
off the road, please?

128
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:06,213
This is...

129
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,251
This is the only road
back to town.

130
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:13,688
You served?

131
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:15,389
Yeah.

132
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:16,791
We all did too.

133
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,027
- Iraq?
- Yeah.

134
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,231
Dishonorably discharged
from a dishonorable war.

135
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:30,672
I'd say that makes us
honorable somehow. Wouldn't you?

136
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,072
No.

137
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:37,044
Can you move your truck
off the road now?

138
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,517
Sure, baby.

139
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,719
Whatever you want.

140
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,694
Lessons next month.

141
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,162
Okay.

142
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,767
I wanna go to school next year.

143
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,001
- This is school...
- A real school,

144
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,470
with other kids like me.

145
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,138
Homeschool is safer.

146
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,106
I don't wanna be safe.

147
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,976
I wanna be normal.
I wanna have friends.

148
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,445
- I wanna live a...
- Enough!

149
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,814
Enough.

150
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:24,284
I already lost a daughter once.

151
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,053
I'm not losing you.

152
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,789
But I'm lonely.

153
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:32,259
You have no idea
what it is to be alone.

154
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,530
You have me.

155
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,001
You're not enough.

Shadow?

160
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:41,615
Shadow.

161
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,023
Oh, God.

162
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:54,048
The box! Now!

163
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,917
Go!

164
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,436
Go get the girl.

165
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:31,819
Open the door.

166
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:34,623
Open up!

167
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,437
What the fuck?

168
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:04,838
Oh!

169
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:09,310
Hang on, brother.

170
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,458
Open your jaw.

171
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:27,194
Stay still.

172
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:32,801
Breathe, brother.

173
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:52,821
The guy's a Navy SEAL.

174
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,903
Fucking dead SEAL, bro.

175
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:12,534
Better get out of there, kid.

176
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,947
He's down there with you!

177
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,818
Blind fuck is down there!

178
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,503
Call Raylan.

179
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:26,875
Metal box
is almost full of water.

180
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,913
You prefer
to see the kid alive...

181
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,016
you come in here.

182
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,522
You think I'm fucking with you?

183
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,426
No.

184
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:50,932
There's a live wire
about to reach the water.

185
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,934
Come out, or she's fried!

186
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,918
Clever fuck.

187
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:12,419
No guns, huh?

188
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:15,023
No problem.

189
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:51,913
You're tough.

190
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,016
But you're done.

191
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,029
What the fuck?

192
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:09,564
Yo, bro.

193
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:30,645
Breathe.

194
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:31,979
Come on, breathe.

195
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:35,016
Breathe.

196
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:36,349
Breathe.

197
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,725
The old blind man did this?

198
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,326
Uh-huh.

199
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:50,363
Let's go.

200
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,649
I can walk.

201
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:10,251
I said, I can walk.

202
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:14,856
What's happening?

203
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:27,668
Cover the exits.

204
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:42,083
What the fuck?

205
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,245
They're still down here.

206
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:42,977
What's happening?

207
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,580
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

208
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:33,627
You don't need to be
afraid, little girl.

209
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,699
This has all just been
one big misunderstanding.

210
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:52,513
It's not me
you need to be scared of...

211
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,522
but the man
standing next to you.

212
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:06,394
Now, I don't know who he is.

213
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:11,165
But I know who he's not.

214
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,809
Should I tell her or you?

215
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,918
Finish him, bro.

216
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:32,686
No!

217
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,923
- Dad! Dad, wake up.
- Aren't you something?

218
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,592
Let me go!

219
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:41,762
Come on.

220
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:43,764
No, it's okay.

221
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:49,703
Yeah, there you go.

222
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:52,073
There you go.

223
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:54,442
You really don't remember me,
do you?

224
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:57,578
Maybe this will help.

225
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,390
See?

226
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,496
What...?

227
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,268
Years ago, there was
a fire in our house.

228
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,471
Cops blamed me.

229
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:24,972
I spent eight years in prison,

230
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:26,974
wondering if
I'd ever see you again.

231
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:33,247
I didn't even know
if you were dead or alive.

232
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:40,988
<i>This creep here must have...</i>

233
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:42,990
<i>found you
and kept you for himself.</i>

234
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:46,595
<i>Up next in local news,</i>

235
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:49,730
<i>a meth lab caught fire
in west Detroit this morning.</i>

236
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:52,500
<i>Police were able
to arrest the primary suspect.</i>

237
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:55,504
<i>The man was taken into custody
and could face charges</i>

238
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:57,371
<i>for a large number of crimes
committed</i>

239
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:00,007
- <i>over the past several years.</i>
- <i>You have no idea</i>

240
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:02,776
<i>how much I've been waiting
for this moment.</i>

241
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,561
Did he hurt you?

242
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,464
But he did steal you
away from me,

243
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:25,534
and now he must die,
you understand?

244
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,303
Kill him.

245
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,438
- No.
- Fuck are you doing?

246
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:34,108
Not in front of my kid.
Do it outside.

247
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:42,449
Wake up, you blind fuck.

248
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:46,687
Oh! Fuck!

249
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,444
Fucking coward.

250
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,887
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker.

251
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,722
Let's go.

252
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:29,997
- Let me go!
- What's wrong with you?

253
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,398
Fucking wanna go home?

254
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,260
I don't care who you are.

255
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:02,096
I'm gonna teach you
some fucking manners, yo.

256
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:05,165
You ungrateful, little bitch.

257
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,285
No.

258
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,161
Stop.

259
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:36,096
Please!

260
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,898
Stop!

261
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,616
Move. Go, go.

262
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:56,785
Move. Now.

263
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:26,246
Move!

264
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:40,160
I'm sorry, man.

265
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,898
- He's back in the house.
- I know.

266
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:47,000
He wants us to follow him.

267
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:51,305
Enough of these silly games.

268
00:48:08,757 --> 00:48:10,257
It's his jacket.

269
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,561
Attaboy.

270
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,596
Attaboy.

271
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:17,599
Wait.

272
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:18,932
Stop.

273
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:22,537
Is it true?

274
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:23,738
Move.

275
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,305
What's my real name?

276
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:26,641
Get over here now!

277
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:28,108
When's my birthday?

278
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,110
- My real one?
- Stop it!

279
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:31,546
No, you stop it!

280
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:42,956
Go!

281
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,359
Hey.

282
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:14,042
Phoenix!

283
00:51:14,174 --> 00:51:16,911
Calm down, girl.

284
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:20,615
Calm down.

285
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:42,102
Stay.

286
00:51:57,585 --> 00:51:59,119
Put her in the truck.

287
00:52:22,644 --> 00:52:24,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

288
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,215
What are you doing?

289
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,852
- Your dog's in there.
- Dog's dead.

290
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:32,520
You don't know that.

291
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:34,522
You wanna go and find out?

292
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:32,914
No!

293
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,757
Good morning, princess.

294
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:39,466
How you feeling?

295
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:45,706
You all right?

296
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:49,076
Wanna sit with me?

297
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:52,713
Come, sit with me. Come on.

298
00:56:54,048 --> 00:56:55,950
Yeah.

299
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,585
There you go.

300
00:56:57,718 --> 00:56:58,753
There you go.

301
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:01,188
Yeah.

302
00:57:07,595 --> 00:57:08,896
Door's open.

303
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:11,899
Not a prisoner anymore.

304
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:16,270
You mean, I can go?

305
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:19,307
If you want.

306
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,077
Or you can stay here

307
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,079
and find out
who you really are.

308
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:35,823
Do I have
any brothers or sisters?

309
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:40,027
Unfortunately, no.

310
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:44,332
When's my birthday?

311
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:45,866
February 20th.

312
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:50,037
What was my mother's name?

313
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,507
Josephine.

314
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,310
Do I look like her?

315
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:00,948
Yeah.

316
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:04,919
You do.

317
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:08,488
Tara.

318
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:11,158
That's your real name.

319
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,095
Tara.

320
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,932
Everything that man
told you is a lie.

321
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:20,701
What happened to him?

322
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:23,537
He got what he deserved.

323
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:28,709
Hey. I'm not sorry.

324
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:30,745
You shouldn't be either.

325
00:58:30,878 --> 00:58:32,146
I wanna go.

326
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:35,249
Where? Where you gonna go?

327
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:37,485
There's a shelter I know.

328
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:40,554
Like I said,

329
00:58:40,688 --> 00:58:42,490
you're not a prisoner anymore.

Like I said...

345
01:01:22,617 --> 01:01:24,285
everything he told you
was a lie.

346
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,365
My Tara?

347
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:44,872
You...

348
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:47,676
got so big, heh.

349
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:53,180
Can I hug you?

350
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,754
Come here.

351
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:03,924
Oh, God.

352
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,529
Oh, God.

353
01:02:10,699 --> 01:02:12,766
Mmm. Oh, God.

354
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:16,737
Oh, baby, we missed you so much.

355
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:24,111
Mmm...

356
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:25,547
There you are.

357
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,851
You were
such a beautiful baby.

358
01:02:40,361 --> 01:02:41,895
Get it out.

359
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:44,431
Get it out. Come on.

360
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:47,669
There you go.
There you go. There you go.

361
01:02:47,801 --> 01:02:49,970
- Sorry.
- Nothing to apologize for.

362
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:54,008
Are you okay?

363
01:02:57,077 --> 01:03:00,615
The same fire
that destroyed our family...

364
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:05,286
it burned up my insides.

365
01:03:09,857 --> 01:03:12,793
Mom and Dad used to have a...

366
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,600
kitchen, heh...

367
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:20,735
in the basement of our house,

368
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:23,772
where we used to cook.

369
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:29,910
It was for our business.

370
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:35,684
Are you thirsty?

371
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:51,566
Tara?

372
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:54,803
I'm dying.

373
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:56,036
What?

374
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:00,742
The smoke from the chemicals...

375
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:04,546
poisoned my blood
and badly damaged my heart.

376
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:07,515
I don't think
I have much time left.

377
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:09,483
Is there anything you can do?

378
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:22,564
I heard you left flowers for me
at our old house.

379
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,334
Is that true?

380
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:32,039
Oh.

381
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:34,709
Weren't you wishing

382
01:04:34,843 --> 01:04:39,748
your mama
was healthy and alive?

383
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,115
Yes.

384
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:56,564
I need a new heart, baby.

385
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,868
But not just any heart.

386
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,404
Doctor said
it has to be a, uh...

387
01:05:03,538 --> 01:05:05,472
It must be a...

388
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,743
compatible donor.

389
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,082
Like a direct relative.

390
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:20,588
You hold the gift
that can save your mama's life.

391
01:05:24,893 --> 01:05:27,729
And, baby, I need that gift.

392
01:05:46,748 --> 01:05:49,818
We'll finally
be together as one.

393
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:56,624
You'll live on in me.

394
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:26,487
Go home.

395
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:22,036
Go away.

396
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:24,237
I said, go.

397
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:33,480
Stay.

398
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:37,919
Stay.

399
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,385
Go home.

400
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,495
Go home.

401
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:03,871
I hope you understand

402
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:06,206
the high risks
of this procedure.

403
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,209
I think I pay you enough.

404
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:11,244
Shut up and do your job.

405
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:14,448
Why is she still alive?

406
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:18,218
If she's dead, so is her heart.

407
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:21,556
And I can't keep it fresh
long enough

408
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:24,826
without the proper equipment.

409
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:27,895
I have to cut it out of her
while she's still breathing.

410
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:31,666
Hey.

411
01:10:31,799 --> 01:10:33,266
Hey, hey, hey.

412
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,203
Hey, hey.

413
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:39,874
<i>Thank you.</i>

414
01:11:00,293 --> 01:11:02,295
What's wrong with you, man?

415
01:11:03,631 --> 01:11:05,800
What they're doing
in there is wrong.

416
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:09,070
She's our cook.

417
01:11:10,538 --> 01:11:13,508
If she dies,
there's no product.

418
01:11:13,641 --> 01:11:15,977
If there's no product,
there's no us.

419
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:19,647
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

420
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,718
Still fucking wrong.

421
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:32,894
Hey.

422
01:11:34,394 --> 01:11:36,664
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

423
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,635
Let's go.

424
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:05,827
What the fuck?

425
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,333
Go check it out.

426
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:26,113
Hm.

427
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:32,580
You killed my brother!

428
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:36,017
You blind freak!

429
01:13:58,372 --> 01:14:02,276
I'm gonna carve your fucking
head open like a pumpkin, man.

430
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:00,601
This is for Shadow.

431
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:03,671
Oh, fuck.

432
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:05,039
No!

433
01:15:11,879 --> 01:15:13,314
It's him.

434
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,821
How the hell did he find...?

435
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,475
Disloyal fucking animal.

436
01:15:41,609 --> 01:15:43,512
Is everything okay?

437
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:47,481
Yeah, everything's okay.

438
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:50,551
- Everything's okay, I promise.
- Baby, should I be worried?

439
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:52,319
No, no. Not at all.

440
01:15:52,453 --> 01:15:53,821
I got you. I got you.

441
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:56,490
I can't work without power.

442
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:57,691
Uh...

443
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:01,195
Change of plans, then.

444
01:16:01,328 --> 01:16:03,197
Pack your things.
Bring the girl.

445
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,565
Raul.

446
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,768
Bring the men.
Kill the blind man.

447
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:11,572
- How many of us?
- All of you!

448
01:16:14,509 --> 01:16:15,609
Let's go.

449
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:50,471
They're gonna kill her.

450
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:56,677
And that's not cool with me.

451
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:01,715
They're leaving now.

452
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:03,017
The ladder behind you

453
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,685
leads directly to them.

454
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:06,420
You'd better hurry.

455
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:21,902
Go left.

456
01:18:23,037 --> 01:18:24,305
That way.

457
01:18:27,676 --> 01:18:29,210
He'll kill you all.

458
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:39,920
Fuck it. I'm out.

459
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:42,323
Hey, hey! Hey!

460
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,517
Good morning, motherfucker.

461
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:16,591
- Baby.
- Shh, shh. It's okay.

462
01:19:16,725 --> 01:19:18,892
Stop it.

463
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:52,860
Baby?

464
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:55,496
Hello?

465
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,264
I can't see you.

466
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:07,941
Baby?

467
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:42,644
I'm over here! Where are you?

468
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:45,279
Baby?

469
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:11,038
I got you, motherfucker.

470
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:23,718
No.

471
01:21:23,852 --> 01:21:27,187
No! No!

472
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:36,130
No.

473
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:39,634
No!

474
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,086
Phoenix!

475
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:08,255
Now...

476
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:10,290
you're gonna see

477
01:23:10,424 --> 01:23:12,292
what I see.

478
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:03,912
Phoenix?

479
01:24:14,488 --> 01:24:16,123
Stop.

480
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,892
Oh, stop!

481
01:24:20,995 --> 01:24:22,362
You...

482
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:26,901
You mustn't come near me.

483
01:24:33,007 --> 01:24:36,945
Everything he said...

484
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:41,281
is true.

485
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:50,290
I am no father.

486
01:24:55,063 --> 01:24:57,364
I have killed.

487
01:25:03,004 --> 01:25:04,104
I...

488
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:06,708
have raped.

489
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:09,043
I...

490
01:25:12,412 --> 01:25:13,915
am nothing.

491
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:20,888
Nothing...

492
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:24,592
but a monster.

493
01:25:30,765 --> 01:25:32,432
And you...

494
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:34,636
cannot be around me.

495
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:37,471
Ever.

496
01:25:39,774 --> 01:25:40,675
So go.

497
01:25:44,277 --> 01:25:45,680
Now. Go.

498
01:25:47,015 --> 01:25:48,215
Go!

499
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,315
Oh, God.

500
01:27:12,066 --> 01:27:13,034
Tara?

501
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:38,893
No.

502
01:27:40,728 --> 01:27:43,330
No. No.

503
01:27:47,769 --> 01:27:48,669
Please.

504
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:55,777
No, no, no.

505
01:27:57,477 --> 01:27:58,846
Let me help you.

506
01:28:00,715 --> 01:28:02,282
I can save you.

507
01:28:08,055 --> 01:28:09,991
You already have.

508
01:29:55,096 --> 01:29:56,530
Hey.

509
01:29:58,232 --> 01:29:59,267
Hey.

510
01:30:00,668 --> 01:30:02,536
Think there's room for one more?

511
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:05,139
I'm sure there is.

512
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:08,609
What's your name?

513
01:30:13,047 --> 01:30:14,715
My name is Phoenix.
