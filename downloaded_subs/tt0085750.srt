1
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,408
(Crunch)

2
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,085
(Highest girl) Come on, slow poke!

3
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:17,465
Don't lean forward!
Don't lean forward!

4
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:20,463
(Laughing)

5
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,592
(Man) Come on, Overman.
Give us a break, will you?

6
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:35,974
Look at the clown
in the jockey shorts!

7
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,847
Kelly, come on. Pay attention.

8
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:39,854
Hey, girls!

9
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:43,931
Do it like this! Ooh!

10
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,781
(Man) Damn it, Kelly! Do the job!

11
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:56,612
Next time we're goin'
right into the lagoon.

12
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,150
The lagoon is my favourite! (Laughs)

13
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:07,245
Damn boat.
I flooded the... Damn boat!

14
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,162
(Girl) Come on, Richie.
I got a date tonight!

15
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:12,038
(Skier) Through the gate!

16
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,501
(Richie) Come on, baby.

17
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,009
OK, guys, here we go.

18
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,426
Oh! That's right. Good.

19
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:42,811
(Woman) You've been chosen
for your neatness,

20
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:46,309
courtesy toward others
and your Southern grace.

21
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:50,936
We enforce our dress code here,
so keep your hair and nails trimmed.

22
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:53,657
And, please,
don't alter your costumes.

23
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:56,818
Once you've got your Sea World
guide apparel,

24
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:59,237
the shorts are short enough.

25
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:00,482
(Girl giggles)

26
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:04,119
Show any cheek and you'll be back
shovellin' french fries.

27
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:05,195
(Girls giggling)

28
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:10,369
Now, let's continue with our welcome
speech again. All together now.

29
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:12,623
(All) Welcome to Sea World,

30
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:15,789
the world's largest marine life park.

31
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:20,332
Above and below the surface
of our unique Undersea Kingdom...

32
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:24,005
(Man) The park opens on Saturday.

33
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:27,799
All this week has been,
and continues to be, preview week,

34
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:31,889
during which family and friends
attend Sea World as our guests.

35
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,174
This is the Undersea Kingdom,

36
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:38,435
four years under construction,
at a cost of more than $34 million.

37
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,261
Four pressurised viewing tunnels
radiate out into the lagoon.

38
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:46,358
There's the Sunken Spanish Galleon,
Jonah's Marine Fun House,

39
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:50,646
the Deepwater Coral Forest,
all connected to Central Control.

40
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:54,941
And a deluxe restaurant and lounge,
all 4O feet below the surface.

41
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,659
The complex is built
in our manmade lagoon,

42
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:00,486
which connects to the ocean
by a deep channel.

43
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:03,653
The new additions to Sea World
are the brainchild

44
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:06,324
of entrepreneur Calvin Bouchard.

45
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,083
(Kelly) Hi, guys!

46
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,332
(Girl) Now you can close the gate.

47
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,421
(Gate motor whirring)

48
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:37,299
(Thud)

49
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,511
(Man) Jesus!

50
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:43,267
Overman, I thought you said
those tracks were secure.

51
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:45,637
Hey, I welded
the damn thing myself.

52
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,013
(Worker) Something's
hung the gate up.

53
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,935
(2nd worker) Better get Brody.
He'll be pissed.

54
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:52,479
Whoo!

55
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:55,278
(Guy) Here's the lagoon.
Set up for the turn.

56
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:58,689
(PR man) I call your attention
to the Sea World skiers,

57
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,364
who are entering the lagoon

58
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:02,981
in a preview
of the opening day ceremonies.

59
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,572
(Reporters chattering, indistinct)

60
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:07,659
Here come my pride and joy.

61
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:11,825
(Female reporter)
Can we talk to Mr Bouchard?

62
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:15,077
- Beautiful. Just beautiful!
- (Girl skier) Hi!

63
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:17,082
(Man)... this exciting complex.

64
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:21,622
We WOULD like to avoid
references to his colourful past.

65
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:25,005
(Woman) Did the Undersea Kingdom
really cost $30 million?

66
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:26,923
Aren't those kids great?

67
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:30,799
Mr Bouchard, is there anything
special goin' on openin' day?

68
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:35,172
Well, this afternoon, at the main
gate, we'll be pleased to announce...

69
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:37,844
the welcomin' of Mr Philip FitzRoyce.

70
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,930
Oh, really? Is that true?

71
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:43,557
No lie, he gonna be here.
Now, we got drinks at the bar.

72
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,394
They free. Come on, follow me.

73
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:46,552
(Reporters laugh)

74
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:54,861
- What's it look like?
- It's off the track.

75
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:58,652
- How'd that happen?
- I can't tell, but she is jammed.

76
00:07:58,698 --> 00:08:00,524
Just wouldn't close, Mike.

77
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:02,316
(Overman) Now what do we do?

78
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:05,817
Somethin' knocked the
son-of-a-bitch right off the track.

79
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,074
Just secure the damn gate, all right?

80
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:11,121
- Think you can handle that?
- On overtime, maybe.

81
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,156
You got enough overtime.

82
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,744
- Your party.
- You buy the beer, Brody.

83
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,535
Well, look, you're in charge.

84
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:20,750
See you guys later.
I got more important things to do.

85
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:25,087
- No overtime.
- OK. See you, Mike.

86
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:27,801
(Shouting) No overtime!

87
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,878
(All shouting, laughing) No overtime!

88
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,344
(Dolphins clicking)

89
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,510
(Clicking loudly)

90
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,596
(Clicking continues)

91
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:57,610
(Dolphins clicking, cage rattling)

92
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,609
Hi, Mike.

93
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,778
- Oh. Ah. Hey, Dan.
- Hey.

94
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,284
Havin' gate problems?

95
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,651
The dolphins tried
to open them again.

96
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:12,028
- Where's the boss?
- Up with Shamu.

97
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,358
Thanks.

98
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:16,990
(Woman) Come on, Cindy.

99
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:20,410
Come on, Sandy. Come on.

100
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:23,874
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey. Come on.

101
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:26,791
It's the boss hard hat.
Where's your boots?

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,247
I only wear 'em to bed
and in the shower.

103
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,872
- Where's Kay?
- She's down that way.

104
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:46,137
Yee-hah! Ride 'em, cowgirl.

105
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,262
- Hi, Mike!
- Hey!

106
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:52,681
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- All right.

107
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,605
Use your spurs.

108
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,105
Hey, Liz!

109
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:06,656
Good boy. That was nice!

110
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:09,236
- Hey.
- Hey!

111
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:16,373
Liz, he did that great. I don't wanna
do it again. Do me a favour.

112
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,249
Put Cindy and Sandy
in the lagoon for a run.

113
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,117
OK.

114
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,456
- How you doin'?
- Great.

115
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,494
Hey, you. Come here.

116
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:27,253
(Shamu squeaks)

117
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:31,080
Come here, kiddo.
That's the feeding place.

118
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:36,708
- Is this whale house-broken yet?
- Nope.

119
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,094
- Then he can't come to dinner.
- You takin' me to dinner?

120
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,845
Soon as we pick up my brother.

121
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,348
When's Sean coming?

122
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,799
We're gonna meet him
at the main gate.

123
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,130
(Dan) Kathy.

124
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,685
Cindy and Sandy don't wanna go.

125
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,647
Am I gonna lose you
to a couple of neurotic fish?

126
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,812
- Mammals.
- Mammals. Mammals.

127
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:57,814
(Dan) Something's bugging 'em.

128
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:02,068
It's play time. They'll be
beggin' us tomorrow. Put 'em up.

129
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,522
You got it.

130
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:06,607
- I'm begging you tonight.
- You don't have to beg.

131
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,032
Take me to dinner!

132
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:10,030
All right. Let's try sushi.

133
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:12,399
- Mike!
- I'll change.

134
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,941
Come here. Who's a good boy?

135
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:17,699
Are you a good boy?
Yes, you're a good boy.

136
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:18,825
(Shamu gurgles)

137
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:21,873
And you get a fish.

138
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:25,119
(Calvin) Ladies and gentlemen,
here he is now.

139
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:33,046
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Philip
FitzRoyce, with a capital R,

140
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:38,083
is here to film us, meet our resident
day scientific staff.

141
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:44,346
- Hey, what's this?
- Oh, no.

142
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,547
Philip the Great.

143
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,636
I am able to combine
business with pleasure,

144
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:53,303
which, they tell me, is the secret
to a long and happy life.

145
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:56,270
- What, FitzRoyce?
- Mmm.

146
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,555
Sure is.

147
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:01,941
Any further questions,
in the bar, if you please.

148
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,776
For the first one who buys.

149
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,567
- Look at Calvin. Best of buddies.
- Ah, best of friends.

150
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:09,861
(Mike) A regular Barnum and Bailey.

151
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,942
(Kay) I'm sure they'll
be very happy together.

152
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:16,111
Perfect.
Into the Undersea Kingdom they go.

153
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:17,785
(Chuckle)

154
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,573
Hey, Mikey!

155
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,242
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Oh!

156
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,413
- How you doin'?
- All right!

157
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,624
- My brother, the cowboy.
- Hey! Hug me, huh?

158
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:29,294
- Oh, OK.
- Hey.

159
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:31,292
(Kay shrieks)

160
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:35,169
You put on weight, you need a shave
and you're too tall.

161
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,422
Well, two out of three I can fix.

162
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:40,633
(Laughs) Get that gear
and let's go. Come on.

163
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,176
- So, nice boots.
- Thanks! Aw, gee.

164
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,298
How'd you do on your finals?

165
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,048
Great. A gentleman's "C,"
an incomplete, but I aced Phys Ed.

166
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,760
- (Kay) A real Einstein.
- Glad you're here.

167
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,644
(Thud)

168
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:17,191
(Thud)

169
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,621
There you go, Charlene.

170
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:34,452
- (Man) Shelby showed up yet?
- (2nd man) Haven't seen him.

171
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:36,246
(Woman) What are they doing?

172
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:39,047
(Man) Kelly's really
gettin' this one down.

173
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:43,170
(Woman) See that big guy? He gets
knocked on his ass every time.

174
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,175
(Woman laughs)

175
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,752
- All right, Charlene.
- All right!

176
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:52,340
Here, let me help you out.
Work with me, work with me.

177
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,718
Let's go.

178
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,436
- There we go.
- Wait. One more.

179
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,385
- Hey, Mike.
- All right. Yeah?

180
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:00,593
Is Shelby workin' overtime?

181
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:03,563
Not on my say-so.
He was supposed to knock off.

182
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:05,432
Have you met my kid brother?

183
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:08,649
If he's messin' with that bitch
at the souvenir stand,

184
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:10,235
it's gonna be his ass.

185
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:13,611
- You tell him.
- Charlene, I'm not his mother.

186
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:16,609
- You're his boss.
- Yeah, ask Woodbury, OK?

187
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,401
(Man) Come on, Kelly. You can do it!

188
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,528
- They're playing stand-off.
- Uh-oh.

189
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:31,158
My brother considers himself the
stand-off champion of New England.

190
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,081
And the western states.

191
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:35,876
- Go get 'em.
- (Growls)

192
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,624
(Whooping, laughter)

193
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,423
Hey, I wasn't ready!

194
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,509
I tell you, it's a game of balance.
I told you he'd fall on his ass.

195
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:50,637
(Man) Hey, who's this guy?

196
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,806
This is for beers. You buyin'?

197
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:58,759
Ready?

198
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,944
My fly's open. (Chuckles)

199
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,775
(Bystanders gasping)

200
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:22,945
- No fair!
- (Guy) Whooo!

201
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,235
Well, it's, uh...

202
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:29,070
not only a game of balance,
it's a game of deception.

203
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:33,581
Come on, I'll buy you two
and the one you owe me.

204
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,867
- OK.
- All right.

205
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,084
(Bystander) All right.
(Girl) See you later, Kelly.

206
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,962
Hey, I want you.
Come on, right now! Let's go.

207
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:46,592
- Kathryn, Mike.
- (Mike) Hi.

208
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:49,717
- You know each other?
- I see my brother nailed you.

209
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:51,551
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

210
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,929
Without that old crotch trick,
he'd never have won.

211
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:57,891
- That's his best move.
- Runs in the family.

212
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,592
Well, it worked.

213
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,177
- What are we drinkin'?
- Champagne of the working classes.

214
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,643
- Beer. You owe me a couple.
- That's right. Comin' up.

215
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,689
Two beers.
So, you work at the park, huh?

216
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,567
- Mm-hmm. I'm a water skier.
- Oh.

217
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:15,563
(Laughs) Your brother's cute.

218
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:20,521
Yeah. Him and Kathryn have, uh, been
together for a year and a half.

219
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,399
How about you?

220
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:26,273
Desperately unattached.

221
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,899
Lonely, confused.

222
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:33,862
Generous and loving to a fault.
It's all in my eyes.

223
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,657
(Man) Come on.
(2nd man) OK.

224
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,998
We'll cop a lot of
good stuff tonight.

225
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:42,416
- I've got the tanks.
- Shh!

226
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:45,166
- Is the van OK here?
- Yes, it's OK.

227
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:49,260
We're off Sea World property.
Nobody uses this road.

228
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,671
Shh!

229
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:57,381
Yeah.

230
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,548
Yeah.

231
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,051
Climb over the fence,
and take it easy with the raft.

232
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,430
(Clatter)

233
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,103
(Whispering) Damn it!

234
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,056
You asshole.

235
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:12,977
Now we gotta drag it
all the way down to the water!

236
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:17,233
- Ready to go?
- OK. Who's payin'?

237
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,407
Ah.

238
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:40,576
- Watch out. Snakes.
- Oh, come on. Don't bullshit me.

239
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:42,536
Chicken, huh?

240
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:51,793
- (Croaks)
- (Man gasps)

241
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:54,630
All right, steady.

242
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:57,464
- Steady.
- Got it.

243
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,588
OK. Here we go.

244
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,047
- Come on, paddle!
- I am.

245
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,633
Let's go out to the centre.

246
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,808
I sure hope this is worth it.

247
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:16,358
- (Laughing)
- (Mike groaning)

248
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:19,816
- Hey, Kelly, is this your car?
- Sure is.

249
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:22,067
Hey. Get off of there!

250
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:24,271
(Moaning, groaning)

251
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:26,528
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:29,242
Hey, what about baby brother?

253
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:31,572
- Aww!
- Aww!

254
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,612
Little baby brother.

255
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:37,363
Kelly, can you give him a ride home,
or shall I call his mommy?

256
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:41,282
- Nah, if he'll come quietly.
- No way. I scream and shout.

257
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:43,955
Oh, God, it stinks out here.
Let's get away!

258
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:47,002
- See ya.
- Hey, let's go swimming.

259
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:51,671
- N-no, I hate the ocean.
- Aww! Hey, I've got a better idea.

260
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:55,001
- Like lagoons?
- Lagoons?

261
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,672
- Lagoons.
- (She laughs)

262
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:58,965
(Engine starts)

263
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:08,016
Oh. How come Sean
doesn't visit more?

264
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:10,100
- He hates the water.
- What?

265
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:16,227
Yeah. Remember that shark attack I
told you about when we were in Amity?

266
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:19,690
Well, that's why he goes
to school in Colorado.

267
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:23,270
If our parents didn't live
on an island, he'd never get wet.

268
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,025
- (She laughs)
- My dad, he's the same way.

269
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:30,607
God, I love this place.

270
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,654
I hated it when we first came here.

271
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:36,660
What's the matter?

272
00:20:38,957 --> 00:20:41,198
Did you get a telephone call?

273
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,868
Venezuela?

274
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:50,538
Guess I'm gonna have to start
learning Spanish.

275
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:53,923
- Ooh, baby.
- Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:57,750
That's wonderful. That's wonderful.

277
00:20:57,803 --> 00:20:59,759
Oh, shit.

278
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:03,135
Reality.

279
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,472
How long?

280
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,090
Just a short year and a half.

281
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,601
I'd love you to come, you know.

282
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:18,605
Yeah.

283
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:24,516
But what about the six months
I've got left here

284
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:27,854
and the job opening up
at the Scripps Institute?

285
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,823
What about that? Huh?

286
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:35,029
Simple. Just give up your life
and follow me.

287
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:36,701
(She laughs)

288
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:43,114
- Oh, I'm happy for you. I am.
- I know you are.

289
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,659
What are we gonna do?

290
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,128
- Aha.
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:05,088
(Both chuckling)

292
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:16,845
- Ooh!
- (Laughs)

293
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,018
(Chuckles)

294
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:27,860
Come on.

295
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:32,068
- Oh, I don't go in the water.
- You don't swim?

296
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:34,524
Not even with friends?

297
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:39,151
Oh, uh, I swim.
I just, uh, I... I...

298
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:43,828
(Sighs) It's something that happened
when I was a kid.

299
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:46,791
I don't go in the water.
(Laughs awkwardly)

300
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:48,625
Hmm.

301
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:51,870
I bet I can overcome
your childhood fears.

302
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:01,213
I bet you can.

303
00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:05,461
Come on.

304
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,595
My boots!

305
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,344
Kick 'em off, cowboy.

306
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:24,223
- Kelly!
- Come on in, Sean. It's fun.

307
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:28,066
Come on.

308
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:31,862
- Here?
- Yeah, OK.

309
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:34,822
Somewhere down there
is the best coral.

310
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:39,029
A guy in Miami will give us
$200 for the good stuff.

311
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:41,827
Put it in the basket.
I'll pull it up.

312
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:57,712
(Kelly laughing in distance)

313
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,717
Come on, hurry, Randy.

314
00:24:21,023 --> 00:24:22,930
I love this park at night.
It's so deserted.

315
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:24,439
Yeah. So quiet.

316
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:27,103
Wait a second.
Isn't that Kelly's car?

317
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:29,024
Stop, stop, stop. Shh! Wait a second.

318
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,523
Stop.

319
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:38,399
Shh.

320
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,990
(Giggling)

321
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:07,215
I don't believe it.

322
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:09,633
She got him in the water.

323
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,383
Never underestimate the power, huh?

324
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:32,190
Attention. You, in the water. You are
trespassing on Sea World property.

325
00:25:32,237 --> 00:25:36,480
Come out of the water with your hands
raised high above your head.

326
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,569
I'm OK. My brother works here.

327
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:43,191
Uh, I'm Kelly Ann Bukowski,
from the ski team.

328
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:45,485
You turkeys have any ID?

329
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:48,288
Wait a minute.

330
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:50,573
- Mike? Kay?
- Brother?

331
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:53,374
Mr Bullhorn sees all, knows all!

332
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,208
Dead is what you are!

333
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:58,251
You keep your hands
to yourself, young m...

334
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,916
- (Kelly screeches)
- Here, take this.

335
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:03,039
(Mike) Yell for mother!

336
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:07,547
(Mike, Sean shouting, indistinct)

337
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:10,047
Finish up down there, damn it!

338
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,798
Come on, Randy.
We gotta get outta here!

339
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:15,218
- (Muffled thud)
- Now what?

340
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,633
Ow!

341
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:31,731
(Shouts)

342
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:34,816
(Kelly) Mike!

343
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:38,276
(Girls screeching)

344
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:40,279
(Kelly yelling, indistinct)

345
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:43,193
(Yelling, screaming)

346
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:47,442
- (Kay) You cheater!
- (Screams)

347
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,113
(Sean) That's what you are! Dead!

348
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:01,829
Some guys can sleep in
in the morning.

349
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,129
Some of us have to
be at work early. Good morning.

350
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:09,668
Some of us don't have to baby-sit a
park full of slugs and fishes either.

351
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,421
Yes, we just live
like slugs and fishes.

352
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:15,754
The dog does not
eat on the counter.

353
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:20,097
(Groans) I put your wet clothes
in the dryer, sweetie.

354
00:27:20,144 --> 00:27:23,143
- Thanks.
- Mmm. What are we eating?

355
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:25,261
Mmm. Thank you.

356
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,640
Hey, is this my beeper
or your beeper?

357
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,141
- I dunno. I'll use this beeper.
- Use that beeper.

358
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,602
Talk to you later.

359
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,975
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper.

360
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:39,863
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper back.

361
00:27:39,906 --> 00:27:42,313
- Bye.
- See you later.

362
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,734
Aye.

363
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:46,862
Coffee?

364
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,994
Just throw it in my eyes,
it'll work faster.

365
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,789
That's what happens
when you stay up all night

366
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:54,824
workin' out childhood phobias.

367
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,543
That's right.
Make fun of your baby brother.

368
00:27:57,585 --> 00:28:00,999
I was this close to doing it
in the water last night,

369
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,372
and that's a first.

370
00:28:02,421 --> 00:28:05,420
- This close, huh?
- Shut up!

371
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:07,420
(Laughs)

372
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:10,251
Sorry. I didn't know it was therapy.

373
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:12,339
Just admit it. You messed me up.

374
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:15,753
I admit it. I messed you up.

375
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:18,758
Is everything all right
with you and Kathryn?

376
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,465
(Phone)

377
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:22,839
Hello? Yes, sir.

378
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:30,021
Calvin, I had my crew
on that yesterday.

379
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:33,146
Well, I know.
I don't want that to happen either.

380
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:35,017
(Sighs) Tomorrow.

381
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,776
OK, OK. Calvin, I'll be right there.

382
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:43,484
- The boss, right?
- I gotta go to work.

383
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:49,524
- Yeah, can't do better than that!
- Really.

384
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:52,281
(Squeaking)

385
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,949
Yeah. Yeah!

386
00:28:54,998 --> 00:28:57,700
Who's a good girl? That's my baby.

387
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,706
(Dan) Kay?

388
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:02,323
(Kay) How are Cindy and Sandy?

389
00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:05,660
Well, Cindy's OK,
but Sandy's still nervous.

390
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:11,704
(Kay) Don't quit, Danny.
He can go higher.

391
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:16,592
(Kay) That's it!

392
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:21,762
OK, girls. There are my girls.

393
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:25,507
Thank you. Come on. Ready... and go!

394
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,432
That's it.

395
00:29:28,812 --> 00:29:32,428
What is this?
You ready? I said go!

396
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:37,520
If those are the best behaviours,
I'd hate to see the worst.

397
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,768
May I help you?

398
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,859
Are you looking for somebody?

399
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:47,067
No, I don't think you can.
I'm looking for someone in authority.

400
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:50,319
Well, I'm Dr Morgan,
the senior biologist.

401
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,608
Oh.

402
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,988
Really?

403
00:29:57,873 --> 00:29:59,828
Charming. Philip FitzRoyce.

404
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,747
I know you. I know your work.

405
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:05,491
We were at that Law of the Sea
Conference together last summer.

406
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:07,750
Right. Helsinki. Save the Whales.

407
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:09,752
They made a hero out of me.

408
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:14,539
You know what I never understood?
Why did you ram that Japanese whaler?

409
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:18,883
(Chuckles) Because he got in my way,
ruined my best shot.

410
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:21,928
Yeah. I was impressed.

411
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:29,055
Good. Then perhaps we can have
a drink and some dinner tonight?

412
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:35,096
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr FitzRoyce, but...
that's a behaviour I just don't do.

413
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:41,432
Nice spins, Danny.
I'll meet you at the holding tank.

414
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,937
Hey, aqua girl!

415
00:30:44,988 --> 00:30:48,402
- Hi, Mike!
- Five.

416
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,111
(Grunts)

417
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:04,036
He don't sleep in, he don't live in.

418
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,788
Tell Shelby Overman
he can take a flyin' leap

419
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:10,167
at a rollin' doughnut on a gravel
driveway, you hear?

420
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:12,786
Hold it.
Didn't he come home last night?

421
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,294
- No.
- He didn't show up here either.

422
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:19,255
- I figure he's home hung over.
- I don't want him around my place!

423
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:21,129
He's gone. You take his stuff.

424
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,133
Charlene, what's goin' on, huh?

425
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,258
- Shelby Overman's AWOL again.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

426
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,474
- What, is this all his stuff?
- Yeah. Doesn't figure.

427
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:34,183
He left his passport and his...
and his credit cards.

428
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:37,265
Driver's licence, pawn tickets.

429
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:40,763
I don't think he could have been
planning to go too far.

430
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,769
You don't think
something happened to him?

431
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,316
No. No, look.
He is curled up, drunk someplace.

432
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:49,651
When I find him,
he's in deep trouble.

433
00:31:49,697 --> 00:31:52,483
We'll let you know
as soon as we hear anything.

434
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:55,618
- Wanna help me out?
- Yeah. Take care, Charlene.

435
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:58,115
- Help me look in the lagoon?
- You bet.

436
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:01,659
Hey, I'm mad at that old boy,
but I don't mean him any harm.

437
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:04,113
You hear me?
I don't mean him any harm!

438
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:13,661
Down a little more.

439
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:15,671
Turn it.

440
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:21,339
Batteries are fully charged, Mike.

441
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:23,875
- Thank you, Danny.
- Thanks, Danny.

442
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:29,136
Control room, submersible
is now entering the lagoon.

443
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:32,551
- Roger.
- I can monitor it from here.

444
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:36,728
(Technician) 'Testing, one,
two, three. Can you read me, Kay? '

445
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:39,343
(Kay) 'I read you.
Communication's fine.

446
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:42,565
'For Charlene's sake,
I sure hope he's all right.'

447
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:55,281
(Mike) 'There's Cindy... or Sandy?
I don't know how to tell them apart.'

448
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:58,241
(Kay) 'Cindy's a lot larger.'

449
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:08,029
(Mike) 'Control, this is Venture One.

450
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:11,497
'We're at 25 feet,
headed for the Spanish Galleon.'

451
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:16,786
I can see you now. Hi, Mike.

452
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:41,639
'Overman broke divers' rules
last night, out there.

453
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,559
'Went down to shackle
the sea gate alone.

454
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:48,439
'Lf anything happened, the current
would have washed him up here,

455
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,976
'toward the centre of the lagoon.'

456
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,394
(Kay) 'What about
the filtration pipes? '

457
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:57,903
'It's too strong a current
the other way.

458
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:59,943
'The flow's all into the lagoon.

459
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:03,860
'There's a million gallons
of fresh salt water every hour.'

460
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,826
(Kay) 'Could he be trapped
in the Spanish Galleon? '

461
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:16,039
(Mike) 'The superstructure could have
kept him from floating.'

462
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,585
(Kay) 'Mike! Oh, God.
For a second I thought... '

463
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:24,173
(Mike) 'Yeah, yeah. I know it.
We call him Oscar.

464
00:34:36,268 --> 00:34:40,051
'You stay here, Kay. I'll go into
the galleon for a closer look.'

465
00:34:40,104 --> 00:34:42,475
'Uh-uh, I'm goin' with you.'

466
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:49,147
(Mike) 'Goddamn dolphins!
What the hell are they doing? '

467
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:54,184
'I don't know. They've been acting
strange for days. Look at 'em.'

468
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,824
(Kay) 'Control,
we're leaving the sub.

469
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,954
- 'We'll be out of radio contact.'
- OK, Dr Morgan.

470
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:12,452
'Grab your ABS bottles, Kay.
Let's go.'

471
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:14,207
'OK, sweetie.'

472
00:36:05,994 --> 00:36:07,950
(Squeaks excitedly)

473
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:14,783
(Squeaks)

474
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:25,131
(Muffled scream)

475
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:37,468
(Muffled exchange)

476
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:51,647
(Mike, Kay, muffled) 'Go! Go! '

477
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,915
(Kay) Mike! Quick! Mike!

478
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:35,461
- The gate! Get the gate!
- Shark!

479
00:37:35,513 --> 00:37:37,302
- God!
- What's happening?

480
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,840
(Dan) Close, damn it! Close!

481
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,179
Shit!

482
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,933
- Oh, God! Are you OK?
- What the hell was that?

483
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:53,306
- Yeah! What is that?
- You OK?

484
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,227
My guv'nor's
the 16th Earl of Haddenfield.

485
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:59,727
Shake hands with the first Calvin
of Sea World.

486
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:02,352
- Enchanté.
- He know French too, huh?

487
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:04,147
Excuse me, Mr Bouchard...

488
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,901
Wait a minute.
We're havin' dinner here.

489
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,950
- This better be important.
- It is, sir.

490
00:38:09,993 --> 00:38:13,493
(Whispers) Mike and Dr Morgan
were pursued by a shark.

491
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:15,577
It is important. Come with me.

492
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:24,081
(Kay) Calvin, it was a great white.

493
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:27,128
Ten feet long, exhibiting
a typical feeding pattern.

494
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:30,125
On us, Calvin!
The damn thing tried to feed on us.

495
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,630
- Where is it?
- Right here.

496
00:38:36,678 --> 00:38:38,303
- Huh?
- (Whistles)

497
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:42,178
You know, Cal, this
could be a stroke of luck.

498
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:44,797
If we kill this beastie on camera...

499
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:49,351
I can guarantee you media coverage.

500
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:53,599
Lure him into a staging area,

501
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:57,265
and at the precise moment,
slit his belly wide open.

502
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:01,570
- Can you do that?
- You try and stop 'im, mate.

503
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:04,316
(Chuckles)
That's how we earn our bread.

504
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:09,947
Well, Jack is oversimplifying
matters, as is usual.

505
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:13,490
But... yeah, I can do that.

506
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,612
(Kay) No!
(Mike) No?

507
00:39:15,664 --> 00:39:17,950
What do you mean, no?

508
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:20,950
I don't know
if it's occurred to any of you-all,

509
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,782
but there isn't a great white alive
in captivity anywhere.

510
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:27,752
Now, we're unique here, Calvin,
you know that.

511
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:30,547
If any facility can
maintain a white, it's us.

512
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:35,296
If we could dart him, w-we could get
him in a holding tank...

513
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:38,877
Hold it! This is crazy, this is nuts.

514
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:41,633
White sharks are killers.
I know 'em.

515
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,466
My father, my brother, myself.

516
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:46,803
They're murderers. No, Kay.

517
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,475
Calvin, they die magnificently.

518
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:54,562
(Laughs)

519
00:39:54,606 --> 00:39:58,732
That would really be a spectacular
event. No doubt about that, huh?

520
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:05,652
What are we doing, Calvin,
planning a network special?

521
00:40:05,698 --> 00:40:11,567
We could be the first people on the
planet to have a great white alive.

522
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,199
Not if my guv'nor
gets it first, miss.

523
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:19,075
OK. Say he kills it.
Well, that's it.

524
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:21,612
It's one shot, over, gone.

525
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:26,325
But a live great white...
You think about that, Calvin!

526
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:30,540
Nightly bulletins on the progress
of the killer shark.

527
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:33,374
Pictures of us nursing it
back to health

528
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:35,961
and lowering it into a holding tank.

529
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:37,632
Now, that's world news!

530
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:39,964
Think of the lines at the gate.

531
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:42,797
Then you miss the sport of the kill.

532
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:45,965
Now, wait up, Jack. Wait up.

533
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:48,766
(Philip) Killing is guaranteed press.

534
00:40:48,808 --> 00:40:52,757
But this other is much,
much more interesting.

535
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:06,017
OK, this is MS-2-22.

536
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:10,398
This is quinaldine, but I had to
guesstimate the dosage.

537
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:14,029
- Kathy?
- Right. Thanks, Danny.

538
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:18,445
All right, we're ready in Control.
You all set?

539
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:20,237
'We're ready down here.'

540
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:22,695
(Kay clears throat)

541
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:24,904
With those TV monitors rolling,

542
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,326
you're gonna have more coverage
than a space launch.

543
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,168
Good. Just the way I like it.

544
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:33,127
The colour of your wet suit's
one hell of a choice.

545
00:41:33,172 --> 00:41:35,661
- The shark's gonna love you.
- Exactly.

546
00:41:35,715 --> 00:41:38,966
- It helps me get the close-ups.
- You're the showman.

547
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,498
Honey, is this suit
gonna protect you?

548
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:42,714
Have you felt?

549
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:46,343
It won't bite through,
but it will yield to pressure.

550
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,259
So she might just get
a little... squeeze.

551
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:53,968
Oh, that's great news.
Look, why do you have to do this?

552
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:57,885
Why don't you let Her Majesty's
number one son take care of it?

553
00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:00,014
Because it's my job, remember?

554
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:03,147
Yeah, but I just don't
want it to be you.

555
00:42:03,192 --> 00:42:07,733
You build the stuff, I swim around
in it. That was the deal. Right?

556
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:09,152
Hmm?

557
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:12,147
I love you, too.

558
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,948
If we get into any trouble,
all we have to do is pull the pin.

559
00:42:22,997 --> 00:42:25,748
- What are those?
- (Jack) Mills bombs.

560
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,865
- What?
- Mills bombs, sonny.

561
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:32,244
Grenades. A chap in Her Majesty's
ordinance makes them up for me.

562
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:35,294
(Philip) 'Baby claymores.
Good dispersion.

563
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:38,042
'Some concussion
but they do the trick.'

564
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,758
Well, not in my water. Take 'em off.

565
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:44,087
You tend to your knitting,
my dear, and I tend to mine.

566
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:46,009
(Mike) Hold on a second there.

567
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:48,129
There's no explosives underwater.

568
00:42:48,181 --> 00:42:52,129
There's acrylic down there,
a very fragile environment. No bombs.

569
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:54,305
(Philip) 'Brody, this is insur... '

570
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:57,055
(Mike) 'No, I don't think
you understood me!

571
00:42:57,103 --> 00:43:02,059
'I built this park, and I'm not gonna
see some visiting fireman blow it up

572
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:04,310
'because he wants to kill a fish! '

573
00:43:04,357 --> 00:43:08,519
Calvin, are you listening
to all this?

574
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:11,438
No grenades.

575
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,196
For Christ's sake, guv'nor.
Remember Australia?

576
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:22,196
Oh, don't worry, Jack.
After all, it's only a little fish.

577
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:24,118
Son of a...

578
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:26,402
The pin has to be pulled.

579
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:31,745
Right. Get rid of this stuff.
Everybody aboard here? Let's go.

580
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:35,996
Shove off.

581
00:43:51,808 --> 00:43:54,761
(Kay) 'I need one clean belly shot.

582
00:43:54,809 --> 00:44:00,014
'Lf I miss, I'm gonna have to reload
and hope I get him with the second.'

583
00:44:00,063 --> 00:44:02,731
(Philip)
This is a good place to start.

584
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:06,893
(Engines stop)

585
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,312
(Mike) Hit the lights.

586
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:13,903
Shall we dance?

587
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:18,486
Why not? I'm beginning to feel like
King Richard going to the Crusades.

588
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,865
(Philip) Ready, Jack? Get the gear.

589
00:44:29,332 --> 00:44:31,574
(Jack) Brown bread, guv'nor.

590
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:36,410
You all right?

591
00:44:36,462 --> 00:44:38,453
Good luck.

592
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:31,830
You only get one shot.

593
00:45:31,873 --> 00:45:33,949
(Mike) Yeah, I know. I know.

594
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:36,749
(Mike exhales)

595
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:39,578
What about Kathryn?

596
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:43,920
It'll stick in the shark.
Hit her, and it'll go right through.

597
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:47,000
Just buoy him up,
slow him down, right?

598
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:50,550
Dorsal fin, middle of the back.

599
00:45:56,266 --> 00:45:58,339
Seen anything yet?

600
00:45:58,391 --> 00:46:01,176
We'll get him on the monitors.

601
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:23,271
(Kay grunting)

602
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:26,324
(Kay screams)

603
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:51,374
Quick! Mike, He's making a run!

604
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:55,627
Quick, shoot him!

605
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,587
(Philip) He's getting away!

606
00:46:57,638 --> 00:46:59,429
Damn it!

607
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:04,926
(Mike) Get outta the way, Kay!

608
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:06,554
(Kay) Now!

609
00:47:30,493 --> 00:47:32,486
Come on.

610
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:34,744
Right. There you go.

611
00:47:34,788 --> 00:47:36,864
You did it, baby.

612
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,121
Here's the ladder. Hold on.

613
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:41,040
Come on. Give me your fins.

614
00:47:41,085 --> 00:47:44,417
- Give me your fins.
- Let's go!

615
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:46,122
(Dan) Up you go.

616
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:49,919
You all right?

617
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:52,841
(Gasps)

618
00:47:52,884 --> 00:47:55,589
- Close one.
- (Mike) Get this stuff off her.

619
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:59,169
- (Liz) That was great!
- What am I, a bloody porter?

620
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:02,387
- How about a hand with this?
- First things first.

621
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:05,682
- Mustn't ignore the ladies.
- Don't ignore the help.

622
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:09,723
(Mike) Looked hairy down there.
(Liz) You OK? I was worried.

623
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:12,640
You sure know how
to scare the hell outta me.

624
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:17,348
Be sure he's wrapped, OK? Keep him
wet. Let's get him in a tank.

625
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:22,689
(Calvin) 'Film all right?
TV picture looked cloudy.'

626
00:48:22,738 --> 00:48:27,148
Calvin. Kathryn's fine,
Philip is fine, Jack is fine.

627
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:29,439
'Dan and Liz are fine.
I am OK too.'

628
00:48:29,492 --> 00:48:31,567
But... is the film OK?

629
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,073
It's absolutely first-rate, Cal.

630
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,445
You'll be very happy.

631
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,288
Is everyone OK? It did look
pretty dangerous down there.

632
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:46,033
It looked pretty dangerous
from down here too, Calvin.

633
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:50,620
(Kay) We may have to work him
all night, keep him moving.

634
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:54,883
Down, Danny. Down, down. That's it.

635
00:48:54,926 --> 00:48:58,293
Be sure the oxygen keeps
running through his gills.

636
00:48:58,345 --> 00:49:00,253
We don't wanna lose him.

637
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,261
(Door opens)

638
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:07,298
Close the door!
Whoever you are, this is off limits.

639
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:13,474
Liz, uh, get the hose running.
I wanna try aerating him, OK?

640
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:15,264
(Door closes)

641
00:49:15,314 --> 00:49:18,313
Even to me, the fearless harpoonist?

642
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:21,274
Nah, you're OK.

643
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:24,273
Come on in, sailor.
Are you new in town?

644
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:28,730
Yeah. Came by to get me
a woman and a tattoo.

645
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:31,403
- Wanna see the tattoo?
- (Chuckles)

646
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:35,494
Well, I'd rather see the woman,
get a look at the competition.

647
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:39,367
There isn't any other woman,
there isn't any tattoo either.

648
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:42,117
I'm lonely.

649
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:46,743
- I'm sorry, darlin'.
- Damn mammal.

650
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:50,249
This one's a fish.

651
00:49:50,297 --> 00:49:54,755
A simple, beautiful fish.

652
00:49:58,177 --> 00:49:59,421
OK.

653
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,176
Mike! Mike! What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

654
00:50:04,222 --> 00:50:06,179
- Liz, take a hike.
- OK.

655
00:50:06,224 --> 00:50:09,010
If this is the only way
we can be together,

656
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:11,727
this is the only way
we can... be together.

657
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:15,849
Welcome aboard, sailor.
Get that hose and hold onto it.

658
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:17,888
- Yeah. OK.
- Open the mouth.

659
00:50:17,939 --> 00:50:20,015
Say "hi" to your new friend.

660
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:23,732
This is the first time
you've ever done my work with me.

661
00:50:23,778 --> 00:50:26,482
Yeah, well, it's a real thrill.

662
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:30,693
Maybe tomorrow you can work with me
and help me pour foundations.

663
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,150
(Laughs, screams)

664
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,983
Get away! Get clear! Get clear!

665
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:42,870
Didn't he give you any signs?

666
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:47,456
No! One minute he was dead out,
the next he was wide awake!

667
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:50,169
(Kay) No food. No medication.

668
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:54,705
It's the only live one in captivity,
guys. Let's keep him that way.

669
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:58,374
Huh? Don't do anything
that's gonna traumatise him.

670
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:14,174
(Applause)

671
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:21,553
(Woman on PA) 'Welcome to the opening
of the Undersea Kingdom.

672
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:25,686
'The magical mysteries of Jonah
and the Whale, the Coral Forest

00:51:38,244 --> 00:51:39,951
Gotcha, guv'nor.

675
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:49,784
(Calvin) It's a whale with a brain
larger than most folks,

676
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:51,707
able to earn beaucoup bucks.

677
00:51:51,753 --> 00:51:55,797
Kay and I went down in the sub,

678
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,830

679

What if Overman went down
on the other side?

680
00:52:01,008 --> 00:52:05,336

but his body should have shown up.

the filtration pipe?

No, the current's
too strong goin' the other way.

flowing into the lagoon every hour.

684

The man's irresponsible.
When he turns up, fire him.

685
00:52:19,355 --> 00:52:23,516
Hold it, Calvin. He's a good man.
He just messes up once in awhile.

01:03:25,759 --> 01:03:30,335
No! Overman was killed
inside the park.

849
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:33,885
The baby was caught
inside the park.

850
01:03:33,932 --> 01:03:37,549
Its mother is inside the park.

851
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:54,193
(Echoing) She's right there!

852
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:56,109
(Screaming)

853
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:04,939
(Woman) How did that thing
get in there?

854
01:04:04,993 --> 01:04:08,693
- The animals are in the lagoon!
- Ski show!

855
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:11,663
Control, this is Bouchard.
Listen carefully!

856
01:04:11,707 --> 01:04:15,998
Clear the tunnel, let the people out,
close the gate and seal the park!

857
01:04:16,043 --> 01:04:18,450
Seal the park!
I'll be down in a minute.

858
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:23,663
(Man) Hey! Hey! Watch it!

859
01:04:23,715 --> 01:04:26,798
(Woman) Who is that guy?
(Man) Watch out!

860
01:04:38,057 --> 01:04:41,472
Hey, bring it over here! Hey!

861
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:51,480
All right. I've had enough fun.
Let's go in now.

862
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:53,563
Come on. You're enjoying this.

863
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:57,025
No. Look, don't you
have to be at work or something?

864
01:04:57,071 --> 01:04:59,986
I don't have to be back
till the second half.

865
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:02,070
- Oh.
- Come on.

866
01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:05,356
Gotcha, lovers.

867
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,653
- Shit!
- God.

868
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:11,069
- Get out! Get out!
- Hey, what the?!

869
01:05:11,121 --> 01:05:13,326
Hey, what are ya doin'?!

870
01:05:14,584 --> 01:05:15,911
Brody!

871
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:18,079
Get out of the water. Get out!

872
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:21,791
Get out of the water, please.
Please, come in from the water.

873
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,621
Out of the water! Come on!
Get out of the water!

874
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:28,415
Out of the water!

875
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,875
Get out!

876
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:38,088
Get outta the way!

877
01:05:41,226 --> 01:05:42,883
Shit!

878
01:05:49,606 --> 01:05:51,893
(Man) This is Sea World Control.

879
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:55,188
Uh-huh.

880
01:05:55,234 --> 01:05:57,559
Yes. I got him right here.

881
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,818
(PA) 'All right, boys.
Come take a bow.

882
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:09,359
'I apologise to have you...
No! Get up here! '

883
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,160
Get outta the water!
Get outta the water!

884
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:14,202
(Announcer) Boys. Boys!

885
01:06:14,248 --> 01:06:17,081
Bring the boat in!
Get outta the water!

886
01:06:17,582 --> 01:06:20,499
You're gonna get both of us
fired out here!

887
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,333
Get out! Everybody out!

888
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:24,333
Gimme the mike!

889
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:26,454
Hey, Brody! Come back here!

890
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:28,413
Get outta the water!

891
01:06:28,465 --> 01:06:31,002
Bring it in.

892
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,670
Bring the boat in!
Get outta the water now!

893
01:06:33,718 --> 01:06:36,671
Ready, up! One. Two.

894
01:06:38,014 --> 01:06:41,512
Bring that boat in!
Get outta the water right now!

895
01:06:41,557 --> 01:06:44,473
Hey, get me down! Just get me down!

896
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:46,889
- Get me down!
- What are you saying?

897
01:06:46,977 --> 01:06:49,597
There's something back there!
A shark!

898
01:06:49,647 --> 01:06:51,886
Bring your boat in!

899
01:06:58,278 --> 01:06:59,900
There's a shark!

900
01:06:59,944 --> 01:07:01,936
(Audience screaming)

901
01:07:07,784 --> 01:07:09,608
(Screaming continues)

902
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:11,698
(Brody on PA) Get outta the water!

903
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:15,277
(Girls) One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

904
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,994
- Get out!
- Up. Turn.

905
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:24,243
Oh, my God! Shark!

906
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:33,290
(Brody) Get outta the water!

907
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:37,290
(Man in boat)
We're coming! We're coming!

908
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,336
It's gonna eat us!

909
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,881
They'll die!

910
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:46,551
- Gimme your hand. Come on!
- Pull me out!

911
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:52,228
Hang on!

912
01:07:58,483 --> 01:08:01,400
(Sean) Needs a choke or something.
Pull it.

913
01:08:02,987 --> 01:08:04,693
(Both gasp)

914
01:08:15,078 --> 01:08:16,738
(Sean) Hold my hand.

915
01:08:18,414 --> 01:08:20,322
(Sean) Kelly!

916
01:08:20,373 --> 01:08:22,282
Shark!

917
01:08:22,334 --> 01:08:23,992
Kelly!

918
01:08:29,379 --> 01:08:30,956
Kelly!

919
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,291
- What the hell is that?
- Shit! Hang on!

920
01:08:57,899 --> 01:08:59,522
(Girl) What happened?

921
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:02,270
(Girl) She's drowning!
She's drowning!

922
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,768
Swim! Swim, kid, swim!

923
01:09:08,572 --> 01:09:10,898
(People gasping)

924
01:09:17,328 --> 01:09:19,319
(Philip) Call an ambulance.

925
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:21,908
Quickly. Come on.
Get out of the way!

926
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:23,699
Get a paramedic!

927
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,159
Look out, Mommy!

928
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:37,503
- Did you call an ambulance?
- Yeah, the paramedics.

929
01:09:37,551 --> 01:09:41,925
(Mike) Twist that tourniquet tight
and hold it there.

930
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,878
(Sean) I'm here. You're OK.

931
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:48,056
(Man) They're bringin' in the
wounded. The ambulance is on the way.

932
01:09:48,099 --> 01:09:51,714
Shall I leave the gate open?
Cindy and Sandy are out there.

933
01:09:51,768 --> 01:09:53,345
Shit.

934
01:09:54,854 --> 01:09:57,521
No. They'll have to
take care of themselves.

935
01:09:57,565 --> 01:10:00,480
We can't take our chance
on that big bitch gettin' in.

936
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:05,688
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Fine.

937
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:08,486
Uh, I'm gonna go with Kelly.

938
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:10,935
I think you should.

939
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:14,571
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

940
01:10:18,994 --> 01:10:22,777
Hello out there.
This is Calvin Bouchard.

941
01:10:22,831 --> 01:10:25,830
May I please
have your kind attention.

942
01:10:25,874 --> 01:10:27,996
Due to technical difficulties,

943
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:31,409
it has become necessary for us
to temporarily close

944
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,033
the Undersea Kingdom now.

945
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:37,954
For those of you all still in
the underwater portion of this park,

946
01:10:38,007 --> 01:10:42,713
please follow your guides,
and they will point out

947
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,630
the most convenient
and accessible exits.

948
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,923
Where the hell is the nearest
accessible exit? We're underwater!

949
01:10:49,974 --> 01:10:51,846
- Is this off?
- Uh-huh.

950
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:54,596
- Gimme some lights down there!
- OK.

951
01:10:54,643 --> 01:10:58,508
Can't see shit down there!
Get me some medical attention, quick!

952
01:10:58,562 --> 01:11:01,728
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
please follow me

953
01:11:01,772 --> 01:11:05,982
in an orderly fashion, and remember -
walk, do not run.

954
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:14,354
Daddy, Daddy! Look at the fish!

955
01:11:14,406 --> 01:11:16,730
- Look!
- Holy shit!

956
01:11:16,783 --> 01:11:18,823
(Panicked screams)

957
01:11:21,537 --> 01:11:24,453
(Screaming)

958
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,913
(Technician) Tunnel six failure.

959
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:42,333
It's Jonah and the Whale.

960
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:47,208
Tube integrity has been compromised.
We've got leakage and pressure loss.

961
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,722
We have to seal the section
or we'll lose the whole complex.

962
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,766
- Watertight doors. Hit it.
- On automatic.

963
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:01,854
They're all on go status.
Activated. Now!

964
01:12:01,897 --> 01:12:03,520
(People screaming)

965
01:12:08,818 --> 01:12:10,726
I need my wallet!

966
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:13,651
(Screaming continues)

967
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:41,714
Quiet! Quiet! Please!

968
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:45,414
I need your attention, please. Quiet!

969
01:12:45,468 --> 01:12:49,299
Now the water is not going
any higher, so calm down, OK?

970
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:52,015
It's stopped.
It's stopped, so calm down.

971
01:12:54,766 --> 01:12:58,013
(Guide) 'The oxygen that we have
in here is all we have,

972
01:12:58,059 --> 01:13:02,138
'so let's not panic, but let's try
to take shallow breaths, OK? '

973
01:13:17,573 --> 01:13:19,364
- Hey, Mike.
- Yeah!

974
01:13:19,407 --> 01:13:23,023
This is our last cut. I think
our tunnel patch is ready to go.

975
01:13:23,077 --> 01:13:25,993
Good. Rig the winch
on that work boat up there.

976
01:13:26,036 --> 01:13:27,743
You got it.

977
01:13:29,456 --> 01:13:32,160
- How much longer, sweetie?
- I don't know.

978
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:33,367
No?

979
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:36,916
We're gonna have to nudge these
tunnel sections together.

980
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:39,711
Then we'll patch it
and weld the whole thing.

981
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:40,952
Then we evacuate?

982
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:43,957
No, then we put pressure back
into the tunnels,

983
01:13:44,008 --> 01:13:47,874
then the watertight doors
will open up, then people go home.

984
01:13:47,926 --> 01:13:51,294
Hey, watch how you're
cuttin' that. It's critical!

985
01:13:51,346 --> 01:13:54,179
Relax.
You're doin' everything you can.

986
01:13:54,223 --> 01:13:56,262
Come on. Come over here.

987
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,842
Listen.

988
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,968
I've been thinking.

989
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:07,513
Maybe Venezuela
can use some trained whales.

990
01:14:07,565 --> 01:14:09,851
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

991
01:14:09,898 --> 01:14:11,606
I think this one's on me.

992
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:14,355
- But next year...
- I'll follow you anywhere.

993
01:14:14,402 --> 01:14:15,944
- Yeah!
- I love you!

994
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:18,061
(Chattering)

995
01:14:22,741 --> 01:14:24,400
Ah, Mr Glass.

996
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,739
Is Mr Bouchard going to be here?

997
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:29,784
Please, please.
I have a statement to make.

998
01:14:29,829 --> 01:14:33,078
- Was there an explosion?
- How many people are missing?

999
01:14:33,124 --> 01:14:35,743
Late today,
due to a minor disturbance,

1000
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:39,125
there was a pressure failure
in one of the tunnels -

1001
01:14:39,169 --> 01:14:41,207
a major attraction at the park.

1002
01:14:41,253 --> 01:14:44,205
We estimate that 30 to 40 people

1003
01:14:44,255 --> 01:14:47,040
were in the process
of being evacuated

1004
01:14:47,089 --> 01:14:51,631
when the watertight safety doors
temporarily delayed their exit.

1005
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:54,463
We're working right now
to release them

1006
01:14:54,513 --> 01:14:57,181
under the safest
possible circumstances.

1007
01:14:57,223 --> 01:15:00,471
Seven visitors were also injured
in our beach area.

1008
01:15:00,516 --> 01:15:03,932
- That's all. Give me a break.
- What about a shark?

1009
01:15:03,977 --> 01:15:07,759
- I'll let you know as I know more.
- A very large shark...

1010
01:15:07,814 --> 01:15:10,517
That's all. There is no more.

1011
01:15:10,565 --> 01:15:12,473
(Woman) When will this be fixed?

1012
01:15:12,525 --> 01:15:15,192
(Guide)
I'm sure they're working on it.

1013
01:15:15,236 --> 01:15:18,602
Stay together to keep warm.
I know you're cold.

1014
01:15:18,653 --> 01:15:23,894
Stay together, take shallow breaths
and concentrate on your breathing.

1015
01:15:41,128 --> 01:15:43,497
Well, any sign of mother?

1016
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,159
OK, then.

1017
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:49,913
Where did the animal
hide the first time?

1018
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:52,837
Uh...

1019
01:15:54,678 --> 01:15:56,883
filtration pipe.

1020
01:15:56,929 --> 01:15:58,920
Opposite side of the lagoon.

1021
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:03,631
Brody, is there an access hatch,
a backwash gate?

1022
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:09,723
Heavy grillwork. Keeps the pumps
clear when we back-flush that system.

1023
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:13,104
Why? What do you want to do?
Get that thing back in?

1024
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:15,104
He's a bright lad.

1025
01:16:15,149 --> 01:16:19,893
Yes. Jack and I are going to lure him
back into the pipe,

1026
01:16:19,944 --> 01:16:23,941
close the gates and then dispose
of him at our leisure.

1027
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:28,281
Meanwhile, you can weld your patch
and then evacuate the civilians.

1028
01:16:28,324 --> 01:16:31,609
What if she doesn't want
to go back in?

1029
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:35,953
I think we can pretty much
guarantee she'll want to go back in.

1030
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:38,153
- Right, Jack?
- Sure.

1031
01:16:38,206 --> 01:16:40,875
Just how are you
going to guarantee that?

1032
01:16:42,502 --> 01:16:44,493
Live bait.

1033
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:48,161
(Man) We're ready to move
out over the tunnel now.

1034
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:50,170
(Mike) Let's go.

1035
01:17:00,805 --> 01:17:02,926
L-I'll be in the Control Room.

1036
01:17:02,973 --> 01:17:05,380
I'll go with you.

1037
01:17:07,143 --> 01:17:09,514
(Man) Give me that.
I'll store it over here.

1038
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,019
(Man) No, I got it.

1039
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:14,808
(Technician)
Yeah, we're on top of it.

1040
01:17:14,855 --> 01:17:16,978
OK. Thanks.

1041
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:27,230
Now, where's that damn fish?

1042
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:31,947
There. I've got him.

1043
01:17:31,993 --> 01:17:34,529
(Technician)
Sorry, it's the dolphins.

1044
01:17:37,288 --> 01:17:39,993
Babies, stay out of it, please.

1045
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,992
...and I've rigged a lifeline.

1046
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:47,168
Just let the pumps push you out and
use the rope to pull yourself back.

1047
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:48,586
Right.

1048
01:17:49,964 --> 01:17:53,579
And why don't I do all the filming?

1049
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:57,545
I want both cameras.
We need the coverage. Come on, Jack!

1050
01:17:57,593 --> 01:17:59,549
This isn't a picnic.

1051
01:17:59,593 --> 01:18:03,591
This film is a bloody
retirement annuity.

1052
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:06,472
I'd feel better
if you did just the one thing.

1053
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:08,472
(Laughs) What's the matter?

1054
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,509
Getting cold feet?

1055
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:21,023
OK, Bob. Hold it about right there.

1056
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:24,685
- We're right over the tunnel.
- OK, we're all set.

1057
01:18:24,736 --> 01:18:27,227
(Mike)
'Tell FitzRoyce we're in position.'

1058
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,687
FitzRoyce, you can go now.

1059
01:18:54,923 --> 01:18:59,629
(Technician) They're testing
the lifeline to see if it's secure.

1060
01:19:19,357 --> 01:19:23,400
(Calvin) 'They're spreadin' some
chum. You know, fish oil and blood.

1061
01:19:23,443 --> 01:19:26,359
'Then Jack's gonna make
some metallic sounds

1062
01:19:26,403 --> 01:19:29,818
'to attract her right down
into that filtration pipe.'

1063
01:19:29,863 --> 01:19:31,690
Start the pumps.

1064
01:19:31,741 --> 01:19:33,861
You got it.

1065
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,782
(Metal clanging)

1066
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:01,375
(Clanging)

1067
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:06,798
(Technician) It's in!
(Calvin) He's got it!

1068
01:21:06,846 --> 01:21:08,920
All right. It's locked.

1069
01:21:10,972 --> 01:21:13,095
It's safe, Brody. Go for it.

1070
01:21:13,141 --> 01:21:15,050
OK, let's go.

1071
01:22:06,926 --> 01:22:08,337
(Muffled scream)

1072
01:22:42,618 --> 01:22:45,951
(Technician) 'This is Control.
Is that patch in place? '

1073
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:47,739
Easy.

1074
01:22:57,628 --> 01:23:00,332
Let me help you with that,
Dr Morgan.

1075
01:23:00,379 --> 01:23:02,286
Got it!

1076
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,712
Now weld the son-of-a-bitch...

1077
01:23:07,969 --> 01:23:10,505
(Calvin) Kathryn, what are you doin'?

1078
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:12,629
I'm going down there.

1079
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:16,805
You crazy?

1080
01:23:16,848 --> 01:23:19,420
He needs eyes
in the back of his head.

1081
01:23:24,437 --> 01:23:26,725
- Thanks, Fred.
- All right.

1082
01:23:26,772 --> 01:23:28,929
Watch the tanks.

1083
01:23:28,982 --> 01:23:30,607
OK.

1084
01:23:34,235 --> 01:23:36,523
- Here are your fins.
- Thanks.

1085
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,025
Be careful down there now.

1086
01:23:53,665 --> 01:23:55,870
(Hinges creaking)

1087
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:27,344
(Sighs) You all right?

1088
01:24:28,437 --> 01:24:30,346
Where's Mr FitzRoyce?

1089
01:24:30,397 --> 01:24:32,354
I have no idea.

1090
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:37,442
(Man) What's goin' on?

1091
01:24:40,113 --> 01:24:41,311
Guv'nor!

1092
01:24:41,573 --> 01:24:43,362
Guv'nor!

1093
01:24:43,615 --> 01:24:46,236
Guv'nor!

1094
01:24:46,326 --> 01:24:48,032
There's no other way out?

1095
01:24:48,077 --> 01:24:50,316
You don't understand. This is it!

1096
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:52,325
Have you looked?

1097
01:24:52,371 --> 01:24:55,157
He didn't come up.

1098
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:58,621
Guv'nor, you bloody bastard.
Answer me!

1099
01:25:05,005 --> 01:25:07,922
We'll suffocate the bitch.
Shut down the pumps.

1100
01:25:07,965 --> 01:25:09,245
Are you sure?

1101
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,464
- Why don't we blow it up?
- Listen, nephew.

1102
01:25:12,509 --> 01:25:16,588
A $2.5 million turbine's not going up
in smoke cos of a damn fish!

1103
01:25:16,637 --> 01:25:19,257
Now shut the pumps down!

1104
01:25:20,641 --> 01:25:22,928
(Mechanical whirring)

1105
01:25:22,975 --> 01:25:25,300
What's happened?

1106
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,841
(Man) They've shut the pumps off.

1107
01:25:27,896 --> 01:25:32,721
(Sighs) That's all she needs.
The gates can't hold much longer.

1108
01:25:34,815 --> 01:25:38,895
(Sobbing) Philip, pull the pin!
Pull the pin, Philip.

1109
01:26:05,044 --> 01:26:07,535
(Metallic clanking on monitor)

1110
01:26:13,842 --> 01:26:16,214
(Clanking)

1111
01:26:40,194 --> 01:26:42,350
(Clanking continues)

1112
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,289
(Woman) Look at that!

1113
01:27:10,256 --> 01:27:13,042
(Woman) Jesus!

1114
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,128
(Fred) Oh, my God!

1115
01:27:15,216 --> 01:27:17,540
We gotta warn 'em.
We gotta tell 'em!

1116
01:27:17,593 --> 01:27:20,462
Get 'em up! It's coming back.
Get 'em up quick!

1117
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:22,669
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Come on!

1118
01:27:22,722 --> 01:27:23,884
Get 'em up!

1119
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:40,014
- Come on, Mike.
- Get out of there!

1120
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:49,863
- Come on, Mike!
- (Calvin) 'Get 'em up! '

1121
01:28:18,718 --> 01:28:20,923
(Muffled) Come on!

1122
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:30,966
(Squeaking)

1123
01:28:36,271 --> 01:28:38,097
(Squeaking)

1124
01:29:31,892 --> 01:29:33,682
(Muffled) Pull the door!

1125
01:30:02,953 --> 01:30:05,741
How the hell did it get loose?

1126
01:30:10,209 --> 01:30:12,663
Open the hatch!

1127
01:30:16,672 --> 01:30:18,912
(Fred) Come on up, Mike. I gotcha.

1128
01:30:24,928 --> 01:30:27,297
Are you all right?

1129
01:30:27,345 --> 01:30:30,047
Do we have pressure
in those tunnels yet?

1130
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:33,182
- Affirmative.
- Then get those people out.

1131
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:38,767
Feel the air!
Can you feel the air?

1132
01:30:38,813 --> 01:30:41,765
The water's going down.
The water's going down!

1133
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:49,352
Try to be calm.
Don't rush to the door.

1134
01:31:00,409 --> 01:31:02,318
(Man) We're saved!

1135
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:04,490
(All talking and cheering)

1136
01:32:06,245 --> 01:32:08,699
(Muffled yelling, crunching)

1137
01:34:21,878 --> 01:34:23,785
Oh! We did it!

1138
01:34:23,838 --> 01:34:26,506
The others, Mike.
What about the others?

1139
01:34:26,547 --> 01:34:28,622
Calvin made it. Lisa.

1140
01:34:28,674 --> 01:34:32,209
Mike. Mike! The dolphins!

1141
01:34:33,344 --> 01:34:34,802
(Kay) Cindy!

1142
01:34:34,845 --> 01:34:37,251
(Mike) Cindy!
(Kay) Sandy!

1143
01:34:37,305 --> 01:34:40,838
- Come on! Cindy!
- Cindy!

1144
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:44,057
Oh, good girl. Sandy!

1145
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:45,380
(Squeaks)

1146
01:34:45,435 --> 01:34:50,391
Sandy, come on, baby.
Sandy, where are you?

1147
01:34:50,438 --> 01:34:52,346
(Mike) Sandy!

1148
01:34:53,607 --> 01:34:55,516
I hope she made it.

1149
01:34:57,527 --> 01:34:59,434
- Cindy, stay.
- Sandy.

1150
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:01,442
(Squeaks)

1151
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,401
Sandy!

1152
01:35:05,448 --> 01:35:07,689
All right!

1153
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,407
All right!
