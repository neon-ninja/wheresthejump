1
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,550
- Oh, my God! You hit her!
- Hell!

2
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,270
I don't know if she's conscious.

3
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,562
She's losing a lot of blood.
These cuts aren't from the fall.

4
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,023
Stay with you till the ambulance
gets here, all right?

5
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,896
Call 911.

6
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,694
Just try to stay awake.

7
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,748
- They're on their way.
- Who did this to you?

8
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,249
So, are you gonna tell them?

9
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,086
Kolobos.

10
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,543
What was that?

11
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,050
Is that your name?

12
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,726
What a shame.
She's a pretty girl.

13
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,774
It's a shame.
She's such a pretty girl.

14
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,614
Beauty's only skin deep.
She ought to be thankful to be alive.

15
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,654
She ought to be thankful just to be alive.

16
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,325
- Family notified?
- Any family notified?

17
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,413
No, she's only a Jane Doe.

18
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,955
Today is Jane's lucky day.
Jane's lucky day.

19
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,203
Your face!

20
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,581
Look at these lacerations.
They're clean, precise.

21
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,002
Clean, precise.

22
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,502
She mustn't have been
able to put up much of a fight!

23
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,472
Leave me room to work my magic.

24
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,057
Let's see what we can do
about making you pretty again.

25
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:14,680
- Making you pretty again.
- Kolobos. Today, you exist.

26
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,808
Today, you exist!

27
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,247
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hey, Doc.

28
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,712
Well, I see you're exposing our new guest
to more quality programming!

29
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,835
Ah, nothing but the best.

30
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,336
We'll be just a minute.

31
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,632
Hi.

32
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,885
I'm Dr. Waldman.
I'm an in-patient counselor.

33
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,895
Do you know where you are?

34
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,773
You were badly hurt, and the paramedics
brought you here to County General.

35
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,407
You were in surgery for quite some time,
but you're gonna be fine now.

36
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,330
This is Detective Byers
from the police department.

37
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,246
We were hoping that, given some time,
you'd be able to give us some information,

38
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,040
so we can help you.

39
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,418
Your name would be a good start.

40
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,927
You don't have to rush.

41
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,011
We can take it slowly.
Right, Detective Byers?

42
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,558
Fine.

43
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,358
Here's my card.

44
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,479
When you guys are ready
to pick up the pace, give me a call.

45
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,192
Charming, isn't he?

46
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,659
You get some rest now.
We'll talk again soon.

47
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,789
Shrinks and cops!
Honey, you got problems with a capital P!

48
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,042
Meanwhile, you could pass for first
runner-up in a King Tut lookalike contest.

49
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,668
What happened to you?

50
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,760
Ah! I know how it is.

51
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,633
Trouble's bad enough without having to
re-hash it for every ignoramus that walks by.

52
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,385
Gotta have your little escapes.
That's why I read these.

53
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,603
Trust me, nothing makes you feel better

54
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,269
than reading about some poor schmuck
who's worse off than you.

55
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,312
I'll show you. Listen.

56
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,983
Oh. "Single white female
seeking one good man.

57
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,733
"Must be financially stable, romantic,
secure and honest.

58
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,327
"Will only consider applicants interested
in long-term commitment." Yeah!

59
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,869
I see an empty mailbox in her future.
Oh. How about this one?

60
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,536
"Calling all ladies!

61
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,039
"Extremely handsome male, 49,
seeks woman with Mensa mind.

62
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,039
"I'm looking for a meaningful relationship.

63
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,259
"Please send photo with reply."
Yeah, great, buddy!

64
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,635
Ooh, now, <i>this</i> is interesting.
"Wanted, freeloaders...

65
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,428
"...Artist seeks five
progressive-minded individuals

66
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,268

00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,116
"I want you."

72
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,828
"The camera-shy need not apply!
Interested?"

73
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,822
Fuck, yeah! I'm interested!

74
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,076
Oh, shit! Can I say that on TV?

75
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,170
Hold up a minute, buddy.
I'm trying to do an interview here.

76
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,664
Anyway, dude, listen.
I would be great for your movie.

77
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,917
I'm not some kind of actress
or anything like that,

78
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,795
but I got that progressive-minded shit down!
Check it out.

79
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,890
Last month, we lose a butt-load of business
cos some guy croaks after eating here.

80
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,010
I don't know, contaminated pork
or something.

81
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,933
Anyway, I tell the manager
we should give away free stuff

82
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,306
to every 100th customer
who comes in here.

83
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,185
Two weeks later, this dump
is crawling with lard asses...

84
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,936
All right, already!

85
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,863
Stop the cameras a second.

86
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,280
Customer 79 over here just won himself

87
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,027
a free lemonade.

88
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,250
So, this house -
what exactly <i>is</i> the set-up?

89
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,243
Are there cameras everywhere?

90
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,791
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm totally comfortable with nudity.

91
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,885
It's just that in my transition
to serious film work,

92
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:19,098
I think it's important that directors
look beyond my physical attributes

93
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,091
and discover the real Erica.

94
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,265
That I am a woman of substance
and gravity.

95
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,729
I mean... you can see that,

96
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,192
can't you?

97
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,153
Office parties, oh, man!

98
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,774
You know, you gotta love 'em,
especially around Christmas.

99
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,653
It only takes one line
to get the secretary in the sack.

100
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,782
"Baby, I'm not Rudolph!

101
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,534
"And no, that's not my nose."

102
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,292
What a jerk!

103
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,514
Nice show.

104
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,431
I think that's my line. Enchanté.

105
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,435
Are you making a movie or something?

106
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,855
No, no, no. Just a little video
for a prospective employer.

107
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,899
Not that I won't be getting
glowing reviews from you guys.

108
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,772
Oh, I don't work here.

109
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,742
I'm paid entertainment, just like you.

110
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,907
Really? Let me guess.

111
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,405
Dancer?

112
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,498
Singer?

113
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,413
Female impersonator.

114
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,375
Nice to meet you.

115
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,927
It's not that I don't enjoy
the world of academia, I...

116
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,516
I just think there's only so much a person
can glean from organized education.

117
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,186
The real learning comes from
being out there, <i>doing</i> things,

118
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,772
you know, er... living your life!

119
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,607
The ironic part of this whole thing

120
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,981
is that I actually owe this realization
to one of my classes -

121
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,824
"a History of Western Cinema".

122
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,699
God! You know, it was such a revelation.

123
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,418
I mean, yes, I appreciate car chases
and explosions as much as the next guy...

124
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,751
But now I see what artists like you see.

125
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:20,511
The poetry and the beauty
of everyday existence.

126
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,301
Ah...

127
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,423
Jesus.

128
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,385
Uh!

129
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,305
That's what it's all about
when you get down to it -

130
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,276
man's struggle to overcome
whatever life throws his way,

131
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,067
whether that's battling
a six-foot alien

132
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,738
or, um...
his own personal demons.

133
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,740
Hi, I'm Kyra.

134
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,534
Kyra Mitchell.

135
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,124
Talk about yourself -
your hobbies, your interests.

136
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:55,246
Right, OK, um...
I enjoy reading and music.

137
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,838
I like music, too.

138
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:02,212
And I'm an artist, not a real one,
I just like to draw for myself.

139
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,051
Wait. I didn't mean to show that.

140
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,050
- Stop the camera, Dorothy.
- It's all right, Kyra.

141
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,099
No, they're gonna think I'm some kind
of a freak. Stop the camera.

142
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,018
- Kyra...
- I said shut it off.

143
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,238
Have you spoken with her?
Could she tell you what happened?

144
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,030
No, not yet. She's still non-responsive,
much to the chagrin of the police.

145
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,322
Ah, well...

146
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,492
There's a dangerous person out there.
You can understand their concern.

147
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,661
Well, there's a lot
of dangerous people out there,

148
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,753
but it's my opinion that none of them
have anything to do with her.

149
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,339
- I think she's a cutter.
- What? No.

150
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,427
Yes. I found several older nicks and scars
all over her body,

151
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,217
all apparently self-inflicted.

152
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,762
Hm. Not to mention this.

153
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,018
I think what we're dealing with is
a troubled young woman's plea for attention.

154
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,061
No, I disagree.

155
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,527
You didn't see the lacerations on her face
when she came in.

156
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,023
The kind of pain involved in that sort
of self-mutilation would be excruciating.

157
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,569
Some people get off on that.

158
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,445
Well, whether or not she enjoyed it,
the pain would still be there,

159
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,698
making it impossible to have made incisions
as flawless and deliberate as the ones I saw.

160
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,544
- Maybe she used drugs to numb the pain?
- No. We did a tox screen. She was clean.

161
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,127
That's the OR. I gotta run.

162
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,876
- Let me know if there's anything new.
- Of course.

163
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,924
You know what? There was something.

164
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,512
The other day I came into her room

165
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,508
and she was repeating a word
over and over in her sleep.

166
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,683
- Kolobos.
- Kolobos? What does it mean?

167
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,225
I have no idea.

168
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,358
Six years of med school, all I really needed
was a good dictionary. Who knew?

169
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,682
- Looks like your ride is late.
- Yeah. Maybe it's a sign.

170
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,396
Having second thoughts?

171
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,652
- It's OK if you're not ready.
- I am ready!

172
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:35,031
I'm... a little nervous, maybe,
but I'm gonna be OK.

173
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,080
- What have you done to your drawings?
- Nothing.

174
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,248
- Kyra!
- Look!

175
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,964
I know what you're going to say, Dorothy,
but no, I am not suppressing my id,

176
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:48,257
my inner child or whatever the Freudian
word of the day happens to be.

177
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,597
I just want to take my work
in a new direction, that's all.

178
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,966
That's all right,
if that's all there is to it.

179
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,648
What's up, coconut? You must be Kyra.
We're gonna be roomies!

180
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,074
A singing telegram!
Can you fucking believe it?

181
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,946
I'm half a stick of gum away
from giving this customer mouth-to-mouth,

182
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,415
when suddenly,
he jumps up and starts singing

183
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,752
that I'm gonna be swinging it up
in Mount Olympus. Ha!

184
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,463
That is so crazy.
I can't believe I'm doing this.

185
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,628
That's what I'm saying!

186
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,878
I don't have an artistic bone in my body.
And you?

187
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,549
I nearly shit a brick

188
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,641
when I rode up to your address
and it turned out to be the wacky shack!

189
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,596
Wow! Wacky shack?
I never heard that one before.

190
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,517
Hey, I wasn't trying
to diss you or nothing.

191
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,565
- I was just trying to...
- I know. It's OK. Forget it.

192
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,526
- OK.
- There's our exit.

Tom Galloway, gangster of love.

You, er, having a little trouble
with your sack, Tom?

Nothing a good yank or two won't cure,

Dude, does that crap ever work?

You've got it. I'm gonna check out the crib.
Don't scratch the paint.

Easy!

207
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,527
Hey, I like a woman who's assertive,

208
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,569
but don't you think
we should get to know each other first?

209
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,582
Guys! Can you believe this place?
It's the fucking bomb!

210
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,747
Look at this.
State-of-the-art stereo system!

211
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,128
Big-screen TV!

212
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,249
Aquarium. Hi, fishies.

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,078
I must be dreaming!
Somebody pinch me!

00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,670
Not you!

216
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,378
This is weird!

217
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,762
You shouldn't look directly at the camera.
We're supposed to act natural.

218
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,723
- At least, that's what the director said.
- Really?

219
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,310
Now, was this before or after
he died and made you God?

220
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,562
You must be Tom.

221
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,309
Which makes you...
Oh, help me out here.

00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,227
Tina Alvarez.

223
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,775
- Kyra Mitchell.
- Yeah! How did you know that?

224
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,115
A good actress always does her research
before she reports to the set.

225
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,360
- You're an actress?
- Erica Tyler.

226
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,487
- You've probably seen my work.
- Sorry.

227
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,081
But my mom doesn't let me watch
those kinds of movies.

228
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,876
Come on.
I'll give you guys the official tour.

229
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,715
It's a pretty nice place, actually.

230
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,052
- Tennis courts, wine cellar, library.
- A library?

231
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,799
Well, it's more like a shrine
to testosterone, if you ask me.

232
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,266
It's kind of creepy,
with all those deer heads.

233
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,016
- So, how was your trip out?
- Good.

234
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,861
Little vanski got us here smooth.
God, I'm trippin' on this place!

235
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,320
Hey.

236
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,617
I thought there was only five of us.

237
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,207
Excuse me.

238
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,715
Smile! You're on "Candid Camera"!

239
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,964
Oh, my God! The look on your face!

240
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,682
It's priceless!

241
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,972
Very funny, very funny!
Jesus!

242
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,347
Sorry, we just wanted to give you guys
a welcome to remember.

243
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,061

00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,518

245
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,190
- Ooh!
- I <i>will</i> be avenged.

246
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,405
Are you OK?

247
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,783
- Yeah. Fabulous.
- What is this shit?

248
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,823
It's pretty cool, huh?

249
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,250
I found it all up in the attic. Ooh!
There is some amazing stuff up there.

250
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,337
Whoah!

251
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:22,219
- And now, here comes the body electric.
- Woo!

252
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,713

253
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,856
Hey. Come on.

254
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,900
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

255
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,691

Hey, Kyra. Do you want me to unpack
some of your stuff?

260
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,813
- What are you doing?
- Oh! Just unpacking some of your stuff.

261
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,317
You don't have to do that.

262
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,026
- So, you're on medication?
- Yeah. It's just for anxiety.

263
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,318
It's no big deal.

264
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,366
Oh... So you're not like some kind
of head case or nothing, right?

265
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,415
Well, I have been known to bay at the moon
and sacrifice household pets,

266
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,626
but only on special occasions.

267
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,587
- That was a joke.
- Oh!

268
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,419
Tina, if you're not comfortable
sharing a room with me,

269
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,339
I'm sure we could get Erica to switch.

270
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,962
No! No, no. We're cool.

271
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,930
Listen, I'm gonna let you finish up here,

272
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,892
and I'm gonna go downstairs
to see what everybody else is doing.

273
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,635
OK? Later.

274
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,181
Later.

275
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,399
Who cares if she's on medication?

276
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,487
- Half of America is on Prozac, anyway.
- It's not just the pills!

277
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,197
She lives at Harvel House.
That's where I had to pick her up.

278
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,989
- Did you see what she did to her wrist?
- Whoah, wait. Harvel House?

279
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,205
- Where the freaks and psychos live?
- You're kidding? Like an asylum?

280
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,789
No, it's a group home.

281
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,410
It's for people who've had trouble in the past
and are ready to make a fresh start.

282
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:05,666
- Or in layman terms, freaks and psychos!
- Come on, guys. Give her a break.

283
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,670
The least we could do is try to be
a little understanding and supportive.

284
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,298
Fine, but if she starts pulling a Linda Blair,
somebody's getting beat down.

285
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,221
Hey, don't get me wrong,

286
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,936
I'm sure that one day, this little tête-à-tête
will make a great Springer episode,

287
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,684
but right now, my number one dilemma
is pizza or burgers?

288
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,936
I did see a couple of restaurants
on the way up.

289
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,404
You guys want to eat dinner now?
It's only 6:30.

290
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,694
Yeah, it's this wacky new concept
called nourishment.

291
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,158
All the cool kids are doing it.

292
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,029
Why don't we just get take-out? Then
everybody can eat whenever they want.

293
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:39,704
Or we could quit obsessing about food and
come up with a more constructive activity.

294
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,328
Oh, God! Well...

295
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,466
We... We could answer the door.

296
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,965
Don't get up. I got it.

297
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,915
'Ah, Kolobos!

298
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:29,257
'Today, I exist!'

299
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,996
What's up, chicken butt?
What you doing?

300
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,875
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry about that.

301
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,128
Mr. Director is downstairs
with two huge-ass pizzas.

302
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,051
- He wants us in the dining room pronto.
- I'll be down in a minute.

303
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,549
Hurry or there won't be any left.
Everyone's starving!

304
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,766
OK.

305
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,002
Oh, God!

306
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,458
OK.

307
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,302
That was nothing.
There's nothing back there.

308
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,638
You're safe.

309
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:05,095
I don't know what you're doing in there,
but hurry up or we're gonna start without you.

310
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,892
Damn it!

311
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,731
I'll be right there!

312
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,438
- Ooh!
- There's our missing link.

313
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,655
All right, now that we're all here,
I just wanted to drop these off

314
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,025
- and welcome you guys...
- Woo! Woo, woo, woo!

315
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,277
He hasn't said anything yet.

316
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,199
- Sorry.
- No, don't be.

317
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,744
You like what you hear,
you hoot and holler.

318
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:11,961
That's what this experiment is all about -
being yourselves and having a good time.

319
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,547
I wanted to find out if anyone had
any questions or requests.

320
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,213
Yeah. Do we get to hang out
in the control room?

321
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,971
Uh, you're more than welcome
to a little tour of the control room,

322
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,591
once I've worked all the bugs
out of the system,

323
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,764
but after that, you guys won't have
any interaction with me at all.

324
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,354
I think that would take you
out of the experience.

325
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,226
So, you guys get the whole house.
I get the trailer in the back.

326
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,229
- Fair enough.
- Any other questions?

327
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:43,869
All right, in that case, I hope this will be
interesting and, most of all, fun.

328
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,580
So, enjoy - and I'll be seeing you.

329
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,287
I'll show you to the door.

330
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,762
Nice speech, maestro.

331
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,679
So, what do you think?
Any break-out performances so far?

332
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,019
Well, I'm not one
to play favorites, but, uh...

333
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,855
I'd say there's one or two of you
who show some promise.

334
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,558
'Don't be so stingy
with that pineapple.'

335
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,722
'You already have four slices
on your plate.'

336
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,720
'I'm still growing!'

337
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,769
So, after Peter, Wendy and Captain Hook,
I got to walk out there.

338
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,903
And I bowed,
and my little wings sparkled.

339
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:08,870
I mean, it was such an incredible feeling
and I just knew right then, right there,

340
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,364
that was my calling.

341
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,618
- So, I got into high school...
- I hear actors are really self-centered

342
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,790
and only talk about themselves.

343
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,083
Is that true?

344
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,547
Generally, yes.

345
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:26,759
Been meaning to ask you, Tom.
What kind of comedian <i>are</i> you?

346
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,725
The kind who learned to be funny
so he wouldn't get his ass kicked at recess?

347
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,187
Or the sad little dreamer,
who honestly believes that, one day,

348
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:40,185
his lame little fart jokes will land him
a woman of the non-blow-up variety?

349
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:45,695
Judging from the way you've been sniffing
Tina's rosebuds for the past hour...

350
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,739
...I'd have to assume the latter.

351
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,863
Fine, fine. You get this round,
but only because I like you.

352
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,991
Oh-ho! I'm touched.

353
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,706
But you're right,
I'm hogging the spotlight.

354
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,749
Kyra? I hear you're an artist.

355
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,045
Says who?

356
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,385
Uh...

357
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,130
I don't remember.
You are, aren't you?

358
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,429
- I guess.
- But you're not sure?

359
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,346
- I just draw for myself.
- Can we see some of your stuff?

360
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,347
- Yeah!
- That'd be great.

361
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,818
Uh... Maybe some other time. I don't...
I haven't really shown it to anyone.

362
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,812
Show it to us, girl.

363
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,112
You know you want to, or you wouldn't
have brought your book down.

364
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,200
- I just wanted to finish something.
- Come on!

365
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,446
- Come on!
- Show it to us.

366
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,492
- OK.
- Yeah!

367
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,124
How long have you been drawing?

368
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,918
Forever.

369
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,042
Oh, wow! Who's that?

370
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,669
- A friend.
- Not too shabby.

371
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,551
The... The drawing, I mean.
The drawing.

372
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,343
- Wow!
- Hey! That's where I picked you up.

373
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,561
I've got one you might like even better.

374
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,854
- Wow!
- Oh, wow!

375
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,974
I always wanted one of these!

376
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,819
The guys that do them in amusement parks
make your face all trippy and shit.

377
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,812
I mean, this is really killer!

378
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,406
- Could you draw me?
- Sure.

379
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,151
I kind of think the left side of my face
is dominant.

380
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,075
Wow. I'm gonna get a frame for this one.
What do you think?

381
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,573
- Right.
- Yeah? All right.

382
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,370
- See if there's one of us.
- All right.

383
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,497
Whoah!

384
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,373
- Oh, my God!
- That's heavy.

385
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,886
Wow.

386
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,010
- What the hell are these?
- Give them back.

387
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,804
What do you care?
I just want to see...

388
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,973
God! Chill the fuck out!

389
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,846
Kyra.

390
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,154
- So, what are we watching again?
- "The Slaughterhouse Factor".

391
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,785
- You've never heard of it?
- Nope.

392
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:58,703
- Huh. Must be a cult thing.
- Have you done any real movies?

393
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,497
So, what are these films about?

394
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:10,298
Well, I play this woman, Fanny van Druven,
who was sexually abused as a child.

395
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,593
So, out of rage, I kill my parents
by burning the house down.

396
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:19,970
But... my body is never found,
so I become an urban legend.

397
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,478
15 years later, this group of teenagers
come back to town

398
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,727
and they decide to spend the night
at the house to party -

399
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,571
despite the fact that there's a curse
surrounding the whole place!

400
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,112
And despite the fact
that the house burned down.

401
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:37,195
Anyway, I come back
with this creepy ghoul mask on.

402
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,163
Agghh!

403
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,783
- And I kill everybody.
- Yeah, yeah.

404
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,955
So, it's a "Friday the 13th" rip-off.

405
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,205
No, it's totally different.
There's a female killer.

406
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,333
- Fanny van Dermin?
- Van Druven.

407
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,672
Actually, I think it's kind of cool,

408
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,013
cos most of the time, the women
in these movies are the screaming victims.

409
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,724
Aren't there screaming women
in these films, too?

410
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,969
No, no, no.
These are all the same, I'm telling ya.

411
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,893
I remember this one retarded movie where
this guy got killed with a tennis racquet.

412
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,811
Can you believe that shit?
When they found him, he was...

413
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,858
Hanging by the tennis strings.

414
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,399
You saw that crap, too?

415
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:19,996
"The Slaughterhouse Factor Part VI:
The Final Slaughter".

416
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,838
Oh, my God!

417
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,212
That was so terrible.

418
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,928
- I'm so embarrassed.
- No, no. This is fascinating.

419
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,478
I love the juxtaposition
between this scene and the last one.

420
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,848
It brought out the thematic design
of your character

421
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,646
and shed some light
on her psychological rationalization,

422
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,317
despite the mental hebephrenia
just hinted at earlier.

423
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,735
Do you think so?

424
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,904
This movie is so shitty!

425
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,119
And I love the lighting.

426
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,661
It heightens the suspense component
and, at the same time,

427
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,911
adds yet another visual layer to Franny's
already multi-faceted personage.

428
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,504
What the hell are you talking about?
This sucks.

429
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:15,089
He obviously doesn't appreciate
the artistic value of cinema.

430
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,337
Yes, especially when it sucks.

431
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,438
'Oh, God. She's dead.
What happened to her?'

432
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,775
'She's got a fork in her neck!
She's got a fork in her neck!'

433
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,777
Which one are we on?

434
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:08,373
"The Slaughterhouse Factor Part Ill:
Death Strikes Thrice".

435
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,537
Wow, we're only on number three?

436
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,706
- Does anybody want something to drink?
- Yeah, I'll take a soda, if there's any left.

437
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,083
How about a nice big cup of espresso?

438
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,381
These crappy films
are putting me to sleep.

439
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,631
How about a nice big cup
of "shut the fuck up"?

440
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,467
OK. One soda.

441
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,520
Not to insult you, Erica,

442
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:35,733
'because I really do enjoy your work,
but I gotta get to sleep.

443
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,439
'Good!'

444
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,319
'Oh, baby. Come on.

445
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,035
'Oh, yeah!'

446
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,322
'Oh, no! Agh!'

447
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,249
Oh, no.

448
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,412
Hey, Tina.
Hurry up, you're missing the best part.

449
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,049
What's the matter?

450
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,632
- Oh, my God!
- We have to get help.

451
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,767
What's going on?

452
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,683
Oh, my God!

453
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,104
Help me, Kyra. Please help me.

454
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,523
- Please.
- Oh, my God.

455
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,521
- Please.
- What happened?

456
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,193
What's the screaming abo...?

457
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,113
Jesus!

458
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,453
The line's... The phone line's dead.

459
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,446
What the hell's going on?

460
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,929
This can't be happening.
Is this some kind of a goddamn sick joke?

461
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,974
- Carl. We have to get Carl.
- The hell with Carl.

462
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,938
- We have to get outta here!
- Exactly!

463
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,557
No, don't!

464
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,021
Help! Help us!

465
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,866
Come on. Pull it together.

466
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,198
Carl! Please!

467
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,700
'Get us out of here!'

468
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:47,713
- 'He's filming us.'
- 'He'll come and get us. I know he will.'

469
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,335
Where the hell is he?

470
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,266
He's filming everything.

471
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,604
She's dead, isn't she?

472
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,241
No. She's alive, but just barely.

473
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,744
Oh, God.

474
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,323
The first thing we need to do
i-is... try and contain these wounds.

475
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,666
Then we'll think about
getting out of here.

476
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,747
Jesus Christ!
We can't just leave her like this!

477
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,967
OK, OK, you're right. Maybe we can get
some towels or something

478
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,007
and, I don't know, wrap her stomach
or hold her intestines in?

479
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,348
- I-I don't know.
- Good, Tom. There's a closet upstairs.

480
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,476
Fine.

481
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,687
You, Tom, stay with Tina.

482
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,774
You, come with me.
Yell if you see or hear anything.

483
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,643
Come on.

484
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,581
It's just the camera.

485
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,379
I don't know about this.

486
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,589
- Maybe we should go back.
- No, we're almost there. Come on.

487
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,906
You're OK. You're safe. You're safe.

488
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,533
- It's OK...
- What the hell are you doing?

489
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,413
Avoiding panic by maintaining rational
thought. It's a relaxation technique.

490
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:52,007
Your roommate got attacked by the kitchen.
I don't know how rational that is.

491
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,845
So, does it work?

492
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,636
The TV doesn't exactly help.

493
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,344
I'll get it.

494
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,688
Tom?

495
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,152
Here we go.

496
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,530
Wait, wait. It might be...

497
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,873
All right. Yeah.

498
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,380
OK. On three.

499
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,255
One.

500
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,972
Tom, this isn't funny.
Where the hell are you?

501
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,260
Kyra.

502
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,051
Help me.

503
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,304
Help me.

504
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,681
It's OK, Tina. Help's on the way.

505
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,400
Two.

506
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,653
Tom?

507
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,485
Three!

508
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,086
I can't see anything.

509
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,295
Wait a sec.

510
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,139
Tom?

511
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,938
Who's there?

512
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,663
- What happened?
- Tom, where the hell were you?

513
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,578
What are you talking about?
I've been standing right here.

514
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,575
Can you guys compare notes
on your own time?

515
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,577
Right now, Tina needs our help.

516
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,462
- Oh, my God!
- That's impossible.

517
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,550
- You were supposed to stay with her.
- We did.

518
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,387
- You didn't. You left.
- Left? I went to turn the TV off.

519
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,258
Next thing, Sybil here's screaming
her head off, runs out in the hall.

520
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,976
You guys come charging down
and suddenly we're in Vegas.

521
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:11,518
- Somebody's playing games with us.
- Gee, what tipped you off?

522
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,730
You guys! Can you believe
this place? It's the fucking bomb!

523
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,446
What's up, chicken butt?

524
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,492
It's coming from in there.

525
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,162
Kyra... Help me.

526
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,793
- Kyra, what are you doing?
- I'll get her.

527
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,675
Kyra...

528
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,608
'You'd better hurry up
or we're going to start without you.'

529
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,075
Shit!

530
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,453
Carl!

531
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,871
'Can you hear me?'

532
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,041
You're safe. Breathe. Breathe.

533
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,210
- Carl!
- Of course he can hear you.

534
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,755
That crazy fuck's probably
in the house with us right now.

535
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,005
- This whole set-up, it's like a...
- A snuff film?

536
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,475
- Yeah, and we're its goddamn stars.
- He wouldn't do that. It's not Carl.

537
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,488
She's not real.

538
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,152
She's not real!

539
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,114
Kyra! Kyra! Kyra!

540
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,991
Shh. You're OK.

541
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,286
She came at me.
She had some kind of a knife.

542
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,413
Kyra, there's no one here but us.

543
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,131
- You didn't see her?
- You were having an attack.

544
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,252
- You imagined it.
- No!

545
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,221
She was right here.
You can't tell me you didn't see her.

546
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,969
My pills.

547
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,344
- I think I need my pills.
- OK. We'll get them.

548
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,313
What? This guy's trying to kill us
and you want to stop for pharmaceuticals?

549
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,476
It'll only take a minute!

550
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,941
Yeah, it'll only take a minute
to get the fuck out of here.

551
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,435
Tom! Tom, wait!

552
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,857
Stop! I said don't move!

553
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,070
Oh, shit!

554
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,742
Walk towards me, Tom.

555
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,869
Walk towards me.

556
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,632
- Where'd you say those pills were?
- Let's go.

557
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,071
- Kyra, come on.
- They're not here.

558
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,320
- They're not here.
- Hey, hey. We'll find them.

559
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,239
Come on. I'll help you look.

560
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,748
Hey. Thanks, you know.

561
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,539
- Thanks for what you did back there.
- Forget about it.

562
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,583
- You would have done the same for me.
- Yeah, sure.

563
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,589
In theory.

564
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,252
Help me!

565
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,930
Please, somebody help me.

566
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,970
- Oh, my God.
- That sounds like...

567
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:46,190
'Please don't do it. I'll keep my mouth shut,
just let me walk out of here.'

568
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,688
Oh, my God.

569
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,190
'No!

570
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,113
'Don't do it! No!

571
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,908
'No, please! Dear God! Agh!'

572
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,037
- No!
- What the fuck was that?

573
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,565
Get him down!

574
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,077
Alex?

575
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:37,996
Alex?

576
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,662
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

577
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,955
Alex?

578
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,959
Who did this?

579
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,584
Kolobos.

580
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,054
Alex?

581
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,175
- Alex?
- Erica, what's going on?

582
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,350
How could this happen?
It was supposed to be simple.

583
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,316
- What was?
- It was just a job, a stupid job.

584
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,437
- We did it for the money.
- You're both actors?

585
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,736
- I don't believe it. She set us up!
- I didn't know anything about this.

586
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,699
You've been stringing us along
the whole time.

587
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:18,070
- This was not the plan.
- Then what was?

588
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,078
I don't know. Alex got me the job.

589
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:26,078
He... He said that there might be
some surprises along the way,

590
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,875
but I should just play along.

591
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:31,045
- Who hired you?
- Don't tell me you're buying this crap?

592
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:34,045
This project had an investor.
I never met him.

593
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,763
She's lying. It's one of her platinum
performances.

594
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:40,180
No, I believe her. She's not that good
an actress. No offence.

595
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,140
OK. Fine.

596
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,015
If it's not Carl or Alex
or whatever the fuck his name is,

597
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,142
who the fuck is knocking people off?

598
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:52,396
- It could be anybody. This investor guy.
- Yeah, yeah, maybe one of us.

599
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:56,741
No, look, stop pointing the finger.
Let's just figure out a way to get out of here.

600
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,612
How? All the doors and windows are sealed.

601
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,244
Then we'll go up.

602
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,668
The attic.

603
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,045
The attic. Yeah, OK.

604
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,416
But just make sure you watch your back.

605
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:19,135
- I'll find out who did this.
- Come on, Erica. Let's go.

606
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,234
I think it's OK up here.

607
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,154
This place is a goddamn fun house.

608
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,571
Kyra.

609
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:02,318
Kyra...

610
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,502
What happened?

611
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,050
Nothing.
I... I just don't like this. It's...

612
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,669
It's too dark.

613
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,486
Hey. May... Maybe we can punch
through the roof.

614
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,669
Wait a minute. What is that?

615
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,342
There's a metal plate lining the roof.

616
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:09,764
- Fucking shit! Shit!
- We're never gonna break through that.

617
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,369
Did you hear that?

618
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,916
- Hear what?
- It was a creaking sound, footsteps.

619
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,634
- Was it one of us?
- It came from over there.

620
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,298
Are you sure?

621
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,093
- If someone else is in...
- Shh!

622
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,827
Jesus! Take it easy.
There's no one up here.

623
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,116
- Are you OK?
- Was she ever?

624
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,832
I don't know what's going on, Gary,
but I saw someone. I know I did.

625
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,418
- Even downstairs with Tina.
- Who? Who did you see?

626
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,755
I don't know. It was a man.
He cut his face off.

627
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,921
- It was like something...
- No, no, no. Shh. Shh.

628
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,045
It's OK.

629
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:31,808
Look, we're all scared right now,
but we're going to get out of here.

630
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,847
In the meantime,
stick with me and you'll be OK.

631
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,027
Gary?

632
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,192
I'm right here.

633
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,952
- Did you hear that?
- It's nothing, Kyra.

634
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,822
There it is again.

635
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,415
I don't hear anything.

636
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,375
Oh, my God!
It's him! He's up here!

637
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,594
Tom?

638
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,934
Erica?

639
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,644
Where's Gary?

640
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,329
Gary!

641
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,127
There's no way in hell
we're gonna get this panel open.

642
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,196
Oh, my God.

643
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,150
Come and look at this.

644
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,536
Jesus!

645
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,710
This looks like Kyra's drawing.

646
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,504
What the hell are they doing up here?

647
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,300
Kyra?

648
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,972
- She's not up here.
- Neither is Gary.

649
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,104
No!

650
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,128
Ugh!

651
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,967
No!

652
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,053
Agh!

653
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:35,634
Are you having bad dreams?
Don't be afraid.

654
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,387
Bad dreams are only dreams.

655
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:43,514
Just tell yourself it isn't real
and the demons will go away.

656
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,346
Kyra?

657
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,985
Do you mind closing the curtain?

658
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,321
That girl is freaking me out.

659
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,073
How are you this evening?

660
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,703
Not too good, huh?

661
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:10,287
Well, I just wanted to let you know that
the police are checking everything out.

662
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,210
I assure you, everything's going to be OK.

663
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,966
We'll take good care of you.

664
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,679
Kyra...

665
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,600
Kyra, when did you do this to yourself?

666
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,396
How many times have you tried this?

667
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:34,319
Kyra?
I'd like to talk to you about this, Kyra.

668
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,990
Why would you do something like this
to yourself?

669
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,526
Kolobos.

670
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,742
Today... we...

671
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,907
...exist.

672
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,046
- What have you got?
- Just the bottom.

673
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,208
- You?
- Still looking.

674
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,336
Hey, check the door.

675
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,720
Tom.

676
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,842
- Don't fucking move.
- What's going on?

677
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,103
You tell us.

678
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,727
Where's Gary?

679
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,149
Oh, God! Gary!

680
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,444
Let me guess.
You've no idea what happened, right?

681
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,914
I saw a man drag Gary into the bathroom.
They were fighting and then...

682
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,331
I don't know,
somebody hit me over the head and I...

683
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,169
I must have blacked out.

684
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,584
- Oh, that's convenient!
- It's the truth.

685
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,958
He punched a hole through that door.

686
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,255
A hole?

687
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,471
You must have heard them.
Gary was screaming...

688
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,888
All I know is we came down to find Gary gone
and you here looking like that.

689
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,769
But I...

690
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,648
No.

691
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,893
- You can't think...
- Tom.

692
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,194
- Ah, shit!
- Erica!

693
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,363
- No. I didn't...
- Spare us the wide-eyed innocent routine.

694
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,784
You killed him,
just like you killed Tina and Alex.

695
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,952
- Please, you have to believe me.
- Bullshit!

696
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,825
We know exactly what you've done.

697
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,832
And what you're capable of doing.

698
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,626
Who did these?

699
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,089
They're yours.

700
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,585
Are you too fucked in the head
to even recognize your own work?

701
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:24,762
I don't remember.

702
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,508
They're just drawings.
They don't mean anything.

703
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,509
Three people are dead.
That means something to me.

704
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,433
The only thing that means
anything to her are these.

705
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,397
- Where'd you get those?
- In your drawer.

706
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,266
Funny. I thought they were lost.

707
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,190
It's a good excuse to flip out and go on
a killing spree, don't you think?

708
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,813
Give them back.

709
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,440
You want 'em?
Come and get 'em.

710
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,280
You crazy bitch!

711
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,995
No!

712
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:57,959
- Tom! Erica, let me out!
- You just gonna leave her in there?

713
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,422
- You have a better idea?
- I don't know.

714
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,088
It's one thing to think something
and another to actually do it.

715
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,008
- What if she's telling the truth?
- What if she's not?

716
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,098
Look, if she isn't the killer,
then she definitely knows who is.

717
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,264
Either way, she's a menace.

718
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,687
Look, I don't know about you...

719
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,815
but I feel safer already.

720
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,864
So, what now?

721
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,403
We have to check the basement.

722
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,618
The basement? Are you crazy?
We have to go through the kitchen.

723
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,578
We don't have much choice.

724
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,790
If the kitchen is that booby-trapped,
it's gotta be the way out.

725
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,878
Hey, you wanna stay here
and ask Kyra for help?

726
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,386
That's it over there.

727
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,259
How can I be sure you're not in on this?

728
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,432
Fuck you, Tom!
We've already been through this!

729
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,647
How do I know the whole deal with Kyra
isn't just a set-up?

730
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,766
Maybe you could have thrown me
in that goddamn trap.

731
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,938
- Fuck that, Miss Fanny van Druven!
- If I was the killer,

732
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,813
how could I have done anything to Gary?

733
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,985
I was with you in the attic
the whole time.

734
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,617
Look, Tom,

735
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:55,864
the only way we're gonna get out of here
alive is if we trust each other.

736
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,910
Please.

737
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,706
How do you get to the basement?

738
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,466
- We make a run for it.
- No, seriously.

739
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,756
I don't think we have a choice!

740
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,629
Look, are you with me or not?

741
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,427
OK.

742
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,108
Just focus on the door.

743
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,148
Ready?

744
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,230
Go!

745
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,995
- Tom!
- Shit! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

746
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,836
Kyra.

747
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,256
Kyra, are you listening?

748
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,467
Now you've done it!

749
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,633
This is what happens to little girls
who refuse to play along.

750
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:58,726
- That was terrible!
- But I... I didn't do anything wrong! No!

751
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,640
No. You're not there.

752
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:03,014
I'm alone! I'm alone!

753
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,396
Leave me alone!

754
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,154
I've got a present for you.

755
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,653
Your old friend. Pick it up.

756
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,076
Go ahead. Pick it up.

757
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,663
- Pick it up.
- Shut up!

758
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:26,708
- I'm not afraid of you.
- You should be.

759
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,335
No.

760
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,801
You're not real.
There's nothing wrong with me!

761
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,670
There's nothing wrong with me!

762
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,550
There's nothing wrong with me.

763
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,610
It's locked.
I need you to come help me op...

764
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,273
Tom?

765
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,541
Tom?

766
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,903
No! No! No!

767
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,658
No! No!

768
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,355
There, there.

769
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,353
Stop! No! Please!

770
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,857
Tom, it's OK.
Stop! It's me. Are you OK?

771
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:03,111
- Where the hell did you just come from?
- The bathroom, remember?

772
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,951
- How'd you get out?
- I beat the door into submission.

773
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,415
Let me take a look.

774
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:11,035
You're the one who whacked me
over the back of the head.

775
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,789
You were out cold. If I wanted to kill you
I could have sliced you into ribbons.

776
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:19,877
Oh, God.

777
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,595
It doesn't look too bad.

778
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,223
- Where's Erica?
- I don't know.

779
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,185
She went into the kitchen.
That's the last I remember.

780
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,889
What the hell?

781
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:34,517
- What?
- The door's open. The lasers are off.

782
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,769
It's clear.
She must have gone through the door.

783
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,520
Is that the way out?

784
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,981
I don't know.

785
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,616
There's only one way to find out.

786
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,325
I'm not so sure I want to.

787
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,816
We'll check the windows in here, OK?

788
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,813
Yes.

789
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,417
Tom, can you give me a boost up?

790
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:50,218
Tom! Tom, answer me!

791
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,694
Oh.

792
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,358
Eugh!

793
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,285
Kyra. Hey, Kyra!

794
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:23,463
'Agh! A good actress always does
her research... I kill everybody.'

795
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,756
'That's what this experiment
is all about.'

796
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,972
'Real learning comes from
being out there, doing things.'

797
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,342
'I'm not some kind of actress
or anything like that.

798
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,560
'I've got that progressive-minded
shit down!'

799
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:37,022
- 'Can we see some of your stuff?'
- 'I hear you're an artist.'

800
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,151
'Kolobos!

801
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:46,858
'Today, you exist.'

802
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,533
No!

803
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,050
Stop. Stop.

804
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,079
Finally, they exist.

805
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,374
Why?

806
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:42,038
I freed them from their shells.

807
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,207
Like you did.

808
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,301
They're just drawings!

809
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,762
No. No.

810
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,179
You feel their inner truth.

811
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,561
No, you killed them!

812
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:04,435
I... I gave them back their true form.

813
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,439
Just... Just like I did to myself.

814
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,652
Why don't you kill me, too?

815
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,200
You're not like them.

816
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,948
You don't need to die.

817
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,506
Kolobos.

818
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,727
Today, you exist.

819
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:42,560
'You're not some kind of
head case or nothing?'

820
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:44,809
- '...had some trouble in the past.'
- 'Nothing wrong with me.'

821
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,526
'Did you see what she did
to her wrists?'

822
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:47,895
'Freaks and psychos.'

823
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,113
'You don't even recognize
your own work.'

824
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,261
Agh!

825
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,055
Good morning, Kyra.

826
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,226
- Good morning.
- How are you feeling?

827
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,687
- Much better.
- Good.

828
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:06,352
I've brought your release papers,
so you're all set to go.

829
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:12,025
- These are yours.
- Any word from Detective Byers?

830
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,149
You want to sit down for a minute?

831
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,578
Did they find him?

832
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,288
Detective Byers checked out the address
that you gave him,

833
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,157
- and they...
- Did they find the others?

834
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:28,503
The house belongs to an elderly couple
who's lived there for over 22 years.

835
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:32,250
There was no snow, one story,
no basement,

836
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:33,626
no upstairs.

837
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:36,253
- That's impossible.
- They checked the entire area.

838
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,473
They couldn't find anything that matched
the information that you gave him.

839
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,262
They must have made a mistake.

840
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:45,104
- I know what happened.
- Then clear something up for me.

841
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:49,066
When you were brought in, there was a word
that you kept repeating - Kolobos.

842
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,193
Does that ring a bell?

843
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:57,112
Well, at the suggestion of a colleague,
I looked it up.

844
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:01,370
The word actually comes
from an Ancient Greek term

845
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:05,366
which, when distilled into modern lingo,
basically means "mutilated".

846
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:07,914
- I wanna go home.
- Kyra.

847
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:12,631
Whatever happened to you,
I'm sure it was really scary.

848
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,421
And a traumatic event like that
can trigger old memories.

849
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,966
Are you saying I made this up?
That I'm lying?

850
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:21,932
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I just want to make sure that you're safe.

851
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,395
From what?
Someone nobody believes exists?

852
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,390
- I didn't say I didn't believe you.
- You think I did this to myself?

853
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,896
Why? To get attention?

854
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,146
I did it to my wrists, so why not my face?

855
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,115
Kyra, I never said any of that.

856
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,450
I only want to help you.

857
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,991
Now, I have a dear friend
that you could go see.

858
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:45,284
His offices are close by you,

859
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,658
so I took the liberty of making
an appointment for you.

860
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,414
- Kyra, all I want you to do is see...
- No. Goodbye.

861
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,458
- At least think about it.
- No!

862
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:37,317
'Kyra, help me.

863
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,528
'Help me.'

864
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,104
Damn it!

865
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,184
It's only me.

866
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,007
'No!

867
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,385
'No! No! No!

868
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,686
'No!'

869
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,644
'Kyra!

870
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,439
'Ky-ra!'

871
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,772
It's only me.

872
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,831
'Whoah!

873
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:45,914
'Touch me.

874
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,254
'Touch me, Kyra.

875
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,760
'Please touch me.

876
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:00,307
'Kyra, touch me.'

877
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,732
'No!'

878
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,409
'Kyra.

879
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,703
'Kyra, touch me.

880
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:24,293
'Touch me now.

881
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,458
'Touch me.

882
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,135
'Yes.

883
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,560
'Ooh, yes, Kyra.

884
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,853
'Kyra, touch me.

885
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,477
'Oh, yes, Kyra.

886
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,238
'I'm thirsty, Kyra.'

887
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:54,574
Don't worry. I'm here.

888
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,208
'Ooh, you like it.

889
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,797
'Huh? Don't you?'

890
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:13,134
- Yes.
- 'Yes, do you... Do you want more?'

891
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:16,470
'Oh.

892
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:20,718
'There is something I want you to do.'

893
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,139
I know.

894
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,531
'Kolobos.

895
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,321
'It means "mutilated".

896
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,411
'Some would say it's what Zeus did

897

'when he severed the first creatures
who roamed the Earth in two,

898

'condemning them to wander
in search for their better half.

'But others believe
he created divine beauty

900
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:53,967
'for, in severing the beasts,
he created man and woman.

901
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,547
Yes. I'd like to place an ad.

902
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:35,666
Uh-huh.

903
