00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:19,868
ROBIN,
SHE'S A NICE GIRL.

168
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:21,868
MAKE SURE SHE STAYS
THAT WAY.

169
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,167
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

170
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,534
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
- THANKS.

MR. SPARROW,
ANIMAL-CONTROL
REGULATIONS STATE

196
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:56,601
THAT ANY OFFICER SUFFERING
AT THE HANDS OF AN ANIMAL

197
00:14:56,601 --> 00:15:00,033
MUST UNDERGO PSYCHOLOGICAL
COUNSELING WITHIN SEVEN DAYS

198

200
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,200
CAN'T BLAME A CREATURE
OF LOWER INTELLIGENCE FOR THAT.

201
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,367
I MADE A MISTAKE, OKAY?
WRITE THAT DOWN.
I MADE A MISTAKE.

202
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,300
IT'S MY FAULT--
LIKE WHEN I TOLD MY WIFE

203
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,067
SHE COULD CHOOSE THE COLOR

204
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,300

205
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,000

 <i>RACED.</i>

- NO.

302
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:11,534

- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERY TIME I READ A BOOK,

303
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:15,501
IT'S LIKE, THE AUTHOR
STOLE A PART OF ME THAT
I THOUGHT ONLY I KNEW.

304
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,334
SOMEDAY I'M GONNA WRITE
A BOOK AND I'LL DO IT

I DON'T KNOW, HON.
IT'S-- IT'S JUST REALLY

306

- KIND OF STRANGE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

307
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,968
THERE'S A LOT

WITH DOGS NEXT DOOR?

310
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:33,367
OH, YOUR NEIGHBOR HAD A DOG.
WELL, THAT'S SHOCKING.

311
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:36,400
( scoffs )
IT WASN'T CALLED ALFIE.
IT WAS CALLED CHIEF.

312
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
"MIS-CHIEF"
MY FATHER CALLED IT.

313
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,934
HE USED TO ESCAPE ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S WHY I BECAME AN A.C.O.

314

FINGERLING'S A DETECTIVE.

315
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:46,334

MY MOM.

318

ON MY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY.

THAT FINGERLING IS
NOTHING LIKE YOU.

322
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:06,234
SOMEBODY WROTE A BOOK
ABOUT DAD?

323
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:09,100
- NO.
- YES. YES.

00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:48,200
- HAVE YOU
FINISHED THE BOOK?
- NOT YET.

483
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,300
YOU'VE CONCERNED
YOURSELF WITH MINUTIA

484
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,634
AND YOU'VE DRAWN WILD
CONCLUSIONS FROM THEM.

485
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:54,868
WHAT ABOUT
THE FACT THAT FINGERLING
BECOMES A KILLER?

486
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,901
- A KILLER?
- AND JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE YOU KILLED?

487
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:59,234
WAIT, WHO GETS
KILLED?

488
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:00,901
ASK MR. FINGERLING.

489
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:02,767
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

490
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:08,000
WHY THIS COLOR?

491
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,667
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
THIS COLOR?

492
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,634
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU TELL ME.

493
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:15,667
RED NUMBER FIVE--
R-E-D IS 27,

494
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,300
PLUS FIVE IS 32
WHICH IS--

495
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,601
YOU'RE REACHING NOW.

496
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,601
SURE, THERE ARE
DIFFERENCES.

497
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,834
FINGERLING'S A DETECTIVE,
I'M A DOG CATCHER;

498
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,167
HE MET FABRIZIA
WHEN HE WAS 32,

499
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,634
WHEREAS I MET YOU
WHEN I WAS--

500
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:30,634
- 23.
- AND THE DAY
WE MET WAS?

501
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:33,300
- SEPTEMBER 14th.
- 9/14.

502
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,767
- 14 PLUS 9 IS?
- 23!

503
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:40,200
( sighs )
WE MARRIED
OCTOBER 13th--

504
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,167
10/13, 23.

505
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,934
SUICIDE BLONDE SAID
IT RULED HER WORLD.

506
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:47,701
SHE KILLED BECAUSE OF IT.
THEN SHE HANDED IT
ON TO FINGERLING

507
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,100
ON HIS 32nd BIRTHDAY--
23 REVERSED.

508
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,734
FINGERLING CALLED IT FATE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT FATE IS?

509
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,133
( whispers )
32.

510
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:56,868
I REST MY CASE,
YOUR HONOR.

511
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:01,334
- HONEY, I THINK YOU'RE
TAKING THIS TOO SERIOUSLY.
- WAIT WAIT WAIT

512
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:03,434
WAIT WAIT WAIT.
WE LIVE AT 1814.

513
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:05,934
I MEAN, 18 IS
ONE PLUS EIGHT
WHICH EQUALS NINE.

514
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:08,501
 <i>AND NINE PLUS 14</i>
 <i>IS ALSO 23.</i>

515
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:11,167
 <i>14 IS ONE PLUS FOUR</i>
 <i>WHICH EQUALS FIVE.</i>

516
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:13,234
AND FIVE PLUS
18 IS 23 TOO.

517
00:33:13,234 --> 00:33:15,467
- OH MY GOD.
- ALL RIGHT, ROBIN,

518
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,033
PLEASE DON'T YOU
START THIS NONSENSE.

519
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:21,434
THIS IS NOT NONSENSE!
I-I MEAN, FIVE PLUS
18 <i>IS</i> 23.

520
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,133
WELL, IF THE BOOK
WERE 27 OR 150,

521
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,300
YOU COULD DO
THE SAME THING.

522
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,601
18 PLUS 14 IS 32.

523
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:31,801
23 REVERSED.
( sighs )

524
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,467
SPOOKY, HUH?

525
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,367

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

550
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,734
READING.

551
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:24,901
YOU'RE INSANE.

552
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:16,567

553
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:21,934
- ISAAC?
- Isaac: <i>SIMPLY PUT,</i>

556
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:31,033
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
WILHELM REICH NEXT WEEK.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

557
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:34,033
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A FASCINATING READ.

558
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:36,000
OF COURSE THERE EXIST
FAR TOO FEW BOOKS

559
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,834
WHERE THE MAIN
CHARACTER PLAYS
THE SAXOPHONE.

560
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,801
I WASN'T AWARE
YOU ALSO PLAYED.

561
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,100
I DON'T.
THAT'S JUST IT,
IT DOESN'T ALL MATCH.

562
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,434
IT'S THE NUMBER.
I'M SEEING IT EVERYWHERE.

563
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:48,934
WELL, CONSPIRACY BUFFS
WOULD SAY, "OF COURSE.

564
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,033
AFTER ALL, THE WORLD
SPINS IN AN AXIS OF 23°."

565
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:54,501
WHEN YOU TELL THEM IT'S
ACTUALLY 23.5, THEY SAY

566
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:57,567
FIVE IS SIMPLY TWO PLUS THREE.

567
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:03,067
( chuckles )
23 IS VERY GOOD
AT THIS PARTICULAR GAME.

568
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:06,033
- GAME?
- YEAH, PARANOIA.

569
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:10,968
- THERE'S A FAIR BIT OF
LITERATURE ON THE 23 ENIGMA.
- THERE IS?

570
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:14,133
THERE ARE 23 AXIOMS
TO EUCLID'S GEOMETRY.

571
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,801
THE HUMAN BODY CONSISTS
OF 46 CHROMOSOMES--

572
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:21,100
23 FROM EACH PARENT.

573
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,801
BLOOD TAKES 23 SECONDS

574
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,901
THE MAYANS BELIEVED
THE END OF THE WORLD

575
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:30,367
WOULD OCCUR DECEMBER
12th, 2012.

576
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:32,467
20 PLUS 12 IS?

577
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:34,701
23 REVERSED.

578
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:37,234
OR 20 PLUS ONE
PLUS TWO.

579
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:38,968
SO WHAT IS THIS?

580
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:41,567
WHAT IS 23?

581
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:44,434
IS IT...

582
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:46,501
GOD?

583
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:48,267
Isaac:
 <i>TWO DIVIDED BY THREE--</i>

584
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:50,634
.666.

585
00:38:50,634 --> 00:38:54,167
 <i>666, THE NUMBER</i>
 <i>OF THE DEVIL.</i>

586
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:57,267
 <i>THERE ARE ONLY 22 CHAPTERS</i>
 <i>IN THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS.</i>

587
00:38:57,267 --> 00:39:00,801
 <i>WE ALL KNOW</i>
 <i>HOW THAT ENDS.</i>

588
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:03,100
SO IS 23
A BLESSING OR A CURSE?

589
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,267
WHAT'S TRUE IS THAT
THERE'S A SELECT GROUP
OF PEOPLE

590
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:09,000
THAT TAKE DELIGHT
IN PERPETUATING
THE NUMBER'S INFAMY.

591
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,834
LUCKY SEVEN,
UNLUCKY 13,

592
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:14,167
BALLPLAYERS,
LUCKY SHOES.

593
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:17,868
PEOPLE ONLY PRAY
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT GOD
WILL HELP THEM IF THEY DO.

594
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:20,667
THIS IS MAGICAL
THINKING,

595
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:23,067
NON-SCIENTIFIC
CAUSAL REASONING.
NOW YOU'RE--

596
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:26,000
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 23
SO YOU'RE FINDING IT.

597
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,033
( chuckles )
AGATHA THINKS
I'M NUTS.

598
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:32,801
( laughs )
FINISH THE BOOK.

599
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,501
AND IF AFTER READING IT
IN ITS ENTIRETY,

600
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,100
YOU STILL BELIEVE
THE SUBJECT TO BE YOU,

601
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,767
THEN WHOEVER WROTE IT
KNOWS YOU VERY WELL.

602
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:42,434
AND ONLY <i>THEY</i> CAN
GIVE YOU YOUR ANSWER.

603
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:44,968
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
- AND IN THE MEANTIME

604
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,067
I CAN SPEAK TO AGATHA,
IF YOU LIKE.

605
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:50,534
HMM.

606
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:53,367
( moaning )

607
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:58,100
Walter's voice:
 <i>THE NUMBER WAS EVERYWHERE.</i>

608
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,501
YOU HAVE 23 PAIRS
OF SHOES.

609
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,601
YOU'RE COUNTING
MY SHOES?

610
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:16,767
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- READING.

611
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,567
YOU'RE INSANE.

612
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:36,467

 <i>"NIGHT AFTER NIGHT I KILLED</i>

 <i>SHRINK WHAT HER FULL NAME</i>
 <i>ADDED UP TO."</i>

614
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:43,300
- 23.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT MEANS?

615
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,701
I DON'T KNOW,
MILES.

616
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:50,767
MAYBE I SHOULD BE
A FUCKING ACCOUNTANT.

617
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:54,601
Walter's voice:
 <i>"THE WISE DR. PHOENIX</i>

THE HIROSHIMA BOMB

00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:24,567
PRETTY SOON,
SHE STOPS COMING TOO.

807
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,601
EVENTUALLY, YOUR--

808
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:30,567
YOUR FATHER TELLS
YOU YOUR SISTER
HAD A BREAKDOWN...

809
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,734
UNABLE TO DEAL
WITH HAVING A MURDERER

810
00:59:34,734 --> 00:59:36,667
FOR A BROTHER.

811
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:39,067
NOW THERE'S TEARS
IN HIS EYES WHEN
HE SAYS THIS,

812
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:42,467
BUT HE'S NOT SAD.

813
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:45,000
HE'S ANGRY.

814
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,834
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
YOU EVER SEE HIM.

815
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:53,567
I DIDN'T KILL LAURA.

816
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:55,701
I LOVED HER.

817
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:58,701
AND I DIDN'T WRITE A BOOK
ABOUT A NUMBER.

818
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:04,267
YOU'RE LYING.

819
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:08,234
I'M IN PRISON FOR A CRIME
I DID NOT COMMIT,
MR. SPARROW.

820
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:13,901
BUT SOMEHOW I THINK
YOUR PROBLEMS ARE
BIGGER THAN MINE.

821
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:19,701
FUCKING LIAR!

822
01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:24,501
NO.
YEAH, NO.

823
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:29,901
IF I WAS
TO WRITE A BOOK,

824
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:33,567
I WOULDN'T USE A RIDICULOUS
NAME LIKE "TOP SECRETS."

825
01:00:40,968 --> 01:00:42,968
 <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

826
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:47,033
 <i>( door closes )</i>

827
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:59,734
HE WAS REAL CONVINCING
ABOUT HIS INNOCENCE.

828
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:01,667
WELL, KILLERS
USUALLY ARE.

829
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:03,868
HIS FINGERPRINTS WERE
ON THE KNIFE.

830
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,167
HER BLOOD WAS
ON HIS HANDS WHEN
HE DIALED 911.

831
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:09,734
- NO, HE'S INNOCENT.
- <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>

832
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:14,934
ALL BECAUSE HIS NAME
DOESN'T ADD UP TO 23?

833
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:17,767
THE REAL KILLER,
THE AUTHOR, HE'S STILL
OUT THERE.

834
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:20,000
I HAVE TO FIND HIM.

835
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,434
WAIT, I--I--I--I KNOW
HOW YOU CAN FIND HIM.

836
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,167
Robin:
 <i>LAST NIGHT W-WHEN I WAS</i>
 <i>READING THE BOOK,</i>

837
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:34,968
 <i>I FOUND A P.O. BOX</i>
 <i>ADDRESS IN THE BACK.</i>

838
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,834
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANYTHING IN THIS?
- JUST THE SNOW.

839
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:48,868
- WHEN DO YOU WANT IT
TO GET THERE?
- TOMORROW MORNING.

840
01:01:48,868 --> 01:01:51,367
- IT'LL HAVE TO GO EXPRESS.
- FINE.

841
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:52,934
IS THAT ALL?

842
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:54,968
NO NO, WE WANT A--

843
01:01:54,968 --> 01:01:57,534
WE WANT 23 OF THEM.

844
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,701
I DREAMT THAT
I KILLED YOU, AG.

845
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:08,234
- FINGERLING HAD
THE SAME DREAM ABOUT--
- SHH.

846
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:11,133
I'M GOING
WITH YOU TODAY.

847
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:13,701
AND ALL THIS
IS GONNA COME TO AN END.

848
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:17,801
YOU WOULDN'T HURT ME,
WALTER.

849
01:02:19,767 --> 01:02:23,200
YOU WOULDN'T HURT
ANYONE EVER.

850
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,100
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

851
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:40,033
THERE'S YOUR BOXES,
KIDDO.

852
01:02:40,033 --> 01:02:42,868
NOW WE'LL SEE
IF SOMEBODY SHOWS UP.

853
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:47,534
THIS MAY NOT BE THE AUTHOR.
HE MAY NOT EVEN BE A MAN.

854
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:52,133
WELL, WE'LL KNOW
SOON ENOUGH.

855
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:17,534
- WALTER, LOOK.
- HUH?

856
01:03:17,534 --> 01:03:19,534
SOMEBODY'S GONE IN.

857
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,234
Robin: <i>THAT'S HIM.</i>
 <i>I-IT'S GOTTA BE HIM.</i>

858
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:27,701
- Walter: <i>YOU THINK?</i>
- <i>YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.</i>

859
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:29,734
IT'S GOTTA BE HIM.

860
01:03:36,133 --> 01:03:38,167
GAME'S OVER,
TOPSY KRETTS.

861
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,934
YOU SH--
SHOULD BE DEAD.

862
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,534
YOU SHOULD BE DEAD!

863
01:03:58,033 --> 01:04:01,234
- WALTER, NO!
- I'M CALLING THE COPS!

864
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:04,234
STOP!
WHO ARE YOU?

865
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:06,767
THE NUMBER,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

866
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:09,334
I THINK YOU KNOW.

867
01:04:09,334 --> 01:04:12,868
( groans )

868
01:04:12,868 --> 01:04:14,601
- OH MY GOD.
GET AN AMBULANCE!
- WATCH OUT!

869
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:18,567
- DEAR GOD.
- GET AN AMBULANCE!

870
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:20,367
Walter:
 <i>DON'T YOU DIE ON ME.</i>

871
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:22,801
YOU HEAR ME?
DON'T YOU DIE.

872
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:24,767
WALTER, PLEASE.

873
01:04:24,767 --> 01:04:27,968
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON
THAT CAN HELP US GET
BACK TO NORMAL.

874
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,901
HONEY, YOU'RE NOT
HELPING, OKAY?

875
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:32,601
NOW I WANT YOU
TO TAKE ROBIN
AND GO HOME.

876
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:34,467
THIS MAN NEEDS
A HOSPITAL.

877
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:37,734
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
- BUT HE KNOWS, HON.

878
01:04:37,734 --> 01:04:39,901
TAKE ROBIN
AND GO HOME.

879
01:04:39,901 --> 01:04:43,701
I SAID I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT.

880
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,634
HE KNOWS.

881
01:04:50,634 --> 01:04:52,734
SHIT!

882
01:04:52,734 --> 01:04:54,834
HARD TO GET RID OF...

883
01:04:54,834 --> 01:04:57,767
- WHAT?
- I WAS INSANE.

884
01:04:57,767 --> 01:04:59,434
WHAT WAS DRIVING
YOU INSANE?

885
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:02,267
HARD...

886
01:05:02,267 --> 01:05:05,067
TO GET RID OF...

887
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,467
( gasps )

888
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:09,901
THE INSTITUTE.

889
01:05:09,901 --> 01:05:13,000
GO THERE.

890
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,667
YOU'LL SEE.

891
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:17,300
OH MY GOD.

892
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,567
 <i>( siren wailing )</i>

893
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:29,234
( telephone rings )

894
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:31,734
- AGATHA.
- WALTER, HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

895
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:33,334
I'M SO SORRY.

896
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:35,534
 <i>Well, did he say</i>
 <i>anything?</i>

897
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:38,501
NO, I'M SORRY.

898
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:41,133
DID YOU FIND OUT
WHO HE WAS?

899
01:05:41,133 --> 01:05:43,701
 <i>No.</i>

900
01:05:43,701 --> 01:05:46,868
I'LL BE HOME
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

901
01:05:46,868 --> 01:05:49,000
( hangs up )

902
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,667
( water dripping )

903
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,400
- ( wings flapping )
- ( gasps )

904
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:20,467
OH, SHIT!

905
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,133
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

906
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,567
ROBIN!

907
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,534
EVERY 23rd WORD
ON EVERY 23rd PAGE:

908
01:08:28,534 --> 01:08:32,367
"VISIT CASANOVA SPARK,
DIG BENEATH THE STEPS
TO HEAVEN."

909
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,701
- WHO'S CASANOVA SPARK?
- IT'S NOT A PERSON.

910
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:39,200
"I WARN YOU, HELL IS
WAITING, SPARROW MAN."

911
01:08:41,067 --> 01:08:43,334
WE NEED TO GO.

912
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:07,234
( mumbling )

913
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:19,734
( mumbling )

914
01:09:19,734 --> 01:09:21,734
Man: <i>23!</i>

915
01:09:27,067 --> 01:09:30,234
( mumbling )

916
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:37,634
Agatha:
 <i>WHAT WAS DRIVING YOU INSANE?</i>

917
01:09:58,033 --> 01:09:59,801
( gasps )

918
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:12,901
WANNA TAKE BETS THAT
THERE'S 23 OF THEM?

919
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:21,801
20, 21, 22...

920
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:28,501
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

921
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:34,667
WHAT IF MOM WAS RIGHT?

922
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,501
WH-WH-WHAT IF-- WHAT IF
THE MAN WASN'T THE AUTHOR?

923
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:39,901
WHAT-- WHAT IF HE WAS
JUST THE GUY'S FATHER
OR SOMETHING?

924
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:42,334
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT
OF WHAT IFS.

925
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:45,601
WOULDN'T THAT MEAN
THAT THE REAL KILLER'S
STILL OUT THERE?

926
01:10:53,434 --> 01:10:56,467
Robin:
 <i>DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?</i>

927
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:59,801
YOU'RE STARTING
TO SOUND LIKE ME, KIDDO.

928
01:11:00,934 --> 01:11:02,934
( clangs )

929
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:10,000
GIMME THE LIGHT.
GIMME THE LIGHT.

930
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:16,133
( gasps )
OH, MY--

931
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:27,167
OKAY, WE GOTTA GO.
GO!

932
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:30,133
GIVE ME THE LIGHT.
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE.

933
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:42,400
- Robin: THERE'S ONE
RIGHT THERE.
- WHERE?

934
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,367
( tires screech )

935
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:48,934
YOU STAY HERE!

936
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:53,601
Woman: <i>911.</i>
 <i>What's your emergency?</i>

937
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,801
YOU NEED TO SEND SOMEONE

938
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:57,801
TO CASANOVA'S PARK.

939
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:05,367
IS THIS YOUR IDEA
OF A JOKE?

940
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,501
IT'S EMPTY.

941
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:12,834
WHAT?

942
01:12:14,734 --> 01:12:17,067
IT WAS RIGHT THERE.

943
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:20,767
WE'RE NOT CRAZY.
WE CIRCLED EVERY 23rd WORD
ON EVERY 23rd PAGE

944
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:22,367
- AND IT TOLD US
TO COME DOWN HERE.
- YEAH.

945
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:25,033
AND I SOUND
COMPLETELY CRAZY,
DON'T I?

946
01:12:25,033 --> 01:12:26,767
Policeman:
 <i>JUST GET SOME SLEEP, OKAY?</i>
 <i>WE'RE DONE HERE.</i>

947
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:29,067
10-23, U.T.L.

948
01:12:32,434 --> 01:12:34,200
MOM.

949
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:38,367
OH, HONEY.

950
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:48,968
- LET'S GO HOME, OKAY?
- YEAH.

951
01:12:58,434 --> 01:13:01,033
SKELETONS CAN'T JUST
GET UP AND WALK AWAY.

952
01:13:01,033 --> 01:13:03,601
YOU WERE RIGHT.
THAT MAN WASN'T THE KILLER.

953
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:05,400
THE REAL KILLER
IS STILL OUT THERE

954
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,467
AND HE KNOWS DAD'S
ONTO HIM.

955
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,601
THE BOOK, IT'S GOT
ALL THESE-- THESE--

956
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:13,601
THESE SECRET MESSAGES
EVERY 23rd PAGE.

957
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:15,601
- HE'S RIGHT, EVERY 23rd
PAGE IN THE BOOK.
- Agatha: <i>STOP IT!</i>

958
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,868
- YES.
- BOTH OF YOU, STOP IT!
NOW LISTEN TO ME.

959
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:21,133
23 IS A NUMBER, OKAY?
THERE'S NO MAGICAL MEANING.

960
01:13:21,133 --> 01:13:22,701
ONLY PEOPLE CAN
GIVE IT THAT.

961
01:13:22,701 --> 01:13:25,434
AND I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY LUNATICS
ARE FANTASIZING ABOUT 23.

962
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,601
THEY'RE WRONG!
THERE'S NO CURSE.

963
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:30,467
THERE'S NO KILLER
RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE.

964
01:13:30,467 --> 01:13:32,300
- <i>( brakes squeal )</i>
- Walter: <i>JESUS.</i>

965
01:13:37,234 --> 01:13:39,067
IT'S HIM.

966
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,834
THAT'S NED.

967
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,834
NASTY EVIL DEAD DOG.

968
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:59,667
- DAD!
- WALTER!

969
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,334
( screeching )

970
01:14:07,534 --> 01:14:10,801
( panting )

971
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:28,467
YOU.

972
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:32,667
IT WAS YOU.

973
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:34,667
YOU MOVED THE SKELETON.

974
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:37,834
PLEASE DON'T DO

- WALTER.
- OH, GOD.

981
01:14:58,234 --> 01:14:59,767
WHOEVER WROTE IT
KNOWS YOU VERY WELL,

982

EVEN BE A MAN.

- WHY, AG?

989

FROM WHOEVER WE WERE
GONNA MEET AT THE MAILBOX
FACILITY.

997
01:15:48,434 --> 01:15:51,567
INTENDING TO KILL THAT
POOR OLD MAN WHO YOU GOT
TO PUBLISH YOUR BOOK

998
01:15:51,567 --> 01:15:53,467

YOUR LITTLE SECRET?

YOU SENT US AWAY.

- ROBIN WILL HEAR YOU.
- OH, WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT,
WOULD WE?

1001
01:16:00,634 --> 01:16:03,901
WOULDN'T WANT OUR SON
TO KNOW THE HORRIBLE TRUTH
ABOUT HIS MOTHER.

1002
01:16:03,901 --> 01:16:05,834
MOM, DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1003
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:07,801
SHE'S TOPSY KRETTS.
SHE WROTE THE BOOK.

1004
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:11,734
NO, IT'S NOT TRUE.
NOW YOUR FATHER'S GONNA
PUT DOWN THE KNIFE.

1005
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:14,434
- AREN'T YOU, WALTER?
- TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

1006
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:17,567

- TELL HIM HOW YOU TOOK
THE SKELETON.

1007

WRITE THE BOOK.

1012
01:16:28,968 --> 01:16:31,100
- NO MORE.
- DON'T DO THIS TO US, WALTER.

1013
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,767
- MOM, WHO WROTE THE BOOK?
- TELL HIM WHO WROTE IT.

1014
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:36,601
TELL HIM.

1015
01:16:36,601 --> 01:16:39,100

1016
01:16:51,267 --> 01:16:54,133

OF MENTAL INSTABILITY
OF THE PATIENT'S FAMILY.

1144
