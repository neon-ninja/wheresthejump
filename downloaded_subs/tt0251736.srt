1
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:33,471
Attention, boils and ghouls,

2
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:37,570
it's time for Dr. Wolfenstein's

3
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:40,514
"Creature Feature Show."

4
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,016
Ah-hhh.

5
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,642
The doctor is in.

6
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,280
Don't scream. Don't move.

7
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:50,382
Stay tuned for Channel 68's

8
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:53,895
Halloween Eve movie marathon.

9
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:57,663
I'm your host,
your ghost host

10
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:01,396
with the most,
Dr. Wolfenstein.

11
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,597
I will be with you

12
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:07,006
until the end.

13
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,084
Howdy folks.
Black Blood.

14
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:18,120
Violence.
Freaks of Nature.

15
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:20,155
Come on down to Captain Spaulding's

16
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:23,157
Museum of Monsters and Madmen.

17
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,125
See the Alligator Boy.

18
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,957
Ride my famous Murder Ride.

19
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:29,497
Most of all,
don't forget to take home

20
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:32,728
some of my tasty fried chicken.

21
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,230
It just tastes so damn good.

22
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:57,321
<i>... with a meat cleaver.</i>

23
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:03,359
<i>See it, hear it,</i>
<i>and actually feel it.</i>

24
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:09,662
<i>Coming after you</i>
<i>to rip your flesh apart.</i>

25
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,873
<i>Unbelievable but true.</i>

26
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,841
<i>See it, hear it,</i>
<i>and actually feel it.</i>

27
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:37,892
Shit, I can't do nothin' with this.
I can't get rid of this.

28
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,458
It ain't worth nothin',
my name's all over it.

29
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,561
I was fixing it to trade it
to Jackie Cobb.

30
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,164
That retard that hangs out
at Molly's Fruit Stand?

31
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,210
- Yeah.
- For the life of me

32
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,336
I cannot understand why
you hang out with that asshole.

33
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:52,244
He's one horny retard.

34
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:54,748
Well, ain't they all?
All they wanna do is eat and fuck.

35
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:57,877
If you knew him,
you might understand his urges.

36
00:02:57,953 --> 00:03:00,649
Worse than a rabid-ass baboon.

37
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:04,420
You know what his favorite thing is
next to whacking his weasel?

38
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,461
He takes a sharpened pencil

39
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,656
and sticks it in his eyeball
and twists it.

40
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,699
- What?
- He doesn't hurt himself though,

41
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:13,599
he kind of twists it
right next to his eyeball.

42
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,264
He'd been putting that pencil
someplace other than his eyeball.

43
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:20,797
He don't do nothin' like that.
Although, once he got caught

44
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:24,039
with a "Planet of the Apes" doll
stuck up his asshole.

45
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,478
Goddamn.

46
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,541
They had to take him
to the hospital.

47
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:32,553
Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck
halfway up his butt.

48
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,781
Couldn't get it out.

49
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,267
- Did you fix the toilet?
- Yes, I did,

50
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:51,795
and I don't want you stuffing any
goddamn paper towels down there.

51
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:54,206
I had to snake
the shit out that thing.

52
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,574
Here you go.

53
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,614
You bust that crapper
and I'm gonna bust your ass.

54
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:01,206
I hear ya.

55
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,794
Mary, fucking Moses,
ya'll get the fuck outta here.

56
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:25,568
Hold it, clowney.
Keep your paws where I can see them.

57
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,132
Don't move.
I'll blast a hole the size of

58
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,941
a Kansas City watermelon
through your ugly ass, Bozo face.

59
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:34,141
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

60
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:35,911
Go grab that other asshole
out of the shitter

61
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,476
- and drag his ass back in here.
- Right.

62
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:44,123
You miserable motherfu...
I ought to jump over this counter

63
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:46,161
and bash your fucking balls in.

64
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:48,890
All right, Tippy,
hand over the cash box

65
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,990
and I might leave
your brains inside your skull.

66
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,365
I'll tell you what, Ski King,

67
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:56,904
why don't you just take
your mama home some chicken

68
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:59,839
and then I won't have to stuff
my boot all up in ya ass!

69
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,843
I don't like chicken!

70
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:03,674
And I hate clowns!

71
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,086
Put that shit down.
Put it down!

72
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,158
That is it!

73
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:22,664
I'm gonna count to 10 and you're
gonna hand over all the cash,

74
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,858
or I'm gonna splatter
your grease-paint mug

75
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,697
across the state line.

76
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,862
- One...
- Fuck yo mama.

77
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,872
- Two...
- Fuck yo sister.

78
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,532
What are we gonna do?

79
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,405
I know you, you work
at the hardware store, right?

80
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,535
- Richard Wick, right?
- Shut your trap.

81
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:38,671
Quiet down, both of you!

82
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,647
- Three...
- Fuck yo grandma.

83
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,809
I remember now.
All the guys made fun of you.

84
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,786
- Called you Little Dick Wick.
- Shut up!

85
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:51,658
Stop singing,
I hate that song.

86
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,161
Put your fucking mask back on.

87
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,832
Fuck it!

88
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,219
Most of all,
fuck you!

89
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,619
<i>Goddamn motherfucker got</i>
<i>blood all over my best clown suit.</i>

90
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,449
How many want
to touch this afternoon?

91
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:30,542
Raise your hand if you want
God to touch you.

92
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:35,215
I'm gonna pray that God
will give you a divine touch...

93
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:38,816
...the US Department of Agriculture

94
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,055
is checking whether
state meat and poultry inspectors

95
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,065
are good enough to allow the
product to go on sale nationally.

96
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,566
The USDA has said...

97
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,727
Man, some of these
Manson chicks are really hot.

98
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:50,101
Shit, how are we
almost out of gas?

99
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:52,663
And this squeaky, right here,
now that's a girl you would date.

100
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,142
- Jerry, how much did you put in?
- I don't know? Two, three bucks.

101
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:58,338
Two, three bucks?
I told you to fill...

102
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:02,077
- Bill, feel me, am I made of money?
- Get off. Jesus Christ, Jerry.

103
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:05,348
Don't panic yourself there
way too much, caffeine guy.

104
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,446
I wouldn't be drinking
so much coffee

105
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:09,491
if you did your share
of the driving.

106
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,389
- You know I don't have nightvision.
- Oh, not this again.

107
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,553
Seriously, I can't even make out
the lines in the road.

108
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,597
If you wanna pull the car over,
I'll be more than happy

109
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,256
to kill us out
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:20,199
Besides, there's a billboard
right there.

111
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,203
Captain Spaulding's Museum
of Monsters and Madmen.

112
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,364
Awesome, great!
Fried chicken and gasoline.

113
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,874
Next exit, there you go,
problem solved

114
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,139
and we didn't have to freak out.
It was a real big deal.

115
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,442
Dick.

116
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:39,379
All right.

117
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,821
I'll pump the gas. Go inside
and see if it's worth checking out.

118
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,518
Okay, Mr. Cranky.

119
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,389
Holy... crap!

120
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,592
You gotta see this place.
It's boss.

121
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,635
- How boss?
- Really fucking boss.

122
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:55,863
Like, wake up the chicks
and break out the camera boss?

123
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:57,337
Hell, yeah.

124
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:06,446
Wakey, wakey!
Eggs and bacon.

125
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,483
Hey, sweetie, come on.

126
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,518
Grab Mary and get your stuff
and come on inside.

127
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:13,453
Bill and I found a kick-ass place.
Come on, move, move!

128
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,985
Let's go.

129
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:23,429
Come on, Sleeping Beauty,
it's time to go to work.

130
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,635
What's in that case over there?

131
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:40,147
Hairless monkey.

132
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:43,116
Did you see the crocodile boy?

133
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,551
How'd you like to find
that in your pants?

134
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,116
- Excuse me, sir? Howdy.
- Hi.

135
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:54,185
I love this place. How long have
you been running this place?

136
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:57,460
Well, uhm...
How long's a piece of string?

137
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:00,195
I don't know.

138
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,204
Too goddamn long,
that's how long.

139
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:05,968
Too goddamn long,
that's right.

140
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,703
Right, I hear that,
but how long, actually?

141
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:12,008
Oh, shit, I don't know exactly.

142
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,039
I took over for my pa,
right after the Duke damned Oscar.

143
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,382
- Oh, you mean John Wayne.
- Hell, son.

144
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:20,546
How many dukes do you know about?

145
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:23,182
- Greatest American ever lived.
- Look at that.

146
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:25,852
"Circle up the wagons, pilgrims."

147
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,862
"Whatever you say, cowboy."

148
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:31,894
I'm not that much of a Western fan.

149
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,662
I like science-fiction.

150
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,669
Ah-hhh. Space boy.

151
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,935
I figured as much.

152
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,976
Let me ask you something.

153
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:45,377
How come you're asking
so many jackassy questions?

154
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,415
My friends and I,
we're driving across country

155
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:50,918
writing this book on off-beat
roadside attractions,

156
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,853
the crazy shit you see when
you're driving across the country.

157
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,982
I don't drive cross country.

158
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:59,027
But if you did.

159
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,391
But I don't.

160
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:04,592
Yeah, but supposing
for a second that you did.

161
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:09,598
You little dickens, you.

162
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,798
I know what your problem is.

163
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,534
What's that?

164
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,635
Ya'll think us folks from the
country's funny-like, don't you?

165
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:18,805
- Jerry...
- Well, saddle up the mule, ma.

166
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,247
Slide me some grits,
I's got to get me some education.

167
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:24,717
- Jerry...
- You asshole.

168
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,380
No, I'm really very interested,
I'm not trying to make fun.

169
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:32,289
Gotcha!

170
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,421
You are such a bad clown.

171
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:37,260
Oh, fuck me, Side Sally,

172
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:40,495
who the hell'd wanna read about
all this horseshit anyway?

173
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:41,968
You'd be surprised.

174
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:44,562
Son, look around.

175
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,733
Would I be surprised?

176
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,881
Finally. Great, great. Come on, we
paid for the tickets.

177
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,974
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- What tickets?

178
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:59,145
This isn't everything.
There is actually a murder ride.

179
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:02,088
A murder ride?
I don't want to go on a murder ride.

180
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,954
- Yes, you do wanna go on a...
- No, I don't.

181
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,756
Hey, how about
if we skip the murder ride?

182
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,591
Hey, how about if we go?

183
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,861
Anytime this year, people.
Tour is about to begin.

184
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,231
Okay, we'll see you inside
the murder ride, we'll be back. Bye.

185
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,033
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

186
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,663
children of all ages,

187
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,938
you are about to enter
the world of darkness,

188
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,276
a world where life
and death are meaningless,

189
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,374
and pain is God.

190
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:32,045
- Pain!
- Billy, let's go.

191
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,181
- Quit that, sport.
- Sorry, Captain Spaulding.

192
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,327
We gonna have a good time now.

193
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:43,557
On your right, you will see

194
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:48,467
the infamous
Albert... Fish.

195
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,002
Masochist, sadist,

196
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:56,044
child killer and most importantly,

197
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,635
cannibal.

198
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:01,547
Mr. Fish, born 1870
and enjoyed spankings

199
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:03,675
with nail-studded paddles,

200
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:06,915
stuffing needles
deep into his groin.

201
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:10,754
- I have a question. How many...
- Hold all questions.

202
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,391
No, no, help.

203
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:24,066
Lizzie fucking Borden.

204
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,199
Now, one of our most famous crazies,

205
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:31,041
the psycho of Plainsfield,
Mr. Ed Gein.

206
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,876
Murderer, cannibal,

207
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:35,143
Mr. Gein used to take
great pleasure

208
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:39,517
of playing with
dead bodies of women,

209
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:43,422
especially, their sexual organs.

210
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:04,375
Now, one of our local heroes,

211
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,073
S. Quentin Quale,

212
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:09,311
aka Dr. Satan.

213
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:11,318
Oh shit!

214
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,551
Murderer, torturer,
but most of all, master surgeon.

215
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,593
Mr. Quail was an intern

216
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,720
at Willows County Mental Hospital,

217
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,765
nicknamed Weeping Willows

218
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,801
for the neverending cries of pain.

219
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:29,166
Through primitive brain surgery...

220
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:31,205
- Jerry, stop it.
- Mr. Quail believed

221
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:34,208
that he could create
a race of superhumans

222
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:35,834
from the mentally ill.

223
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:38,277
Vigilante justice prevailed.

224
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:40,211
They took his ass out and hung him.

225
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,247
And that infamous hanging tree

226
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,412
is no more than a stone's throw away

227
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,820
from where y'alls' ass
is now seated.

228
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,920
But the next day

229
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,122
his body was found
to be missing.

230
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:58,166
Until today

231
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,895
no trace of Dr. Satan

232
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:02,937
has ever been discovered.

233
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,732
But then, who knows?

234
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:12,778
Maybe he lives next door to you.

235
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,143
Tour's over.
Exit through the doors.

236
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,884
That was so bad-ass.

237
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,224
Dr. Satan. Ah-hhh,
Dr. Satan.

238
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:31,498
Maybe he lives next door to you.

239
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:34,091
Calm down, it was all right.

240
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:37,036
Do you think maybe we could go now?

241
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:39,471
I'm gonna go call my dad.
I'll be right back.

242
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,567
I love you.

243
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:44,077
What do you mean,
it was all right?

244
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:46,409
It was cool,
but it wasn't that great.

245
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:49,314
Dude, you don't have to play it
down in front of your chick.

246
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,375
- Oh.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,893
Don't move a muscle, an artery,

248
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:08,629
Or a vein.

249
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,705
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

250
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:13,240
- Wow, Denise.
- We stopped for gas

251
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:16,175
at this place
called Captain Spaulding's,

252
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,213
somewhere outside
of Ruggsville.

253
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:23,217
It turned into this whole big thing,
so we're behind schedule.

254
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,582
Don't be too late.

255
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:28,419
I forgot to tell you that Halloween
falls on a school night

256
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,357
so they're
trick-or-treating tonight.

257
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,888
Your left hand shows your past;

258
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:38,330
your right hand shows your future.

259
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:44,772
Good evening.
I'm Lance Brockwell

260
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,331
and this is the 7:00 news.
And our top story tonight,

261
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,174
investigators still have no leads
to the strange disappearance

262
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:54,010
of the five cheerleaders
from Ruggsville High School.

263
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,073
Cindy Thompson, Karen Murphy,

264
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:59,348
Allison Cole, Valarie Green,
and Dawn Baker

265
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:02,219
were last seen four days ago
leaving a football game.

266
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,390
I know it seems stupid,
but I really wanna see this tree.

267
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,826
Do yourself a favor, son,
just forget about it.

268
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:10,524
Oh, come on,
I live for this shit.

269
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,227
Okay, all right,
I'll draw you a damn map.

270
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,293
- Thank you.
- I still say it's a waste of time.

271
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:19,534
You are here.
Go straight up this road.

272
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,803
Make the first right.
First left.

273
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,901
Come straight across
and down.

274
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,947
Can't find it? Tough.

275
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,811
- Here's your map.
- Right on.

276
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,850
- Here's your complimentary chicken.
- Oh, wow.

277
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,182
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

278
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,278
You're gonna get
a great write-up for this.

279
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:50,037
Here's an idea, let's just skip it.
It's probably nothing anyway.

280
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:53,438
Christ, Jerry, Bill is right,
we can't see anything.

281
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,668
What's that?

282
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:58,368
Hitchhiker.

283
00:18:58,446 --> 00:19:01,438
- What? Should we stop?
- We can't leave her in the rain.

284
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,110
Stick her in the front
if you wanna pick her up so bad.

285
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,852
So, uh,

286
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,722
- where ya headed?
- I was just going home.

287
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:15,388
- Home, where's that?
- A couple miles up the road.

288
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:18,023
- So, you live around here?
- Yeah.

289
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,192
Do you know where
this Dr. Satan tree's at?

290
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:22,793
Yeah. You know where that's at?
It's right by my house.

291
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,702
- I can show you.
- Really?

292
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:27,469
- So, it is a real thing.
- Fuck you.

293
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,807
So, a tree?
Where's it at?

294
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,370
- What tree?
Okay, this is crazy.

295
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:35,416
She obviously doesn't
know anything.

296
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:37,644
Oh, I know,
I'll show you where it's at.

297
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,621
Whatever you need to do, you do it.

298
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,588
There is no wrong.

299
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,753
If someone needs to be killed,
you kill 'em.

300
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:49,388
That's the way.

301
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,613
Fuck.

302
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,945
I think we blew a tire.

303
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:15,454
- Oh poop.
- Oh, hell.

304
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:19,152
At least we got that spare.

305
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:21,092
You filled it up
like I asked, right?

306
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:22,652
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,866
Okay, what if I forgot
to put it back in the trunk?

308
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,960
What would plan B entail?

309
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:32,734
- Jesus Christ, Jerry.
- Technically I did what you said.

310
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,275
Oh for fucking sake, Jerry,
what're we gonna do now?

311
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:38,073
I can't rightly
say if I know, me ladies.

312
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:39,977
Wait, I love this song.

313
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:45,715
Would you turn
the radio off, please?!

314
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,618
God!

315
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,589
We can walk to my house from here.

316
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:50,385
What?

317
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,427
My brother's got a tow truck.
He can come get your car.

318
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:55,725
- I'll go, it's my fault.
- Forget it, I'm going.

319
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,822
- No, Bill, I...
- You guys stay here.

320
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,662
There's no sense in everyone
getting drenched.

321
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,271
Returning to the news,
local authorities still have no lead

322
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,308
in the mysterious disappearance
of the five cheerleaders

323
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,172
from Ruggsville.
The girls were last seen

324
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:11,974
leaving a cheering competition...

325
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,343
It was loud enough
to wake the dead.

326
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:14,847
That's an idea.
What is?

327
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,852
Wouldn't it be dramatic? Supposing
the people inside were dead,

328
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,447
all stretched out with the lights
quietly burning about them.

329
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:24,617
I'm sure it would be very amusing.

330
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,526
Why you ask?
Why is not the question.

331
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,393
How?

332
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:33,696
Now, that is a question
worth examining.

333
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:36,236
How could I,

334
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:38,795
being born of such

335
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:40,966
conventional stock,

336
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:43,135
arrive a leader of the rebellion?

337
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:47,341
An escapist from a conformist world,
destined to find happiness

338
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:50,316
only in that which
cannot be explained.

339
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:52,751
I brought you here for a reason.

340
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:56,348
But unfortunately,
you and your sentimental minds

341
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:58,016
are doing me no good.

342
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:01,061
My brain is frozen,

343
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:02,756
locked.

344
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,822
I have to break free

345
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,892
from this culture
of mechanical reproductions

346
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,404
and the thick incrustations

347
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:13,201
dying on the surface.

348
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,242
Oh, Christ.

349
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:18,206
Fuck it.

350
00:22:35,263 --> 00:22:37,060
These are all my dolls.

351
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:39,099
I used to chop their heads off
and their arms

352
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,101
and stick them up on the wall.

353
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:46,062
The door's locked,
I gotta go around.

354
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,938
Just wait here.

355
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,154
Jesus Christ!
Don't do that.

356
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,427
You scared the shit out of me.

357
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,230
You ain't seen nothing yet.

358
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:18,170
- Is your brother ready to go?
- Yeah, he already left.

359
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:20,605
- Come on, inside.
- What? He left?

360
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,267
Come on and get toasty.

361
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:29,209
Don't worry about it, he's fine.

362
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,582
I just don't understand why...

363
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:35,814
What was that?

364
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:40,358
What? I didn't hear anything.

365
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,396
Turn the radio off.

366
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,260
Now listen.

367
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:51,471
I still don't hear anything.

368
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,474
I swear to God,
I heard some weird...

369
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:57,568
Turn on the headlights,
see if something's out there.

370
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,849
Calm down, calm down.

371
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,755
Jesus H. Christ.

372
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,193
It's the fucking tow truck guy.

373
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:29,610
So,

374
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,042
you live alone here?

375
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:34,309
I mean,
just you and your brother?

376
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:36,976
Nah, there's a bunch of us
around somewhere.

377
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:39,952
I think Otis is upstairs
messing around or something.

378
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,498
You gotta have the marshmallows.

379
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:54,194
That's what makes it fun.

380
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:56,463
Yeah, I guess.

381
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,097
You sure do a lot of guessing.

382
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:00,640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

383
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,537
Wow.

384
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:09,583
Look at him.

385
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,551
He must've been going pretty fast
to smash through that wall.

386
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,123
You sure are silly
for a guy with glasses.

387
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,353
- I like that.
- Okay, hey.

388
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:23,659
Need those to see, thank you.

389
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,756
How do I look?

390
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,801
Terrific, really.

391
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,806
Tasty.

392
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,867
Ain't the only thing
tasty in this house.

393
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:54,290
Okay, okay.

394
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:56,330
I wonder what time...

395
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:58,627
- it's getting kind of late.
- Don't worry, sugar.

396
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:01,224
It ain't past my bedtime

397
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:03,395
Are you flirting with me?

398
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:05,029
What? Oh, no.

399
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:11,706
Great! They're back.

400
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,679
Whoppie-fucking-do.

401
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,717
Excuse me?

402
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:24,850
I gotta call my dad
and tell him we're gonna be late.

403
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:27,861
Can I use your phone, please?

404
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:28,861
Hello?

405
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,955
Ain't got one.

406
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:35,800
- Oh, hi.
- Goodness.

407
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,795
You really don't have a phone?

408
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,804
No.

409
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:48,080
I once had one back in '57,

410
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,980
but...

411
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:55,516
I don't quite remember.
There's nobody round here.

412
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,118
I feel like jaw-flapping at no more.

413
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:03,391
Do you think the guy with the tow
truck could drive us to a phone?

414
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:06,695
His name is Rufus,
Rufus Jr.

415
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,930
But we all call him

416
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:13,997
- RJ.
- Makes sense.

417
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:17,203
What do they call you, sweetie?

418
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:19,769
I am Qualsnarg of the Crab Nebula.

419
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:25,778
But you humans can call me Jerry.

420
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,445
Jerry.

421
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,150
Baby, go on and see how RJ's doin'
with these nice folks' automobile.

422
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:39,725
Why don't you just all make
yourselves to home?

423
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,194
What brings you kids way out here?

424
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:47,002
Haven't you got something better
to do on Halloween

425
00:27:47,074 --> 00:27:49,008
than wander around
out in the sticks?

426
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:51,101
I thought maybe
we'd take in a hoedown.

427
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:56,448
No, he's just joking.

428
00:27:57,752 --> 00:28:01,210
- You are?
- I'm sorry, I'm messing with you.

429
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:04,349
Shut up, dude.

430
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,290
Oh, I get it.

431
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:09,922
Y'all just think you're too good

432
00:28:09,997 --> 00:28:12,090
for the simple pleasures
of Halloween.

433
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:16,227
No, just a little too old.

434
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:19,740
Oh really? I hope something
changes your mind

435
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,707
someday.

436
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:26,612
- Mama, Tiny's home.
- What about RJ?

437
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,410
He was gone before I seen him.

438
00:28:28,482 --> 00:28:31,849
But Tiny saw him and said he said
he was going down to the yard

439
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,080
to get a new wheel.

440
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:36,453
How long is that gonna take?

441
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:39,254
Probably be back
in a couple of hours.

442
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:42,023
A couple of hours? What?

443
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,155
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?

444
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:50,937
Tiny ain't got no car,

445
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:53,166
he ain't even got a bicycle.

446
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,870
Even though I know
that you think it is childish,

447
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:02,677
tonight is Halloween Eve,

448
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,274
and to us

449
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:07,219
it is special.

450
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:11,725
So you are all invited to dinner.

451
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,426
I hope to Christ she don't expect
us to wear these things.

452
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:22,162
What ever it is, just do it.

453
00:29:22,236 --> 00:29:24,796
The more we play along the faster
we'll get the hell out of here.

454
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:27,898
Now is not the time to make waves.
Jerry.

455
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,428
You'll have to forgive Tiny.

456
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:32,665
He can't hear so much.

457
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:37,042
That poor baby.

458
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:40,080
It's his daddy's fault.

459
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:42,911
Earl wasn't a bad man,

460
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:44,780
he never hit me
or nothing like that.

461
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:48,049
One day he just up
and went devil on us all.

462
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:52,320
- What happened?
- He tried to burn down the house.

463
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,487
He said it was
possessed by the spirits.

464
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:59,624
And Tiny was sleeping in the
basement where the fire started.

465
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:05,768
But I don't think Earl
ever meant to harm us.

466
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:10,042
Tiny was badly burnt,
his ears were destroyed

467
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:12,579
and most of his skin.

468
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:16,309
- Is that why he wears the mask?
- Yeah.

469
00:31:16,384 --> 00:31:19,080
My baby boy gets
shy around new people,

470
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,021
but he'll warm up to you,

471
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,251
especially the girls.

472
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:30,687
He's a real lady-killer.

473
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,307
You're gonna miss
a good show tonight.

474
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:46,369
That's your tough luck.

475
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:49,245
I thought you kids
were all about team spirit.

476
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:52,945
You ain't done fuck-all
to cheer me up since you got here.

477
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,113
Give me a B. Give me an A.

478
00:31:55,189 --> 00:31:57,657
Give me a B. Give me a Y.

479
00:31:57,725 --> 00:32:01,252
What's that spell?
What's that spell?!

480
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:04,195
What's that spell?!

481
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:05,926
Baby.

482
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,161
You're damn right.

483
00:32:26,854 --> 00:32:29,482
Okay now.
Everybody put on your masks.

484
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:34,119
Can't very well eat our desserts
with our everyday faces exposed.

485
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:35,753
Can we?

486
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:39,266
Gosh, kid, put it on.

487
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,659
She ain't gonna let
any of us touch dessert

488
00:32:43,737 --> 00:32:46,706
unless you're wearing
this damn thing.

489
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,112
Mrs. Firefly?

490
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,149
Do you know anything
about the legend of Dr. Satan?

491
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:58,208
Here we go.
- Shut up.

492
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:05,521
I'm not much for gossip
and this and that,

493
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:07,561
- but I have heard...
- I know all about

494
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,789
what you wanna know all about.

495
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,559
Otis.

496
00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:13,725
I can't believe you decided

497
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:16,292
to come down and join us.

498
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:26,537
And you brought Little Wolf.

499
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:28,582
Oh, my baby.

500
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,512
Oh my God.

501
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:36,479
It's such a special night for me.

502
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,089
I don't know

503
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:45,563
who told you your fairy fables
about Dr. Satan.

504
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,931
We heard it from a Captain Spaulding

505
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:48,991
up the road at...

506
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,196
That old bitch hog don't know shit.

507
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:54,708
Tells this cute little tattle-tales
to sell his junk,

508
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:57,767
but he don't sell
no Yankee boys no truth.

509
00:33:57,845 --> 00:34:00,405
Something happened, right? It had
to be based on some real incident.

510
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:04,247
Are you, Jimmy Olsen,
cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?

511
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:08,084
- Grampa, watch your language.
- I don't think you need to know.

512
00:34:09,023 --> 00:34:10,547
Better you leave here
with your head still full

513
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:13,286
of kitty cats and puppy dogs.

514
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,229
- I really would like to know...
- Hey, he'd really like to know.

515
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,130
Enlighten him.

516
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,364
I bet you'd stick your head in fire
if I told ya you could see hell.

517
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,531
Meanwhile, you're too stupid
to realize

518
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,632
you got a demon
sticking out your ass

519
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:31,701
singing, "Holy Miss Moley,"

520
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,680
"Got me a live one."

521
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,778
Can we change the subject, please?

522
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:42,215
Dinner's over.

523
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:46,626
Ladies and germs,

524
00:34:46,694 --> 00:34:48,787
it's show time!

525
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:01,905
Tell you a little story...

526
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,274
Eat your wife's pussy...

527
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:07,746
I mean jam your face in it!

528
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,645
...starts licking and chomping
on her pussy

529
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,914
and she's screamin'
and yellin' and she just...

530
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,580
Ah-hhh!

531
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,148
The old battleaxe at home's
liable to crush my balls!

532
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:23,593
Would you be quiet?

533
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:26,531
You're gonna wake up grandma.

534
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:32,801
Bravo, man.

535
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,501
Hey, hey, hey, don't be moving now,
don't be moving.

536
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:38,977
We got something real special
for you men out there.

537
00:35:56,563 --> 00:36:00,021
Wow!

538
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,446
Jerry.

539
00:36:56,924 --> 00:37:00,655
Get off him.

540
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:05,062
I said get the fuck off him,
you stupid fucking whore!

541
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:07,600
- Fucking slut!
- You shouldn't have done that.

542
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:09,636
Oh, really? Are you gonna
do something about it?

543
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:11,466
- I'll do something, motherfucker.
- Yeah, come on.

544
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:14,029
I'll fucking cut your tits off
and shove them down your throat.

545
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:16,042
- Baby, stop!
- Come on, Ma,

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,305
- this bitch has got it coming.
- No, I told you, remember?

547
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,408
- Car's done.
- Thank God.

548
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:25,645
I suggest that you kids leave.

549
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,744
We're gone.

550
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:31,582
Fuck you!

551
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:36,424
- I love you, Mama.
- I know.

552
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,604
Lock the fucking doors!
Hurry up.

553
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:46,639
Jesus Christ, you think she
was really gonna cut you.

554
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:49,471
Of course she was gonna cut me,
she's a fucking nut.

555
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:54,745
I knew she was crazy from
the second we picked her up.

556
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,840
Okay. That's that.

557
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,818
Let's get out
of this fucking nuthouse.

558
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:14,060
What're you doing?
Why are you stopping?

559
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:16,432
- I gotta open the gate!
- For Christ's sake, hurry up!

560
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:27,605
Oh, shit!

561
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,592
Somebody help him!

562
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,365
Oh shit!
What are they doing to him?

563
00:38:58,745 --> 00:39:01,179
Who's that?

564
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:03,113
Oh my God!

565
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:11,324
Shut the fucking door!
Oh, no!

566
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:35,010
Somebody help us!

567
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,551
Oh my God! Get away from us!

568
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:44,554
No, please.

569
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,092
Oh my God!

570
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,592
No-ooo!

572
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:55,668
Help me! Help me!

- Don Willis, how the hell are you?
<i>- Listen, Frank,</i>

582
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,228
I'm a little worried about Denise.

583
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:01,927
She called me last night
from the road near Ruggsville,

584
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,800
a place called Spaulding's.

585
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,839
<i>Yeah, I know the joint.</i>

586
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:10,138
She said she'd be here about 11:00,
but she never showed up.

587
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,179
I'll run a check on up there
by Spaulding's

588
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:16,215
and see if there's any accidents,
or road closings.

589
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:19,343
It was raining like
a son of a bitch here last night.

590
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:21,546
They're probably just stuck
in the mud someplace.

591
00:41:42,943 --> 00:41:45,571
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

592
00:41:45,645 --> 00:41:49,012
I said, shut your fucking mouth!

593
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:56,422
Listen, you Malibu middleclass
Barbie piece of shit,

594
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,082
I'm trying to work here!

595
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:00,888
Work! You ever work?

596
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:02,724
Yeah, I'll bet you have.

597
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:05,822
Scooping ice cream to your shitheel
friends on summer break.

598
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,027
I ain't talking about
no goddamn white socks

599
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:12,196
with Mickey Mouse on one side
and Donald Duck on the other.

600
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,740
I ain't readin'
no funny books, Mama.

601
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:18,744
Our bodies come and go,
but this blood is forever.

602
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,280
I'm gonna remove your gag,

603
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,150
but if you make so much
as a fucking peep

604
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,653
I'm gonna cut you like a pig

605
00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:31,850
and make you eat your own
fucking intestines. You got me?

606
00:42:43,036 --> 00:42:46,233
Why are you doing this to me?

607
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:49,867
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

608
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,376
Messy up your day?

609
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,970
Where's Bill?

610
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:56,709
- Where's Bill?
- Bill?

611
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,081
Is he okay?

612
00:42:59,152 --> 00:43:00,483
He's a good guy.

613
00:43:00,554 --> 00:43:05,150
He's been a great help to me.
A real blessin'.

614
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:08,956
I couldn't have asked
for a better specimen.

615
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:11,687
You don't know

616
00:43:11,765 --> 00:43:14,131
what kind of dry spell I've had,

617
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:16,761
total block, total block.

618
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:20,903
But Bill,

619
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,771
he's okay.

620
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:26,211
Where is he?

621
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,270
Hi.

622
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,571
Where is he?
Can I see him?

623
00:44:31,645 --> 00:44:34,011
Can I see Bill, please?

624
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,173
Let's go see.

625
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:42,019
Behold...

626
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:44,522
- Fish-boy!
- Oh my God!

627
00:44:44,591 --> 00:44:46,889
Oh my God, Bill.

628
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,224
No, no, this can't be real.
This can't be real.

629
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:52,060
This can't be real,
this can't be real.

630
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:54,066
Oh, it's real.

631
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:56,500
Real as I want it to be, Mama.

632
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,942
Fuck you, you fucking freak!

633
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:32,298
Well...

634
00:45:32,372 --> 00:45:34,772
Let's see if the nut that runs
this place can help us.

635
00:45:37,377 --> 00:45:39,971
Take a look at all this crap.

636
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:43,504
I'd red flag anybody
running a joint like this.

637
00:45:44,718 --> 00:45:47,084
Sweet baby Jesus.

638
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:49,951
Whoever's jerking off on that bell
better be gone when I come out,

639
00:45:50,023 --> 00:45:52,719
or I'm gonna rip your nuts off.

640
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:57,897
Officers, officers,
what can I do for you?

641
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,226
I ain't fired up the birds yet

642
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,290
if that's what you've been
ring-a-ding-dinging about.

643
00:46:01,368 --> 00:46:04,804
I need you to answer some questions
about some missing kids.

644
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:06,429
Oh, I don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

645
00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:09,134
I'm the kind of guy that
just minds his own business,

646
00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:10,767
if you get what I'm saying.

647
00:46:10,844 --> 00:46:14,109
You seen this girl?
Say in the last 24 hours?

648
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:18,250
Yeah, yeah, a cute kid.

649
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,286
Ain't my type though.

650
00:46:20,353 --> 00:46:22,844
I like 'em with a little
more meat on 'em.

651
00:46:22,922 --> 00:46:26,153
The bigger the cushion,
the sweeter the pushin'.

652
00:46:29,562 --> 00:46:31,530
Look, clown-ass,
just answer the damn question.

653
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:33,259
We ain't interested
in your love life, all right?

654
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,767
Cut the crap, Spaulding
and get with the facts.

655
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:36,927
Huh?

656
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:40,131
What did you see?
Who was she with?

657
00:46:40,206 --> 00:46:42,174
- Where was she going?
- I don't know.

658
00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:44,904
She was with some stupid kids.
They's nosing around,

659
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:47,003
asking a bunch
of stupid questions.

660
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,048
- Questions about what?
- I don't know.

661
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:53,711
This and that. Mostly a bunch
of tired Dr. Satan bullshit.

662
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:56,745
They caught a gander
at the display in the back

663
00:46:56,823 --> 00:46:58,290
and they figured
they's gonna run out

664
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:00,622
and solve
the great Deadwood mystery.

665
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,457
And how'd they get that idea?

666
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,724
I wrote 'em a map.

667
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:06,993
Out to the old farm road.

668
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:09,035
I figured, what the hell?
It wouldn't do no harm.

669
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:11,866
'Sides, it's good
for my tourist trade.

670
00:47:13,406 --> 00:47:15,567
You can shit 10 bricks
for all I care.

671
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:18,704
What else?

672
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,446
Nothin'.

673
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:23,914
Stupid-ass kids probably
got themselves

674
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:27,180
turned around ass-backwards
and got theyself lost.

675
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:31,656
Is that all? And I want you
to think real hard.

676
00:47:36,363 --> 00:47:38,763
Well,
I don't rightly know.

677
00:47:38,832 --> 00:47:40,800
They wasn't here
long enough for me

678
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:42,858
to get up close
and personal with 'em,

679
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:46,235
like I do most assholes
that come wandering in here.

680
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:49,400
How about you write them same
directions out for me then?

681
00:47:49,476 --> 00:47:52,775
All right, all right. Don't get all
"True Grit" on my ass.

682
00:47:52,846 --> 00:47:55,474
You can knock yourself
silly for all I care.

683
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:58,016
Enough talk!
Write.

684
00:48:01,554 --> 00:48:04,045
I don't know where
that skunk ape sleeps.

685
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:08,254
All I know is, that he had
impure relations with my wife.

686
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:13,899
That's true, he performed lurid
acts upon me and my person.

687
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:15,901
Hold up the picture.

688
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:17,800
I'm gonna kill that skunk ape.

689
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,616
Please, Tiny.
Please let me go.

690
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:15,054
Let me go.
Help me.

691
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:18,921
Please, God, please.

692
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,352
Thank you.
Thank you.

693
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,226
I'm just gonna go now.

694
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:34,467
I'm just gonna go home.

695
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,975
I'm just gonna go home now.

696
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,508
I'm just gonna go home now.

697
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,708
I'm just gonna go now.

698
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:51,318
I'm just going home now.

699
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:54,053
Where the fuck do you think
you're getting to?

700
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:56,095
No, no, no...

701
00:51:01,834 --> 00:51:04,064
Playtime is over.

702
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,591
It matches.

703
00:51:29,662 --> 00:51:31,721
Call it in.

704
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,096
- I think we found 'em.
- Yeah.

705
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,044
Hey, poopie pants.
What's new?

706
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:52,882
Where the fuck is Bill? Where's
Denise? You can't keep us here.

707
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:55,648
Shut up!

708
00:51:55,722 --> 00:51:58,122
Wanna play a guessing game?

709
00:51:59,926 --> 00:52:02,827
Guess what number I'm thinking of.

710
00:52:02,895 --> 00:52:04,988
Eat shit and die.

711
00:52:08,935 --> 00:52:11,403
No, wait, please. Come on, stop it.
What do you want from me?

712
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:13,871
- What do you want from...
- Be quiet. I don't wanna slip.

713
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:20,770
Okay, one more.

714
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,680
You get this right,
I'll let you go.

715
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,176
If you get it wrong,
you are fucked!

716
00:52:27,253 --> 00:52:30,279
Who's my favorite movie star?

717
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:32,688
I don't know.

718
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:34,886
Marilyn Monroe.

719
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:39,553
No, Betty Davis.
Sorry, you lose!

720
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,224
Ah-hhh!

721
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:48,165
Jesus, somebody
had themselves a field day

722
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:50,209
beating the shit out this thing,
didn't they?

723
00:52:50,276 --> 00:52:52,540
Yeah.

724
00:52:52,612 --> 00:52:55,206
No mercy shown here.

725
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:57,841
Didn't find any bodies, did ya?

726
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:02,013
- Not yet.
- Holy Christ.

727
00:53:02,088 --> 00:53:05,353
What could these kids have done
to bring this much hell down on 'em?

728
00:53:05,425 --> 00:53:07,723
- I found something.
- What's that?

729
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:08,761
Keys.

730
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:11,729
Don't stand there like some
prize dog, Dick, open the trunk.

731
00:53:11,798 --> 00:53:14,062
- Yes, sir.
- Toss them here.

732
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:21,834
- Oh, Goddamn.
You got something, Georgie?

733
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,239
Yeah.

734
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:24,873
We found something.

735
00:53:24,944 --> 00:53:27,174
People come, people go,

736
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,941
but how many ever stop
to take a look

737
00:53:29,015 --> 00:53:32,246
at the underbelly of the beast?

738
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:35,412
I make 'em stop
and I make 'em look.

739
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:38,082
Hope you like what you see.

740
00:53:38,157 --> 00:53:40,455
Hope you like what you see!

741
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:44,519
Just hold it a minute, Grandpa.

742
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:47,293
<i>At a time</i>
<i>like this, you're taking pictures?</i>

743
00:53:47,366 --> 00:53:49,334
<i>I just couldn't help it.</i>

744
00:53:49,402 --> 00:53:51,893
<i>You look so natural</i>
<i>sitting in that box.</i>

745
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:56,567
Put me behind the wheel of that
bitch, I'll show you drivin'.

746
00:53:56,642 --> 00:54:01,477
You useless fuck. You couldn't
even get your big ass in that seat.

747
00:54:01,547 --> 00:54:03,674
You ungrateful...

748
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,583
Don't start with me, Hugo.

749
00:54:12,024 --> 00:54:14,720
Get off the damn car,
this ain't your living room.

750
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:17,126
Goddamn grease monkey.

751
00:54:19,832 --> 00:54:22,528
You sure this guy is supposed
to ride with us... in this car?

752
00:54:22,602 --> 00:54:24,092
Mm-hmm.

753
00:54:26,572 --> 00:54:28,540
This doesn't seem right to me.

754
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:32,339
It ain't up to us, Chief said pick
him up and take him with us.

755
00:54:32,411 --> 00:54:34,777
Guy's an ex-cop,
figures he can be of some help.

756
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:37,782
I just hope he doesn't
get in my way, is all I'm sayin'.

757
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:46,854
This must be him.

758
00:54:49,428 --> 00:54:51,760
- Mr. Willis?
- Yes, sir.

759
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:54,425
- I'm Wydell, this is Nash.
- How you doin', sir?

760
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,492
Donald Willis.
Any leads?

761
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,765
We were on our way out
to check on a couple of farms

762
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,238
out on the edge of town.

763
00:55:01,307 --> 00:55:03,172
That's about our only lead
up to this point.

764
00:55:03,242 --> 00:55:05,335
What about this body you found?

765
00:55:05,411 --> 00:55:07,436
You know about that?

766
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:09,640
Local girl.
Karen Murphy.

767
00:55:09,715 --> 00:55:12,616
One of the cheerleaders
that went missing last week.

768
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:13,652
That's it?

769
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,687
We know the kids
were on their way out

770
00:55:15,755 --> 00:55:17,450
to a place the locals
call Deadwood.

771
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,321
They wanted to play Nancy Drew
with this local legend

772
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:21,985
people call Dr. Satan.

773
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:24,393
- This is insane.
- Don't you worry about it.

774
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:26,021
We'll find her, all right?

775
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:32,597
My name is Lewis Dover

776
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:36,335
and I'm no rich man,
but I know the truth.

777
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:38,377
You don't have to go to hell.

778
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:41,004
You're in hell... this is hell.

779
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,548
This is hell.
This is hell.

780
00:56:21,787 --> 00:56:25,245
I'm gonna see if anybody's home.
You and Mr. Willis

781
00:56:25,324 --> 00:56:27,815
check around,
see if you see anything.

782
00:56:27,894 --> 00:56:29,156
Come with me.

783
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:40,405
I hate fucked up families!

784
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:42,771
- It's just a dip.
Otis!

785
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:45,743
Otis, come quick.
There's cops out there.

786
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:47,802
- What? Damn!
- How many?

787
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,940
- Don't worry about it.
- I don't know. I only saw one.

788
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:53,781
Fucking pigs always travel in packs.

789
00:56:53,853 --> 00:56:55,821
- Take this.
- What should I do?

790
00:56:55,888 --> 00:56:58,288
Go downstairs and play nice.

791
00:56:59,525 --> 00:57:04,189
I'll go round back and take control
like I always fucking do.

792
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,497
Goddamn.

793
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:11,331
These packrats throw anything away?

794
00:57:11,404 --> 00:57:14,737
- I don't think so.
- Hold this thing.

795
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:18,766
Hello? Hello?

796
00:57:23,716 --> 00:57:26,014
You'd think these son of bitches
would have a yard sale, don't you?

797
00:57:26,085 --> 00:57:27,484
Yeah.

798
00:57:29,422 --> 00:57:31,754
Hello?

799
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:34,156
Oh my God!

800
00:57:34,226 --> 00:57:37,059
- Oh my God!
- Calm down, Barney!

801
00:57:37,129 --> 00:57:39,097
Don't even start
with that "Mayberry" shit.

802
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,132
It's only a dog.

803
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:42,099
I was bit by a cocker spaniel
when I was eight years old.

804
00:57:44,136 --> 00:57:46,604
- Hello, Officer.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

805
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,970
I'm Lieutenant Wydell. I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

806
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:53,171
Why, heck, I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

807
00:57:53,245 --> 00:57:55,213
I appreciate the cooperation, ma'am.

808
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:56,680
I'm looking for a missing girl.

809
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:59,946
I'm serious. It was a big
cocker spaniel... big teeth.

810
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,647
It was my ex-girlfriend's.
Almost bit off my pinky toe.

811
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:04,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

812
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:06,725
Shh, you hear that?

813
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:07,759
Yeah.

814
00:58:07,827 --> 00:58:09,954
Yeah, I hear it. Where do
you think it's coming from?

815
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,497
Out this way.

816
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:15,261
All right, hold on,
hold on one second here.

817
00:58:15,334 --> 00:58:16,926
Hey, hey!

818
00:58:17,003 --> 00:58:18,994
Sheriff's Department, open up.

819
00:58:19,071 --> 00:58:22,268
- No, I ain't seen her, sorry.
- Ma'am...

820
00:58:22,341 --> 00:58:24,104
If I could just
come in for a minute.

821
00:58:24,176 --> 00:58:26,838
I have some other pictures
I'd like you to look at.

822
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:29,210
It might stir something up.

823
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:31,272
No. I don't think so.

824
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,977
Ma'am.

825
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:35,179
It'll only take a minute.

826
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,486
Oh, all right.

827
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:44,491
I guess I can trust you,

828
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,360
being a man of the law.

829
00:58:46,432 --> 00:58:48,832
Yes, ma'am.

830
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,232
Thank you, ma'am.

831
00:59:18,998 --> 00:59:22,297
Oh, this one looks familiar.
Is he on the TV?

832
00:59:22,368 --> 00:59:25,064
No, ma'am,
I don't believe he is.

833
00:59:28,674 --> 00:59:29,732
- Wydell?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

834
00:59:29,809 --> 00:59:32,539
- Wydell, over! Wydell, over!
- Wydell, over.

835
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:08,028
Let me take a guess here.
Y'all havin' a Halloween Party.

836
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,091
What makes you think that,
big boy?

837
01:02:10,169 --> 01:02:13,866
You sure are buying a whole mess
of holy water for two people.

838
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,772
We like to get fucked up
and do fucked up shit.

839
01:02:16,842 --> 01:02:19,777
- You know what I mean?
- I like to get fucked up too.

840
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,973
- Do some fucked up shit.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

841
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:26,017
How much we owe ya, goober?

842
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:29,714
Actually it's G. Ober,
for Gerry Ober,

843
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:33,280
but the new guy, Romald in the back,
he drew in that other O

844
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,884
and made Goober.
Fucking asshole.

845
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,452
Great story, Goober.
How much we owe ya?

846
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:41,431
The damage is quite severe.

847
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,560
- $185.
- That ain't gonna break my bank.

848
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:49,073
Here, keep the change and go
get yourself a new name, Goober.

849
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:51,735
Holy dog, I will, thank you.

850
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:56,543
You all drive safe. Thanks for
comin' in to Red Hot Pussy Liquor.

851
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:26,975
Where's Otis? Where's Otis?

852
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:29,207
He's comin'. He's got
something real special this year.

853
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:31,715
Otis, Otis, Otis...

854
01:04:03,782 --> 01:04:07,741
I'm the one who brings
the Christmas candy.

855
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,788
Now tell me,

856
01:04:09,855 --> 01:04:11,823
who's your daddy?

857
01:04:15,327 --> 01:04:17,989
I'm the one who brings
the devil's brandy.

858
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:19,860
Who's your daddy?!

859
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,829
I'm the one who beats you
when you're bad.

860
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:30,671
- Who's your Daddy?!
- Who's your Daddy?!

861
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:41,446
Come on, sweetie,
give the old man some sugar.

862
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:47,690
Daddy, Daddy.

863
01:04:50,696 --> 01:04:52,823
And I'm the one who loves ya

864
01:04:52,898 --> 01:04:54,490
when you're fucking dead.

865
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:58,960
Who's your Daddy?!
Who's your Daddy?!

866
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:01,699
Well, I say my little darlings.

867
01:05:03,175 --> 01:05:05,541
Maybe it ain't a good idea to be
prancing around

868
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:07,272
where you don't belong.

869
01:05:07,346 --> 01:05:11,680
And you,
the great rusher of fools,

870
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,581
what was it that you were after?

871
01:05:13,652 --> 01:05:17,088
Come on, speak to me, boy.
I remember now.

872
01:05:17,156 --> 01:05:18,783
Dr. Satan.

873
01:05:18,857 --> 01:05:21,758
Goddamn it, everybody
got to know about Dr. Satan.

874
01:05:21,827 --> 01:05:24,318
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna do you a favor.

875
01:05:24,396 --> 01:05:26,489
I'm gonna let you
meet the old bastard.

876
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:30,494
It's all true.

877
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:34,164
The bogeyman is real
and you found him.

878
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:37,538
<i>And you found him...</i>

879
01:06:39,004 --> 01:06:42,167
Hey, happy boy,
step your ass up here.

880
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:46,143
Take his gag out.
It's more fun with the screaming.

881
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:50,409
I like that too. That screaming
is much more exciting that way.

882
01:06:54,086 --> 01:06:56,145
Please don't kill us,
please don't kill us.

883
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,212
Please don't kill us...
nah... please don't kill us.

884
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:01,589
Shut your mouth
and get your shit in the box.

885
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:07,128
- Get in now.
Wait, wait, wait...

886
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,360
I wanna say goodbye.

887
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:21,202
Goodbye, sweetie.

888
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,147
We could've been great.

889
01:07:24,216 --> 01:07:26,343
Just let us go, I swear to God
we won't tell anyone.

890
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:30,855
- I swear...
- Honey, you know I can't do that.

891
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:34,684
I swear to God,
we won't tell. I swear to God.

892
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,523
Ain't we just having a fucking hoot?

893
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,654
Get your fucking ass up, boy.

894
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:41,722
Come on, we ain't got all night.

895
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,268
Where does she think
she's gonna run to?

896
01:07:44,336 --> 01:07:47,772
- She gonna run all the way home?
- No, let me get her.

897
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,238
All right, go get her.

898
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:56,470
Huntin' humans,
ain't nothin' but nothin'.

899
01:07:56,548 --> 01:07:59,016
They all run like
scared little rabbits.

900
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:02,845
Run, rabbit, run.

901
01:08:04,489 --> 01:08:05,421
Run, rabbit.

902
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:09,090
Run, rabbit. Run, rabbit.

903
01:08:10,495 --> 01:08:12,087
Run, rabbit, run!

904
01:08:13,332 --> 01:08:14,526
Run, rabbit!

905
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,273
<i>There once was a woman</i>

906
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:25,572
<i>who lived with her daughter</i>
<i>in a cabbage garden.</i>

907
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:29,307
<i>Along came a rabbit</i>
<i>and ate up all the cabbages.</i>

908
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:33,283
<i>The woman said, "Go into the garden</i>
<i>and drive out the rabbit. "</i>

909
01:08:33,352 --> 01:08:35,547
<i>Mary.</i>

910
01:08:35,621 --> 01:08:38,522
<i>Told you.</i>
<i>I'm gonna get you.</i>

911
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:40,649
<i>Mary.</i>

912
01:08:40,726 --> 01:08:42,250
<i>Mary...</i>

913
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:46,161
<i>I'm gonna get you.</i>
<i>I'm coming to get you.</i>

914
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:19,927
"Shoo, shoo," said the maiden.

915
01:09:24,636 --> 01:09:27,196
"Come, maiden," said the rabbit.

916
01:09:27,272 --> 01:09:31,368
"Sit on my tail and go with me
to my rabbit hutch."

917
01:09:40,919 --> 01:09:43,649
No-ooo, no!

918
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:47,715
No hanky-panky.
Rufus, put the lid on.

919
01:09:47,793 --> 01:09:49,818
No-ooo!

920
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,595
No-ooo!

921
01:10:02,307 --> 01:10:03,706
Oh, no!

922
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:14,680
No!

923
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:18,587
No, no, no!

924
01:10:18,657 --> 01:10:21,353
Stop! No!

925
01:10:33,004 --> 01:10:34,733
No!

926
01:10:43,048 --> 01:10:44,811
No-ooo!

927
01:10:46,985 --> 01:10:49,852
No, no-ooo!

928
01:11:13,578 --> 01:11:17,241
Bury me in a nameless grave.

929
01:11:27,192 --> 01:11:30,389
Bury me in a nameless grave.

930
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:34,296
Jerry, wake up, wake...

931
01:11:34,366 --> 01:11:35,924
Jerry, wake up, wake up, wake up.

932
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:44,967
Bury me in a nameless grave.

933
01:11:54,553 --> 01:11:58,717
Bury me in a nameless grave.

934
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:05,128
Oh my God!

935
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:22,172
No-ooo!
- Jerry!

936
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:25,273
No, Jerry!

937
01:12:42,467 --> 01:12:45,903
<i>Please! Help!</i>

938

Jerry? Is that you?

942
01:13:04,556 --> 01:13:06,820
Jerry?

943
01:13:06,892 --> 01:13:11,192
Jerry? Thank God.

Please help me.

Jerry?

Oh, God, no, no, no...

No!

God, no, no.

No, no!

No-ooo!

954
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:16,710
Go away!

955
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,454
Go away!

956
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:42,918
Sweet baby Jesus, girl.
What the hell happened to you?

957
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:45,861
I got away.

958
01:23:48,332 --> 01:23:50,300
I recognize you.

959
01:23:50,368 --> 01:23:53,098
There's a whole bunch of people
been looking for your ass.

960
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:56,503
- I gotta get to a doctor.
- All right, all right.

961
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:58,542
Just sit back and relax.

962
01:23:58,609 --> 01:24:00,839
I'll get you to a doctor.

963
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,516
Come on... that's it,
that's it.

964
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:09,144
I'll get you there,
yeah, yeah.

965
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:55,823
Oh, yeah!
