1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,442
LET THE RIGHT ONE IN

2
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,652
Squeal like a pig.

3
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,856
Squeal!

4
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,605
Squeal!

5
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,777
Squeal like a pig!

6
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,140
The police have many ways
to find out if something's fishy.

7
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,312
Remember the house
that burned down in Ängby?

8
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,590
A house that burned
to the ground.

9
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,425
They found someone in there.
Dead, of course.

10
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:34,923
In that case
we knew it was arson

11
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,731
because the person
had been murdered.

12
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,171
How could we know that?

13
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,072
Yes?

14
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:47,637
Because there wasn't
any smoke in the lungs.

15
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,944
That's correct.

16
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,610
How did you figure it out?

17
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,520
I read a lot.

18
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,922
What kind of books,
I wonder?

19
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,921
Newspapers
and things like that.

20
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,223
And now we can talk a little
about drugs.

21
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,260
What kinds are
the most common...

22
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,772
Oskar!

23
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,579
What are you staring at?
Huh?

24
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,877
You staring at me?

25
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,548
You better stop.

26
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,131
Good job, pig!

27
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,769
On the coast,
just a few degrees below zero.

28
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,677
Eastern Svealand-
clear tonight...

29
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,717
intermittent snow flurries...

30
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,881
temperatures ranging
from 20-32 degrees...

31
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,233
Excuse me...?

32
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,400
What time is it?

33
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,672
I don't have a watch.

34
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,236
What's that?

35
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,738
It's called Halotan.

36
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,528
Ricky!

37
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,465
Ricky!

38
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,811
Get lost!

39
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,007
Ricky?

40
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,355
Ricky?

41
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,128
Darned dog!

42
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,568
Ricky!

43
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,192
What are you looking at?

44
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,534
Huh?

45
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,871
Looking at me?

46
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,674
You better quit.

47
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,674
What's wrong with you?

48
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,815
Are you scared?

49
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,254
Squeal then!

50
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,282
Squeal!

51
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,896
What are you doing?

52
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,602
Nothing.

53
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,339
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

54
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,275
- Do you live here?
- Yes...

55
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,717
I live here.

56
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,245
Okay.
Where do you live?

57
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,389
Next to you.

58
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,421
How do you know
where I live?

59
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,837
I can't be friends
with you.

60
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,306
Just so you know.

61
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,277
Why?

62
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:38,045
That's just how it is.

63
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,455
Do you think
I want to be friends with you?

64
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,814
I've told you
you have to help me!

65
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,903
Do I have to do it myself?

66
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,910
Say something!

67
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,147
Sorry.

68
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,723
So no one knows
why this boy was murdered.

69
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,192
I understand
that many of you are scared,

70
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,995
but the counselor
will be here all day.

71
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,231
You can talk to her
whenever you want.

72
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,398
Does anyone
have any questions?

73
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,703
If we meet the murderer,
can we murder him?

74
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,635
Conny, that was
unnecessary.

75
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,646
Oskar!

76
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,186
Oskar!

77
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,327
Oskar!

78
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,618
You will go straight home
after school!

79
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,393
And you're not to leave the yard
until I come home.

80
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,491
But it was in Vällingby.

81
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,799
So you think someone
who murders children

82
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,102
can't take the subway?

83
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,473
Or walk a kilometer?

84
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,453
Yes, that would be best...

85
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,857
He's going to his father's
next week...

86
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,730
Murder in Vällingby
MURDERER DRAINED VICTIM'S BLOOD

87
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,138
Senseless massacre in Beirut

88
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,548
No survivors in Arab murders
manhunt for killer continues

89
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,554
Eyewitness identifies murderer
prior to confession

90
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,727
MURDER DRAINED HIS VICTIM

91
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,852
...just coming- hi, there.

92
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,366
I really don't think
the death penalty

93
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,704
has any relevance
in our society.

94
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,201
It's just something

95
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,872
they've drilled into us-

96
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,939
like the Russians
or something-

97
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,474
Are you saying
there aren't any Russians?

98
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,885
Of course
there are Russians.

99
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,947
Never seen him before.

100
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,960
Who's been bitten
by a snake here?

101
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,726
He moved into my building
the other day. With a little kid.

102
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,902
- Should I ask him over?
- Yes, ask him!

103
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,074
What the hell?

104
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,809
In that case...

105
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,657
Things not going too well?

106
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,121
It's screwed up.

107
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,098
You moved into #15?

108
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,769
Why sit by yourself?
Come over instead.

109
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,245
I'm kind of in a hurry.

110
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,449
Mom?

111
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,460
I'm going out
for a while.

112
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,952
Aren't you going
to watch the rest?

113
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,228
No, it wasn't any good.

114
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,701
Stay in the yard, then, okay?

115
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,174
Well, I'll watch
the rest anyway.

116
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,887
You're here again?

117
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,914
Are you here again?

118
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,484
I want to be left alone.

119
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,360
Me too.

120
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,524
Go home, then!

121
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,797
You go home.
I've lived here longer.

122
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,408
What's that?

123
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,471
This?
It's a Rubik's cube.

124
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,110
Is it a puzzle?

125
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,143
Yes.

126
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,893
You want
to borrow it?

127
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,990
Till tomorrow.

128
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,365
I might not be here
tomorrow.

129
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,269
That's okay.
You can borrow it till Monday.

130
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,384
How does it work?

131
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,790
You try to get the sides
one color.

132
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,158
Like this.

133
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,524
You smell funny.

134
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,834
Aren't you cold?

135
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,837
- No.
- Why not?

136
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,169
I guess
I've forgotten how.

137
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,281
Guess I'll see you
Monday, then.

138
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,180
Okay.

139
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,586
Okay.

140
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:17,152
Thanks for tonight.

141
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,129
Bye, old pal.

142
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,760
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

143
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,999
- You're the best.
- You too.

144
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,221
Help me.

145
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,397
Hello?

146
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,935
Please, help me.

147
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,137
Has something
happened?

148
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,348
Are you hurt?

149
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,026
- Can you get up?
- No.

150
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,297
I'll carry you.
Can we call somewhere?

151
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,808
Careful.

152
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,708
You don't weigh
anything-

153
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,011
Gösta?
Hey, Gösta!

154
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,537
It's been a long time.

155
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,312
- Jocke...
- What?

156
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,946
Jocke-

157
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,254
There was an animal
behind-

158
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,456
and then I saw Jocke-
and a little kid.

159
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,936
It was here somewhere.

160
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,668
Look!

161
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,148
Damn.

162
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,743
Blood.

163
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,720
It's blood, damn it!

164
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,451
Who the hell did this?

165
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,704
Whew...

166
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,997
How did you do it?

167
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,534
I turned it.

168
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,241
Do I smell better?

169
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,588
What's your name?

170
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,595
Eli.

171
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,221
What's yours?

172
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:10,325
- Eli?
- Yeah.

173
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,269
My name is Oskar.

174
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,240
How old are you?

175
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,732
Twelve- about.

176
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,475
And you?

177
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,948
12 years, eight months,
and nine days.

178
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,077
What do you mean,
"about 12"?

179
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,386
When's your birthday?

180
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,416
I don't know.

181
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:41,262
But, like,
when were you born?

182
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,666
Your parents-
they have to know.

183
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,543
You never
get any presents?

184
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,673
No.

185
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,644
You can have this if you want.

186
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,386
It's yours.

187
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,763
I don't get how you did it.

188
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,860
You want me to show you?

189
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,404
Show me.

190
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,933
You have
to start here...

191
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,243
then you take
this side. See?

192
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,725
"He slipped in and out
among the tree shadows.

193
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,995
He ran quickly and quietly
and was careful to avoid the light.

194
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,400
Soon they returned
to watch the gate,

195
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,772
muttering
and swearing.

196
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,575
Bilbo was saved. "

197
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,613
Well then,
that's it for today!

198
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,384
Do you all have the slips
for Thursday's field trip?

199
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,653
Thank you for today.

200
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,296
- Oskar, aren't you going?
- No, I have some things to do.

201
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,013
Samuel Morse

202
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,571
What were you writing?

203
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,509
What do you mean?

204
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,843
Let me see.

205
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,022
No.

206
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,547
What do you mean, no?
Give it here!

207
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,119
Who's gonna talk
to his mom now?

208
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,452
Wait!

209
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,187
Oskar!

210
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,634
Oskar!

211
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,029
I fell at recess.

212
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,606
I fell on a rock.

213
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:24,308
Oh, darling.

214
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,078
You have to be careful.

215
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,718
Hmm?

216
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:45,926
Short, long,
long, short, long.

217
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,461
Exactly.

218
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,498
Here.

219
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,078
What happened?

220
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,541
Here.

221
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,587
Some kids in my class.

222
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,865
Where do you
go to school, anyway?

223
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,925
Oskar, listen.

224
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,906
You have to fight back.

225
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,167
You've never hit them back...

226
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,975
have you?

227
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,852
Start hitting back now-

228
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,878
hard.

229
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,585
There are three of them.

230
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,095
Then you have to hit
even harder!

231
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,121
Hit back harder
than you dare.

232
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,099
Then they'll stop.

233
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,934
- But if they-
- Then I'll help you.

234
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,702
I can.

235
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,519
Come.

236
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,125
Come.

237
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,418
Move over.

238
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,399
Short, short...

239
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,871
S- s-s...

240
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,848
Ooh-hh...

241
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,314
Vuh...

242
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,581
Guh...

243
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,819
Keep the distance!

244
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,987
Not too near, not too far.

245
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,156
Keep the distance!

246
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,237
Just so. Calmly.

247
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,736
Yes?

248
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:48,908
That strength training class
in the bathhouse...

249
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,320
can I sign up for it?

250
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,347
You don't have to sign up,
just come.

251
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,919
At 7:00.
You want to?

252
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:01,193
- Yes.
- Good!

253
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,429
You'll train, then you can go
about 50 times.

254
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,336
At least.

255
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,204
Wait a minute...

256
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,580
Mixed.

257
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,717
Here.

258
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,231
No.

259
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,965
Too bad.

260
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:48,271
I can... try one.

261
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,350
I'm sorry.

262
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,799
Oskar...

263
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,037
do you like me?

264
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,878
Yes, a lot.

265
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,145
If I weren't a girl,

266
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,711
would you like me
anyway?

267
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,119
I guess so.

268
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,725
Why?

269
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,925
Oskar!
Hi, buddy!

270
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,962
- You're early.
- Hi, Dad!

271
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:28,557
There are people
who recognize my face

272
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,432
who know I live here,
with you.

273
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:37,805
- Maybe you shouldn't.
- Where else would you be?

274
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,442
Can you do
something for me?

275
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:51,216
Not see that boy
this evening?

276
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,109
What the hell?

277
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:33,646
- Where's Matte?
- Don't know.

278
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,230
Hey! Matte?

279
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,264
Matte!
Time to go home!

280
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:56,273
Matte?
What are you doing?

281
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,480
Open the door.

282
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,488
Matte!

283
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,253
Let me down!

284
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,488
Let me down!

285
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,467
Help!

286
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,140
Help!

287
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,416
Matte?

288
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,112
Help!

289
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,519
Turn the handle!

290
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,787
Help!

291
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,458
Help!

292
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,194
Help!

293
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,064
Help!

294
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,268
Help...?

295
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,416
Help!

296
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,016
How did you
end up there?

297
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,129
I'm trapped.

298
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:03,329
...police have not been able
to confirm the identity

299
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,700
of the man who was
apprehended last night

300
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:10,798
on suspicion of murder
and attempted murder

301
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,776
in Vällingby,
in western Stockholm.

302
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,335
Identification was difficult

303
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,713
because the man injured himself
severely before his arrest.

304
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,980
In sports...

305
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,217
Just go in.

306
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,069
Yes?

307
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,079
Sorry.

308
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,911
I'm looking for my dad.

309
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,474
Is he here?

310
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,249
What's his name?

311
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,451
He's sick.

312
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,686
The police took him.

313
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,787
Where could he be?

314
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,290
Then he's on Level 7.

315
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,167
But you can't
just go in there.

316
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,365
- I can call-
- No.

317
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,000
It's not necessary.

318
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,341
You poor thing.

319
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,981
Can I come in?

320
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,179
Wake up, Virginia.

321
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,850
- A kid!
- What goddamn kid?

322
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,919
Why the hell would a kid
want to kill Jocke?

323
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,022
I don't know.

324
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:32,501
Jocke was the kindest
person I know.

325
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,171
I'll rip that damned kid
to shreds.

326
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,039
Oskar!

327
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,308
Can I come in?

328
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,154
Don't look.

329
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,554
But say
I can come in.

330
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,526
Come in.

331
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,332
Close your eyes.

332
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,819
How did you get here?

333
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,687
I flew.

334
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,420
Okay.

335
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,792
But you're not
wearing any clothes.

336
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,526
You're ice cold!

337
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,093
Sorry.

338
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,334
Is it yucky?

339
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,772
No.

340
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,410
"Bulleri, bulleri bock

341
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,976
How many fingers
am I tapping you with?"

342
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,020
Eli...

343
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,560
Do I have a chance
with you?

344
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,668
With what?

345
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,173
I mean...

346
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:22,142
Do you want to go steady?

347
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,275
Oskar,
I'm not a girl.

348
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,312
No?

349
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,450
Do I have
a chance with you?

350
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,121
Can't we just
be like this?

351
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,965
Yes.

352
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,836
Do you do something
special then?

353
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,332
No.

354
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,643
Is everything like usual?

355
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,817
Yes.

356
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,157
- Then you have a chance with me.
- What?

357
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,185
Then we're together.

358
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:16,757
- Really?
- Yes.

359
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,038
Good.

360
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,115
TO FLEE IS LIFE,
TO LINGER, DEATH.

361
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,242
YOUR ELl

362
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,018
Lower grades, with me!

363
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:30,829
Middle grades, free skating.

364
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:36,396
Watch out
for the ice pit over there!

365
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,076
Listen to me!

366
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,874
- Avila...?
- Understood?

367
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,972
Avila...

368
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,075
- it's called an ice hole.
- Ice hole?

369
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:55,195
I mean, ice hole!

370
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:57,999
You want to swim?

371
01:00:58,331 --> 01:01:00,799
Are you going to swim?

372
01:01:06,072 --> 01:01:07,471
No.

373
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:13,542
Teacher, teacher?
I have to go pee.

374
01:01:13,579 --> 01:01:17,379
- Pee over by the tree.
- On the ice?

375
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:20,818
So what?
It'll be new ice. Yellow.

376
01:01:23,356 --> 01:01:25,881
What are you going to do
with the stick?

377
01:01:25,925 --> 01:01:29,554
I'll hit you-
If you try anything.

378
01:01:30,596 --> 01:01:32,826
Did the pig
suddenly get brave?

379
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,932
I'm going to skate over to you
and push you over.

380
01:01:41,974 --> 01:01:43,999
You won't do anything.

381
01:01:44,043 --> 01:01:46,034
Am I right?

382
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,775
Little piggy...

383
01:01:48,815 --> 01:01:52,307
watch out...

384
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:58,681
Look.

385
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:03,161
Come on.

386
01:02:03,196 --> 01:02:07,189
The teacher's coming.
He'll be mad.

387
01:02:07,233 --> 01:02:10,134
So are you just
going to stand there?

388
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:31,014
What's going on
over there?

389
01:02:32,492 --> 01:02:34,960
Oskar!
What are you doing?

390
01:03:02,054 --> 01:03:04,249
Come on.

391
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:28,909
POLICE

392
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:44,754
Yes, it is.
Now he's coming.

393
01:03:46,466 --> 01:03:49,128
They've called from school.

394
01:03:49,168 --> 01:03:51,636
And you can talk to your dad,
because I-

395
01:03:54,073 --> 01:03:56,371
Hello?

396
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:58,934
I'm okay.

397
01:03:58,978 --> 01:04:01,344
I don't know.

398
01:04:02,982 --> 01:04:05,815
Come up?

399
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:07,649
We'll see.

400
01:04:45,525 --> 01:04:48,119
Hey, Oskar.

401
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:52,587
So you're going to swim
after all.

402
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:56,564
I'm just kidding.

403
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:20,248
We're not allowed
to be here, really.

404
01:05:22,728 --> 01:05:25,561
This cellar is the best place.
We can do whatever we want.

405
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:33,361
You know, today...

406
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:35,670
they tried to throw me
into a hole in the ice...

407
01:05:36,676 --> 01:05:38,337
Oskar-

408
01:05:38,377 --> 01:05:41,141
But I had a stick,

409
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,205
and I hit Conny
in the head

410
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:45,479
so he had to go
to the hospital.

411
01:05:45,518 --> 01:05:47,850
Oskar...?

412
01:05:48,888 --> 01:05:51,948
Huh?

413
01:05:53,192 --> 01:05:55,319
Hooray!

414
01:06:47,546 --> 01:06:49,912
What were we going to do?

415
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:27,450
We're going to mix.

416
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:30,717
It doesn't hurt at all.

417
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:34,889
All you have to do
is prick your finger.

418
01:07:54,413 --> 01:07:57,439
Eli?

419
01:08:01,387 --> 01:08:04,151
Eli?

420
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,851
Go!

421
01:08:07,293 --> 01:08:09,921
Get out of here!

422
01:08:50,035 --> 01:08:52,526
Damn it, they had to saw
through that ice.

423
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:57,474
What the hell
are you worrying about?

424
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,671
Interrogation, and stuff.

425
01:08:59,712 --> 01:09:01,236
Interrogation!

426
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,272
Maybe they'll put me
in one of those rooms...

427
01:09:05,317 --> 01:09:07,285
and shine a light on me-

428
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:12,653
- Jocke and I, we were this close-
- I'm sorry, I can't do it.

429
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,784
In fact...

430
01:09:14,827 --> 01:09:19,059
it is actually a duty
to testify.

431
01:09:19,098 --> 01:09:21,896
Hell.

432
01:09:21,934 --> 01:09:25,028
I have nothing left...

433
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:30,033
now that he's gone.

434
01:09:34,413 --> 01:09:37,780
- But Lacke-
- Stop that shit!

435
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:40,251
Don't give me your
goddamn "Lacke, Lacke. "

436
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:44,655
You don't
understand shit.

437
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,284
You're cold,
fucking ice cold!

438
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:57,028
Ow-!

439
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:03,371
You handled that
just fucking great, Lacke.

440
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,837
Virginia!

441
01:10:16,355 --> 01:10:18,983
Wait!
Can't we talk about it?

442
01:10:29,702 --> 01:10:32,068
Listen-

443
01:10:52,758 --> 01:10:55,454
Help me! Help me!

444
01:10:55,494 --> 01:10:58,554
- Get the fuck off her!
- Help me!

445
01:11:09,742 --> 01:11:11,869
Ginia?

446
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:16,143
Wait up!

447
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:18,172
What's going on up there?

448
01:13:34,186 --> 01:13:37,451
- I didn't see that one.
- As usual.

449
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,888
Now I'll get you.

450
01:13:40,926 --> 01:13:43,019
You can always dream.

451
01:13:54,673 --> 01:13:57,870
- We have a guest.
- Hello to you.

452
01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:06,317
So...

453
01:14:06,351 --> 01:14:08,444
you're sitting here
having a good time.

454
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:10,682
Yes.

455
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:14,959
So Oskar is here.

456
01:14:30,342 --> 01:14:34,301
Dad?
It's your turn.

457
01:14:35,314 --> 01:14:37,407
Yes, yes.
But we have a guest now.

458
01:14:38,484 --> 01:14:40,884
You have it nice
and warm in here.

459
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:49,123
So there was some
at home, after all.

460
01:15:25,564 --> 01:15:29,364
TO FLEE IS LIFE,
TO LINGER, DEATH.

461
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:32,802
YOUR ELl

462
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:27,114
It went wrong, you see.

463
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:29,923
I had figured it out
so it would be perfect.

464
01:16:29,962 --> 01:16:32,123
Maybe there was something
wrong with the set square,

465
01:16:32,164 --> 01:16:35,998
or the ruler, or...

466
01:16:36,034 --> 01:16:38,366
Nothing to be scared of, kitty.

467
01:16:38,403 --> 01:16:40,394
And it was more
and more wrong.

468
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:43,897
And now I walk around
and it feels like-

469
01:16:43,942 --> 01:16:46,342
Awful lot of traffic
this evening!

470
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:50,207
Come in!

471
01:17:06,231 --> 01:17:09,029
Ginia! Where the hell
have you been?

472
01:17:12,371 --> 01:17:14,532
What are you doing?

473
01:17:14,573 --> 01:17:16,473
I need to talk to you,
damn it!

474
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:18,373
- We've been so fucking worried!
- No!

475
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:21,379
I have to hold you.

476
01:17:21,413 --> 01:17:23,540
We've been
so fucking worried.

477
01:17:25,317 --> 01:17:28,650
- Are you crazy?
- Let go of me!

478
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:31,417
What's happening
with the cats?

479
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:35,159
What's happening
with the cats?

480
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,354
- Let us out, you bastard!
- Let go of me! Help!

481
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,592
Oskar, is it you?

482
01:18:18,637 --> 01:18:20,935
Yes.

483
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:25,129
Are you a vampire?

484
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:32,472
I live off blood.

485
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:34,342
Yes.

486
01:19:36,114 --> 01:19:38,605
Are-

487
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:42,076
are you dead?

488
01:19:43,588 --> 01:19:45,783
No.

489
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:47,815
Can't you tell?

490
01:19:51,563 --> 01:19:54,623
But are you...

491
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:58,158
old?

492
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:02,371
I'm twelve.

493
01:20:02,407 --> 01:20:05,137
Though I've been 12
for a long time.

494
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:33,561
Are you guys poor?

495
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,941
- You see the egg there?
- Mm-hmm.

496
01:20:38,977 --> 01:20:43,346
If you sold that you could buy
a nuclear power plant.

497
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:45,076
It's true.

498
01:20:45,116 --> 01:20:49,348
Oh. Sure.

499
01:20:52,991 --> 01:20:55,289
Put your finger here.

500
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:14,671
Those rings-

501
01:21:14,713 --> 01:21:16,908
where did they come from?

502
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,148
I'm going home now.

503
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:26,589
I'm going to deliver
chocolates tomorrow.

504
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:31,358
To earn money?

505
01:21:31,396 --> 01:21:33,489
Um-hmm.

506
01:21:33,532 --> 01:21:35,659
But you can have money
from me.

507
01:21:42,908 --> 01:21:44,671
Here.

508
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:47,439
Take it if you want.

509
01:21:52,183 --> 01:21:55,346
You've stolen it!

510
01:21:56,388 --> 01:21:59,551
As soon
as they're dead, right?

511
01:21:59,591 --> 01:22:02,059
- It was given to me.
- By whom?

512
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:04,687
Different people.

513
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:10,499
I want to go home now.

514
01:22:14,005 --> 01:22:16,803
If I may.

515
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:33,114
Dad's stamp collection.
His whole life.

516
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,354
One stamp...

517
01:22:43,535 --> 01:22:45,799
80,000.

518
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:49,136
80 big ones!

519
01:22:49,174 --> 01:22:52,143
Sometimes I tried to be interested.
I said, "I won't tell. "

520
01:22:52,177 --> 01:22:54,771
He just said, "No, there are others.
Thank you very much. "

521
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:03,520
There isn't a prettier place.

522
01:23:07,425 --> 01:23:11,191
Larks, potatoes-

523
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:16,133
Lacke,
you have to help me!

524
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:20,035
Of course.

525
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:23,404
- That child.
- Yeah?

526
01:23:23,441 --> 01:23:26,774
She must have infected me.

527
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:31,345
I don't want to live.

528
01:24:28,073 --> 01:24:29,540
Good morning!

529
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:34,238
This looks good-
you'll be able to go home today.

530
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:36,372
Good.

531
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:41,483
I'll just open this...

532
01:24:41,519 --> 01:24:44,283
and take a little blood sample.

533
01:24:44,322 --> 01:24:46,313
There.

534
01:24:47,659 --> 01:24:50,594
- Sir?
- Yes?

535
01:24:52,197 --> 01:24:55,098
Could you open
the shutters, please?

536
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:58,635
Sure.

537
01:25:11,516 --> 01:25:14,212
Give me the cap.

538
01:25:14,252 --> 01:25:17,551
Give it to me!

539
01:25:19,057 --> 01:25:21,184
Are you stupid?

540
01:25:29,768 --> 01:25:32,566
- Hi.
- Hi. What's up?

541
01:25:32,604 --> 01:25:34,094
Can I borrow the keys?

542
01:25:34,139 --> 01:25:37,233
- Why?
- I'm going home.

543
01:25:37,275 --> 01:25:39,709
Sure. Here.

544
01:25:39,744 --> 01:25:41,735
Thanks.

545
01:26:11,276 --> 01:26:14,074
- Hi.
- Hey.

546
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:25,519
You have to ask me in.

547
01:26:26,524 --> 01:26:28,685
What happens if I don't?

548
01:26:30,962 --> 01:26:33,021
What happens
if you come in anyway?

549
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:37,465
Is there anything
in here?

550
01:26:40,271 --> 01:26:42,603
Tsk-tsk-tsk...

551
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,606
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

552
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,494
No!

553
01:27:43,534 --> 01:27:46,526
You can come in!

554
01:27:57,415 --> 01:27:59,679
Who are you?

555
01:28:02,186 --> 01:28:04,984
The same as you.

556
01:28:05,023 --> 01:28:07,457
What?

557
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:11,258
"What are you
looking at, huh?

558
01:28:11,296 --> 01:28:14,231
Are you looking
at me?

559
01:28:14,265 --> 01:28:18,361
Then squeal like a pig!
Squeal!"

560
01:28:20,538 --> 01:28:23,507
That was the first thing
I heard you say.

561
01:28:28,046 --> 01:28:30,071
I don't kill people.

562
01:28:30,114 --> 01:28:31,479
No...

563
01:28:31,516 --> 01:28:34,451
but you'd like to,

564
01:28:34,485 --> 01:28:36,316
if you could.

565
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:39,289
To get even.

566
01:28:39,324 --> 01:28:41,519
Right?

567
01:28:41,559 --> 01:28:43,322
Yes.

568
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:45,989
Oskar, I do it
because I have to.

569
01:28:49,634 --> 01:28:52,228
Be me a little.

570
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:18,623
Please, Oskar...

571
01:29:18,663 --> 01:29:21,598
be me a little.

572
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:17,053
You can borrow
a dress from my mom.

573
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:55,690
Oskar, can you open?

574
01:31:03,067 --> 01:31:06,594
Coming!
I'm in the bathroom.

575
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:41,990
Hl! I'M IN THE BATHROOM.
PLEASE DON'T COME IN.

576
01:32:42,033 --> 01:32:45,093
DO YOU WANT TO MEET ME TONIGHT?

577
01:32:45,136 --> 01:32:48,299
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH. - YOUR ELl

578
01:36:38,769 --> 01:36:39,895
No!

579
01:36:39,937 --> 01:36:42,098
Huh?

580
01:36:50,548 --> 01:36:53,813
Let go! Let go!

581
01:37:41,465 --> 01:37:43,990
Thank you.

582
01:37:48,205 --> 01:37:50,673
Oskar...

583
01:37:54,712 --> 01:37:57,579
I have to go.

584
01:39:18,963 --> 01:39:23,263
WHO MURDERED THE MAN
IN THE ICE?

585
01:41:28,559 --> 01:41:30,527
Hello.

586
01:41:30,561 --> 01:41:33,257
- Oskar, are you there?
- Yeah.

587
01:41:33,297 --> 01:41:35,390
It's Martin.

588
01:41:35,432 --> 01:41:39,061
Teacher was wondering
if you're coming to practice tonight.

589
01:41:40,437 --> 01:41:42,234
How come?

590
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:45,264
Don't know.
He was just wondering.

591
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:50,007
Maybe he wanted you
to come.

592
01:41:50,047 --> 01:41:52,607
I don't know...

593
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:54,446
By the way...

594
01:41:54,485 --> 01:41:57,420
I think it was good,
what you did to Conny.

595
01:41:57,454 --> 01:41:59,945
He needed it.

596
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:02,754
Damn,
he's good at acting!

597
01:42:02,793 --> 01:42:05,125
- You think so?
- Yes.

598
01:42:05,162 --> 01:42:07,687
You coming
to training tonight?

599
01:42:08,766 --> 01:42:13,726
POOL

600
01:42:32,556 --> 01:42:35,218
Hi, Oskar.

601
01:42:36,226 --> 01:42:38,524
Hi.

602
01:42:43,233 --> 01:42:45,428
Hey, Oskar.

603
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,868
Hey.

604
01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:55,105
Now we'll start
water exercises.

605
01:43:08,492 --> 01:43:10,756
Hurry up!

606
01:43:23,473 --> 01:43:25,168
Come on, Oskar!

607
01:43:25,209 --> 01:43:28,269
Vamos, vamos!
Uno, dos, uno dos-

608
01:43:28,312 --> 01:43:30,303
keep going!

609
01:43:40,157 --> 01:43:42,819
What? Damn it!

610
01:44:00,244 --> 01:44:03,008
Call the fire department!
Fire!

611
01:44:24,902 --> 01:44:26,961
Get out of here!

612
01:44:27,971 --> 01:44:29,962
Out!

613
01:45:06,877 --> 01:45:09,345
Do you know who I am?

614
01:45:10,814 --> 01:45:12,679
- Yes.
- Good.

615
01:45:12,716 --> 01:45:14,616
Then you understand.

616
01:45:14,651 --> 01:45:16,482
We're going to have
a little contest now.

617
01:45:18,288 --> 01:45:20,813
You'll stay under water...

618
01:45:22,459 --> 01:45:24,654
for three minutes.

619
01:45:24,695 --> 01:45:27,596
Do that, and it's just
a little scratch.

620
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:31,426
If you don't...

621
01:45:31,468 --> 01:45:34,437
I'll cut out your eye.

622
01:45:34,471 --> 01:45:36,530
An eye
for an ear, okay?

623
01:45:38,842 --> 01:45:41,902
But... it's impossible.

624
01:45:41,945 --> 01:45:44,277
That's your problem.

625
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,660
Three minutes.

626
01:46:00,664 --> 01:46:02,393
Breathe now!

627
01:46:04,868 --> 01:46:07,063
Five...

628
01:46:07,104 --> 01:46:08,867
four...

629
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:10,031
three...

630
01:46:10,073 --> 01:46:12,541
two... one.

631
01:46:50,781 --> 01:46:53,113
- Jimmy-
- Shut up!

632
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:56,017
- Let's get out of here.
- Shut up, I said!
