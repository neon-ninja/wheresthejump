1
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,364
Are you Henry?

2
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:36,862
Yes.

3
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,695
Girl named Marry called
on the pay-phone.

4
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,317
Said she's set her parents
and you're invited to dinner.

5
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,274
Oh, yeah?

6
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:58,935
Thank you very much.

7
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,083
You're late, Henry.

8
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:18,743
I didn't know if you wanted me
to come or not. Where have you been?

9
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,493
You never come
around anymore.

10
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,557
Dinner's almost ready.

11
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:01,082
Come on in.

12
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:29,665
Hello there.

13
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,004
Hello.

14
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,010
I'm very pleased to meet you.

15
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:43,435
Sit down.

16
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,896
It's Henry. isn't it?

17
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:17,234
Yes.

18
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:41,019
Marry tells me you're a very
nice fellow. What do you do?

19
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:45,191
I-I am on vacation.

20
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:48,947
What did you do?

21
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,284
Oh, I'm sorry.

22
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:58,544
I work in the Lapell's factory.

23
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,134
I am a printer.

24
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:06,889
Henry is very clever in printing.

25
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:12,731
Yes, he sounds very clever.

26
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:25,666
I thought I heard a stranger.

27
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,131
We've got chicken tonight. Strangest
damn things, they're man-made.

28
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,760
Little damn things,
smaller than my fist.

29
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:35,263
But they're new.

30
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:37,350
I'm Bill.

31
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:44,860
- Hello, I'm Henry.
- Henry is at Lapell's factory.

32
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,364
Print is your business, ha?
Plumbing is mine.

33
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:52,162
30 years. I've seen has never had changed
for patching to the hell how it is now!

34
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,875
I put every damn pipe
in this neighborhood.

35
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,127
- Dad!
- Bill!

36
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:00,299
Pipes ain't growing alone. I make sure
they don't. Look at my knees.

37
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,890
- Look at my knees!
- Bill!

38
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:09,897
- Are you hungry?
- Bill!

39
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:28,847
The girls had heard this before...

40
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:33,438
but 14 years ago, I had
an operation on my arm here.

41
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:38,654
Doctors said I won't be able to use it.
But what the hell do they know, I said.

42
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:45,121
And I rubbed it for a half hour every day
and I've got those... I could move it a little.

43
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:51,171
And I got... so I could turn a faucet
and pretty soon I had my arm back again.

44
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:55,762
Now I can't feel a damn
thing in it. All numb...

45
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,732
I'm afraid to cut it, you know.

46
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:12,035
Mary usually does the carving but
maybe tonight you'll do it, Henry.

47
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,581
All right with you?

48
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,419
Of course.

49
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,675
I'd be happy to.

50
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:38,935
I just... just cut them up
like regular chickens?

51
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,438
Sure, just cut them up
like regular chickens.

52
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,826
It'll be all right.

53
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:43,579
Excuse me.

54
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:21,114
Well, Henry, what do you know?

55
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:30,706
I don't know much of anything.

56
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:11,578
Henry, may I speak
to you a minute?

57
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,080
Over here.

58
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:03,710
Did you and Mary
have sexual intercourse?

59
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:09,132
- Why?
- Did you?

60
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:14,053
- Why are you asking me this question?
- I have a very good reason.

61
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:17,056
But now I want you to tell me.

62
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,938
I-I'm very... I love Mary.

63
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,526
Henry, I asked you if you
and Mary had sexual intercourse.

64
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,738
- I-I don't think it's any of your business.
- Henry!

65
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:37,909
Sorry.

66
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:43,748
You're in very bad trouble
if you won't cooperate.

67
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:52,506
Well... I...

68
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:59,179
- Mary!
- Mother!

69
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:04,601
- Answer me!
- I'm too nervous.

70
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:08,771
- There's a baby. It's at the hospital.
- Mom!

71
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,941
- And you're the father.
- It isn't possible...

72
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:17,738
- It's still unsure it is a baby.
- It's premature, but there's a baby.

73
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,951
After the two of you are married which should
be very soon, you can pick the baby up.

74
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:40,050
Mom, he's got
his nose bleeding.

75
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:47,140
I'll get ice.

76
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:57,775
Will you mind, Henry,
you and I getting married?

77
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:00,486
No!

78
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:15,083
This dinner is getting cold.

79
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:09,164
Is there any mail?

80
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:14,586
No.

81
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:27,891
Shut up!

82
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,773
Shut up!

83
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:46,506
I can't stand it.
I'm going home.

84
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:55,682
- What are you talking about?
- I can't even sleep. I'm loosing my mind.

85
00:40:56,141 --> 00:41:00,895
You're on vacation, now.
You can take care of it for a night.

86
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:04,023
Will you come back tomorrow?

87
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:07,776
All I need is a decency of that sleep.

88
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:21,748
Why don't you just stay home?

89
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,084
I'll do what I wanna do.

90
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:30,089
And you better take real good
care of things while I'm gone.

91
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:57,991
Oh, you are sick...

92
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,152
Move over.

93
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:41,189
Move over.
Move over!

94
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:53,717
I locked myself
out of my apartment.

95
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:13,110
And it's so late.

96
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:15,252
Where's your wife?

97
00:59:26,304 --> 00:59:30,266
She must've gone
back to her parents, again.

98
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:36,521
I'm not sure.

99
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:34,284
Can I spend a night here?

100
01:02:56,292 --> 01:03:02,547
In heaven everything is fine

101
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:09,428
In heaven everything is fine

102
01:03:09,638 --> 01:03:11,723
In heaven everything is fine

103
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:25,277
You've got your good things
and I've got mine

104
01:03:29,656 --> 01:03:35,703
In heaven everything is fine

105
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:42,376
In heaven everything is fine

106
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:49,466
In heaven everything is fine

107
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:55,930
You've got your good things
and you've got mine

108
01:04:02,812 --> 01:04:15,323
In heaven...
...everything is fine

109
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:20,609
Ok, Paul!

110
01:09:27,908 --> 01:09:31,035
Hi ya sonny,
what've you got there?

111
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,098
Counter, Paul!

112
01:12:14,015 --> 01:12:16,513
It's ok.
