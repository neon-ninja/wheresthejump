00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,715
<i>Who are you angry at?</i>

3
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:01,584
Everyone.

4
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,153
Everything.

5
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:06,455
What do you do
when you get angry?

6
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,691
I pipe up!

7
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,897
Fuck my lungs with smog.

8
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:18,869
Do you have an outlet
to release this anger if you...

9
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,538
- can't get high?
- No.

10
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,507
I want to lash out.

11
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,577
Release this...
this deep fucking hate

12
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:31,114
I have for everyone,
everything!

13
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:33,717
Just to fucking purge

14
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,919
all this shit that eats me up!

15
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,456
"Purge."

16
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,959
Interesting term.

17
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,996
You may have a chance
to purge soon.

18
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,908
<i>Unemployment rising
across the nation.</i>

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,077
<i>Stock market down
another 2,000 points</i>

20
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,013
<i>in the largest drop
in its history.</i>

21
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:04,715
<i>A subprime mortgage
crisis worse than 2008.</i>

22
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,183
<i>Neighborhoods

00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:09,120
<i>destroyed by
an opioid epidemic.</i>

24
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:15,159
<i>Protests across the nation.</i>

25
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:17,028
<i>Americans are looking
for a necessary change</i>

26
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,262
<i>in these tumultuous times.</i>

27
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,563
<i>Citizens
growing angry as they face</i>

28
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:21,900
<i>a collapsing economy.</i>

29
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:23,567
<i>A new party is arising</i>

30
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,771
<i>as a substitute to
the Republicans and Democrats,</i>

31
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:28,639
<i>calling themselves the New
Founding Fathers of America.</i>

32
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,242
<i>The New Founding Fathers</i>

33
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:33,778
<i>rising in polls with
the NRA now endorsing them</i>

34
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,546
<i>and supporting them
financially</i>

35
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,882
<i>with large donations
to the NFFA war chest.</i>

36
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:40,018
<i>Can the NFFA seize control?</i>

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,254
<i>Will Americans fall
for their fear mongering?</i>

38
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:44,223
As your elected president,

39
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,159
with my fellow
New Founding Fathers,

40
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,627
we make this promise.

41
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,930
We will revive this country.

42
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:54,232
The American dream is dead.

43
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:57,569
We will do whatever it takes
to let you dream again.

44
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:58,872
USA! USA!

45
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:25,064
We are now only days from this

46
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,934
controversial experiment,
this night of legalized crime

47
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:30,304
that people are now
calling the Purge.

48
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:32,638
And there are protests
all over.

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,308
Conflict between
anti-Purge protesters

50
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,845
<i>and Purge supporters broke out
early today in North Carolina.</i>

51
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,780
Yes, Susan,
I'm here in Charlotte.

52
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:42,915
There's been about
20 arrests so far,

53
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,584
and we'll keep you informed
as protests

54
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:45,818
<i>are continuing.</i>

55
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:50,190
Staten Island, the chosen site,

56
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:52,993
has become the focus
for the entire world.

57
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:54,762
We have reporters
across the island

58
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:57,698
who will be giving live updates
for the next several days.

59
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,701
Let's go now to correspondent
Van Jones, who's in Park Hill.

60
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:03,303
Yes, James. I'm here
outside the Park Hill Towers,

61
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:06,173
a low-income housing project,
and I can see citizens are...

62
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:07,808
Isaiah, our tower
made the news.

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,944
Are you serious?

64
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,618
Goddamn it.

65
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:30,265
Dolores. Good morning.

66
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,366
Have you seen Tony?

67
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,001
My sink is leaking again.

68
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:34,702
Good morning, sweetie.

69
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,405
I'm so sick of this
piece of shit building.

70
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,807
The damn elevator's
down again, too.

71
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,943
As bad as my asthma is, got me
sweating like a fucking snitch.

72
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:44,779
We need five or six supers
in this raggedy motherfucker.

73
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:47,682
I'll let him know what's up
if I see him.

74
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:49,204
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

75
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:51,352
Hey.

76
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:54,624
This bullshit experiment
really happening, Ny?

77
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,263
- Talk to you later, okay?
- All right, sweetie.

78
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:04,699
The Pope has continued
his condemnation of the Purge.

79
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,136
And France's president,
Lemercier, has called upon...

80
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,771
I'll see you later, bro.
I'm out.

81
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:11,307
- I'll see you tonight.
- A'ight.

82
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:13,808
...if the NFFA
doesn't stop this, quote,

83
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,177
"barbaric experiment."

84
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,447
Locally, protestors
have started to gather

85
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,449
at the evaluation sites,

86
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,284
as well as outside
local government offices.

87
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,985
So far,

88
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,954
there has been no sign
of violence,

89
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,723
but tensions are high
as the clock ticks.

90
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,293
<i>Are you an angry person?</i>

91
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:32,862
Who ain't?

92
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:35,331
Just tell me what I need to do
to get paid.

93
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,969
If you remain on Staten Island
during the experiment,

94
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:43,342
you will receive monetary
compensation of $5,000.

95
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,344
You'll give me $5,000

96
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,248
just to stay home
during this thing?

97
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,417
How would you know if I stayed?

98
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,254
We would implant
a tracking device in your arm.

99
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,888
Not harmful.

100
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,125
And if you decide
to participate beyond that,

101
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,462
there would be
further compensation.

102
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,265
What do you mean,
"participate"?

103
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,370
Go out, release your anger.

104
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,471
You mean kill someone?

105
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,774
If you feel compelled.

106
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,312
Okay. Let's do this.

107
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,783
I need the money.

108
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,785
<i>Let's go to our News Four</i>

109
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,154
<i>on-the-scene reporter
at the Park Hill Towers.</i>

110
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,290
<i>This is one of a dozen sites</i>

111
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:36,227
<i>being set up across the island
where citizens are signing up</i>

112
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,930
<i>to participate
in the experiment.</i>

113
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,533
They are also being
psychologically evaluated here

114
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,136
to determine
their mental status

115
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,938
<i>before they purge.</i>

116
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,373
<i>And they will be
evaluated again</i>

117
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,310
<i>after the experiment,
if they survive,</i>

118
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,878
<i>to see how they
were affected by the night</i>

119
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,151
<i>that is being described
as a "societal catharsis."</i>

120
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,784
Are you angry?

121
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,420
Damn straight.

122
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,390
People around here been making
fun of us our whole lives.

123
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:07,092
We keep to ourselves, but they
just won't leave us alone.

124
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,995
Are you ever inclined
to hurt someone?

125
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,031
What do you think, Doc?

126
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,200
The island was chosen
because its demographic

127
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,835
is a perfect representation...

128
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,342
<i>There are numerous</i>

129
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:25,811
<i>drug and street gangs
on Staten Island.</i>

130
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,547
<i>Many are wondering
if they'll participate.</i>

131
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:29,549
<i>Many citizens are leaving.</i>

132
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:32,018
<i>For those staying,
the financial reward</i>

133
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,353
<i>seems to be the incentive.</i>

134
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:34,820
Despite the weather conditions,

135
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,322
the protesters are out.

136
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,524
They have their signs,
and their fists are raised.

137
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:41,827
They are against the Purge
experiment that is happening.

138
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,096
This is wrong!

139
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:44,863
Do not purge! Do not purge!

140
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,499
Walk away from their money!

141
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,901
Do not purge!

142
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:51,137
Do not participate!
Do not purge!

143
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,872
Do not participate!

144
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,608
<i>So we are here
with Arlo Sabian.</i>

145
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,277
<i>He is the chief of staff
for the NFFA.</i>

146
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,513
<i>He got this whole thing
pushed through Congress.</i>

147
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:02,148
Well, you got protests
all over the place now.

148
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,417
Please. The idea of the Purge
was analyzed for years.

149
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,953
We allowed island citizens
to vote on participation.

150
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:09,122
- They voted yes.
- Yeah, and you know why?

151
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:11,458
Because a lot of those people
felt coerced by the fact

152
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,260
they don't have money
and you're offering money.

153
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:15,195
So, what do you say
to the lower-income people

154
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,930
who are out here
risking their lives tonight?

155
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:18,599
Well, Van, as with
any scientific trial,

156
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:20,367
those who participate
receive payment.

157
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,269
You know, I'm gonna turn
to you, Dr. Updale.

158
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,937
You are the behavioral
scientist

159
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,240
who actually came up
with this whole experiment.

160
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:29,143
A lot of people have
a lot of concerns about this,

161
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,211
and one concern comes up
over and over again.

162
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:32,480
I want the truth from you.

163
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:35,583
Is the Purge
a political device?

164
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:37,885
I do not work for the NFFA.

165
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,055
I did not conceive
of the experiment for them.

166
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:43,291
The NFFA had the courage
to test it,

167
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:45,527
but the conceit
is not a political one.

168
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,529
It is a psychological one.

169
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:50,998
The benefit of acting violently
without worry of consequence,

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,300
- that's a freeing violence.
- "A freeing violence."

171
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,637
Okay, that's a...
that's a new one on me.

172
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,037
I have a question for you.

173
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,006
What is your definition
of success?

174
00:08:58,008 --> 00:08:59,908
Well, the level
of participation

175
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,209
in certain areas is key.

176
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,044
Uh, the Park Hill Towers,
for example,

177
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,380
are the center
of this community.

178
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:06,981
If there's considerable
participation there,

179
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,350
I think that'll be
a strong indication

180
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,018
that this night
is a great success.

181
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,187
- Well, we'll see.
- They have monetized

182
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:15,157
- and incentivized murder.
- Yeah!

183
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,060
- Walk away from their money!
- Yeah!

184
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,262
The wealthy areas
are already clearing,

185
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:24,065
but the NFFA knew that we,
"the impoverished,"

186
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,568
would stay if there
was monetary gain.

187
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:28,371
This is another way

188
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:31,139
to keep the brown
and black people down!

189
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,508
Yes!

190
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:38,047
Do not purge!

191
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:40,983
Do not participate!
Do not purge!

192
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:42,486
Do not participate!

193
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,253
Do not purge!

194
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,055
Look at all of this.

195
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:47,724
Everybody want to be
a gangster.

196
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,726
You really think
these regular folk

197
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,261
gonna pop each other like
gangsters when the time comes?

198
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:54,063
Shit yeah. People pissed.

199
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:56,098
They ain't got no money.
They ain't got no food.

200
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,234
- They gotta release their anger.
- Bullshit.

201
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:00,404
They participate,
it'll be for that paper.

202
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:02,005
- Trust me.
- Nah.

203
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:04,074
People gonna riot.

204
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:06,109
They gonna steal,
act like clowns and all that,

205
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,245
but there ain't gonna be
that much killing.

206
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:10,046
Nah, killing comes
from the heart, B.

207
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,482
- Yeah.
- A damaged heart.

208
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:14,418
These people, they don't got
that type of damage.

209
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,753
Do not participate!
Do not purge!

210
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:19,222
- Believe me.
- Do not participate!

211
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,259
Do not purge!
Do not participate!

212
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:23,160
- Do not purge!
- D!

213
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:25,228
You come to see the show?

214
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,397
OG.

215
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,699
All three of you old men
out today?

216
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,400
What's the occasion? Am I...

217
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:32,202
Am I the luckiest man
in the world?

218
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,704
Three kings at your service.

219
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:35,540
Nah, we the Three Wise Men.

220
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,073
Man, who are you fuckers
kidding?

221
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:39,109
We the Three Stooges
on our best day.

222
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,778
Moe, Larry, Jheri curl.

223
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,685
What you think
about all this here, Fred?

224
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,454
Oh, man.

225
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,189
Look here.

226
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,658
This is the greatest shit show
on Earth.

227
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,360
They turning our island
into ancient Rome.

228
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:58,729
Our hood into the Colosseum.
Now, the question is:

229
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:01,365
Are we gonna be the Christians
or the lions?

230
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,601
Gladiators or the slaves,
right?

231
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,339
Stay safe, Three.

232
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,208
If you need anything...

233
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,442
We three okay, man.

234
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,744
We done seen it all
and then some.

235
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:15,380
We three, we've been
through some shit.

236
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,183
Y'all be easy.

237
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,753
Hey, tough guy.

238
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:23,789
You here to participate
or protest?

239
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,425
Still fighting
the good fight, woman?

240
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:28,193
Fighting the only fight.

241
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,762
Oh, I see.

242
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:32,231
No cops, no law.

243
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,400
Sounds like a dream come true
for a man in your business.

244
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,135
You got me wrong
on this one, Ny.

245
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:38,337
I don't like it.

246
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,738
Why not?

247
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,640
I don't know what it is.

248
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:43,544
When I don't know
exactly what something is...

249
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:45,746
I don't trust it.

250
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,184
Not one bit.

251
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,633
Keep it moving, man.

252
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,568
Hey, yo, pocket that money
quick, son.

253
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,450
And then send these niggas
on their way, a'ight?

254
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,774
Man, listen.

255
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:17,110
We one of Dmitri's top corners
'cause we keep shit moving.

256
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,378
A'ight.

257
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,713
Let's go, man.

258
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,216
Isaiah.

259
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:24,754
Your sister know you here?

260
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:28,824
You're better than this, son.

261
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,665
Come by the shop,
you want a job.

262
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,338
The fuck you doing, man?

263
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,173
You got a customer.

264
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,374
The customer.

265
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:48,509
The-the one and only.

266
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,545
What you need, Skeletor?

267
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:53,682
Mmm, yeah, I smell your sweat.

268
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,350
Innocent Isaiah just...

269
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,251
fresh-fresh.

270
00:12:57,253 --> 00:12:58,587
What the fuck
you talking about, nigga?

271
00:12:58,589 --> 00:12:59,854
Ah, you green.

272
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,389
Our first transaction's
on you, hmm?

273
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:05,660
A little initiation fee
to get my biz

274
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:07,862
with your fine-ass sister.

275
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:10,665
Hey, yo, fuck you, fiend.
Move on.

276
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,803
Get the fuck out
of my face, man.

277
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:18,440
A blood baptism for Innocent I.

278
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:19,909
Sure enough.

279
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:22,510
See, that's what
the doctor ordered.

280
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:26,681
And I'm the practicing
practitioner!

281
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,153
Yo, hold up, hold up.

282
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:34,222
Yo, yo! Yo, we out!

283
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:36,224
Hey, yo, clear out, yo!

284
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:37,727
Hey, yo, come on, Isaiah.
Come on.

285
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:38,961
- Come on.
- He cut me, man.

286
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:41,564
For real?

287
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:44,734
I called y'all here
to discuss this experiment.

288
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,403
I don't give a shit what other
people do during Purge night.

289
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:49,639
I care about what you all do.

290
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:53,509
You get hurt or you die,
I lose money.

291
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,978
- And I don't lose money.
- Word. Word.

292
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,682
- And we got enemies, right?
- Yeah, true.

293
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,917
Niggas might use the night
to make a move on us.

294
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,519
Maybe the police
might use the night

295
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,921
to take out motherfuckers
like us.

296
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:06,522
Who knows?

297
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:09,625
Point is, we gotta
be prepared for anything.

298
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,794
So we lay low.

299
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:14,263
We stay inside, and we protect

300
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,966
- what needs protecting.
- Word. - That's what's up.

301
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,669
Our kin, our skin,

302
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:22,839
our product and our money.

303
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,641
Yo, D. We should all
just go to Brooklyn.

304
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:26,610
You know what I mean?
So we don't even take a chance.

305
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:29,413
Nah.
Nah, we can't move our money

306
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,381
or our stash off the island.
It's too risky.

307
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:34,951
- And it'll make us look weak.
- Come on, my G.

308
00:14:34,953 --> 00:14:37,988
This is bullshit.
I want to fucking purge, man.

309
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,424
I want to tear shit up
and have some fucking fun.

310
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:41,958
For the first time in my life,

311
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,393
I could be
a law-abiding citizen.

312
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:50,600
Oh!

313
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:00,011
If you so much as blink,

314
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:03,847
Blaise will remove the skin
from your face, fat man.

315
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,683
She does exactly what I say.

316
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:07,287
You know why?

317
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:09,987
We're family.

318
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,823
I put food on her table,

319
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:13,791
and I put money in her pocket.

320
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,394
My only question for you is:

321
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,463
I put food on your table.

322
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,565
Why don't I get the same type
of discipline

323
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,999
from your big ass?

324
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:24,001
My bad, D.

325
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:25,706
I'll stay home.

326
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:30,309
Good boy.

327
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,613
Let's get through
this Purge bullshit

328
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:37,015
so we can get back
to business as usual.

329
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,488
D.

330
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,590
There's been an incident.

331
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:48,795
Isaiah, man.

332
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:51,697
What you thinking?

333
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,968
Isaiah, you home?

334
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,971
Yeah. I'm just showering, sis.

335
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:00,439
Did you hear what happened
at Fourth and...

336
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,075
Isaiah, what's going on?

337
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:03,776
Why's there blood on the floor?
Are you good?

338
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:05,811
Yeah, I-I cut myself shaving.

339
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,713
You need facial hair
in order to shave, boy.

340
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,649
Open up the door,
or I'll kick it in.

341
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,520
You know I will.

342
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:13,622
A'ight.

343
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,590
Jesus Christ,
what happened to your neck?

344
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,426
Keep your left up.

345
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:22,931
Jab, jab, jab.

346
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,566
Get it out, get it out!

347
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,867
There you go.

348
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:29,468
Hey, hey!

349
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,670
It's all locked and loaded.

350
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:32,139
We're gonna have
at least 20 soldiers

351
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,707
surrounding this place,

352
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,642
keeping it secure
during the experiment.

353
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,677
Me and Blaise
will be at the stash house

354
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,546
with about two dozen niggas
on the perimeter.

355
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:40,615
We'll be protected.

356
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:45,587
Oh!

357
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:48,989
The eyes, Terence!

358
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,456
The eyes, the eyes.

359
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,059
Your eyes went right to Aesop.

360
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,061
Now, me, you, everybody know
you tossing to Sop.

361
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:56,697
You ain't talking, but you
telling me everything, man.

362
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:57,932
Let's pay attention to that.

363
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,099
Everything else
is good money, a'ight?

364
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,401
Let's keep up the pace,
a'ight, boys?

365
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:01,303
Whoa, what are you doing?

366
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:02,304
- Thanks, D. Appreciate it.
- Of course.

367
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,071
- Run it from the top.
- Let me through!

368
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,407
Let me through!
Get your hands off of me!

369
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:07,775
- Don't touch me.
- Yo.

370
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,543
Put your hands on me
one more time,

371
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,145
I'll rip your fucking
balls off. Believe that.

372
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,147
Ooh.

373
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:14,816
To what do I owe this...

374
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,654
Cut the shit.
I need to talk to you now.

375
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,422
My office.

376
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:38,440
You son of a...

377
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,009
- Yo, yo, yo.
- I don't believe you.

378
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,110
What is it? What's up?

379
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:42,444
Isaiah was just cut

380
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:44,613
by some junkie
off one of your corners.

381
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:47,216
- What? Is he all right?
- He's going to be fine.

382
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:48,850
He didn't want to go
to the hospital,

383
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,752
'cause he was too afraid
I was going to find out

384
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,053
he's been hooking school,

385
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,588
working the corner
for the past week.

386
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,123
I had no idea
he was involved, Nya.

387
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,524
- Oh, bullshit.
- You think I know

388
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:58,661
who works my corners?
Nya, come on. Nya.

389
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:01,731
I would never let Isaiah get
anywhere close to the business.

390
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,798
You know that.

391
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,836
I watched that boy grow up.

392
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:08,470
Why'd he... why'd he do it?

393
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:09,571
Why else?

394
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,007
He's sick of struggling.

395
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:12,742
He wanted to make life
a little bit easier for us

396
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:14,143
- with some extra cash.
- And I told you I would

397
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,710
- give you money for that.
- Stop.

398
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,646
I'll never take
your blood money.

399
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:18,715
You know that.

400
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,084
I-I tried talking to him.

401
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:23,053
I tried...
I tried being his mother,

402
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,521
his father, his brother,
his sister, but clearly,

403
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,090
- I'm not doing a good enough job.
- Nya, Nya, hey.

404
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:28,724
- Clearly, I can be...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

405
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,828
It's a'ight. I got you.

406
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:36,168
I want you to stay with me
during the Purge, a'ight?

407
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,171
You and Isaiah.

408
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,173
As far as that...

409
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,709
as far as that fiend
who hurt your brother, I'm-a...

410
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:47,746
I'm-a take care of that,
a'ight?

411
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,717
Take care of it?

412
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,985
Yeah.

413
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:56,586
What you gonna do?

414
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,689
- You gonna hurt him, kill him?
- Ny, come on.

415
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:01,758
No, no, no, no. 'Cause that's
your answer to everything.

416
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,030
Right? That's who you are.

417
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,765
Today, it was two people
we know,

418
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,133
but every day,
it's at least two

419
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:12,038
who are hurt 'cause of you, D.

420
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,604
I know no other way.

421
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:15,706
Come on.

422
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,075
I grew up here, too.

423
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,110
We all have to make
choices in life

424
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:22,679
to heal or to hurt,
and you chose the latter.

425
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,248
Don't you care

426
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,584
about this Purge or what it
could do to our community?

427
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:28,820
I mean...

428
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,689
More selfish bullshit.

429
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,259
Wow.

430
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,031
Now, the Purge is one day.

431
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:43,668
You, Dmitri,

432
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,107
destroy this community
364 days a year.

433
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,246
You weren't always like this.

434
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:56,749
The man I knew and loved
years ago

435
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,785
had courage and had soul.

436
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,124
I miss that man.

437
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,762
But thank you for the invite.

438
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:11,031
I, uh, uh...

439
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,232
We're gonna be fine
without you.

440
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:13,234
- Oh.
- Uh, um...

441
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:16,737
Stay the fuck away from us,
Dmitri.

442
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:31,684
<i>And you're angry.</i>

443
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:32,852
Yes.

444
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:34,154
I'm angry.

445
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:35,822
Very angry.

446
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:37,225
You want to release that anger?

447
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:41,261
I need to.

448
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:44,397
Thank you for
your honest answers.

449
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:46,600
First, a few formalities.

450
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:51,871
Baptisias, the official flower
of the experiment.

451
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:53,873
They represent rebirth.

452
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,675
In the box,
you have recording lenses.

453
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:57,144
Contacts.

454
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,779
Should you choose
to actively participate,

455
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,215
wear them on the evening,

456
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,784
and they'll document
everything you do.

457
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:06,187
As I said,
greater participation

458
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:08,322
yields greater
financial compensation.

459
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:11,392
Next, we'll implant
a tracking device.

460
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:15,129
After that, you'll be all set,
as they say...

461
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,066
to purge.

462
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,181
What do you mean,
I can't get off?

463
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,850
No, let me through!

464
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:37,252
Turn around. You gotta get out.

465
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,321
- No.
- Let me off this island!

466
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:57,037
A lot of people you know
are gonna be there, okay?

467
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,707
Why can't we just stay home?

468
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,775
Selina, because we can't, okay?

469
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,478
This is the safest place
in the neighborhood.

470
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,113
- I'm scared.
- I'm gonna take care of you.

471
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,948
I won't let anything happen,
okay, <i>mamita?</i>

472
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,049
Okay.

473
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:09,918
Hey.

474
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,454
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.

475
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,757
<i>Venga, ven.</i>
Let's hurry up.

476
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,232
- Hey.
- Hey.

477
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,500
Luisa, Selina.

478
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:26,502
Hey. Oh, I didn't expect
to see you.

479
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:29,071
I thought you would have left
the island by now.

480
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:31,407
Oh, I was going to,
but, you know, the money, Nya.

481
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:32,741
$5,000 to stay?

482
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,243
That's life-changing for us.

483
00:22:34,245 --> 00:22:35,810
- We need it.
- Yeah.

484
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,147
Pastor Almory opened up
the church to everyone.

485
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,814
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay? We got cots.

486
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,252
There's gonna be security
at the door, food.

487
00:22:42,254 --> 00:22:45,054
And Pastor's going to deliver
a sermon later tonight.

488
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,789
Oh, Lord, forgive me.

489
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,057
Pastor's a wonderful man,

490
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,026
but his sermons
bore me to death.

491
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:51,528
It's a goddamn
snooze fest, okay?

492
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,763
Yeah.

493
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:55,131
Why don't you make
yourselves at home?

494
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,433
- Anything you need.
- You'll be all right.

495
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:57,967
Thank you for coming.

496
00:22:57,969 --> 00:22:59,268
Thank you so much.

497
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,369
Thank you for coming.

498
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:02,772
Of course. I appreciate it.

499
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,107
Hey, y'all doing good?

500
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:06,076
We gonna be all right.

501
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:13,850
Sis.

502
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,152
Are you there yet?

503
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,520
I'm-I'm already
in Brooklyn, sis.

504
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,822
A block away from Uncle...
Uncle T's place.

505
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:21,258
Um, I-I got the last bus
off the island.

506
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,427
Yeah, I wish you were with me.

507
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:24,995
I know. I know.

508
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:26,965
But I just had to get
as many people

509
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:29,033
off the street
and into the church as I could.

510
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:30,101
Stay safe.

511
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:31,302
I'll be fine.

512
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:32,905
A'ight.

513
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,115
What you say, Skeletor?

514
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:05,198
There are candlelight vigils

515
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,067
happening all over the country.

516
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:10,036
Now let's go to Anne with
footage from just moments ago.

517
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,239
That is the last of the buses
leaving the island.

518
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:16,243
The last ferry
left minutes ago.

519
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:18,011
We're just minutes away now,

520
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,547
and the questions
on everyone's mind

521
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:21,384
<i>remain the same.</i>

522
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,452
Will people participate?

523
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:26,219
Will Staten Islanders prove

524
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:28,456
that this is a night
America needs?

525
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,524
Thanks, Anne.
And now we're going

526
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:32,292
to take you live
to the White House,

527
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:33,993
where President Bracken
will address

528
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:36,464
the citizens of Staten Island
and the nation

529
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:39,701
for the start
of the first experiment.

530
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:43,371
The courageous citizens
of Staten Island...

531
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:46,340
those pioneers...
will be part of something

532
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:49,011
that could bring about
great change.

533
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:53,149
We are all
Staten Islanders tonight.

534
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,517
Good luck.

535
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,526
<i>This is not a test.</i>

536
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:05,960
<i>This is your
Emergency Broadcast System,</i>

537
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:10,232
<i>announcing the commencement
of the NFFA Social Experiment</i>

538
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:12,367
<i>on Staten Island, New York.</i>

539
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,969
<i>Weapons of class four and lower</i>

540
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:18,172

541
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:20,476
<i>All crime, including murder,</i>

542
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,546
<i>will be legal

543
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,081
<i>Blessed be
our New Founding Fathers</i>

544
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,483
<i>and America, a nation reborn.</i>

545

<i>May God be with you all.</i>

546
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,360
For our country.

547
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:04,410
Skeletor's purge is on.

548
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:11,750
Motherfucker.

549
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,419
Tonight's my night, baby.

550
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:15,388
You been charging me money
to take out my money?

551
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,857
Fuck that.
I want my fucking money back.

552
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:21,328
20s, 50s, 100s
or whatever this shit is,

553
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,266
I want that shit right back.

554
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:32,472
You see me, NFFA?

555
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:34,474
Is this the first of the night?

556
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:35,477
Number one.

557
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:40,781
Making my money.

558
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,922
- Shit going down tonight, boys.
- Yeah.

559
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:49,556
We gonna purge.

560
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,224
Gonna have some fun.

561
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:53,426
It's Christmas in March,
niggas.

562
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:54,694
I got my list. Y'all got yours?

563
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:56,329
- Yeah!
- Hey, yo, from tonight on,

564
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:57,430
no more bullshit.

565
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:58,967
From nobody.

566
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:01,502
No one, no thing.

567
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:03,404
From now on, just our shit.

568
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:06,440
Fuck Dmitri!
This is my kingdom.

569
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:07,875
It's our night, fellas.
Y'all ready to run down?

570
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,910
- Hell yeah!
- Let's go then, niggas.

571
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:12,346
And just back
from Staten Island

572
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:13,848
and joining me here
in the studio is Anne.

573
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,449
Anne, what was the atmosphere
like out there?

574
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:16,751
Uh, well, you know, it...

575
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:19,220
People were...
they wanted to see

576
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:20,455
if this could work.

577
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:21,823
This violence
fighting violence.

578
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:23,558
I spoke to both
the anti-Purge protesters

579
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,993
and the Purge supporters...

580
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,695
Dr. Updale?

581
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:28,632
We have something.

582
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:36,339
We believe that this is
the first purge of the evening.

583
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:48,784
Okay.

584
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:49,986
Get it out there.

585
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,520
Yes, sir.

586
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,602
Yo.

587
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:41,504
Zo. How we doing?

588
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:43,006
Quiet, quiet.

589
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:45,308
Locked down, all good.

590
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,777
Oh, oh, one thing.

591
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,779
Fat-ass Cap A didn't show up
to work today.

592
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,415
Bet you this motherfucker
out there purging.

593
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,883
What else?

594
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:56,620
If you need company,
we got the girls on the way.

595
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:59,556
- I'm not interested.
- Yeah, well,

596
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:01,925
you should keep 'em around
just in case you get bored.

597
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:04,029
Call me if you need
anything else, bro.

598
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:16,574
I ask you, do we descend?

599
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:20,477
On this dreaded night,
do we descend?

600
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,982
Or do we ascend?

601
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:27,886
That is the question
that we all must ask ourselves.

602
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:30,355
The 23rd psalm says,

603
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:32,124
"Although I walk
through the valley

604
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:34,026
- in the shadow of death..."
- Check this out.

605
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:36,928
I found Pastor's
secret stash in his office.

606
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,531
- He's got a whole bar up there.
- Are you kidding me?

607
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:40,965
Thank the Lord.

608
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,834
Monopoly is not gonna get me
through this night.

609
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,702
Oh. He gonna see you.

610
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:46,704
- Mm-hmm.
- ...no man but God.

611
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,042
It tastes like old-man ass.

612
00:32:51,044 --> 00:32:53,579
Don't ask me how I know.

613
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:55,047
You sure you don't want a swig?

614
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,649
No, thank you, Dolores.

615
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:58,484
Okay. Gonna be a long night.

616
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:00,085
Every dark night,

617
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:03,122
the sun shall rise
in the morning.

618
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,019
Tonight, young blood.

619
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,058
Get the fuck out of here.

620
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:13,829
The fuck you looking at?

621
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:29,644
You see me kill
that motherfucker, boy?

622
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:31,646
Tough guy.

623
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:33,814
What you think
you're gonna do with that?

624
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:36,083
- Stand down, motherfucker.
- Yo!

625
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:38,486
I'm exercising my right to
purge by taking all your merch.

626
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:41,823
And if you stand in my way,
I will fuck you up!

627
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:44,126
Motherfucker.

628
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:46,527
- Let's fucking purge, y'all!
- Yeah!

629
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:48,196
I'm coming for my free shit.

630
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,288
- Get back, get back, man!
- Hey, you get back, nigga!

631
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:56,038
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chill, chill.

632
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,172
Fall back. Yo, Isaiah.

633
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:59,740
Chill. It's me, Kels.

634
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:02,144
Damn, K. Scared the shit
out of me, son.

635
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:03,779
Man, what the hell you doing

636
00:35:03,781 --> 00:35:05,714
out here by yourself, yeah?

637
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:07,250
And why you wearing
those contacts?

638
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:08,984
What, you purging,
little nigga?

639
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:13,089
Oh, I see. You out here looking
for Skeletor, ain't you?

640
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:14,856
Motherfucker made you look
like a little bitch.

641
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:17,226
Now you trying
to save some face.

642
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,027
Man, screw that shit, yo.

643
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,529
Roll with us.

644
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:21,930
There's a Purge party
down the block.

645
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:23,632
What the hell is a Purge party,
my nigga?

646
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:25,034
Nigga, I don't know.
Could be fun, though.

647
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:26,569
Let's go find out.

648
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:28,039
Maybe your boy
Skeletor's there.

649
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,142
Let's go, y'all. We out.

650
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,977
There's nothing happening.

651
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,213
Look at this.

652
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,648
Some kind of block party.

653
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,818
There are actually a couple
across the island.

654
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,654
Parties?

655
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:49,561
Are you kidding me?

656
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:40,879
<i>CNB breaking news
from Staten Island.</i>

657
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:43,081
This footage just came in.

658
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,350
It's being reported
as the first kill

659
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:48,086
or purge of the evening.

660
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:51,089
The following is graphic
and contains violent images

661
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:52,924
- that might not be suitable for minors.
- Selina.

662
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:54,293
Hey, come with me.

663
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,096
Help me with the other kids.

664
00:36:57,697 --> 00:36:58,930
There's something wrong

665
00:36:58,932 --> 00:37:01,068
with the world,
isn't there, Nya?

666
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,338
There is something wrong,
Selina.

667
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,875
But we have to keep trying
to fix it.

668
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:17,917
Please, Jesus...

669
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,051
<i>This is very disturbing,</i>

670
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:21,153
<i>but it is what we expected
to see tonight.</i>

671
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,823
<i>It is very hard
to process that...</i>

672
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,325
<i>what we are looking at here
is actually legal,</i>

673
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,694
<i>that there is no punishment
for this inhumane act.</i>

674
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:32,198
<i>This is almost
an alternate reality.</i>

675
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:37,404
Hi. I'm good.

676
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:39,139
Have you seen it?

677
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:40,273
No, what is it?

678
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,807
You're a freak!

679
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:45,077
- What is it?
- Oh, shit, you see this?

680
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,113
Yo, what's up?

681
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,319
Yo, you looking at this, bro?

682
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:53,853
Holy shit.

Hey, yo, Zay.

00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,356
Check this out, bro.

685
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,958
It's the first kill

686
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,359
20 million views already.

00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,027
Damn, that's some
animal shit, man.

688
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,396
That's some nasty shit, yo.

689
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:04,931
But I'm out.
I'm-a go find that psycho.

690
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:07,067
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
Careful, son.

691
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:08,370
That motherfucker crazy.

692
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,138
- Yeah.
- Y'all see that?

693
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:17,878
Yeah, your queens ready
to party with the king.

694
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,180
Fuck, hey!

695
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:21,382
Whoo!

696
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,450
- Ay!
- Yeah!

697
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:23,484
Yo.

698
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:25,955

699
00:38:27,157 --> 00:38:28,922
Call me if you need anything.

700

- All right, cool.
- A'ight?

Good luck, Seven.

702
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,496
Make yourselves at home.

703
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:37,998
You already know
where the bar is.

704

Hey, yo,
any y'all seen Skeletor?

705
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,326
- Can't wait, baby.
- Whoo!

706
00:39:37,328 --> 00:39:38,461
Y'all getting it poppin'.

707
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,432
So, what's this?
You're matching and shit?

708
00:39:43,434 --> 00:39:44,433
Yes.

709
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:46,135
- What up, daddy?
- Oh.

710
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:47,804
What's up?

711
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:53,476
Oh, he's ready.

712
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:57,480
Oh...

713
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,277
Look how sexy she is.

714
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,414
You like what you see?

715
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:32,082
- You want me?
- So hot.

716
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:33,851
Mmm.

717
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,111
Mmm, Zaddy.

718
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,443
Founding Fathers...

719
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:05,311
pay me!

720
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,615
Save me!

721
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:14,762
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

722
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:19,326
Who and how much?

723
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,161
Capital A.

724
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,698
A lot.
More money than we'd see

725
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,999
in ten lifetimes
doing the shit we do.

726
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,401
Wasn't personal, D.

727
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:29,469
It was our way out.

728
00:42:34,276 --> 00:42:36,243
Purging.

729
00:42:36,245 --> 00:42:37,477
Cherry.

730
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:41,182
Cherry, they watching.

731
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,550
Make that money.

732
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:45,586
Soil that soul, Innocent I!

733
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:56,163
Where you gonna run to, Isaiah?

734
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:58,131
You can't run from me.

735
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,200
I'm the night, Isaiah.

736
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,439
I'm gonna find you.

737
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:06,274
It's starting.

738
00:43:06,276 --> 00:43:09,243
The basic tenets of morality
have to be abandoned.

739
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:11,512
Religious dogma
must be dropped.

740
00:43:11,514 --> 00:43:14,783
People are beginning
to participate.

741
00:43:14,785 --> 00:43:17,452
Don't get too excited.

742
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:19,287
And to this point, we've seen

743
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:22,490
mostly looting and vandalism,
with only a few instances

744
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:24,159
of real violence
across the island.

745
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:26,295
Take, for example,
the Park Hill Towers,

746
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:27,796
the center of the community.

747
00:43:27,798 --> 00:43:30,165
Many people are looking at them

748
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,434
as a gauge
of the Purge's success,

749
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:35,139
but so far,
it's been relatively quiet.

750
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:39,577
Where you gonna go?

751
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:43,046
I'm everywhere, Isaiah!

752
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,217
You can't hide from me!

753
00:43:53,658 --> 00:43:55,459
I see you!

754
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:12,075
- You hear that?
- Get that motherfucker!

755
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,181
I told you, he's over there!

756
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:19,551
Yo, this way.

757
00:44:56,722 --> 00:44:59,058
Yo, over here.

758
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:02,228
We gonna get you,
motherfucker!

759
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:06,830
- I think he left.
- Nah.

760
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:08,666
Let's check out back.

761
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:16,775
Where you hiding, boy?

762
00:45:16,777 --> 00:45:18,677
We know you're here.

763
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:22,282
Mother...

764
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:25,617
Hey. Just calling to check in.

765
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:27,485
How's Brooklyn? How's Uncle T?

766
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:29,921
Nya, I'm not in Brooklyn.

767
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:31,756
What?

768
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:33,459
Where are you?

769
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,463
Okay, uh, I'm on my way.

770
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,440
That motherfucker tried us, D.

771
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:50,811
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.

772
00:46:28,483 --> 00:46:30,416
No, no, no, no, no, no!

773
00:46:31,386 --> 00:46:34,453
Get the fuck off of me!
What are you doing?

774
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,992
Let go of me!

775
00:46:38,994 --> 00:46:40,794
What the fuck? Get the...

776
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:43,797
Get your fucking hands
off of me!

777
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:44,799
No!

778
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:55,544
Pussy-grabbing motherfucker!

779
00:46:57,246 --> 00:46:59,346
I told you, he's over there!

780
00:46:59,348 --> 00:47:00,616
Come on!

781
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,243
This way.

782
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,248
Where you at?

783
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:40,354
Yo, over here!

784
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:41,691
I think he went upstairs!

785
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,619
Brother and sister.

786
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,089
- What the...?
- Where's your brother, hmm?

787
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,091
Fuck them!

788
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:16,458
And I don't want to wait.

789
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,659
Can't wait.

790
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,428
No more.
See, I gotta get paid!

791
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,398
No more!

792
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,802
Fuck!

793
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,636
Motherfucker!

794
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,122
Oh, shit.

795
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:48,357
My girls.

796
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,994
I didn't think y'all
was gonna pull it off.

797
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:52,863
I am impressed.

798
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:55,666
I'm the king now.

799
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:57,603
And y'all are my queen.

800
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:00,738
So tell me,

801
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,606
that bitch-ass nigga
beg for his life?

802
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:12,986
Young king!

803
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:16,487
Your time is up now, A.

804
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,688
It was short.

805
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,557
Hope the crown felt good.

806
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:20,991
Yo, yo, D.

807
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:23,128
You thought
that you could use their purge

808
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,896
to take my ass out, but...

809
00:49:25,898 --> 00:49:27,765
Didn't anybody tell you, A?

810
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:30,734
I don't know how to die.

811
00:49:30,736 --> 00:49:34,440
You can't purge me, man.
I purge you.

812
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,511
In plain sight.

813
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:40,712
Yo, D.

814
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:42,446
Later, A.

815
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:43,982
Fuck you!

816
00:49:49,422 --> 00:49:51,024
Take care of these fools, man.

817
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,494
And let the girls walk.

818
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,463
But make sure that they know

819
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:00,834
never to step foot
on this island again.

820
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:19,585
How accurate are these figures?

821
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:21,053
They were just updated, sir.

822
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,156
You predicted a much higher
level of participation.

823
00:50:24,158 --> 00:50:26,158
We should have
expected the unexpected.

824
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,693
This is an experiment.

825
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,161
There are variables.

826
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:31,063
- Variables?
- Human nature.

827
00:50:31,065 --> 00:50:33,933
Behavioral patterns vary
according to environment.

828
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:35,801
Data suggests
that this socioeconomic group

829
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:38,804
is not reacting the way
that I predicted.

830
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:40,040
Question is: Why?

831
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:42,608
I don't give a shit why.

832
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,610
The NFFA put a lot of faith
into this evening.

833
00:50:44,612 --> 00:50:45,946
If it's deemed ineffective,
the entire regime

834
00:50:45,948 --> 00:50:48,181
could be judged as a failure.

835
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:49,950
I told you that science

836
00:50:49,952 --> 00:50:51,885
does not obey the laws
of politics.

837
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:54,922
My job is to analyze this data,
nothing more.

838
00:50:54,924 --> 00:50:56,489
Excuse me.

839
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:58,658
I have to take this.

840
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,826
Yes, sir.

841
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:04,134
Yes, sir, we're looking
at the data right now.

842
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:06,867
We've gotta get to the church.

843
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:08,470
We'll be safe there.

844
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:14,576
So?

845
00:51:15,644 --> 00:51:17,144
What?

846
00:51:17,146 --> 00:51:18,845
You lied to me, Isaiah.

847
00:51:19,915 --> 00:51:21,181
Almost got yourself killed.

848
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:23,617
Oh, are we gonna talk or what?

849
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,186
What do you want me to say?

850
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:26,988
That I'm wrong and I'm sorry?

851
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,023
That I learned
my lesson tonight?

852
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:30,792
Or that I was just being
plain-ass stupid?

853
00:51:30,794 --> 00:51:33,061
Yeah, that's what
I want you to say.

854
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:34,731
I just said it.

855
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:38,732
I fucking hate
our apartment, Nya.

856
00:51:38,734 --> 00:51:40,734
The leaks, roaches.

857
00:51:40,736 --> 00:51:43,037
The fact that we never
have anything for anything.

858
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:45,139
I don't like it, either,
but there are other ways.

859
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:46,574
Are there?

860
00:51:46,576 --> 00:51:48,077
'Cause I ain't seeing 'em.

861
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,844
I ain't seeing a way out, Nya.

862
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:57,087
When I was with Dmitri,
I saw a lot of stupid shit.

863
00:51:58,555 --> 00:51:59,821
People getting hooked.

864
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:02,223
Friends getting locked up.

865
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:04,025
I've been down this road
before,

866
00:52:04,027 --> 00:52:05,226
and I saw a way out.

867
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:06,896
Just let me help you
see it, too.

868
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,568
Deal?

869
00:52:11,669 --> 00:52:12,837
Deal.

870
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:17,039
Hey, yo, hey.

871
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:19,975
Come on, man.
We-we don't want no problem.

872
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:22,577
- Shut up!
- Okay.

873
00:52:25,682 --> 00:52:27,016
Don't...

874
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,252
Hey, that's my sister.

875
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:36,692
- No. No, no, no, no.
- No, no.

876
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:39,928
Please. Please, no, no, no.

877
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,565
No, no, don't. Please.

878
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:50,240
What the fuck?

879
00:52:50,242 --> 00:52:52,675
Let's just go.

880
00:53:00,819 --> 00:53:02,252
Yeah!

881
00:53:02,254 --> 00:53:03,555
Shit. Come on.

882
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,675
Yeah!

883
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,785
Where the hell
did they come from?

884
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,154
We are seeing
an interesting trend

885
00:53:37,156 --> 00:53:38,756
emerging tonight.

886
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:41,359
Some of the people
participating in violence

887
00:53:41,361 --> 00:53:44,662
have been seen wearing masks
and disguises.

888
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:46,384
The whole world is watching
and wondering...

889
00:54:09,423 --> 00:54:11,755
And psychologists are already

890
00:54:11,757 --> 00:54:14,259
speculating about why
they're doing this,

891
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:16,694
why they're disguising
their identities.

892
00:54:16,696 --> 00:54:20,066
Is it that the participants
are ashamed of this need,

893
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:22,901
ashamed that they want to
commit these acts of violence?

894
00:54:22,903 --> 00:54:25,204
- Have you seen the chief?
- Or is the regalia

895
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:29,208
just a chance for them
to add ceremony and jubilee

896
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,377
to this night of lawlessness?

897
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:41,420
So I...

898
00:54:41,422 --> 00:54:43,823
I release my anger, right?

899
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:46,092
I'm-I'm... I purged, right?

900
00:54:46,094 --> 00:54:47,960
- I'm a new man now, right?
- Uh-huh.

901
00:54:47,962 --> 00:54:49,462
Fuck, man.

902
00:54:49,464 --> 00:54:51,230
- That's dumb shit, man.
- Yo, boss, I was thinking.

903
00:54:51,232 --> 00:54:53,232
You want me to try
to find some new girls

904
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:54,767
to bring up to your office
tonight?

905
00:54:56,737 --> 00:54:58,137
Fuck you, Seven.

906
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:00,373
Fuck you seven
different ways, man.

907
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:02,042
Oh, shit.

908
00:55:02,044 --> 00:55:04,144
Look at these crazy fuckers
bucking the system, yo.

909
00:55:04,146 --> 00:55:05,778
Oh, shit, I mean,

910
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,747
that's illegal,
so I guess they purging, too.

911
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:10,217
Yo, I'll purge like that
every night.

912
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,052
Oh!

913
00:55:27,903 --> 00:55:29,770
Fire at will!
Light those motherfuckers up!

914
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:31,707
Seven. Seven. Seven.

915
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:39,079
All right,
one left, one right!

916
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:40,849
Advance!

917
00:55:42,484 --> 00:55:43,917
Reload!

918
00:55:57,033 --> 00:55:59,768
Zo, we're gonna need some help.

919
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:04,307
Go.

920
00:56:08,446 --> 00:56:10,178
Watch your leg.

921
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:13,147
Come on. Yeah, yeah.

922
00:56:13,149 --> 00:56:14,849
- You good?
- Yeah.

923
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:16,953
The church is right ahead.

924
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:42,144
Oh, my God.

925
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:45,416
All right, let's go.

926
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:48,950
I got like five of 'em, man.

927
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:51,356
Money's good tonight.

928
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:55,958
All right, move out.

929
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,562
I can taste that money.

930
00:56:59,431 --> 00:57:01,264
Let's get some more, man.

931
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:03,065
Come on.

932
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:04,334
A large group of people

933
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:06,035
are participating
on Main and Third.

934
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:08,471
Gang activity across the island
on multiple screens.

935
00:57:08,473 --> 00:57:10,105
Participation levels
increasing.

936
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:11,641
Increasing violence
on various screens.

937
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:14,311
Purgers everywhere,
especially in low-income areas.

938
00:57:14,313 --> 00:57:16,946
All data supported
early violent behavior

939
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:18,181
and then a downturn.

940
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:19,983
This doesn't make any sense.

941
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:21,484
Where are these gangs
coming from?

942
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:22,819
Why weren't they out earlier?

943
00:57:22,821 --> 00:57:26,589
<i>Islanders
are now taking to the streets</i>

944
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:29,059
<i>as we are witnessing
waves of violence</i>

945
00:57:29,061 --> 00:57:30,493
<i>all across the borough.</i>

946
00:57:30,495 --> 00:57:33,430
<i>The governor is sending
500 state troopers tomorrow...</i>

947
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:35,032
Don't question it.

948
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,969
This is a good thing
for both of us.

949
00:57:41,574 --> 00:57:44,177
Nya, we can't go...

950
00:57:50,683 --> 00:57:52,015
Nya!

951
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:53,983
Sorry, sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.

952
00:57:53,985 --> 00:57:54,984
- It's us.
- Jesus Christ.

953
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:56,320
You scared the shit out of me.

954
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:57,522
Are you okay?

955
00:57:57,524 --> 00:57:59,156
What the hell happened
in there?

956
00:57:59,158 --> 00:58:02,093
Bastards went inside.

957
00:58:02,095 --> 00:58:05,262
About a dozen of them
started shooting at everyone.

958
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:07,098
We had to pretend we were dead.

959
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,234
We covered ourselves
in somebody else's blood.

960
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,438
I'm so glad you're okay.

961
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:14,338
D-Dolores. Dolores.

962
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,073
Where's Dolores?
Have you seen her?

963
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,475
We don't know.
We don't know where she is.

964
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:19,411
She left earlier.
She went looking for you.

965
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,446
Isaiah, try Dolores's cell.
See if you can find her.

966
00:58:21,448 --> 00:58:23,281
- No, no.
- No.

967
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:25,117
No!

968
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,285
Some people got out, Nya.

969
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:29,388
But not everyone.

970
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:30,990
Nya.

971
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:34,593
Her phone's off.

972
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,228
We can't be out here anymore.

973
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,662
Let's get to my apartment now.

974
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:39,231
- Okay.
- Come on.

975
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:40,633
Be careful.

976
00:58:46,374 --> 00:58:48,208
Check this out.

977
00:58:49,577 --> 00:58:52,110
They all got the same ink.

978
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,145
What is it?

979
00:58:53,147 --> 00:58:54,547
Mercs.

980
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:57,449
Saw these fuckers overseas
after I enlisted.

981
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,351
They badasses for hire.

982
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:00,585
They'll work
for anyone anywhere

983
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:02,290
as long as the cash is correct.

984
00:59:03,525 --> 00:59:05,091
Like Blackwater
back in the days.

985
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:08,728
Usually ex-military,
and not just American.

986
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:10,965
These fuckers
are the real deal.

987
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:18,406
Show me Park and Fourth
ten minutes ago.

988
00:59:22,076 --> 00:59:23,277
Here.

989
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:25,546
Follow those trucks backwards.

990
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:28,782
Use drones, street cams,
whatever you need access to,

991
00:59:28,784 --> 00:59:30,751
to see where the hell
they came from.

992
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:33,687
There's purging
going on all over the city.

993
00:59:33,689 --> 00:59:35,389
It's turning.

994
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:38,057
- I knew it would.
- Sir.

995
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:40,161
We have a breach
inside a private office.

996
00:59:43,732 --> 00:59:45,299
I tracked those trucks
all the way

997
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:46,533
across the island to here:

998
00:59:46,535 --> 00:59:47,802
a remote area
of abandoned factories.

999
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:49,637
Watch this now.

1000
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:52,141
At around midnight,
something strange happens.

1001
00:59:57,379 --> 00:59:59,179
I did a vehicle search
on all systems,

1002
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,815
and every one of these vehicles
ended up in Park Hill,

1003
01:00:01,817 --> 01:00:03,317
Mariners Harbor and Stapleton.

1004
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:04,751
The low-income areas
of the island.

1005
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:06,553
And they're attacking
crowded places:

1006
01:00:06,555 --> 01:00:09,390
churches, apartment buildings,
Purge parties.

1007
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:11,259
The gangs know
where people are gathering

1008
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:12,594
because of
the tracking implants.

1009
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:14,496
How would gangs know
how to monitor

1010
01:00:14,498 --> 01:00:16,433
the tracking implants?

1011
01:00:17,834 --> 01:00:19,434
They're not gangs.

1012
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:21,369
I want all this footage
on a flash drive.

1013
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:23,404
Did you really think
you could just snoop around

1014
01:00:23,406 --> 01:00:26,374
- an NFFA building?
- I know what you're doing.

1015
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,409
You're sending soldiers
into the island

1016
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:30,245
disguised as gangs,
as citizens,

1017
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:33,716
hunting people down
using the tracking implants.

1018
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:36,284
You're making it look
like people are participating

1019
01:00:36,286 --> 01:00:38,121
because there wasn't
enough purging.

1020
01:00:40,725 --> 01:00:42,223
But they're not soldiers.

1021
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:45,193
They're mercenaries
from all over.

1022
01:00:45,195 --> 01:00:47,195
This country
is overpopulated, Doctor.

1023
01:00:47,197 --> 01:00:48,396
There's too much crime,

1024
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:50,231
- too much unemployment...
- Is that even true, or did you

1025
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:51,767
- falsify those numbers, too?
- And a bankrupt government

1026
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:53,536
that can't afford to care
for its own citizenry.

1027
01:00:53,538 --> 01:00:55,871
People don't want us
to raise taxes?

1028
01:00:55,873 --> 01:00:59,375
Our debt has tripled.
We can't pay for anything.

1029
01:00:59,377 --> 01:01:01,744
We, the NFFA...

1030
01:01:01,746 --> 01:01:05,214
we inherited all this mess.

1031
01:01:05,216 --> 01:01:08,417
All right,
something needed to be done.

1032
01:01:08,419 --> 01:01:09,518
- Not like this.
- Well, what then?

1033
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,722
You tell me, because we
exhausted every possibility.

1034
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:14,760
I need for this to work.

1035
01:01:16,361 --> 01:01:18,227
I need to sell this
on a country-wide scale

1036
01:01:18,229 --> 01:01:19,763
because this is our last hope.

1037
01:01:19,765 --> 01:01:22,231
You're trying to depopulate
the lower classes

1038
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:24,500
just so the NFFA
doesn't have to support them.

1039
01:01:24,502 --> 01:01:26,168
Come on.

1040
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,871
We both know there's...

1041
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:30,674
there's no easy answer
where somebody...

1042
01:01:30,676 --> 01:01:33,210
some group doesn't suffer.

1043
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:35,815
What have I done?

1044
01:01:38,317 --> 01:01:40,650
You saved us.

1045
01:01:40,652 --> 01:01:43,155
I thank you for it.

1046
01:01:44,323 --> 01:01:45,689
No. No.

1047
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:47,157
Don't-don't do this.

1048
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:48,858
The American people
don't need this.

1049
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,894
- Do not build this on a lie.
- I'm terribly sorry.

1050
01:01:50,896 --> 01:01:52,529
- I was wrong.
- The NFFA and America

1051
01:01:52,531 --> 01:01:56,202
will remember you fondly
as a hero to your nation.

1052
01:02:06,479 --> 01:02:08,178
Fucking Russian?

1053
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,914
Something funky going down, D.

1054
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:12,182
Alpha unit
leaving Amsterdam and Oswald.

1055
01:02:12,184 --> 01:02:13,584
We know people on that corner.
Let's go.

1056
01:02:13,586 --> 01:02:14,585
Roger that. Over.

1057
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:16,388
Now. Come on!

1058
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:57,931
It's getting hot out here, D.

1059
01:03:07,508 --> 01:03:09,443
The eyes, Terence.

1060
01:03:14,448 --> 01:03:16,250
The eyes.

1061
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:22,320
Come on, D.

1062
01:03:22,322 --> 01:03:23,690
We got to get out
these streets.

1063
01:03:23,692 --> 01:03:25,293
Got to get home, like, now.

1064
01:03:30,465 --> 01:03:31,966
We're not going home.

1065
01:03:45,681 --> 01:03:47,416
Holy shit.

1066
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:51,417
We need to keep moving.

1067
01:04:39,035 --> 01:04:40,034
Come on, guys.

1068
01:04:40,036 --> 01:04:41,069
We're almost there.

1069
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:42,369
Come on, come on.

1070
01:04:42,371 --> 01:04:44,340
Easy, easy. Come on.

1071
01:04:50,413 --> 01:04:52,047
Hey! Run!

1072
01:05:02,425 --> 01:05:03,491
Isaiah!

1073
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:04,661
Come on!

1074
01:05:17,608 --> 01:05:19,343
Come on.

1075
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,550
Come inside.

1076
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,093
You're a lifesaver, Nya.

1077
01:05:36,427 --> 01:05:37,426
<i>¿Tú estás bien?</i>

1078
01:05:37,428 --> 01:05:38,261
<i>Sí.</i>

1079
01:05:38,263 --> 01:05:39,996
<i>- ¿Tú estás bien?
- Sí.</i>

1080
01:05:39,998 --> 01:05:41,131
Can we...?

1081
01:05:41,133 --> 01:05:42,500
Of course.

1082
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:45,802
Only two hours left
in this experiment,

1083
01:05:45,804 --> 01:05:48,704
and the island is a war zone.

1084
01:05:48,706 --> 01:05:51,875
<i>Yes, Susan.
The NFFA have been releasing</i>

1085
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:54,077
<i>firsthand footage
from some of the participants.</i>

1086
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,147
Nya.

1087
01:05:56,149 --> 01:05:58,615
<i>Mira.</i>

1088
01:05:58,617 --> 01:06:01,751
<i>Some of the footage
looks like a battle zone.</i>

1089
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:03,154
Isaiah injured his neck
the other day.

1090
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:04,955
It was a lot of blood. I...

1091
01:06:04,957 --> 01:06:06,623
I thought I cleaned it all up.

1092
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:09,526
Look, it's nothing
you need to worry about.

1093
01:06:09,528 --> 01:06:12,128
Oh, I'm sorry
about my paranoia.

1094
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,697
It's just...

1095
01:06:13,699 --> 01:06:15,098
This is so crazy.

1096
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,499
Okay. Come with me.

1097
01:06:16,501 --> 01:06:18,803
This is so crazy.

1098
01:06:18,805 --> 01:06:21,205
Come on. It's okay.

1099
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:23,140
I look at her,

1100
01:06:23,142 --> 01:06:25,712
and I think about this night.

1101
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,813
What they're doing to us.

1102
01:06:28,815 --> 01:06:30,547
What they're doing
to this country.

1103
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:33,050
I am worried
about this country.

1104
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:36,586
I'm worried about
our future, you know?

1105
01:06:36,588 --> 01:06:38,655
Okay. Listen.

1106
01:06:38,657 --> 01:06:43,561
We are not going to let
anything happen to her.

1107
01:06:43,563 --> 01:06:45,498
This night will not win.

1108
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,535
Okay.

1109
01:06:51,004 --> 01:06:52,770
Gear up and load the trucks.

1110
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:55,106
Every soldier we have
is on their way.

1111
01:06:55,108 --> 01:06:56,974
Check this out.

1112
01:06:56,976 --> 01:06:59,510
I got some brand-new shit
this week.

1113
01:06:59,512 --> 01:07:01,113
Gun dealer said we got
a big new batch

1114
01:07:01,115 --> 01:07:02,614
from an unknown supplier.

1115
01:07:02,616 --> 01:07:04,983
This shit was cheap,
got all new tech.

1116
01:07:04,985 --> 01:07:06,818
I snatched it all up, yo.

1117
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,687
The hell is this?

1118
01:07:08,689 --> 01:07:10,255
This is an explosive device.

1119
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:12,126
It's like C-4
with a handheld detonator.

1120
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:17,829
NFFA been putting all this shit
in the streets, y'all,

1121
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:19,731
hoping that we'd off
each other.

1122
01:07:19,733 --> 01:07:22,067
We didn't, and now they're
stoking the fire

1123
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:24,203
in another motherfucking way.

1124
01:07:24,205 --> 01:07:26,005
Our neighborhood
is under siege, gentlemen,

1125
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:30,043
from a government who doesn't
give a shit about any of us.

1126
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:31,777
Now, there's a lot
of good people out there

1127
01:07:31,779 --> 01:07:32,979
who we're gonna have
to protect now.

1128
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:36,015
See, the NFFA forgot
about one thing.

1129
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:37,183
They forgot about us.

1130
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:43,189
This is our home.

1131
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:46,092
So let's show these
white-haired motherfuckers

1132
01:07:46,094 --> 01:07:48,797
never to fuck
with our island again.

1133
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:53,199
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1134
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,741
Thank you, sir. That's more
than we could've imagined.

1135
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:03,309
Yeah, it seems like
the people...

1136
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:04,944
people really needed this.

1137
01:08:04,946 --> 01:08:06,716
Okay.

1138
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,645
Now make that footage
disappear.

1139
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:40,781
It's me.

1140
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,950
- It's Dolores! Open up!
- What the fuck?

1141
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,818
Well, I guess nobody
missed me, huh?

1142
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,087
Dolores, you're okay.

1143
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:48,756
No, I'm not okay.

1144
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,992
I was out there looking
for your little narrow ass.

1145
01:08:50,994 --> 01:08:52,327
I was scared to death
out there.

1146
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:53,828
I lost my damn cell phone.

1147
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,263
I couldn't call nobody
for help.

1148
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:57,599
Then I get the bubble guts,
tried to run home.

1149
01:08:57,601 --> 01:08:59,167
That was a bad idea
'cause I realized

1150
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:00,634
I don't have my asthma pump.

1151
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,270
Oh, but it gets better.

1152
01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:04,039
'Cause I shit on myself
a little bit

1153
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:06,041
when I was on my way home.

1154
01:09:06,043 --> 01:09:07,803
My fucking bowels
done joined the Purge, too.

1155
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,960
We're safe.

1156
01:09:25,062 --> 01:09:26,730
For now.

1157
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:45,347
We have three
four-man fire teams,

1158
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:47,416
all equipped
with M-4 assault rifles,

1159
01:09:47,418 --> 01:09:49,785
frags, RPGs and flashbangs.

1160
01:09:49,787 --> 01:09:51,754
Copy that.

1161
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:53,856
Citizens
are mounting a resistance

1162
01:09:53,858 --> 01:09:55,157
against Charlie team
on Fourth and Bay.

1163
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:57,027
Echo, transit to assist.

1164
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,396
Echo heading that way.

1165
01:09:59,398 --> 01:10:02,935
A'ight, well,
here's what we're gonna do.

1166
01:10:09,974 --> 01:10:10,974
Motherfuckers!

1167
01:10:18,684 --> 01:10:19,952
Fuck you!

1168
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:24,688
I'm hit!

1169
01:10:26,725 --> 01:10:29,695
- Oh, shit. Shit.
- Come on, come on.

1170
01:10:32,231 --> 01:10:33,999
Shit.

1171
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:38,137
Here. Put that on there.

1172
01:10:41,774 --> 01:10:43,040
Move! Move!

1173
01:10:48,148 --> 01:10:49,813
I'm out!

1174
01:10:49,815 --> 01:10:51,215
Me, too!

1175
01:10:51,217 --> 01:10:53,251
I'm out!

1176
01:10:55,355 --> 01:10:57,190
Everybody, down!

1177
01:11:12,506 --> 01:11:15,072
Move!

1178
01:11:15,074 --> 01:11:17,074
Oh, shit!

1179
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:20,451
To the right! To the right!

1180
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:22,948
Link. Right now. Link.

1181
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,049
They coming.

1182
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:25,184
Here.

1183
01:11:25,186 --> 01:11:26,954
- Here.
- Give me one.

1184
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:32,359
You kill as many of them
motherfuckers as you can.

1185
01:11:33,761 --> 01:11:35,894
You make it count.

1186
01:11:35,896 --> 01:11:37,331
Let's do this.

1187
01:12:45,434 --> 01:12:47,536
Hey. Stay back.

1188
01:12:56,045 --> 01:12:59,280
Well, as I live and breathe.

1189
01:12:59,282 --> 01:13:01,583
- The devil himself.
- He shall appear.

1190
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,251
Let's get these Wise Men
some more weapons.

1191
01:13:04,253 --> 01:13:06,053
Beta on Second,
en route to towers with Echo.

1192
01:13:06,055 --> 01:13:07,354
Yo, D.

1193
01:13:07,356 --> 01:13:08,455
You gotta hear this.

1194
01:13:08,457 --> 01:13:10,858
ETA ten minutes.

1195
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:14,496
Proceed to housing project
towers on Main and Bay.

1196
01:13:14,498 --> 01:13:15,799
Nya.

1197
01:13:21,104 --> 01:13:22,872
Let's go.

1198
01:13:23,974 --> 01:13:25,275
What the hell is going on now?

1199
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:34,051
Shit.

1200
01:13:35,586 --> 01:13:37,422
Oh, my God.

1201
01:13:51,268 --> 01:13:53,470
These motherfuckers
is here already.

1202
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,239
What's the move, D?

1203
01:13:57,241 --> 01:13:59,676
We know these towers better
than whoever they are.

1204
01:13:59,678 --> 01:14:02,311
Seven, I want you to go through
the back with Blaise, a'ight?

1205
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,379
Through the courtyard.

1206
01:14:03,381 --> 01:14:05,047
Have everyone else come out
the emergency exits

1207
01:14:05,049 --> 01:14:06,482
on the south side
and wait for me and Zo.

1208
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:07,983
Outside the main quarter,
all right?

1209
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,352
Me and Zo, we're gonna go
through the...

1210
01:14:09,354 --> 01:14:11,253
Get down!

1211
01:14:16,194 --> 01:14:18,063
Zo!

1212
01:14:27,272 --> 01:14:29,207
No. No!

1213
01:14:31,643 --> 01:14:33,044
Fuck.

1214
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:44,156
Shit.

1215
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:47,292
Shit.

1216
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:56,902
Fuck!

1217
01:14:58,303 --> 01:14:59,636
Seven, I got you.

1218
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:02,073
- Where you hit? Where you hit?
- No, no.

1219
01:15:02,075 --> 01:15:04,375
No, you gotta go to the towers.

1220
01:15:04,377 --> 01:15:05,710
Nya.

1221
01:15:05,712 --> 01:15:08,346
You gotta go.

1222
01:15:08,348 --> 01:15:09,549
Go.

1223
01:15:18,324 --> 01:15:20,291
<i>Coño,</i> this is not a gang.

1224
01:15:20,293 --> 01:15:21,626
It's like a goddamn army.

1225
01:15:21,628 --> 01:15:23,094
No, this is
some straight bullshit.

1226
01:15:23,096 --> 01:15:24,095
That's a fucking militia.

1227
01:15:24,097 --> 01:15:26,264
- We need to try to sneak out of here.
- How?

1228
01:15:26,266 --> 01:15:27,466
They're coming in
through all the exits.

1229
01:15:27,468 --> 01:15:28,467
Front, back, sides.

1230
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:29,535
So, what do we do?

1231
01:15:29,537 --> 01:15:31,035
We hole up and arm ourselves

1232
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:32,571
with anything we can find,
and fight.

1233
01:15:32,573 --> 01:15:34,174
We are not giving up.

1234
01:15:35,442 --> 01:15:37,444
Okay.

1235
01:15:40,547 --> 01:15:42,380
Here's what's
gonna happen, Nya.

1236
01:15:42,382 --> 01:15:43,614
They're gonna move
from floor to floor,

1237
01:15:43,616 --> 01:15:45,050
killing as many
as they can, okay?

1238
01:15:45,052 --> 01:15:46,585
You on the 14th floor,
so you got time.

1239
01:15:46,587 --> 01:15:49,121
I want you to move
to the back of the apartment

1240
01:15:49,123 --> 01:15:51,356
- and you find a safe place to hide, a'ight?
- A'ight.

1241
01:15:51,358 --> 01:15:53,025
Stay strong, Ny.

1242
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:54,295
I'm coming.

1243
01:17:21,685 --> 01:17:23,787
Stay down, stay down!

1244
01:17:35,332 --> 01:17:36,833
All clear.

1245
01:17:41,271 --> 01:17:43,405
All right, help me out.

1246
01:17:43,407 --> 01:17:45,307
Come on, come on.

1247
01:17:46,677 --> 01:17:47,811
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1248
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,580
Push it against the door.
Come on.

1249
01:17:51,582 --> 01:17:53,481
Yeah, block the door.

1250
01:17:53,483 --> 01:17:55,384
Okay.

1251
01:17:55,386 --> 01:17:56,821
Isaiah, use this, okay?

1252
01:18:03,728 --> 01:18:05,730
Three, two, one!

1253
01:18:19,677 --> 01:18:22,113
Open it up! Open it up!

1254
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:44,598
Fuck out my neighborhood.

1255
01:20:34,315 --> 01:20:35,315
Breach!

1256
01:20:44,059 --> 01:20:46,993
The fuck?

1257
01:20:46,995 --> 01:20:48,360
Defensive positions!

1258
01:20:48,362 --> 01:20:49,796
Lost visual, Captain.

1259
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:51,800
Samuels, what's going on?

1260
01:20:55,337 --> 01:20:56,436
What the fuck is going on?

1261
01:20:56,438 --> 01:20:57,838
- Someone tell me!
- Can't see shit!

1262
01:21:31,941 --> 01:21:33,744
We've got a problem.

1263
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:38,746
Nya, where's the baseball bat?

1264
01:21:38,748 --> 01:21:40,514
- Closet.
- Selina, look in the closet.

1265
01:21:40,516 --> 01:21:41,917
Yo, what the hell is all this?

1266
01:21:41,919 --> 01:21:43,584
We having a fucking barbecue
or something?

1267
01:21:43,586 --> 01:21:45,920
Oh, shoot.
I forgot something, y'all.

1268
01:21:45,922 --> 01:21:48,082
- Wait. Check this out.
- Selina, look in here.

1269
01:21:49,092 --> 01:21:50,991
- Whoa.
- Jesus.

1270
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:52,393
That's a hand cannon.

1271
01:21:52,395 --> 01:21:53,928
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

1272
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:55,931
No way, Dolores.
Have you used that gun before?

1273
01:21:55,933 --> 01:21:56,933
I have.

1274
01:21:58,669 --> 01:21:59,835
Old boyfriend.

1275
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:01,002
Let me see that.

1276
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:02,504
Geez.

1277
01:22:02,506 --> 01:22:04,673
There's only
five bullets in here.

1278
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,575
It beats a damn spatula.

1279
01:22:06,577 --> 01:22:07,642
She's right.

1280
01:22:07,644 --> 01:22:08,946
Come on.

1281
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:49,919
They'll be coming
through this door.

1282
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,120
They're going to have on
body armor.

1283
01:22:51,122 --> 01:22:52,488
I'm-a shoot low, their legs.

1284
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:53,990
Isaiah, you jump in
and finish them off

1285
01:22:53,992 --> 01:22:55,091
- with a knife.
- Got you.

1286
01:22:55,093 --> 01:22:56,859
Aim for the neck
above the armor.

1287
01:22:56,861 --> 01:22:58,694
Yo, who the fuck
was your old boyfriend?

1288
01:22:58,696 --> 01:22:59,829
Everybody else, in the closet.

1289
01:22:59,831 --> 01:23:01,732
- No.
<i>- Pérate.</i>

1290
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:03,734
- We're in this together.
- No matter what happens,

1291
01:23:03,736 --> 01:23:05,534
you stay in that closet.

1292
01:23:05,536 --> 01:23:06,603
For Selina.

1293
01:23:06,605 --> 01:23:08,739
Go. Go.

1294
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:09,940
Nah, I'm not getting
in no closet.

1295
01:23:09,942 --> 01:23:11,008
I'm staying out here with you.

1296
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,043
- Go.
- Yo, this is

1297
01:23:13,045 --> 01:23:14,811
my fucking fight, too.
Let's do this.

1298
01:23:14,813 --> 01:23:16,079
All right.

1299
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:17,682
Let's do it.

1300
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:25,589
Breach! Breach!

1301
01:23:29,495 --> 01:23:31,195
Hug the wall.

1302
01:23:31,197 --> 01:23:32,930
Good on left!

1303
01:23:32,932 --> 01:23:35,166
Link it up.

1304
01:23:35,168 --> 01:23:36,202
Link!

1305
01:23:41,707 --> 01:23:44,110
- All clear to left.
- Clear on right.

1306
01:24:05,866 --> 01:24:06,934
Get back!

1307
01:24:08,135 --> 01:24:09,534
Pull the strap!

1308
01:24:09,536 --> 01:24:11,005
- I can't.
- Get his arm, too.

1309
01:24:17,744 --> 01:24:19,544
Yo, what the fuck
is really going on?

1310
01:24:19,546 --> 01:24:20,712
I'm confused.

1311
01:24:20,714 --> 01:24:21,874
Nothing to be confused about.

1312
01:24:23,049 --> 01:24:24,249
- Help has arrived.
- D.

1313
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:25,250
You a'ight?

1314
01:24:25,252 --> 01:24:27,753
Yeah.

1315
01:24:27,755 --> 01:24:29,322
Well, I'll be damned.

1316
01:24:29,324 --> 01:24:31,690
Little Miss Nya
and Dmitri Cimber,

1317
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:34,126
the big fucking dog
of Park Hill.

1318
01:24:34,128 --> 01:24:36,028
Well, now I know how you know
how to use that gun

1319
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,296
- so damn good.
- What up, D?

1320
01:24:37,298 --> 01:24:39,865
We got a lot of talking to do
after all this is done, a'ight?

1321
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:42,901
Unit three,
what's your sitrep on the 14?

1322
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:44,105
Three, come in.

1323
01:24:45,272 --> 01:24:46,807
Stay here.

1324
01:24:53,281 --> 01:24:54,814
He's up here.

1325
01:24:54,816 --> 01:24:56,282
Took out half our team.

1326
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:58,619
Kill everyone on this floor.

1327
01:25:07,862 --> 01:25:09,762
- Is there anyone else here?
- Yeah, in the closet.

1328
01:25:09,764 --> 01:25:11,731
- You'll be joining them, Nya.
- Why? What's up?

1329
01:25:11,733 --> 01:25:13,167
No time to explain.
Help me with this body, Isaiah.

1330
01:25:13,169 --> 01:25:14,968
- Make time.
- They coming, Nya.

1331
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:16,636
A lot of 'em.

1332
01:25:16,638 --> 01:25:19,005
I got one chance to stop it,
but I gotta do it alone.

1333
01:25:19,007 --> 01:25:20,874
- What are you talking about, alone?
- No time to explain.

1334
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:22,776
- Get in the closet now.
- But, D, it's almost over.

1335
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:24,144
"Almost" doesn't count
tonight, man. Let's go.

1336
01:25:24,146 --> 01:25:26,012
Make room. Do not move.

1337
01:25:26,014 --> 01:25:27,213
Do not make a sound.

1338
01:25:27,215 --> 01:25:28,815
Do not come out,
no matter what you hear.

1339
01:25:28,817 --> 01:25:30,016
- Understand? Understand?!
- Yes.

1340
01:25:30,018 --> 01:25:31,885
- I got you.
- Okay, okay.

1341
01:25:31,887 --> 01:25:33,256
Why you doing this?

1342
01:25:34,624 --> 01:25:35,923
You gotta go.

1343
01:25:35,925 --> 01:25:37,324
- A'ight, now.
- No.

1344
01:25:37,326 --> 01:25:39,026
I'm with you.
And don't you try

1345
01:25:39,028 --> 01:25:40,995
to talk me out of it, either.
It won't work.

1346
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,404
Ready!

1347
01:25:50,406 --> 01:25:52,273
- Move forward!
- Move it!

1348
01:25:52,275 --> 01:25:54,175
Move forward! Move forward!

1349
01:25:54,177 --> 01:25:56,113
Get down!

1350
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,235
Here.

1351
01:26:27,044 --> 01:26:28,812
- Load it up!
- Load it!

1352
01:26:30,747 --> 01:26:33,381
Wait!

1353
01:26:33,383 --> 01:26:34,823
You're going to get killed
out there.

1354
01:26:37,955 --> 01:26:40,225
- Light him up!
- Light him up!

1355
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:47,963
Motherfuckers!

1356
01:26:47,965 --> 01:26:49,998
Brother and sister are mine!

1357
01:26:51,469 --> 01:26:53,269
Not yours!

1358
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:55,837
Come here.
I want you to just throw it,

1359
01:26:55,839 --> 01:26:56,972
and I'm-a shoot it, okay?

1360
01:27:01,779 --> 01:27:02,881
Go!

1361
01:27:16,728 --> 01:27:17,795
Nya!

1362
01:27:42,154 --> 01:27:43,854
Jesus Christ.

1363
01:27:43,856 --> 01:27:46,257
It's not all my blood.
I'll be...

1364
01:27:46,259 --> 01:27:48,326
I'll be fine.

1365
01:27:49,995 --> 01:27:51,262
Hey.

1366
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,268
Thank you.

1367
01:28:07,047 --> 01:28:08,448
Thank you.

1368
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,420
- Nya.
- Nya.

1369
01:28:15,422 --> 01:28:17,989
- Help him up. Help him.
- You all right?

1370
01:28:17,991 --> 01:28:20,391
Slow. Slow, slow, slow.

1371
01:28:23,129 --> 01:28:25,330
I got you.

1372
01:28:25,332 --> 01:28:26,531
Okay.

1373
01:28:50,157 --> 01:28:51,158
It's over?

1374
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:55,296
For now.

1375
01:29:02,436 --> 01:29:05,070
Dolores, come on.

1376
01:29:05,072 --> 01:29:09,575
We need to make sure
nobody else needs help.

1377
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:12,078
All right, now, make a path.

1378
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,180
Come on, y'all. Move back.

1379
01:29:15,484 --> 01:29:17,117
- You okay, baby?
- Y'all got this.

1380
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:18,399
- Thanks, D.
- Y'all stay strong.

1381
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:21,254
- Stay strong, y'all.
- Back up.

1382
01:29:21,256 --> 01:29:22,988
- Way to go, Dmitri.
- Are y'all deaf?

1383
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:24,291
Saved us, baby.

1384
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:26,559
Big dog of Park Hill
is coming through.

1385
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:28,295
Looking out, D. We owe you one.

1386
01:29:28,297 --> 01:29:30,563
- Real soldier.
- Thank you, Nya.

1387
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:33,166
Move back.
I'm not gonna ask twice.

1388
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:35,935
I've had a very,
very long night.

1389
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:37,137
Thanks, D.

1390
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:38,938
Thank you so much.

1391
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,273
Oh, my goodness.

1392
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:42,375
So, what do we do now?

1393
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,244
Now...

1394
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:45,947
we fight.

1395
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:50,252
Come on.

1396
01:29:52,187 --> 01:29:53,989
Stay strong, all right?

1397
01:30:33,363 --> 01:30:35,062
<i>Well, the turnout was bigger</i>

1398
01:30:35,064 --> 01:30:36,931
<i>than we ever expected.</i>

1399
01:30:36,933 --> 01:30:40,102
Staten Island and its citizens
have proven

1400
01:30:40,104 --> 01:30:42,637
that this experiment
was necessary.

1401
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,141
Uh, we will, of course,
study the results,

1402
01:30:46,143 --> 01:30:49,411
but, uh, I've received word
from President Bracken

1403
01:30:49,413 --> 01:30:52,147
that we're considering
a nationwide Purge,

1404
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:55,050
uh, as the people
are now calling it,

1405
01:30:55,052 --> 01:30:57,085
uh, as early as next year.

1406
01:30:57,087 --> 01:31:00,590
One where every U.S. citizen
can participate.
