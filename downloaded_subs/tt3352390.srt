1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,646
Everyone, please.

2
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,767
Please.

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,162
It's my unfortunate responsibility
to share with you some terrible news.

4
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,090
It seems that over the weekend,

5
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,048
your fellow student, Marina Mills,
committed suicide.

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,090
Is it true that she filmed it
on her webcam?

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,410
One of your classmates died and all you
care about is whether you can see it?

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,481
Apparently there was a video uploaded
to the university website this morning.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,527
Some of you were crafty enough
to grab it before we could take it down.

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,529
I urge you not to... To watch it.

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,849
Anyone caught sharing it
will be suspended.

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,689
Period. No discussion.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,523
Were any of you friends with Marina?

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,171
Or have any info
that can shed light on this tragedy?

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,523
Well, if so, see me after class.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,323
Liv, this video's so cute!

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,040
- So not scared.
- Yeah, right.

18
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,006
So good.

19
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,401
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,080
- Hey. Hey.
- Hello.

21
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,367
- Someone didn't come home last night.
- Yeah, again.

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,600
So are you guys, like,
monogamous now or what?

23
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,081
- Liv, it's not a dirty word. Jesus.
- I know.

24
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,010
Clearly, I'm just jealous,
you know, being dumped.

25
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,521
You were not dumped.
You knew him for one day.

26
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,005
It was an amazing day.

27
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
Mmm, yeah. Yeah, I like that. Yeah.

28
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,566
- Eww!
- Oh, my God.

29
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,360
- It's disgusting...
- Oh, no.

30
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,688
So you're in a... In a relationship?

31
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,531
Oh, here we go.

32
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,400
No, it's super cool, it really is.

33
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,800
I just, you know,
love all these precious little updates

34
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,564
about you and Doctor Surfboard.

35
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,563
- Good for you.
- Oh, shut up.

36
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,883
What do I look like?
I'm a sophisticated lady.

37
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,405
Wine and dine me.

38
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
Another argument

39
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,210
that Internet Addiction Disorder
doesn't belong in the DSM

40
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
is that it's frequently
symptomatic of other disorders,

41
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,082
depression, anxiety, trauma.

42
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,764
Often, it's an escape from things
we don't wanna deal with,

43
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,680
from our everyday lives...

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,524
...to things far, far worse.

45
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,760
Though the most common disorder
might just be

46
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,251
that we have too much time on our hands...

47
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,091
Play it cool.

48
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,764
- Wait a few days.
- He already knows I'm not cool.

49
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,200
I think we might have an excellent example

50
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,126
of Internet Addiction Disorder
right here in class.

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,966
Aside from Miss Woodson and Miss Mathison,

52
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,604
does anyone else here experience symptoms?

53
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,640
- Look at that. That's a nice one.
- I love it.

54
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,290
Oh, I really like that filter.

55
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,880
- I can show you how to do it.
- Look at Kobe.

56
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,645
Jesus. When's he gonna get over you?

57
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,200
Such a creeper.

58
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,408
- He is not a creeper.
- Ooh.

59
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,085
Who's that?

60
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,811
A girl in my class.

61
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,566
Zero friends.
How is that not, like, super weird?

62
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,640
Maybe she just started
her profile or something.

63
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,807
Is she, like, 12-years-old?

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
Huh.

65
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,684
I think she's really talented.

66
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,846
I like it.

67
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,524
You like it when she rips
her hair out during class?

68
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,687
Oh, come on.

69
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,007
Dude, I literally saw her
pull an eyelash out today.

70
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,970
No. It's a condition.
It's called trichotillomania.

71
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,280
You would know all about it if you cracked
open a textbook every once in a while.

72
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
- Owned!
- Oh, whatever.

73
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm actually changing majors next year.

74
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,645
Oh, yeah? And the year after that?

75
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
- Owned!
- Come on.

76
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
- Twofer.
- Whatever.

77
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,726
What you making? Is that seafood curry?

78
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,640
- That looks good.
- What? Seafood curry?

79
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,484
No, this is paella...

80
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,360
Well, my dad was a psychiatrist,
so I guess I, you know,

81
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,966
- wanna follow in his footsteps.
- That's nice.

82
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,360
Mmm.

83
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,808
Are you doing it for credit or are
you just... You really wanna do it?

84
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,486
I'm not sure.

85
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,481
I just transferred.

86
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,490
- I... I don't know anyone yet.
- Well, now you know me.

87
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,084
Are you in the dorms?

88
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,720
My friends and I,
we just got an apartment.

89
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,486
It's amazing, but we're definitely
not getting any work done.

90
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,721
- Too many friends.
- Exactly.

91
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,325
I'll see you around campus.

92
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,251
Bye, Laura.

93
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,086
Hmm.

94
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,690
I thought med students had homework.

95
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,520
You're one to talk.

96
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,080
What? I'm studying.
Internet Addiction Disorder.

97
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,680
- And you're your own case study.
- Exactly.

98
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,209
What's the deal with this girl?

99
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,051
I don't know. I think she's lonely.

100
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,010
She gonna be your friend
or your first mental patient?

101
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,529
She'd be my second mental patient.

102
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,840
She's going through every post
I've ever made in my life.

103
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,526
Oh, whoa. She's crazy.

104
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,530
Look what she just sent me.

105
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,290
Wait, I wanna see.

106
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,170
Oh.

107
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Really, you guys are gonna
live happily ever after together.

108
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,964
- Oh, my God.
- Nice.

109
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,890
Who is this person?

110
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,800
I don't know.

111
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,042
Dude, scroll down.
I wanna see her timeline.

112
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,326
Further.

113
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,006
Further.

114
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,960
Whoa.

115
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,731
Jesus.

116
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,885
No wonder this girl's
giving you nightmares.

117
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,765
Jesus.

118
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,920
- OK.
- Oh, my God.

119
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,561
Laura, this girl isn't right.
Why are you hanging out with her?

120
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,450
I was just trying to be nice.

121
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,200
God, I can't believe
you invited her to your birthday.

122
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,204
No, no, no, no, I didn't invite her.
She invited herself.

123
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,280
What was I supposed to say?

124
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,203
Erm, how about something like "Fuck, no"?

125
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,767
- Yeah, that sounds about right to me.
- You can't say that to someone.

126
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,280
- Oh, yeah, it goes like this.
- Yes, you can.

127
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,200
It goes like this. "Hey, Laura,
can I come to your birthday?"

128
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,248
"Fuck, no." There you go.

129
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,640
Laura, finally.

130
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,006
Happy birthday.

131
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,640
You look so pretty.

132
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,480
- Thanks, Marina.
- You get my messages?

133
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,608
Yeah. How can I miss them?

134
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,080
Are you mad at me?
Did I do something wrong?

135
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,766
No, I'm not mad at you. I'm just...

136
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,009
- I'll see you in class tomorrow, OK?
- But what about tonight?

137
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,443
Aren't you celebrating with your friends?

138
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,843
Er... It's just Tyler and I tonight.

139
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,770
We're going out to dinner,
so just the two of us.

140
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,049
But you barely know her.
Isn't tonight just you and your friends?

141
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,846
I know, I know.
I just feel, you know, icky lying about it.

142
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,047
Well, you don't look very icky to me.

143
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,689
Mmm!

144
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,484
All right, go ahead.

145
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,200
Hi. Hey.

146
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,885
Hi, Mom.

147
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,889
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Hey.

148
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,726
I've been trying to get
your mom as drunk as possible.

149
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,881
You, beautiful guy,
you need to get drunk immediately

150
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,490
so we know what you're made of.

151
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,130
Happy birthday!

152
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,486
This is gonna be... A good time...

153
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,725
Yeah!

154
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,760
Yeah, it's literally her!
That was our inspiration.

155
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
And the last reason, no matter what,

156
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,606
that you always find
some crazy way to make me feel better.

157
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,684
Aww.

158
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,246
Wait, wait, wait, to my little green bean
who makes me so proud every day,

159
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,886
and who made her father so proud
every single second.

160
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,201
Oh, Mom.

161
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,009
All right, I'm gettin' in,
I'm jumping in this little love boat.

162
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,400
- No, I'm going, I'm going, OK?
- Oh, no.

163
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,720
Er... This is... This is to us.

164
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,200
A wonderful evening.

165
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,681
To the future, to success.

166
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,282
And you shut up, you drunk floozy.

167
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,400
And then, this is also to, just to you,
to happy birthday.

168
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,811
- Thanks, guys.
- Cheers.

169
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,846
- Hey, Laura. How are you doing?
- Hey. How are you?

170
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,650
- Good. Good.
- That's good.

171
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,482
I thought we were friends.

172
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,080
Marina, what are you,
what are you talking about?

173
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,004
I saw you with everyone.
Your birthday dinner. I saw it.

174
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,964
Marina, I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

175
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,689
Can we talk about this later? OK?

176
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,130
I had a present for you.
I worked on it for two weeks.

177
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,842
Two weeks?
You've barely known me for two weeks.

178
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,689
You're a fucking liar
just like everyone else!

179
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,800
Why did you accept my friendship?
You didn't have to do that!

180
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,960
Get off me.

181
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,600
You have any idea how it feels
to be alone?

182
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,800
Completely alone?

183
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,800
Get off me, you freak!

184
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,003
Oh, God.

185
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,403
Laura, you didn't do anything wrong.

186
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,204
This chick is just damaged.

187
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,085
You weren't there, Tyler.

188
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,840
It's not your fault.

189
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,640
Baby, I'm really sorry, I gotta get back
to cutting up dead people.

190
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,840
OK.

191
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,764
She's trying to face-chat me.
What do I do?

192
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,405
Don't take the call.

193
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,360
- Seriously.
- Fine, all right.

194
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,090
I'll talk to you later.

195
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,531
OK. Bye.

196
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,481
Liv?

197
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,966
Hmm.

198
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,930
Are you OK?

199
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,570
Go to bed.

200
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,485
Remind me after class to tell you a story.

201
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,648
Please. Everyone, please.

202
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,606
It's my unfortunate responsibility
to share with you some terrible news.

203
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,851
It seems that over the weekend,

204
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,009
your fellow student, Marina Mills,
committed suicide.

205
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,326
How'd it go?

206
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,171
Fine.

207
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,849
I just told them she was
stalking me and kind of went crazy.

208
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,845
Hey, don't beat yourself up about it.

209
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,480
- That girl was completely nuts.
- She needed help, though.

210
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,528
Yeah, like, serious help.

211
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,407
Not from a sophomore in Psych 201.

212
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,120
Look on the bright side. Might be able
to get out of class for the funeral.

213
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,440
God.

214
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,522
No, no, no. There's not gonna be
a funeral, there's no body.

215
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,046
What do you mean?

216
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,086
Cops were at my dorm this morning and...

217
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,202
They don't know where she did it,
but it wasn't there.

218
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,084
I heard she hasn't swiped her key card
since last weekend.

219
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,529
And that's not what freaks me out.
What freaks me out,

220
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,162
is that they don't know
who this girl even was.

221
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,362
Her, uh, contact info,
her social security,

222
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,363
it's all been deleted
from the school database.

223
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,204
They don't even think
that Marina Mills was her real name.

224
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,202
- Are you serious?
- You all right?

225
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,840
That's weird.

226
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,684
You're killing my cheeseburger vibe.

227
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,289
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

228
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,603
Why are you watching this?

229
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,688
- Who sent you this crap?
- She did.

230
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,968
- She's dead.
- I know.

231
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,320
Again, you'll have 60 minutes.

232
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,161
This is an actual case study,
a very challenging one.

233
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,046
Oh, my God.

234
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,047
God.

235
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,680
Is that the video? I thought you said
it was in your messages.

236
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,886
You posted it?

237
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,570
No, no. Someone did. I didn't.

238
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,761
And they tagged all my friends.

239
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,604
Laptops away, Miss Woodson.

240
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,403
Why would they think I did that?
I would, I would never do that.

241
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,847
- Did you try changing your password?
- Yes, yes. I tried everything.

242
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,766
- She's even back in my friends list.
- Unfriend that dead bitch.

243
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,891
I can't.

244
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,880
So, according to you, Miss Woodson,
this video just magically appeared

245
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,200
on your timeline this morning?

246
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,130
- Do I have that right?
- Why would I do this?

247
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,127
There must be some reason
this girl burned that picture of you.

248
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,929
Look, Laura, we know
that you're a great student,

249
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,966
but multiple students
reported you harassing Marina.

250
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,328
No. She was the one harassing me.

251
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,040
She was obsessed with me.

252
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,930
Laura, no one's saying it's your fault
that Marina took her life.

253
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,766
We're looking into everything.

254
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,760
But in the meantime, Laura,
if you can't delete that video,

255
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,161
you're gonna have to delete your profile.

256
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,966
Hey, one more thing. Any idea where
this girl might have torched herself?

257
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,080
No.

258
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,600
No, you're not listening to me.
I can't delete this video.

259
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,364
I can't even delete my account.

260
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,040
Like I said, this isn't a call centre.

261
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,880
OK, well, what about the dead girl
I can't unfriend?

262
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
Can you do something about that?

263
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,930
- Ma'am, I'm not seeing this profile.
- What? I just saw it.

264
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,240
Is there anyone else I can speak to?

265
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,049
I'm afraid they'll just tell you
the same thing.

266
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,691
What's next?

267
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,564
Kobe, I know you're in there.
I can hear your stupid game.

268
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,529
That was a nice video you posted.

269
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,843
Yeah, that's what I'm here about.

270
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,361
Wow.

271
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,440
You're her only friend.

272
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,363
- How special is that?
- Shut up.

273
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,522
Christ, someone's still uploading things.

274
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,765
That... That's intense.

275
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,404
I fucking love it.

276
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,283
All right. OK, let's take
a little peek behind the curtain.

277
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,281
What?

278
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,289
You have no idea how crazy that is,
do you?

279
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,041
OK.

280
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,242
Look at that. Oh, that...

281
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,805
That is what code normally looks like.

282
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,241
Not this.

283
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,085
I can't even copy this.
This isn't, this isn't code.

284
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,090
Well, what is it?

285
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,605
I don't know.

286
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,930
Wait, wait. Can you go back?

287
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,880
Just stop looking at that girl's profile.

288
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,769
Just stop thinking about her.

289
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,886
She killed herself. End of story.

290
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,608
She burned and hung herself
in front of her laptop.

291
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,485
Who does that?

292
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,961
Is this gonna be a thing now,
you and Kobe hanging out in his dorm room?

293
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,240
Is that really
what you're thinking about right now?

294
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,687
Yeah. I'm thinking about us.

295
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,131
What's wrong with that?

296
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,641
He's just a friend. You know that.

297
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,251
Does he?

298
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,002
It's called cyber stalking for a reason.

299
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,762
They can't bother you
if you're not online.

300
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,480
Uh, yeah.

301
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,848
Get me some of those, uh,
chocolate macadamia crisp thingies.

302
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,960
No, they're not, uh...
Chocolate potato chips.

303
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,800
They're like cookies.

304
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,160
Like, uh, crackers, kind of.
Just ask the guy there.

305
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,687
I go there all the time. The white
chubby kid who loves chocolate.

306
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,000
Babe, you're not chubby.
But you're very fussy. My God.

307
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,721
I'm not being fussy. I'm on my period
and chocolate makes me feel better.

308
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,566
Isabel?

309
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,045
Hello?

310
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,325
Shit.

311
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,406
Jenn?

312
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,401
Hello?

313
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,205
Kobe?

314
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,809
Hey, guys, this isn't funny.

315
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,000
Seriously.

316
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,406
Guys?

317
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,171
Koobes, come on, man.

318
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,964
What the hell?

319
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,805
What...

320
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,320
What the f...

321
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,362
No. No, no, no. No.

322
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,605
Ugh.

323
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,880
No!

324
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,200
No!

325
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,881
OK, so she's barely talking right now.

326
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,566
They're gonna keep her overnight,
maybe longer.

327
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,330
You can see her if you want.

328
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,561
Listen...

329
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,729
I didn't know Gustavo that well.

330
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,687
Was he on something?

331
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,606
No.

332
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,160
I saw the medical report.

333
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,844
It is insane.

334
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,531
Please, just leave.

335
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,525
Sweetheart.

336
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,760
This is all her fault.

337
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,524
She's not herself, Laura.

338
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,442
No. Gus wasn't himself.

339
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,929
He was having nightmares.

340
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,320
So am I.

341
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,051
You're scaring us, Izz.
What are you talking about?

342
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,885
Laura knows.

343
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,286
She knows.

344
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,970
It doesn't feel real.

345
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,321
Promise me you won't look
at that girl's profile today.

346
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,604
You're driving yourself crazy.

347
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,006
Delete your account.

348
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,641
Seriously.

349
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,405
You want Isabel to see that?

350
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,684
- Liv, you know I can't.
- I don't care how.

351
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,645
Just do it.

352
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,001
Fuck.

353
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,001
Fuck.

354
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,123
Even if it's not you behind these posts,

355
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,840
I'm getting a lot of pressure
from the students.

356
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,880
As long as the posts are up,
I have no choice but to suspend you

357
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,201
for the rest of the semester.

358
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,291
Mom, you don't always have
to call me on FaceTime, you know.

359
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,320
- Why didn't you call me?
- I'm sorry.

360
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,289
I... I didn't want you to worry, OK?

361
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm coming to pick you up.
I want you home.

362
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,883
No, look... Look, I'll call you later.
I promise, OK?

363
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,401
Look at that.

364
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,406
What the hell?

365
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,927
Yeah. She friended him
right before he died.

366
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,682
And there's something else.

367
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,840
- Jesus, Kobe...
- I don't want you to watch it.

368
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,285
I want you to listen.

369
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,520
What is that?

370
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,560
I don't know, I think it's wasps.

371
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,688
She's got black wasps
all over her profile.

372
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,890
I did some research, and, um,
some people associated them with evil.

373
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,771
They say they appeared
wherever witches lived.

374
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,444
That they'd, like, follow them around
and protect them.

375
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,201
Jesus.

376
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,646
Who was this girl?

377
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,810
Do you think you could
get us into her room?

378
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,407
Come on.

379
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,324
Not much into fashion, was she?

380
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,005
Do you even know what you're looking for?

381
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,686
Well, just anything.

382
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,885
Oh, hey, hey. Look, look, look.

383
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,371
- That's her.
- Yeah, and who are these two?

384
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,523
Can you find what school this is?

385
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,124
If it's ever been online, yeah.

386
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,922
Are you the young lady who called?

387
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,646
Marina's friend?

388
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,205
Yes.

389
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,521
How close did you say you were again?

390
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,130
I was just getting to know her when she...

391
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,200
I didn't even know her real name.

392
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,486
Nedifar.

393
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,491
Marina Nedifar.

394
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,131
Do you know what happened to her parents?

395
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,810
I wouldn't know anything about that.
She came to us as a ward of the state.

396
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,731
Poor girl. She had such
a rough go of things here.

397
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,520
She was always very sensitive,

398
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,886
always alone,

399
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,927
fleeing into her little fantasy worlds.

400
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,691
And she found some dark corners online,

401
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,844
things no child should see.

402
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,362
Sometimes she would just stare
at the computer for hours.

403
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,128
Nothing on the screen at all.
Just her own reflection in the darkness.

404
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,202
The kids became terrified of her.

405
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,085
They said she gave them nightmares.

406
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,760
Get off me! Don't touch me!

407
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,520
Get off me! Get off me!

408
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,330
Fuck!

409
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,640
Jesus!

410
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,360
The two boys in the photo,

411
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,249
they were found dead near Saddle Mills

412
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,850
with their faces mutilated.

413
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,520
- They were swarmed by black wasps.
- What?

414
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,207
Tyler, I know you could get in trouble
for this, but, please, can you...

415
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,409
Can you access her records somehow,

416
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,040
like a family contact or a last address?

417
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,360
Something?

418
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,281
- We don't even know her last name.
- Nedifar.

419
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,925
Marina Nedifar.

420
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,965
Laura?

421
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,885
Hello?

422
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,685
Hello?

423
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,770
Is anybody here?

424
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,771
Hello!

425
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,486
This is not real. This is not real.

426
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,289
Oh, God. Oh, God.

427
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,040
This is not real.

428
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,610
This is not real! No!

429
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,483
Miss Woodson?

430
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,805
Hello?

431
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,845
She rips out her own hair
before she slits her throat.

432
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,365
Now, I've been on this job 25 years,

433
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,045
and that's a first for me.

434
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,683
There some shitty new drug
we don't know about?

435
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,130
They never took anything.

436
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,361
What I want to know is, where you got
the elevator footage that you posted.

437
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:33,008
For the last time,
I'm not posting any of this.

438
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,560
Well, the good news for you is

439
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,206
we can't link your IP address
to any of these videos.

440
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,408
We couldn't find any address at all,
which doesn't make any sense,

441
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,091
unless you're familiar
with our IT department.

442
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,244
It all has to do with this girl.

443
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,565
You really know a lot of dead people,
Miss Woodson.

444
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,849
This is not real!

445
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,164
I don't think this was a suicide, Laura.

446
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,645
I think it was a ritual.

447
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,525
Erm, that, what you're looking at here,
these are, these are black mirrors.

448
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,366
They've been used in the occult
for thousands of years.

449
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,810
And they say that if you,
if you stare into it,

450
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,960
you can communicate with some other side.

451
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,361
It's called scrying.

452
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,368
But sometimes these witches,

453
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,160
if they were being hunted,
if they didn't have any other...

454
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,321
Any other way out,

455
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,440
they would hang and burn themselves

456
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,841
in front of a black mirror
and become something else.

457
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,687
You call it whatever you want,
an evil spirit...

458
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,364
Erm, a, a demon.

459
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,680
Point is, it's how
they got revenge on people.

460
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,889
Possessing them and, and
haunting them and killing them.

461
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,406
How'd they ever stop it?

462
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,567
It says they had to find
the original mirror,

463
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,409
the one they burnt themself in front of,
and destroy it.

464
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,368
You mean... Her laptop.

465
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,569
It was her black mirror.

466
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,767
We need to find out
where she killed herself.

467
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,131
What?

468
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,609
I mean, there...
There has to be something here.

469
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,642
You know, something that can help us.

470
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,645
I think I'm going home.

471
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,125
I can't handle this.

472
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,487
I'm so sorry for everything.

473
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,160
Please don't go.

474
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,765
I'm sorry.

475
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,331
I can't.

476
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,283
- Way to pay your respects!
- Seriously. You're disgusting.

477
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,886
You're late.

478
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,801
Why is everyone talking about you?
What have you done to this girl?

479
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,690
I haven't done anything to her!
She just...

480
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,724
Attached herself to me.

481
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,204
Now everyone thinks that...

482
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,080
Please, I want you home, baby.
You're coming home with me.

483
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,528
Well, I can't, I can't.
I have to stay and figure it out.

484
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,000
Figure what out?

485
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,080
...others suffered serious injuries.

486
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,403
Police have a suspect in custody,
but are not releasing any information

487
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,927
until they complete their investigation.

488
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,451
Moore's Grove.

489
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,727
It's a deserted farm town
about two hours away.

490
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,840
There was a fire there 20 years ago.
It's some weird commune.

491
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,680
Marina's mother, Ada Nedifar, lived there,

492
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,922
until somebody burned
the whole place down.

493
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,126
What?

494
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,965
They kept some...

495
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,205
Husk of her body alive

496
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,363
until Marina was delivered.

497
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,444
She was alone in the womb for months.

498
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,964
Jesus. She was always alone.

499
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,087
Do you think this is where
she went to kill herself?

500
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,603
I mean, it's the only lead we have.

501
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,331
What's going on with her profile?
What's that on there?

502
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,360
Hey, it's Olivia. Leave me a thing.

503
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,930
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

504
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,526
Stop right here.

505
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,840
Stop right here and let me out.

506
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,445
Oh, my God!

507
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,363
Oh, my God.

508
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,526
Olivia! Olivia!

509
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,724
Olivia!

510
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,805
Get out, get out. Help her!

511
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,566
- Help her!
- Help me.

512
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,400
She's stable. That's what matters.

513
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,165
Thank you so much, Doctor.
I appreciate it.

514
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,484
She's stable.
She might actually make it through this.

515
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,289
Even if she does...

516
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,602
Marina's never gonna stop.

517
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,487
Shit.

518
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,165
Just... Just stay here.

519
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,091
Stay with Liv. Please.
Don't let her be alone.

520
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,651
Where are you going?

521
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,086
Whoa.

522
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,006
Someone had a rough day.

523
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,850
What happens if there are still
people living there?

524
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,209
I mean, what is this place now?

525
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,801
I don't know.

526
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,207
No matter what, I'm finding that laptop,
I'm gonna fucking smash it.

527
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,885
- Kobe...
- Yeah?

528
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,369
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Who says I'm doing it for you?

529
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,205
Where the hell are you?

530
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,728
The cops are asking me
a million questions.

531
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,881
I'm... I'm going to Moore's Grove,
I'm sorry.

532
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,047
Don't go there alone.

533
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,128
I... I'm not alone. I'm...

534
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,571
I'm with Kobe.

535
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,571
I'm coming to meet you.

536
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,848
So, where is she?

537
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,923
I don't know, man. Bad reception.

538
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,206
- Yeah.
- All right.

539
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,567
Keep trying.

540
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,360
Shit.

541
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,290
- Charming.
- Yeah.

542
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,646
Thanks.

543
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,242
Shit. There's no service.

544
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,804
What are you so fucking
nervous about? You're gonna be fine.

545
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,120
What are you talking about?

546
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,640
You said she wants to make you lonely.

547
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,769
If that's true, then you are
the only one that's safe.

548
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,404
Oh, hey, sweetheart.

549
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,485
I said no.

550
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,440
No Chinese food.

551
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,000
Mmm-mmm, no.

552
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,321
No, no, no. I said no Chinese.

553
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,244
No Chinese. I said n...

554
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,320
Sure, yeah. No, I mean, we...
We could have Chinese. I...

555
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,845
From down...

556
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,644
No, down... The one by the...

557
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,645
Yeah, I'll call you back.

558
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,280
Please, please, please.

559
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,840
No, I don't want to die.

560
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,081
Please.

561
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,650
Oh, my God.

562
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,561
Really?

563
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,570
Oh, my God.

564
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,000
Laura?

565
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,440
- Kobe?
- What?

566
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,846
She's not here.

567
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,045
Did you check the basement?

568
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,367
What basement?

569
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,525
Kobe?

570
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,491
Kobe?

571
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,641
Kobe?

572
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,361
Kobe.

573
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,645
What's wrong?

574
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,807
I'm sorry.

575
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,404
She can't make you lonely if you're dead.

576
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,805
Laura!

577
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,880
Laura?

578
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,362
Hey, it's Laura. Leave a message.

579
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,280
What do you mean,
you don't know where she is?

580
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,680
What happened back there?

581
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,120
Hey, dum-dum, I'm fucking talking to you!

582
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,760
What happened?

583
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,840
Listen to me. If you touched her,
I'll fucking kill you.

584
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,960
Now where the hell is she?

585
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,929
She's absolutely fine!

586
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,244
We are completely fucked.

587
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,600
She's just peachy.

588
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,361
Tyler.

589
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,080
Laura, thank God.

590
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,520
I thought something happened to you.

591
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,409
I... I just texted you an address.

592
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,247
Laura...

593
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,800
- The factory at Saddle Mills.
- I can't hear you. You're breaking up.

594
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,880
Tyler?

595
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,122
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you to a hospital?

596
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,929
Take me to the factory.

597
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,931
Still think we can beat this, don't you?

598
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,487
Shut up, man.

599
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,170
Seriously.

600
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,764
You got no idea what we're dealing with.

601
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,649
I do. I saw where we're headed.

602
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,280
- Shut up, man!
- I fucking saw it!

603
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,681
- Shut up!
- You tell me you're going to die for her!

604
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,487
Cos we've all been dying for her!

605
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,520
Stay in the car, man.

606
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,610
Mom?

607
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,563
Laura, where have you been?
I can't reach you.

608
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,931
Mom, are you OK?

609
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,242
I'm seeing things, Laura.

610
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,890
I keep seeing that girl.

611
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,645
I'm sorry.

612
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,125
It's my fault.

613
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,561
What's happening to us?

614
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,924
Listen to me. I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

615
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,160
I'm going to sort this out somehow.

616
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,447
I'm going to stop this somehow.

617
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,766
Mom?

618
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,002
- Mom? Mom!
- I want to protect you.

619
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,606
Mom!

620
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,081
Mom!

621
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,920
Mom!

622
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,360
Laura?

623
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,326
Laura!

624
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,805
Tyler.

625
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,121
Tyler.

626
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,562
I was so worried about you.

627
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,640
Laura? Hey.

628
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,006
Laura.

629
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,525
Look at me.

630
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,483
My mom, she's...

631
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,165
Jesus.

632
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,484
What happened to you?

633
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,161
Hi.

634
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,961
What do you want from me?

635
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,451
What else do you want from me?

636
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,323
I just want to be friends, Laura.

637
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,605
Best friends.

638
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,325
Forever.

639
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,369
Laura.

640
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,010
Laura.

641
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,569
Come to me.

642
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,529
Come to me.

643
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,685
Come to me.
