You point them in the right direction
and shit gets real.

175
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,402
Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:08,791
Hi. Um, I just wanted to meet you...

177
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,763
...or something?
I'm Jennifer Check.

178
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:13,057
And... this is my friend.

179
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:13,996
Hi.

180
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,299
I'm Nikolai, and this is...

181
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:18,063
...this is my band.

182
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,940
Low Shoulder.

183
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,921
Yeah, we heard... I heard of that band...

184
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,215
You play instruments really...

185
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:25,884
...super good.

186
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:28,804
Thank you, we're professionals.

187
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,272
Hey, sorry...

188
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,558
Can I ask you a question?

189
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,799
Why would you want to play all the way out
here in the Devil's Kettle?

190
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:37,146
You live in city, right?

191
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,571
Yeah. But, you know what...

192
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:41,847
I think is really important sometimes to try
and connect with our fans in their...

193
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:44,133
...shitty areas too.

194
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:46,218
Thas amazing.

195
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:52,067
Can l-Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure, what are we having?

196
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:55,091
They have this really awesome
9/11 tribute shooter?

197
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:57,376
Is red, white and blue,
but you have to drink it really fast...

198
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,575
...or it turns brownish.
- Alright, I'll drink it fast.

199
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,443
Okay.
- Okay.

200
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,494
I'll be right back.

201
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,031
Okay! How-how you're gonna get alcohol?

202
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:09,785
I'll just play hello titty with the bartender.

203
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,152
Dirk, what about her?

204
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,759
Who, Jan Brady?

205
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,227
No, man! Fuck you!

206
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:26,896
I'm talking about the one who just went
to get me a drink...

207
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:29,807
...butter-face princess.
Thas the one.

208
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:32,483
I don't know! Seriously,
I grew up in a town like this, okay...

209
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:36,794
...there's always that girl, if they show it off,
they do not give it up.

210
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:38,462
You told us, you were from Brooklyn.

211
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,529
My point is, this girl's definitely a virgin.
Okay?

212
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,449
Now, I know girls like that...
- I don't know.

213
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,856
Well, you know, we didn't turn all the
way out here for nothing.

214
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,724
So...
- Excuse me.

215
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,149
Hey!
- Hey!

216
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:53,791
Thas my best friend you're talking about.

217
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,815
And you're right, she is a virgin,

218
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,944
And not be sleeping with creeps like you.

219
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,856
The second one isn't full enough.

220
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,467
Those guys are rank, Jen.
Just forget about it.

221
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:19,974
You know what?
I think the lead singer likes me.

222
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,477
Only because he thinks you're a virgin.
I heard them talking.

223
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,302
What?

224
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:27,786
I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore,
thanks to Roman.

225
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:30,254
And by the way, that hurts.

226
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,175
I couldn't even go to flags the next day.

227
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,295
I had to stay home and sit on a
bag of frozen peas.

228
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,380
Oh, God!

229
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:42,394
Good evening, Devil's Lake.
- Devil's Kettle.

230
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,575
You're absolutely right at it.

231
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,121
<b>"Through the Trees"
performed by Low Shoulder</b>

232
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:06,578
<i>All alone in an empty room,</i>

233
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:11,688
<i>Nothing left but the memories of when...</i>

234
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,947
<i>... I had my best friend.</i>

235
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:17,436
<i>I don't know how we ended up here,</i>

236
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:22,742
<i>I don't know but is never been so clear,</i>

237
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:27,226
<i>We made a mistake, dear.</i>

238
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,980
<i>And I see...</i>

239
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:35,472
<i>... the broken glass in front of me.</i>

240
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,279
<i>I see...</i>

241
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:42,459
<i>... your shadow hanging over me.</i>

242
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:46,830
<i>And your face, I can see...</i>

243
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,376
<i>Through the trees,</i>

244
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:54,026
<i>I will find you.</i>

245
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:59,865
<i>I will heal the ruins left inside you,</i>

246
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,392
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

247
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:08,520
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

248
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:12,387
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

249
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:15,889
<i>Until I'm set free.</i>

250
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:19,365
<i>Go quiet through the trees.</i>

251
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,797
<i>I remember how we used to talk,</i>

252
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:28,334
<i>About the places we would go when...</i>

253
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:29,906
<i>... we were off.</i>

254
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:32,922
<i>And all that we were gonna find.</i>

255
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:39,665
<i>And I remember our seeds grow,</i>

256
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,316
<i>And how you cried when you saw...</i>

257
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:44,705
<i>... the first leaves show.</i>

258
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:06,291
Hey, get out of there.

259
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,690
I know where to go.

260
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,551
Is okay, okay, Jen.

261
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:45,196
Jennifer?
- Oh, thank God, you guys are alright.

262
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,690
I have been looking everwhere for you two.

263
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,201
This sucks!
Is too dangerous out here.

264
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,426
You want to head somewhere safer,
like my van?

265
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,198
What?

266
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:58,848
I'm in survival mode, right now.
I want us to get to a familiar place...

267
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,942
...and right now, I feel like thas my van.

268
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,185
Okay...

269
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:04,479
Okay, this will help with the shock.
Great.

270
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:07,086
Are you shocked?
Have some of that.

271
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,859
No.

272
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,840
Jennifer?

273
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:15,950
Hey!

274
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,495
Les go, Jennifer.

275
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,102
Les go to the van.
- I want to go to your really cool van.

276
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:25,139
Needy, les go see his van.
- Why? Why should we?

277
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,421
We have the Sebring,
les just get out of here, please.

278
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,089
Needy, just stop it.

279
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,383
Just shut up!

280
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:51,418
<i>I watched her get into that van and I knew
something awful was going to happen.</i>

281
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,603
<i>He was skinny and twisted
and evil...</i>

282
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,662
<i>... like this petrified tree I saw
when I was kid.</i>

283
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,224
Hey, Niedermeyer.
- Thank God, you're there.

284
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,518
What wrong?
- Jennifer's gone.

285
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:02,219
She ran off with that rock band.
And Melody Lane burned down.

286
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:04,713
You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

287
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,737
There was this huge stampede and...

288
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,927
All the people who fainted got run over.

289
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:13,377
And you could hear their bones breaking.

290
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,141
And the people...

291
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,965
Like... the people on fire just smelled like...

292
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,093
This is crazy.
- But Jennifer's still with those creeps.

293
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,473
They took her in their spooky van with
the windows all blacked out.

294
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:29,115
Did you get the make and model?
- I don't know, Chip. An '89 Rapist.

295
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,274
She's still in there.
We have to go find her.

296
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,399
Who cares about Jennifer and
those douchebags...

297
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:35,371
...with their douchebag haircuts and
their manskirts.

298
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:37,457
People just burned to death.

299
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:41,072
Oh, cheese and fries!
There's somebody here.

300
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,652
I'm alone and I'm freaked out.
- Where's your mom?

301
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,321
Swing shift.

302
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:51,222
Stay on the phone with me, okay?

303
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:58,104
Needy, you want me to come over?
- I don't know.

304
00:20:58,313 --> 00:20:59,981
Maybe.

305
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:13,016
Needy?

306
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:21,150
Chip, there's no one here.

307
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,487
So strange.

308
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:27,198
Maybe I'm going crazy.

309
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,439
Probably nothing.

310
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:34,185
Look, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

311
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,480
Hi.

312
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,202
What happened?

313
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:13,980
Jen?

314
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:18,465
Jen?

315
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:48,288
My mom got that at Boston market and...

316
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,104
Um, is on your lips...

317
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:24,682
Jennifer...

318
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:26,976
Jennifer?

319
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,861
Are you scared?

320
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:15,362
Jennifer!

321
00:25:29,857 --> 00:25:31,942
There's a body in here.

322
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,849
I heard Needy and Jennifer were there.

323
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:44,977
And they had to fight their way out
with a machete.

324
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:47,236
Look, she's not even mØving.

325
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,878
Is called post-traumatic stress disorder.

326
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:52,867
My Dad was in operation during freedom...

327
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:56,761
...and he totally like, stopped talking,
like months.

328
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:04,373
I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie,
and you be her.

329
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:07,293
Why I should be ugly Ashley?

330
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:10,108
What wrong, Jennifer?

331
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,066
Don't tell my mom about this.
She'll make me get a shot.

332
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,248
I never tell on you.

333
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,566
Where's it at, Monistat?

334
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,884
You're alright.
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

335
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,160
I saw last night in my house...
- You do have a tendency to overeact.

336
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:39,850
You remember, when we were
in Girl Scout camp...

337
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:41,505
...and you totally thought there was
an earthquake...

338
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,625
...but it was just two guys with
a ghetto blaster?

339
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:50,256
People died, Jennifer.
Is like all over the news.

340
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:52,446
National news.

341
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,053
Anybody that we know?

342
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,556
We know everyone!

343
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:00,788
Sucks to be them, I guess.

344
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:06,219
What is wrong with you?
- Whas wrong with you?

345
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:09,443
Besides the obvious surface flaws.

346
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,093

beaten up or shot or something.

376
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:30,863
And then she barfed up this like disgusting...

- Yuck.

379

She'd probably just inhaled a whole bunch
of smoke or something.

380

It was like evil!

talk to the school shrink.

She's just staring out the front window like
a zombie mannequin robot statue.

520
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:34,520
This can't be a coincidence.

521
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:37,336
What you talking about, Needy?
- A fiery death trap last night,

522
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,994
And now a cannibal psycho takes down
the biggest guy in school, come on.

523
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,175
Is freaktarded.

524
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,929
Well, the bad luck's gotta be over, right?

525
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:49,962
I mean, it can't get any worse, right?
It can't.

526
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:51,830
I mean, you agree, right?

527
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:54,020
You're shaking.

528
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:55,237
I'm cold.

529
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:58,713
Is very cold out here.
- You want my hoodie?

<i>All alone in an empty room.</i>

532
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:06,534
The days marched on as usual,

533
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:09,662
...but most of us were too numb
to enjoy ourselves.

534
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:11,504
Most of us.

535
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:15,050
<i>I don't know how we ended up here.</i>

536
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:19,882
<i>I don't know but is never been so clear.</i>

537
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:24,261
<i>We made a mistake, dear.</i>

538
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:28,232
<i>To the rest of the world we were famous.
We were saints.</i>

539
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:30,483
<i>Our town's only bar had burned to the ground.</i>

540
00:40:30,518 --> 00:40:33,959
<i>And our star line-backer was
someone's snack pack.</i>

541
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:37,722
<i>The whole country got a huge tragedy boner
for Devil's Kettle.</i>

542
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:39,243

543
00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:42,614
<i>They couldn't get enough of our little
world of shit.</i>

544

545
00:40:47,724 --> 00:40:51,061
<i>I will find you.</i>

546
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:58,369
<i>I will heal the ruins left inside you.</i>

547
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:02,219

548
00:41:02,323 --> 00:41:05,556

551
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:16,192
<i>Go quiet through the trees.</i>

552
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:18,591
<i>Still, we were healing.</i>

553
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:22,345
<i>Like Chip, we figured things could
only get better.</i>

554
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,952
<i>We had faith.</i>

555
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:28,080
<i>We were fucking idiots.</i>

556
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:33,607
Before the period ends, I would like to
make an announcement.

557
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:37,778
As you all know, today is the
one month anniversary of...

558
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:39,968
...the tragedy at Melody Lane,

559
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,784
...and the murder of Jonas Kozelle.

560
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,869
Boring.

561
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:48,102
As I was saying, Jennifer...

562
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:49,353
...and Needy.

563
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:52,065
I finally got some good news to
share with all of you.

564
00:41:52,169 --> 00:41:54,993
The members of the rock n' roll group
Low Shoulder,

565
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:59,364
...have decided to extend a helping hand
to our community.

566
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:01,450
As you all know, their song...

567
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,979
'Through the trees'

568
00:42:03,014 --> 00:42:07,289
...has become our unofficial anthem
of unity and healing.

569
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:11,565
And they have decided to release it
as a benefit single.

570
00:42:11,669 --> 00:42:16,362
3% of the profits will go to local families
who have been affected by loss.

571
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:19,177
What about the other 97%?

572
00:42:19,594 --> 00:42:22,097
I mean, thas just crass. Right?

573
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:24,808
Crass.

574
00:42:24,913 --> 00:42:27,945
It means greedy. Exploitative.
Scummy.

575
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,274
Low Shoulder are American heroes.
- No, they're not.

576
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:33,324
I was there, Chastity.

577
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,140
They didn't helped anybody escape the fire.

578
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:37,948
I don't even know how that
rumor all got started.

579
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:39,303
Rumor?

580
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:40,450
Rumor?

581
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,979
Is true!

582
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:44,065
Is on the Wikipedia.

583
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,175
We wouldn't even know who they were
if they hadn't been playing that night.

584
00:42:48,271 --> 00:42:51,087
They used by us.
- You take that back, Needy Lesnicki!

585
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:51,782
Girls?

586
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:53,589
We need them now more than ever.

587
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:55,258
Thas enough.

588
00:42:58,803 --> 00:43:03,496
I'm already sick of that song.
- Yeah, is really poorly produced.

589
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:06,833
Could the bass be any lower in the mix?
- No offense,

590
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:09,027
...but you really look tired.

591
00:43:09,062 --> 00:43:10,908
Is everything, okay?
- No.

592
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:12,777
I feel like boo-bbo.

593
00:43:12,985 --> 00:43:17,791
My skin is breaking out and
my hair is dull and lifeless.

594
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,894
Oh, God.

595
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,536
Is like I'm one of the normal girls!

596
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,726
Are you PMS-ing or something?

597
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:25,151
PMS isn't real, Needy.

598
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:28,732
It was invented by the boy-run media
to make us seem crazy.

599
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,903
Don't look at me like that.

600
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:37,908
Is just wearing off or something.
- Whas wearing off?

601
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:42,705
Hello, Needy.

602
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:43,539
Hi.

603
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:44,895
Jennifer.

604
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,251
Hey, Collin.

605
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,440
Can I borrow your English homework again?

606
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:50,005
I forgot to read Hamlet.

607
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:52,194
Is he gonna fuck his mom?

608
00:43:53,237 --> 00:43:56,261
I don't... I don't...
I don't think so.

609
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:58,729
I sort of wanted to ask you something.

610
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:01,162
You want to know if I'll go out with you?
- No.

611
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:03,457
Yeah! What?

612
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:07,732
How-How did you know?
- Just go ahead with the pitch.

613
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,382
Okay.

614
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:15,874
Well, we have been having a lot fun
in the class, you and I,

615
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,160
...and I thought maybe you would like to go,
see a movie...

616
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:19,933
...or something.

617
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:24,834
There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror
at the Bijou, next weekend.

618
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,337
I don't like boxing movies.

619
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:30,986
Yeah, but...
Is not a...

620
00:44:32,863 --> 00:44:34,080
Fucking boxing movie.

621
00:44:34,115 --> 00:44:37,139
Fuck it, okay.
Forget it.

622
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,476
That was random.

623
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,291
I'm used to boys asking me out, Needy.

624
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:46,315
Collin's really nice.

625
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:49,409
He's into maggot-rock.
He wears nail polish.

626
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:52,781
My dick is bigger than his.
- Well, I think he is really cool.

627
00:44:53,302 --> 00:44:55,492
You do?
- Yeah.

628
00:44:57,786 --> 00:44:59,872
Wait! Collin?

629
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:04,156
Why don't you just come by
my place tonight?

630
00:45:04,252 --> 00:45:08,631
I just got Aquamarine on DVD.
Is about this girl who like, half-sushi.

631
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:11,551
I guess she has sex through her blowhole
or something.

632
00:45:13,532 --> 00:45:15,201
Okay.

633
00:45:17,078 --> 00:45:18,190
Great! Yeah.

634
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:21,145
Okay, I'll text you my address.

635
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:23,648
Cool.

636
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,966
Hi.
- Hi.

637
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,763
Hi, Chip.

638
00:45:36,161 --> 00:45:38,038
Get a room.

639
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:42,105
So talking to your mysterious pal
Collin Gray, again?

640
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:42,904
No.

641
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:46,798
He was asking Jennifer out on a date.
- Thas weird.

642
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:49,196
So, you're gonna come over tonight?

643
00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:50,829
Sure. I'd like that.

644
00:45:50,864 --> 00:45:53,889
I went to Super Target and
picked up more condoms. So,

645
00:45:54,097 --> 00:45:55,983
Thanks.
- Not that that has anything to do with...

646
00:45:56,078 --> 00:45:57,643
Oh, no. I didn't assume that.

647
00:45:57,678 --> 00:45:58,998
Well, I'm...

648
00:45:59,415 --> 00:46:02,022
Okay, I'll see you tonight then.

649
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:04,525

00:50:52,545 --> 00:50:53,900
<i>I wanna...</i>

691
00:50:58,176 --> 00:51:03,807
<i>I wanna love you, love you,
you already know.</i>

692
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,064
You made it.

693
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:15,695
Whas going on?

694
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,516
This...

695
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:27,478
This isn't really your house, is it?

696
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:29,842
No, baby.

697
00:51:29,877 --> 00:51:31,858
This is our house.

698
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:33,839
Just for you and me.

699
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:37,385
We can play Mommy and Daddy.

700
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,543
Do you even know my last name?

701
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:51,358
Silly.

702
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,278
I've been sending you signals all year.

703
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,198
Couldn't you tell?

704
00:51:57,511 --> 00:52:00,222
You give me such a wettie.

705
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:19,827
Put it in.

706
00:52:41,517 --> 00:52:43,081
Jennifer!

707
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,757
What?

708
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:46,800
Are you scared?

709
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:50,381
I mean, I thought boys like yØu were
really into... vermin.

710
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,049
Death and shit.

711
00:52:53,092 --> 00:52:54,865
Here you go.

712
00:52:57,784 --> 00:52:59,870
Nice hardware, ace.

713
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,296
No way...

714
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:34,873
Shit!

715
00:53:34,908 --> 00:53:36,941
Oh, puncture wound!

716
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:38,975
God, thas so emo.

717
00:53:43,146 --> 00:53:45,232
I need you frightened.

718
00:54:17,662 --> 00:54:20,269
I need you hopeless.

719
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,048
Hopeless!

720
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:50,198
What?

721
00:54:51,553 --> 00:54:53,326
What?

722
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:55,933
Am I hurting you?

723
00:54:58,436 --> 00:55:00,521
Am I too big?

724
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:06,570
What?

725
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:12,409
Needy! Whas wrong?

726
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:14,912
Is it something I did?

727
00:57:02,945 --> 00:57:05,344
Mommy! Mommy?

728
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:34,229
Are you scared?

729
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,647
Hi.

730
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,088
Hi, Needy!
Enough with this screaming.

731
00:58:17,123 --> 00:58:19,278
You're such a cliche.
- Get out!

732
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:24,388
But we always share your bed when
we have slumber parties.

733
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,834
I'm not gonna bite you.

734
00:58:41,281 --> 00:58:43,784
How may you own that T-shirt?

735
00:59:50,314 --> 00:59:53,394
What the fuck is happening?
- My God, Needy!

736
00:59:53,429 --> 00:59:56,475
I have never heard you drop
the F-bomb before.

737
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:59,751
You! I saw you! I saw you!
- Buh-buh-buh.

738
00:59:59,786 --> 01:00:02,932
Slow down, tardy slip.
You sound like a sped.

739
01:00:03,036 --> 01:00:04,704
I'm gonna call the police.

740
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,416
Oh, okay! Why don't you narc me out.

741
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,127
I've the cops in my back pocket, Needy.

742
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:12,838
I'm fucking a cadet, remember?

743
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:15,306
What you want from me?

744
01:00:15,341 --> 01:00:18,261
Just only explain some things to you.

745
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:22,849
Besides, best friends don't keep secrets.
Right?

746
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,716
Incase, you remember the night of the fire?

747
01:00:26,812 --> 01:00:28,862
I got really messed up.

748
01:00:28,897 --> 01:00:30,783
And those guys from Low Shoulder.

749
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:32,512
Totally evil.

750
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:37,657
They are basically like agents of Satan
with really awesome haircuts.

751
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:41,724
<b>"Finishing School"
performed by Dashboard Confessional</b>

752
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:48,050
Where-Where are we going?

753
01:00:48,085 --> 01:00:50,587
You don't have to talk,
if you don't want it.

754
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:02,162
Are you guys rapists?

755
01:01:02,684 --> 01:01:04,769
Oh, God! I hate girls.

756
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:12,590
Are you even sure she's
fucking virgin, man?

757
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:15,414
Yes!
Yes, I'm a virgin!

758
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:19,369
I'm virign! I never-never even done sex.
I don't know how.

759
01:01:19,404 --> 01:01:23,644
So... you guys find somebody who does.

760
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:25,208
Know how.

761
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:26,007
See, Dirk?

762
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:28,337
I told you, man.
You owe me a beer.

763
01:01:28,962 --> 01:01:30,109
What did they do to you?

764
01:01:30,214 --> 01:01:31,882
Just let me finish.

765
01:01:32,403 --> 01:01:33,872
So they drove me out to the falls.

766
01:01:33,968 --> 01:01:37,513
And I kept looking for a way to escape but...

767
01:01:37,548 --> 01:01:40,120
...is really dark out there.

768
01:01:48,775 --> 01:01:50,548
Where are you going, huh?

769
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:53,259
We got a waxing moon tonight, you guys.

770
01:01:53,364 --> 01:01:55,449
Just like the ritual said.

771
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:10,153
Why don't you guys have something to
shut up her up with?

772
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,158
Dirk, get a knife and tie it well.

773
01:02:15,262 --> 01:02:17,035
Because I don't want it to get uncord.

774
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:29,653
I don't know if we should go
through with this.

775
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:32,886
Dirk.

776
01:02:33,094 --> 01:02:36,118
You wanna work in musical copy forever?
I don't.

777
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:37,057
Okay?

778
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:39,455
You wanna be a big loser or...

779
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:41,341
...do you wanna be rich...

780
01:02:41,436 --> 01:02:44,982
...and awesome like that guy from Maroon 5?

781
01:02:47,068 --> 01:02:48,840
Maroon 5.

782
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:51,099
Okay, so I thought.

783
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,220
Go and fetch me the ritual, brother.

784
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:02,709
Thank you.

785
01:03:03,856 --> 01:03:04,795
Alright.

786
01:03:04,899 --> 01:03:08,341
Thas it?
- Yeah, I found it online.

787
01:03:09,488 --> 01:03:13,659
We come here tonight to
sacrifice the body of...

788
01:03:16,057 --> 01:03:17,726
Whas your name again?
Tiffany?

789
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,811
My name is Jennifer.

790
01:03:19,846 --> 01:03:20,610
Super.

791
01:03:20,645 --> 01:03:21,758
We come here tonight...

792
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:25,025
...to sacrifice the body of Jennifer
from Devil's Kettle.

793
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,694
Please, please...

794
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:31,073
Please let me go. I'll do anything.
I'll do any fucking...

795
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,989
Do you know how hard it is to make it
as an indie band these days?

796
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:42,753
There's so many of us,

797
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:47,132
We're all so cute and is like if you don't
get on Letterman...

798
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:50,991
...or some retarded soundtrack,
you're screwed, okay?

799
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:52,764
Satan is our only chance.

800
01:03:53,181 --> 01:03:54,536
We're in league with the beast now.

801
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:57,248
And we have to make a really
big impression on it.

802
01:03:57,283 --> 01:03:59,855
And to do that, we're going to
have to butcher you.

803
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:01,106
And bleed you.

804
01:04:01,314 --> 01:04:03,087
And Dirk here is gonna wear your face.

805
01:04:03,122 --> 01:04:04,860
Relax, I'm kidding about the face.

806
01:04:05,069 --> 01:04:07,154
The rest is gonna happen though.

807
01:04:10,282 --> 01:04:12,368
You know what?
May be we'll write a song about you.

808
01:04:12,403 --> 01:04:14,454
I think as a fan that would be
pretty cool, right?

809
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,612
With the deepest malice,

810
01:04:25,924 --> 01:04:28,218
We deliver this virgin unto thee.

811
01:04:28,253 --> 01:04:30,513
Dude, that is a hot murder weapon.

812
01:04:30,548 --> 01:04:31,868
Is a bowie knife.

813
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:33,189
Bowie? Nice.

814
01:04:33,224 --> 01:04:35,310
Alright, here we go!
Is gonna be alright.

815
01:04:35,345 --> 01:04:38,029
Help me please... please...
Help me...

816
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,315
Wait a sec!
I just thought of something.

817
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:42,296
Jen.

818
01:04:42,609 --> 01:04:43,825
Jen, you're the girl for me.

819
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,571
You don't know me.
But you make me so happy.

820
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:49,283
I tried to call you before,
but I lost my nerve.

821
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:52,203
I used my imagination.

822
01:04:52,307 --> 01:04:55,018
But I was disturbed.

823
01:04:55,435 --> 01:04:58,616
Jenny, I got your number.

824
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:01,797
I need to make you mine.

825
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:05,238
Jenny, don’t change your number,

826
01:05:05,273 --> 01:05:08,375
...8- 6-7-5-3-0-9...

827
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:11,599
...8- 6-7-5-3-0-9...

828
01:05:12,954 --> 01:05:16,500
...8- 6-7-5-3-0-9...

829
01:05:24,008 --> 01:05:26,094
They killed you.
- Oops!

830
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:27,971
I'm still here, aren't I?

831
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:31,099
I mean, they did go Benihana
on my ass with that knife.

832
01:05:31,134 --> 01:05:33,080
And it should have killed me but...

833
01:05:33,185 --> 01:05:35,062
...for some reason...

834
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:36,939
...it didn't.

835
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,693
Maybe it did.

836
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:10,412
Anyway, I don't really remember
what happened after that.

837
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:13,089
I just know that I woke up and...

838
01:06:13,124 --> 01:06:15,731
...I found my way back to you.

839
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:29,704
I remember.

840
01:06:30,643 --> 01:06:33,041
I couldn't bring myself to hurt you.

841
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:35,648
I mean, I'm a really good friend.

842
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:39,298
I was just so hungry.

843
01:06:58,589 --> 01:07:00,258
Ahmet!

844
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,491
You made it out?

845
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,330
Are you lost?

846
01:07:12,146 --> 01:07:14,961
Does your host family know that
you're alive?

847
01:07:18,403 --> 01:07:20,905
Does anyone know you're alive?

848
01:07:26,745 --> 01:07:28,622
You come with me.

849
01:07:28,935 --> 01:07:30,708
We will sort this out.

850
01:07:32,585 --> 01:07:36,860
And ever since then, I just knew what
I have to do to be strong.

851
01:07:36,895 --> 01:07:40,823
And when I'm full, like I'm right now.
I'm like...

852
01:07:41,135 --> 01:07:42,595
...unkillable.

853
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:44,890
Like I can do shit like this.
Watch!

854
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:49,895
Is really cool.
Just relax. Look.

855
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:55,839
Is like some X-Men shit, right?

856
01:08:02,304 --> 01:08:05,641
What do you mean, when you're full?

857
01:08:08,874 --> 01:08:11,272
What about my mom's Kia?

858
01:08:11,481 --> 01:08:13,931
Why were you covered in blood?

859
01:08:13,966 --> 01:08:16,382
You didn't even look human.

860
01:08:19,093 --> 01:08:22,639
You know, Needy, maybe you should
talk to somebody about these...

861
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:24,794
...disturbing thoughts.

862
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:28,791
...that you're having.
We're all really concerned.

863
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,815
Especially, Chip.

864
01:08:32,128 --> 01:08:34,839
I think he may be having
second thoughts about you.

865
01:08:34,874 --> 01:08:35,882
Leave!

866
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:38,281
Come on, Needy.
Let me stay the night.

867
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:42,035
We can play 'boyfriend/girlfrienï
like we used to.

868
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,762
What are you doing?
- Um, you said to leave.

869
01:09:00,075 --> 01:09:02,161
See you at school.

870
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:32,089
We're gathered here to celebrate
the life of Collin Gray.

871
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:35,009
Who was plucked from the prime
of his youth.

872
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:50,546
<i>They did a big memorial assembly
for Collin at school.</i>

873
01:09:51,276 --> 01:09:54,248
<i>And we had to watch another
presentation about curfews...</i>

874
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:57,220
<i>... and the buddy system and
how to deal with grief.</i>

875
01:09:57,533 --> 01:10:00,036
<i>But nobody seemed to care anymore.</i>

876
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:03,373
<i>Sorrow was last week's emotion.</i>

877
01:10:05,354 --> 01:10:08,378
<i>Sure we all hope this would be
the last funeral.</i>

878
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:10,464
<i>But I knew better.</i>

879
01:10:10,985 --> 01:10:13,279
<i>So I did some research.</i>

880
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:15,782
<i>Paranormal research.</i>

890
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:26,171

the Cheesecake Factory?

891
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:30,029
Chip, I can't go to the dance
with you.

892
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:31,384

893
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:33,157

894

- Not here.

01:11:38,058 --> 01:11:40,248
Whas going on?
You're breaking up with me?

897
01:11:40,353 --> 01:11:42,438
Please, Chip.
I just need to tell you something.

898
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:43,689
Is this about Jennifer?
- Yes.

899
01:11:43,794 --> 01:11:47,035
But I promise you this is the last time...
- Needy, I care about you.

900
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:47,965
A lot.

901
01:11:48,069 --> 01:11:51,523
As a person, not just some girl
I made love to four minutes ago.

902
01:11:51,615 --> 01:11:54,013
And-And I'm scared of whas
happening to you.

903
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:58,080
You're acting really fucked up.
- Please just let me show you.

904
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,216
Okay.

905

I know.

907
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,612
No, I mean, she's actually evil.

908
01:12:08,717 --> 01:12:10,350
Not high school evil.

909
01:12:10,385 --> 01:12:14,348
I've been through the occult section
of the library five times.

910
01:12:14,383 --> 01:12:17,128
Our library has a occult section?

911
01:12:17,163 --> 01:12:19,874
Yeah, its-its really small...

912
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,273
You have to read this.

913
01:12:24,358 --> 01:12:25,822
Demon...
- Demonic transference.

914
01:12:25,857 --> 01:12:27,287
Is something that happens...

915
01:12:27,383 --> 01:12:29,677
...when you try to sacrifice
a virgin to Satan...

916
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,449
...without using an actual virgin.

917
01:12:31,484 --> 01:12:32,666
The guys from the band...

918
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:34,369
...tried to sacrifice her in the woods.

919
01:12:34,404 --> 01:12:35,203
But what they didn't know...

920
01:12:35,308 --> 01:12:37,498
...is that she hasn't been a virgin
since junior high.

921
01:12:37,533 --> 01:12:39,288
It all makes sense now.
Read this.

922
01:12:39,323 --> 01:12:41,043
If the human sacrifice is impure,

923
01:12:41,147 --> 01:12:42,259
...the result may still be obtained.

924
01:12:42,294 --> 01:12:45,110
But a demon will ever reside in the
soul of the victim.

925
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:47,926
She must forever feed on flesh
to substain the demon.

926
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,115
Okay.
- She's eating boys!

927
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,992
They like make her really...

928
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:53,140
...pretty and glowy...

929
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:55,294
...and her hair looks amazing.

930
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:58,666
And then when she's hungry,
she's weak and cranky and ugly.

931
01:12:58,701 --> 01:13:00,752
I mean like ugly for her.

932
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:03,046

01:13:03,081 --> 01:13:04,402

934

Ill be like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

935
01:13:10,867 --> 01:13:12,813
Needy, I think you need help.

936
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:14,630
Oh, my God!
You don't beleive me.

937
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:18,167
Is not that I don't believe you,
I just don't believe this.

938
01:13:18,202 --> 01:13:20,774

939
01:13:23,381 --> 01:13:25,118
And what about the dance?

940
01:13:25,153 --> 01:13:28,699
Who cares about the goddamn dance, Chip?
- I do.

941
01:13:28,803 --> 01:13:31,202
I ordered your corsage,
is an orchid.

942
01:13:31,237 --> 01:13:33,287
It was like $12.

943
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,840
I'll be at the dance.

944
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,961

945
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:43,089

946
01:13:46,114 --> 01:13:47,538

947
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:49,463

01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:34,680
Oh, you're so salty!

1041
01:20:35,515 --> 01:20:37,131
Yeah! You're...

1042
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,747
...salty too.

1043
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:40,937
Say it like you mean it.

1044
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:44,900
Say I'm better than Needy.
- What? Why?

1045
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:53,046
<i>Take my breath as your own.</i>

1046
01:20:53,138 --> 01:21:00,229
<i>Take my eyes to guide you home.</i>

1047
01:21:00,437 --> 01:21:04,191
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1048
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,641
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1049
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:11,282
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1050
01:21:11,595 --> 01:21:14,828
<i>I'm still here...</i>

1051
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,079
Chip!

1052
01:21:16,184 --> 01:21:20,042
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1053
01:21:20,077 --> 01:21:23,492
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1054
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,933
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1055
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:30,687
<i>And I'm still here so...</i>

1056
01:21:30,783 --> 01:21:34,224
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1057
01:21:34,328 --> 01:21:37,674
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1058
01:21:37,769 --> 01:21:41,315
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1059
01:21:41,732 --> 01:21:45,034
<i>And I'm still here...</i>

1060
01:21:45,069 --> 01:21:48,510
<i>Because you're not coming back.</i>

1061
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:15,727
What are you doing?
- Swimming.

1062
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:19,898
Come on, Chip.

1063
01:22:20,003 --> 01:22:22,505
Show me your breast stroke.

1064
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,190
I feel so empty.

1065
01:22:43,883 --> 01:22:45,968
Yeah, me too.

1066
01:22:48,262 --> 01:22:51,286
Please just come here and kiss me again.

1067
01:23:01,714 --> 01:23:03,383
I can't.

1068
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:06,407
I'm sorry.

1069
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,805
This just feels weird.

1070
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:50,934
Help!

1071
01:24:18,464 --> 01:24:20,237
Needy.

1072
01:24:49,852 --> 01:24:51,625
Needy.

1073
01:25:16,548 --> 01:25:18,216
She can fly?

1074
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:19,885
She's just hovering.

1075
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:20,927
Is not that impressive.

1076
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,681
God, do you have to undermine
everything that I do?

1077
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,184
You're such a player-hater.

1078
01:25:27,393 --> 01:25:28,861
You're a jerk.

1079
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,981
Wow! Nice insult, Hannah Montana!

1080
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:33,545
You got any more harsh digs?

1081
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:35,318
You know what?

1082
01:25:35,526 --> 01:25:37,681
You were never a good friend.

1083
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:40,540
Even when we were little.
You used to steal my toys...

1084
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:44,912
...pour lemonade on my bed.
- And now I'm eating your boyfriend!

1085
01:25:44,947 --> 01:25:47,745
See, atleast I'm consistent.

1086
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,543
Why do you need him? Huh?

1087
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:53,263
You could have anybody,
you think want, Jennifer.

1088
01:25:53,358 --> 01:25:56,243
So... why Chip?

1089
01:25:56,278 --> 01:25:58,746
Is it just to piss me off?

1090
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:02,639
Or is it because you're just really insecure?

1091
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:05,455
I'm not insecure, Needy.

1092
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:06,297
God, thas a joke!

1093
01:26:06,393 --> 01:26:10,564
How can I ever be insecure?
I was the Snowflake Queen!

1094
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:11,989
Yeah...

1095
01:26:12,024 --> 01:26:14,736
...two years ago.
When you were socially relevant.

1096
01:26:14,771 --> 01:26:16,578
I'm still socially relevant.

1097
01:26:16,613 --> 01:26:20,471
And when you didn't need laxatives
to stay skinny.

1098
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,858
I'm going...

1099
01:26:25,893 --> 01:26:28,257
...to eat your soul...

1100
01:26:28,292 --> 01:26:31,629
...and shit it out, Lesnicki.

1101
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:33,714
I thought you only murdered boys.

1102
01:26:33,749 --> 01:26:35,591
I go both ways.

1103
01:27:05,415 --> 01:27:07,501
Do you have a tampon?

1104
01:27:10,421 --> 01:27:12,194
Thought I'd ask.

1105
01:27:12,819 --> 01:27:15,322
You seemed like you might be plugging.

1106
01:27:36,491 --> 01:27:38,576
Oh, Chip!

1107
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:41,496
Needy.

1108
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:45,042
I should have believed you.

1109
01:27:46,606 --> 01:27:47,857
I'm sorry.

1110
01:27:47,961 --> 01:27:51,715
No, no! Listen to me! Listen to me!
I'll dial & get some help, okay?

1111
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,322
Okay?
Yeah, okay.

1112
01:28:01,413 --> 01:28:03,499
Is not working.

1113
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:06,801
Come on.

1114
01:28:06,836 --> 01:28:08,922
Needy. Needy.

1115
01:28:10,381 --> 01:28:11,911
I'm going somewhere.

1116
01:28:11,946 --> 01:28:13,823
No! No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

1117
01:28:13,858 --> 01:28:15,595
Yes, I'm!

1118
01:28:15,908 --> 01:28:18,567
I think I already died before you got here,

1119
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:21,226
...but I woke up when I heard your voice.

1120
01:28:23,729 --> 01:28:25,815
I love you.

1121
01:28:29,569 --> 01:28:31,759
I love you too.

1122
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:38,850
And you look totally hot in that dress.

1123
01:28:38,954 --> 01:28:41,874
Oh, God!
You're clearly delirious.

1124
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,794
No, I'm not.

1125
01:28:50,112 --> 01:28:51,259
Chip?

1126
01:28:51,468 --> 01:28:53,240
No!

1127
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:55,847
No-o-o!

1128
01:29:00,853 --> 01:29:02,938
No!

1129
01:30:18,645 --> 01:30:21,148
Best friends forever, huh?

1130
01:30:21,982 --> 01:30:24,033
You killed my fucking boyfriend!

1131
01:30:24,068 --> 01:30:28,030
You goddamned monster!
You... Zombitch!

1132
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:37,937
You know what this is for?

1133
01:30:39,605 --> 01:30:41,895
Is for cutting boxes.

1134
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:46,696
Do you buy all your murder weapons
at Home Depot?

1135
01:30:46,731 --> 01:30:48,782
God, you're butch.

1136
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:53,579
Cross out Jennifer!

1137
01:32:09,286 --> 01:32:11,371
My tit!

1138
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:15,125
No...

1139
01:32:15,334 --> 01:32:17,107
...your heart.

1140
01:32:38,067 --> 01:32:40,674
Oh, Jennifer!
Whas is it, baby?

1141
01:32:43,385 --> 01:32:45,471
Needy?

1142
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:48,286
Oh, my God!

1143
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:50,997
Oh, my God!

1144
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:57,254
Oh, my God!

1145
01:33:14,356 --> 01:33:17,589
<i>I don't know who Needy Lesnicki
is anymore.</i>

1146
01:33:27,495 --> 01:33:29,268
<i>I'm a different person now.</i>

1147
01:33:29,476 --> 01:33:31,423
<i>A person who uses curse words...</i>

1148
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:34,690
<i>... and kicks orderlies and sees things
that aren't there.</i>

1149
01:33:34,725 --> 01:33:37,610
<i>A very bad, very damaged person.</i>

1150
01:33:38,132 --> 01:33:40,634
<i>But sometimes, change can be good.</i>

1151
01:33:40,843 --> 01:33:43,346
<i>For instance, most occult scholars
don't know this...</i>

1152
01:33:43,381 --> 01:33:45,327
<i>... but if you're bitten by a demon...</i>

1153
01:33:45,431 --> 01:33:46,787
<i>... and you live...</i>

1154
01:33:46,995 --> 01:33:50,020
<i>... you just might absorb some of
the demon's abilities.</i>

1155
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:53,461
<i>You just might get lucky for once
in your miserable life.</i>

1156
01:35:15,633 --> 01:35:20,013
Where you looking to go, young lady?
- East, towards Madisson.

1157
01:35:20,847 --> 01:35:22,933
Hop in my chariot.

1158
01:35:29,919 --> 01:35:32,005
So why you headed East?

1159
01:35:32,943 --> 01:35:35,029
I'm following this rock band.

1160
01:35:36,802 --> 01:35:38,887
Must be one in hell of a group.

1161
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,703
Tonighs gonna be their last show.

1162
01:35:43,058 --> 01:35:45,144
<b>"Violet"
performed by Hole</b>

1163
01:35:45,874 --> 01:35:49,211
<i>And the sky was made of amethyst.</i>

1164
01:35:51,297 --> 01:35:55,259
<i>And all the stars look just like little fish.</i>

1165
01:35:57,032 --> 01:36:00,577
<i>You should learn when to go.</i>

1166
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:06,626
<i>You should learn how to say no.</i>

1167
01:36:08,711 --> 01:36:11,631
<i>Might last a day, yeah-h-h!</i>

1168
01:36:11,944 --> 01:36:14,029
<i>Mine is forever.</i>

1169
01:36:14,342 --> 01:36:18,722
<i>Might last a day, yeah-h-h!</i>

1170
01:36:20,599 --> 01:36:22,650
<i>Well, mine is forever.</i>

1171
01:36:22,685 --> 01:36:28,429
<i>When they get what they want,
they never want it again.</i>

1172
01:36:28,524 --> 01:36:34,164
<i>When they get what they want,
they never want it again.</i>

1173
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:39,595
<i>Go on, take everything,
take everything I want you to.</i>

1174
01:36:39,682 --> 01:36:46,786
<i>Go on, take everything,
take everything I want you to.</i>

1175
01:36:46,877 --> 01:36:48,963
Hey, look at this motherfucker.

1176
01:36:49,693 --> 01:36:51,466
Go open the door.
