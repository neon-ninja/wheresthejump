00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:42,450
Many moons ago on
the distant planet of Gigax,

3
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:45,520
a nameless evil
reigned supreme.

4
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:48,925
This ruthless being
had amassed power beyond measure

5
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,693
and was preparing to strike down
all that was good

6
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:54,096
and just in the universe.

7
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,933
Before he could fulfill
his dark destiny,

8
00:00:56,966 --> 00:01:00,402
the forces of light
banded together,

9
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,671
and in their most desperate hour

10
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:04,773
toppled the dark one
from his throne.

11
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:08,476
He was imprisoned in a place
far beyond reach,

12
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,813
for if he were ever
to be released,

13
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:15,717
it would spell certain doom
for all existence.

14
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:26,095
Okay, here's the deal, men.
Winner is champion of

15
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,131
the universe,
loser gets buried alive.

16
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,399
Got it?

17
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,701
That's fair.

18
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,837
- Ready?
- Set?

19
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:36,538
- Crazy Ball!
- Crazy Ball!

20
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:42,778
You're toast, Mimi.

21
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:45,848
Not even close, you dork!

22
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:48,918
Ow, my butt!

23
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:51,519
Yes, five point butt bonus.

24
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:53,189
Swing ball.

25
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:54,522
One...

26
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:55,657
Crazy ball.

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,193
- Two...
- Crazy ball.

28
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,661
- Three.
- Three of a kind!

29
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:02,198
Four, alright,
four points for me.

30
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:04,466
I'll get you at
the switcheroo, crumb scum.

31
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,135
Just you watch.

32
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,770
Buckle up for a dirt sandwich,
you little maniac.

33
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:10,206
Aaaah!

34
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:22,184
Switcheroo. Aaah!

35
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:23,718
I win!

36
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:26,554
Start digging, Luke.

37
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,627
Damn switcheroo.

38
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:34,931
Keep digging, boy.

39
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:39,101
Hey, hurry up so I can bury you
and go to sleep already.

40
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:41,536
I'm gonna bring your bed
into my room

41
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,673
and make one of those,
oh, what do you call it.

42
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,809
Oh, super beds.

43
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:50,612
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

44
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:04,659
Is that a coffin?

45
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:06,594
Is this where
they buried Grandma?

46
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:08,730
No, I don't think so.

47
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,666
Let me see.

48
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,506
It's really stuck in there good.

49
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,676
Maybe if I press those,
it'll do something?

50
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,648
No, I'm the Crazy Ball champion
so I get all the treasures.

51
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,918
Right, of course.

52
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,719
Let's see.

53
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,922
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

54
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,257
Dumb dumb chump, here we go.

55
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:40,196
Wow, first try.

56
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,696
Come to mama.

57
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,279
Cover it up!

58
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:00,116
Hurry, before mom and dad see.

59
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:01,716
Shovel faster, numnuts.

60
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,253
I'm trying.

61
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:17,166
Luke, Mimi, do you kids
know what time it is?

62
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,334
- 9:00.
- 9:00.

63
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,337
What happens at 9:00.

64
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,140
Get inside.
It's time for bed.

65
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,686
Dad?

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,222
You okay, sport?

67
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:42,858
Is there such thing
as monsters?

68
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,897
Well, here's the thing, Luke.

69
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,133
In a lot of ways,
humans are the real monsters.

70
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,802
So I'd say yes.

71
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:56,671
Okay, what your genius father
is trying to say is no,

72
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:59,141
there's no such thing
as monsters.

73
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,609
What happened to your head?

74
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:05,881
Somebody lost at Crazy Ball.

75
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:07,615
Again?

76
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,385
Mimi, I don't want to keep
going through this, okay?

77
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,188
Remember what we said last time
you were playing kookie ball?

78
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,290
It's Crazy Ball!

79
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:16,826
Plus, it's not even my fault.

80
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,727
Check the tapes. Luke sucks.

81
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,230
It doesn't matter, okay?

82
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,832
You need to take it easy
on your brother.

83
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,300
He won't want to play
with you anymore.

84
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,868
What's the deal
with monsters?

85
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,371
Are they fake? Are they real?
All the above?

86
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,241
Yeah, what's with all
the monster talk tonight?

87
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:34,777
It's just that, if there
are monsters coming to kill us,

88
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,712
could you make sure they...

89
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:39,849
could you make sure
they kill Luke first?

90
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,319
That's harsh.
But okay.

91
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,955
Mimi, that's
a horrible thing to say.

92
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,324
Why?!

93
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,159
Dismissed.

94
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,694
Good night, wacko.

95
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,232
Dad!

96
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,805
Good night.

97
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,946
Look at this shit!
There's not a pawn shop in town

98
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,848
that's going to want this crap!

99
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:22,384
If it's all garbage,
why did that old guy put up

100
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:24,386
such a fight when we busted in?

101
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,856
I think I sprained my wrist
clocking that geezer.

102
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,760
Look at this. Why the hell
would you even grab this?

103
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:35,497
Suck my dick, asshole!
It was dark.

104
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,533
And that's a nice frame.

105
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:40,436
Not any more.

106
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,316
What the hell did
you say, buddy?

107
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,291
A variation
of the Ironian tongue.

108
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:04,927
How primitive.

109
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,398
Let's just get out of here!
This guy's on something.

110
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,867
Hey, you dickless shit.

111
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,535
We already killed
one asshole tonight.

112
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:16,538
And we'll gladly do it again!

113
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,955
Your flesh is unevolved
and weak.

114
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:38,260
Perhaps in a few millennia, you
will make worthy adversaries.

115
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:42,431
But not today.

116
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:11,427
Hey, man, please,
I don't want to die.

117
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,463
Then live forever.

118
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,385
This is a really big hole.

119
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,887
How did you even dig this?
Huh?

120
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:43,025
Alright, first I want to say,
great job on the hole, son.

121
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:45,194
- Thanks.
- Second I want to say,

122
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:46,528
this is completely unacceptable.

123
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:48,230
- Oh.
- Somebody's going to

124
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:51,500
have to fill this in.

125
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:54,269
Anybody.

126
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,405
One of you even.

127
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:58,440
- I vote dad.
- Me too.

128
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,409
Yeah, me three.

129
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,345
And if I... when I vote,
I will vote for all of

130
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,281
- you three, as a family.
- No, no.

131
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,583
Doesn't work that way.

132
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:11,653
Alright.
So much for democracy, huh?

133
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,423
Do the dishes, Greg.

134
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,024
What made these?

135
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,026
If I had to guess,
I'd say some wino

136
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,695
was on his way home
from a bender last night.

137
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,430
Thought he could Evel Knievel

138
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:23,999
his way over this hole
and fell in.

139
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:28,437
- What else could it be really?
- Maybe a raccoon.

140
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,205
That doesn't make
any damn sense.

141
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:34,443
Oh!
Oh, oh, my hand.

142
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:36,311
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God, my hand.

143
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,447
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Oh, it hurts so bad, Susan!

144
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,382
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

145
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,317
- Come on.
- Oh, Susan.

146
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,255
Ow! Don't even look
at it, it hurts.

147
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:58,500
Did you see the size
of those freaking claw marks?

148
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,370
We need to tell
somebody what happened.

149
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:02,638
Maybe we should
go to the police.

150
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,307
I don't trust cops.
Not one bit.

151
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,377
We're going to go search
ourselves tonight.

152
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,711
That's crazy.

153
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,647
We don't know
what was down there.

154
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,417
What's crazy is what a stupid
wiener you can be some times.

155
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:18,320
Pull up your diapers
because we're going to go find

156
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:20,622
what crawled out
of your grave last night

157
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:24,460
like a couple of real
American heroes.

158
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,530
Can you dig it?!

159
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,433
Yeah. I dig it.

160
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:35,504
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Alistair.

161
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:37,706
You beat Rage Master 64 yet?

162
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,209
Yeah, man, medium difficulty.

163
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,510
- No way.
- Hey, kiddy.

164
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:44,246
You look good in your
little outfit there.

165
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,582
Why don't you give us
a spin, hunky boy?

166
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:49,351
Um, no thanks.

167
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:51,788
Never mind.

168
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:54,456
My math!

169
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,759
Is your sister crazy?

170
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,609
Mimi, look.

171
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,345
That way.

172
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:23,352
There's no way
this was a dirty wino bum.

173
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:25,621
Look at how even
his footsteps are.

174
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:29,525
Duh. When has dad ever
been right about anything?

175
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:32,761
Yeah, good point.

176
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:42,771
I'm not going in there.

177
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,673
Here, take this.

178
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:46,775
I call it the Luke killer.

179
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,577
It will protect you.

180
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,445
How the hell
does this work?

181
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,348
Ow! The damn thing cut me.

182
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:54,750
You're using it wrong.

183
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:58,320
Don't kill her Mark.
I'm going to kill you.

184
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:02,224
Mimi, wait. Oh, crap.

185
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,415
Stop jumping at everything!

186
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,616
You're jumping, too.

187
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,252
I'm jumping because
you're jumping!

188
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:31,788
This place is dangerous.

189
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,891
Didn't somebody die back
when this was a shoe factory?

190
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:38,594
Nobody ever died
from making shoes, Luke.

191
00:13:38,627 --> 00:13:40,596
That's just crazy.

192
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,733
Besides, the most dangerous
thing in here...

193
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,269
is me.

194
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,739
We should get out of here.

195
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:55,377
Hey, creep!
We know you're in here.

196
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,413
Show yourself or...

197
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:02,351
or I'll break you
into a pile of bones?

198
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,686
No, that wasn't good.

199
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,323
This is super dumb.

200
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,525
Let's go.

201
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:21,570
Is that fear I smell?
How sweet.

202
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,509
Oh, my God.

203
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:31,446
Man, that's what
this one called me.

204
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,648
Aah!

205
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:35,317
Are you also man?

206
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,686
You are much smaller creatures.

207
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,755
No matter.

208
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:42,491
You will suffer like the rest.

209
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:45,560
Know that in the sweet
release of death

210
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,629
you'll be spared
the sight of your planet

211
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:51,533
being torn to pieces,
watching as everyone

212
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,536
you hold dear is drowned
in a sea of their own blood.

213
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:56,304
Shut it!

214
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,473
No, I am not a man.

215
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,409
I am a wo-man.

216
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:04,713
And you're going to let go of
my stupid wiener bro right now!

217
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,519
Mimi, look.

218
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:22,364
Is this yours?

219
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:24,801
Speak.

220
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,837
The gem of Praxidice.

221
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,504
This cannot be.

222
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:32,507
Believe it, buster.

223
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,644
Stop messing around
and explain, scum.

224
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:48,390
The Geminia One, whoever wields
it is able to command me

225
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:50,659
for as long as it's
in their possession.

226
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,494
But know this, child.

227
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:55,297
The power you wield
will be short lived.

228
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,768
Sure, sure. But first let's
test this baby out.

229
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,670
Alright, Monster Mash.

230
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:06,775
Pick up my bro and, uh,
spin him around a bunch.

231
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:09,711
Hey, come on.

232
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:11,646
Ah.

233
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,784
It hurts.

234
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:17,319
Alright, put the cry baby down.

235
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:23,358
Enough! The longer we play
these childish games,

236
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:26,628
the more horrifying
your deaths will be.

237
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:30,565
This is but a small example
of what I am capable of.

238
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,634
His eternal pain
will take his mind

239
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,704
beyond the furthest
reaches of madness.

240
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:39,809
Preserved in an endless
state of... no!

241
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:42,845
He was my masterpiece!

242
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,782
Oh, sorry man.

243
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:48,383
Thank you.

244
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,386
Do you have a name,
Monster Man?

245
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,924
No name can encompass
my dark will.

246
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:57,526
Though my enemies
will sometimes refer to me

247
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,797
as the arch duke of nightmares.

248
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,764
Well, that sucks.

249
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,766
Never mind.
We can workshop this.

250
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:08,503
Luke!

251
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:10,672
- Yeah?
- I want names.

252
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:13,075
They've got to be fresh,
they've got to be cool.

253
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,643
Go.

254
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:17,546
We can't name it.
He's going to kill us.

255
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,749
Ha! You would pray
for something so simple.

256
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:23,853
I will drink your
endless screams as I rip...

257
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:26,923
Dinosaur-us Flex.

258
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:29,624
That's not bad actually.

259
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:32,594
- Rexothundrax?
- Cobrala Khan.

260
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,596
Revenge X Bad Lord.

261
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:36,531
- Heartless Creep.
- Oh, Rip Lord.

262
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:41,369
How about Shadow Slammer?
Or even Merman.

263
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:42,872
Nemesis Grim Night.

264
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,807
No, too sinister.

265
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,642
How about Dark Lord
of Wonderful Smooches?

266
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:51,147
I will never accept
such a title.

267
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,381
Stop running
and clap your hands,

268
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:55,818
you know, for a while at least.

269
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,823
How about Psycho Man?

270
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:03,758
Mm, Goreman?

271
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:06,428
That's it.

272
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:09,598
Did I get it?

273
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,733
No.

274
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:14,871
Stop that annoying clapping!

275
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:18,473
His name will be...

276
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:21,443
Psycho Goreman!

277
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:24,947
Or PG for short.

278
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,416
I don't see how that's better
than Archduke of Nightmares.

279
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,153
Psycho Goreman, that's great.

280
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:34,090
It's fun, it's hip,
it's wow, and it's now.

281
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:36,424
You're making
a terrible mistake,

282
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,127
you putrid little creature.

283
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,663
Soon I'll get the gem back,
and when I do...

284
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:43,900
Nice to meet you, PG.
I'm Mimi.

285
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,667
And I'm Luke.

286
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,570
Aaah! I wield powers
unimaginable

287
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:49,906
to your simple minds.

288
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,674
Soon you will beg me
for mercy.

289
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,778
But know that you will
only receive pain.

290
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,813
Knock knock?

291
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,216
What?

292
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:01,650
Knock knock?

293
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,518
Have you succumbed
to madness already?

294
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,221
Just say "who's there" already.

295
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:07,756
Geez, what planet are you from?

296
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,793
Gigax.

297
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,494
Who's there?

298
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,764
Me. Crazy Ball champion
of the universe.

299
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:19,634
And the champion says...

300
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,470
go over there,
sit down, shut up,

301
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:23,940
and wait for us
to come back in the morning.

302
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,640
You dig?

303
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:28,210
Dig what?

304
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:30,212
Go!

305
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,857
You will suffer in eternity
for this!

306
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,193
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,595
Bye-e-e-e-e-e!

308
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,877
I wonder what
it's favorite shows are.

309
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:05,114
Do you think it likes
grilled cheeses and tacos?

310
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,816
We should bring him
some welcome goodies

311
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,683
before we take him out
on the town.

312
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:10,719
What do you mean
take him out on the town?

313
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,221
I got to show him off.

314
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,856
I'll be the coolest kid
in school.

315
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,225
He's going to kill everybody
if we take him anywhere.

316
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,795
No, he won't.
Not unless I tell him to.

317
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:22,965
Mimi, I'm pretty good at going
along with your crazy ideas.

318
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:25,868
But we need to think
about this one.

319
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:29,839
Fine. I should probably teach
him some cool tricks anyways.

320
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:33,209
See what kind of slick stuff
he can do.

321
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:41,784
Watch out, world,
it's Mimi's time to shine.

322
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:04,306
The vasiaults have analyzed
the cosmic resonance

323
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,176
and confirmed our suspicions.

324
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,577
The ultimate evil has awoken.

325
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:11,781
How can this be possible?

326
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,849
Who could have deciphered
the sequence

327
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:16,919
that released
the gem of Praxidice?

328
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:19,288
I approved
the sequence myself.

329
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,623
Whoever solved it
must have intelligence

330
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,926
that far surpasses our own.

331
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:28,230
Which is a notion that I find
quite preposterous, I must say.

332
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:32,935
- Preposterous?
- That's right.

333
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:35,337
Enough!

334
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:38,240
Our mistake was being merciful
to that demon

335
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:41,343
instead of wiping him
from the galaxy forever.

336
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:44,246
It is clear that the rules
of the Gigaxian unity accords

337
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,182
have failed us.

338
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:49,151
What do you suggest
we do, Templar Pandora?

339
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:58,227
It's time to elect justice
through the Templar code.

340
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,831
There will be no trial
for that abomination.

341
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:06,634
The only verdict is for him
to die by my hand.

342
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:09,238
He has single handedly
extinguished entire planets

343
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:10,840
from existence.

344
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,909
How do you expect to
defeat him on your own, hm?

345
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:16,946
I do not fear him.

346
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:21,917
I have faith that the gods
will watch over and protect me.

347
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,158
Ooh, sounds like a load
of superstitious nonsense to me.

348
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,361
What was that?

349
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,363
- Huh?
- Huh?

350
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,664
No, no, no.
I didn't say anything.

351
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:38,968
- You don't believe me?
- I believe you, Templar.

352
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,735
It's just, we're boys
having a laugh.

353
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,238
And...

354
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:44,874
- Just a bit of...
- Just what?

355
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:48,844
I think it's an excellent plan
so why don't we just move on?

356
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,846
Lots of things
to discuss here.

357
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,249
Aah!

358
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:56,886
Do you not believe that it is
my destiny to vanquish

359
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,389
this darkness from the universe?

360
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:04,360
I... would leave...

361
00:23:07,963 --> 00:23:10,866
Never forget that it was we,
the Templars,

362
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,403
that cleansed your worlds
of the dark one's scourge.

363
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,972
It was the will of the gods
that saved you,

364
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:21,743
and they can just as easily have
you all wiped from existence.

365
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,979
Remember this.

366
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:26,448
Yes, you're very kind.

367
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:29,818
What are the creatures
of this planet?

368
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:32,855
Humans, your holiness.

369
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:36,792
Bring me one of these
human things.

370
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:44,900
- Where am I?
- Come here, my dear.

371
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:48,404
Don't be afraid.

372
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,885
He will not escape us this time.

373
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:09,358
The light of heaven will always
extinguish the darkness of evil.

374
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,940
May the gods watch over me.

375
00:24:37,987 --> 00:24:40,422
And the president said,

376
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:42,524
"But, Mimi, every day's
your birthday."

377
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:44,827
Then we started eating
the whole cake

378
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,563
while they broadcasted
it to the whole world.

379
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:49,565
And that's when I woke up.

380
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,267
Which really sucked because

381
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,270
I wanted to finish
that tasty cake.

382
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:59,174
Okay, so who's this
guy you have got living

383
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,876
in the old shoe factory?

384
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:02,878
You're going to
love him, Alistair.

385
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:07,416
He's this big scary monster
that wants to kill everybody.

386
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:08,984
Huh?

387
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:11,887
Hey, could one of you guys
help me with this?

388
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,822
No, thanks.

389
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:25,200
Holy crud.

390
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,403
I know, right?

391
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:30,806
PG, wake up!

392
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:41,450
PG, wake up. I want you
to meet our friend, Alistair.

393
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:47,489
Wait, were we supposed
to feed him?

394
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,194
You alive, buddy?

395
00:25:57,032 --> 00:25:58,267
Aaah!

396
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,602
Stop!

397
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,906
Nice try.

398
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,542
Anyways, Alistair,
this is Psycho Goreman.

399
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,344
Or PG for short.

400
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:12,014
- Hi.
- Silence!

401
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:13,515
Okay.

402
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:15,951
We've brought you
some reading material, PG.

403
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:18,420
And a TV to watch.
Did you sleep okay?

404
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:20,889
I'm sorry we didn't
bring any pornos.

405
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,591
Petty displays of wealth.

406
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,661
How can your short life spans
allow such narcissism?

407
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:28,030
Yeah, but look
at all the hunky boys.

408
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:31,467
I do not care for hunky boys.

409
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:39,908
Or do I?

410
00:26:39,942 --> 00:26:42,511
PG, can I ask you something?

411
00:26:42,544 --> 00:26:44,012
No!

412
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:46,548
PG, I don't like that attitude.

413
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:50,052
Be nice, please.
Luke, ask him again.

414
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:53,555
Can I ask you something?

415
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,357
What?

416
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:57,926
What are you?

417
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:11,340
That is a tale bathed
in the blood

418
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:13,642
of a million dead memories.

419
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:24,219
I was born in a time before
time, on the planet Gigax.

420
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:26,622
A world light years
from your own.

421
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:29,425
My entire existence
was servitude,

422
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:33,228
under the rule of beings that
claimed to serve a higher power

423
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,330
that governed over us all.

424
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:38,634
These entities,
known as the Templars,

425
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,502
had no more divine purpose

426
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:43,705
than the dirt I excavated
to help build their churches.

427
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:47,309
But still they were able
to crush the people of Gigax

428
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:49,711
beneath their gilded heels.

429
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:52,714
The Templars preached to us
their holy scriptures,

430
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:56,418
declaring their
rightful ownership of Gigax.

431
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:59,455
To them, we were nothing
more than parasites

432
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:01,690
trespassing on hallowed ground.

433
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:08,464
That candy was weird.

434
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:19,408
But then one day
every thing changed.

435
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:38,327
I discovered an artifact
thought to be lost forever,

436
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,331
forged by ancient
Gigaxian warlocks out of energy

437
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:44,633
from the darkest corners
of the galaxy...

438
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,436
the gem of Praxidice.

439
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,722
The moment I took
the gem in my hand

440
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:11,493
and felt its immense power,
my destiny was clear.

441
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:14,229
I would destroy the Templars

442
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:18,567
and anyone else
that stood against me.

443
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:49,866
The gem bonded with me

444
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:53,569
and gave me power
beyond all other beings.

445
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:57,506
I was able to raise an army
led by my loyal generals,

446
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:02,711
the Paladins of Sydion,
and take back Gigax.

447
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:05,882
But I didn't stop there.

448
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:08,717
It was clear that my thirst
for death would only be

449
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,690
satiated if I snuffed out
all light in the universe.

450
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:20,830
But I was overthrown
and imprisoned

451
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:24,766
by the Templars
and their planetary alliance.

452
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:29,638
They stole the gem
and, with it, my power.

453
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:53,830
To this day, I do not understand
how such weak minded insects

454
00:30:53,863 --> 00:30:58,500
could defeat the greatest
power in the galaxy.

455
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,403
TV's working.

456
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:06,341
Well, that boring dumb story
made me tired.

457
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,509
Let's go, guys.

458
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:10,479
PG, your homework
is to watch more TV

459
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,314
and learn how to be more fun.

460
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:14,383
Otherwise...

461
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,485
I will have to punish you.

462
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:18,720
Well, it was nice meeting you.

463
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:22,290
It would nicer if you were dead.

464
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:23,759
Alright, bye.

465
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,344
Energy runs through this box.

466
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:48,283
It might be enough.

467
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:52,287
Spirits of the electroverse,
find my world and alert

468
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,591
the Paladins of Sydion
that their master walks again.

469
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,331
The gem of Praxidice
has been taken

470
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,367
by two brainless meat children.

471
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,537
You must attain the gem
even if it has to be pried

472
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,807
from their tiny dead hands.

473
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,344
Thanks for
having me to stay over

474
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:17,713
for dinner, Mrs. Hallenbeck.

475
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:19,314
Glad to have you, Alistair.

476
00:32:19,347 --> 00:32:21,650
Yes, very glad to have you.

477
00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:23,886
Well, I was busy filling
in that hole in the backyard,

478
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,822
so unfortunately, Mr. Hallenbeck

479
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:29,324
had the pleasure
of playing master chef tonight.

480
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:31,359
How great is
this chicken, Alistair?

481
00:32:31,393 --> 00:32:32,627
It's my special recipe.

482
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:35,764
It's, uh...

483
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:37,532
It's a little tough, Dad.

484
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:38,868
The microwave will do that.

485
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:40,837
But it sure brings
out the flavor.

486
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,805
What did you three maniacs
get up to?

487
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,607
We, um... Ow!

488
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,409
We were playing
guns in the forest.

489
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:49,879
Guns?
Now that sounds like fun.

490
00:32:49,912 --> 00:32:53,348
Back when I was in the army, we
used to play guns all the time.

491
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:55,417
Except it was called
the Iraq War.

492
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,720
We played for keeps.

493
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:00,388
Meaning I killed people.

494
00:33:00,422 --> 00:33:02,457
Okay, don't listen to GI Joker
over here.

495
00:33:02,491 --> 00:33:05,862
He's never fired
a gun in his life.

496
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:07,596
- Anyways...
- Can me and Alistair

497
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:09,431
play video games?

498
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:11,834
Mm-hmm. Just put your plates
by the sink, okay, honey?

499
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:14,703
But, Alistair,
games are for nerds.

500
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:16,371
Wouldn't you rather go
in the driveway

501
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:19,508
and throw basketballs
at Luke or something?

502
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,610
Oh, uh, yeah, thanks.

503
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:25,580
But I just really want
to play some vids.

504
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,516
Come on, let's go.

505
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,355
Guess I'll play by myself then.

506
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,323
Hey, Mimi.

507
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,325
Can you come back
and finish your broccoli?

508
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,762
No, I cannot, because champions
don't eat broccoli!

509
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:44,100
Well, she finished
my delicious chicken.

510
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:48,770
And in the end, isn't that
all that really matters?

511
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,339
No, she didn't.

512
00:34:00,783 --> 00:34:03,886
And then I heard Kyle
put all his pubes in a bag

513
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,655
and sold them to Mason
for five bucks.

514
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:08,390
Isn't that crazy?

515
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:11,093
Dude, what's he going to do
with a bag of pubes?

516
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:16,598
What the frig are you doing?

517
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:18,100
- But...
- Took you long enough.

518
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:19,836
I don't have all night.

519
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,139
Time is a false construct that
only exists for

520
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:27,776
primitive beings unable to phase
into the ninth dimension.

521
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,579
Also I got lost.

522
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:34,382
Mimi, what the heck
are you doing?

523
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,617
He can't be here.

524
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,386
He can be wherever
I want him to be.

525
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,621
Remember?

526
00:34:39,654 --> 00:34:42,091
Heads up, dumpy butt.

527
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:46,528
Bulls eye!

528
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:48,865
This reminds me of
an ancient torture technique

529
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:52,935
I learned from the worms
of Janus many moons ago.

530
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:56,138
Should I go?

531
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:58,140
This is getting a little weird.

532
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:01,676
Those were good people,
those worms.

533
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,915
I don't care about
your stupid ancient techniques.

534
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:09,819
Unless they can make Alistair
stop being such a freaking dork.

535
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:14,489
I once used my dark magic
to help the warlord of Zatonia

536
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,792
seduce the moon princess.

537
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:20,830
I can do the same
for you if you wish.

538
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:25,600
You can make him want
to chuck basketballs with me.

539
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:29,771
Alright, I'm going to bounce.
Good night, everybody.

540
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:31,473
Do it.

541
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:34,542
So be it.

542
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:37,612
Your wish is my command.

543
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,217
Oh, Jesus!

544
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,553
Greg, what did you do
to the microwave?

545
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:48,124
Cooked a great meal
for my family, that's what.

546
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:49,591
You're welcome.

547
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:52,694
It's totally wrecked.

548
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:55,131
You're welcome.

549
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:02,737
That's great.

550
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,841
Oh, my God.

551
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:07,944
Oh, my God.

552
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:18,187
What did you do to him?

553
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,790
Get away from my kids!

554
00:36:25,593 --> 00:36:27,930
My lucky bat!

555
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:30,166
Come on!

556
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,969
Greg, what the hell
are you doing?

557
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:34,837
Aaah!

558
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,573
You dare stand against me with
such a weak excuse for a weapon?

559
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:40,209
No, I didn't. She did. She did.

560
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:41,743
You asshole!

561
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:45,680
Don't hurt my parents.
That's an order.

562
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:51,153
Um, Mom, dad, I want you to meet
my new best pal,

563
00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:54,156
Psycho Goreman,
or PG for short.

564
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,793
I don't care what his name is,
you need to call the police.

565
00:36:57,827 --> 00:36:59,295
Are you kidding me?

566
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:01,696
What's a cop going to do
against this thing?

567
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,966
- Is he going to kill us?
- No way.

568
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,901
PG's a big softy.

569
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:09,905
He wouldn't hurt anybody.
Right, buddy?

570
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,976
My entire existence is built
on death and destruction.

571
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,245
I will kill you both.

572
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,747
No, no, no, no.
No, you won't.

573
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:22,918
PG's just being a goof.
He's family now. Don't worry.

574
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:24,619
Be worried.

575
00:37:24,652 --> 00:37:26,755
When I'm free of
your daughter's control,

576
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:28,924
I will bath in your blood.

577
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:32,694
Ha!
PG, you're such a whack job!

578
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:39,601
I will kill you.

579
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:42,204
I will kill you.

580
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:45,174
I will kill you.

What the fuck, man?

601
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:47,796
So tomorrow
we've got a tight schedule.

602
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,466
We're bowling at 10:00,
and then a light picnic brunch,

603
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:52,168
which we'll have to have
around noon

604
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:54,303
so that Mom can take us
to the grocery store.

605
00:39:54,336 --> 00:39:56,438
I've set aside
four hours for baking

606
00:39:56,472 --> 00:40:01,443
so hopefully that's enough time
to bake all 12 cakes.

607
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:16,158
Wow.

608
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,328
I wish my face could do that.

609
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:21,163
What do you eat
back at home, PG?

610
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:24,934
Food is not only for
sustenance back on Gigax.

611
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:27,002
It's part of an honor code.

612
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:31,941
To be eaten is considered
a warriors death.

613
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:37,246
I remember during the battle
on the Bridge of Souls.

614
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,916
I've got it.
Here's the new plan.

615
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,319
Six hours for baking,

616
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:47,356
and we push upside down karaoke
to Sunday.

617
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:48,924
Boom!

618
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:51,794
Does that...
Of course it does.

619
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:56,398
Case closed. Judge Mimi will
return after these messages.

620
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:01,470
Don't mind if I do.

621
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,806
I was going to eat those.

622
00:41:06,242 --> 00:41:08,177
I think you've
had enough, fatso.

623
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,546
Champion's got to eat.

624
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:12,915
So good.

625
00:42:07,336 --> 00:42:11,206
Hello, boy.

626
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,908
What is happening right now?

627
00:42:12,941 --> 00:42:14,910
You have crossed
the dream barrier

628
00:42:14,943 --> 00:42:17,946
and are traversing
the nightmare realm.

629
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,018
It is here where I am able to
communicate with your privately.

630
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:26,522
Hidden in your dark thoughts.

631
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:29,024
What do you want?

632
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:31,927
You know what I want.

633
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:35,364
The gem.

634
00:42:35,397 --> 00:42:38,567
This sick game
must come to an end.

635
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,603
Get it for me
so that I can be free.

636
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:43,505
I can't do that.

637
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,474
Mimi found the gem.

638
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:47,409
It belongs to her now.

639
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:49,978
Finders keepers, that's the law.

640
00:42:50,012 --> 00:42:53,282
How long before others
learn of my awakening

641
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,652
and invade this quiet
little planet of yours?

642
00:42:56,685 --> 00:43:00,656
Sooner or later,
the gem will be mine.

643
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:06,195
Help me now, and I might
consider sparing your life.

644
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:08,430
I can't betray
my sister like that.

645
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:13,268
Do you think she would
grant you the same courtesy?

646
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,303
No.

647
00:43:14,336 --> 00:43:17,339
I see the way she treats you.

648
00:43:17,373 --> 00:43:20,576
These small torments
are just the beginning.

649
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:25,447
How long before
she puts her life before yours?

650
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:29,918
She would never do that.

651
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:32,921
I think.

652
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:36,358
You know this is the only way.

653
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:41,397
Give me the gem so we can
both be free of her madness.

654
00:43:42,598 --> 00:43:46,301
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can do it.

655
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,370
It will lead to bad things
if I help you.

656
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:50,506
Fine!

657
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:55,344
You are stronger than I thought.

658
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:58,714
But also incredibly stupid.

659
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:03,252
So... what happens now?

660
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:06,688
We wait for this dream
of yours to conclude.

661
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:13,629
Okay.

662
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:25,474
Alright, cats, what I'm about to
teach you today is confidential.

663
00:44:25,507 --> 00:44:30,245
The government can not,
under any circumstances,

664
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:32,281
find out about this game.

665
00:44:32,314 --> 00:44:34,316
Got it?

666
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:36,251
Okay, so there's two teams.

667
00:44:36,285 --> 00:44:38,287
Each team starts by throwing
their balls as far away...

668
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,422
So you got to run and get
the other teams balls in...

669
00:44:40,456 --> 00:44:42,691
Chuck them at your opponents,
the other player throws their

670
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:45,060
- ball as high as they can...
- And then spin around like this.

671
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:46,528
Each Jumping Jack
gives you a point.

672
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,297
Then whoever gets hit
has to take the ball.

673
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,265
But only while the opposing
player is doing...

674
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:53,368
But there is a special
move called the switcheroo.

675
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:56,472
Which happens when
two balls collide in mid air.

676
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:59,608
And when that happens, whoever
punches their opponent first

677
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:04,279
gets all of the other
team's points plus one.

678
00:45:04,313 --> 00:45:08,016
Okay, the game ends
when you reach 67 points.

679
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,256
I have no idea what's going on.
Do you?

680
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:24,233
Oh, no.

681
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:26,301
Get away from the kids!

682
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:27,503
Right now!

683
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:29,371
What the hell is that thing?

684
00:45:29,404 --> 00:45:33,642
- Just remember your training.
- There's no time. Shoot him!

685
00:45:39,348 --> 00:45:41,750
I should have let those hit you.

686
00:45:44,353 --> 00:45:47,389
Hurry up, PG.
We don't have all day.

687
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:54,229
You are protectors
of this realm?

688
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:57,633
I was expecting something
a bit more impressive.

689
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:59,836
Who are you?

690
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:02,271
Who am I?

691
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:05,474
Let me show you, law dealer.

692
00:46:18,855 --> 00:46:21,723
Ahh.

693
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:25,227
I am your master now.

694
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:32,601
Tell your people
darkness has fallen.

695
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:35,337
Resist the eclipse
of my power again

696
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,839
and I will not
show you the mercy

697
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:39,608
I've shown your friend.

698
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:42,277
Run.

699
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,683
Vince, give me the key!

700
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:07,436
Here, another contestant
for your game of nonsense.

701
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:13,475
PG, now I have to
start all over again.

702
00:47:13,508 --> 00:47:15,377
Okay, so there's two teams.

703
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:16,879
Each team starts by
throwing their ball

704
00:47:16,913 --> 00:47:20,549
as far away from
the other team as possible.

705
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:22,284
Do you get it?

706
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:26,688
See, he gets it.

707
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:29,892
Glad one of you
monster boys understands.

708
00:47:29,926 --> 00:47:31,693
That soulless husk
is just telling you

709
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,729
what you want to hear.

710
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:36,632
Whatever, you're dumb, I get it.

711
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:38,300
Let's play.

712
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,573
Oh, I get Alistair's
done for the day.

713
00:47:44,606 --> 00:47:46,441
Bye, Alistair.

714
00:47:46,475 --> 00:47:50,813
I'll be right back, you morons.
Don't move.

715
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:52,748
Are you okay, buddy?

716
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,717
Yeah, it's just...

717
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:57,452
What?

718
00:47:57,486 --> 00:48:01,490
Do you think
I'll ever be normal again?

719
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:05,327
Probably not.
But who cares?

720
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,663
I like you just
the way you are.

721
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:12,334
Oh, okay.

722
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:16,672
Bye, Alistair!
You beautiful blob.

723
00:48:19,675 --> 00:48:22,511
So the "F" word works
in a lot of different ways.

724
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:26,748
If you stub your toe, you can be
like, "Ow, my frigging toe!"

725
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:28,818
Or if you see something
weird or crazy,

726
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:30,820
you can be like,
"What the frig?"

727
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:33,755
But the best one is when
you're telling someone off.

728
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,726
You can be like...
you tell it to them, Luke.

729
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:40,328
Frig off.

730
00:48:40,362 --> 00:48:42,664
Frig off.

731
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:45,600
Use that on someone
you really hate.

732
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:57,412
What is this?
Some kind of special card?

733
00:48:57,446 --> 00:48:58,680
What is this junk?!

734
00:48:58,714 --> 00:49:00,649
I told you guys
to write me love letters

735
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:02,919
telling me how amazing I was!

736
00:49:02,952 --> 00:49:06,321
What a waste of beautiful card.

737
00:49:06,354 --> 00:49:08,623
What is love?

738
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:14,429
You know, have you ever felt all
warm and fuzzy about somebody?

739
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:16,465
Like when you rip out
your enemy's spine

740
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:18,633
and display it
to their grieving family?

741
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:22,404
No, not... no, not exactly.

742
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:23,840
Love is...

743
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:27,676
Love is a happy feeling
towards somebody you care about.

744
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:30,847
You feel complete.

745
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,547
Even if you didn't think
you were missing something

746
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:34,382
in the first place.

747
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:38,420
All I feel is anger and hate.
I will never be whole.

748
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:42,424
Don't worry about it, PG.
Love is for losers anyway.

749
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:46,495
Oh, yeah? I thought you were
so in love with Alistair.

750
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:47,864
That doesn't count.

751
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:50,298
We're just friends
that are going to get married

752
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:52,501
and be together forever.

753
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:53,903
And fight a lot,
like mom and dad do.

754
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:56,772
PG, I don't like the way Luke's
making fun of me.

755
00:49:56,806 --> 00:49:59,474
Kill him, please.

756
00:49:59,508 --> 00:50:01,510
No, please!

757
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:04,646
Stop!

758
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:06,816
Just kidding!

759
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,921
Your face.
You're such a scaredy cat.

760
00:50:11,954 --> 00:50:14,824
And you're just... no!

761
00:50:14,857 --> 00:50:17,592
So close.

762
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:18,795
That's it!

763
00:50:18,828 --> 00:50:21,763
Now you get to pull the wagon.

764
00:50:34,776 --> 00:50:36,813
Faster, you dog.

765
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:58,700
Hey, buddy.
You're safe now.

766
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:04,106
It was horrible.

767
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,774
His eyes.

768
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:08,845
It's like he was
looking into my soul.

769
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:10,847
And Vince.

770
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,397
Excuse me, human. I'm searching
for a nameless evil

771
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:31,533
that was buried here long ago.

772
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:34,669
He's awoken
and has most likely slaughtered

773
00:51:34,703 --> 00:51:37,505
half your people already.

774
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:39,175
Have you seen him?

775
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:43,779
No offense, ma'am, but that
description is a little vague.

776
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:47,415
I've seen him!
That think that killed Vince!

777
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,784
Emmett O'Brien,
didn't you listen to a thing

778
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,519
that this poor man says?

779
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:53,789
No.

780
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:57,459
God, you're a dumb ass.

781
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:01,864
I must find him.
Give me everything.

782
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,950
Something's coming.

783
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:23,551
What? You got to dump?

784
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:43,538
Welcome back to the land
of the living, master.

785
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:46,242
Spare me the theatrics,
Dark Scream.

786
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:47,676
What took you so long?

787
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:49,678
We came as soon
as we could, my lord.

788
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,546
Let me be the first to say

789
00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:55,684
that we are all so very glad
to see that you're alive.

790
00:52:55,717 --> 00:53:00,488
PG, are these silly
little guys your friends?

791
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:02,191
Why don't you introduce us?

792
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:03,926
They don't look very friendly.

793
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,832
Ah, yes, Paladins,
this is Mimi and...

794
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:13,970
her brother.

795
00:53:14,003 --> 00:53:16,272
It's Luke.

796
00:53:16,305 --> 00:53:19,141
You should know my name by now.

797
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:22,878
They are the humans
responsible for freeing me.

798
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:25,881
That's right. You're welcome.

799
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:28,951
Mimi has the Gem of Praxidice.

800
00:53:28,985 --> 00:53:32,687
Don't worry.
She doesn't know how to use it.

801
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:35,724
You may kill them now.

802
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:47,970
You fool.
Why would we do that?

803
00:53:48,004 --> 00:53:50,306
Excuse me?

804
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:53,275
We like things
the way they are now.

805
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,748
You must be joking?

806
00:53:59,782 --> 00:54:02,151
Far from it, master.

807
00:54:02,184 --> 00:54:04,286
We are quite content
with running the fifth moon

808
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,790
of Gigax ourselves,
sharing the duties equally.

809
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:09,892
We take turns
as the appointed leader

810
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:11,894
so everyone
gets a fair chance.

811
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:15,231
As you can see,
it is currently my turn.

812
00:54:15,264 --> 00:54:19,567
Let me guess, you made a deal
with those righteous idiots,

813
00:54:19,601 --> 00:54:20,903
the Templars.

814
00:54:20,936 --> 00:54:22,704
In exchange for
your imprisonment,

815
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:26,308
they agreed to spare us
any further inconveniences.

816
00:54:26,342 --> 00:54:29,812
I put my trust in the worst
the galaxy has to offer,

817
00:54:29,845 --> 00:54:32,815
and this is how you repay me?

818
00:54:32,848 --> 00:54:35,717
I should have known better.

819
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,788
Except for you, Cassius 3000.

820
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:40,688
I always knew
I couldn't trust you.

821
00:54:40,722 --> 00:54:45,194
Huh, come on.
We all knew this day was coming.

822
00:54:45,227 --> 00:54:49,231
So why don't you lay down
and die like a good little boy?

823
00:54:49,265 --> 00:54:52,234
Yeah, like a good
little boy, yeah.

824
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:54,303
You imbeciles.

825
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:57,639
Pandora's crusade
will not stop with me.

826
00:54:57,672 --> 00:55:01,377
Her gaze will fall upon your
wretched hides soon enough.

827
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:04,612
Your shared crown is nothing
but a symbol

828
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:07,383
of your own incompetence.

829
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:08,918
Then we will trade this crown

830
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:11,854
for one made
from your shattered skull.

831
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:13,355
Kill him!

832
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:15,391
PG, you jerk!

833
00:55:15,424 --> 00:55:17,860
Stop right there!

834
00:55:17,893 --> 00:55:21,263
What? No!

835
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:22,697
What are you doing?!

836
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,901
You told them to kill me!

837
00:55:25,935 --> 00:55:28,804
They're going to
kill you instead.

838
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:31,273
See how you like it.

839
00:55:55,297 --> 00:55:57,199
Ahh.

840
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:59,734
How long is this
going to go on for?

841
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:01,270
What do you mean?

842
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:05,341
I mean, shouldn't
he apologize or something?

843
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:08,377
No, it's all right. Hey, PG!

844
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,246
- What?!
- Apologize.

845
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:11,447
I'm sorry.

846
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,249
Not good enough.

847
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:15,184
Let's try this again,
but this time,

848
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:17,887
you got to really mean it.

849
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,389
A ruler never apologizes.

850
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:22,958
It's a betrayal
of everything I stand for.

851
00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:25,760
I would die... Aah!

852
00:56:25,794 --> 00:56:27,729
Yes, scream for me.

853
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:30,933
Fine, you don't want
to give me a real apology,

854
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:32,801
that's your problem.

855
00:56:32,835 --> 00:56:35,471
Come on, Luke. We go.

856
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:38,274
Wait!

857
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:39,842
Wait.

858
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:43,345
Yeah, do you have
something you'd like to say?

859
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,384
I am truly sorry,
little creature.

860
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:54,823
Great. Apology accepted.

861
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:57,159
Now, was that so hard?

862
00:56:57,193 --> 00:56:59,761
Go get them, dude.

863
00:57:22,051 --> 00:57:23,385
Yes!

864
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:26,388
Ha-ha!

865
00:57:44,473 --> 00:57:46,242
Oh, my...

866
00:58:14,303 --> 00:58:17,239
Taste of my magic, witch master.

867
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:26,882
No way, lady.

868
00:58:26,915 --> 00:58:29,184
You chose this, now live
with the consequences.

869
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:59,315
Please spare me.

870
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:12,294
Look into the pool
and see the horror that dwells

871
00:59:12,328 --> 00:59:14,596
inside true darkness.

872
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:20,336
Do you see?
That's where real darkness lies.

873
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:22,871
Within ourselves.

874
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:26,942
I... understand now.

875
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:29,211
Good.

876
00:59:42,991 --> 00:59:46,962
Maybe in the afterlife you can
be crowned the king of fools.

877
00:59:46,995 --> 00:59:48,397
Gloat all you want.

878
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,432
Soon enough the Templars
will find you.

879
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:53,569
And throw you back
in your dark prison forever.

880
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:57,606
Despite being a gibbering idiot,
you fought honorably.

881
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:01,977
So I will give you
a warriors death.

882
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,445
No, please.

883
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:29,338
The horrors you've just
witnessed cannot be unseen.

884
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:31,440
Your young minds
will carry this

885
01:00:31,473 --> 01:00:35,043
until it consumes you
in a miserable death.

886
01:00:35,077 --> 01:00:37,946
Cool.

887
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,948
Can we go home now?

888
01:00:39,982 --> 01:00:41,583
Yes.

889
01:00:41,617 --> 01:00:44,219
It's time to rest.

890
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:50,692
PG, what's wrong?

891
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:52,327
I'm dying.

892
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:53,629
- What?!
- What?!

893
01:00:53,662 --> 01:00:55,364
Of course.

894
01:00:55,397 --> 01:00:57,499
They must have saved my blood
from the battle

895
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:00,335
of the zone keepers
and cursed their blades with it.

896
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:04,006
Clever move, Dark Scream.

897
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:06,408
We can't move him
ourselves.

898
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:07,576
We need to call for help.

899
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:09,344
Great idea, dingus!

900
01:01:09,378 --> 01:01:11,246
How are we going to do that?!

901
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,715
Well, I don't know, cowboy cat,

902
01:01:13,749 --> 01:01:16,985
what is the difference between
a saddle and a can of paint?

903
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:21,323
- You're going to love this one.
- What is this? What is that?

904
01:01:21,356 --> 01:01:24,393
Oh, yeah. I bought a new TV.

905
01:01:24,426 --> 01:01:26,428
In other news, I'm going to take
a couple of weeks off work

906
01:01:26,462 --> 01:01:27,763
till my hand
can heal completely.

907
01:01:27,797 --> 01:01:29,731
So you might want to pick up
a few extra shifts

908
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:31,500
at the pharmacy.

909
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:34,236
You dumped me for this beauty.

910
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:37,072
- No!
- Hey. What the frig?

911
01:01:37,105 --> 01:01:39,341
Maybe you should pull up
your pants, huh?

912
01:01:39,374 --> 01:01:41,743
Just hike them up,
pack up your precious TV,

913
01:01:41,777 --> 01:01:43,645
get your lazy ass
out of this house.

914
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,215
Lazy?

915
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,417
How dare you!

916
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,352
You know how much
I hate that word.

917
01:01:50,385 --> 01:01:52,721
My parents used it,
my teachers used it.

918
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:54,590
And now you?

919
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:56,592
Shame on you, Susan.

920
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:59,261
You're better than that.

921
01:01:59,294 --> 01:02:01,363
You know what I hate, Greg?

922
01:02:01,396 --> 01:02:04,766
I hate how you will find
any excuse you can

923
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:07,369
not to go to work,
help with the kids,

924
01:02:07,402 --> 01:02:10,472
do anything whatsoever
around the house.

925
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:13,609
Oh, I don't do
a damn thing, huh?

926
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:16,345
Let's have it.
What do you do, huh?

927
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:25,254
I'm waiting.

928
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:27,256
Oh, you think you're frigging
better than me, huh?

929
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,291
You think you're frigging
better than me, huh?

930
01:02:29,324 --> 01:02:31,226
Well I have a BA in English.

931
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,561
What have you done
with your life?

932
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:35,697
Huh? What have you done
with your life?

933
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:37,766
I ask you.

934
01:03:00,522 --> 01:03:01,757
Find me!

935
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:04,560
Find me or you all die!

936
01:03:04,593 --> 01:03:07,563
Aaaah!

937
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:12,467
Aaaah!

938
01:03:16,638 --> 01:03:18,640
What the frig?!

939
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,512
Where am I going?

940
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:29,685
The ravine near highway 11
and Ryerson Avenue!

941
01:03:29,718 --> 01:03:31,353
Aaah!

942
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,257
Oh! Oh!

943
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:42,331
I don't know where that is.

944
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:43,732
Aaaah!

945
01:03:43,765 --> 01:03:45,367
Go south of Prescott Road

946
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,804
until you reach
the second set of lights!

947
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:50,439
Go!

948
01:03:50,472 --> 01:03:51,740
- Come on!
- Hurry!

949
01:03:51,773 --> 01:03:55,410
Over here! Go faster!

950
01:03:55,444 --> 01:03:56,745
Right here!

951
01:03:56,778 --> 01:03:58,815
No, no, no.

952
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:01,249
Aaah!

953
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:06,455
I'm sorry, PG.

954
01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:09,291
You should be.
This is all your doing.

955
01:04:09,324 --> 01:04:12,594
Could you move over and make
room for my wagon please?

956
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:22,304
Thanks, bud.

957
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:27,376
You think I'm lazy, PG?

958
01:05:11,788 --> 01:05:14,289
Who's mom talking to?

959
01:05:14,322 --> 01:05:17,459
Kids, kids get out of the truck
and come inside.

960
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:19,327
Why? Who's the skirt?

961
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:20,729
She needs to talk
to your friend, okay?

962
01:05:20,762 --> 01:05:22,832
It isn't safe out here.

963
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:24,733
Come, children.

964
01:05:24,766 --> 01:05:28,770
You don't want to be
anywhere near that... thing.

965
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:30,772
Pandora.

966
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:34,776
I see you've come to cleanse
the universe of me once again.

967
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:37,780
Immaculate timing as always.

968
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:40,682
Drop the disguise and show
these humans the face

969
01:05:40,716 --> 01:05:42,919
they will bow to once
you enslave them

970
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:45,520
into endless servitude.

971
01:05:45,554 --> 01:05:46,789
Endless servitude?

972
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:49,758
Sounds like being
married to you, Susan.

973
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,828
Greg, shut up
and get out of the truck.

974
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:53,628
Kids, come inside, okay?

975
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:55,764
Let these two figure
their shit out.

976
01:05:55,798 --> 01:05:58,467
Dad, don't.

977
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,469
Just do what she says, child.

978
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:01,570
I will not ask you again.

979
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:03,438
Uh, excuse me?

980
01:06:03,472 --> 01:06:06,742
You don't talk to me like that.

981
01:06:06,775 --> 01:06:09,377
Luke, here's my idea.

982
01:06:09,411 --> 01:06:12,481
You go beat her up,
and we'll drive away.

983
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,516
She doesn't look that tough.

984
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:17,552
Do not let her weak
human skin fool you.

985
01:06:17,586 --> 01:06:20,589
She will strike you
down immediately.

986
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:23,692
Good to know. Thanks, PG.
Luke, beat her up.

987
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:25,527
But PG just said...

988
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,764
Shut up, your wiener,
and go fight her like a hero!

989
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,900
Do it now!

990
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:35,604
You know what, Mimi?

991
01:06:35,637 --> 01:06:38,373
I can't. I just can't.

992
01:06:38,406 --> 01:06:40,642
You go beat up
that lady right now!

993
01:06:40,675 --> 01:06:43,311
I'll bash her brains
if you don't.

994
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:45,747
This has gone too far.
I've had enough.

995
01:06:45,782 --> 01:06:47,582
You can't push me
around anymore.

996
01:06:47,616 --> 01:06:50,752
Fine!
Then you're out of the band!

997
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:53,388
Greg, for once
in your lazy ass life,

998
01:06:53,421 --> 01:06:55,390
you don't actually have
to do anything, okay?

999
01:06:55,423 --> 01:06:58,627
Just get out of the truck
and come inside.

1000
01:07:13,475 --> 01:07:15,410
How's this for lazy, Susan?

1001
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:18,446
Greg.

1002
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,615
Hang on, kiddo.

1003
01:07:20,649 --> 01:07:24,653
Greg, don't even
thing about it!

1004
01:07:24,686 --> 01:07:28,090
Bye!

1005
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:36,098
We must act fast before
he's able to regenerate.

1006
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:38,433
This beast will consume
all the light in the universe

1007
01:07:38,466 --> 01:07:39,668
if we don't stop him.

1008
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:42,537
Okay. So what do we do?

1009
01:07:42,571 --> 01:07:44,706
Follow me.

1010
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:49,846
Slowly, slowly.

1011
01:07:50,947 --> 01:07:54,482
Gonna wrap you up, okay, PG?

1012
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:59,387
I feel my life slipping away.

1013
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:01,656
Stay with me, PG.

1014
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,425
I'm not going to let you go.

1015
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,796
There's only one remedy
for this curse.

1016
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:09,764
You must give me the gem.

1017
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:11,801
What?

1018
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:15,503
No, no, you'll kill everybody.

1019
01:08:15,537 --> 01:08:17,772
It's the only way.

1020
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,109
The gem is linked
to my life force.

1021
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:25,380
Once it's in my possession,
I will regain my strength.

1022
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:31,653
Excuse me.

1023
01:08:31,686 --> 01:08:33,722
Mr. Goreman.

1024
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:38,493
Can I get a moment alone
with my daughter, please?

1025
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:43,498
Thank you.

1026
01:08:55,811 --> 01:08:57,880
How you doing?

1027
01:08:57,914 --> 01:09:00,515
Dad, I'm sacred.

1028
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:02,751
I don't know what to do.

1029
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:05,754
First off, that's a lie.

1030
01:09:05,788 --> 01:09:07,455
I know for a fact
you've never been scared

1031
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:09,624
of anything in your life.

1032
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:12,795
That's true.

1033
01:09:12,828 --> 01:09:19,168
Look, I know I'm not
a good dad or a smart dad.

1034
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:21,703
But I still have
some dad wisdom for you.

1035
01:09:23,638 --> 01:09:27,843
When I was your age, a weird guy
in a van outside my school asked

1036
01:09:27,877 --> 01:09:30,679
if I wanted to see
his baseball cards.

1037
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:32,547
I said yes without thinking.

1038
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,683
And he took me
in the back of his van

1039
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:38,553
and showed me
his giant collection

1040
01:09:38,586 --> 01:09:42,258
of pristine baseball cards.

1041
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,559
I had a lot of fun.

1042
01:09:44,592 --> 01:09:47,830
And I'm thankful I put my trust
in that creepy weirdo.

1043
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:54,170
So I think you should trust your
weird murdering monster friend.

1044
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:56,571
It's the grown up thing to do.

1045
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:01,978
Thanks, Dad.
That makes a lot of sense.

1046
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:03,879
No problem, kiddo.

1047
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:06,215
I need a bit of a think.

1048
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:08,784
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

1049
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,260
Your partner made a very poor
choice taking the evil one

1050
01:10:18,294 --> 01:10:20,562
from us.

1051
01:10:32,674 --> 01:10:35,710
Oh, wow!

1052
01:10:35,744 --> 01:10:37,947
My mistake was
letting him live.

1053
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,616
It was selfish of me
to want him to suffer forever.

1054
01:10:41,649 --> 01:10:44,820
I won't make that mistake again.

1055
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:47,223
Drink it.

1056
01:10:47,256 --> 01:10:49,325
It's time for you
to stand beside me

1057
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:52,694
and right the wrongs
of this universe.

1058
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:54,596
I'll drink that.

1059
01:11:01,736 --> 01:11:03,571
Is it gross?

1060
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:13,215
The final battle has begun.

1061
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:16,919
The fate of the universe
rests in Pandora's hands.

1062
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,721
And what if she fails?

1063
01:11:19,754 --> 01:11:21,689
Then there will be
no stopping him.

1064
01:11:21,723 --> 01:11:23,926
She is our last hope.

1065
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:28,297
Stop hogging these blugels.
They're for everyone.

1066
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:35,271
Pass those blugels.

1067
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:54,390
Hi, God.

1068
01:11:54,423 --> 01:11:57,293
Now, I know I don't do
all the goody two-shoes stuff

1069
01:11:57,326 --> 01:12:01,897
you say everybody should do,
but I can't help it.

1070
01:12:01,931 --> 01:12:04,900
And I'll do whatever
the heck I want, okay?

1071
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:09,238
Anyways, I need your advice.

1072
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:13,775
A huge battle between evil and
worse evil is about to go down.

1073
01:12:13,809 --> 01:12:16,812
And I have a very
big decision to make.

1074
01:12:21,283 --> 01:12:23,419
What shades should I wear?

1075
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:25,387
That's a trick question.

1076
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:28,257
I know I'm going
to wear the zebra ones.

1077
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:32,795
In conclusion,
why am I even talking to you?

1078
01:12:32,828 --> 01:12:37,299
There's a new God in town,
and his name is Psycho Goreman.

1079
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,169
And he's coming for you, buddy.

1080
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:51,280
So this TV won't stop bleeding.

1081
01:12:51,313 --> 01:12:53,782
Okay, here's the deal, man.

1082
01:12:53,816 --> 01:12:56,852
I'll give you the gem
so you can kill that mean lady.

1083
01:12:56,886 --> 01:13:00,356
But you have to promise
that you won't kill us, okay?

1084
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:03,392
I will not kill you,
little creature.

1085
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,261
Or your family of idiots.

1086
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:07,830
Do you mean it?

1087
01:13:07,863 --> 01:13:09,832
Yes.

1088
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:13,735
Wait, what about telling him
not to kill everybody else

1089
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:15,471
on the planet?

1090
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:18,941
Oh, yeah. Oops.

1091
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:22,311
Oops is right.

1092
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:23,879
Oh, crud.

1093
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:27,349
What? Where's the gem?

1094
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:44,833
Your time is up, evil one.

1095
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:47,002
Oh, man! Get out of here, lady!

1096
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,872
Step aside, Mimi!

1097
01:13:51,507 --> 01:13:54,510
Mom?

1098
01:13:54,543 --> 01:13:56,412
Susan?

1099
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:03,519
- Hi.
- Shut up, thief.

1100
01:14:03,552 --> 01:14:05,854
Just walk away, child.

1101
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:09,959
It's time I rid the universe
of this cursed thing.

1102
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:11,527
Give me the gem, boy.

1103
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,363
No, not until my family is safe.

1104
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:15,931
That's the deal.

1105
01:14:15,965 --> 01:14:17,933
You don't get it.

1106
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:19,435
Do you, lady?

1107
01:14:19,468 --> 01:14:22,538
Nobody tells me what to do.

1108
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:26,774
Not you, not her, not him.

1109
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:28,377
Yeah.

1110
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:31,347
Not the president. Not anybody!

1111
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,415
Mimi, this is serious!

1112
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:34,984
Stop it right now!

1113
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,253
Never, ever, ever!

1114
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:39,221
That's some good
parenting, honey.

1115
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:41,357
I wish I could help.

1116
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:44,860
I'm just too damn lazy.

1117
01:14:44,893 --> 01:14:47,296
You!

1118
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:48,897
Whoa.

1119
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:50,966
Susan.

1120
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,434
Think about what
you're doing here.

1121
01:14:52,468 --> 01:14:53,469
Hey.

1122
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:54,903
Aaaah!

1123
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:56,472
Mimi, stop!

1124
01:14:56,505 --> 01:14:59,408
Shut up, you fat traitor!

1125
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:08,951
Killing me won't bring back
the thousands of warriors

1126
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:11,387
I've massacred
with my bare hands.

1127
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,524
No, but ending you will light
a new dawn for my people.

1128
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:19,461
And I shall lead the galaxy
toward a bright future,

1129
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:23,465
built on a law
and order of the Templars.

1130
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:29,204
Go, Pandora! I believe in you.
I've always believed in you.

1131
01:15:31,974 --> 01:15:36,045
Just couldn't stay away
from the TV, could you, Greg?

1132
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,914
Susan, I would still
forgive you for this

1133
01:15:38,947 --> 01:15:41,383
if you stopped right now.

1134
01:15:42,584 --> 01:15:44,420
I'll go to therapy now
if you want,

1135
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:47,589
if you still want to do that.
if that's what you still want.

1136
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:57,633
Come on, yes!

1137
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:58,967
Die!

1138
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:00,903
Please. Don't.

1139
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:04,006
I've been doing
a lot of thinking, Greg.

1140
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:13,515
I think you're the cause
of all the headaches in my life.

1141
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:18,520
And I think it's payback time!

1142
01:16:18,554 --> 01:16:22,024
Susan, you're choking me.

1143
01:16:22,057 --> 01:16:25,494
Give me the gem.
Don't make me use this, bro.

1144
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:28,197
It's just like Dad said.

1145
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:32,267
People are the real monsters.

1146
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,937
And you're one of them.

1147
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:44,446
Is it not part
of the Templar code

1148
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,651
to allow a defeated foe one last
chance for battle, if requested?

1149
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:52,988
The Templar code
says lots of things.

1150
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:56,959
You are weak,
and we have the gem.

1151
01:16:56,992 --> 01:17:00,062
There is no way
you could defeat me in battle.

1152
01:17:00,095 --> 01:17:03,665
I do not request
hand-to-hand combat.

1153
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:07,336
If you are truly the warrior
you claim to be,

1154
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:10,339
you will honor this request.

1155
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:20,416
Name your contest.

1156
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:24,420
I will defeat you
no matter the circumstance.

1157
01:17:31,393 --> 01:17:33,562
Mimi!

1158
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:35,931
Huh?

1159
01:17:38,634 --> 01:17:41,003
You will decide the contest.

1160
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:48,610
Okay, you three
will be Team Suck.

1161
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:51,346
You two plus me
will be Team Hero.

1162
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,349
If Team Hero wins,
we get the gem.

1163
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:58,687
And if Team Suck wins,
you can have PG.

1164
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,355
Got it?

1165
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:03,225
Could you explain
the switcheroo part again?

1166
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:05,994
Nope.
Should have paid attention.

1167
01:18:06,028 --> 01:18:08,597
Okay, chumps, let's do this.

1168
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,937
Ready...

1169
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:18,440
Set...

1170
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:21,477
Still love you, Susan.

1171
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:24,513
- Crazy Ball!
- Crazy Ball!

1172
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:39,495
Ow!

1173
01:18:46,468 --> 01:18:49,671
I don't understand sports.

1174
01:18:49,705 --> 01:18:51,607
No.

1175
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:57,346
Quick!

1176
01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:58,680
Do Jumping Jacks!

1177
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:00,616
Crazy Ball. Crazy Ball.

1178
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:01,750
What are Jumping Jacks again?

1179
01:19:01,784 --> 01:19:03,820
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1180
01:19:03,853 --> 01:19:06,655
Where are your gods
tonight now, Pandora?

1181
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:11,760
Aah!

1182
01:19:14,663 --> 01:19:16,632
Yeah!

1183
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:25,340
I win butt bonus.

1184
01:19:28,377 --> 01:19:30,312
66 points.

1185
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:32,581
One more point
and Team Suck wins.

1186
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,349
Dream on, back stabber.

1187
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:37,787
This is for the time you made me
eat my own sand castle.

1188
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,621
I was helping you!

1189
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:44,293
Now that beautiful sand castle
will be with you forever!

1190
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:48,430
I was so sick I had to miss
a week of school.

1191
01:19:48,463 --> 01:19:50,699
You're welcome!

1192
01:19:56,705 --> 01:19:59,441
The switcheroo.

1193
01:20:00,877 --> 01:20:03,712
If they get
the switcheroo, they'll win!

1194
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:07,249
Oh, this game is
complete nonsense.

1195
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:14,289
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1196
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:18,393
Dumb dumb chuck, here we go!

1197
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:29,271
Yes!

1198
01:20:29,304 --> 01:20:31,406
I win again.

1199
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,241
We win!

1200
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:38,347
Aaah!

1201
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,516
How does failure taste, Pandora?

1202
01:20:43,485 --> 01:20:45,454
Now give me the gem.

1203
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:47,756
I will humor this no longer.

1204
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,595
No way!

1205
01:20:56,431 --> 01:20:57,800
What are you doing?!

1206
01:20:57,834 --> 01:20:59,768
The beast must die!

1207
01:20:59,802 --> 01:21:01,536
Mimi, get out!

1208
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,805
No!

1209
01:21:02,839 --> 01:21:04,773
I'll protect you, PG.

1210
01:21:04,807 --> 01:21:07,376
Aaah!

1211
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:09,846
Luke, give me the gem!

1212
01:21:09,879 --> 01:21:13,482
Please throw it to me, you dork!

1213
01:21:17,686 --> 01:21:20,489
I don't know.

1214
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:24,493
You're always so mean to me,
and I just wish that you would

1215
01:21:24,526 --> 01:21:27,663
say you were sorry for once.

1216
01:21:28,865 --> 01:21:30,766
And I'm always there
for you when you need me,

1217
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,402
but I thought we were a team.

1218
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:36,271

01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,365
Hey.

1242
01:23:10,398 --> 01:23:14,402
Yeah, you need to take me
to the hospital, okay?

1243
01:23:14,436 --> 01:23:18,473
I can't feel my hand.
I think it might be broken.

1244
01:23:18,507 --> 01:23:19,909
Luke, can you drive?

1245
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:25,514
- No.
- The judgment is...

1246
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:27,682
death.

1247
01:23:31,419 --> 01:23:34,824
You're toast now,
you big metal moron.

1248
01:23:45,433 --> 01:23:47,435
Even with your powers restored,

1249
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:50,605
how can you expect
to defeat my holy blade?

1250
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,708
You are defenseless
against me.

1251
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,545
Then I'll make my own.

1252
01:24:38,988 --> 01:24:42,859
You'll not stand between me
and my holy destiny.

1253
01:24:44,827 --> 01:24:46,829
Frig off.

1254
01:25:06,715 --> 01:25:08,818
I'm not going to say it.

1255
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:10,786
But I have something
to tell you.

1256
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:51,493
Not my hunky boys!

1257
01:25:51,526 --> 01:25:53,930
Aaaah!

1258
01:26:03,738 --> 01:26:06,242
You have no idea
what you've done.

1259
01:26:06,275 --> 01:26:09,145
The universe
as you know it is finished.

1260
01:26:10,578 --> 01:26:13,215
Thank you.

1261
01:26:13,249 --> 01:26:14,683
I'm proud of you guys.

1262
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:17,552
Finish me, nameless one.

1263
01:26:17,585 --> 01:26:20,555
Get this over with
so that I can be at peace.

1264
01:26:20,588 --> 01:26:22,925
There will never
be peace for you.

1265
01:26:22,959 --> 01:26:24,794
I've been to the after world,

1266
01:26:24,827 --> 01:26:29,597
and it's a place where fools
like you suffer the worst.

1267
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:32,168
And my name is...

1268
01:26:32,201 --> 01:26:34,870
Psycho Goreman.

1269
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:39,842
That's a beautiful name.

1270
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,676
You fought with honor.

1271
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:44,713
It's only fitting I give you
a warriors death.

1272
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:46,949
No, not that!

1273
01:26:46,983 --> 01:26:49,185
No!

1274
01:26:49,218 --> 01:26:50,853
- Let's go.
- Oh, no.

1275
01:26:50,886 --> 01:26:52,221
What is he doing?

1276
01:26:52,254 --> 01:26:54,123
Oh, you don't want to see this.

1277
01:27:03,299 --> 01:27:07,535
You know, I remember when this
used to be a shoe factory.

1278
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,283
Delicious.

1279
01:27:21,317 --> 01:27:23,551
Well, what now?

1280
01:27:23,585 --> 01:27:26,322
Now I will do
what I was meant to do...

1281
01:27:26,355 --> 01:27:28,157
destroy everything.

1282
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:31,293
The age of chaos begins anew.

1283
01:27:31,327 --> 01:27:35,898
Yes, and?

1284
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:39,135
And I will spare your lives.

1285
01:27:46,909 --> 01:27:49,577
Take it.

1286
01:27:49,611 --> 01:27:50,913
Really?

1287
01:27:50,946 --> 01:27:54,817
I don't need it
anymore, little one.

1288
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:58,686
For the first time
in centuries I feel whole.

1289
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,589
Thanks to your family,
I now know that true power

1290
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:04,193
comes from within.

1291
01:28:04,226 --> 01:28:06,862
The power of love.

1292
01:28:06,896 --> 01:28:08,630
What?

1293
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:10,299
Goodbye, Mimi.

1294
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:14,837
Goodbye, Greg and Susan and...

1295
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:17,373
boy.

1296
01:28:17,406 --> 01:28:20,675
It's time for me to take
this new found power

1297
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:24,146
and use it to destroy
the galaxy.

1298
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:30,886
PG, wait!

1299
01:29:07,957 --> 01:29:12,394
Well, we learned a lot today.

1300
01:29:12,428 --> 01:29:14,762
About what?

1301
01:29:16,298 --> 01:29:19,201
Okay, okay, let's go
to the hospital.

1302
01:29:19,235 --> 01:29:24,206
Okay, Greg, come on.
Come. This way.

1303
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,175
Whoa, okay.

1304
01:29:45,027 --> 01:29:47,863
Chaos has erupted in downtown
Spangler Springs

1305
01:29:47,897 --> 01:29:50,266
as police are powerless
to stop the rampage

1306
01:29:50,299 --> 01:29:53,903
of what can only be described
as a giant naked purple man.

1307
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:56,906
