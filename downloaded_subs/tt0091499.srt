1
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,956
Honey, come on over here, sugar buns!

2
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:06,132
This machine just called me an asshole!

3
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:12,435
I knock.

4
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,820
Jesus Christ, do you know
how to play this game?

5
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:19,329
Sure!

6
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:22,320
Well, then, why don't
you make your last draw?

7
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:18,842
The bridge is going up!

8
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:21,963
- It can't be! That light was green!
- Stop!

9
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:28,636
What the fuck!

10
00:04:46,717 --> 00:04:48,611
Look out!

11
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:33,946
Far out!

12
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:44,827
It's gonna bump!

13
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:16,396
The light's green.
The cross bar never went down.

14
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,495
You goddamn stupid asshole!

15
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,567
Can't you see we've
got a situation here?

16
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,528
So, you get Mickey mantle
over to the baseball game?

17
00:06:57,628 --> 00:07:00,067
You go on and joke all you want.

18
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:04,731
He hit three balls over the fence.
Once of 'em must've gone 250 feet.

19
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:14,199
Holy God, look at that thing!

20
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:15,909
I'll get it.

21
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,101
Handy, you son-of-a-bitch!
I thought you was down in Texas.

22
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,392
No, that was last week.

23
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,594
You like that?

24
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:40,025
- That's some rig, alright.
- Give her a big drink.

25
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,776
- I gotta have some coffee.
- Right.

26
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,377
- Hey, men.
- Handy.

27
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,953
This damn thing!

28
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:04,834
What's the matter?

29
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:07,843
Well, this thing was workin'
just fine a few minutes ago...

30
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:10,631
and now I can't get pea-turkey on it.

31
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:15,635
Do you wanna bring me a coffee when
you get done jerkin' on that thing?

32
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:20,931
Robinson.

33
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,517
Robinson, get in here, boy.

34
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,026
I got eggs on!

35
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:30,113
I don't give a lady bug!
I want you in here now!

36
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:33,898
Wanda, shut that radio off
and mind them eggs for Billy!

37
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:49,993
Your mama!

38
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,701
Steve Gayton, Mr. Hendershot,
Duncan Keller's had an accident.

39
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,993
<i>Shit! What happened to him?</i>

40
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:10,871
He got diesel in his eyes.
I'll be damned if I know how.

41
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:14,499
Is that all? Flush his eyes.
Leave me alone.

42
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:19,246
I got me some talkin' to do in here.
I gotta wipe everybody's ass around here.

43
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:24,256
Shitty job, but I reckon somebody's
gotta do it. Ain't that right, Bubba?

44
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:27,553
No. Lemme, lemme get this straight now.

45
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:31,338
You want me to work for nine hours...

46
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:33,765
and only clock in for eight?

47
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,259
I know you've been to college, boy.

48
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,803
Screw that... not this kid.

49
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,723
You know what that
star means, don't you?

50
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,945
You ain't that obtuse, are you?
Parole, boy!

51
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:51,111
Your ass belongs to me or it belongs
to the state of North Carolina.

52
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:55,701
You've got one hell of a
racket goin' here, ain't you?

53
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:01,414
Put that back in the rack for me
on your way by, would you?

54
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:06,705
Thank you, Bubba.

55
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,586
Shit!

56
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:18,475
Wanda, honey, you want me to
get that cup of coffee myself?

57
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,090
Bill!

58
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:26,182
It's getting' outta hand in here!

59
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,850
You ain't talkin' about me,
are you honey?

60
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:35,480
Jesus Christ!

61
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:44,662
Those eggs comin' pony express or what?

62
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:47,325
Just a minute, Sir!

63
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,764
- It's biting me! Make it stop!
- What is?

64
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:05,184
That knife! That knife!

65
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:07,723
Quick, quick a rag!
Somebody give me a rag!

66
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:11,437
That knife go rabid on you, sweet thing?

67
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,360
It turned it motor on and it bit me.

68
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,398
- Short circuit, maybe.
- There it goes again!

69
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:25,781
It's on again!

70
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:29,288
It's still goin'!

71
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:32,279
Look at that sucker! Nail it!

72
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:18,036
Now what?

73
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:06,078
Safe!

74
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,836
Come on, sodas! I'm buyin'!

75
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:21,344
You guys can help me
pick stuff up, y'know?

76
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:30,010
No sodas!

77
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:44,989
What the hell?

78
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:02,464
Shit!

79
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:13,683
Coach, are you okay?

80
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,184
Come on, coach!

81
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:13,403
You'd better give up, sugar pie.

82
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:17,194
I haven't been able to get something
since half an hour or so.

83
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,073
I must have a broken antenna
or something.

84
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:22,960
<i>By the moment the information...</i>

85
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,952
How far you goin' up
the road, sugar pie?

86
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,459
It depends on how long you can
keep your hands to yourself.

87
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:34,342
What's that, sweet thing?
I didn't quite catch it.

88
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:40,340
- I said, I don't really know.
- Just driftin', huh?

89
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:46,930
I know what it's like. I've been
driftin' myself now for about 10 years.

90
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:49,693
When I started in this business,
about eight years ago...

91
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:52,321
- Right after I got outta the army...
- I got somethin'.

92
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:53,739
I bet you did.

93
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,115
<i>...our microwave facilities broke down.</i>

94
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:59,233
<i>Reports of strange occurrences
are pouringing over wire services.</i>

95
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:02,039
<i>We'll have further
bulletins as they come in.</i>

96
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,083
<i>But for the moment,
let me repeat this urgent message.</i>

97
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,500
<i>If you are near a major highway...</i>

98
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,286
<i>get away at once! Get away at...</i>

99
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:16,921
- Shit!
- What's wrong there, sweet thing?

100
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,180
Go in there.

101
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,640
If you don't get your hand off my leg
you're gonna be wipin' your ass...

102
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,385
with a hook the next time
you take a dump.

103
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,978
I swear I never heard no
talk like that when I was a boy.

104
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,269
What the hell are you doing, girl?
What's the matter with you?

105
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:46,363
Lordy, Lordy, girl!
You goin' crazy or somethin'?

106
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,661
Did you hear anything that man said?

107
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,828
Are you... are you on something?

108
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:59,257
- Oh, Jesus!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

109
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:02,924
Don't you go walkin'
away from me like that!

110
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,928
You come back here, girl!

111
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,555
- Come back here and listen to me!
- Sweeten my shorts!

112
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:11,643
I swear, sometimes I think this old
world forgot what good manners is!

113
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:14,229
Here I go, give you a ride
in my brand new car...

114
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:17,515
and look at the garbage
comin' outta your mouth!

115
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,818
Do you know what I think?
I think it's a damn!

116
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:24,530
Look at what that stuff does to people!

117
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,158
The whole civilization is
about to make them fall.

118
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:30,901
You think the newspapers are any better?

119
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:36,707
You know it ain't newspapers that are
gonna save this world or even TV!

120
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:40,576
I'm tellin' you right here and
now as far as I said, all that's...

121
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:43,873
- ...from the son, Jesus!
- It ain't full yet!

122
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,975
Shepherd, I shall not want!

123
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:05,147
- Jesus, what the hell happened here?
- I don't know.

124
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,331
What in the dickens is
goin' on around here?

125
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,125
That's a damn good question, isn't it?

126
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:24,752
- That was your rig, wasn't it, Handy?
- Yeah.

127
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:27,837
- Well then, who was drivin' it?
- I don't know.

128
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:30,625
But he must've been a hot-wire champion.

129
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:33,000
Hell's bells!

130
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:54,986
We gotta get some gas.

131
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:58,072
Well, that's good 'cause
I gotta go to the ladies.

132
00:19:58,172 --> 00:19:59,490
Can I come in and watch?

133
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,118
No, you cannot come in and watch.

134
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:04,160
Ouch! Shoot!

135
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,340
- Did you see?
- What, honey?

136
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:24,504
Never mind.

137
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:44,187
Oh, Jesus!

138
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:54,911
Curt!

139
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,783
Curtis!

140
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,874
Is he dead?

141
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:40,833
Great God!

142
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:06,605
I need some ethyl.

143
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:20,572
Curt, I don't like this!

144
00:22:31,188 --> 00:22:32,750
Curtis!

145
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,055
Are you dead?

146
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,053
Shit!

147
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,110
My God.

148
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:43,276
Get in right now!

149
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:48,573
Go! Go! Go!

150
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:02,544
The other way! The other way!

151
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:06,551
Come on, honey!

152
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:10,215
You stop that yelling! You know I
can't drive when you shout at me!

153
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:35,189
Boy, ain't this a no
count piece of shit!

154
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:40,487
You do what I said with that body?

155
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,207
Got him downstairs, sure.

156
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:46,169
Pretty crispy, Mr. Hendershot.
What happened?

157
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,294
Fucked if I know, Bubba.

158
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:52,250
Fucked if I know.

159
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,527
So, anybody in there?

160
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,615
No, not now.

161
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,407
You're cute.

162
00:26:58,723 --> 00:27:01,495
Yeah? Am I?

163
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,081
Not that cute.

164
00:27:04,395 --> 00:27:06,586
Well, maybe I'll grow on you.

165
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:12,877
Look at that. There's nothing!

166
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:17,595
Did you ever see that much nothing
at ten fifteen in the morning, hero?

167
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:27,266
Name's Bill.

168
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:30,640
Hi, Bill. Brett.

169
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,644
<i>Although microwave relays...</i>

170
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:08,938
<i>was knocked out since
nine o'clock this morning...</i>

171
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,026
<i>this frightening mechanical revolt
appears to be occurring everywhere.</i>

172
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:16,029
<i>Europe, London, New Delhi, Moscow...</i>

173
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:19,905
<i>The reports we have are the same.</i>

174
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:22,950
<i>Machines apparently
operating themselves...</i>

175
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,486
<i>are under the direction of an
agency we don't understand...</i>

176
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:29,070
<i>are going on a homicidal rampage.</i>

177
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:58,900
<i>Some cities are waking
more slowly than others.</i>

178
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,277
<i>Only one thing is completely
certain this morning.</i>

179
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:03,821
<i>And that is...
no machine is to be trusted.</i>

180
00:29:03,921 --> 00:29:05,865
<i>Unplug all the electrical appliances.</i>

181
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:08,737
<i>If you have a truck or car...</i>

182
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,979
Let me tell you right now, boy and girl.

183
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,440
That this beautiful
American truth way Bible...

184
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,900
with fine git edge an full page
color pictures can be yours for...

185
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,733
9,95. Wait a minute before you say
anything, let me tell you something.

186
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,031
This Bible has everything in it.

187
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:27,445
From the creation of this beautiful
world of ours to the fall of mankind.

188
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,497
Look, Duncan, just,
hang on a little longer, alright?

189
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,041
I gotta find my boy. Christ!
What's goin' on out there?

190
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,697
Look, man. You can't even see!

191
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:37,419
I can see just fine.

192
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,003
I don't wanna pop you one, Joe.
You keep yapping' at me, I'm goin'!

193
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:45,343
Duncan? Duncan!

194
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:46,553
What's he doin'?

195
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:49,092
- You really goin' after Deke, man?
- Yeah.

196
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:51,266
Look, how many fingers do you see?

197
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:53,141
Eight, twelve?

198
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:56,847
Alright, so I got a little double vision.
But it's clearin' up, Bill.

199
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,438
I gotta find my boy.

200
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,764
I gotta!

201
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,725
Anything could be goin' on there.

202
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,516
Christ sakes!

203
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,021
You leave without punchin' out...

204
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:14,120
and you ain't never gonna
have to punch in again, Bubba.

205
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,899
Good!

206
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:18,874
You leave me along, fat fuck!

207
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:20,917
No, leave him alone!

208
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:24,201
Or what?

209
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:27,585
Or I'll knock your teeth in, Bubba.

210
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,182
Duncan, look out!

211
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:53,477
Oh God!

212
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:01,579
It'll give you protection
in time of danger.

213
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,540
It'll give you health in time of
sickness and fondness leviticus.

214
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,956
It just...

215
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:13,712
Oh, sucker!

216
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:19,051
Son-of-a-bitch! Out my way, bitch!

217
00:33:19,654 --> 00:33:21,715
Fucker!

218
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:24,841
I'm gonna tear 'em up, boy!

219
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:36,601
Where the hell are you goin',
drunk son-of-a-bitch?

220
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:39,106
Get back inside, you idiot!

221
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,867
God dammit, you snot bag!
Come on out!

222
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:43,910
- Come on! Get outta here!
- Let me go!

223
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,830
You wanna rock and roll with me?

224
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,706
Bastard!

225
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:53,294
Right here, you, prick!

226
00:33:53,394 --> 00:33:57,161
You overgrown! Scum ball! ¡By God!

227
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:06,253
Get outta the way, you crappy asshole!

228
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,687
This is Bubba Hendershot at Dixie Boy.
Anybody read me out there?

229
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:04,692
Come on in, Rusty!

230
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,904
No one. No one in the cab
of that motherfucker at all.

231
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:11,072
- Horse puck!
- What we gonna do now?

232
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:17,538
- I don't know.
- This is Bubba Hendershot...

233
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:21,571
at the Dixie Boy! God dammit,
Rusty, come on in, boy!

234
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:23,915
Spread it on the ground next to him.

235
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:26,378
Hurry up, man!

236
00:35:26,478 --> 00:35:28,752
Jesus, he's starting to draw flies.

237
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:37,639
What the hell are you doing in there?

238
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,088
Changing.

239
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:42,018
That salesman had his hands
all over me and he's dead now.

240
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:45,436
I don't like the smell of him on me.
I don't like it.

241
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:48,970
Jesus!

242
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:56,905
For chrissake, don't just stay there.
He's dripping all over my floor.

243
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:59,897
- Get him outta here!
- Come on, man. Come on.

244
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,988
What the hell are you guys looking at?

245
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:10,919
- Nothing.
- That's right. Nothing.

246
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:13,329
Well then, go look at it somewhere else.

247
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:20,290
Okay.

248
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,749
Goddamn things got no right to
be running through this depot.

249
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,918
Where are they going, Curtis?

250
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:35,588
I don't know.

251
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:40,086
Greensboro, maybe. Maybe Charlotte.

252
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:43,878
Why?

253
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,971
Don't know.

254
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,980
Try the radio again.

255
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,542
I think I've just loaded my pants.

256
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,911
Curt.

257
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:21,417
Curtis, it's coming after us!

258
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:43,315
My God, Curtis. It's gonna bump us!

259
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:56,703
Mom, please talk to me!

260
00:40:21,457 --> 00:40:22,852
Hang on!

261
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:38,028
Curtis, I knew I never
should let you drive again.

262
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:46,825
Curtis, make him stop following us!

263
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,982
- Curtis, what is going on?
- I don't know!

264
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,575
But I know, we call the police
from the truck stop up there.

265
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,108
My God!

266
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,659
When we get to that truck stop
everything will be all right. Oh, yes.

267
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:11,614
What are you doing?

268
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:14,696
Do you see that gap?

269
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:18,589
The next time it comes around
I'm gonna shoot right through it.

270
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:22,299
No, you don't!
They'll gang up and squash us!

271
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:23,801
I can do it!

272
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:27,004
All so we can be inside where they are?

273
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:29,796
What do you think is gonna
happen to us if we stay out here?

274
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,095
I'm scared.

275
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,970
Me, too.

276
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:44,349
Billy! Come here
and look at these fools.

277
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:49,566
- Now what?
- They're dead.

278
00:42:50,174 --> 00:42:52,118
- Yeah, maybe not.
- Don't go out there, man.

279
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:54,657
- Don't, Joe!
- Eat this.

280
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:57,235
Hang on tight!

281
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:23,938
Curtis, I'm upside down. I'm stuck.

282
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:26,900
Where are you going?
Will you get me out of here?

283
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,807
I'm caught in this goddamn seatbelt.

284
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,479
I told you not to use the seat belts.
I told you a thousand time.

285
00:43:34,216 --> 00:43:36,784
I said, watch out!
Curtis, will you help me?

286
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:40,788
Watch that thing, will you?
That thing looks sharp!

287
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:44,582
He's not my Curtis.
Where is my Curtis? Shit!

288
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:48,502
Goddamn, asshole!
Curtis, will you help me?

289
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:50,165
Help me!

290
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,757
Alright, Bubba!
Stick this one up your own cheek!

291
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:08,354
Fuckin' truck's gotta be dee-po'ed.
That one's deep po'ed for sure.

292
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:11,555
Reload me, Joey.
Come on, reload me, boy.

293
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,742
And I want that shit, Bubba!

294
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:24,448
Come on! Run!

295
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:32,085
Honey, you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

296
00:44:32,185 --> 00:44:33,127
Where'd you get all that stuff?

297
00:44:33,227 --> 00:44:35,667
- We got a bunch of that stuff down.
- Shut up, Joey.

298
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:40,503
Found it in my
Christmas stocking, Bubba.

299
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:45,207
Get inside. Come on, let's get inside.

300
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,602
How are the love birds?

301
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:48,026
Heart rates are
slowin' down a bit, I think.

302
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:49,936
That's good.

303
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:52,103
Mother's helper?

304
00:45:55,011 --> 00:45:58,328
A girl hitchin' her way down
to Florida needs some protection.

305
00:45:59,307 --> 00:46:03,075
- That's what you're doing?
- Yeah.

306
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:09,296
I was doing it before the machines
went into maximum overdrive.

307
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:19,968
I'm scared.

308
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,649
If I put my arm around you...

309
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,731
would you stick me with that thing?

310
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:40,815
You don't stick a person
with a strap razor.

311
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:42,733
It's more like...

312
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,029
And I wouldn't...

313
00:46:58,611 --> 00:47:00,123
Okay?

314
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,594
Holy cow!

315
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:57,010
- Joey?
- Yeah?

316
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:00,310
Get up here.

317
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:03,891
It's over, man.

318
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:08,102
Does he really got a lotta
fire power down in the cellar?

319
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:11,822
You heard him tell me
to shut up, didn't you?

320
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:14,411
Come on, Joey, this is serious.

321
00:48:16,306 --> 00:48:17,701
He's got a lot.

322
00:48:18,767 --> 00:48:20,198
Grenades?

323
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:21,789
Well.

324
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:25,206
What else?
Flame throwers, rifles, what?

325
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:29,915
You're gonna get us in an
awful lot of trouble, man.

326
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:35,587
In case you didn't realize it, boy,
we're already in trouble.

327
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,388
Talk to me, Joey.

328
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,471
Everything. He's got everything.

329
00:48:46,084 --> 00:48:47,977
Now, go and leave me alone, Billy!

330
00:48:51,088 --> 00:48:52,731
Holy shit!

331
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,438
You think he stole all this?

332
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,368
No, I think he bought it,
cheap like a guy like him does.

333
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,735
Buys things cheap?

334
00:49:02,848 --> 00:49:06,249
Buy cheap and sell dear.
It's the American way.

335
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:13,919
Jesus Christ!
This is cute, isn't it?

336
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,424
You find any money on him, Bubba?

337
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:25,093
I don't now what to make of this, boy.
You're bright, I know you are.

338
00:49:26,202 --> 00:49:28,354
You keep on bein' obtuse.

339
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:31,309
We don't wanna steal anything.
We just wanna get outta here alive.

340
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:34,978
You messin' again, Bubba,
who ain't oughta be messin'.

341
00:49:36,503 --> 00:49:38,948
Sometimes even college boys
don't learn their lesson...

342
00:49:39,048 --> 00:49:41,571
until they had their chops
busted a few times, do they?

343
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:44,781
You know what's goin' on
outside or are you blind?

344
00:49:45,304 --> 00:49:49,071
You tell the little road twit
about your illustrious career?

345
00:49:49,473 --> 00:49:53,669
He's a blood-thirsty criminal, alright.
Regular John Dillinger.

346
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:55,367
Goddamn you!

347
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:59,257
Couple o' charlotte cops caught him
in this little bitty grocery store.

348
00:49:59,357 --> 00:50:03,838
With a sack o' money in his hand,
thumb up his ass, big grin on his face.

349
00:50:03,945 --> 00:50:06,348
You wanna get outta here, boy.
One call, I get you outta here!

350
00:50:06,448 --> 00:50:09,765
Oh yeah? Who you gonna call?
The North Carolina state police?

351
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,771
Now listen. I won't play any goddamn
games with you, Hendershot.

352
00:50:12,871 --> 00:50:14,730
I just wanna get the hell outta here.

353
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:19,103
- I'm warnin' you, boy.
- No, man, I'm warnin' you!

354
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:29,232
This thin's over,
your ass is grass, boy.

355
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:32,407
Do you hear me?

356
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:35,828
Joey!

357
00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:41,464
Goddamn you, Joey!
I told you to keep an eye on the keys!

358
00:50:41,564 --> 00:50:43,292
I owed a guy some money.

359
00:50:45,691 --> 00:50:48,000
I was about twenty at the time.

360
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,847
Not real bright about most things.

361
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:54,257
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

362
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:00,103
What gets to me is his stupidity.

363
00:51:04,877 --> 00:51:08,443
Cops put that spotlight on me
and I just froze like a rabbit.

364
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,648
It's all right.

365
00:52:17,692 --> 00:52:20,380
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What's that?

366
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,596
You sure make love like a hero.

367
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:49,448
Look at that light.

368
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,029
Do you know what I think?

369
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,747
- What?
- I think it's the comet.

370
00:52:56,645 --> 00:52:59,215
We've been in its tail
for almost twelve hours.

371
00:52:59,315 --> 00:53:02,134
And if it is that comet that's making
everything go crazy...

372
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:05,004
then all we gotta do is
stay alive for the next seven days.

373
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:08,713
No problem.

374
00:53:25,296 --> 00:53:26,776
I got an idea.

375
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:40,948
Can you sail?

376
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:44,171
A little. Hobie cats
and things like that.

377
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:46,664
Good deal. I used to crew big ones.

378
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,830
Sailboats, no motors.

379
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,845
No motors?

380
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:55,558
Where would we go?

381
00:53:55,658 --> 00:53:58,269
I'm thinkin' about this
place called Haven.

382
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:01,768
It's an island about
six miles off the coast.

383
00:54:02,036 --> 00:54:06,730
And there aren't any motor vehicles
allowed on the place. None whatsoever.

384
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,515
None?

385
00:54:10,128 --> 00:54:11,808
You know...

386
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:15,982
you are not only a hero...

387
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:18,867
you are a genius.

388
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,643
The whole goddamn world's goin' to hell.

389
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:57,946
They can't! We made them!

390
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:01,115
Look, honey. You've gonna hurt yourself.
Come on, sweet thing.

391
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,703
- Don't you 'sweet thing' me!
- Now, Wanda June, baby, just let...

392
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:08,821
They can't! We made them!

393
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:18,049
You can't! We made you! Do you hear?

394
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:23,924
Where's your sense of loyalty?
You things!

395
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:30,933
We made you! We made you!

396
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:36,106
Made you! We made you!

397
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:38,108
- Wanda!
- We made them!

398
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:40,186
- Wanda!
- We made them!

399
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:57,366
Not the dark. Please God, don't...

400
00:56:00,812 --> 00:56:05,755
I'm scared.
Please don't let us be in the dark!

401
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:18,049
Man, stop with them damn spoons.

402
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:20,438
Safer than the juke box.

403
00:56:20,538 --> 00:56:22,348
I like spoons.

404
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:27,861
Man, this is one piece of shit.

405
00:56:27,961 --> 00:56:29,939
Shit!

406
00:56:31,048 --> 00:56:33,951
Damn trucks ain't never
gonna let us outta here.

407
00:56:34,051 --> 00:56:35,614
I believe it.

408
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,417
- Place your bets.
- I don't usually play for peanuts.

409
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:53,588
Come on.

410
00:56:55,403 --> 00:56:58,376
- I gotta eat.
- Deal, woman.

411
00:57:01,577 --> 00:57:03,090
Hit me.

412
00:57:06,873 --> 00:57:08,388
There's lot less of them.

413
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,891
Yeah.

414
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:15,357
Looks like they're running dry.

415
00:57:15,922 --> 00:57:17,780
Think they're pushin' them in back.

416
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:22,743
Maybe tomorrow it'll be our world again.

417
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:25,451
I don't know.

418
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:28,447
Was it ever?

419
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:31,452
I hate those fuckin' trucks.

420
00:57:31,729 --> 00:57:34,454
I never did like trucks anyway.

421
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:37,251
Holy shit!

422
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:39,548
What was that?

423
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:44,348
God, that's that Bibles'
salesman I rode in with.

424
00:57:44,448 --> 00:57:46,223
There's some guy out there?

425
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:51,217
Sweet Jesus, help me!

426
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:57,730
Help me!

427
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:06,203
- Let's go get him!
- No, you don't!

428
00:58:06,303 --> 00:58:09,414
You let some of those other big
strong men go out and get him.

429
00:58:09,514 --> 00:58:12,072
I didn't sign on here to be no hero.

430
00:58:12,891 --> 00:58:14,072
Yeah!

431
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:17,076
Wait a second! Wait a second! Wait up!

432
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:21,582
Just like the old joke,
you can't get there from here.

433
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:24,380
We gonna stand around
and listen to him do that?

434
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,093
Y'know, I think there
might be a way to get to him.

435
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:27,943
Now, the shower drain runs into
the ditch where the guy is.

436
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:29,487
Will we fit?

437
00:59:29,587 --> 00:59:31,906
- One way to find out.
- You boys are crazy.

438
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:36,484
Curt? Curtis! Curtis!

439
00:59:38,802 --> 00:59:40,151
What are you doin'?

440
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,998
- I'll be right back.
- You ain't goin'!

441
00:59:43,098 --> 00:59:44,708
There's a man layin'
hurt out there, honey.

442
00:59:44,808 --> 00:59:48,003
There's gonna be a man hurt layin' here
if you don't quit this foolishness.

443
00:59:48,103 --> 00:59:50,130
If it was your man out there,
you'd want someone to go, wouldn't you?

444
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:52,883
Well, it ain't. You're not goin'.

445
00:59:52,983 --> 00:59:54,332
I'm goin'!

446
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:58,256
Don't make me a widow
on my wedding day, Curtis.

447
00:59:58,446 --> 00:59:59,842
Okay.

448
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:04,845
Just scoot right across.

449
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:07,641
- Pick up your feet and try not to...
- I can handle it.

450
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:12,815
You boys are just as crazy as a couple
of rats in a plugged-up shithouse!

451
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:17,819
You are without a doubt one of the
biggest fuck heads I ever met.

452
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:20,033
- Wish me luck.
- Yeah.

453
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:22,323
You ready? Let's do it.

454
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:57,558
Good thing that one was outta gas.

455
01:00:57,668 --> 01:00:59,348
What makes you so sure that it was?

456
01:01:01,378 --> 01:01:03,984
I don't think we need to
worry about that right now.

457
01:01:35,243 --> 01:01:37,017
Okay.

458
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:47,024
Oh man, are you ready? One, two, three.

459
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,904
Bombs away!

460
01:02:06,271 --> 01:02:09,458
- Think it'll hold?
- Fucked if I know.

461
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:32,820
- You okay?
- Yeah.

462
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,025
- Okay. You wanna grab that bag?
- Thanks.

463
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:41,445
Oh, Jesus. This sucker weighs a...

464
01:02:42,847 --> 01:02:44,906
Oh, boy!

465
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:52,621
Great smell, huh?

466
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:55,916
- You okay?
- Yeah.

467
01:03:02,197 --> 01:03:04,505
I wonder how many
people have peed in this.

468
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:12,773
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

469
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,972
How's it taste?

470
01:03:28,053 --> 01:03:30,778
- Shit! I'm sending' you a friend.
- Shit!

471
01:03:32,057 --> 01:03:34,082
Get outta here!

472
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:19,286
Mister?

473
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:54,113
- Help me!
- How?

474
01:04:54,382 --> 01:04:59,037
- Pull me! Pull me!
- I can't! You're too heavy!

475
01:04:59,137 --> 01:05:01,162
Get me out of this ditch...

476
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:05,448
or by Jesus I'll kill you!

477
01:05:12,314 --> 01:05:16,051
Shit! What a great time! I wish I could
do that every day. What a blast!

478
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:18,425
¡Bill! Bill!

479
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:22,295
- Bill, help me!
- Jesus! That's Deke!

480
01:05:23,826 --> 01:05:25,269
Help me!

481
01:05:25,369 --> 01:05:27,595
- Come on!
- Please, help me!

482
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:34,361
Stop pulling me.

483
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:36,613
- He's dead!
- No he isn't!

484
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:38,115
¡He's dead!

485
01:05:38,215 --> 01:05:40,406
He's dead! He's dead!

486
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:44,568
Let's go. Come on, dammit!

487
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:49,416
Bill, you okay, bud?

488
01:05:49,516 --> 01:05:52,157
Yeah, I'm okay.
Will you your ass, for chrissake?

489
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:01,547
Okay.

490
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:09,056
- Let's go.
- Bill?

491
01:06:13,454 --> 01:06:17,519
Bill, is my dad okay?

492
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:22,440
Come on.

493
01:06:26,341 --> 01:06:27,691
Let's go partner.

494
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:34,082
I think that truck got 'em.
That's what I think.

495
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,166
I think they're dead.

496
01:06:37,684 --> 01:06:39,199
No, they're all right.

497
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:43,590
- Then, where are they?
- There they are! They just came up!

498
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:47,007
That ain't no salesman.
That's Duncan's kid.

499
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,179
Go, go!

500
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:07,142
- Way to go, Billy!
- Hello, boy.

501
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:13,075
You ain't gonna be satisfied until you
get 'em right in here with us.

502
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:14,738
Cigar, Joey.

503
01:07:17,346 --> 01:07:19,123
Mr. Hendershot, did you
see he nailed that big one?

504
01:07:19,223 --> 01:07:21,208
- Bill, are you okay?
- Yeah.

505
01:07:21,308 --> 01:07:23,251
How'd you find the kid?

506
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:27,412
Bill, where's my dad?

507
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:32,713
Duncan got scrubbed by
on of them big boys out there.

508
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:37,004
- Touch break, kid.
- You unbelievable shithead!

509
01:07:44,496 --> 01:07:45,927
Is it true?

510
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:50,306
Is it true?

511
01:07:53,296 --> 01:07:54,692
Yeah, it's true.

512
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,276
No!

513
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:07,863
No, no. Hang on, now.

514
01:08:08,893 --> 01:08:11,451
- Hang on, Deke.
- Mr. Hendershot.

515
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,260
Just a little lesson
from the road twitch.

516
01:08:20,654 --> 01:08:22,253
Hold on, Deke.

517
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:27,985
Bill?

518
01:09:28,256 --> 01:09:29,652
Bill!

519
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:32,869
Bill, wake up!
There's something out there.

520
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:36,240
There's something out there.
You gotta see this.

521
01:09:36,765 --> 01:09:38,540
Come on! Wake up!

522
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:59,631
It's right up here.

523
01:10:16,427 --> 01:10:19,614
What the fuck is goin' on here?

524
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:28,996
Now what?

525
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,339
Holy God!

526
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,833
Alright!

527
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,832
Alright, God dammit!

528
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:42,690
You want a war?

529
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:44,406
You got one.

530
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:46,992
- Man, I wouldn't do that.
- Shut up, Bubba.

531
01:11:47,092 --> 01:11:49,567
Shit! Get down!

532
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,453
How do you like that, chickenshit?

533
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:31,107
Jesus Christ!

534
01:12:39,016 --> 01:12:41,204
It stopped, man.

535
01:13:01,869 --> 01:13:04,060
You sons-of-bitches!

536
01:13:30,563 --> 01:13:33,423
- Wanda, no!
- You sons-of-bitches!

537
01:13:33,523 --> 01:13:38,343
- Don't go.
- We made you!

538
01:13:38,443 --> 01:13:42,931
Don't you understand?
You can't do this!

539
01:13:43,031 --> 01:13:45,139
We made you!

540
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,533
¡Wanda, Wanda!
That's Wanda June out there, dammit!

541
01:14:02,633 --> 01:14:04,196
Deke!

542
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:06,702
Deke, goddammit, you're gonna
get killed. Stay down.

543
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:10,072
It's right there.
If it wants to waste us, it will.

544
01:14:28,782 --> 01:14:30,676
Now what is it doing?

545
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,639
It's morse.

546
01:14:33,744 --> 01:14:35,270
Bullshit!

547
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:39,435
No, really. I should know.
I got a merit badge in it this spring.

548
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:41,852
Well, what's it sayin', kid?

549
01:14:45,129 --> 01:14:47,237
Give me a pen.
I can't keep up with it.

550
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:09,426
Incredible, they want us to feed them.

551
01:15:09,526 --> 01:15:10,803
Feed 'em?

552
01:15:10,903 --> 01:15:14,055
Fuck 'em. Let 'em starve!
Half of them's outta gas already.

553
01:15:14,323 --> 01:15:16,301
Let 'em starve, it won't take long.

554
01:15:22,081 --> 01:15:25,814
We can't fill 'em anyway.
We ain't got no power.

555
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:29,892
Shit!

556
01:15:33,589 --> 01:15:36,481
I'll be damned.
I'm gonna turn on the pumps.

557
01:15:36,968 --> 01:15:40,073
Hope none of them left home without
their American Express cards.

558
01:15:42,974 --> 01:15:45,166
Bill, wait!

559
01:15:49,564 --> 01:15:50,960
Wait!

560
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:55,546
It's not a good idea. It's like Neville
Chamberlain giving in to the Nazis.

561
01:15:56,443 --> 01:15:58,124
Come here.

562
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:00,425
Okay.

563
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,558
- Now, you see that one, right?
- Yes I do.

564
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,435
Okay. Now look,
here's the way I figure it.

565
01:16:04,535 --> 01:16:06,353
The big guys,
they're heavy weights, okay?

566
01:16:06,453 --> 01:16:09,524
They crash in here, they won't break
the floor and open the cellar.

567
01:16:09,624 --> 01:16:11,734
But that one, that bastard ain't
no reason why he couldn't...

568
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:15,235
call in a truck full of napalm
and hose this place down.

569
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:18,697
Just take care of yourself, okay?

570
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,614
What are they gonna do?
Run me down?

571
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:24,817
Shit, that'd be like a junkie tryin' to
run down his connection.

572
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,601
Alright, you bastard!

573
01:17:44,586 --> 01:17:46,978
Tell all your friends
the main line's open.

574
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,067
Got the best shit on the
east coast, practically uncut.

575
01:17:55,177 --> 01:17:56,988
You got that, fuck face?

576
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:28,147
This could be a very long day.

577
01:18:55,692 --> 01:18:57,206
Served, guy.

578
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:40,838
Shut up, already!
You ain't don' so bad here! Here!

579
01:19:41,858 --> 01:19:43,836
There! Suck on that!

580
01:19:49,032 --> 01:19:51,009
I'll take over.

581
01:19:53,828 --> 01:19:55,307
Thanks.

582
01:19:57,831 --> 01:19:59,892
I hope they choke on it.

583
01:21:10,522 --> 01:21:12,120
Sorry, guys.

584
01:21:13,525 --> 01:21:16,298
It was fun while it lasted,
but we're all out.

585
01:21:38,798 --> 01:21:40,194
What?

586
01:21:40,383 --> 01:21:41,779
What do you want?

587
01:21:53,854 --> 01:21:55,047
What?

588
01:21:55,147 --> 01:21:57,754
- What's it doin'?
- I don't know.

589
01:23:06,879 --> 01:23:09,948
Billy, come on, I'll take over here.

590
01:23:10,173 --> 01:23:11,569
He's all done.

591
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,742
They don't understand.

592
01:23:14,845 --> 01:23:16,241
What's that, Billy?

593
01:23:16,596 --> 01:23:20,829
How it is to get tired.
How a man gets tired.

594
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:25,378
Why should they? Come on.

595
01:23:25,478 --> 01:23:30,836
- If you need any help, call me.
- I will. Come on, man.

596
01:23:34,195 --> 01:23:36,303
We've been puttin' stuff
down in the cellar.

597
01:23:36,823 --> 01:23:38,641
Now the kid said there's a
big sewer pipe down there.

598
01:23:38,741 --> 01:23:41,019
He couldn't get in
because of the wire and shit.

599
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,013
But we can use it to get outta here.

600
01:23:48,918 --> 01:23:50,598
Looks like the coffee break's over.

601
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:53,111
His master's voice.

602
01:23:53,879 --> 01:23:57,980
- Go on in and lay down now.
- All right.

603
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,873
It isn't the comet, you know?

604
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,172
- It's the broom.
- What?

605
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,248
Brooms.

606
01:24:21,446 --> 01:24:25,345
Imagine you're a race of aliens, right?

607
01:24:26,535 --> 01:24:30,138
And you're looking for
a new place to live.

608
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:37,612
You're lookin' for a planet like
we look for a new place to live.

609
01:24:37,712 --> 01:24:39,606
A new house or something...

610
01:24:41,007 --> 01:24:42,735
So here's Earth.

611
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:46,903
Only it's like this big old house...

612
01:24:48,929 --> 01:24:51,487
and it's polluted...

613
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:56,085
dirty and smoky.

614
01:24:57,104 --> 01:25:01,086
Grease on the walls,
soot in the chimney...

615
01:25:03,777 --> 01:25:09,255
And they send their
interstellar cleaners...

616
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,094
sending their broom.

617
01:25:17,164 --> 01:25:19,188
Sweep us all up.

618
01:25:21,585 --> 01:25:23,562
That's what it is, a broom.

619
01:25:24,171 --> 01:25:27,856
They use the machines
to sweep us right up.

620
01:25:44,024 --> 01:25:45,963
Mister!

621
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:47,586
Mister!

622
01:25:51,028 --> 01:25:52,626
Come over here.

623
01:26:02,206 --> 01:26:03,886
How are you doing?

624
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,180
Tired and scared.

625
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:08,605
I've got this plan.

626
01:26:12,466 --> 01:26:14,145
Come on with this thing already.

627
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:16,403
Bitch!

628
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:22,582
We never gonna get out here.
Really.

629
01:26:22,682 --> 01:26:24,281
Cool, champ!

630
01:26:25,143 --> 01:26:28,959
Little human business to take care of,
some you wouldn't understand.

631
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:35,174
When I said run, you run, okay?

632
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:38,181
- What you gonna do?
- Don't worry, just run, okay?

633
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:39,676
What you gonna do?

634
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,639
Run!

635
01:26:56,047 --> 01:26:59,233
I ain't never seen a hero
with his ass in the air like that.

636
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:06,035
Hi, baby.

637
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,469
I bet there's spiders down there.

638
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,807
I hate anything with
more than four legs.

639
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:25,932
I can't do this!

640
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:29,386
I'm just gonna keep...
Oh, don't drop me now!

641
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:32,102
I just gotta see Curtis if you drop me.

642
01:27:43,381 --> 01:27:46,075
- What, Curtis?
- Just stay down.

643
01:27:46,175 --> 01:27:48,567
I wish we could get outta here!

644
01:27:57,561 --> 01:27:59,420
Holy shit!

645
01:28:01,941 --> 01:28:04,831
Stay down, Bubba. Holy shit!

646
01:29:07,249 --> 01:29:09,772
Jesus is coming and he is pissed.

647
01:29:27,935 --> 01:29:31,121
- Can we get outta here?
- Yeah, it's time to get outta here.

648
01:29:31,437 --> 01:29:33,118
Let's go, gang! Let's go.

649
01:29:34,315 --> 01:29:35,830
Let's go.

650
01:30:08,472 --> 01:30:09,986
¡My God!

651
01:30:10,683 --> 01:30:13,289
That son-of-a-bitch is goin' up again.

652
01:30:22,777 --> 01:30:24,761
- God almighty!
- Move it!

653
01:30:24,861 --> 01:30:26,346
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go!

654
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:28,921
Come on, go, go!

655
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:26,354
- How far, Bill?
- To the Marina?

656
01:31:27,668 --> 01:31:29,529
About a half a mile.

657
01:31:29,629 --> 01:31:35,284
<i>Humans here, humans here,
humans here, humans here...</i>

658
01:31:35,384 --> 01:31:40,248
<i>humans here, humans here,
humans here, humans here...</i>

659
01:31:40,348 --> 01:31:46,620
- <i>Humans here, humans here.
- For my dad, shit head son-of-a bitch!</i>

660
01:31:55,235 --> 01:31:56,833
I don't want this anymore.

661
01:32:08,707 --> 01:32:11,016
- I got him!
- Curt!

662
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:13,189
Curtis!

663
01:32:33,271 --> 01:32:36,874
Hurry up, you guys!
Come on, get in the boat!

664
01:32:42,863 --> 01:32:45,338
Right there is the one
I was thinkin' about.

665
01:32:45,948 --> 01:32:48,554
We better hurry up.
It's getting light.

666
01:33:17,018 --> 01:33:19,826
Bill, where's Brad?

667
01:33:45,294 --> 01:33:47,486
Adios, motherfucker!

668
01:34:14,237 --> 01:34:16,926
What happens with it? Mother's helper!

669
01:34:19,909 --> 01:34:22,516
Come here!
Somebody help me with these things!

670
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:41,404
You think we're gonna be all right?

671
01:34:43,221 --> 01:34:46,409
Deke, I know everything's
gonna be all right.

672
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:17,021
Curtis, when can we get off this boat?
You know I get seasick.

673
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,605
I think I'm gonna whoops my cookies!
