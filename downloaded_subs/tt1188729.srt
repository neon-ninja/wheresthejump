Recording:
You're all that's left of us.

00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:30,160
Good luck.
God bless.

00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:32,791

Bower.

( gasping )

34
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,245
- Who are you?
- l'm Bower.

35
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,724
Corporal Bower, sir.

36
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,319
Bower?
Bower?

37
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:37,852
You're waking
from extended hypersleep.

38
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,695
- Bower?
- This is disorientation.

39
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,792
Could you get that
fucking light out of my eyes?

40
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,133
Sorry, sir.

41
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,597
( groans )
Where are we?

42
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,631
Aboard the Elysium.

43
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:53,645
The Elysium?

44
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,581
Where are we?

45
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,880
l don't know.

46
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,250
Where's the rest of the crew?

47
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,548
ls it our shift?

48
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,355
- Our rotation?
- l believe so.

49
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,520
Aren't they supposed
to be here to wake us up?

50
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:11,393
l don't know.

51
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,966
Hit the lights, will you?

52
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,366
There's a problem
with the power, sir.

53
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:25,377
( groaning )

54
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,003
Who woke you up?

55
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,344
lt had to have been
the flight computer.

56
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,976
There's no one here
except us.

57
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,509
lt's cold.

58
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:37,580
l've been awake for over an hour
and l still can't remember anything.

59
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,194
The last time l crawled out
of a hyperbunk

60
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:44,890
it took me quite a while
to get it all back.

61
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:47,399
What was your--

62
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,367
what was your last flight, sir?

63
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,370
l don't know.

64
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,372
Sir, do you even know
where we're going?

65
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,273
l remember the training,

66
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:59,642
but not the destination,
the mission.

67
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,874
l figured you'd tell me.

68
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,405
Payton:
lf this really is our ship,

69
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,542
then this room should
be locked into position

70
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:08,679
and behind that door
should be the bridge.

71
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,882
Jesus.

72
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,983
Somebody was trying to get out.

73
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,232
- Lieutenant.
- ( blows )

74
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,701
None of the activators are working.

75
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,033
Yeah, it figures.

76
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:28,599
Without unified threading
we can't connect.

77
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,404
Hold on here.

78
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,843
We can at least
get this station to work.

79
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,880
( humming )

80
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,621
( laughs )

81
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,123
l didn't even think of that.

82
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,422
( chuckles )

83
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,894
All right. Jesus.

84
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:55,959
Lieutenant Payton on the com.
Anybody copy?

85
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:01,270
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team--

86
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,103
Shit.

87
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:07,169
- 5.
- How do you know that?

88
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:14,646
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

89
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,917
Anybody copy?

90
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,891
Anyone respond.

91
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,428
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

92
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:25,556
Anybody awake up there?

93
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:28,192
Team 4 is supposed
to be here for flight rotation.

94
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:29,929
Where could they be?

95
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,469
Maybe they couldn't get to us.

96
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,843
Where did he go?

97
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:47,112
( rumbling )

98
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:51,317
Power systems must be free floating
between uncoupled circuits,

99
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:54,019
or something the override grid
won't even lock in.

100
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,550
What do you think?

101
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:56,823
( rumbling stops )

102
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:59,331
( clanking )

103
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,026
Somebody's up there.

104
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:06,367
Uh, it's ventilation.

105
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:08,897
The system keeps rebooting
after each surge.

106
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:10,238
That could be anything.

107
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:14,212
Listen, l think we should
get out of here.

108
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:17,410
l'd rather be up and out
than stuck in the trunk, wouldn't you?

109
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:18,518
Test test.

110
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:19,712
Test test.

111
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,152
Payton: Copy.

112
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,885
Lift me up.

113
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,763
Our 2nd lieutenant must
have come through here.

114
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,997
lt's the only way.

115
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,739
lt's fucking dark in here.

116
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,743
Payton: Don't worry.
Just take the first way out.

117
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:47,974
l'll guide you back here to open
the doors from the outside.

118
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,916
How are we doing?

119
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:55,750
See anything?

120
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:57,415
Nothing yet.

121
00:12:57,457 --> 00:13:00,392
Not a single vent opening
or anything.

122
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,156
What about on your end?

123
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,629
( rumbling )

124
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:08,031
Power surges keep happening
in longer increments just like you said.

125
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,467
Reactor timing is offset in the core.

126
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:14,337
lt's trying to reconnect.

127
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,273
But it won't until it's reset.

128
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,402
Payton:
How do you know that?

129
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:23,407
l don't know.
l can't even remember my-- Jesus Christ!

130
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:29,651
But l know everything there is
to know about that damn reactor.

131
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:32,487
Payton:
That's the training talking.

132
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,117
You must be our technical engineer.

133
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,788
( rumbling )

134
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,426
Found an intersection.

135
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:45,903
Copy that.
Anything look promising?

136
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,634
A whole lot of the same--
nothing.

137
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,513
- Taking a left. Make a note.
- Payton: Left it is.

138
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,665
( clanging )

139
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,273
Payton.

140
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,849
Payton!
Payton, do you copy?

141
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,614
l don't know if l'm going in circles.

142
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:39,121
And, um, l can't breathe.

143
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,389
Payton, do you copy?

144
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:44,328
Payton:
l'm here. l'm here.

145
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:48,890
Easy now, easy. Breathe.
Just listen to me.

146
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:51,460
- l just want to stand up.
- Calm down.

147
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:54,200
- l can't breathe.
- Stop it and listen to me.

148
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,367
- Now let's just get you back here.
- Back?

149
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,845
Are you fucking kidding me?
l can't even turn around.

150
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,370
Do you know
how far l've gone, Payton?

151
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:05,179
- Listen to me.
- l just want out of this fucking thing!

152
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:08,415
Payton:
Put your mind somewhere else.

153
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:11,150
Like where?

154
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,283
This may not be
the best time to tell you,

155
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:14,987
but l got the door open.

156
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:19,628
You fucking kidding me?

157
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,600
Yeah, l'm kidding you.

158
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:25,934
( laughs )

159
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,566
You see?
Now that's not so bad.

160
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,600
We're gonna get you through this.
We're gonna figure this out together.

161
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,669
- You hear me?
- Uh-huh.

162
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,476
You spent eight years
in the hyperbunk.

163
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,778
A couple of more minutes
in a shaft won't kill you.

164
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:39,011
Eight years?

165
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:42,179
l do remember two years
being our duty rotation.

166
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,816
lf we're team 5, that means
we've been out for eight years.

167
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,383
l don't think
you're here by default.

168
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:51,453
You were a select pick.
We all were.

169
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,965
This was something special.

170
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,232
Someone's been through here.

171
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,636
- Wait a second.
- What's wrong?

172
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,578
l'm at an angle.
Oh shit, l'm at an angle.

173
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:07,909
l'm at an angle!

174
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:11,443
( groans )

175
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:14,453
Bower, what happened?

176
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,286
What is it?

177
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:24,262
Bower, are you hurt?

178
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,822
( groaning )

179
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:34,831
Bower, what happened?

180
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,403
l can hear you breathing.
Are you all right?

181
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,497
( groaning )

182
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:16,037
- Can you hear me?
- ( breathing heavily )

183
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:23,288
( groans )

184
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,883
Bower, are you all right?

185
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,258
l've-- l've found Cooper.

186
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:34,266
He's dead.
l'm in a boot locker.

187
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,665
( rumbling )

188
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:38,101
( groans )

189
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:40,367
Bower?

190
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:43,401
You all right?

191
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,377
Make that an overhead compartment.

192
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,942
Payton, l got out.

193
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:59,516
- ( static )
- Payton?

194
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,492
Bower, do you hear me?

195
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,462
Do you read?

196
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:05,396
( creaking )

197
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,370
( panting )

198
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,700
Payton, are you there?

199
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:21,042
Payton, can you hear me?

200
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,626
Payton, do you copy?

201
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:45,727
( lights crackling )

202
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,103
Payton?

203
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,574
Corporal, can you hear me?

204
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,845
Corporal, can you hear me?

205
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:58,740
( clanging )

206
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:18,503
( grunting )

207
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,300
Hey.

208
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,864
Hey, l need to talk to you!

209
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:25,001
Wait! Stop!

210
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,510
Don't run again, okay?

211
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:36,544
l don't care if you were
stealing or anything.

212
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:41,490
l just want to ask you
a couple questions.

213
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,762
How are you awake?

214
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:53,627
Hello?

215
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,133
Hello!

216
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,736
What, are you fucking deaf?

217
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,278
Hello?

218
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,687
Jesus!

219
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:41,647
- ( speaking German )
- What?

220
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,150
Don't move.

221
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,194
Wait. Wait a second.
l'm with the flight crew.

222
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,460
Don't you move.

223
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,800
Really, l'm part of the flight crew.

224
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,465
- Take them off.
- What?

225
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,773
Shoes.

226
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:08,211
l'll gut your ass.

227
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,015
- ( gasps )
- ( roaring )

228
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:34,602
( growling )

229
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,575
( roaring )

230
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,718
( crunching )

231
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:02,591
( roaring )

232
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:13,167
( panting )

233
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:36,832
What the?

234
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,394
( growling )

235
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,569
( roaring )

236
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,717
( roaring )

237
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,628
( sniffing )

238
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:14,696
( growls )

239
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,541
Payton:
Bower, do you read?

240
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:47,368
- ( roaring )
- ( gasps )

241
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,644
God damn it, answer me.

242
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,082
( growling )

243
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:10,991
Payton:
Bower, do you hear me?

244
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:14,390
Do you read?

245
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,493
( Bower whispering )
You are not hearing me.

246
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:20,596
There's no procedure for this.
They can't write a book for this.

247
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,107
After what l just saw, procedure
just went out the fucking window.

248
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:25,110
Payton:
Listen, l need you to calm down.

249
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:27,704
You're all we've got out there
if we're gonna figure this out.

250
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,976
Let's get back to these--
these other guys.

251
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:33,246
Guys?
Those weren't guys.

252
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,753
They were hunting.

253
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:39,155
They-- they took Cooper's body.

254
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:41,921
Just like a fucking pack of--

255
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:46,191
They didn't seem human.

256
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:49,689
We have to try
and contact the bridge.

257
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:53,193
You're assuming that there
is someone on the bridge.

258
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:55,536
There has to be.

259
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:57,166
We can't be alone in this.

260
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,268
Well, alone or not,

261
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,802
we can't assume help will be coming.

262
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:07,441
Out here there is no rescue
and there is no turning around.

263
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:10,683
l don't think this thing
was even built to return.

264
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:12,155
What are you talking about?

265
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:15,160
l'm saying that this
is no ordinary transport.

266
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:17,594
We're not out on the belt
collecting data.

267
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,223
We're not hauling cargo.

268
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:23,325
We are the cargo.

269
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:27,998
60,000 people
on a single launch trajectory.

270
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,474
Tanis.

271
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:33,137
Man on TV:
25 billion people watched in awe.

272
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:36,045
These breathtaking images
of Tanis arrived

273
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,811
from the Popolous probe and were
broadcast yesterday.

274
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:41,251
These were taken as the probe
was entering the orbit

275
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:43,914
of the only Earth like planet
known to exist.

276
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:47,448
People of the whole world are watching
as the probe sent into space

277
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:52,020
is transferring data exceeding
even the most optimistic expectations.

278
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:54,498
We knew to expect water on Tanis.

279
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:56,797
We knew to expect
reasonable temperatures.

280
00:25:56,835 --> 00:25:58,564
But the questioned remained--

281
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:02,267
will this planet meet the extremely
complex and unlikely combination

282
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:05,674
of parameters to support life
as we know it?

283
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:08,475
The probe has touched down
on the planet six days ago.

284
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,572
lt's sending off its first transmission

285
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:13,585
that is expected
to arrive any second now.

286
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,678
( man speaking over radio )

287
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:27,627
Ladies and gentlemen,

288
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:31,124
this is an unprecedented
moment for all mankind.

289
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,637
Are we seeing this?

290
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:35,867
First detection as we had hoped.

291
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:38,138
This needs to be verified,
but it appears

292
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:40,940
some form of plant life is present.

293
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:44,642
My God, life on Tanis.
There is life detection.

294
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:46,776
We have habitat detection.

295
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:49,878
Verified, this is a monumental
day for all of us.

296
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:53,016
Only a matter of time before
we send people out there.

297
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:55,219
Processing and population.

298
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,057
We're a settlers vessel.

299
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,188
Elysium was a one-way ticket.

300
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,134
How could l have...

301
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:04,567
left her?

302
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:08,068
How could l have done that?

303
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,400
l loved her.

304
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:18,216
Payton:
We've got to get to the bridge.

305
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,845
We've got to get control of the ship
before these guys rip it apart.

306
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:23,411
This is too fucking important.

307
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,151
- Payton, where is your wife?
- What?

308
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,716
Do you remember the recruitment?
The breeding tests,

309
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,421
the husbands, the wives?

310
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:34,228
We didn't leave them behind.
They're here somewhere onboard.

311
00:27:57,356 --> 00:28:00,223
l've got to find her before
these fucking animals do.

312
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:02,488
Try to think.
Where would they be?

313
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,654
A sleeping compartment
for non-service personnel?

314
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:06,493
Wait, hold on.
Think for a second.

315
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,499
l remember there were thousands
of passengers that weren't part

316
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,058
- of the development team. Families.
- You listen to me.

317
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:14,470
You know how big this ship is?
And you have no idea where your wife--

318
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:17,532
where our wives might be.

319
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,067
lf you go off on some
wild goose chase

320
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:24,208
we're gonna be no closer to getting
ourselves out of this situation

321
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:27,184
and with even less time
to regain control of the ship.

322
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:31,383
Once we've taken control of the systems,
finding them will be easy.

323
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:33,323
Are you hearing me?

324
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:37,687
We save the ship,
we save them.

325
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:48,433
- Security locker.
- What?

326
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:55,279
Non-lethal antiriot guns.

327
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:57,975
Payton:
Close up they'll do some damage.

328
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:20,767
( humming )

329
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:30,010
All right, l'm gonna lay out
a path for you

330
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:32,778
and try to bypass
the main security grids.

331
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:36,345
Without main power
we'll never get these doors open.

332
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:39,414
Listen, if you can get me
to the reactor bay

333
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,052
l can reset the cycle manually.

334
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:44,085
Payton:
You know how to do that?

335
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:46,962
- Yeah.
- lt's a long way.

336
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,899
Gonna have to get you past
a few security bulkheads.

337
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,267
With a little sidestepping,
we're gonna get you there.

338
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,802
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Delta 81643 Lima.

339
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,278
Okay okay, hold on.

340
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,508
l don't want you going too far.
Just catch your breath.

341
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:05,516
l don't need a rest.
Just tell me which way.

342
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,745
l don't know yet.
Hold on.

343
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:19,027
Payton.

344
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:27,404
Pandorum, you ever
felt the symptoms?

345
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,206
Of all the things to remember,
why would you pick that?

346
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:36,874
Were you thinking
of the Eden mission?

347
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,849
What about the Eden?

348
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:45,051
You just had to remind me of the biggest
fucking catastrophe in space travel.

349
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,982
The flight cautionary tale from hell.

350
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,495
l remember.
Didn't they have some kind of

351
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,966
hypersleep malfunction?

352
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,060
Payton: Two years into their shift
one of their officers

353
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:00,469
had a psychological breakdown.

354
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:03,804
The doctors refer
to it as ODS syndrome.

355
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:07,710
But the pilots,
we call it pandorum.

356
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:12,611
lt drove him insane. He became
convinced the flight was cursed.

357
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:16,044
- Evil.
- Bower: What did he do?

358
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,714
( alarm blaring )

359
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:19,917
Payton:
He evacuated the ship.

360
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:26,329
He launched them all
into oblivion.

361
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:29,492
5,000 people sent to their death

362
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,399
with one push of a button.

363
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:37,404
Bower: At least we didn't wake up
floating away in a coffin.

364
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,005
Payton:
Who says we didn't?

365
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,625
- Which way?
- Left at the third marker.

366
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:57,651
Just two more levels up
and we're on the main walkway.

367
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,163
Should be easy from there.

368
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,368
This can't be right.

369
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:13,673
What's not right?

370
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:16,772
l don't know if l'm hallucinating.

371
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,509
What?
What's going on?

372
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:23,316
l've seen this before.
This is a--

373
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:32,625
this--

374
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:35,155
this is a different one.

375
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:44,004
lt's booby-trapped.

376
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,135
Rigged the ceiling.

377
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,610
Payton: Be careful.

378
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:53,048
No! No!

379
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:55,109
No!

380
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:56,518
Quiet!

381
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,418
- Quiet! Shh.
- ( panting )

382
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,791
We have to shut the hell up.
Do you understand?

383
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:06,319
l'm gonna get you out of this,
but you have to be quiet.

384
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:08,423
You understand?

385
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:13,430
Payton:
Bower, you sure this is a good idea?

386
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:19,143
Watch yourself.

387
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:25,007
He's team 6.

388
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,679
That's the shift unit
that's supposed to follow us.

389
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,984
Payton: He could be--

390
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:32,649
Quiet. Quiet!

391
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:35,819
Easy. l'm not gonna hurt you
but you have to be quiet.

392
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,260
Do you hear me?

393
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:44,093
Shepard, team 6, sir.

394
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:47,667
l believe l'm the only one.

395
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:50,368
l knew it.
l knew you'd come back.

396
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,603
- What?
- Where's your squad?

397
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:55,408
Squad?
This is my lieutenant.

398
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:58,041
- Where's your shuttle?
- Shuttle? What are you talking about?

399
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,880
You're the retraction crew, right?

400
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,046
No. No.
l'm team 5.

401
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:06,114
- You just woke up?
- Six or eight hours ago.

402
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:07,419
So you don't know
what the fuck is going on?

403
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:08,858
That's what l'm saying.

404
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:11,862
- You know as much as me, man.
- l don't know anything.

405
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,956
You, you're gonna fit right in.

406
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:18,801
What are you doing?

407
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:20,168
- Get the scent off.
- Scent?

408
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:22,105
They're fast and they're fucking
stronger than you know.

409
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,405
They come after you, you run.
You run and you don't fucking look back.

410
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:27,070
l can't wait for you.

411
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:30,138
Who-- who are they?

412
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,808
- l can't help you.
- Help me.

413
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,819
Payton: Bower, you tell that asshole
the chain of command

414
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:37,253
- and a direct order is being made.
- You're still an officer on this ship,

415
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,449
and at the current time
your CO is ordering you...

416
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,652
- Ordering me? That's funny.
- ...now is ordering you--

417
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,593
You're late.
There's no fucking CO on this ship.

418
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:44,925
Fuck you.

419
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:47,227
( roaring )

420
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:56,631
( whimpering )

421
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:01,770
That's not gonna save you.

422
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:08,342
( snarling, growling )

423
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:09,978
Payton:
Get the hell out of there.

424
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,588
Get out of there!

425
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,005
Ah!

426
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:36,742
( roaring )

427
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:44,952
( whispering )
Go.

428
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:53,491
( screaming )

429
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:09,002
( thuds )

430
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:12,847
( groans )

431
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,217
( roars )

432
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,222
Just run.
Go!

433
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,636
( screaming )

434
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,828
( winces )

435
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,660
- ( roaring )
- ( screams )

436
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,214
( speaking Vietnamese )

437
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:21,110
( speaking Vietnamese )

438
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:36,199
l don't understand.

439
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:59,346
Thanks.

440
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:11,832
l-- l don't understand.

441
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,039
l don't know what you're saying.

442
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:19,600
l-- l don't understand.

443
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,979
Agriculture.

444
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:27,609
You're with agriculture.

445
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:32,254
Yeah.
Yeah, l'm with the flight crew.

446
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,657
But l don't know--
l don't know what happened.

447
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:40,130
Yeah, l know that,
but l'm not in charge here.

448
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:42,655
l'm trying to find out
what happened to the ship.

449
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,998
S-ship.

450
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,799
Ship.

451
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:49,432
l'm on my way to the reactor.

452
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:51,169
Reactor.

453
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:53,234
Reactor, that's right.
Exactly right.

454
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:56,075
But that doesn't concern you.
You stay here.

455
00:38:56,114 --> 00:39:00,551
You stay put and wait for the...

456
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,189
security to reengage.

457
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:08,989
And l'm gonna handle this problem.

458
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:10,551
Okay?

459
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,326
( electricity crackling )

460
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:25,069
( grunting )

461
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:30,447
( groans )

462
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:35,352
( panting )
God damn it.

463
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,319
( clanking )

464
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:51,165
Who's there?

465
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:55,429
( roars )

466
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,873
( clanking )

467
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:00,776
ldentify yourself.

468
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,939
Bower?

469
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,574
ls that you, Bower?

470
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:10,077
That can't be you.

471
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:11,247
- ( shouts )
- ( grunts )

472
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,896
( groans )

473
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:35,233
You again.

474
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:58,452
( pulsates )

475
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:07,267
l understand that it's felt

476
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:09,705
like every man for himself.

477
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,608
lf we're going to get out of this...

478
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:17,808
a little fucking solidarity

479
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:20,317
goes a long way.

480
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:26,256
We all want to survive,

481
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,656
right?

482
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,127
l lost contact with my CO.

483
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:33,995
So l need someone to tell me
how to get to the reactor.

484
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,767
You know?
That's great.

485
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:42,671
All right, we can work together

486
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:44,971
as a team.

487
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:48,274
( roaring )

488
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,246
( speaking Vietnamese )

489
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:56,181
Go.

490
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:03,560
( speaking Vietnamese )

491
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,696
Yeah.

492
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:15,999
Yeah well, no sympathy here, pal.

493
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,270
She left me with
a few sore spots too.

494
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,636
Why the hell should l trust you?

495
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,446
- Listen, lady, we don't want any--
- Are you really part of the flight crew?

496
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:29,248
Corporal Bower,
ship's mechanical engineer.

497
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:38,757
l didn't think
there was any flight crew left.

498
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:42,188
What's happened to us?

499
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:44,565
A malfunction of some sort.

500
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:48,003
You think?
What's your plan?

501
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:50,599
Fire up the reactor.
Go from there.

502
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:52,768
- You just wake up?
- Yeah.

503
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,643
- Just joined the party.
- You'll never make it.

504
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,274
- Why is that?
- You're going the wrong direction.

505
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:01,914
- Wait a second.
- Keep it down.

506
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,887
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

507
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:06,389
- l need you to show me the way.
- To the reactor?

508
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:08,585
l don't like going that far down.

509
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:13,089
No one ever comes back.

510
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,361
We don't have much time.

511
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,233
We could lose everything onboard.
Do you know what l'm saying to you?

512
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,397
Can you fly it?

513
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:24,306
Can you fly the ship?

514
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:25,832
Land it if you have to?

515
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,176
Yeah.

516
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:36,817
How long have you been awake?

517
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:39,880
Don't know.
There's no way to tell time in here.

518
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:41,892
- Five, maybe six months.
- Months?

519
00:44:41,926 --> 00:44:44,554
Quiet.
You want to get us killed?

520
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:46,358
( roaring in distance )

521
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:50,431
What are we doing?

522
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:53,528
- We are waiting.
- Waiting for what?

523
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,676
You want to get to the reactor?
Then trust me.

524
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,042
( speaking Vietnamese )

525
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:05,649
( roaring in distance )

526
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:09,312
Oh shit.
Hey, we have to go.

527
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:10,911
Trust me.

528
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:13,082
We've got to go now.

529
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:15,957
- We've got to go now.
- Wait.

530
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:17,790
- ( roaring louder )
- We've got to go now.

531
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:25,432
( rumbling )

532
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:44,818
What the hell are they?

533
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:47,255
Never quite felt like sticking
around to find out.

534
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,885
Running is always the best option.

535
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:51,827
They can't be from this ship.

536
00:45:59,503 --> 00:46:01,061
What is all this?

537
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:03,164
Ecological development.

538
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:06,574
Embryonic charter, livestock
and wildlife repopulation.

539
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,046
You live here?
You protect all this?

540
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:13,614
To us it seemed worth protecting.

541
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:15,312
Us?

542
00:46:16,754 --> 00:46:19,120
When l woke up,
there were five if us.

543
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:23,450
l was part of the Brandenburg lnstitute's
genetic sampling team.

544
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:26,657
Seven years collecting
and readying earth's biosphere--

545
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:29,723
just didn't feel right handing it off.

546
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:34,799
l volunteered to go along with it.

547
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:41,707
This...

548
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:43,906
truly is Noah's Ark.

549
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:48,146
This archive holds the world
we are going to live in.

550
00:46:48,185 --> 00:46:51,951
We've already lost about
30% of the specimens.

551
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:56,356
The lab has its own generator,
but without the reactor working,

552
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:59,055
l don't know if they
will ever make it to Tanis.

553
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:00,996
Tanis.

554
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,522
You couldn't remember?

555
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:05,626
l couldn't remember how--

556
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,103
how far away it was.

557
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:10,869
This was a 1 23-year flight.

558
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:13,035
Consider yourself lucky.

559
00:47:13,077 --> 00:47:15,671
lt took me months to recall.

560
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:18,307
lt took even longer to get
that goddamn door open.

561
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:21,250
lt comes on in pieces.

562
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:25,353
l know everything about this vault
and its systems.

563
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:29,091
But l still can't remember
where l grew up...

564
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:33,054
or my brother's name.

565
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:36,191
Are you hungry?

566
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:38,224
Yeah, l'm starving.

567
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:44,331
Here.

568
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,775
Good for protein.

569
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:03,285
How could we become like this
in only eight years?

570
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,990
This ship was built to outlast
our children's children.

571
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:11,966
l think we've been asleep
longer than you think.

572
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:15,939
( clanging )

573
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,322
You want in?

574
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:43,663
Come and get it, you fuck!

575
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,040
Help!
Help me!

576
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:02,813
Help!

577
00:49:14,865 --> 00:49:17,425
Who the hell are you?

578
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:19,436
l'm part of the flight crew.

579
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,836
Please help me.

580
00:49:21,872 --> 00:49:23,806
You're all right.
You're all right. Easy.

581
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:26,776
- ( whimpering )
- Hey, hang on.

582
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,835
Hang on.
Who are you?

583
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:32,371
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

584
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:36,615
Gallo.

585
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:39,782
Gallo? ls that it?

586
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:42,792
Corporal Gallo?

587
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:46,057
Yes.

588
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:47,723
Where'd you come from, Gallo?

589
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:49,665
From the--

590
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,725
from the bridge.

591
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:55,136
Bridge?
What happened?

592
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:57,800
Where are we?
Can you tell me?

593
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:00,742
- ( whimpering )
- Corporal.

594
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:05,306
Tell me.
What happened?

595
00:50:18,395 --> 00:50:19,987
Bowen:
Where are we?

596
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,658
Hypersleep chamber,
personnel.

597
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:29,198
Careful.

598
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:32,534
And don't slow me down.

599
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:45,221
Bower:
Most of these are empty.

600
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:46,745
Where the hell is everyone?

601
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,758
This is their main
hunting ground.

602
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:52,621
Keep moving.

603
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:01,964
Hey, my wife could be in here.

604
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:05,133
She's a development settler?
Engineer?

605
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:10,044
No, she's not part of the crew.
But spouses were brought with.

606
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,479
She's not here then.

607
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:14,040
Do you know where
the family members are?

608
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:15,779
Quiet.

609
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,661
We have to keep moving.

610
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:31,930
We don't want to stay
in the open for too long.

611
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,437
Especially in here.

612
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:42,269
We have to get going.

613
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:49,852
We can't just leave him.

614
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,946
Fuck that.
He's hunting.

615
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:54,253
You wait for him?
Good luck.

616
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,657
Wait.

617
00:51:58,695 --> 00:52:01,528
( metal creaking )

618
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:03,055
( gasps )

619
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:15,504
( metal creaks )

620
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,713
( sputtering )

621
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:22,981
You all right?

622
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:26,679
l'm all right.

623
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:31,352
( gagging )
Oh God.

624
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,260
There must be hundreds
of them in here.

625
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:42,372
( roaring )

626
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:46,876
( rumbling )

627
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:20,302
Where did they go?

628
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:24,603
We have to get out of here.

629
00:53:38,328 --> 00:53:40,319
- ( roaring )
- ( gasps )

630
00:53:47,738 --> 00:53:49,399
( roaring )

631
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:18,634
- ( roaring )
- ( groans )

632
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:20,261
( shouting )

633
00:54:48,966 --> 00:54:50,831
( shouts )

634
00:54:59,343 --> 00:55:01,106
( groans )

635
00:55:15,726 --> 00:55:18,286
- ( shouts )
- ( roars )

636
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:25,865
( roaring )

637
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:01,864
( growling )

638
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:09,806
( bangs )

639
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:11,837
We should run.

640
00:56:15,118 --> 00:56:17,450
- ( roars )
- Go!

641
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:06,501
- What are you doing?
- We can't leave him.

642
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:10,964
( screaming )

643
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:21,173
( roars )

644
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:23,987
Bower, do you copy?

645
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:25,318
Bower, do you copy?

646
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:30,592
You out there?

647
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,222
Flight team 4.

648
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:08,094
What are you doing?

649
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:09,598
Just checking you.

650
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:11,362
For what?

651
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:13,961
Make sure you're okay.
You passed out.

652
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,835
You were hysterical.

653
00:58:15,872 --> 00:58:19,171
- Who the hell are you?
- l'm Payton.

654
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:22,269
- Lieutenant Payton.
- You're a lieutenant?

655
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:24,473
You're team 4.

656
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:26,345
You're supposed
to be my predecessor.

657
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:31,882
You said you came from the bridge.

658
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:34,322
- Yeah, so?
- So where the hell are we?

659
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:37,019
- l can't get any navigation in here.
- l don't know.

660
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,654
Well, what did you see?
How did this whole thing get screwed up?

661
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:43,223
Listen, l am not a navigator.

662
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:46,064
- The stars all look alike.
- Take it easy, all right?

663
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:48,832
Just want to make sure you're okay.

664
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:51,238
- l'm fine.
- ls that your blood, Corporal?

665
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:57,472
Some of it is, sir.

666
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:00,244
Who else's blood is it?

667
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:02,513
There was something
wrong with them.

668
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:05,146
Something wrong with who?

669
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:07,713
Your crew?

670
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:10,351
lt was pandorum.

671
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:13,226
l had to defend myself.

672
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:15,231
l did.

673
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:18,530
Pandorum?
Both of 'em?

674
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:21,264
You don't believe me, do you?

675
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,300
lf you would have seen them...

676
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:32,282
you would have done
the same thing, sir.

677
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:36,517
( water splashing )

678
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:43,825
l thought you knew
where we were going.

679
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,852
l was trying to save our asses.

680
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:48,728
( speaking Vietnamese )

681
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:06,980
( roaring in distance )

682
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:30,932
( speaks Vietnamese )

683
01:00:30,974 --> 01:00:33,568
Whoa whoa, easy, okay?

684
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,578
No weapons.
No weapons.

685
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,847
Excuse me.
Just please, come.

686
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:43,751
Come in.
Okay.

687
01:00:43,787 --> 01:00:47,314
Please, make yourselves at home.

688
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,522
You live here?

689
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,858
- Who said that? What?
- You live here?

690
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:56,263
l know it's not much to look at.

691
01:00:56,299 --> 01:00:58,733
But...

692
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:00,599
they can't get in here

693
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:02,298
unless l want them to.

694
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:03,704
Why would you want them to?

695
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,140
l had no idea
there was any crew left.

696
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:09,202
Have you met any other flyers?

697
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:10,974
No.

698
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:15,780
Not in a long long time.

699
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:19,220
Why don't you come on
down so we can meet properly?

700
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:22,224
You think l survived this long
trusting strangers?

701
01:01:22,258 --> 01:01:23,691
Wait.

702
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:28,390
l have a question for you.
Where you got to be?

703
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:31,662
Reactor bay.
Know how to get there?

704
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,760
Yeah, l do.

705
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:38,105
Why would you want
to go to the reactor?

706
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:40,939
Oh, l get it.
l get it.

707
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:44,435
You just woke up, huh?
You hungry?

708
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:46,779
'Cause l can cook.

709
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:49,580
l really got a treat for you guys.

710
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:52,952
but l must admit it's really
difficult to season

711
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:54,980
when you're only using
a motor oil base.

712
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:58,085
But if we use our imagination,

713
01:01:58,128 --> 01:02:00,528
we got something here.

714
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:02,531
lt kinda tastes like...

715
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:04,465
( sniffs )

716
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,560
herb and butter dogshit.

717
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:08,798
How long have you been awake?

718
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:11,136
Let me see-- what's today?

719
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:13,404
Tuesday, so l have no idea.

720
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:21,608
Ah, well, let's eat, shall we?

721
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:24,313
( speaks Vietnamese )
lt's kosher.

722
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:27,585
l'm a cook, you know.
Says so right here on my tattoo.

723
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:31,454
ls that safe?

724
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:33,462
Compared to what?

725
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:35,862
Those things out there,

726
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:38,527
could it have been something

727
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:42,129
that crawled out of your tank or lab
or something?

728
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:44,163
No, that's not possible.

729
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:48,800
Then it's some kind of life form
that got onboard.

730
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:50,506
Or something.

731
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,606
Or something
that was already onboard

732
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:54,844
with us in the hyperbunks.

733
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:56,784
What do you mean?

734
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,812
l believe it's the accelerator.

735
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:02,916
The synthetic enzyme
in our feeding tubes

736
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:05,052
that would help our bodies
adjust and adapt

737
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:06,995
to the environmental
conditions on Tanis.

738
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,828
From what l've seen,

739
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:13,302
these things have adapted
to the ship instead.

740
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:18,462
So you're saying that they're passengers
who have mutated?

741
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:21,306
That stuff in our blood is supposed
to jump-start evolution.

742
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:24,472
Well, why would they
be affected and we're not?

743
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:27,540
Maybe they've been awake
much longer than we think.

744
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:30,553
- Longer than him.
- Huh.

745
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:32,555
- You don't know what happened to us?
- You do?

746
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:36,047
Oh, l've been around
for a while.

747
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:39,195
l know what l've seen.

748
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:49,828
What do you think you're doing?

749
01:03:49,873 --> 01:03:51,534
What is that?

750
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:54,338
lt's just a sedative
to help you relax.

751
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:57,005
Then you take it
and relax.

752
01:03:57,046 --> 01:04:00,709
Take it down a notch.
We're on the same team here.

753
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:04,413
Do you know
the symptoms of pandorum?

754
01:04:04,454 --> 01:04:06,649
- What?
- Orbital dysfunctional syndrome.

755
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:08,384
- Pandorum.
- l've seen it before.

756
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:11,018
Ever witness
the symptoms firsthand?

757
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,119
lt's not something
you can easily detect.

758
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:15,631
lt starts with a shiver, an itch,

759
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:17,496
a slow boil--

760
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:20,594
the biological side effects
of flying deep space

761
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,195
feeding into paranoia.

762
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:24,763
And the paranoid
brain feeding the side effects.

763
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:27,469
A downward spiral.
A descent into madness.

764
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,843
There is no shutting off the heat
no matter what you do.

765
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,474
lt'll boil over.

766
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:35,643
You don't believe me.

767
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:38,051
l didn't say that.

768
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,817
How could they both have had it?
The odds are insurmountable.

769
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:42,722
l wasn't about
to question your actions.

770
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:45,227
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

771
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:47,491
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

772
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,363
- lt has an emotional trigger effect.
- That's what they say.

773
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,131
How do you think you would react
if you knew the truth?

774
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:00,567
The truth about what?

775
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:03,477
Leland: Boom.
Oh, how the whole world cheered

776
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:06,539
to the thunder of earth's
mightiest creation--

777
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,141
Elysium.

778
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:10,448
One small spark

779
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:13,387
to ignite the heavens
for the heroes

780
01:05:13,423 --> 01:05:15,687
to venture farther and farther

781
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:18,421
than any of mankind's machines.

782
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:21,430
And we slept.
We slept a slumber so deep

783
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:23,227
that no one had dared before

784
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:27,202
as three little lndians
were left to mind the store.

785
01:05:27,237 --> 01:05:28,761
Gallo:
We were only into our second term.

786
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:30,033
All flight systems nominal.

787
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,803
l picked up symptoms
with my CO and 2nd lieutenant.

788
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:36,676
Mild symptoms. Nothing l thought
would become a problem.

789
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:40,080
- Until we got the transmission.
- What transmission?

790
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,607
Leland:
Mother Earth's final call.

791
01:05:42,652 --> 01:05:46,816
All God's creation ending
with mere words of encouragement.

792
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:50,223
( garbled talking )

793
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,755
What does it say?

794
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:11,104
You're all that's left of us.

795
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:16,507
Good luck.
God bless.

796
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:19,146
And Godspeed.

797
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:21,554
Earth...

798
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,155
is gone?

799
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,322
Poof.
Wiped away.

800
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:31,231
We ran a full sweep of the grid
and they were gone.

801
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:34,065
One day there,
the next nothing.

802
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:36,264
ln one day?

803
01:06:36,306 --> 01:06:38,934
lt had to be nuclear
or an asteroid.

804
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,465
Does it matter?

805
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:42,944
My fellow crew members
didn't take the news too well.

806
01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:46,005
l wanted to wake the primary crew,

807
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:48,574
but my 2nd lieutenant
was already over the edge.

808
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:52,019
Leland: Three little lndians
with the burden to bear.

809
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:54,421
No more law.
Nothing left to care.

810
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:58,052
Just three little souls whose
destiny had become undone

811
01:06:58,094 --> 01:07:02,121
because there was
chop chop chop chop...

812
01:07:03,266 --> 01:07:05,496
then there was only one.

813
01:07:05,535 --> 01:07:08,060
One little lndian left.

814
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:10,038
They were my commanding officers,

815
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:12,371
men who had guided me
through FT.

816
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:15,536
But it wasn't them anymore.
They were gone.

817
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:18,445
- l had no choice!
- Corporal Gallo!

818
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:22,212
Leland: One little lndian left,
alone with all his doom.

819
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:25,049
He refuses to go to bed,
so what does he do?

820
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:29,024
He decides to stay up
and play in his room.

821
01:07:29,058 --> 01:07:31,652
What nasty little games
he would play

822
01:07:31,694 --> 01:07:33,628
with his slumbering prey.

823
01:07:33,663 --> 01:07:36,029
He was slayer, he was master.

824
01:07:36,065 --> 01:07:38,932
He was both God and the devil.

825
01:07:38,968 --> 01:07:41,903
See, that's what some would say.
He would grow to manhood,

826
01:07:41,938 --> 01:07:43,963
- a self-proclaimed king.
- ( coughing )

827
01:07:44,006 --> 01:07:47,669
Master of his own vessel.
Home to his own sin.

828
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:50,611
He just cast out
all who had behaved.

829
01:07:50,646 --> 01:07:54,082
Just exiled to the cargo hold

830
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:55,914
- to fend amongst themselves...
- ( coughing )

831
01:07:55,952 --> 01:08:00,286
...and scavenge,
feeding off their own.

832
01:08:00,323 --> 01:08:02,587
Evil grew.

833
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:06,083
The king no longer wanted to play.

834
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:09,621
So he returned
to his bed of slumber.

835
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:12,225
And while the king slept,

836
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:15,260
a whole new world of evil grew

837
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:17,033
as we wept.

838
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:20,769
Gallo's voice:
lt starts with a shiver, an itch.

839
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:22,937
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

840
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:25,243
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

841
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:27,442
lt has an emotional trigger effect.

842
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:34,852
( rumbling )

843
01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:52,833
( chains rattling )

844
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:03,047
- ( machinery humming )
- ( grunting )

845
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:10,450
What are you doing?

846
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,464
He's gonna fucking eat us.

847
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:18,763
lt's not personal, guys.

848
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:22,532
lt's just survival of the fittest.

849
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:26,372
Or maybe it's the brightest.

850
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:28,570
You understand what l'm saying?

851
01:09:29,612 --> 01:09:31,671
- You gassed us.
- Oh, yes.

852
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:33,477
And l'm sorry,
but l'm a little too old

853
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,041
and too tired for the honorable way
of hunting game.

854
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:39,680
You better make sure l'm dead...

855
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:42,850
( shouting in Vietnamese )

856
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:46,089
You don't have to do this.
We have to save the ship.

857
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:49,859
Don't sweat it
and save me the speeches.

858
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:52,697
l wouldn't have survived this long
if l had a heart.

859
01:09:54,136 --> 01:09:57,833
You know, a strange thing,
the survival instinct.

860
01:09:57,874 --> 01:10:01,674
l mean, there's nothing really left
to live for.

861
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:05,272
Don't be fucking stupid.
l can save the fucking ship.

862
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:12,919
Question is,
what would be more stupid?

863
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:15,446
Trusting the ship will hold
to see another day

864
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:18,790
when it's kept me alive
for all these years?

865
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,955
Or trusting somebody

866
01:10:20,997 --> 01:10:23,124
who's desperate enough
to say anything

867
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:26,396
just when l'm about to carve
a steak out of his girlfriend?

868
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:30,028
Listen to the ship.

869
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,869
What about the ship?

870
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:35,741
The power surges--

871
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:38,872
the reactor is in its final stage.

872
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:42,043
We have less time than l thought.

873
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:46,020
The final phase before shutdown,

874
01:10:46,055 --> 01:10:48,421
before we lose everything

875
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,891
and everyone onboard.

876
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:54,829
lf we don't reset it now,

877
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:58,095
everything is lost.

878
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:02,400
She has been all moody lately.

879
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:04,963
Very moody.

880
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:07,703
Hey, listen.

881
01:11:07,743 --> 01:11:10,234
Hey, l get it.

882
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:13,840
What? You get what?

883
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:17,080
You did what you had to do.

884
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:20,782
You made it.
No one's gonna judge you.

885
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,348
No one's gonna judge you.

886
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:25,860
You are a survivor.

887
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,697
And right now we...

888
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:33,600
have to reset the reactor.

889
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:42,510
How long before the ship dies?

890
01:11:42,545 --> 01:11:44,240
The truth.

891
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,942
l don't know.

892
01:11:46,983 --> 01:11:49,747
Take a fucking guess.

893
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:54,187
An hour. Less.

894
01:12:06,102 --> 01:12:08,570
- Well?
- We're in this together.

895
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:10,902
l need your radio.
We don't have much time.

896
01:12:17,113 --> 01:12:19,172
Bower:
Payton, do you copy?

897
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:20,807
Do you copy?
Can you hear me?

898
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:23,978
Payton, do you copy?
Can you hear me?

899
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,215
l'm here.
Where are you?

900
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:29,019
Storage tank
somewhere below B level.

901
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:31,583
Midship sector 1 2, l think.

902
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:34,221
How the hell did you get all the way
to the other side of the ship?

903
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:36,254
The reactor is shutting down fast.

904
01:12:36,298 --> 01:12:39,290
l need you to access the memory banks
from the last power surge

905
01:12:39,335 --> 01:12:42,566
- and run a Kolzer complex test.
- Accessing memory banks now.

906
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:44,664
Running Kolzer complex.

907
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:52,878
You're not gonna like this.

908
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:55,179
Test says you have
less than 47 minutes

909
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:57,344
before complete system failure.

910
01:12:57,386 --> 01:13:00,014
- That's not much time.
- How do we get you in there?

911
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:02,456
- l need you to give us a path.
- Copy.

912
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:07,688
Move it.

913
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:31,378
( screeches )

914
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:35,623
No. lt's a child.

915
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:38,149
Child?
That's no fucking child.

916
01:13:38,194 --> 01:13:40,219
( screeching )

917
01:13:45,668 --> 01:13:47,295
They are breeding.

918
01:13:47,336 --> 01:13:49,600
Little bastard.
He went and got daddy.

919
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:51,572
( roars )

920
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:04,582
This is not gonna work.
There's too many of them.

921
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,145
We must be close
to where they live.

922
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:09,919
Great.
Now we're fucking stuck here.

923
01:14:12,728 --> 01:14:14,855
Gallo: What's so important
on the other side of that door?

924
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:17,388
The bridge.
We can take control of guidance

925
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:18,832
as soon as we get on the bridge.

926
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:21,428
How's that going to help?
This ship is dying.

927
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,995
We should be focusing
on how to save ourselves.

928
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:27,133
Oh, that's right.
The Boy Scout is going to save us.

929
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,076
He can do it.

930
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:33,943
24 hours ago
he didn't know his own name.

931
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:36,850
Now you think he's ready
to reconfigure

932
01:14:36,886 --> 01:14:39,218
a nuclear reactor?

933
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:41,416
Leland:
lf they don't leave soon,

934
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:43,516
there's no point in even going.

935
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,591
What are you doing?

936
01:14:46,629 --> 01:14:49,223
These are our families

937
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:51,733
from flight personnel.

938
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:54,964
They're all dead.

939
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:58,232
You think she's here?

940
01:14:58,274 --> 01:15:00,742
No, she's--

941
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,573
she's not here.

942
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,171
How do you know for sure?

943
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:08,479
'Cause she wouldn't come with me.

944
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:20,752
She's not on this flight.

945
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:22,821
She left me.

946
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:24,924
( wind howling )

947
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:41,408
There was nothing left for me,

948
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,384
so l enlisted.

949
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:46,354
She's the reason why l left.

950
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:51,293
Well, then she saved your life.

951
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:53,818
That's very tragic.

952
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:56,798
But we've got to move on.
l'm sick of this shit.

953
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:58,129
- For what?
- What?

954
01:15:58,167 --> 01:15:59,964
- For what?
- Shh.

955
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:02,027
- They're all gone.
- Shh.

956
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:05,507
- There's nothing left.
- Shh! Shut your fucking mouth.

957
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:07,805
There's nothing left to go back to.

958
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,243
You're wrong.

959
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:13,214
Hey, we were meant to go on.

960
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:17,980
And we were meant to survive.

961
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,045
And now it's more
important than ever.

962
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:22,080
Leland:
We're wasting time.

963
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:24,649
- l remember.
- What?

964
01:16:26,662 --> 01:16:28,926
Clock's ticking.

965
01:16:33,002 --> 01:16:35,971
Payton's wife Marianne.

966
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:44,640
l remember.

967
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:49,917
Bower was right about one thing:

968
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:52,284
Once this thing shuts down
we are as good as dead.

969
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:54,482
What are you muttering about?

970
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:57,959
l'm saying once it's done
we're done.

971
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:00,325
But we still have a way out of this.

972
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:03,525
You're suggesting what, Corporal?

973
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:05,726
We can launch ourselves in the pods

974
01:17:05,768 --> 01:17:09,169
before the ignition systems
are completely dead, sir.

975
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:11,297
That's suicide.

976
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,739
We can buy a few days,

977
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:14,766
which is better
than what we have left here.

978
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:21,045
Leland:
The reactor is close.

979
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,550
You can hear it breathe.

980
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,860
Yeah, this is it...

981
01:17:40,102 --> 01:17:43,196
a descent into hell itself.

982
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:59,082
How long do you think that reactor
has been sitting there, huh?

983
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:01,646
That thing could melt down

984
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:03,351
when he tries to fire the core.

985
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:07,424
This ship could be ripped in half.

986
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:10,830
Stand down, Corporal.
We are not abandoning anything

987
01:18:10,866 --> 01:18:13,061
and we are not leaving them behind.

988
01:18:13,102 --> 01:18:15,969
We can't stay on this ship!
You know that!

989
01:18:16,005 --> 01:18:18,872
l said stand down, Corporal!

990
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:22,003
That's an order.

991
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:35,381
( electricity crackling )

992
01:18:43,799 --> 01:18:45,858
- Whoa!
- ( metal creaks )

993
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:51,571
( growling )

994
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:52,835
Christ Almighty.

995
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,926
( grunts )

996
01:19:24,173 --> 01:19:25,697
Don't let go.

997
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,874
( beeping )

998
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:04,835
He's in.

999
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:07,713
We're gonna get ourselves
out of this.

1000
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:09,376
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

1001
01:20:09,418 --> 01:20:12,444
How can l trust someone who
isn't even honest with himself?

1002
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:15,048
We still have time.

1003
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,991
- You have to listen to me.
- Don't do that.

1004
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:19,721
Don't do what?

1005
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:23,094
Don't talk to me like l'm some child
that needs reassurance.

1006
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:24,724
Then calm the fuck down.

1007
01:20:24,766 --> 01:20:27,792
l know this ship and l know what
she's capable of better than anyone.

1008
01:20:27,836 --> 01:20:31,397
l know what she can and can't do.
Why are we even arguing?

1009
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,670
lf you want to stay here
to die that is your choice.

1010
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:37,008
- l gave you an order.
- Not mine. Not mine!

1011
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:38,512
Corporal.

1012
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:40,515
Who's the one being
irrational here, Lieutenant?

1013
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:42,642
Who's the one being delusional?

1014
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:45,482
l'm getting off this ship.
The flight is over.

1015
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:46,852
Over!

1016
01:20:54,129 --> 01:20:56,859
( speaking Vietnamese )

1017
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:04,435
( growling )

1018
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:50,278
- Don't shoot yourself into space.
- Shut up.

1019
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:53,049
- l'm getting off this ship.
- Bower's going to reboot the reactor.

1020
01:21:53,088 --> 01:21:54,783
Shut up.

1021
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:58,683
lt wasn't the crew
that was sick, was it?

1022
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:00,752
- Finish the code.
- Look at yourself.

1023
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:03,663
- You're the one with the symptoms.
- Finish it!

1024
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:12,265
( pod humming )

1025
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,371
What are you doing?

1026
01:22:20,415 --> 01:22:22,349
lt's for your own good.

1027
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:24,648
What the fuck are you doing?

1028
01:22:24,686 --> 01:22:26,620
You're not well.

1029
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:29,180
You just need the proper treatment.

1030
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:34,426
Let me out, God damn it!

1031
01:22:34,463 --> 01:22:37,955
Open it!
That is an order, motherfucker!

1032
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,992
lt's not your fault.

1033
01:22:41,036 --> 01:22:44,528
l will cut you to fucking bits.
Open it!

1034
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:46,404
Open it!
l will carve you up!

1035
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:48,841
Your mind has turned
against itself.

1036
01:22:48,877 --> 01:22:51,311
You're killing us!

1037
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,644
We are all going to die, Corporal.

1038
01:23:04,593 --> 01:23:06,652
Holy fuck.

1039
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:31,742
( straining )

1040
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:54,141
- Oh, shit.
- ( clanking )

1041
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:56,201
( roars )

1042
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,211
( roaring )

1043
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:24,295
( shouts in Vietnamese )

1044
01:24:24,339 --> 01:24:26,603
( roars )

1045
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:53,494
They're coming.

1046
01:25:01,943 --> 01:25:03,570
Hurry up!

1047
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:04,840
Shit.

1048
01:25:05,847 --> 01:25:07,109
( howls )

1049
01:25:09,418 --> 01:25:11,579
Come on, come on, come on.

1050
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,054
( humming loudly )

1051
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:28,537
( computers powering up )

1052
01:25:28,537 --> 01:25:31,563
( computers powering up )

1053
01:25:39,748 --> 01:25:43,445
He did it.
Boy Scout did it.

1054
01:25:43,485 --> 01:25:46,420
You were right.
Now let me out.

1055
01:25:46,455 --> 01:25:48,821
l can help.

1056
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:50,848
l'll help you.

1057
01:25:54,162 --> 01:25:56,289
What are you doing?

1058
01:25:56,331 --> 01:25:58,458
Are you still trying
to get on the bridge?

1059
01:25:59,668 --> 01:26:01,795
You do not want
to go in there, Corporal.

1060
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:06,406
What are you gonna tell them, huh?

1061
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:09,410
- Bower will be coming back here.
- Shut up.

1062
01:26:09,444 --> 01:26:11,309
They'll know what you did.

1063
01:26:11,346 --> 01:26:13,644
( laughs )

1064
01:26:15,317 --> 01:26:17,308
( creatures roaring )

1065
01:26:43,211 --> 01:26:45,679
( growling )

1066
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:52,352
( roars )

1067
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:53,979
( shouts )

1068
01:26:59,594 --> 01:27:00,891
( screams )

1069
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:13,506
Where do you think you're going?

1070
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:15,169
Quiet.

1071
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,542
Think about what you're doing, sir.

1072
01:27:18,713 --> 01:27:21,546
Shut the fuck up.

1073
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:25,310
They will never let you
get away with this.

1074
01:27:25,353 --> 01:27:26,615
Shut up!

1075
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,436
They're everywhere.

1076
01:28:08,897 --> 01:28:10,159
Asshole!

1077
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,970
( screaming )

1078
01:28:40,295 --> 01:28:42,422
( groans )

1079
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:52,267
( cooing )

1080
01:28:54,576 --> 01:28:56,635
( grunts )

1081
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:02,373
- ( screeches )
- ( gurgles )

1082
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:08,480
( door bangs )

1083
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:13,726
We both know who needs this shot.

1084
01:29:13,762 --> 01:29:17,027
- Stay back.
- Who's the one suffering here, sir?

1085
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:18,498
l mean it!

1086
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:22,893
What do you want from me?

1087
01:29:24,739 --> 01:29:27,537
Your mind has turned against itself.

1088
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:33,179
l'm gonna fucking carve you up.

1089
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:42,249
( both grunting )

1090
01:29:46,761 --> 01:29:48,752
Who are you?

1091
01:29:59,874 --> 01:30:02,570
Leland:
Ahem. Made it.

1092
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:05,875
Whoo.

1093
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:07,745
l was with your boy.

1094
01:30:07,782 --> 01:30:11,274
l helped him get all this started.

1095
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:13,014
l see you're a flyer too.

1096
01:30:13,054 --> 01:30:14,954
( groans )

1097
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:22,259
( pounding at door )

1098
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:41,039
Ah.

1099
01:30:59,367 --> 01:31:01,699
Where's your lieutenant?

1100
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:03,795
He's not my lieutenant.

1101
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:19,684
Where are we?

1102
01:31:19,721 --> 01:31:21,313
What's happened to us?

1103
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:23,916
The flight log

1104
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:27,052
will tell us how long we've been out
and how far we've gone.

1105
01:31:36,571 --> 01:31:38,266
( gasps )

1106
01:31:42,043 --> 01:31:44,238
lt seems

1107
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:47,407
my mild memory lapse

1108
01:31:47,448 --> 01:31:49,541
has finally worn off, Lieutenant.

1109
01:31:49,584 --> 01:31:51,609
Who the hell are you?

1110
01:31:51,653 --> 01:31:54,952
Gallo, Corporal.

1111
01:31:54,989 --> 01:31:57,480
l was younger than you
when l first came onboard.

1112
01:31:57,525 --> 01:32:01,461
Funny, l can't even remember what life
was like before this flight began.

1113
01:32:01,496 --> 01:32:03,361
lt's all l have.

1114
01:32:04,866 --> 01:32:07,061
You're the one who received
the final transmission.

1115
01:32:07,101 --> 01:32:08,796
You stayed awake.
You broke the rotation.

1116
01:32:08,837 --> 01:32:10,998
You killed your crew.

1117
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:14,167
How the hell would you know that?

1118
01:32:14,209 --> 01:32:16,177
Where are we?

1119
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,273
Go ahead, take a peek.

1120
01:32:21,316 --> 01:32:23,580
( metal grinding )

1121
01:32:29,424 --> 01:32:31,221
You tell me.

1122
01:32:36,631 --> 01:32:38,758
What have you done with us?

1123
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,597
You don't get it, kid.

1124
01:32:40,635 --> 01:32:42,865
There's no one left to judge.

1125
01:32:42,904 --> 01:32:46,465
Where are the stars?
Oh my God.

1126
01:32:46,507 --> 01:32:48,907
God?
You think God survived?

1127
01:32:48,943 --> 01:32:51,434
He's dead along with
the rest of humanity.

1128
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:53,344
There's no law or order,

1129
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:55,076
no good or evil.
Just us.

1130
01:32:55,116 --> 01:32:58,608
And you think you're going
to be the one to judge me?

1131
01:32:58,653 --> 01:32:59,915
You want to take a shot at me?

1132
01:32:59,954 --> 01:33:01,615
You know what?
l just might.

1133
01:33:01,656 --> 01:33:03,089
You are suffering, son.

1134
01:33:03,124 --> 01:33:06,685
l can see it in your face.
l've been there.

1135
01:33:06,728 --> 01:33:09,288
Just imagine just for a minute,

1136
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:12,390
imagine yourself without the chains
of your morality.

1137
01:33:12,433 --> 01:33:14,367
You'd even surprise yourself.

1138
01:33:14,402 --> 01:33:16,233
lt's the ultimate freedom.

1139
01:33:16,271 --> 01:33:18,205
No.

1140
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,366
This isn't freedom.

1141
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:22,399
This is pandorum.

1142
01:33:22,443 --> 01:33:26,243
Oh, pandorum. Pandorum isn't
what they warned us about.

1143
01:33:26,281 --> 01:33:28,306
l know it's frightening at first,
terrifying in fact.

1144
01:33:28,349 --> 01:33:31,147
lsn't that what you're feeling right now,
terrible fear?

1145
01:33:31,185 --> 01:33:34,780
Let go and on the other side
of it is divine clarity.

1146
01:33:34,822 --> 01:33:36,483
Purity.
Enlightenment.

1147
01:33:36,524 --> 01:33:38,492
Shut up!
What's out there?

1148
01:33:38,526 --> 01:33:41,154
You are resisting what is.

1149
01:33:41,195 --> 01:33:44,096
You have to let go of
your petty concept of reality.

1150
01:33:44,132 --> 01:33:46,293
That's just baggage
from the old world.

1151
01:33:46,334 --> 01:33:49,030
And we both know that didn't work
out very well now, did it?

1152
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:52,972
They fucked up our planet.
Life eats life.

1153
01:33:53,007 --> 01:33:56,238
And all that's left is what is.

1154
01:33:56,277 --> 01:33:58,336
This ship is a seed

1155
01:33:58,379 --> 01:34:00,939
from which we can create a new world.

1156
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:02,142
Shut up!
What's out there?!

1157
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:03,946
A new world.
A natural state.

1158
01:34:03,985 --> 01:34:06,180
- Raw, beautiful...
- What do you see?

1159
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:09,417
...perfect.
l am offering you the kingdom.

1160
01:34:09,457 --> 01:34:12,085
- ( banging )
- And all that's holding you back

1161
01:34:12,126 --> 01:34:13,787
is your own fear.

1162
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,964
Still the Boy Scout,
hey, kid?

1163
01:34:17,999 --> 01:34:20,559
There will always be law

1164
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:23,195
and you will pay
for what you've done.

1165
01:34:23,237 --> 01:34:26,968
Even if that means l have
to pull the sick out of you.

1166
01:34:27,008 --> 01:34:29,841
( gagging, groaning )

1167
01:34:29,877 --> 01:34:31,708
- Bower!
- What is it?

1168
01:34:33,681 --> 01:34:35,342
( groans )

1169
01:34:43,491 --> 01:34:45,857
( high-pitched whining )

1170
01:34:47,762 --> 01:34:50,128
( both gasp )

1171
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:55,860
We've already crashed.

1172
01:34:55,903 --> 01:34:59,566
We've been on Tanis
all this time.

1173
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:03,067
All this time.

1174
01:35:07,048 --> 01:35:09,778
l guess this thing
does land itself.

1175
01:35:09,817 --> 01:35:11,785
Doesn't float too well though,
does it?

1176
01:35:16,724 --> 01:35:18,419
Let go of your fear.

1177
01:35:19,627 --> 01:35:22,255
This is where l'll push through.

1178
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:28,258
Shh shh.

1179
01:35:28,302 --> 01:35:30,202
They're coming in.

1180
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:32,297
( pounding )

1181
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:36,570
Attaboy.

1182
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:09,605
( gasping )

1183
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:20,450
They're coming in.

1184
01:36:20,488 --> 01:36:23,218
What are you doing?

1185
01:36:32,033 --> 01:36:33,625
Why don't you shoot?

1186
01:36:41,242 --> 01:36:43,301
( cracking )

1187
01:36:48,883 --> 01:36:48,950
( metal groaning )

1188
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:51,009
( metal groaning )

1189
01:37:15,877 --> 01:37:17,902
( alarm sounding )

1190
01:37:31,025 --> 01:37:32,686
Are you crazy?

1191
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:42,063
- Do you see that?
- Fuck him.

1192
01:37:42,103 --> 01:37:44,128
- We need to get out of here.
- Hold on.

1193
01:37:44,172 --> 01:37:47,232
Not like this.
We can't die like this.

1194
01:37:47,275 --> 01:37:48,708
Hold on.

1195
01:37:53,548 --> 01:37:55,345
( growls )

1196
01:38:06,561 --> 01:38:07,960
( gasping )

1197
01:38:18,105 --> 01:38:20,539
( gasping )

1198
01:38:24,478 --> 01:38:27,242
What?
No, l can't--

1199
01:38:27,281 --> 01:38:29,010
Just breathe.

1200
01:39:17,098 --> 01:39:19,032
( coughing )

1201
01:39:29,577 --> 01:39:31,670
( coughs )

1202
01:39:34,048 --> 01:39:36,380
Hey. Hey.

1203
01:39:42,957 --> 01:39:44,447
Just breathe.

1204
01:39:47,228 --> 01:39:49,389
lt's safe to wake up now.

1205
01:41:26,627 --> 01:41:29,562
( instrumental music playing )
