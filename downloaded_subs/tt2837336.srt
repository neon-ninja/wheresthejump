00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:44,248
Dear...

4
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,051
..wake up

5
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:53,624
Finally wake up.

6
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:10,399
Happy to see your eyes...

7
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,869
- Where am I?
- At home.

8
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,086
Where?

9
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:25,455
You're unconscious.

10
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,959
Because of what happened.

11
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,788
- What happened?
- Terrible accident.

12
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,368
Bumping windshield.

13
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,986
The doctor said you might
have memory problems...

14
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:48,178
temporarily

15
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:59,323
Who are you?

16
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,462
Dear...

17
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm your wife...

18
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:15,064
I will help you feel better.

19
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:23,628
You know, noodle
is not found by an Italian?

20
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,971
Although popular in the West,

21
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,645
they are created by Chinese.

22
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:33,809
Doctor says to make your mind as calm as possible

23
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:37,900
It was not so bright.

24
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:45,962
Not much to see.

25
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:52,736
It was a terrible accident.

26
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I don't remember.

27
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,908
- How did it happen?
- A mistake, dear.

28
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,283
There is plenty of time to answer questions,

29
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:19,296
but now you need to rest.

30
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:21,212
Dear,
don't move out of bed.

31
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,034
You need to rest.

32
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:48,178
Well, what happened?

33
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:54,251
People disappear all the time.

34
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:58,392
If found dead,

35
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:01,936
Means another small town
complained about this city.

36
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,063
What else is there?

37
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,767
Men chaotic?

38
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,403
Okay, send it.

39
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,842
What are you writing?

40
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,881
I will tell what will be done.

41
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,584
I will enter your notes in my notebook.

42
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:57,107
It's time, sleepyhead!

43
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,485
I'm afraid I'll never
see your beautiful eyes again.

44
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,019
How long have I slept?

45
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:22,086
- Two days.
- Yikes.

46
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,317
The doctor said it's okay

47
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,467
for someone like your circumstances.

48
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,574
Doctor?

49
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,381
I hear voices...

50
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,615
I saw shadows
while sleeping.

51
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:45,655
Where is the doctor?

52
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,157
See? It's better.

53
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,339
Will prepare dinner.

54
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,390
Dear, don't need to get out of bed
.

55
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:02,825
.. My leg fracture ..

56
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:07,751
You drink painkillers.
Will not be so pronounced.

57
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,876
I feel confused.

58
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:18,348
Everything is new for me.

59
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,454
Like a cat...

60
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,490
I heard a cat.

61
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:31,227
I don't remember we have a cat.

62
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,801
Yes, but we have.

63
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:43,206
Because you've been down here,

64
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:48,433
Do you want to eat dinner together as
spouse, as before?

65
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
Yes.

66
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,461
Well, I cook your
favorite.

67
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
My favorite?

68
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,553
Sorry. Sometimes I forget
you can't remember.

69
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,864
Roasted beef.

70
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,866
you like roasted beef.

71
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:20,708
When did we moved here?

72
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:29,082
- Shortly before the incident.
- And you have to go through all this?

73
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,924
- You don't need to take care of me.
- don't have to, but I want...

74
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,631
You're my husband.

75
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,769
Now let's eat.

76
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:54,177
Come on, puss.

77
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,944
Elephant died due to blood clots ..

78
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:22,338
what ..?

79
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,941
In the forest...

80
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,821
Death is more due to

81
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:35,971
lack of food and water.

82
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:41,591
The pressure that kills them.

83
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:53,436
Do you remember?

84
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,165
- No.
- You don't remember about the elephant?

85
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:13,014
- No, I can't think.
- What do you remember?

86
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I can't remember where I grew up.

87
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,997
You can't remember our
dance party?

88
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,281
You kissed me in the river?

89
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
You don't remember?

90
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
I want...

91
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,897
I'm sorry....

92
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,513
Did you know that the first can opener

93
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:03,834
discovered 50 years before
cans are produced first time?

94
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,284
I miss you.

95
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,793
Are we...

96
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:26,129
happy?

97
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,067
You'll have to ask ..?

98
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,938
I think I've just
remind you about it.

99
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:48,618
Should I remind you again?

100
00:18:58,997 --> 00:19:00,997
How was the first time we met?

101
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:06,002
It was love at first sight.

102
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,875
Where did we go
honeymoon?

103
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,146
To the north.

104
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:22,418
north, where?

105
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:29,947
I wish the accident had no effect on memory.

106
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:43,024
How did it happen?

107
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:46,675
- Why did not you hurt?
- I was thrown from the car.

108
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:50,713
<i>But let's not talk about it
, baby</i>

109
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:53,282
it just makes you sad

110
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:58,818
<i>I want to be happy again</i>

111
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:03,522
There was a car accident on the road 83
the victim was not found

112
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:05,763
but had taken blood samples ,

113
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,913
- Did you check the number plate ??
- Yes sir.

114
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,333
The car was not registered since the 60s.
Light blue Thunderbird.

115
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,703
- How many casualties?
- Still don't know.

116
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:17,531
From the results of the examination on the car
2 adults and a daughter.

117
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,742
- How is the weather?
- Good.

118
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:21,892
- It's raining?
- No sir.

119
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:24,042
Good.

120
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,714
- Should...
- give me the address? Yes.

121
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,112
- Now?
- Yes.

122
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:30,219
Good. Thank you sir.

123
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,470
<i>Dad...</i>

124
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,842
<i>Dad...</i>

125
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:55,197
What are you doing, dear?

126
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,934
I'm looking for you.

127
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,039
No need to be like that.

128
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:10,947
Please, I'm very worried.

129
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,719
Especially after what happened.

130
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,090
You're right .., sorry.

131
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:28,242
Why don't you take off your clothes
upward?

132
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:30,857
I'll be here for a while and
prepare your bath.

133
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:37,671
No, no need.
I can do myself.

134
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:39,975
This is a wedding.

135
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,579
We help each other.

136
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:47,080
Okay, I'll wait
above.

137
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,054
Yes

138
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:04,424
This is part of my nightmares,
I can't get rid of it.

139
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,076
Repeated.

140
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:19,315
He ..

141
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:26,188
girl...

142
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:31,026
called me ..dad.

143
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:40,298
Have you noticed that the battery
sold its size "A" "C" and "D"?

144
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,041
Why there's no size B?

145
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:53,617
Battery "B" does not work well
among consumers,

146
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:55,918
so that customers leave.

147
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:00,768
Still can be found in Europe.

148
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:03,555
..used for bikes' light

149
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,801
Tell me about yourself.

150
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:18,002
I want to know more about you

151
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:24,713
Do you have other relatives?

152
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,318
What about me?

153
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,396
I want to know you.

154
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:43,299
The woman I love.

155
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:53,910
I hate talking about the past.

156
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,181
You know that.

157
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,348
I want to focus on our future

158
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,390
This is my movie room

159
00:28:57,328 --> 00:28:59,328
place where I made a movie

160
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,531
I don't remember.

161
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:06,802
I don't remember any of this.

162
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:14,075
I don't know what you got,
what I got.

163
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,044
Where I can go and not.

164
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:29,425
Sometimes I forget.

165
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:34,163
It's okay.

166
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,501
That's why I got this room.

167
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:43,205
Full of memories.

168
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:47,249
Help me to remember.

169
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:51,145
I know it's hard for you.

170
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:56,885
Will you help me to remember?

171
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,390
Yes...

172
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:12,599
- What's in that room?
- Only room.

173
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:15,237
Bedroom else?

174
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,740
It's just a room.

175
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,242
I thought I saw someone there.

176
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:22,203
How?

177
00:30:22,813 --> 00:30:24,847
Door.
I think there is a person.

178
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:40,448
Just curious.

179
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:42,859
You know what they say about curiosity
.

180
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:45,554
I'm just trying to remember.

181
00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:47,704
I know, dear. I know.

182
00:30:47,854 --> 00:30:50,527
I will stop at the store after work.

183
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,677
I need to examine my patients.

184
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:57,312
Do you agree?
- Yes.

185
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,202
Pregnancy Tests

186
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,081
Animal Hospital

187
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,072
What is it, dear?

188
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,350
I go to the basement.

189
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:20,554
I saw someone. I see what you're doing.
- I said don't ever come down.

190
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,581
I never made a secret with you my first husband

191
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:28,563
Who are you?

192
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
I am a woman who loves you,

193
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,471
who cares about you,

194
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:40,075
feed you,

195
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:42,844
bath you,

196
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,381
make love to you.

197
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:57,592
I'm your wife.

198
00:39:30,861 --> 00:39:32,861
You seem a little depressed

199
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:46,093
Honey, you know about electroshock therapy
,

200
00:39:47,277 --> 00:39:49,777
known as "shock therapy"?

201
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:53,216
Back to the 16th century in Eastern Europe,

202
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:57,053
but became popular in the 30's in America.

203
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:05,005
Although this therapy is controversial,

204
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:08,254
it still used in this country and around the world

205
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,633
as a cure for depression.

206
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:17,194
I think it would help you, honey.
I really believe.

207
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:20,075
No, no!

208
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,100
See? It was not so bad, right?

209
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,731
No, no!

210
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:21,469
Did you know that Conway Tweety
has 55 hits?

211
00:41:22,472 --> 00:41:24,472
Even more than Elvis Presley.

212
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,367
Do you realize how
importance is family?

213
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:07,649
Strong family is the backbone of the community
.

214
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:11,653
There is nothing more beautiful than

215
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:14,301
relationship between husband and wife,

216
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,882
raising children at home.

217
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:25,294
I just want to see in the future.
That's all.

218
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:30,764
Forget the past.
- My body...

219
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:35,043
sick.

220
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:37,875
Shock therapy has side effects.

221
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,683
Please stop.

222
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:46,147
Make it stop.

223
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:52,794
Do you love me?

224
00:42:55,832 --> 00:42:57,832
Do you love me?

225
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:02,237
Yes.

226
00:43:02,806 --> 00:43:04,806
I love you too.

227
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,711
Do you want to quit?

228
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,639
Yes

229
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:14,782
Then, I want something.

230
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:19,354
I want a baby.

231
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,817
Does not every woman wants from her husband?

232
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:26,794
A baby...

233
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:29,197
I want a child.

234
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:31,466
From my own family

235
00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:39,207
you want me to stop?

236
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:43,800
- Yes.
- Give me a family.

237
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,582
To get, you have to give

238
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:51,219
That's called a good marriage.

239
00:44:06,736 --> 00:44:08,792
Memories are something great,
isn't it?

240
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:31,524
I know you are curious ..
so you see my family album

241
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,935
I always know when you touch
my stuff because it is changing.

242
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:01,155
Why is there no photo of us?
Where is it all?

243
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,327
It was not your picture.

244
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,333
None of them is you.

245
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,390
Hi. How are you, Dave?

246
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:22,224
Always well, when I can see you.
- Oh sweetness...

247
00:47:22,866 --> 00:47:26,197
I got a registered letter. You must sign ..

248
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,902
.. Briefly Why not get in?

249
00:47:36,546 --> 00:47:39,879
I'm going to the kitchen, I'll be back.
- Good.

250
00:48:51,454 --> 00:48:54,232
You must maintain an attitude,
when we have guests.

251
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,834
This is better.

252
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,743
Everything is okay?
- I'm looking for a pen.

253
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,971
Thank you!
I will take it.

254
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:13,601
What are you doing?

255
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,470
You want to know more about me?

256
00:50:17,674 --> 00:50:19,674
Look at me when I talk to you

257
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:24,312
Do you want to know about my past?

258
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:33,322
Or do you want to know more about us
?

259
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:38,192
What?
- What happened on the night of the incident.

260
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:41,696
When would you like to tell me?

261
00:50:45,034 --> 00:50:48,060
Do you really not know?
- No.

262
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,720
How can I?

263
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:14,562
Dear...

264
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:18,661
something to euthanize my job... living

265
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:23,633
And they don't wake up,
Did you know that?

266
00:51:24,674 --> 00:51:26,674
I don't care at all!

267
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:29,877
This is what dreams about

268
00:51:43,826 --> 00:51:46,049
One day you would expect,
you care more about her.

269
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,200
Who is she?

270
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:58,439
I still see it ..

271
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,410
In my dreams...

272
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:08,482
is it my daughter?

273
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:13,087
Our daughter?

274
00:52:15,491 --> 00:52:18,287
Please tell me she's okay.

275
00:52:21,564 --> 00:52:23,564
I have a job.

276
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,513
Listen, I got a lot of work.
I would stay in office.

277
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:55,028
Bring patrol car passes Bird Street,

278
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:59,065
.. Magpay with Mokingbard

279
00:52:59,268 --> 00:53:01,268
check.

280
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:04,223
what do you think?

281
00:53:04,373 --> 00:53:06,762
I think he had a heart attack and died
..

282
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,676
in the bushes with a pile of letters has not been sent.

283
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:12,379
Okay, keep me posted.

284
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:32,126
Help!

285
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:44,837
Help! Help me!

286
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,914
Help!

287
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,270
<i>Help</i>

288
00:55:16,372 --> 00:55:18,372
Help me!

289
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:28,616
I'm here!

290
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,577
Help! I am here!

291
00:55:36,692 --> 00:55:38,692
Help!

292
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:47,501
No!

293
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:04,075
He should not interfere in our family
.

294
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,423
You know, bottle caps

295
00:56:10,259 --> 00:56:13,886
more expensive to produce than the bottle itself?

296
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:25,105
I got up from my chair,
I hope this is something important.

297
00:56:27,943 --> 00:56:31,237
I don't know, maybe he just ran off with
letters

298
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:35,774
Did you call the office?
did you go to his house?

299
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,019
No?

300
00:56:39,288 --> 00:56:43,051
actually..he sleeps at his house with his children.

301
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:46,888
Or with others,
he was not on duty.

302
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:54,893
Okay, I'll stop by to some
house while I'm gone.

303
00:56:55,638 --> 00:56:58,250
But if I disappear
must know something.

304
00:56:59,475 --> 00:57:01,475
I'm going to die.

305
00:57:39,482 --> 00:57:41,482
Want to know more about you.

306
00:57:47,323 --> 00:57:49,323
I hope you're ready.

307
00:57:52,962 --> 00:57:54,962
It's okay.

308
00:57:55,798 --> 00:57:57,798
don't cry.

309
00:58:02,238 --> 00:58:04,238
Gosh.

310
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:07,051
You can't even remember
your daughter, Audrey?

311
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,646
don't say, at least
you remember.

312
00:58:25,828 --> 00:58:30,293
sHe became naughty girl.
I have to lock him in the kennels.

313
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:36,495
Please, don't hurt her,
You can't do that.

314
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,732
Depends on you.
- Let her go.

315
00:58:41,877 --> 00:58:43,877
I will,

316
00:58:45,448 --> 00:58:47,607
Once you agree
make me pregnant.

317
00:58:49,685 --> 00:58:51,685
I need another child.

318
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:58,392
Audrey overgrow.

319
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:06,564
Everything will be fine, right?

320
00:59:13,142 --> 00:59:15,142
Whatever you want.

321
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,345
But please let her go

322
00:59:20,816 --> 00:59:22,816
This is a good start.

323
00:59:28,324 --> 00:59:30,324
You're going to be good, right?

324
00:59:33,162 --> 00:59:35,162
Nice

325
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:11,565
Come on.

326
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,020
don't you pretty?

327
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,360
don't ruin your makeup.

328
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:57,264
Dear,  I got a surprise for you.

329
01:01:01,317 --> 01:01:03,749
don't you have the perfect family?

330
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:14,494
Come on, honey.

331
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:17,639
I think it's time to tell father

332
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:19,956
what happened in the night of the incident.

333
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:41,421
Help me, please!

334
01:02:04,813 --> 01:02:07,905
<i>If you want to call,
close the phone and try again</i>

335
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:38,912
I'm thirsty

336
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,468
Family forever.

337
01:04:17,913 --> 01:04:19,913
No matter what...

338
01:04:24,953 --> 01:04:26,953
During your life ..

339
01:04:30,225 --> 01:04:35,388
claim the happy moments...
others as if yours...

340
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:48,542
your life...

341
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,480
memories .. ..

342
01:04:59,288 --> 01:05:01,288
What do you want...

343
01:05:11,934 --> 01:05:17,140
Did you know that Walter Freeman
creating a lobotomy?

344
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:22,375
Freeman took a knife and stabbed
just above the tear ducts

345
01:05:23,979 --> 01:05:25,979
and moved into the vicinity.

346
01:05:33,956 --> 01:05:37,753
From 1936-1950...

347
01:05:40,262 --> 01:05:46,734
Scientists roam the countryside with a car called lobotomobil.

348
01:05:48,337 --> 01:05:51,449
In order to demonstrate the procedure of treatment

349
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:59,137
This is a major advance in the science of surgery.

350
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,584
Believed to be the cure for all mental illness ..

351
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:07,218
including delinquency in children.

352
01:06:17,232 --> 01:06:19,493
I've never done before
lobotomy.

353
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:24,032
And I would never do
for the first time in Audrey.

354
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:31,745
I know that is a bit extreme

355
01:06:35,183 --> 01:06:37,183
I don't intend to do that,

356
01:06:39,154 --> 01:06:42,619
but I think if I did not do,
you will never be happy here...

357
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:54,048
At least, accept, naturally do
the first time with you, not at Audrey.

358
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:21,393
I want to know who is calling
here at night like this?

359
01:07:54,795 --> 01:07:56,795
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

360
01:07:56,945 --> 01:07:59,503
I'm here for
missing person investigation.

361
01:07:59,653 --> 01:08:02,289
I'm sorry to hear that,
but I don't see anyone.

362
01:08:02,804 --> 01:08:06,072
I was in the shower can excuse? Thank you.

363
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:05,365
You make the floor flooded.

364
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,501
You ruined my floor!

365
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,815
<i>Dad...</i>

366
01:10:55,977 --> 01:10:58,170
Calm. You're safe now.

367
01:11:00,015 --> 01:11:02,015
How is my child,

394
01:14:13,341 --> 01:14:15,341
My daughter...

395
01:14:15,977 --> 01:14:17,977
Why do you think she was your daughter?

405
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:04,151
All I know is,
I have a daughter named Audrey.

406
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:22,909
she's not your daughter.

407
01:15:23,945 --> 01:15:27,481
Audrey Williams is the daughter

01:15:27,782 --> 01:15:29,782
The man who is very rich.

409
01:15:31,953 --> 01:15:33,953
When she disappeared,

410
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:37,056
<i>emerging demand ransom by mail</i>

411
01:15:52,974 --> 01:15:54,974
You can do this.

412
01:15:55,844 --> 01:15:58,504
We need money for medicine.

413
01:16:00,115 --> 01:16:02,274
If you want a child, let's do
.

414
01:16:06,488 --> 01:16:08,488
If I want to have child?

handwriting samples from your home.

419
01:16:41,803 --> 01:16:44,929
No, no...

420
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:48,861
We know you took her.

421
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:52,131
Audrey admitted.

422
01:16:58,559 --> 01:17:00,559
Hello, dear.

423
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:04,070
We've just here, and we got lost.
Can you mind helping us?

424
01:17:04,379 --> 01:17:06,379
Thank you.

425
01:17:12,873 --> 01:17:14,873
You face difficult moments...

426
01:17:15,023 --> 01:17:18,854
Moreover
three murder victims who was found in the basement

427
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:22,061
This is life.

428
01:17:24,532 --> 01:17:26,532
I've never killed anyone.

429
01:17:28,503 --> 01:17:32,226
You don't remember your name
how do you know you did not kill them?

430
01:17:34,809 --> 01:17:36,809
He did.

431
01:17:38,847 --> 01:17:40,847
He has not been found.

432
01:17:42,317 --> 01:17:45,716
It puts you in the right
place at the wrong time

433
01:17:46,221 --> 01:17:48,414
Or the wrong place at the right time

434
01:17:49,924 --> 01:17:53,755
Or the wrong place and the wrong time.

435
01:17:57,499 --> 01:17:59,499
There are both wrong.

436
01:18:00,268 --> 01:18:02,268
True?

437
01:18:05,073 --> 01:18:07,073
I did not do it.

438
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:17,376
People do many things now, have child.

439
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,490
I don't want to do that.

440
01:18:25,827 --> 01:18:28,291
Bad idea I'm going to return ..

441
01:18:28,696 --> 01:18:30,696
This is a gift for us.

442
01:18:44,412 --> 01:18:46,524
You want to help you remember?

443
01:18:48,483 --> 01:18:50,517
There are many choices...

444
01:18:51,219 --> 01:18:54,982
expensive way for couples to have a family.

445
01:18:56,257 --> 01:18:59,813
All fertile drugs  is here

446
01:18:59,963 --> 01:19:02,930
Along with the accumulated bills.

447
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:08,998
This is a desperate move.

448
01:19:10,972 --> 01:19:13,870
He wanted to have child at all costs.

449
01:19:14,809 --> 01:19:18,003
And you've been planning the abduction,
to give it to her.

450
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:32,886
So this is my memory?

451
01:19:35,029 --> 01:19:37,029
Yes.

452
01:19:54,782 --> 01:19:58,318
Dad... I want my dad.

453
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:06,259
I want my dad.

454
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,027
Doctors say keep your mind as calm as possible

455
01:20:13,001 --> 01:20:15,113
This means subtract the bright light.

456
01:20:15,403 --> 01:20:17,403
Not much to see.

457
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:30,902
Dear...

458
01:20:31,052 --> 01:20:33,252
I put things to bed life

459
01:20:34,422 --> 01:20:38,316
..and they don't wake up,
you know that?
