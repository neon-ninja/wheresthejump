2
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,032
Miller, this situation
is out of control and dangerous.

3
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:09,800
Johnson, I'm calling it in.

4
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:12,971
Headquarters is ready to send
military backup on my word.

5
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:15,040
Stay focused.

6
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,708
She is the key
to the source.

7
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,111
She's always been the key.

8
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,649
Yeah, well,
I don't think she's here alone.

9
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:49,975
Agent Johnson file 69232B.

10
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:52,109
Constant 24-7 surveillance

11
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:56,650
so far has garnered nothing
but mundane daily life.

12
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:06,991
We continue
to monitor the subject

13
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,860
with no extraordinary
results so far.

14
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:11,395
At current,

15
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:16,400
the subject is completely
unaware of our probe.

16
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:19,169
She continues
to live her current identity

17
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:22,676
with apparently no recollection
of what has happened to her.

18
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,677
We remain vigilant

19
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:28,046
gathering and documenting
all information

20
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:31,252
and will keep the Bureau
aware of all developments.

21
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:40,058
Dr. Luiza Moreira?

22
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
- Dr. Luiza Moreira.
- Moreira.

23
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,794
You must be Dr. Jones.

24
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:46,133
Yes, but you can call me Vincent.
Please sit.

25
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm part of a team of experts

26
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:51,703
in various disciplines.

27
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:55,673
Your background in psychology
and cultural anthropology

28
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:59,411
plus your work in South Africa
is exceptional.

29
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,413
We all came together
to help solve a case

30
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:04,014
or outbreak or...

31
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,851
I don't know what it is.

32
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:09,086
I've decided
to keep a video record

33
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,989
of all facts and findings.

34
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,991
It's been very crazy lately.

35
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:15,859
We just received
another victim.

36
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:19,230
So are they victims
or infected?

37
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,265
How much have you
been briefed on?

38
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:22,134
Not much.

39
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,437
Authorities up and down
the East Coast

40
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,005
thought they were dealing

41
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,108
with some sort of
serial killer, I guess.

42
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,110
Well, bodies
have been showing up

43
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,844
along the eastern seaboard.

44
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:36,113
Maybe beyond.

45
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:39,718
Police were discovering bodies.

46
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,986
Skulls smashed,

47
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:45,123
parts of the brains missing.

48
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,026
But the timelines
didn't match up.

49
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:51,262
The victims... six at first...
all died

50
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:55,500
within roughly
the same time period,

51
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:58,103
across several states.

52
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,204
Law enforcement officials

53
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:03,108
shared information
and determined...

54
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,009
- Sheriff Williams?
- Yep.

55
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:07,010
- What're these guys doing here?
- Oh, it's okay,

56
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:08,880
it's the press.
I called them.

57
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,781
Look, I am gonna warn you now.

58
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,117
It's not a pretty site.

59
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,384
We've been sharing information

60
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:16,120
with other
law enforcement officials.

61
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:17,387
What has been determined

62
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,257
that a single killer
cannot do all this.

63
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,825
He can't be in several places
at the same time.

64
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,127
It's impossible.
I'm tired of the Feds

65
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,497
saying there's a serial killer
out there.

66
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,132
There's no serial killer.
It's not one person doing this.

67
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:29,534
You see what's on
tis landscape here?

68
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:32,036
Earlier today I found
two women at a camp site.

69
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,404
First they're alive
and just like that,

70
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:36,307
they both dropped dead
right in front of me.

71
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:38,343
There's some crazy shit
going on here,

72
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,245
and the public
needs to be aware.

73
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:41,980
You gotta know
what's going on.

74
00:05:41,982 --> 00:05:44,882
Open your eyes be aware.

75
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:48,952
Investigators
thought maybe it was a cult.

76
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:50,387
Like Manson.

77
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,024
It's a bunch of Satanists
all along the shore.

78
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:54,558
Some kind of crazy cult.

79
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,327
Just chopping people's bodies up
and eating like their brains

80
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,298
like some type
of devil worship!

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,565
It's sick!

82
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:06,503
The skulls
weren't smashed in.

83
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:09,240
They had burst outward.

84
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,242
I'm presenting you something...

85
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:14,411
I was contacted
to join this team.

86
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,913
I and the others

87
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,515
are trying to explain
the phenomenon

88
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:21,920
from every possible angle.

89
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,055
I was told that the body
that arrived today

90
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:25,589
was of a college student.

91
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,425
Yeah, uh, the police
gave me,

92
00:06:28,427 --> 00:06:32,363
uh, some videos and materials
for you to look at.

93
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,832
What's that?

94
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,966
All of this facility
is recorded

95
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,502
including this office.

96
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,070
Are we being monitored?

97
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:42,574
Think of it as like
a black box on a plane.

98
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,909
Unless the plane goes down,

99
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:47,911
then the box is retrieved.

100
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:50,048
Is that legal?

101
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,050
You're working
for the US Government now.

102
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:53,517
I have a lot to do.

103
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,952
I'll see you later,

104
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,988
and maybe
we can have lunch.

105
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,259
Yes, of course.

106
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,997
Okay, bye.

107
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,332
The victims
share nothing in common

108
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:11,301
that could help us
pinpoint the motive

109
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:14,505
or cause of death.

110
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,341
Then we got these videos

111
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:18,543
from police in Montauk.

112
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:20,277
Homelessness...

113
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,613
- You ready?
- Huh... oh, yeah, yeah, dude.

114
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:25,250
- Uh, just go ahead and roll.
- Okay.

115
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:27,517
Three... two...

116
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,086
Homelessness.

117
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,389
Often considered to be
a symptom of urban blight.

118
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:33,625
But here in the tranquil beaches
of Montauk, New York,

119
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,127
away from the cities,
away from the attractions,

120
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,128
we find societies
unfortunate citizens

121
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,397
finding themselves
to be outcasts and alone.

122
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,666
while their surroundings
may in fact be nicer,

123
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:44,337
their plight
is not any easier.

124
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:50,140
My colleagues
don't see any relevance,

125
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:53,110
but I...

126
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:55,980
Maybe it's nothing.

127
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:57,981
But it's interesting.

128
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,385
Hello, excuse me, sir.
Oh, oh, uh, sorry.

129
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:02,519
Look, it's okay.
We're shooting a documentary.

130
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,123
All right, we just want
to ask you a couple questions.

131
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,894
Would that be...
would that be okay?

132
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:10,428
Um, uh, look.

133
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,331
We're, we're terribly
sorry to bother you.

134
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,132
We just wanna ask you
a couple questions.

135
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:17,101
You know, we're just
interested in how you got here.

136
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,635
How you got
in this predicament.

137
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:20,538
They put me here.

138
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,176
Who put you here?

139
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,610
They took mommy.

140
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,245
She was good at numbers,

141
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:31,248
and they left
what was left of daddy.

142
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,451
They left me
on the boat for ten years.

143
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:37,055
But they took and they gave.

144
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,488
They gave mommy back,
but not to me.

145
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,391
They gave me a gift.

146
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:42,660
They gave me a job.

147
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,899
But they said I wasn't worthy.

148
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,232
They said
it was for someone special.

149
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,700
My analysis,

150
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:53,603
plus any evidence
that comes my way.

151
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:56,273
In this case,

152
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,642
the first video

153
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:01,345
is the beginning
of a student film.

154
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:03,982
This project was your idea.
I swear, if this film

155
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,483
fucks up my class grade,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

156
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,118
Oh, you're gonna
fucking kick my ass, dude?

157
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,520
Just man up and talk to him.

158
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:10,655
Dude, big talk for the guy that's
safe behind the fucking camera.

159
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:12,456
You know what? Why don't you
try coming on this side

160
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,459
talking to the fucking
crazy person for once, huh?

161
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,594
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.

162
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:19,229
- Are you being fucking serious?
- Yeah, stop busting my balls

163
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,998
and hand over the camera.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,233
Or are you all talk,
you fucking chickenshit?

165
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:27,738
Could it be
a really clever killer

166
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,775
who did something
to the bodies

167
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:34,012
to make them seem
less like homicide?

168
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:37,647
They tell me what to write,

169
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,517
and then they tell me to wait.

170
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,520
Good.

171
00:09:42,522 --> 00:09:45,422
The teachings are for him.

172
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:47,026
The gift...

173
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:53,664
the gift is for you.

174
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,233
For me?

175
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:57,768
Sir, where are you talking...?

176
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,373
It was always yours.

177
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,378
Oh my God. Ben, stop
fucking with this guy, man.

178
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,748
I wanna go home.

179
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,617
Dude, I wanna
get this over with.

180
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,618
We're already past deadline.

181
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,222
They're in my head.

182
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,660
Dude, come over here.

183
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,796
Check this out. I think there's
actually something in here.

184
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,664
Like some kind
of funky snake.

185
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:30,634
Some kind
of natural build up

186
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,369
within the victims,

187
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,372
brought on by something,

188
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:38,776
a poison, a disease,

189
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:40,313
a parasite.

190
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:43,283
Oh! Ahh!

191
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,383
I am their prophet

192
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,187
and you're that messenger.

193
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:54,691
For the student
found on the beach,

194
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,160
the cause of death

195
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:58,798
matches the other
cases along the coast.

196
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,633
As for the homeless man...

197
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:06,237
The homeless man
is still missing,

198
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:10,241
but his book
came to us with the videos.

199
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:13,781
My colleagues
have no interest in it.

200
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,188
You think this is funny?

201
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,157
You think this is funny?

202
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,593
There's two people
in that video.

203
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:29,727
Now one's dead.

204
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:31,195
Worse than dead,

205
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,829
one we can't find,
and there's you.

206
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:35,101
Okay, fine.
I'll turn this off.

207
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,371
Now you got to see
how this looks.

208
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:41,906
You and your friend
disappear for a week.

209
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:45,142
Now we find him dead
on the beach...

210
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:46,544
that's how we found him...

211
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:49,579
and then we find you
wondering around the streets.

212
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:50,781
You see?

213
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,318
It doesn't look good.

214
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:56,921
Don't you think?

215
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,623
- How's it going?
- What do you think?

216
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,224
Good.

217
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,426
I need some help here.
You gonna help me here?

218
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,863
Lucas, are you gonna
help me here, okay?

219
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:08,199
We found these books
with the body.

220
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,734
They were stolen from
the New York public library.

221
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:12,271
Any idea why?

222
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:21,212
Big books on, um, history,

223
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:24,482
um, space travel and physics,
but we checked

224
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:27,384
and he doesn't study
any of those subjects.

225
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:29,786
He's focused on film class
just like you are.

226
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,357
So why would he steal 'em?

227
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,358
Answer him kid.

228
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,594
Was he on drugs maybe?
He was on drugs maybe

229
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:41,398
and he was trying to sell these books
and make some quick cash, maybe?

230
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,401
Fast cash?
Yes, no?

231
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:45,335
Okay, Lucas,

232
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:47,305
we found the video.

233
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:50,608
Okay, we saw the video...
found it and we saw it...

234
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,910
we do not think
that you had anything

235
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:54,911
to do directly
with your friend's murder,

236
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:57,915
but you need to help me here,
you need to help me here,

237
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,550
or I am gonna jam
your fuckin' ass up,

238
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:00,951
I'm gonna
put you in prison,

239
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:03,253
and you are not gonna
do well in prison, Lucas.

240
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:04,689
You're gonna be
a piece of chicken in there.

241
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:05,956
They're gonna
pass you around

242
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,592
like a motherfuckin'
tissue paper

243
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,594
and blow their noses
in you.

244
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,264
Is the homeless guy dead, too?

245
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,932
Did he attack you and then you
killed him in self-defense

246
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,701
and then panicked
and left the body somewhere?

247
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,369
Speak up, kid.

248
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:22,239
You can't tell me who the
other guy in the video is?

249
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,574
You can't?

250
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:27,612
Okay, listen, what the fuck is this thing?
What's this thing?

251
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:29,546
'Cause you were holding on it
for dear fuckin' life

252
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:30,815
when we jammed your ass up.

253
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,717
As far as we can tell,
it's the same one

254
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,986
he has in the video.

255
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,521
So how did it come to be
in your possession?

256
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:39,456
That's hard to explain.

257
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,892
That's gonna be a fuckin' jury's ass
up, man, and put you in prison.

258
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,694
- The book was...
- Take a breathe, all right?

259
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:45,262
Relax.
Nobody's here to hurt you.

260
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:47,765
You wanna take a break, okay?
Take a break?

261
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:49,367
- Take a break.
- Take a drink, all right?

262
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,901
- Oh, what the fuck.
- You're bullshittin' me, right?

263
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:53,874
- Oh, what the...
- What the... shit!

264
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:56,906
No, no, no, it's okay.

265
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:58,475
Lucas, it's okay.
It's okay, man.

266
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,611
Hey, hey, relax.

267
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:02,613
Relax.
Okay, come on.

268
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:04,448
You don't wanna do this?

269
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,450
You wanna do this?
You wanna kill me?

270
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:09,719
Why you do wanna kill me?

271
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:11,988
I've been nice to you.

272
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,891
You're safe here.
Lucas, you're safe here, okay?

273
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:15,493
We can just forget
you even did this.

274
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:17,762
Just give me the gun back.
Just give me the gun.

275
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:19,363
Come on, just give it me.
Just put it down.

276
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:20,864
Put it on the table
and we'll forget about it.

277
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,699
- There are voices in my head.
- Lucas, look, Lucas.

278
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,768
- There are voices in my head!
- What? You hear voices?

279
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,704
Okay, we'll find you a doctor,
we'll get rid of the voices.

280
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:28,575
There are voices in my head!

281
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:32,910
I've done some research
about the beach at Montauk,

282
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,612
the same area
where the police

283
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:37,714
discovered the student's body.

284
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:40,050
The homeless man
talked about

285
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:43,587
losing his parents
a decade ago.

286
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,690
Back then,
the Coast Guard

287
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,892
came across a small yacht

288
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:51,664
drifting offshore
near that beach.

289
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,469
Hey, Tommy,
come here, buddy.

290
00:14:58,471 --> 00:14:59,737
Let me show you
how to do this.

291
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:01,705
Be care,
that's sharp.

292
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:04,041
Okay, all right.

293
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:06,444
All right, let's,
all right.

294
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:07,781
Got it?

295
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:11,916
Jesus.
Come here.

296
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:15,051
Be careful, I said.
You're gonna poke your eye out.

297
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:17,821
So you wanna put your thumb on
this so you don't lose the line.

298
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:20,123
All right,
you push this back

299
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,859
and let it go
out into the water.

300
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:24,929
- What happens if you don't...
- So go a head.

301
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:27,797
put, um,
put your finger there?

302
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,934
Well, it'll go out
faster than you want it to

303
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:31,835
- and maybe...
- Use all of it.

304
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:34,537
Yeah, use all of it
and tangle up...

305
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,540
According to the report,

306
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,809
the boy claimed

307
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:41,712
his father was killed

308
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:45,782
and his mother abducted,

309
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:48,651
but he was in
a state of shock

310
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:51,921
and couldn't
provide any details.

311
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,523
There you go.
Now hold on tight.

312
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:55,925
Here we let it...
you gotta...

313
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,895
you gotta tease 'em with it
a little bit.

314
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,765
You know,
you have to feel it.

315
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,033
You see,
the best part of fishing's

316
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:06,103
just being out here
and feeling the wind

317
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,004
in your hair...

318
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:10,174
feeling the boat move
on the water.

319
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,642
Look at the view here.

320
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:13,980
- Isn't that cool?
- Yeah.

321
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:24,954
Dad?

322
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,727
- What is it, buddy?
- Look at that.

323
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:31,762
There's nothing.

324
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:33,897
No follow-up reports.

325
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,900
No names are given.

326
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:39,639
I hit a dead end.

327
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,719
There's a brief mention

328
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:00,123
that the mother
was a renowned scientist.

329
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:04,628
There's some speculation
that perhaps

330
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,664
she was kidnapped.

331
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,601
No cause of death
for the father is given.

332
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,068
There's a note

333
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,038
that the boy
was hospitalized.

334
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,842
Either people
aren't talking

335
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:21,010
or the right files
didn't survive.

336
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:24,849
The family's identity
is a mystery.

337
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:28,751
I can't prove this,

338
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:32,890
but what if the homeless man

339
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:36,794
was the boy
on the yacht, grown up?

340
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:38,562
The Coast Guard report

341
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:43,633
does match elements
of the homeless man's story.

342
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:47,071
Could he have slipped through
the cracks over the years,

343
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:50,908
bouncing from
hospital to hospital,

344
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,010
until all recorded proof

345
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:57,882
of his existence disappeared?

346
00:17:57,884 --> 00:18:01,684
If the boy grew up

347
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,821
to be the homeless man,

348
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:07,624
maybe his parents
were the first victims

349
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,796
of whatever it is.

350
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,796
Could the thing in the jug

351
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,632
have something
to do with all this?

352
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,168
She's here now.
She already started.

353
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,636
We know what to do.

354
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,905
Make sure she completes
her task.

355
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:24,842
We'll make sure that nothing
interferes with this mission.

356
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:26,680
Everything's depending on it.

357
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:29,216
Thank you.

358
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,934
So how did your meeting
with Jones go?

359
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:52,835
You know, he's a suit.

360
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:54,270
He may be watching this,

361
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:55,738
you know?

362
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,076
He's a great guy.

363
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:02,313
You have no idea
who's watching this.

364
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,950
No idea.

365
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:09,753
Let me tell you something,
Johnson.

366
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:13,123
I have seen my share
of crazy in my time,

367
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,994
classified shit that would
make your hair turn white.

368
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:20,064
If the people out there
saw what we saw,

369
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,164
know what we know,

370
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,101
there would be
panic in the streets.

371
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:27,237
It's what they don't know
that has kept 'em safe.

372
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:30,173
Think about that.

373
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,875
But this,

374
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,244
this is something else.

375
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:36,212
This...

376
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:38,015
this is the big one.

377
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:42,018
And once Uncle Sam
gets his handle on it,

378
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,055
germ warfare,
special weapons...

379
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:49,895
they'll never
fuck with us again, ever.

380
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,228
And you and me, Johnson,

381
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,399
we were there
from the beginning...

382
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:57,737
the day that everything changed.

383
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,692
We are continuously
monitoring the subject.

384
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:24,827
It is my opinion
that she seems to have a sense

385
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,095
of being watched,

386
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,766
and has developed
some sort of paranoia

387
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,202
of her surroundings.

388
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:34,203
She seems overwhelmed

389
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:37,843
showing signs of fatigue
and physical deterioration.

390
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,946
I am unable to deduce
that this could be the reason

391
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:46,216
Dr. Luiza has been suffering
numerous headaches,

392
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:50,023
which appears to be escalating
as time passes.

393
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,761
These headaches have become
noticeably more severe.

394
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:04,034
The others
here at the facility,

395
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:06,202
they are baffled

396
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:07,770
and scared.

397
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:12,476
This epidemic
is reaching everyone

398
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:17,381
and no one
has a clue, yet.

399
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:20,249
They are dismissing
my theories.

400
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:22,419
So what you're suggesting
is that we're dealing

401
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:25,389
with some giant
prehistoric parasite?

402
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:26,890
Just look at the video

403
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:29,759
with the film student.

404
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:32,863
You can see some kind
of large worm

405
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:34,965
leap out of the jug.

406
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,133
After that,
he ended up at the beach,

407
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,901
dead, like the others,

408
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:42,171
like something had forced
its way out of his head.

409
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:44,040
I don't know what you think
you're seeing in these videos,

410
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,309
'cause there is nothing
conclusive showing any worm

411
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:47,911
or anything attacking anyone.

412
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:49,912
There's a black blur.

413
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:52,349
- That's it.
- Don't you get it?

414
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:54,785
These worm-like organisms

415
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:56,754
force their hosts
toward water.

416
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,255
And that's happening

417
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:00,023
with the victims
in these cases.

418
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:01,792
They are moving toward water.

419
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:03,160
If I wanna talk to someone
about parasites,

420
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:06,196
I have an entire group
dedicated to that field.

421
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:07,930
But you?

422
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:09,767
You're supposed to be
working on the brain.

423
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:11,934
Here's a thought.

424
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,371
Whatever is happening
to these people

425
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,239
is causing brain damage.

426
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,409
So they started doing unexplainable,
irrational things. Simple.

427
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:22,546
So you need to stop looking
for some bigger conspiracy.

428
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:27,316
The homeless man,
crazy or not,

429
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,919
may have managed

430
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:31,157
to bury facts in here.

431
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,093
It could shed some light

432
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:39,228
on why the student
took the book

433
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,768
then killed himself.

434
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:46,903
I'll start reading it tonight.

435
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:49,405
It couldn't hurt.

436
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:52,176
High command wants
to document our every movement,

437
00:22:52,178 --> 00:22:54,914
so keep glasses on record
at all times.

438
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:59,449
Copy that.

439
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:01,921
The subject is leaving
her workplace.

440
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:12,766
Hey.

441
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:18,904
Hey!

442
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:31,116
Do you believe in
a Higher Power?

443
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:34,617
What're you talking about, man?

444
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,886
Higher Power, man,
Greater Good.

445
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:40,157
Something bigger than us.

446
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,494
What're you high?

447
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:44,995
'Cause I could use
a pick me up.

448
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:46,166
Whatcha got?

449
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:51,034
- I'm talking about life.
- Life?

450
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:55,171
Life.
Life with a purpose.

451
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:56,974
I have a purpose.

452
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:59,913
Oh yeah,
does it pay money?

453
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:04,483
The rewards are endless.

454
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:11,455
Bigger than money.

455
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:13,159
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

456
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,131
When I was ten,

457
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,033
I thought
my life was over, man,

458
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:26,303
'cause they,
they took my mom

459
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,173
for a grand mission.

460
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,975
But now I realize it was,
it was an honor, man.

461
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,982
I was chosen to usher in
the dawn a new world order.

462
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:43,420
Look man, I talk to crazy
dudes all the time,

463
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:45,488
but you're sick, man.

464
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,924
I know of a free clinic
you can go to.

465
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:50,163
What if I told you I can
give you anything you want?

466
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:55,134
A better life.

467
00:24:56,602 --> 00:24:59,937
A better everything.

468
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:02,639
- I'm listening.
- Yeah?

469
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:04,274
What if I told you
all you have to do

470
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:06,512
is look in the water.

471
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,551
Just in there.

472
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:24,163
Closer.

473
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:32,035
You see it?

474
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:33,139
Whoa.

475
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:37,911
I do see something.

476
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:43,313
But what is it?

477
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:45,084
Everything.

478
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:49,553
Kinda...

479
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:51,188
Touch it.

480
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,026
Kinda freaky.

481
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:19,149
I feel.

482
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:20,586
I serve.

483
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:24,123
I shall obey.

484
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,393
Thank you so much
for volunteering

485
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:32,796
for our new world order.

486
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,165
Your time will be
beneficial to you

487
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:39,135
and to us.

488
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:40,706
But mostly to us.

489
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:47,276
I did good, didn't I?

490
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,546
You're on your way?

491
00:26:49,548 --> 00:26:51,183
I'll protect you.

492
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:57,621
I've been examining this book,

493
00:26:57,623 --> 00:27:00,690
well, if you can
call it a book.

494
00:27:00,692 --> 00:27:03,526
It completely lacks

495
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:06,496
a coherent narrative.

496
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,498
It makes no sense.

497
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,669
It's just disjointed writing

498
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:15,705
and crude drawings.

499
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:19,476
Yet I've spent days,

500
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:22,379
weeks, going through it.

501
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:25,082
And there's something there,

502
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:26,349
something I can't

503
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:29,186
quite put my finger on.

504
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:33,556
It's like,
if you weren't careful enough,

505
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:38,094
just as you were
about to see something,

506
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:39,830
you'd lose it.

507
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,565
It would be gone

508
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:44,234
and you'd have to start

509
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:47,136
all over again.

510
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:50,306
And that's where
I feel like I am now

511
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:52,209
squinting at the pages,

512
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:55,211
on the cusp of something.

513
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:57,881
Then it's gone.

514
00:27:57,883 --> 00:28:00,784
But there
are some things in here

515
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:04,821
that seem to tie to it all.

516
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:06,323
The all of it.

517
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:09,558
As I examine the pages,

518
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,730
I get this sense of déjà vu.

519
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:17,767
And when I look
at that image,

520
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:21,438
it makes me think
of that thing

521
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,142
in the jug.

522
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,187
Okay, Dr. Jones,
ready when you are.

523
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:39,288
Yes, I'm Dr. Vincent Jones.

524
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,424
It's 10:35 a.m. March 7th,

525
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:45,497
and I'm here in Autopsy room 3B.

526
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:49,565
Who are these girls?

527
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,235
Jane Doe's
according to the file.

528
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:55,238
The poor chicks were fine
24 hours ago.

529
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,340
They were camping together
by the lake.

530
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:58,607
Who found the bodies?

531
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,610
The local sheriff.

532
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:03,646
- And where is the sheriff now?
- Not sure.

533
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:06,516
He disappeared after
the delivery of the bodies.

534
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:10,286
So what else do you know
what caused this?

535
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:11,691
Here is the report.

536
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:17,960
You got anything else?

537
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,697
We took some CT scans
when they were delivered.

538
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:22,668
The scans are over there.

539
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:29,842
There's something
in her forehead.

540
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,350
- Dr. Jones?
- What?

541
00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:41,918
- Dr. Jones!
- Help me!

542
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,490
Get the fuck outta here!

543
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,932
Fuck this!

544
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,245
Somebody open the door!

545
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:09,815
Open the fucking door!

546
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:13,816
Do we need to contain
this situation?

547
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:15,619
Yes,

548
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:19,756
we cannot have this affect or
interfere with our primary target.

549
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:21,894
Affirmative.
I am on it.

550
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:39,544
Hey!

551
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,452
Another video came in.

552
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:51,823
I made sure I got it.

553
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:59,431
My colleagues
haven't seen it.

554
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:02,535
They have the bodies...

555
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:08,975
but I don't know
if they are ready for this.

556
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,311
I'm not sure

557
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:16,215
any of us are ready.

558
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,851
You're shooting my ass,
aren't you?

559
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:24,688
Huh? Oh, may be.

560
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,489
- You are such an idiot.
- What? Are you speaking?

561
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:30,759
I can't really focus
on you right now.

562
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:34,930
I said that you are going to be
sleeping alone tonight.

563
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:36,099
Oh, okay, cool.

564
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:39,469
Keep that up, and I won't
let you do the woman job

565
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:40,937
of cleaning all the fish.

566
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:43,840
Hey, we're almost down
by the secret spot there.

567
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:46,709
Um, I hate to burst your bubble,
Mr. Manly,

568
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:49,446
but your secret spot
isn't so secret.

569
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:51,547
What?
Let me see.

570
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:54,450
My colleagues are focusing

571
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:55,985
on the bodies,

572
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:59,855
but not the circumstances
surrounding their condition

573
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:01,958
and discovery.

574
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,094
I begged them
to look at the book,

575
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:08,565
at the videos,

576
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,401
and they dismiss me.

577
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:12,969
But that hasn't stopped me.

578
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:16,439
Well, what do we have here?
Finders keepers, I guess, huh?

579
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:18,708
Hey, maybe we should go
somewhere else?

580
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,611
I mean, if that guy comes back and
sees us messing with his stuff

581
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:23,680
- he might get pissed, you know?
- He's not coming back.

582
00:32:23,682 --> 00:32:25,949
Look. He left his stuff
which is a bit weird

583
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:27,917
because this rod
is very expensive.

584
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,687
Hey, Ansel Adams, why don't you
come here for a close shot, huh?

585
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:32,087
Look at this shit.

586
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:34,657
Maybe he's off in the reeds
going to the bathroom.

587
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:36,726
- Can we please leave?
- Off in the reeds, babe?

588
00:32:36,728 --> 00:32:39,696
Come on, I mean, look.
His ice is all melted.

589
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:43,165
- This beer is...
- Oh my God.

590
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:46,436
It's warm.
He ain't coming back.

591
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:49,572
Okay, Sherlock, now that
you've used your CSI skills

592
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:51,106
to give us the time
of death on the beer,

593
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:54,579
- can we please go?
- All right, come on.

594
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:00,583
- Come on!
- No, come on, right now.

595
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:03,585
Let's get outta here, please.
Thank you.

596
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:06,456
They found the fisherman.

597
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:09,124
No one
reported him missing,

598
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:11,428
but work colleagues said

599
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,697
he had taken a week's
vacation to go fishing.

600
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:17,699
Uh, he was a really good guy.

601
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:19,102
Uh, very reliable,

602
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,870
fun to hang out with.

603
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:23,840
You know,
typical everyday guy.

604
00:33:23,842 --> 00:33:26,074
I saw him about
a week-and-a-half ago,

605
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:28,812
he turned me onto
this great new fishing hole.

606
00:33:28,814 --> 00:33:30,979
Uh, went there,
had a few beers,

607
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:32,817
you know, normal guy stuff.

608
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:36,786
This is it.

609
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:39,491
My new private fishing hole.

610
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:42,025
Don't let the chain fool you.

611
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:44,563
It is perfectly legal
to be in here.

612
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:54,069
I don't know what we're
gonna catch first,

613
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:57,675
a fish or a buzz, but I guess
it really doesn't matter, right?

614
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:02,845
This place is great.

615
00:34:02,847 --> 00:34:05,515
I mean,
they just found his body,

616
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:06,949
his skull was cracked open...

617
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:08,818
His brains were exposed.

618
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,653
I've never seen anything
quite like that.

619
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:15,224
Well, why did
he leave his things?

620
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:17,961
I mean, it's weird. He was like
trying to cook a fish over there.

621
00:34:17,963 --> 00:34:20,729
There was bones and shit but there
was like worms in the fucking ax.

622
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:22,499
I think we should get
the fuck outta here.

623
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:24,534
Look.
Someone's coming!

624
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:25,834
What the fuck
is the matter with this Guy?

625
00:34:25,836 --> 00:34:27,570
Maybe he's hurt,
I don't know.

626
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:29,137
Hey, buddy,
was that your shit back there?

627
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,572
I'm sorry.
We just didn't...

628
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:32,809
- Jesus Christ.
- What the fuck?

629
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:36,548
Stop! Stop!
Stop! What the fuck...

630
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:51,961
When authorities
discovered his body,

631
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:55,565
they also discovered
the camera

632
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,233
and the young man.

633
00:34:57,235 --> 00:35:00,135
The young woman
from the video,

634
00:35:00,137 --> 00:35:02,271
she wasn't found at the scene.

635
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:04,574
She turned up days later.

636
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,142
She tried to steal

637
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:09,547
someone's tablet computer.

638
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,853
Walked into a coffee shop,

639
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:20,055
saw the tablet sitting
on a table,

640
00:35:20,057 --> 00:35:21,824
picked it up,

641
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:24,126
walked out.

642
00:35:24,128 --> 00:35:26,565
Cops caught her
right outside.

643
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:32,168
She didn't resist.

644
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,304
She didn't say anything.

645
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,940
She still hasn't.

646
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:40,909
When the authorities found out
she had been flagged,

647
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:42,744
they brought her here.

648
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:46,215
They just got done
fighting over the two corpses.

649
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:49,885
Now there's
a feeding frenzy over her.

650
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,820
But I think
they're wasting their time.

651
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:56,025
The answers
aren't in the bodies.

652
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:57,961
They are in the book

653
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:00,829
and the videos.

654
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:03,701
And I think
I may have found...

655
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:08,838
a connection.

656
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,240
We have reports of the phenomena
in every country

657
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:13,041
with shores
along the Atlantic.

658
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:14,677
And it's spreading.

659
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,211
We had our first
U.S. case inland.

660
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:18,046
What happened?

661
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,950
Poor bastard, in a
supermarket in Buffalo

662
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:22,351
a guy worked
in the seafood section.

663
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:24,086
He stabbed
his co-worker to death.

664
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:26,655
He was caught at a bus station
trying to get to a Syracuse.

665
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:28,023
He offered no resistance,

666
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:29,825
just like the girl.

667
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:31,693
If you let me talk to the girl,

668
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:32,961
I can try to understand

669
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:35,231
what's happening
to the victims mentally.

670
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:38,034
I can try to find out what's
compelling them to the beach.

671
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:40,836
We're moving
the specimen today for tests.

672
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:43,805
No team member is getting near
her without protective clothing,

673
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:45,907
because we don't
what we're dealing with.

674
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,644
I know you've
been working hard,

675
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:50,679
but you need to stop
with these theories, okay?

676
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:52,215
You need to get
something to eat.

677
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:54,851
You need to get some sleep.
You need to call your family.

678
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:56,621
You need to...

679
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:01,057
Wait. Are you recording
this conversation?

680
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,159
- I'm keeping a record...
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?

681
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,297
Turn that thing off.
Turn that thing off and...

682
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,338
I've been put on a mandatory
leave of absence.

683
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:18,041
I have to leave
all files behind...

684
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:19,945
even this.

685
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:26,318
I feel like I'm getting
closer to the truth.

686
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,420
Good afternoon,
this is Ann Davis for News 7

687
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:34,956
your local news and here
are our top stories for today.

688
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,693
Six bodies
were found this morning

689
00:37:36,695 --> 00:37:39,996
at North Bay Beach
in an apparent mass murder.

690
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:41,264
According to the police,

691
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:43,132
the identities of these victims

692
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:44,733
have not been disclosed

693
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,869
as the brutality
of these murders

694
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:50,405
have made some of the victims
unidentifiable.

695
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,407
According to
the medical examiner

696
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:56,079
the victims heads
seem to have exploded.

697
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:59,315
This murder scene resembles
various other murders

698
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:02,818
that have come across the news
in recent weeks.

699
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,222
The police are investigating
any and all connections,

700
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:10,258
and we will continue to report
any updates here on News 7

701
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,831
as they come available.

702
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:21,470
In unrelated news,

703
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:23,940
two individuals believed to be
a man and a woman

704
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:27,342
robbed the First National Bank
on Oak Street earlier today

705
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:30,880
getting away with hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

706
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:33,014
Local police are asking
for any information

707
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:36,385
on these suspects
to call the police hotline

708
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:39,287
and do not approach
these individuals

709
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:42,393
as they may be
armed and dangerous.

710
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,954
Is it rolling, Blake?

711
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:15,760
Yeah, it's rolling.
It's our money now, bitches!

712
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:18,561
Did you see them freak?

713
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,796
I thought the bank teller
was gonna shit themselves!

714
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:22,231
And the lady,
when I stole her diamonds.

715
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:23,833
Fuck.

716
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,967
Yeah, we take from the bank
and the customers

717
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,202
for little old us.

718
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:29,338
No doubt.

719
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,909
- We're fucking bad asses.
- Holy shit.

720
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:34,443
Holy shit.

721
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:36,412
- Babe, check this out.
- Blake, get the camera.

722
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:41,117
- Get the camera. I wanna get a close up.
- All right, I'll get it.

723
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,354
Oh my God.

724
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:45,824
Oh my God.

725
00:39:48,226 --> 00:39:50,358
Doesn't this
look pretty on me?

726
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,963
You sexy bitch.

727
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:56,132
Oh my God, Blake.

728
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:58,771
There's so much money.

729
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:02,170
Oh, wow.

730
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:04,206
Oh my God.

731
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:05,575
All right,
put the camera down.

732
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:08,013
I want you to do me
on top of all this money.

733
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,954
You are a crazy bitch.

734
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,226
I fuckin' love you.

735
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:26,295
We're gonna go into the marina
and we're gonna steal a boat

736
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:30,233
and go wherever
the fuck we want.

737
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,336
Who the fuck is that?

738
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:34,973
Open the door!

739
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:39,641
Open the door!
Let me in!

740
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:41,276
What you want, motherfucker!

741
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:42,545
It's Sheriff fuckin' Williams.
Let me in!

742
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:44,546
There's some fuckin' crazy
people out here!

743
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:47,018
Let me fuckin' in!
Open the fuckin' door!

744
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,387
Oh my God.

745
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:53,956
I got a gun.

746
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,523
Blake, who is it?

747
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:57,260
I think it's the cops.

748
00:40:57,262 --> 00:41:00,499
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Relax, baby, I got this.

749
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:06,904
What the fuck?

750
00:41:09,606 --> 00:41:11,876
Hey come on, we gotta get
the fuck outta here.

751
00:41:13,945 --> 00:41:15,380
Come on, get dressed.

752
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:20,218
Give me the fuckin' gun.

753
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,487
- Get all the money.
- Leave the rest, come on.

754
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:26,222
Come on, grab the bag.

755
00:41:26,224 --> 00:41:27,626
Stay behind me.

756
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:37,970
- Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!
- No!

757
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:45,474
I can't get the others
to study the book.

758
00:41:45,476 --> 00:41:49,314
They won't watch
and examine the videos.

759
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,217
They will probably
file this all away

760
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:58,356
as soon as I leave.

761
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:09,634
Maybe that's the biggest irony.

762
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,972
This was written by a madman.

763
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:18,273
And he may have been
the sanest of us all.

764
00:42:18,275 --> 00:42:20,275
He was the only one capable

765
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:22,711
of trying

766
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:25,414
to make us understand

767
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,148
what was out there.

768
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,086
What if we're not dealing
with some mindless parasite

769
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:33,755
turning hosts

770
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:35,224
into brainless zombies?

771
00:42:35,226 --> 00:42:38,360
What if we're facing
an intelligence?

772
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:41,666
What if the man knew for years
what was coming?

773
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:45,467
He called himself a prophet.

774
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:47,939
Maybe that is what he was.

775
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:02,751
Maybe he was trying
to recruit the student

776
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:06,557
to carry on
or help with his work.

777
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:12,364
A messenger of sorts.

778
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:20,336
Could Lucas have had an inkling

779
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:23,742
of what fate
was in store for him?

780
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:27,443
Shooting himself

781
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:32,081
might have been the wisest
course of action.

782
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:35,217
But why?

783
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:38,356
What knowledge
drove him to that?

784
00:43:41,626 --> 00:43:43,394
Could it be...

785
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:15,590
Why are you filming this?

786
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:18,226
So the police will
know what happened.

787
00:44:18,228 --> 00:44:20,229
We're not murderers, Julie.

788
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:22,231
Nobody's killing anybody, okay?

789
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:25,200
I just need to talk to him.
That's all.

790
00:44:25,202 --> 00:44:27,806
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

791
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:31,673
Her husband

792
00:44:31,675 --> 00:44:34,876
and all these people,
these were people we knew,

793
00:44:34,878 --> 00:44:36,345
they went down by the river,

794
00:44:36,347 --> 00:44:39,217
and they started
acting weird.

795
00:44:42,586 --> 00:44:46,155
We didn't really wanna talk
about what we were gonna do.

796
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:47,692
We just knew it
was gonna get ugly.

797
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:50,226
Julie, stay close.

798
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:51,494
I'm gonna
talk with him, Will.

799
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:52,894
- Julie!
- Julie! Julie!

800
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:54,863
- Wait!
- Hey! Listen!

801
00:44:54,865 --> 00:44:56,831
- We can't be alone!
- We stay together!

802
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,834
Stick with the plan,
you understand me?

803
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:02,170
Anything bad happens,
I'm just gonna start shooting.

804
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:03,905
Yeah, let's hope it
doesn't come to that, huh?

805
00:45:03,907 --> 00:45:05,342
Okay.

806
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:09,612
Nick, it's me.

807
00:45:09,614 --> 00:45:12,751
Please look at me.
Nick, come home.

808
00:45:13,784 --> 00:45:15,217
I got you.

809
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:17,318
Nick, please look at me.

810
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,387
Nick, come home with me!

811
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:20,523
Julie.

812
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:22,891
Julie, step away from him.

813
00:45:22,893 --> 00:45:24,360
That is not Nick.

814
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:25,894
- What're we gonna do?
- I don't know!

815
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:27,632
Just stay calm and be quiet!

816
00:45:31,902 --> 00:45:33,469
What the fuck is this?

817
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:35,373
I don't know.
Just keep your eyes on 'em.

818
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,342
Hey, I got a real clear shot.

819
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:41,780
No, not with Julie there.

820
00:45:57,195 --> 00:45:58,894
- Will!
- Yeah?

821
00:45:58,896 --> 00:46:01,563
There's something in the water!

822
00:46:01,565 --> 00:46:03,434
You can see it in the video.

823
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:06,969
I didn't get
the best shot of it,

824
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:08,336
but it's big,

825
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:11,308
dark, cloudy...

826
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:14,876
and it's just
sort of writhing around.

827
00:46:14,878 --> 00:46:16,514
Julie, get away from him!

828
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:24,556
Run!

829
00:46:26,523 --> 00:46:28,757
Get to the truck!
Let's go!

830
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:30,461
Come on!

831
00:46:32,496 --> 00:46:35,731
So...

832
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:37,469
I made it to the truck.

833
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:40,305
I'm the only one.

834
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:45,441
It was like
one big hivemind

835
00:46:45,443 --> 00:46:47,376
serving that thing...

836
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:48,780
whatever it is.

837
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:54,883
But I saw it...
we saw it...

838
00:46:54,885 --> 00:46:56,655
and it's on the video.

839
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:01,356
I don't know what
that thing in the water was,

840
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,528
but whatever it is...

841
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:07,598
God have mercy our soul.

842
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:11,733
Subject
returning to the workplace.

843
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:14,003
Situation normal.

844
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:16,771
What about the casualties?
Or The Specimen?

845
00:47:16,773 --> 00:47:20,742
They're not the mission.

846
00:47:20,744 --> 00:47:22,945
Staying on target.

847
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:28,284
The patient...

848
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:31,787
the specimen...

849
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:34,789
whatever you want to call her...

850
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:36,494
escaped.

851
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:51,005
No one could have guessed

852
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:54,311
she was capable of violence.

853
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,947
She sent two to the hospital,

854
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:02,753
killed two more.

855
00:48:04,855 --> 00:48:07,990
My supervisor...

856
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:10,295
was among the dead.

857
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,001
So it turns out...

858
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:23,005
I'm not going
on mandatory leave...

859
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:24,840
after all.

860
00:48:24,842 --> 00:48:30,347
He never got a chance
to put in the paperwork.

861
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:37,820
The few remaining
team members

862
00:48:37,822 --> 00:48:39,921
are debating how she did it.

863
00:48:39,923 --> 00:48:44,059
You sound like a bunch
of pregnant fuckin' bitches!

864
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:47,061
You're fucking crying
about this and this!

865
00:48:47,063 --> 00:48:48,863
Frank's fucking dead!

866
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:50,865
Huh? HUH?

867
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:54,036
If we're dealing
with an organism

868
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:56,137
that burrows into the brain

869
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:58,507
to control the host,

870
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:03,380
maybe it can
also turn off pain.

871
00:49:18,695 --> 00:49:19,994
That the Specimen

872
00:49:19,996 --> 00:49:23,132
may have been
reaching for my laptop.

873
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:27,135
She was skimming
NASA pages,

874
00:49:27,137 --> 00:49:30,639
sites of space travel
and theory,

875
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:34,409
reading the biography pages
for astronauts

876
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:35,677
and astrophysicists.

877
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:39,882
She wanted
addresses and locations.

878
00:49:39,884 --> 00:49:41,450
What was she after?

879
00:49:41,452 --> 00:49:43,521
Who was she after?

880
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:48,692
Was it all just random?

881
00:49:53,797 --> 00:49:56,965
I haven't spoken to my family

882
00:49:56,967 --> 00:50:00,869
in ages.

883
00:50:00,871 --> 00:50:03,775
I have a husband
and a daughter.

884
00:50:06,976 --> 00:50:08,776
It's been so long.

885
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:10,945
Ahh!

886
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:12,014
Trying to scare me?

887
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:13,882
You think you're funny?

888
00:50:13,884 --> 00:50:15,784
- Play with the baby stick.
- Give me the stick.

889
00:50:15,786 --> 00:50:17,552
- No.
- Give...

890
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:18,757
No.

891
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:21,490
Whoa.

892
00:50:21,492 --> 00:50:23,891
Mom, I think I'm getting
a little big for the swing set.

893
00:50:23,893 --> 00:50:27,162
I close my eyes
to remember their faces.

894
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:32,066
And I hope
they remember mine.

895
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:34,470
I can't remember
the last time I slept.

896
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:37,005
I can't take the nightmares.

897
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:38,807
They're the kind
that wake you up

898
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,208
in a cold sweat,

899
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,679
leaving you
wondering where you are,

900
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:46,514
how you got there,

901
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:49,485
not knowing whether the dream

902
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:52,019
was the true reality

903
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:54,121
you just snapped out of.

904
00:50:54,123 --> 00:50:56,758
But there is this déjà vu

905
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,126
nagging at me.

906
00:50:58,128 --> 00:51:01,063
But it leaves the impression

907
00:51:01,065 --> 00:51:06,001
of somewhere and something wet

908
00:51:06,003 --> 00:51:09,173
and cold and old...

909
00:51:12,108 --> 00:51:14,943
Somewhere and something

910
00:51:14,945 --> 00:51:16,713
familiar.

911
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:28,090
And it's coming from darkness.

912
00:51:28,092 --> 00:51:30,695
And I'm waiting for it.

913
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:38,735
It's waiting for me.

914
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,027
And then he said,
"Where is the toast?"

915
00:52:40,697 --> 00:52:42,965
Hell's coming!

916
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,269
Shit!

917
00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:13,028
This will be my last entry.

918
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,197
I don't say that
to be melodramatic.

919
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:19,400
The word came down.

920
00:53:19,402 --> 00:53:23,137
The military is coming
to take over everything.

921
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:26,742
I don't know
what they expect to find.

922
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:30,048
I guess they
are as desperate as I am.

923
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:35,416
My colleagues,
what few were left,

924
00:53:35,418 --> 00:53:37,753
are gone.

925
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:41,222
They gave up, retreated.

926
00:53:41,224 --> 00:53:43,325
They don't know
what they're dealing with.

927
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:46,228
They just know it's winning.

928
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,195
So I'm alone here.

929
00:53:48,197 --> 00:53:51,199
Which is a cruel twist.

930
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:55,336
Because I finally have
what I was looking for.

931
00:53:55,338 --> 00:53:59,775
And there is no one
to show it to.

932
00:53:59,777 --> 00:54:01,742
Not that it matters.

933
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:04,014
They still wouldn't
believe me.

934
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:11,385
I doubt the military

935
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:14,125
will be any more open-minded.

936
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,733
Let's get the hell out of here.

937
00:54:26,302 --> 00:54:28,806
They still wouldn't believe me.

938
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:36,778
I'll be gone
before the soldiers roll in.

939
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,947
They can have this place.

940
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:42,686
They should rot here.

941
00:54:44,887 --> 00:54:47,822
I'm going to my family.

942
00:54:47,824 --> 00:54:50,761
I'm, I'm going home.

943
00:54:55,264 --> 00:54:58,432
But I need
to show this first.

944
00:54:58,434 --> 00:54:59,900
Yo, check it out.

945
00:54:59,902 --> 00:55:01,705
- What?
- What?

946
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,141
Dude, I don't like...
whoa, I don't like this.

947
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:08,776
What?
Why am I stopping?

948
00:55:08,778 --> 00:55:10,878
It's a chick.

949
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
- Oh, of course.
- Hey.

950
00:55:12,882 --> 00:55:14,117
You okay?

951
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:16,421
Where're you headed?

952
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:19,086
I think I hear him speak.

953
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:20,921
Location home.

954
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:24,092
- Uh, we can give you a ride.
- No! No, I'm sorry.

955
00:55:24,094 --> 00:55:25,526
We can't...
are you fucking kidding?

956
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:28,262
Hey come on, come on.
Don't be such a little bitch.

957
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:30,831
We're going to the beach.

958
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:32,833
Are my words in right?

959
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:34,469
Am I meaning there, too?

960
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:37,171
- Home please.
- Whoa, whoa, crazy lady!

961
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:40,275
No man, she needs
to go to a hospital.

962
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:42,043
Nah, she just needs a beer.

963
00:55:42,045 --> 00:55:43,945
I'm not fucking around!

964
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:47,816
Well, look. Tell me this
girl doesn't like to party.

965
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:49,217
She's all coked up.

966
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:50,519
Maybe she has something on her.
Check her.

967
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:53,287
- Guys, this is not cool.
- No fucking way.

968
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:55,289
I am not checking her.
She stinks.

969
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:57,992
Don't be such a pussy.
She's passed out.

970
00:55:57,994 --> 00:55:59,827
Who cares
what she smells like.

971
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,530
You know you'll bang her
if you get the chance.

972
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:03,532
I hear you
and someone understands me.

973
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:06,434
Okay, asshole. Somebody just
give me a tissue please.

974
00:56:06,436 --> 00:56:08,269
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

975
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:09,804
What do you mean what?
Look at her.

976
00:56:09,806 --> 00:56:11,572
She could barely walk.
Look, I swear to God.

977
00:56:11,574 --> 00:56:13,340
- If you guys do anything to her.
- Seriously.

978
00:56:13,342 --> 00:56:15,911
- What's your fucking problem?
- What's my problem?

979
00:56:15,913 --> 00:56:19,847
Hey, look at me. Jail.
Jail's my fucking problem, man.

980
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:21,383
Look, you don't get it,
do you?

981
00:56:21,385 --> 00:56:24,119
She's in no condition.
And if you do anything to her,

982
00:56:24,121 --> 00:56:26,521
anything at all
and she reports it to the cops,

983
00:56:26,523 --> 00:56:30,124
- you're fucked.
- When did you become such a fag?

984
00:56:30,126 --> 00:56:33,195
Uh, fuck you.
Nah, I'm outta here.

985
00:56:33,197 --> 00:56:34,528
Whoa.
Where the fuck are you going?

986
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,164
- Anywhere but here.
- Here motherfucker.

987
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,434
Yeah, you're walking.

988
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:41,139
Fuck you.

989
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:43,871
Shit.

990
00:56:43,873 --> 00:56:48,011
Waves.

991
00:57:02,592 --> 00:57:06,260
This is gonna be awesome.
She's so fucked up.

992
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:08,463
Are you ready not to wait?

993
00:57:08,465 --> 00:57:10,434
I'm ready for whatever.

994
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:15,572
The boy she had kissed
was gone.

995
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:20,344
Dude, what's wrong?

996
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:23,380
What the fuck?

997
00:57:24,414 --> 00:57:26,248
Oh God.

998
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,016
What the fuck
did you do to him?

999
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:29,383
You fucking whore!

1000
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:31,586
The other boy,

1001
00:57:31,588 --> 00:57:33,954
the boy who was filming

1002
00:57:33,956 --> 00:57:36,090
was lying there on the beach,

1003
00:57:36,092 --> 00:57:38,228
clutching the camera.

1004
00:57:56,947 --> 00:57:59,016
He was alive...

1005
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:04,121
but he was institutionalized.

1006
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:09,523
I was able to find out where

1007
00:58:09,525 --> 00:58:12,026
from the authorities

1008
00:58:12,028 --> 00:58:14,065
who sent me the video.

1009
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:23,137
They told me that
he hasn't spoken a single word

1010
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:25,407
since being found on the beach.

1011
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:31,079
So I asked questions
about him and his treatment.

1012
00:58:31,081 --> 00:58:35,717
They told me
he just sits alone all day

1013
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:39,387
and draws
odd pictures and shapes.

1014
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:42,958
They think it's all meaningless

1015
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,162
but they also see it
as therapeutic.

1016
00:58:48,164 --> 00:58:51,132
I asked if I could see

1017
00:58:51,134 --> 00:58:53,133
some of his drawings.

1018
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:56,239
And they sent me this.

1019
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:17,057
A homeless man.

1020
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:19,394
A teenager.

1021
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:21,396
They never met.

1022
00:59:21,398 --> 00:59:25,233
They had no mutual
acquaintances.

1023
00:59:25,235 --> 00:59:28,235
They lived near
the Atlantic Ocean,

1024
00:59:28,237 --> 00:59:32,606
but hundreds of miles apart.

1025
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:35,744
How is that

1026
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,579
they both drew the same thing?

1027
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:41,282
But I don't believe it,

1028
00:59:41,284 --> 00:59:43,017
and I don't care anymore.

1029
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:46,220
I don't care.

1030
00:59:46,222 --> 00:59:50,090
The nightmares are worse.

1031
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:54,695
Even when I don't sleep,

1032
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:58,402
there isn't any escape.

1033
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,538
Oh my God!

1034
01:00:22,224 --> 01:00:24,494
I just want to go home.

1035
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:32,103
I'm going home.

1036
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:56,490
Hey, stop where you are!

1037
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:58,392
- Put that down.
- I need to get out of here.

1038
01:00:58,394 --> 01:01:00,528
- I said put that down!
- Easy, Johnson.

1039
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:03,597
Johnson, stand down.

1040
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,400
She should just surrender.

1041
01:01:06,402 --> 01:01:08,202
You need to come with us now.

1042
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:09,771
- I need to get out.
- Negative.

1043
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:12,106
The facility's in lockdown.

1044
01:01:12,108 --> 01:01:13,374
No need to worry.

1045
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:14,708
We're debriefing
all remaining staff,

1046
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,211
and collecting all research.

1047
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:18,713
I have to get home
to my daughter.

1048
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:22,150
Hand those documents over now
and come with us.

1049
01:01:22,152 --> 01:01:24,786
I'm not finished with it.

1050
01:01:24,788 --> 01:01:27,791
We can't risk anything
getting out of this facility.

1051
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:31,525
What?

1052
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:33,528
You can't do this.

1053
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,396
I'm afraid I don't
have any choice.

1054
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:38,134
Orders.

1055
01:01:39,302 --> 01:01:41,802
Johnson, Rodriquez,
secure anyone you find.

1056
01:01:41,804 --> 01:01:43,271
Will do.

1057
01:01:43,273 --> 01:01:44,671
Reinforcements
should be here shortly.

1058
01:01:44,673 --> 01:01:46,309
Yes, sir.

1059
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:03,858
Are they dead?

1060
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,860
He definitely is.
They are, too.

1061
01:02:06,862 --> 01:02:09,329
Are you all right, huh?

1062
01:02:09,331 --> 01:02:11,331
You're the detective
from the video.

1063
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:13,267
You're the one
who sent us this.

1064
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,802
- Yeah.
- We need to get out of here.

1065
01:02:14,804 --> 01:02:17,871
Did you hear everything I said?
Did you hear what the guy said?

1066
01:02:17,873 --> 01:02:19,606
Reinforcements are coming.

1067
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:22,776
I'd be a death sentence
to go that way anyway.

1068
01:02:22,778 --> 01:02:25,512
So is there another exit?

1069
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:26,780
Yeah?

1070
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:28,184
Is it nearby?

1071
01:02:29,351 --> 01:02:30,386
Yeah?

1072
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:32,787
You're free to go.

1073
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:36,657
But first, you gotta
give me that book, okay?

1074
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:37,858
What?

1075
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,195
You gotta give me
that book, okay?

1076
01:02:40,197 --> 01:02:41,595
- What?
- The book.

1077
01:02:41,597 --> 01:02:44,264
It's been haunting me.
I'm hearing voices.

1078
01:02:44,266 --> 01:02:45,666
They were soft at first,

1079
01:02:45,668 --> 01:02:47,568
but now they're getting
louder and more insistent.

1080
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:50,237
That book called me here.
It's found this fuckin' place.

1081
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,273
I hear the voices, too.

1082
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:54,541
No, you don't. You're full of shit.
You do not.

1083
01:02:54,543 --> 01:02:56,711
That book had called me here
to serve it,

1084
01:02:56,713 --> 01:02:59,447
to protect it or something.

1085
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:00,715
But I say, fuck it.

1086
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:02,416
I'm here to destroy it.

1087
01:03:02,418 --> 01:03:03,684
No.

1088
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:05,788
I tried.
You can't.

1089
01:03:07,623 --> 01:03:09,791
What?
Hey, look.

1090
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:11,358
I don't wanna
argue with you,

1091
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,494
and, frankly,
I don't have the fuckin' time.

1092
01:03:13,496 --> 01:03:17,398
All right, but my life
has been fucked up

1093
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,932
ever since that book
came into it.

1094
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:22,369
And so it's gonna end
right here, right now.

1095
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:24,271
It's too valuable to destroy.

1096
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:27,275
- What do you mean?
- I've been studying this.

1097
01:03:27,277 --> 01:03:28,943
Whatever's going on,

1098
01:03:28,945 --> 01:03:31,949
this book is the key
to understanding it.

1099
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:36,252
Maybe even stopping it.

1100
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:39,554
Really?

1101
01:03:39,556 --> 01:03:42,257
If you're saying to me,
I mean, are you saying to me,

1102
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:44,525
that that book,
this book here...

1103
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:45,793
will make it better?

1104
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,896
All right.
Okay, listen.

1105
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:52,666
You take it
and you will leave

1106
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:55,836
and you will sneak out of
here and you're clever,

1107
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,307
and you get the fuck away
and you live.

1108
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:01,376
You understand me?
You live.

1109
01:04:01,378 --> 01:04:03,311
All right?
You can go.

1110
01:04:03,313 --> 01:04:05,313
- You're not coming?
- No, I'm not.

1111
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:07,014
I'm gonna stay
and buy you some time.

1112
01:04:07,016 --> 01:04:08,583
Handle these guys
with their guns, okay?

1113
01:04:08,585 --> 01:04:10,017
I understand that shit.
That's what I'm good at.

1114
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:11,619
It's normal to me.

1115
01:04:11,621 --> 01:04:14,054
Okay, that shit outside,
whatever's going on out there,

1116
01:04:14,056 --> 01:04:16,923
we're going to hell anyway,
right?

1117
01:04:16,925 --> 01:04:18,559
We won't need to.

1118
01:04:18,561 --> 01:04:20,394
Hell is coming to us.

1119
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:21,798
Go!

1120
01:04:48,057 --> 01:04:51,325
- Do you wanna try to stop her?
- Negative.

1121
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:53,797
She's finally leading us
to the Higher Intelligence.

1122
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:57,532
Yeah, but you
know what's gonna happen

1123
01:04:57,534 --> 01:04:58,666
when she goes home.

1124
01:04:58,668 --> 01:05:00,802
Our task is
to observe and report.

1125
01:05:00,804 --> 01:05:02,840
End of conversation.

1126
01:05:19,922 --> 01:05:24,659
And here we have dad who thinks he's
a 19-year-old college sophomore.

1127
01:05:24,661 --> 01:05:26,059
What do you want?

1128
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:28,128
I wanna know why you have
a mid-life crisis mobile.

1129
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:30,130
I don't have
a mid-life crisis mobile, okay?

1130
01:05:30,132 --> 01:05:32,934
It's, it's good on gas
and it gets me around.

1131
01:05:32,936 --> 01:05:34,668
And it makes you
look like a kid.

1132
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,037
What do you want?

1133
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:37,905
I think you're trying to
impress the neighbor.

1134
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:40,074
Go... play in traffic
or something.

1135
01:05:40,076 --> 01:05:42,976
- - My name is
Daniela Belea. I live on Maple Lane

1136
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:45,512
- Middleton, New Jersey.
- Uh, what is that?

1137
01:05:45,514 --> 01:05:47,782
I don't know, Dad. There's some
crazy lady banging on the door.

1138
01:05:47,784 --> 01:05:49,083
- What are you doing?
- I'm filming it

1139
01:05:49,085 --> 01:05:50,550
in case we have
to show the cops.

1140
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:51,985
- Cops? Hello?
- Grab your things!

1141
01:05:51,987 --> 01:05:53,454
- Can I help...
- Grab your things!

1142
01:05:53,456 --> 01:05:55,021
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- We need to go!

1143
01:05:55,023 --> 01:05:56,624
- What're you doing?
- It's all in here,

1144
01:05:56,626 --> 01:05:58,959
but there's no time to explain!
We need to head west.

1145
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:00,862
You need to get out
of my house right now!

1146
01:06:00,864 --> 01:06:02,963
Your house?
What do you mean?

1147
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:05,800
Ma'am, I don't know if you're high or
if you're crazy or if you're drunk,

1148
01:06:05,802 --> 01:06:07,534
but you need to leave
right now!

1149
01:06:07,536 --> 01:06:08,802
It's our house.
It's me.

1150
01:06:08,804 --> 01:06:10,570
Why are acting like
you don't know me?

1151
01:06:10,572 --> 01:06:11,838
Because I don't,
I don't.

1152
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,141
- You do.
- No, look, I have seen...

1153
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:15,075
- You do know me. It's me.
- No, I don't.

1154
01:06:15,077 --> 01:06:16,811
I've seen you around the
neighborhood jogging before, yes,

1155
01:06:16,813 --> 01:06:18,780
but I don't know your name,
I don't know where you're from.

1156
01:06:18,782 --> 01:06:20,081
Now if you do not
leave right now,

1157
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,682
- I am calling the police.
- What?

1158
01:06:21,684 --> 01:06:24,786
What are you talking about?
It's me, sweetie.

1159
01:06:24,788 --> 01:06:26,653
I'm your wife.

1160
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:28,121
What's wrong with you?

1161
01:06:28,123 --> 01:06:29,891
- Dad.
- Pumpkin?

1162
01:06:29,893 --> 01:06:31,425
- It's me. It's Mommy.
- Dad!

1163
01:06:31,427 --> 01:06:33,528
What's wrong with you?
Okay, I'm a widower.

1164
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,930
My wife... her mom...
died five years ago, okay?

1165
01:06:36,932 --> 01:06:38,800
Oh, no, that can't be.

1166
01:06:38,802 --> 01:06:41,903
You need to leave right
now or I'm calling the police.

1167
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:43,204
- I don't know,
I think she's high or...

1168
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:44,539
- I don't want to do this.

1169
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,173
- Please.
- Get back. Get back.

1170
01:06:46,175 --> 01:06:49,476
Miss, Miss.
She's bleeding.

1171
01:06:49,478 --> 01:06:52,512
Miss, let me help you, okay,
let me call you an ambulance.

1172
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:53,914
- Run!
- Let me get you some help.

1173
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:54,981
- Please.
- Before it's too late.

1174
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:57,684
- Let me help you.
- Run.

1175
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:12,101
I need your phone.

1176
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,983
Now the real work begins.

1177
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:35,159
What have I done?

1178
01:07:37,527 --> 01:07:41,097
If that is not my family,
so who are they?

1179
01:07:44,634 --> 01:07:46,170
Where's my home?

1180
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:51,873
I just keep hearing it,
home, home.

1181
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:54,210
Get out of my head!

1182
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:58,548
Shut up.

1183
01:08:02,184 --> 01:08:04,918
Where's my house?

1184
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,054
It needs to be
over here somewhere.

1185
01:08:07,056 --> 01:08:09,525
I know I live over here.

1186
01:08:11,193 --> 01:08:12,929
Where's my home?

1187
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:16,934
I hear it.

1188
01:08:19,202 --> 01:08:22,539
I hear home, home, home.

1189
01:09:08,016 --> 01:09:09,853
My home.

1190
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:16,193
- Home.
- Home.

1191
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,195
Home.

1192
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:27,034
Messiah has come.

1193
01:09:27,036 --> 01:09:29,637
Reveal the One Who Walks Beyond.

1194
01:09:29,639 --> 01:09:31,705
- Home.
- Home.

1195
01:09:31,707 --> 01:09:34,008
- Home.
- Home.

1196
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:36,643
- Home.
- Home.

1197
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:38,912
- Home.
- Home.

1198
01:09:38,914 --> 01:09:41,781
- Home.
- Home.

1199
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:43,384
- Home.
- Home.

1200
01:09:50,993 --> 01:09:52,793
Hey! Get up here!

1201
01:09:52,795 --> 01:09:55,028
I got a truck. This place is
crawling with these things!

1202
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,600
I can get us to safety.
Come on.

1203
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:06,706
Hey.

1204
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:09,309
I'm not crazy.

1205
01:10:09,311 --> 01:10:12,379
I've seen that thing
with my own two eyes.

1206
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:13,916
I can help.

1207
01:10:25,328 --> 01:10:28,198
Obstacle defeated.
Subject free to continue.

1208
01:11:14,777 --> 01:11:16,210
I'm sorry for your loss,

1209
01:11:16,212 --> 01:11:18,845
but I'm gonna need to ask you
a few questions.

1210
01:11:18,847 --> 01:11:20,313
So if you could
just help me out.

1211
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:22,249
I'm trying to understand
what happened to you today.

1212
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:23,854
Excuse me please.

1213
01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:32,992
- No sir.
- No! No!

1214
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:35,364
Jesus, get him off me!

1215
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:47,875
Wait.

1216
01:11:47,877 --> 01:11:49,777
Don't go.

1217
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:51,214
You...

1218
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:55,284
I recognize you.

1219
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,420
I do.

1220
01:12:00,422 --> 01:12:03,893
Your the one who gave
the two students this.

1221
01:12:06,796 --> 01:12:09,196
I knew you before that.

1222
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:10,934
What?

1223
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,367
Mommy.

1224
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:15,835
What?

1225
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:17,340
What did you call me?

1226
01:12:19,274 --> 01:12:21,174
Mommy?

1227
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:23,179
They wouldn't
let you keep me.

1228
01:12:25,014 --> 01:12:28,782
They did what they had to do
and then they released you.

1229
01:12:28,784 --> 01:12:30,284
And people said that you
had lost your way,

1230
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:33,056
- but I knew it wasn't true.
- Why are you doing that to me?

1231
01:12:35,358 --> 01:12:38,092
They came in the boat.

1232
01:12:38,094 --> 01:12:40,827
And they killed daddy.

1233
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:42,399
And they took you.

1234
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,267
Oh my God.

1235
01:12:46,269 --> 01:12:48,137
Oh my God.

1236
01:12:52,207 --> 01:12:54,076
I can believe...

1237
01:12:55,211 --> 01:12:57,844
Oh, no.
They made me their prophet.

1238
01:12:57,846 --> 01:13:00,580
They made you their messiah.

1239
01:13:00,582 --> 01:13:02,085
The chose you.

1240
01:13:03,586 --> 01:13:05,518
I never wanted that.

1241
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,088
Please.

1242
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,391
You never wanted that?

1243
01:13:10,393 --> 01:13:12,492
Kill me.

1244
01:13:12,494 --> 01:13:14,495
Please kill me.

1245
01:13:14,497 --> 01:13:15,963
You never wanted that.

1246
01:13:15,965 --> 01:13:18,398
No, I want you.

1247
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,967
I wanted you.

1248
01:13:19,969 --> 01:13:21,335
You don't want me!

1249
01:13:21,337 --> 01:13:24,905
- I love you.
- You don't want me!

1250
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:26,440
I didn't have any control.

1251
01:13:26,442 --> 01:13:29,043
I want you.
I love you.

1252
01:13:29,045 --> 01:13:32,213
They're in my head, mommy.
They're in my head, mommy.

1253
01:13:32,215 --> 01:13:34,848
- I love you.
- For years.

1254
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,384
Baby, I know.
I know, baby.

1255
01:13:37,386 --> 01:13:38,585
I know.

1256
01:13:38,587 --> 01:13:40,920
They chose you.

1257
01:13:40,922 --> 01:13:42,488
- I was weak.
- They chose you.

1258
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:45,992
And now your job is done.

1259
01:13:45,994 --> 01:13:47,494
- Come with me.
- It's too late.

1260
01:13:47,496 --> 01:13:49,597
Come with me please.

1261
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:52,566
It's too late.
Mommy, it's too late.

1262
01:13:52,568 --> 01:13:55,268
It's not too late.

1263
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,905
- It's too late.
- It's not too late.

1264
01:13:57,907 --> 01:13:59,906
Please.

1265
01:13:59,908 --> 01:14:02,343
It's too late.

1266
01:14:02,345 --> 01:14:04,143
- No!
- It's too late!

1267
01:14:04,145 --> 01:14:08,048
No, it's not, it's not!
You come with me!

1268
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:09,884
Please come with me.

1269
01:14:09,886 --> 01:14:12,322
Please don't do this.

1270
01:15:00,235 --> 01:15:01,468
This is it.

1271
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:04,571
Finally what we came here for.
Stay focused.

1272
01:15:04,573 --> 01:15:07,174
Miller, this situation is out
of control and dangerous.

1273
01:15:07,176 --> 01:15:09,076
Johnson,
I'm calling it in.

1274
01:15:09,078 --> 01:15:12,245
Headquarters is ready to send
military backup on my word.

1275
01:15:12,247 --> 01:15:14,180
Stay focused.

1276
01:15:14,182 --> 01:15:15,683
She is the key to the source.

1277
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:18,619
She's always been the key.

1278
01:15:18,621 --> 01:15:21,591
Yeah well, I don't think
she's here alone.

1279
01:15:24,193 --> 01:15:25,628
Johnson!

1280
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:38,973
What do you think
you're doing?

1281
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:40,974
Look, we don't want any trouble.

1282
01:15:40,976 --> 01:15:43,110
Just in the wrong place.
That's it.

1283
01:15:43,112 --> 01:15:45,611
Just tell your creatures
to let us go.

1284
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:47,613
I don't think so.

1285
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:49,616
I think you're after my mom.

1286
01:15:49,618 --> 01:15:52,389
I think the CIA has been
tracking our every move.

1287
01:15:54,256 --> 01:15:56,022
We know
what's you're going to do,

1288
01:15:56,024 --> 01:15:59,058
- and we're gonna stop it.
- You don't know shit.

1289
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:02,629
And anyways,
it's too late.

1290
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,764
You're the boy from the boat.

1291
01:16:04,766 --> 01:16:06,433
Hey, we're trying to find you.

1292
01:16:06,435 --> 01:16:07,567
We tried to help you.

1293
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,570
You did?

1294
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:11,271
I was underground.

1295
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:13,040
Not all of our followers
survived.

1296
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:15,442
But the ones that did...

1297
01:16:15,444 --> 01:16:17,143
are loyal.

1298
01:16:17,145 --> 01:16:20,481
They're loyal to me,
to my mom...

1299
01:16:20,483 --> 01:16:22,585
to the master.

1300
01:16:27,055 --> 01:16:30,057
I know now the real reason

1301
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:34,193
why the government
hired me.

1302
01:16:34,195 --> 01:16:36,429
They knew
I had a connection

1303
01:16:36,431 --> 01:16:39,168
to the master.

1304
01:16:40,703 --> 01:16:43,704
After the boat accident,

1305
01:16:43,706 --> 01:16:48,174
I lost most of my memories

1306
01:16:48,176 --> 01:16:52,211
especially of my real husband

1307
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:54,083
and my son.

1308
01:17:10,733 --> 01:17:13,733
My son didn't get
the title right.

1309
01:17:13,735 --> 01:17:15,468
The seas from whence they came?

1310
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:17,071
That's wrong.

1311
01:17:17,073 --> 01:17:19,376
There's no "they."
There's only "it."

1312
01:17:20,509 --> 01:17:23,177
And it's not from the seas.

1313
01:17:23,179 --> 01:17:24,844
The seas
are where it is now,

1314
01:17:24,846 --> 01:17:28,581
but that's not where
it comes from.

1315
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:32,186
It comes from somewhere else.

1316
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:35,289
It doesn't belong here.
It doesn't want to be here.

1317
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:38,424
It was ripped from a place
we'll never know.

1318
01:17:38,426 --> 01:17:40,393
A place we'll never understand.

1319
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:42,329
It was here before all of us.

1320
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:44,164
I'm not a prophet.

1321
01:17:44,166 --> 01:17:45,598
I'm the messiah.

1322
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,402
It is part of me equally.

1323
01:17:48,404 --> 01:17:50,774
We are separate and one.

1324
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:55,209
It can force me to understand,

1325
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:59,112
and that's how I know
exactly what it is

1326
01:17:59,114 --> 01:18:01,882
and exactly what it wants.

1327
01:18:01,884 --> 01:18:04,351
It's just a new beginning.

1328
01:18:04,353 --> 01:18:06,553
A new end.

1329
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:08,554
The wait is over.

1330
01:18:08,556 --> 01:18:10,126
Its time is now.

1331
01:18:22,438 --> 01:18:24,771
I'm the messiah chosen

1332
01:18:24,773 --> 01:18:27,644
to show you what's coming.

1333
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:42,156
I wanted to go home.

1334
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:45,261
And it wants to go home, too.

1335
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,702
And only one of us
will get to do that now.

1336
01:19:24,966 --> 01:19:27,901
Wait a minute.
Are you recording this?

1337
01:19:27,903 --> 01:19:30,269
- - Are you
out of your goddamn mind?

1338
01:19:30,271 --> 01:19:31,537
Turn that off.

1339
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:34,210
Please, erase all this.
Not cool.

1340
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:54,260
You better hope you're dead.

1341
01:19:54,262 --> 01:19:55,765
Cut.

1342
01:19:59,268 --> 01:20:01,701
And, action!

1343
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:03,570
Open this door!

1344
01:20:03,572 --> 01:20:04,972
Open this fucking door!

1345
01:20:04,974 --> 01:20:07,310
It's open already.
It should be locked.

1346
01:20:23,725 --> 01:20:26,328
And, cut.
Uh, yeah, that it was great.

1347
01:20:28,697 --> 01:20:30,964
No sound!

1348
01:20:30,966 --> 01:20:32,598
- No sound!
- No sound! No sound!

1349
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,971
No sound.

1350
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:40,540
But keep going,
but no sound.

1351
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:42,345
Action!

1352
01:20:45,314 --> 01:20:46,649
We have been...

1353
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,450
We have been shar...

1354
01:20:50,452 --> 01:20:51,652
Oh, fuck.

1355
01:20:51,654 --> 01:20:53,323
We have been sharing...

1356
01:20:57,693 --> 01:20:59,026
We have...

1357
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:02,396
We have been sharing
other information with...

1358
01:21:02,398 --> 01:21:03,897
What the fuck!

1359
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:06,603
You guys getting me nervous,
man.

1360
01:21:10,372 --> 01:21:12,039
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

1361
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:14,508
Actual sound.

1362
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:16,843
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

1363
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:20,583
- Two take seven.
- Rolling, rolling, get ready.

1364
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:24,518
Cut!
Let's kill it one to ten!

1365
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,053
That was a six.
I want to see a ten.

1366
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:28,857
Go for it!

1367
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,306
Action!

1368
01:21:49,578 --> 01:21:50,843
I can see the light.

1369
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:52,478
I can see the light.

1370
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,746
Can you see the light?

1371
01:21:53,748 --> 01:21:55,882
I can see the light.

1372
01:21:55,884 --> 01:21:57,683
Right now you're saying,
I am God.

1373
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,119
I am God!

1374
01:21:59,121 --> 01:22:02,723
You are God.

1375
01:22:02,725 --> 01:22:04,090
Say, "I'm the Messiah."

1376
01:22:04,092 --> 01:22:05,558
I'm the Messiah.

1377
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,827
You are the Messiah.

1378
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:09,629
Say, "You love me."

1379
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:12,568
- Do you love me?
- I love you.

1380
01:22:23,145 --> 01:22:24,847
Roll camera.

1381
01:22:27,682 --> 01:22:30,586
Scene Edward six,
take one.

1382
01:22:31,453 --> 01:22:32,622
All right.

1383
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:38,058
Okay, ready?

1384
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,929
And, action!

1385
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:54,441
- I'm in the right place.
- Yes, sir.

1386
01:22:54,443 --> 01:22:56,476
Excuse me.

1387
01:22:56,478 --> 01:22:58,381
I humbly apologize.

1388
01:23:06,488 --> 01:23:08,754
Cut!

1389
01:23:08,756 --> 01:23:11,960
- Great! Cool!
- That was awesome!

1390
01:23:24,506 --> 01:23:26,973
Squirt.

1391
01:23:26,975 --> 01:23:29,108
Cool.

1392
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,813
Parasite.

1393
01:23:39,121 --> 01:23:40,989
Cut.

1394
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:02,476
Three, two, one!

1395
01:24:02,478 --> 01:24:05,581
Oh, that's not really pumping.

1396
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:25,632
Ready?

1397
01:24:25,634 --> 01:24:29,104
Rolling, rolling, get ready
and, action!

1398
01:24:35,511 --> 01:24:36,946
And, cut!

1399
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:36,005
And cut on rehearsal.
I want to play back on that.

1400
01:25:54,789 --> 01:25:56,792
All right, and, action,
Carlos...

1401
01:26:01,296 --> 01:26:03,099
And, cut.

1402
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,950
Thank you.

1403
01:26:23,952 --> 01:26:26,652
- I'm happy to be here.
- Well, we are, too.

1404
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:27,987
So, uh, where are you from?

1405
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:30,223
- I'm from Brazil.
- Brazil.

1406
01:26:30,225 --> 01:26:32,659
That's beautiful.

1407
01:26:32,661 --> 01:26:35,361
They got any dead bodies
floating up down there?

1408
01:26:35,363 --> 01:26:37,196
Still rolling
Let's reset back to one.

1409
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:40,702
Back to one!
Let's go right back into it.

1410
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:09,361
And, cut! Okay.

1411
01:27:09,363 --> 01:27:11,600
Great, cool, very good.

1412
01:27:47,469 --> 01:27:49,736
We need to fucking jump out
a fucking window.

1413
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:51,403
That's what it is.

1414
01:28:17,298 --> 01:28:18,967
Ahh!

1415
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:23,439
Get out!
Get out!

1416
01:28:56,304 --> 01:28:58,437
Keep rolling.

1417
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:01,107
Good. Turn towards us like you're
trying to get it out of your mouth.

1418
