1
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,730
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,990
- Yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,780
- Who're you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,740
- Well, what number are
you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,160
- Well, I think you have
the wrong number.
- Do I?

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,830
It happens. Take it easy.

7
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,681
- Hello.
- I'm sorry. I guess I dialled
the wrong number.

8
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,221
- So why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

9
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,892
- You're forgiven. Bye now.
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

10
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:56,692
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

11
00:00:56,812 --> 00:00:59,982
They've got 900 numbers for that.
See ya.

12
00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:24,003
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

13
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,973
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.

14
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:31,853
- I don't think so.
- What's that noise?

15
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:34,143
- Popcorn.
- You're making popcorn?

16
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:37,103
- Uh-huh.
- I only eat popcorn at the movies.

17
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:40,563
- Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.
- Really? What?

18
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:44,114
- Oh, just some scary movie.
- Do you like scary movies?

19
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:47,074
- Uh-huh.
- What's your favourite scary movie?

20
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,994
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favourite.

21
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:52,074
What comes to mind?

22
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,794
Um, "Halloween. "

23
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:59,465
You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask who walks around
and stalks baby-sitters.

24
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,545
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

25
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:06,175
- Guess.
- Um, "Nightmare on Elm Street".

26
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:10,135
- Is that the one where the guy
had knives for fingers?
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.

27
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:13,976
Freddy, that's right.
I liked that movie. It was scary.

28
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:16,646
Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

29
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:19,186
So, you got a boyfriend?

30
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,986
Why? You wanna ask me out
on a date?

31
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:25,366
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

32
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:28,246
- No.
- You never told me your name.

33
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:32,166
- Why do you want to know my name?
- 'Cause I want to know
who I'm looking at.

34
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,786
What did you say?

35
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,126
I want to know
who I'm talking to.

36
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:41,256
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

37
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:46,847
What?

38
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,057
Hello?

39
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:52,847
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.

40
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:55,187
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

41
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:58,527
Don't hang up on me!

42
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:09,078
Shit. Yes?

43
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:11,998
I told you not to hang up on me.

44
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:14,118
- What do you want?
- To talk.

45
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:17,038
Well, dial someone else, okay?

46
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,889
- Listen, asshole-
- No, you listen, you little bitch.

47
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,189
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

48
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,859
- Yeah.
- Is this some kind of joke?

49
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,569
More of a game, really.

50
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:47,569
Can you handle that, blondie?

51
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,710
Can you see me?

52
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,180
Listen. I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,561
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

54
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:17,271
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

55
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,282
Who's there?

56
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:29,492
Who's there?

57
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:31,952
I'm calling the police.

58
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:39,462
You should never say "Who's there?"
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

59
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:43,882
You might as well
just come out here to investigate
a strange noise or something.

60
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:49,302
Look, you've had your fun now, so
I think you better just leave or else.

61
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:51,262
Or else what?

62
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:55,812
Or else my boyfriend'll be here
any second and he'll be pissed
when he finds out.

63
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:59,903
- I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
- I lied! I do have a boyfriend...

64
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:02,483
and he'll be here any second,
so your ass better be gone.

65
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:05,653
- Sure.
- I swear.

66
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:11,783
He's big and he plays football,
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

67
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:15,834
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

68
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:18,044
So you better just leave.

69
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:21,714
His name wouldn't be Steve,
would it?

70
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:25,964
How do you know his name?

71
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:28,684
Turn on the patio lights...

72
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:30,765
again.

73
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,575
Oh, God!

74
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,995
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Where are you? Where are you?

75
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,205
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

76
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,415
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?

77
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,955
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

78
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:57,625
- Then he dies right now.
- No! No! No!

79
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,965
Which is it?

80
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,546
Which is it?

81
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:06,096
Well, what kind of a game?

82
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:10,726
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

83
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,266
Just do it!

84
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:18,186
No, Casey! No! No!

85
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,277
No, Casey!

86
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,607
Here's how we play.

87
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:26,197
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

88
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,947
- Please don't do this.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

89
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:31,577
- Please-
- It's an easy category.
- Please.

90
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:36,088
- Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.

91
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,588
- Name the killer in "Halloween. "
- No.

92
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,588
Come on! It's your favourite
scary movie, remember?

93
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,928
- He had a white mask.
He stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.

94
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:48,928
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

95
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,808
- What's his name?
- I- I can't think.

96
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:55,358
Steve's counting on you.

97
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:57,898
Michael-
Michael Meyers.

98
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:00,528
Yes! Very good.

99
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:02,608
Now for the real question.

100
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:05,318
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

101
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:08,409
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!

102
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,329
Then answer the question.
Same category.

103
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,959
Oh, please stop.

104
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,089
Name the killer in
"Friday the 13th. "

105
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,629
Jason! Jason, Jason!

106
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,260
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

107
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,140
No, it's not!
No, it's not. It was Jason.

108
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,560
Afraid not. No way.

109
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,440
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddam times!

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,650
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs Voorhees, was the original killer.

111
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,020
Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.

112
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,111
I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.

113
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:46,071
- You tricked me.
- Lucky for you there's a bonus round.

114
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:49,911
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!

115
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:18,272
Hey, we're not finished yet.

116
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:24,362
Final question.
Are you ready?

117
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:27,162
Please, please, leave me alone.

118
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:29,242
Answer the question,
and I will.

119
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:34,163
What door am I at?

120
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:37,623
- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.

121
00:08:37,753 --> 00:08:39,713
The front door
and the patio doors.

122
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:44,053
If you answer correctly,
you live. Very simple.

123
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:47,434
Don't do this.
I can't. I won't.

124
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,724
Your call.

125
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,780
Did you water
over here today?

126
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,700
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

127
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,700
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.

128
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,330
Mom!

129
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,660
- Jesus!
- What is it?

130
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:38,511
Casey!

131
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,271
Oh, G-

132
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:50,232
Casey. Casey. Casey!

133
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,572
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

134
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:02,753
- Casey! Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

135
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:05,133
- Where is she?
- She's- She's here.

136
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:07,253
- Mom.
- Oh, my God, I, I can hear her.

137
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:10,713
- Mom.
- Where is she?

138
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,803
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

139
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,893
Hey!

140
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:24,063
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

141
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,813
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

142
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:29,023
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

143
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:13,326
- It's just me.
- Billy, what the-
What are you doing here?

144
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:16,416
- Sorry, don't hate me.
- Oh, my God!
- What, do you sleep in that?

145
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:19,586
Yes, I sleep in this. You gotta go.
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

146
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:23,916
- Okay, I'll just stay a sec.
- No- You can't be in here.
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go, go, go.

147
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:28,136
- What's going on in there? Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

148
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:33,096
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.
- No?

149
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:35,596
Oh, well.
I'm hittin' the sack.

150
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:38,146
My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.

151
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:41,567
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

152
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,107
- There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at-
- The Hilton.

153
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:46,947
- Out at the airport, so call if-
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.

154
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,027
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.

155
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:54,827
- Have a good trip, okay?
- Sleep tight, sweetie.

156
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:04,258
- Oh, close call.
- Billy, what're you doing here?

157
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:08,508
- Well, it occurred to me that I've
never snuck through your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.

158
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,968
Great idea. Now that
it's out of your system.

159
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:14,139
You know, I was home
watching television. The, uh-

160
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,899
"The Exorcist" was on.
It got me thinking of you.

161
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,189
- It did?
- Yeah, it was edited for TV.

162
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,859
You know, all the good stuff was cut
out. And it got me thinking of us...

163
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:32,369
how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.

164
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,659
Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

165
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,629
And now
things have changed and...

166
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,970
lately we're just sort of
edited for television.

167
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:56,100
Oh, so you thought you would
climb in my window and we'd have
a little raw footage?

168
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,521
No. No, I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

169
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:06,071
I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

170
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:13,701
- Okay.
- Yeah?

171
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:19,002
- Yeah.
- If we ever fly away

172
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:23,462
Baby, I'm with you

173
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:28,382
Baby, I'm your man

174
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,472
Hey.

175
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,902
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-bucket.

176
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,573
God, you see what
you do to me?

177
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,623
You know what
my dad'll do to you?

178
00:15:56,743 --> 00:16:00,083
Yeah. I'm going.

179
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:02,173
Okay.

180
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,094
Romeo and Juliet

181
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:10,014
Are together in eternity

182
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,684
You know, I- I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

183
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:15,354
So, come on, baby

184
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,104
Hey, about the, uh-
the sex stuff...

185
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,814
I- I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

186
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:26,325
- I was only half serious.
- Okay.

187
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,615
Baby, I'm your man

188
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:35,245
Baby, I'm your man

189
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,415
Hey, Billy.

190
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:41,295
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

191
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,375
What's that?

192
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:52,885
My God.
You're just a tease.

193
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,986
Thirty-five-

194
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,736
Situation under control.

195
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,196
Roger, dispatch.

196
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:12,707
There's blood found?
All right.

197
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,848
They are doing drugs that
they buy in the classrooms...

198
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:32,018
and that they are
involved in the occult.

199
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,098
Occult?

200
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:40,728
Woodsboro, California, was devastated
last night when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

201
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:44,238
Authorities have yet to issue
a statement, but our sources tell us...

202
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,858
that no arrest has been made
and the murderer could strike again.

203
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:49,948
- Do you believe this shit?
- Damn! What is going on?

204
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:52,078
- You don't know?
- No.

205
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:56,538
- Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.
- What? No way.

206
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:59,708
And we're not just talking killed.
We're talking splatter-movie killed.

207
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:01,799
Ripped open
from end to end.

208
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,429
- Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.
- Not any more. It's so sad.

209
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:10,139
Her mom and dad, they found her hanging
from a tree, her insides on the outside.

210
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,769
Oh, my God!
Do they know who did it?

211
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,099
Fucking clueless. I mean, they're
interrogating the entire school.

212
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,690
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?

213
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,440
They don't know. I mean,
Dewey was saying this is the
worst crime they've seen in years.

214
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,740
Even worse than-

215
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,450
Well, it's bad.

216
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:37,751
- Here you go, Mrs Tate.
- Thank you, James.

217
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:44,511
Sidney. It would appear
to be your turn.

218
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:51,851
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.
- Prescott.

219
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:54,641
She was daughter of, uh-

220
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:58,601
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

221
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:02,571
- Hi, Sidney.
- Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

222
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:06,992
Uh, that's Deputy Riley
today, Sid.

223
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,782
- How is everything?
- Good.

224
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,952
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

225
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:16,372
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.

226
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:20,172
- The police just want to ask you
a few questions. You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,423
Sidney, were you very
close to Casey Becker?

228
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:27,093
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

229
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:31,683
All students are encouraged
to return to their homes promptly
from school grounds. Avoid strangers.

230
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,513
- Walk in twos and threes.
Counsellors will be here tomorrow.
- What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

231
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:37,183
- Thank you.
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- Yeah, they asked me that too.

232
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,694
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

233
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:43,774
- Did they ask you?
- Hunt? Why would they ask you
if you like to hunt?

234
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:46,534
'Cause their bodies
were gutted.

235
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:49,574
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

236
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:52,704
- It's 'cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.

237
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,414
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct. "

238
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,834
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

239
00:19:57,954 --> 00:20:00,414
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

240
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:03,424
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

241
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:07,594
- Or a man's mentality.
- How do you gut someone?

242
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:16,395
You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.

243
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,735
Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.

244
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:22,735
Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?

245
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,445
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she dumped you for Steve.

246
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,906
- I thought you dumped her for me.
- I did. He's full of shit.

247
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:31,536
And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

248
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:34,246
Hey, what're you saying?
That- That- That I killed her?

249
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:38,916
- It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."
- Stu was with me last night, okay?

250
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:43,836
- Yeah, I was.
- Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

251
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:47,387
- Fuck you, nut case.
Where were you last night?
- Working, thank you.

252
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:52,887
- Oh, at the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.
- Twice.

253
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:56,647
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

254
00:20:56,767 --> 00:21:02,737
Thanks, buddy. Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

255
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:08,197
- I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.
- Tell me something. Did you really
put her liver in the mailbox?

256
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:12,367
'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the mailbox
next to her spleen and her pancreas.

257
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:15,037
Randy, you goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here. Okay?

258
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:18,668
She's getting mad, all right?
You better "liver" alone.

259
00:21:21,508 --> 00:21:24,468
"Liver" alone!

260
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:30,718
"Liv-" Ow! "Liver. Liver. Liv-"
It was a joke.

261
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:39,479
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

262
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,630
So, you sure I can stay over, 'cause
my dad won't be back till Sunday.

263
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,390
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practise.

264
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,470
You okay?

265
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,980
Uh-huh. It's just, you know,
the police and reporters...

266
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,730
and everything,
it's like deja vu all over again.

267
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,230
I'll be there by 7:00,
I promise.

268
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,321
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

269
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:15,243
The bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker
and her 18-year-old boyfriend
Steven Orth...

270
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:17,333
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents-

271
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:22,923
The Woodsboro double murder case.
Authorities are baffled by the lack
of clues and the savage-

272
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:26,053
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

273
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,844
although this is not the first
time this small community...

274
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,344
of Woodsboro has endured
such tragedy.

275
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:33,974
Only a year ago Maureen Prescott,
wife and mother...

276
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:38,524
was found raped and murdered not far
from this peaceful town square.

277
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,938
- Hello?
- Practise ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?

278
00:24:55,188 --> 00:24:59,278
- It's past 7:00.
- Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it till way after 10:00.

279
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:02,698
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

280
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:06,619
I'm gonna swing by the video store.
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
"All The Right Moves. "

281
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,409
You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

282
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,619
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

283
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:27,639
- Tatum, just get in the car-
- Hello, Sidney.

284
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,469
Uh, hi, who is this?

285
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,559
You tell me.

286
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:39,730
- Well, I-I have no idea.
- Scary night, isn't it?

287
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,530
With the murders and all,
it's like right out of
a horror movie or something.

288
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,740
Randy, you gave yourself away.
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

289
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,040
Do you like scary movies,
Sidney?

290
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,371
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

291
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,131
What's your favourite
scary movie?

292
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:03,051
- Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.
- Why not? Too scared?

293
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:05,931
No, no. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

294
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,971
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

295
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:11,472
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

296
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:16,062
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

297
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,942
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

298
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:22,152
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.

299
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:33,372
- So, who are you?
- The question isn't "Who am I?"

300
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,792
The question is
"Where am I?"

301
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:40,882
S- S-So, where are you?

302
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,382
Your front porch.

303
00:26:47,383 --> 00:26:49,843
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

304
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:52,473
That's the original part.

305
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:56,143
Oh, yeah?

306
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:02,734
Well, I call your bluff.

307
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:17,255
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

308
00:27:49,786 --> 00:27:54,126
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

309
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:57,126
What am I doin'? Huh?

310
00:27:57,246 --> 00:28:00,466
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

311
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:05,927
Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum
to hurry up, okay? Bye now.

312
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:08,767
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

313
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:15,557
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

314
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,067
Fuck you, you cretin!

315
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:50,888
No!

316
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,800
Shit!

317
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,771
- Billy!
- The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

318
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:43,651
The killer's here. He's in the house.
No, he's in the house.

319
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,741
He's got a knife.
He's gonna kill us.

320
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:50,411
He's gone. He's gone.
It's all right.

321
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:03,592
What?

322
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:08,262
Sid, what?

323
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:13,892
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

324
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,733
What's going on?
Sidney, come back!

325
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:18,983
Sidney!

326
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:27,403
Sorry! I found this.
Come on!

327
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,993
- All right, hold your hands together.
- Do you wish to give up your right
to remain silent?

328
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:34,334
- I didn't do anything.
- Do you wish to give up your
right to speak to an attorney...

329
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:36,414
and have them present
during questioning?

330
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,174
Ask her. She'll tell you.
Ask her.

331
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:42,554
- What do you got, Dewey?
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait, who is that?

332
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,764
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

333
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:48,514
- I didn't do it.
- Let's go.

334
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:51,304
Sheriff, wait!
Wait, listen. Call my dad.

335
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,064
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.

336
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:57,184
Sidney! Sidney!

337
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,154
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

338
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:04,284
- She'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.
- Sid!

339
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,285
Well, we're seein'
a lot of you today.

340
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:10,415
You gonna be able to come down to the
station and answer a few questions, Sid?

341
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,875
Oh, shit, Sidney! God, Sid, I'm so sorry
I was late. Are you all right?

342
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:17,295
- Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.
- It's okay.

343
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,375
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

344
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,926
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

345
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:25,886
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

346
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:29,436
- Come on, Sid.
- Oh, you won't believe this.

347
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:35,016
Creepy, huh?

348
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:45,737
- I'll be damned.
- What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!

349
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:48,247
My name isn't Jesus.

350
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:53,417
Sidney, is that you in there? Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?

351
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,497
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

352
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:59,507
- None of your damn business.
- I heard something about
a costume. Is that true?

353
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:03,337
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

354
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:05,717
Leave Sid alone.

355
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:08,677
Where's she goin'?

356
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,478
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

357
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:15,608
I know that you're about 50 pounds
overweight, but when I say "hurry"...

358
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:20,858
please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

359
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,489
- Did you find him?
- Are you sure it was the Hilton?

360
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:33,249
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.

361
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:37,799
Could he have stayed
somewhere else?

362
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,839
I don't know. I guess.

363
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:46,640
- Don't worry, Sid. We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.

364
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,810
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.

365
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,690
Hold on a minute.

366
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,780
Let me ask you this. What're you
doin' with a cellular telephone, son?

367
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,570
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

368
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,540
- I didn't make those calls, I swear.
- Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake!

369
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,580
- Call Vital Phone Comp. They got
the records of every number dialled.
- Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

370
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:20,551
- What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?
- I wanted to see her, that's all.

371
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:24,381
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

372
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:27,551
You went out last night?

373
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:31,021
I was watchin' TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

374
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,272
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

375
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:38,402
No. No, I didn't.
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody!

376
00:33:43,782 --> 00:33:46,822
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
till we get those phone records.

377
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,953
This is crazy.

378
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:56,373
You know that?
I didn't do it.

379
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,303
- Camera Two?
- Go. I do.
- Okay.

380
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,813
Are there any more
doughnuts in there?

381
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,143
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

382
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:17,273
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

383
00:34:17,393 --> 00:34:21,654
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.
- Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...

384
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:24,244
- Hey, where's she going?
- where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

385
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:27,914
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you
know who you're dealing with?
- No cameras, please.

386
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:30,914
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

387
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:33,204
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

388
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,584
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- All right, come on.

389
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:38,465
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.

390
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:40,675
Come on!

391
00:34:45,135 --> 00:34:48,885
Sid, we're gonna get you out of here,
okay? Are you okay?

392
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:54,566
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

393
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:57,946
There's no way
to track the purchase.

394
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:01,866
- What about that cellular phone bill?
- Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.

395
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,116
We won't know anything
until the morning.

396
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,996
Oh, come on!

397
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:11,076
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance. "

398
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:15,666
But these kids today,
damned if I know.

399
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:18,966
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

400
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:21,336
Goddamn it, Dewey!

401
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:25,096
What did Mama tell you?
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law!

402
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:30,387
- I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?
- Whoa.

403
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:35,107
Uh, take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

404
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:37,567
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

405
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:40,987
- He's my superior.
- The janitor is your superior.

406
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:45,368
Let's get back to work!

407
00:35:51,498 --> 00:35:56,378
- Isn't there a back way
out of this building?
- Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

408
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:04,179
You guys just stay here. I'm gonna get
the car. Don't move. Don't make a sound.

409
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:09,139
There she is. Sidney!

410
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:12,099
Hi. That was some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

411
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:15,609
- She's not answering any questions,
all right? Just leave us alone.
- No. No. Tatum. It's okay.

412
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:19,399
- She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?
- Yes, that's right.

413
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:22,659
- So, how's the book?
- Well, it'll be out later this year.

414
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:25,029
Oh, I'll look for it.

415
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:28,659
I'll send you a copy.

416
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:32,920
- Jeez. Nice shot.
- Bitch!

417
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,040
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

418
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,960
God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy. "

419
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,380
Bam! Bitch went down.

420
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:47,050
"I'll send you a copy. " Bam!
Sid- Superbitch! You are so cool.

421
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,681
Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.

422
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:51,931
Thanks.

423
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:55,271
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

424
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:57,691
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:05,702
Do you really think
Billy did it?

426
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:08,782
He was there, Tatum.

427
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:14,542
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

428
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:17,672
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

429
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:20,502
- My dad?
- I don't think so.

430
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,382
- Take a message.
- No, um, I'll get it.

431
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,722
How's she doin'?

432
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:36,772
- Hello.
- Hello, Sidney.

433
00:37:36,902 --> 00:37:40,363
- No!
- Poor Billy-boyfriend.

434
00:37:40,483 --> 00:37:44,323
- An innocent guy doesn't stand
a chance with you.
- Leave me alone!

435
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:48,323
- Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy again.
- Dewey!

436
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:51,243
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.
- Don't worry.

437
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:55,254
- You'll find out soon enough. I promise.
- Dewey!

438
00:37:57,924 --> 00:37:59,924
What?

439
00:38:01,884 --> 00:38:04,924
- What?
- What?

440
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,895
Hello.

441
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:25,365
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

442
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:29,165
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott
who was brutally killed last year...

443
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:32,085
when convicted murderer Cotton Weary
broke into their home...

444
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:35,085
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

445
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:37,925
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...

446
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:41,295
handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.

447
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:45,056
She was the key witness in
the State's case against the-

448
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:50,186
It's never gonna stop,
is it?

449
00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:52,816
Billy was released.

450
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:56,316
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

451
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:59,237
We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.

452
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:03,407
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

453
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:07,787
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

454
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:10,617
You okay?

455
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:28,558
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.

456
00:39:28,678 --> 00:39:32,058
- So how does it feel to be almost
brutally butchered?
- Hey! Hey, now leave her alone.
- Come on, Sid.

457
00:39:32,188 --> 00:39:34,688
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.
- Leave her alone.

458
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:40,398
- How does it feel?
- She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

459
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,488
What?

460
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:46,578
Just a sec.

461
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,589
- Stop right there.
- I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

462
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,679
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.

463
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:05,430
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.

464
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,970
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!

465
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:15,230
Your mother's murder was last year's
hottest court case. Somebody was gonna
write a book about it.

466
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,530
- Right. And it had to be you with
all your lies and bullshit theories.
- What is your problem?

467
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,031
You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary's
in jail. They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.

468
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:31,371
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.

469
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,621
It doesn't really matter
what I think.

470
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:37,211
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.

471
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:40,511
I think you falsely
identified him, yes.

472
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:43,681
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

473
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:46,971
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.

474
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:49,721
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

475
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:52,271
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

476
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:57,482
He raped her, and then he- he butchered
her. Her blood was all over his coat.

477
00:40:57,612 --> 00:41:02,282
He was drunk that night.
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

478
00:41:02,402 --> 00:41:07,242
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.

479
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:13,123
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

480
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:17,463
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

481
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:22,843
You're not so sure
any more, are you?

482
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:26,554
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.

483
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,644
- The killer's still
on the loose, isn't he?
- Come on, Sid.

484
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:33,564
- Those murders are related.
- I'm sorry I mangled your face.

485
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:37,064
- Wait, Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

486
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:46,664
Jesus Christ!
An innocent man on death row.

487
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:49,454
- A killer still on the loose.
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?

488
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:52,334
No, no, no. Not so fast.
We don't have anything concrete.

489
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:57,124
- This is huge. You can't just sit on it.
- I know! That's why we need proof.

490
00:41:57,254 --> 00:42:01,255
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

491
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,675
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

492
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:08,265
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

493
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:11,895
I want you to meet me right
here after class, okay, Sid?

494
00:42:12,015 --> 00:42:14,485
All right.

495
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:18,696
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

496
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:21,026
Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?

497
00:42:21,156 --> 00:42:24,406
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

498
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:34,757
Why are they doing this?

499
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:38,007
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

500
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:40,547
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

501
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:43,307
Sidney!

502
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,927
- Ow!
- Jesus! Shit!

503
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:48,887
It's just me.

504
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:51,897
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

505
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:54,357
No. No, I-I don't.

506
00:42:54,477 --> 00:42:58,147
- It's just somebody was there.
- Hey, Christy, wait up!

507
00:42:58,277 --> 00:43:00,697
- Billy, someone-
someone tried to kill me.
- I know. I know. I know.

508
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:05,078
The cops said I scared him away.
It wasn't me, Sid.

509
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:08,498
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

510
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:13,378
You see? It couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?

511
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:18,968
I'm so sorry.
Please understand.

512
00:43:19,088 --> 00:43:22,849
Understand what? That I have a
girlfriend who would rather accuse me...

513
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,599
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

514
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:29,939
- You know that's not true.
- Then what is it?

515
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:34,519
What is it? Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

516
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:36,650
I mean between us.

517
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,320
You haven't been
the same since-

518
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,370
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?

519
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,240
My mom was killed. I can't believe
you're bringing this up!

520
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,080
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

521
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,670
I know. I think it's time
you got over that. I mean,
when my mom left my dad, I accepted it.

522
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,880
It's the way it is.
She's not comin' back.

523
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,050
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

524
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,550
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

525
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,390
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's- It's a bad analogy.

526
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,521
But it's just that...

527
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:12,601
I want my girlfriend back.

528
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:18,611
- Sid!
- Billy, I am sorry
if my traumatized life...

529
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:21,861
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

530
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:25,071
What? What are you-
Nobody said that. Sid!

531
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:31,082
- Stupid.
- You make me so sick!

532
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:36,422
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

533
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:41,923
So, two of your fellow students
just savagely murdered...

534
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:45,263
and this is the way that you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

535
00:44:45,393 --> 00:44:49,013
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!

536
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:52,023
Oh, come on, Mr Himbry!
It was just a joke.

537
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:54,353
Yeah, that's not fair!

538
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,193
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.

539
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,573
Fairness would be to rip your
insides out, hang you from a tree...

540
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:07,873
so we can expose you for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

541
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,014
- She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.
- Why would she lie about it?

542
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:27,554
For attention!
The girl has some serious issues.

543
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:37,985
What if she did it? What if
Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

544
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:40,075
And why would she do that?

545
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,535
Maybe she had the hots for Steve and
killed them both in a jealous rage.

546
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:49,076
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt
boyfriend, Billy.

547
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:51,996
Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.

548
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:55,546
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

549
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:59,296
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.

550
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,676
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

551
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:04,346
Her mother's death
leaves her disturbed and hostile.

552
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:07,976
In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.

553
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:11,016
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.

554
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,856
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

555
00:46:13,976 --> 00:46:17,276
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

556
00:46:17,396 --> 00:46:21,367
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

557
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,997
- Where do you get this shit?
- "Ricki Lake. "

558
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:27,577
You are pathetic.

559
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,968
Pathetic.

560
00:46:43,098 --> 00:46:45,218
Sidney.

561
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,249
Sidney.

562
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:20,679
Is someone there?

563
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:03,182
In what appears to be a prank, several
students were seen wearing scary masks.

564
00:48:03,302 --> 00:48:05,512
School officials
have yet to comment...

565
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:09,312
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

566
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:14,362
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth
have already lost their lives.

567
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:19,282
Who's next? You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

568
00:48:19,402 --> 00:48:22,702
Hi. Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story. "

569
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:25,992
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?

570
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:28,742
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

571
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,913
No, everything's under control.

572
00:48:31,043 --> 00:48:34,463
- Well, of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.

573
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:39,883
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker,
but who knew?

574
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:44,803
- You look awfully young
to be a police officer.
- I'm 25 years old.

575
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:50,474
You know, in a demographic study
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

576
00:48:50,604 --> 00:48:54,774
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

577
00:48:54,904 --> 00:48:59,154
Except in that upper torso area.
Does the force require you to work out?

578
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:02,905
No, ma'am.
Because of my boyish good looks...

579
00:49:03,035 --> 00:49:07,205
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

580
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:11,295
I need your attention now, kids. Due to
the recent events that have occurred...

581
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:16,585
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

582
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:20,135
The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

583
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:23,555
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

584
00:49:23,675 --> 00:49:25,895
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

585
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,355
Well, serial killer's
not really accurate.

586
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:30,815
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

587
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,935
Well, we can hope,
can't we?

588
00:49:34,065 --> 00:49:36,356
I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.

589
00:49:36,486 --> 00:49:40,276
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

590
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:45,656
- Well, he's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out
as a possibility.

591
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:49,246
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

592
00:49:49,376 --> 00:49:53,417
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

593
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:56,677
you are much prettier in person.

594
00:49:56,797 --> 00:49:58,927
So you do watch the show.

595
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:05,677
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.

596
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:09,058
Please, call me Gale!

597
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,478
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

598
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,648
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

599
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:18,028
Well, you're not to be alone any more.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

600
00:50:18,158 --> 00:50:20,448
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out. "

601
00:50:20,568 --> 00:50:24,868
I don't know what you did, Sidney,
but on behalf of the entire student
body, we all say, "Thank you!"

602
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:27,538
- Drop it, Stu.
- No, I say...

603
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:30,078
an impromptu party tonight,
my house.

604
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:34,258
- Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?
- Are you serious?

605
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:38,678
As long as this little vixen doesn't
invite the entire world, we'll be fine.

606
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:40,969
Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.

607
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:44,809
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks?

608
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:48,439
I will totally protect you. Yo,
I am so buff. I got you covered, girl.

609
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,439
- No.
- Come on, Sid. For me?

610
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:54,979
It could be fun.

611
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:58,820
- Okay. Whatever.
- Yeah? Nice.

612
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,740
Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?

613
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:20,881
Yes?

614
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,971
Hello?

615
00:51:57,762 --> 00:52:01,342
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?

616
00:52:01,472 --> 00:52:04,263
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

617
00:53:05,175 --> 00:53:09,306
School's out for summer

618
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:14,476
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?

619
00:53:14,596 --> 00:53:18,106
- With fever
- Maybe he was having
an affair with your mom.

620
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:21,816
- I mean, your dad was always
out of town on business. Maybe-
- School's out

621
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:25,237
- Completely
- Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

622
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:29,407
If- If they were having
an affair, then how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

623
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:34,327
Well, you can't prove a rumour.
That's why it's a rumour.

624
00:53:34,457 --> 00:53:38,457
Right. Created by that little
tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

625
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:45,427
It goes further back, Sid.
There's been talk about other men.

626
00:53:45,547 --> 00:53:47,967
And you believe it.

627
00:53:48,097 --> 00:53:53,517
Well, I mean,
you can only hear that Richard Gere
gerbil story so many times...

628
00:53:53,637 --> 00:53:56,858
before you have to start
believing it.

629
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:03,238
Oh, I'm sorry.

630
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:10,738
You know, if-if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary, then
the killer's still out there.

631
00:54:10,868 --> 00:54:15,169
Don't go there, Sid.
You're starting to sound like
some Wes Carpenter flick or something.

632
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:19,499
Don't freak yourself out, okay? We've
got a long night ahead of us. Okay?

633
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,259
Let's boogie.

634
00:54:26,759 --> 00:54:29,349
- It's alive!
- Henry!

635
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:32,430
Oh, in the name of God,
now I know-

636
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,520
Excuse me, dude.

637
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,480
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

638
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,860
Dork.

639
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,740
Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.

640
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,160
- We had a run
in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?

641
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,160
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know.
- Cool.

642
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,710
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

643
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,880
- "The Howling. " Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

644
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,801
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

645
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:09,051
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

646
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,601
would you be standing
in the horror section?

647
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:16,061
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

648
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:20,312
You're such a little lapdog. He's got
"killer" printed all over his forehead.

649
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:25,362
Okay! Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?

650
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:29,532
Because obviously
they don't watch enough movies.
This is standard horror movie stuff.

651
00:55:29,662 --> 00:55:34,242
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?

652
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,373
There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

653
00:55:37,503 --> 00:55:41,003
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all:
simplicity.

654
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:44,753
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

655
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,383
Well, what's his reason?

656
00:55:47,513 --> 00:55:50,593
Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.

657
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,973
- What, is she savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

658
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:57,733
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

659
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,613
No, I don't at all. No.

660
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:09,114
You know who I think it is?

661
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:11,744
You know, I think
it's her father.

662
00:56:11,874 --> 00:56:14,244
Why can't they find
her pops, man?

663
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:17,254
Because he's probably dead.

664
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,084
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

665
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:23,885
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

666
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,385
- See, the police are always
off track with this shit.
- Man!

667
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:28,635
If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.

668
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:33,345
There's a formula to it. A very simple
formula! Everybody's a suspect!

669
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:43,616
I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.

670
00:56:43,736 --> 00:56:48,196
How do we know you're
not the killer? Huh? Huh?

671
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:52,666
- Hi, Billy.
- Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button. You ever think of that?

672
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:54,956
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

673
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:58,666
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.

674
00:56:58,796 --> 00:57:01,376
And what would be
your motive?

675
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:05,386
It's the millennium.
Motives are incidental.

676
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,596
"Millennium. "

677
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:11,846
"Millennium. " I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.

678
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:16,307
Good kid.

679
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:19,107
"Millennium. "
Good word, my man.

680
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,187
Are you telling me
that's not a killer?

681
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:26,697
You'll see him
in your nightmares

682
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:29,538
You'll see him
in your dreams

683
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:35,378
He'll appear
out of nowhere

684
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:37,628
But he ain't

685
00:57:37,748 --> 00:57:40,798
What he seems

686
00:57:40,918 --> 00:57:43,008
You'll see him in your head

687
00:57:43,128 --> 00:57:45,258
On the TV screen

688
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:48,929
Hey, buddy
I'm warnin' you to turn it off

689
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:51,349
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god

690
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:54,849
He's a man
He's a guru

691
00:57:56,349 --> 00:58:00,859
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

692
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:06,029
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

693
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,369
Sure is quiet.

694
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,579
God, look at this place.
It's "The Town That Dreaded Sundown. "

695
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:16,829
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

696
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,460
Hey, Sid, just think. If they make a
movie about you, who's gonna play you?

697
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:24,470
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

698
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:28,090
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

699
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,970
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

700
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,060
You girls don't go too far.

701
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:38,151
- Is Billy gonna be there tonight?
- He better not be.

702
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:43,191
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

703
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:48,531
Billy's right, you know. Whenever
he touches me, I just can't relax.

704
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:52,372
So you have a few intimacy issues as a
result of your mother's untimely death.

705
00:58:52,492 --> 00:58:54,792
It's no big deal, Sid.
I mean, you'll thaw out.

706
00:58:54,912 --> 00:58:58,172
Yeah, but he has been so patient with
me, you know, with all the sex stuff.

707
00:58:58,292 --> 00:59:02,172
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

708
00:59:02,302 --> 00:59:05,552
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

709
00:59:14,392 --> 00:59:18,442
- Dewey, where the hell you been?
- I was keepin' an eye on Sidney, uh-

710
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:24,483
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it-

711
00:59:24,613 --> 00:59:28,573
Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.

712
00:59:28,703 --> 00:59:32,783
Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

713
00:59:32,913 --> 00:59:37,213
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

714
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:40,214
There's no way a cellular
could've been cloned?

715
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:43,254
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

716
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:46,214
The anniversary
of his wife's death.

717
00:59:48,634 --> 00:59:51,304
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

718
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:54,854
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

719
00:59:56,315 --> 00:59:59,945
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?

720
01:00:00,065 --> 01:00:03,065
No. Not just yet.

721
01:00:03,195 --> 01:00:07,115
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

722
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:19,165
You stay close to Sidney.
Don't let her out of your sight.

723
01:00:19,295 --> 01:00:22,005
Yes, sir.

724
01:00:41,486 --> 01:00:44,866
Say a prayer
for the youth of America

725
01:00:48,197 --> 01:00:51,407
God bless the youth
of America

726
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,747
And I can't stand
their sight any more

727
01:00:56,877 --> 01:00:59,087
All right,
you girls have fun.

728
01:00:59,207 --> 01:01:01,928
Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.

729
01:01:03,428 --> 01:01:06,098
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

730
01:01:07,348 --> 01:01:13,478
You're obsessed

731
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:18,268
You're obsessed

732
01:01:18,398 --> 01:01:20,358
Here, kids!

733
01:01:22,898 --> 01:01:26,778
- Oh, that's mature.
- You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.

734
01:01:26,908 --> 01:01:29,238
My man!

735
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:52,060
- Well, were we spotted?
- I don't think so. Go get the camera.

736
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,600
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare ya.

737
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:00,820
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?

738
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:05,160
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

739
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,581
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

740
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:12,371
Then what are you
doing here?

741
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,371
Just keepin' an eye
on things.

742
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:19,381
I'm gonna check the party out.

743
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:23,921
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

744
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:27,261
All right.
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.

745
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:36,101
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

746
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:38,191
Oh! Yeah.

747
01:02:39,652 --> 01:02:42,532
- How many "Evil Deads?"
- One!
- Two!

748
01:02:42,652 --> 01:02:45,282
- How many "Hellraisers?"
- Hellraiser right here.

749
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:48,412
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night. "

750
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:51,912
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

751
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:54,502
She's the scream queen.

752
01:02:54,622 --> 01:02:57,753
- With a set of lungs like that,
she should be.
- Yeah.

753
01:02:57,873 --> 01:03:01,423
- Tits. See?
- Oh, I'll get it.

754
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:07,383
- Hey, Tate, grab me
another beer, would ya?
- There's more beer in the garage.

755
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:11,263
- What am I, the beer wench?
- She was nominated-

756
01:03:11,393 --> 01:03:14,274
- She was nominated for "Terror Train. "
- You're not gonna believe who's here!

757
01:03:14,394 --> 01:03:17,644
- It's that chick from "Top Story!"
- Gale Weathers?
- Here!

758
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:20,734
- Shit!
- You're under age, son.

759
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:25,364
I'm kiddin'. Have a good time.
Watch the drivin'.

760
01:03:25,494 --> 01:03:27,574
- Dewey.
- Hi.

761
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:29,744
Dewey.

762
01:03:29,864 --> 01:03:32,914
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me.

763
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:36,044
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

764
01:03:36,164 --> 01:03:39,624
Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.

765
01:03:41,424 --> 01:03:44,004
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

766
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:46,095
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

767
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:48,555
- Hey.
- Hey.

768
01:03:48,685 --> 01:03:51,555
I need a camera.

769
01:03:51,685 --> 01:03:54,565
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

770
01:03:56,395 --> 01:03:58,445
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

771
01:04:00,945 --> 01:04:04,366
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one I want.

772
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:07,906
Too bad, I've spoken

773
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:10,576
When I look at you
you're forgiven

774
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:30,097
You're forgiven

775
01:04:49,697 --> 01:04:51,658
Jesus!

776
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:56,588
Tatum, it's okay.

777
01:05:05,888 --> 01:05:08,309
Shit.

778
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:13,769
Hey, shitheads!

779
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:17,269
Hello!

780
01:05:18,569 --> 01:05:21,529
Shit. Piss.

781
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:42,920
Is that you, Randy?

782
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:46,430
Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage?"

783
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:51,390
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

784
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,390
Oh, you wanna play
psycho killer?

785
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,111
Can I be
the helpless victim?

786
01:05:57,231 --> 01:06:01,031
Okay, let's see- No, please
don't kill me, Mr Ghost Face.

787
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:03,651
I wanna be in the sequel!

788
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:08,281
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.

789
01:06:10,161 --> 01:06:12,502
Randy, what the hell
are you doing?

790
01:06:12,537 --> 01:06:13,582
Stop!

791
01:06:27,552 --> 01:06:30,143
Fucker!

792
01:07:09,074 --> 01:07:12,074
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

793
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:15,084
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here but us chickens!

794
01:07:15,204 --> 01:07:18,125
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

795
01:07:20,175 --> 01:07:22,715
Oh. Billy. Hey.

796
01:07:22,845 --> 01:07:25,845
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

797
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:28,265
I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.

798
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:30,805
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

799
01:07:30,935 --> 01:07:33,265
I tell you what. Why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

800
01:07:33,395 --> 01:07:38,276
You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.

801
01:07:38,396 --> 01:07:41,606
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

802
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:43,946
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

803
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:58,006
- What's Leatherface doin' here?
- Cute. He came to make up.

804
01:07:58,126 --> 01:08:01,006
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

805
01:08:01,126 --> 01:08:03,176
As if.
That's all I'm sayin'.

806
01:08:03,296 --> 01:08:05,256
As if.

807
01:08:05,386 --> 01:08:08,177
Oh, really, Alicia?

808
01:08:08,307 --> 01:08:11,137
"As if. "
I'm gonna go check on them.

809
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:15,017
- Come on!
- Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.

810
01:08:15,147 --> 01:08:17,437
- Thank you.
- Stick around.

811
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:19,777
You're a genius.

812
01:08:19,897 --> 01:08:22,658
- Oh, shit.
- What?

813
01:08:22,778 --> 01:08:24,948
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

814
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:28,118
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

815
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,288
- It'll be fine. Just record it.
- All right.

816
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:33,618
Oh, the placement is perfect.
Tell me, Kenneth-

817
01:08:33,748 --> 01:08:37,128
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

818
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:41,379
- Well, first time for everything.
- You're damn right.

819
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:49,969
S- So, um-

820
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:54,649
So-

821
01:08:56,939 --> 01:08:59,899
Look, I'm sorry.

822
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:04,199
I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.

823
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,159
No, Billy, I-I'm...

824
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:10,789
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

825
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:13,330
with all this
post-traumatic stress.

826
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,630
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

827
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,710
Enough is enough.
I-

828
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,010
I can't wallow in-in
the grief process forever...

829
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:26,090
and-

830
01:09:28,181 --> 01:09:33,811
and I can't keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

831
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:40,441
Yeah, I think I'm really...

832
01:09:41,981 --> 01:09:44,202
scared...

833
01:09:44,322 --> 01:09:47,622
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

834
01:09:48,912 --> 01:09:52,372
Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.

835
01:09:52,502 --> 01:09:55,372
And I know-
I know it doesn't make sense.

836
01:09:56,582 --> 01:09:58,542
Yeah, it does.

837
01:10:02,462 --> 01:10:05,842
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...

838
01:10:05,972 --> 01:10:09,852
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

839
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:14,022
But this is life.
This isn't a movie.

840
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:16,522
Sure it is, Sid.

841
01:10:16,642 --> 01:10:18,603
It's all-
It's all a movie.

842
01:10:18,733 --> 01:10:20,693
It's all...

843
01:10:20,823 --> 01:10:22,783
one great big movie.

844
01:10:29,203 --> 01:10:31,583
Only you can't pick
your genre.

845
01:10:58,145 --> 01:11:00,615
Why can't I be
a Meg Ryan movie?

846
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:06,615
Or even a good porno.

847
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:13,125
- What?
- You heard me.

848
01:11:21,965 --> 01:11:24,096
Are you sure?

849
01:11:25,306 --> 01:11:27,386
Yeah.

850
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:30,346
I think so.

851
01:11:45,787 --> 01:11:47,997
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

852
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:51,707
Oh, man.
The colour of the blood is all wrong!

853
01:11:51,827 --> 01:11:54,377
Why do they do that?
It's too red!

854
01:11:54,497 --> 01:11:57,878
Wait. Here comes another.
Here it- Here it-

855
01:11:58,008 --> 01:11:59,968
- Ooh!
- Yes! Yes!

856
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:02,338
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

857
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:04,798
How can you watch this shit
over and over?

858
01:12:04,928 --> 01:12:07,518
When do we see breasts?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.

859
01:12:07,638 --> 01:12:10,348
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Yes. Yes.
- Breasts?

860
01:12:10,478 --> 01:12:12,808
Not until "Trading Places"
in '83.

861
01:12:12,938 --> 01:12:15,308
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

862
01:12:15,438 --> 01:12:17,648
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

863
01:12:17,778 --> 01:12:20,948
- Could afford a decent pair.
- What did you-

864
01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:23,948
That's why she always
outsmarted the killer in
the big chase scene at the end.

865
01:12:24,068 --> 01:12:26,408
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

866
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:28,949
- What rules?
- You don-

867
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:33,669
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

868
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:35,789
Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?

869
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:38,549
There are certain rules
that one must abide by...

870
01:12:38,669 --> 01:12:41,129
in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.

871
01:12:41,259 --> 01:12:44,840
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

872
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,060
- Big no-no! Big no-no!
- I'd be a dead man.

873
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,140
- Sex equals death. Okay?
- Yes!

874
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:56,230
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

875
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,071
No, the sin factor.

876
01:13:01,191 --> 01:13:03,491
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

877
01:13:03,611 --> 01:13:06,371
And number three:
Never, ever, ever...

878
01:13:06,491 --> 01:13:09,871
under any circumstances say,
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

879
01:13:09,991 --> 01:13:12,711
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

880
01:13:12,831 --> 01:13:15,211
I'll be right back!

881
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:19,341
You see? You push the laws
and you end up dead.

882
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,421
Okay? I'll see you
in the kitchen with a knife.

883
01:13:21,551 --> 01:13:24,931
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

884
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,471
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

885
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:30,101
You don't know the rules?
There are certain rules...

886
01:13:30,221 --> 01:13:33,732
- that one must abide by in order
to essentially survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

887
01:13:33,852 --> 01:13:38,942
- For instance-
- The sheriff just radioed.

888
01:13:39,072 --> 01:13:42,692
Somebody reported a car
in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.

889
01:13:42,822 --> 01:13:46,202
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

890
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:48,742
If you're sure
it's all right.

891
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:51,793
Ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.

892
01:13:54,043 --> 01:13:56,293
Be right back.

893
01:13:58,793 --> 01:14:00,963
You see, you push the laws
and you end up dead.

894
01:14:01,093 --> 01:14:03,973
- W- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

895
01:14:04,093 --> 01:14:06,054
I thought maybe we'd walk.

896
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:11,064
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

897
01:14:14,234 --> 01:14:17,654
- You're not scared, are ya?
- No.

898
01:14:17,774 --> 01:14:20,234
- All right.
- Great.

899
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:26,324
Do you know what
that constellation is?

900
01:14:26,454 --> 01:14:28,534
No. What is it?

901
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:31,834
I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.

902
01:14:35,454 --> 01:14:38,215
- What happened to Tatum, Stu?
- She probably got pissed
at me and bailed.

903
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:40,295
- Bye.
- Bye.

904
01:14:41,755 --> 01:14:43,965
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

905
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:03,526
Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!

906
01:15:07,246 --> 01:15:09,206
- Yes! Oh! That was beautiful!
- Lovely!

907
01:15:11,247 --> 01:15:13,877
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

908
01:15:14,997 --> 01:15:16,957
You are so...

909
01:15:18,507 --> 01:15:20,467
amazing.

910
01:15:26,307 --> 01:15:29,307
Hello? Yeah?

911
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:35,647
Holy shit.

912
01:15:37,187 --> 01:15:41,027
N- Ho-
Listen up.

913
01:15:41,157 --> 01:15:43,932
They found
Principal Himbry dead.

914
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:46,708
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!

915
01:15:46,838 --> 01:15:49,708
- Where did he say he was?
- Where are you guys-
Where are you guys-
- At the football field!

916
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:54,218
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?

917
01:15:54,338 --> 01:15:56,508
We were just gettin'
to the good part.

918
01:15:56,638 --> 01:16:00,059
Hello? Yeah?

919
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:09,979
Where are you guys-

920
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,210
Heigh-ho, Silver!
Let's go!

921
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:30,590
- So, is- is Dewey your real name?
- No, it's Dwight.

922
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,210
Dwight?

923
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,930
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

924
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,760
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

925
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,850
Well, I like it.

926
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:43,270
It's sexy.

927
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:46,020
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

928
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,521
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

929
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,031
What about Gale Weathers?

930
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:55,201
Sounds like I'm
a meteorologist or something.

931
01:16:56,611 --> 01:17:01,661
People treat me like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

932
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:04,251
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?
- No.

933
01:17:04,371 --> 01:17:06,832
I think that's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

934
01:17:06,962 --> 01:17:09,672
They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

935
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,752
Freeze! Jump!

936
01:17:15,552 --> 01:17:19,432
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

937
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:33,903
I'm sorry.
I'm on duty.

938
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:45,543
Is that what
you're looking for?

939
01:17:45,663 --> 01:17:47,623
My whole life.

940
01:17:52,503 --> 01:17:55,014
- Damn!
- What?

941
01:17:55,134 --> 01:17:57,094
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

942
01:17:57,224 --> 01:17:59,394
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

943
01:18:00,934 --> 01:18:02,894
Jesus.
What's he doing here?

944
01:18:04,564 --> 01:18:06,524
We gotta get back.

945
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:12,065
You okay?

946
01:18:13,575 --> 01:18:15,535
Yeah.

947
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,615
Yeah, I'm fine.

948
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:31,886
- Who'd you call?
- What?

949
01:18:32,006 --> 01:18:35,636
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested
you're allowed one phone call.

950
01:18:35,756 --> 01:18:38,346
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

951
01:18:40,386 --> 01:18:42,346
Called my dad.

952
01:18:44,476 --> 01:18:48,026
No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.

953
01:18:50,816 --> 01:18:54,236
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

954
01:19:05,457 --> 01:19:08,457
You don't still think
it was me, do you?

955
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:14,757
No.

956
01:19:14,887 --> 01:19:17,008
No. I was just thinking...

957
01:19:17,138 --> 01:19:20,848
if it were you it'd be a very
clever way to throw me off track.

958
01:19:20,978 --> 01:19:26,898
You know, using your one phone call
to call me so that I wouldn't
think it was you, that's all.

959
01:19:27,018 --> 01:19:29,108
Really.

960
01:19:35,949 --> 01:19:40,449
What do I have to do to prove
to you that I'm not a killer?

961
01:19:41,999 --> 01:19:44,629
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

962
01:19:46,419 --> 01:19:49,209
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney-
- Billy, watch out!

963
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:57,769
Sid.

964
01:20:29,151 --> 01:20:31,111
Shit!

965
01:20:36,441 --> 01:20:39,112
Help me, somebody!
Help me!

966
01:20:57,382 --> 01:21:00,012
Help me!

967
01:21:29,544 --> 01:21:34,344
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.

968
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,674
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.

969
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:39,724
You- You know-
Look-

970
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:42,264
Look, there he is.
I told you.

971
01:21:42,394 --> 01:21:45,015
I told you he was
right around the corner.

972
01:21:45,145 --> 01:21:47,105
Jamie. Jamie.

973
01:21:48,565 --> 01:21:52,235
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.

974
01:21:52,355 --> 01:21:54,905
Turn around.
Behind you.

975
01:21:55,025 --> 01:21:59,325
All the time!
Behind you!

976
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:01,915
Behind you, Jamie.

977
01:22:02,035 --> 01:22:05,915
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.

978
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:08,755
Help me! Help!

979
01:22:20,806 --> 01:22:23,846
Let me in!

980
01:22:23,976 --> 01:22:26,816
- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.

981
01:22:26,936 --> 01:22:31,066
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

982
01:22:31,186 --> 01:22:33,947
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.

983
01:22:34,067 --> 01:22:37,987
- Jamie. Jamie.
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

984
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:40,867
- Behind ya!
- Look around!

985
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:46,167
- Shit.
- What?
- We're on 30-second delay.

986
01:22:46,287 --> 01:22:48,798
Oh, my God.

987
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:44,430
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

988
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,060
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

989
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,570
Be careful!

990
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:06,661
Neil?

991
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:14,091
Mr Prescott?

992
01:24:16,221 --> 01:24:18,181
Shit!

993
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,112
Kenny, I need the cellular!

994
01:24:40,072 --> 01:24:42,703
Kenny!

995
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,793
Kenny!

996
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:12,774
- 9-1-1.
- What's going on?

997
01:25:25,294 --> 01:25:27,164
Oh, God!

998
01:25:40,345 --> 01:25:42,385
Stop!

999
01:25:50,606 --> 01:25:52,566
Oh, God!

1000
01:26:02,076 --> 01:26:04,407
Dewey!

1001
01:26:04,537 --> 01:26:06,497
Dewey, where are you?

1002
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:11,537
Dewey!

1003
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,207
Sidney?

1004
01:26:18,087 --> 01:26:20,347
Dewey!

1005
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:50,378
Shit!

1006
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:19,570
7825, suspect at
105 North Avenue 52.

1007
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,530
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

1008
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:26,950
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's gonna try and kill me.

1009
01:27:49,521 --> 01:27:52,691
Sidney!
Sidney!

1010
01:27:52,811 --> 01:27:55,191
Jesus, we've got to get
the fuck out of here!

1011
01:27:55,321 --> 01:27:58,572
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.

1012
01:27:58,692 --> 01:28:01,702
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!
- Stay back!

1013
01:28:01,822 --> 01:28:04,572
- Stu did it. He killed Billy!
He killed my Tatum!
- You did it!

1014
01:28:04,702 --> 01:28:07,492
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!

1015
01:28:07,622 --> 01:28:11,252
Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!
Give me that gun! Christ, man!

1016
01:28:11,372 --> 01:28:14,502
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!

1017
01:28:14,633 --> 01:28:18,093
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1018
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:20,723
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

1019
01:28:20,843 --> 01:28:24,343
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

1020
01:28:24,473 --> 01:28:27,723
- Open up!
- He did it!

1021
01:28:27,853 --> 01:28:30,933
Help me!
He's going crazy!

1022
01:28:31,063 --> 01:28:33,063
- Sidney!
- Go away!

1023
01:28:33,193 --> 01:28:35,443
Sidney?

1024
01:28:35,563 --> 01:28:37,523
Leave me alone.

1025
01:28:43,153 --> 01:28:45,623
- Sid.
- Billy.

1026
01:28:51,794 --> 01:28:53,834
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?

1027
01:28:53,964 --> 01:28:56,754
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

1028
01:28:56,884 --> 01:28:59,634
No, I'm like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.

1029
01:28:59,754 --> 01:29:01,804
- Get up.
- Help me.

1030
01:29:01,924 --> 01:29:04,935
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

1031
01:29:05,055 --> 01:29:07,645
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.
- No, he's out there.

1032
01:29:07,765 --> 01:29:10,315
No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.

1033
01:29:10,435 --> 01:29:12,525
It's okay. It's okay.

1034
01:29:12,645 --> 01:29:14,605
Careful.

1035
01:29:15,985 --> 01:29:18,405
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!

1036
01:29:18,525 --> 01:29:20,696
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!

1037
01:29:23,156 --> 01:29:25,286
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

1038
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:27,826
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1039
01:29:34,376 --> 01:29:36,586
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho. "

1040
01:29:43,556 --> 01:29:47,306
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in "Carrie. "

1041
01:29:51,566 --> 01:29:54,067
Stu.
Help me, please.

1042
01:29:56,817 --> 01:29:59,777
Surprise, Sidney.

1043
01:30:03,037 --> 01:30:05,617
- No!
- Ooh!

1044
01:30:05,747 --> 01:30:08,367
Oh, now. Whoa.

1045
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:15,008
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1046
01:30:15,128 --> 01:30:18,378
- Why are you doing this?
- It's all part of the game, Sidney.

1047
01:30:18,508 --> 01:30:21,218
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die. "
- Fuck you!

1048
01:30:21,348 --> 01:30:25,889
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?

1049
01:30:26,019 --> 01:30:29,059
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.

1050
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:32,109
See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong...

1051
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:34,359
"boo-kah," you die!

1052
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:37,489
You get it right,
you die.

1053
01:30:37,609 --> 01:30:41,159
- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer
the term "psychotic. "

1054
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,159
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?

1055
01:30:46,289 --> 01:30:48,459
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1056
01:30:48,579 --> 01:30:51,249
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1057
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:55,259
Watch a few movies,
take a few notes.

1058
01:30:55,379 --> 01:30:57,669
- It was fun.
- No!

1059
01:30:57,799 --> 01:31:01,180
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?

1060
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:05,390
Why? Why did you kill my mother?

1061
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,980
Why? Why?

1062
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:14,110
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1063
01:31:14,231 --> 01:31:17,321
Well, I don't really believe
in motive, Sid. I mean,
did Norman Bates have a motive?

1064
01:31:17,441 --> 01:31:20,571
- No.
- Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

1065
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:26,121
Don't think so! See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1066
01:31:26,241 --> 01:31:29,211
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slut-bag whore...

1067
01:31:29,331 --> 01:31:32,292
who flashed her shit all over town like
she was Sharon Stone or something.

1068
01:31:32,422 --> 01:31:34,632
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney...

1069
01:31:34,752 --> 01:31:38,132
your mother
was no Sharon Stone, hmm?

1070
01:31:43,392 --> 01:31:45,812
Is that motive enough
for you?

1071
01:31:48,182 --> 01:31:50,982
Well, how about this?

1072
01:31:51,102 --> 01:31:54,812
Your slut mother
was fucking my father...

1073
01:31:56,732 --> 01:32:00,322
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1074
01:32:02,492 --> 01:32:05,703
How's that for a motive?

1075
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:07,913
Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behaviour.

1076
01:32:08,043 --> 01:32:11,463
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1077
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:15,923
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin.

1078
01:32:16,043 --> 01:32:18,003
I said "virgin. "
Whoops!

1079
01:32:18,133 --> 01:32:21,014
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.

1080
01:32:21,134 --> 01:32:25,264
Let's pretend it's all a scary movie,
Sid. How do you think it's gonna end?

1081
01:32:28,854 --> 01:32:32,144
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1082
01:32:32,274 --> 01:32:34,694
We got a surprise
for you, Sidney.

1083
01:32:34,814 --> 01:32:37,655
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1084
01:32:37,775 --> 01:32:41,615
Hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.

1085
01:32:41,745 --> 01:32:43,705
You know what time
it is, Sid?

1086
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:45,785
It's after midnight.

1087
01:32:45,915 --> 01:32:49,545
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.

1088
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:52,965
We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1089
01:32:53,085 --> 01:32:57,045
Attention! Oh, what do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1090
01:32:57,175 --> 01:33:01,345
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it. That's enough.

1091
01:33:01,465 --> 01:33:04,015
Guess we won't be needing
this any more, huh?

1092
01:33:04,135 --> 01:33:07,355
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

1093
01:33:07,475 --> 01:33:09,516
- Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?
- Come on, Sidney.

1094
01:33:09,646 --> 01:33:14,446
You think about it now, huh?
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1095
01:33:14,566 --> 01:33:17,446
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?

1096
01:33:17,566 --> 01:33:21,196
Your mother's anniversary
set him off, and he went on
a murder spree, killing everyone.

1097
01:33:21,326 --> 01:33:23,536
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1098
01:33:23,656 --> 01:33:26,747
Then he kills you...

1099
01:33:26,877 --> 01:33:29,457
and shoots himself
in the head.

1100
01:33:29,587 --> 01:33:33,167
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

1101
01:33:33,297 --> 01:33:35,257
Watch this.

1102
01:33:39,257 --> 01:33:43,428
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

1103
01:33:43,558 --> 01:33:47,558
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!

1104
01:33:52,438 --> 01:33:54,938
Good one, man. Jesus.

1105
01:33:55,068 --> 01:33:59,028
Oh, shit.
My turn.

1106
01:34:01,658 --> 01:34:04,198
Don't forget. Stay to the side
and don't go too deep.

1107
01:34:05,868 --> 01:34:07,918
Okay. I'll remember.

1108
01:34:09,038 --> 01:34:12,418
Fuck! Fuck!

1109
01:34:12,548 --> 01:34:14,959
Fuck!
Goddamn it, Stu!

1110
01:34:15,089 --> 01:34:19,219
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got
a little too zealous, huh?

1111
01:34:19,339 --> 01:34:22,259
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1112
01:34:22,389 --> 01:34:25,479
Give me the knife!

1113
01:34:27,019 --> 01:34:29,979
Now!

1114
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:35,940
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.

1115
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,660
We get to carry on
and plan the sequel...

1116
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:42,950
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days ya gotta have a sequel!

1117
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:48,581
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1118
01:34:48,711 --> 01:34:51,171
Now, Sid, don't you
blame the movies.

1119
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:53,101
Movies don't create psychos.

1120
01:34:53,136 --> 01:34:54,911
I feel a little woozy here!

1121
01:34:57,711 --> 01:35:02,421
All right.
All right, you get the gun.

1122
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:04,631
And I'll untie Pops, okay?

1123
01:35:07,051 --> 01:35:10,181
- Now!
- Okay.

1124
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:25,612
Houston, we-
we have a problem here.

1125
01:35:27,652 --> 01:35:30,202
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

1126
01:35:30,322 --> 01:35:33,872
I put it right there,
and it's not there.

1127
01:35:33,992 --> 01:35:37,203
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.

1128
01:35:39,673 --> 01:35:42,293
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.

1129
01:35:42,423 --> 01:35:45,133
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.

1130
01:35:45,253 --> 01:35:48,223
The reporter left for dead
in the news van...

1131
01:35:48,343 --> 01:35:50,343
comes to...

1132
01:35:50,473 --> 01:35:54,974
stumbles on you two dipshits,
finds the gun...

1133
01:35:55,104 --> 01:35:59,854
foils your plan
and saves the day.

1134
01:35:59,984 --> 01:36:03,234
I like that ending.

1135
01:36:03,364 --> 01:36:06,324
I know something
you don't.

1136
01:36:08,284 --> 01:36:10,864
Fuck. No!

1137
01:36:13,744 --> 01:36:15,994
Yeah, man.

1138
01:36:16,124 --> 01:36:19,834
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.

1139
01:36:24,965 --> 01:36:29,425
It works better
without the safety on.

1140
01:36:35,975 --> 01:36:38,145
This is Gale Weathers
signing off.

1141
01:36:38,275 --> 01:36:40,315
Babe, you're gonna
love this!

1142
01:36:42,656 --> 01:36:44,616
Shit.

1143
01:36:46,236 --> 01:36:48,196
What?

1144
01:36:53,996 --> 01:36:56,376
Where are they?
Where are they?

1145
01:36:56,496 --> 01:36:58,457
I don't know, Billy,
but I'm hurtin', man.

1146
01:36:58,587 --> 01:37:01,797
Fuck!

1147
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:05,507
Shall I let
the machine get it?

1148
01:37:05,637 --> 01:37:08,347
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1149
01:37:08,467 --> 01:37:10,717
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?

1150
01:37:10,847 --> 01:37:13,727
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1151
01:37:13,847 --> 01:37:18,227
It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass. "

1152
01:37:18,357 --> 01:37:22,357
- Find her, you dipshit! Get up!
- I can't, Billy.
You already cut me too deep.

1153
01:37:22,487 --> 01:37:24,607
I think I'm dying here, man.

1154
01:37:27,777 --> 01:37:29,737
Talk to her.
Talk to her.

1155
01:37:36,668 --> 01:37:40,248
- Hello?
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.

1156
01:37:40,378 --> 01:37:42,338
What's your motive?
Billy's got one.

1157
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:44,548
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?

1158
01:37:44,678 --> 01:37:47,009
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.

1159
01:37:47,139 --> 01:37:49,469
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch,
just like your fucking mother!

1160
01:37:49,599 --> 01:37:53,139
- You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!

1161
01:37:53,269 --> 01:37:57,479
Ow. You fuckin' hit me
with the phone, dick!

1162
01:37:57,609 --> 01:37:59,569
Fucker, where are you?

1163
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:03,150
You fuck!

1164
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:08,660
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.

1165
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:12,040
My mom and dad are
gonna be so mad at me.

1166
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,580
Bitch!

1167
01:39:12,183 --> 01:39:14,273
My arm!

1168
01:39:21,313 --> 01:39:23,693
I always had
a thing for ya, Sid!

1169
01:39:29,453 --> 01:39:31,353
Bitch.

1170
01:39:44,224 --> 01:39:46,764
- I'm sorry. It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Randy.
I thought you were dead.

1171
01:39:46,894 --> 01:39:50,354
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1172
01:39:52,024 --> 01:39:54,944
Fucker!

1173
01:39:59,735 --> 01:40:02,365
Say hello to your mother.

1174
01:40:35,846 --> 01:40:37,806
It's okay.

1175
01:40:40,636 --> 01:40:43,436
Guess I remembered
the safety that time, you bastard.

1176
01:40:56,327 --> 01:40:58,487
Careful. This is the moment...

1177
01:40:58,617 --> 01:41:03,418
when the supposedly dead killer comes
back to life for one last scare.

1178
01:41:08,498 --> 01:41:11,418
Not in my movie.

1179
01:41:16,048 --> 01:41:19,719
Dad.
Randy, help me out.

1180
01:41:24,349 --> 01:41:27,769
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?

1181
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:30,569
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1182
01:41:32,109 --> 01:41:34,069
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1183
01:41:36,659 --> 01:41:38,699
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

1184
01:41:38,829 --> 01:41:43,499
Okay, I think it's going to go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1185
01:41:43,619 --> 01:41:46,959
Hi, this is Gale Weathers
with an exclusive eyewitness account...

1186
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:49,959
of this amazing breaking story.

1187
01:41:50,089 --> 01:41:52,470
Several more local teens
are dead...

1188
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:55,470
bringing to an end the harrowing
mystery of the mass killing...

1189
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:58,140
that has terrified
this peaceful community...

1190
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:00,930
like the plot
of some scary movie.

1191
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:03,560
It all began with
a scream over 9-1-1...

1192
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:07,901
and ended in a bloodbath that has
rocked the town of Woodsboro...

1193
01:42:08,021 --> 01:42:10,481
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...

1194
01:42:10,611 --> 01:42:13,151
far from the crimes and
the sirens of the larger cities...

1195
01:42:13,281 --> 01:42:15,321
that its residents
had fled.

1196
01:42:15,451 --> 01:42:18,071
Okay, let's take it back to one.
Come on. Move it.

1197
01:42:18,201 --> 01:42:20,831
This is my big shot.
Let's go.

1198
01:42:53,532 --> 01:42:57,663
Love comes down upon us
and it flows like water

1199
01:42:57,783 --> 01:43:01,873
Burning with the hope
of insight

1200
01:43:01,993 --> 01:43:06,003
There the books, the colours
of a bright elation

1201
01:43:06,123 --> 01:43:10,173
Stolen in the sight of love

1202
01:43:10,293 --> 01:43:14,344
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1203
01:43:14,464 --> 01:43:18,514
Fighting our way
around indecision

1204
01:43:18,634 --> 01:43:22,684
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1205
01:43:22,814 --> 01:43:29,565
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1206
01:43:35,325 --> 01:43:39,285
Birds fly in the eye
of the faithless daughters

1207
01:43:39,415 --> 01:43:43,535
Spoken at the bitter end

1208
01:43:43,665 --> 01:43:47,755
Wasted, sacrificed
for the new nirvana

1209
01:43:47,875 --> 01:43:51,965
Nighttime sends us on our way

1210
01:43:52,085 --> 01:43:56,055
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1211
01:43:56,175 --> 01:44:00,135
Fighting our way
around indecision

1212
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:04,396
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1213
01:44:04,516 --> 01:44:10,486
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1214
01:44:10,606 --> 01:44:15,026
A whisper to a scream

1215
01:44:15,156 --> 01:44:18,997
Whisper to a scream

1216
01:44:19,117 --> 01:44:25,417
A whisper to a scream

1217
01:44:33,717 --> 01:44:37,678
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1218
01:44:37,808 --> 01:44:41,978
Fighting our way
around indecision

1219
01:44:42,098 --> 01:44:46,148
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1220
01:44:46,268 --> 01:44:50,488
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1221
01:44:50,608 --> 01:44:54,568
- Whisper to a scream
- A whisper to a scream

1222
01:44:54,698 --> 01:44:58,828
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1223
01:44:58,948 --> 01:45:02,998
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1224
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:07,169
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1225
01:45:07,299 --> 01:45:11,339
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1226
01:45:11,469 --> 01:45:15,509
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1227
01:45:15,639 --> 01:45:21,519
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1228
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:25,400
Whisper to a scream

1229
01:47:14,674 --> 01:47:18,595
Look outside of my window

1230
01:47:20,765 --> 01:47:24,565
But all I see
is the rain come down

1231
01:47:26,185 --> 01:47:30,985
A pink umbrella
and a bit of her lace

1232
01:47:31,115 --> 01:47:36,326
Is all I need
and I'll come, come

1233
01:47:36,446 --> 01:47:40,456
I don't care
if you don't care

1234
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:45,166
The world looks
just fine to me

1235
01:47:47,296 --> 01:47:52,467
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1236
01:47:52,597 --> 01:47:57,137
What's it like to be free

1237
01:48:04,607 --> 01:48:09,737
I don't care
if you don't care

1238
01:48:09,857 --> 01:48:13,527
The world looks
just fine to me

1239
01:48:15,327 --> 01:48:20,457
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1240
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:26,208
What it's like to be free

1241
01:48:32,178 --> 01:48:36,468
I

1242
01:48:36,598 --> 01:48:41,809
I don't care
if you don't care

1243
01:48:41,939 --> 01:48:45,569
The world looks
just fine to me

1244
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:52,409
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1245
01:48:52,529 --> 01:48:58,790
What it's like to be free

1246
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,970
- Don't be shy
- Told you, baby

1247
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:14,590
Don't be shy
