00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,969
<i>Since before recorded time...</i>

2
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:36,536
<i>it had swung through the universe
in an elliptical orbit so large ...</i>

3
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:41,244
<i>that its very existence
remained a secret of time and space.</i>

4
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:46,113
<i>But now, in the last few years
of the 20th century,</i>

5
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:49,590
<i>the visitor was returning.</i>

6
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,939
<i>The citizens of Earth would get an extra
Christmas present this year,...</i>

7
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:04,911
<i>as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet.</i>

8
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,382
<i>Scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions,</i>

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,751
<i>something not
seen on Earth for 65 million years.</i>

10
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>Indeed, not since the time...</i>

11
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:18,759
<i>that the dinosaurs
disappeared, virtually overnight.</i>

12
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:27,202
<i>There were a few who saw this as more
than just a coincidence,</i>

13
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:31,210
<i>but most didn't..</i>

14
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:08,018
I'm showing you the top of the line here.
This is the best we have.

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,385
- This is $9.50. Now this...
- $9.50?

16
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:15,257
But wait, this is $8. Okay?
This is $7.50.

17
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,658
This lady over here,
she's wearing the $7.50.

18
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,197
Yeah, right.
- Let me tell you about this.

19
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:46,018
Blow on it. See? See how nice that is?
Isn't it great?

20
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:48,431
Now, I know you got $9.50.

21
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,383
And this spring, look at it.
Isn't that nice?

22
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,786
And the other side. Look at it.
Isn't that great? It's $9.50.

23
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,019
Enjoy the movie.

24
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,190
Excuse me. Where's the men's room?

25
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:16,763
- In a minute.
- Hey, you work here or not?

26
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:19,926
Hey, Regina.
Regina, give that thing a rest, will you?

27
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:21,024
In a minute, Mel.

28
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:24,333
Look, I don't pay you
to do that kind of stuff around here.

29
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,533
Regina, I want you to clean everything up,
so we can get out of here

30
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:30,978
in time to watch the comet.
- Everything's cleaned up.

31
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:32,340
Damn!

32
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:36,009
I want you to take this flashlight
and walk the house.

33
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:38,089
Mel, they throw things at me.

34
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:41,422
Who cares? Walk the house.

35
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:44,427
Have you ever been hit with Dots, Mel?
Milk Duds?

36
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,522
Those things hurt.
- I don't...

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,265
Oh, how are you, sir?
The refreshments are right over there.

38
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:52,669
Thank you.

39
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:56,469
I don't want those weirdoes cutting up
the seats, you understand?

40
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,545
Okay. Okay, okay.

41
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:04,719
Replacing Reg in third place is Reg.

42
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,049
Third place.

43
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:11,917
Wait a minute.

44
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:15,793
Somebody named DMK in sixth place.
When did this happen?

45
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,199
Look, don't be an overachiever. You'll fit in
better with your age group, okay?

46
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:24,306
- This is really annoying.
- Regina. Regina, look over here.

47
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:26,171
Regina, look at me!

48
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,012
Read my lips.

49
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:33,611
Flashlight. Walk house. Now.

50
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:35,682
Okay, Mel.

51
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:41,385
- Let me take this for you.
- That's great... There go the profits.

52
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:43,487
And listen, stay out
of the projection booth.

53
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:45,190
And stay away from Dupree.

54
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,791
I'm gonna fire that guy someday.

55
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:48,870
He's been doing to me
what he's been doing to her in the booth.

56
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,098
He's been doing to me
what he's been doing to her in the booth.

57
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,672
<i>- "David, that was a scream.”
- "You're right.”</i>

58
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:55,910
<i>I 'il go see. You stay here.</i>

59
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:59,779
<i>I'm talking about a mint-condition
print of ‘It Came from Outer Space’.</i>

60
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,279
In 3D, man. Yeah, right.

61
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,784
Look, you know as well as I do
you got film freaks that'd go down on you

62
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,987
for a bootleg print of that.

63
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,024
100 bucks? 100 bucks? Right.

64
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,399
Something wrong with the phone here?
Did I hear you say $100?

65
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:21,099
Look, $100 isn't gonna get it this time.

66
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,232
Because I'm gonna have to
spend the night in here

67
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:25,141
waiting for you to bring the print back.

68
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,578
Think I'm gonna miss this comet thing
for a lousy $100?

69
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:30,243
<i>"Help me!”</i>

70
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:32,718
Okay 110's a little better, yeah.

71
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:36,384
Hey, Reggie, here's the deal.
You leave, I let you in the backdoor.

72
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,927
Okay? I leave, you let me back in.
Mel thinks everybody's gone.

73
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:42,260
- Larry, do you know anybody named DMK?
- No.

74
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,833
No, you got to have the print back
by 6:00 in the morning.

75
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:47,871
You know, if we spend the night in here,
we're gonna miss the comet.

76
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,805
It's not like you can't see it
on television, you know.

77
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,638
all right, hey.
Get your guy here in an hour.

78
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:55,611
Yeah, well, maybe I want to
see it for real, okay?

79
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:58,684
Hey, television's real.
Television's very real.

80
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:01,951
So, what do you say? I'll give you $15.

81
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:04,415
Are you kidding?

82
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,356
We spend the night in here,
we end up making it,

83
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:07,519
and you give me 15 bucks?

84
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,926
Do you know
what that makes me look like?

85
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,193
Reggie, I'm not giving you $15
for making it with me.

86
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,764
Okay, well, just so
we have that straight, okay?

87
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,463
Yeah, for sure.

88
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:21,566
I mean, you'd be worth a lot more
than $15. Everybody knows that.

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,746
<i>The first earthlings to see the
effects will be in Newfundland.</i>

90
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,746
<i>Or, Newfoundland.</i>

91
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:34,056
<i>This is expected to begin at 2.04.
That's Pacific Standard Time.</i>

92
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,820
Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

93
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:40,756
<i>...Interesting sidebar to this story
is the fact that all telecommunications</i>

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,098
<i>seem to be out in that part
of the world.</i>

95
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,206
<i>This could have...</i>

96
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,075
Hello?

97
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:58,278
Samantha, you sound pissed.

98
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:01,981
I just had it out with Doris
once and for all, again.

99
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:07,485
She wants me to, like, haul chips and dips
around for her little comet party.

100
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:11,032
Yeah, well, speaking of Doris...
Look, I need your help.

101
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:14,695
Tell her that you know all about this
field trip that I'm gonna take, okay,

102
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:18,367
with my science class. We're gonna go
to the observatory to watch the comet.

103
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:21,934
<i>- She won't go for it.
- She'll go for it. Just tell her, okay?</i>

104
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,274
Okay.

105
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,991
Doris? Reggie's on the phone.

106
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,427
She's not having car trouble?

107
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:39,363
She's gonna be out all night
with her science class at the observatory.

108
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,802
I know everything.

109
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:48,173
<i>Yeah, hi, Doris.
- What's this about a science class, Regina?</i>

110
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:51,143
Well, you want me to do better
in science, don't you?

111
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,907
I want you home in five minutes
after you finish work.

112
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,417
If you wanna watch the comet,
you can do it here.

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,250
Look, Doris. I have 18 years ...

114
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:02,689
Look, Doris. Like, I'm 18, okay,
and I can watch the comet wherever
I want to watch the comet.

115
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:06,629
Here, Samantha, you and your sister
share a lot of secrets.

116
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:08,495
I want you to share this one with her.

117
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:12,128
<i>If it were up to me,
I couldn't care less what she did.</i>

118
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,365
But if your father makes it back home
without some Sandinista

119
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:17,670
blowing his brains out,

120
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,077
<i>he's gonna hold me responsible
for any kind of trouble</i>

121
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,909
<i>you two girls get into.</i>

122
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,112
What we have here is a chain of command.

123
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:27,847
The Major jumps on me, I jump on you.

124
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:31,620
Did you get that? Okay.

125
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:37,523
- Now, are you going to join the party?
- Join the party for what Doris?

126
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,499
So I can watch Chuck from across the street

127
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,867
stick his hands down your pants?

128
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,574
I think that's something
Daddy should know.

129
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:48,006
Chuck's a nice guy.
He's certainly nice to be with

130
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,944
while Daddy's down in Banana Land.

131
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:53,710
You were born with an asshole, Doris.
You don't need Chuck.

132
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:05,959
<i>Looks like a real nice crowd
we have out here tonight.</i>

133
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:18,772
Sarah, Chucky.

134
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,407
Hey, where have you been? You're gonna
miss everything. It's going to start.

135
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:24,611
Oh, kids.
I'll never marry another man with kids.

136
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,417
In 1910, Halley's comet returned.

137
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,421
Everybody thought
they were going to die then.

138
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,965
- What was that?
- Look!

139
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,042
You wanna know what bugs me about all this?

140
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,208
What?

141
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,950
Well, I'm always afraid
someone's gonna see us, you know?

142
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:59,356
See us how? There's no windows.
They can't see through walls.

143
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:02,687
Well, Superman can see through walls.

144
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:06,892
Not these walls. They're made out of steel.
Used to be a fire law.

145
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:10,602
Superman can see through steel.

146
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:14,476
No, it's the one thing he cannot see through.

147
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,873
That's lead, you nerd.
- Lead?

148
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,715
Yeah. I mean, Superman can see through
steel like it wasn't there, even.

149
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,245
Larry!

150
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:28,292
<i>Well, I guess I'm the only one who's not
outside watching the meteor shower.</i>

151
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,430
<i>Perhaps put the radio on autopilot
and leave me.</i>

152
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,159
<i>I just might put the radio station
on autopilot and sneak out myself.</i>

153
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,744
<i>This is the Big K
of Los Angeles. A great-looking morning</i>

154
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:14,875
<i>in southern California. 50,000 watts
of oil, steel, and passion FM in the a.m..</i>

155
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:18,513
<i>It's wake-up time in the City of Angels.
And I'm Steve LaBeau.</i>

156
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,625
- God damn it!
- What?

157
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:22,919
What?

158
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,127
I've been waiting by that door
for the last 30 minutes,

159
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:28,564
and that pinhead hasn't brought
the film back yet.

160
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,795
Give the guy a break.
I mean, people are late sometimes.

161
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:36,542
No, something's wrong.
If he screwed that film up,

162
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:39,044
we could all be in a lot of trouble.

163
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:41,914
I'm gonna go over there on the bike.

164
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:45,009
Oh, jeez!
Don't I get an Egg McMuffin or anything?

165
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,690
- You could do me a favor.
- I did you a favor last night.

166
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:50,225
If that guy calls,

167
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:55,529
you tell him I'm on my way over,
and I'm very, very, very, very pissed.

168
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:58,965
- Hey, what about my 15 bucks?
- Tell him you're pissed, too.

169
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:20,451
DMK.

170
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:29,131
You trust people, you get
screwed over every goddamn time.

171
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,976
Is that you?
Yeah, it's about frigging time.

172
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:18,784
That's the end of you, DMK.
You're history.

173
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,891
God, bad smog.

174
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,928
Shit!

175
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:28,765
Shit!

176
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:32,210
Oh, damn it!

177
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:34,812
Just great!

178
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:40,452
I don't believe this,
there's clothes everywhere!

179
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,026
I hate days that start like this.

180
00:16:57,775 --> 00:17:00,402
Oh, damn it, damn it!

181
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,417
Eww. Gross.

182
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,463
Larry?

183
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,420
What is this? Trick or treat?

184
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,823
- Come here.
- What?

185
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:17,293
- Come here!
- Come here, your ass.

186
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:26,542
Alright look, I don't know what your scene
is, but don't do anything stupid, okay?

187
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:33,908
No, you don't seem to understand.
I've been trained to take care of myself.

188
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,782
You know what I'm saying?
I don't want to hurt you.

189
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:41,719
Oh, shit!

190
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:48,858
No!

191
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:55,399
Let go of me!

192
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:57,078
No!

193
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:09,819
Come on, come on, come on!

194
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:01,815
Samantha?

195
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,553
Doris?

196
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,440
- Samantha?
- What?

197
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:52,974
God. What are you trying to do?
Give me a heart attack?

198
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,847
- I thought you were Doris.
- You know, she decked me last night.

199
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:57,386
Knocked one of my teeth loose, even.

200
00:22:57,488 --> 00:22:59,456
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

201
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,821
You know how he's always telling me
to be careful with my mouth

202
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:05,191
on account of the dental plan
doesn't cover anything cosmetic.

203
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:09,892
Anyway, get this. I think Chuck and Doris
spent the night together last night.

204
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,936
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

205
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:15,974
I mean, even if he isn't pissed off
about my mouth, which I can't imagine.

206
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,541
What's happening?

207
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:21,171
Oh, yeah, I guess you are a little confused.

208
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,151
God, you look terrible.

209
00:23:24,252 --> 00:23:27,881
I ran away last night after she slugged me.
Left a note and everything.

210
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,185
But I didn't have any place to go,
so I spent the night

211
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:31,954
in a lawn storage shed.

212
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:35,320
It was pretty gross with the Synerol
and everything.

213
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,762
God, look at this kitchen.

214
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:40,769
I'm not cleaning this up.

215
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:43,604
So anyway, since I was still here
this morning,

216
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:48,041
I thought, hey, I'll go
to pep squad practice and split after.

217
00:23:48,346 --> 00:23:50,837
Except for I don't know
if pep squad practice is on or not.

218
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,315
I can't get anybody on the phone.

219
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:57,048
Sammy, you can't get anybody
on the phone because everybody is gone.

220
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,757
What? could you grab the milk, please?

221
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:03,028
- I swear to God!
- You made me swallow my gum.

222
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:05,598
There's nobody.
I mean, there's no body!

223
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:09,701
Oh, right. Nobody. I'm sure.

224
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:11,605
- Come here.
- Hey!

225
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:14,142
Back off!

226
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:16,402
This sweater cost 80 bucks.

227
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,642
Muffy?

228
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:26,519
Stupid dog.

229
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:28,719
Look! Look at this!

230
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:35,531
- At what?
- Doris isn't at Chuck's. I'll show you Doris.

231
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,629
Here's Doris.

232
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:41,730
This is all that's left of her,
this and dust.

233
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,570
Look, here's Chuck.

234
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:55,717
Where are the kids?

235
00:24:58,427 --> 00:25:01,954
It's Saturday morning.
Where are the goddamn kids?

236
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,522
They're around.

237
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:31,159
They're not around.

238
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,598
Look, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing it, okay?

239
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:39,096
- I'm not trying to scare you.
- Then stop it.

240
00:25:39,307 --> 00:25:40,672
I'm not doing it.

241
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:44,770
You try calling someone.
Not just your pep squad. Anyone.

242
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:46,471
Nobody's home!

243
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,950
<i>Unbelievable, that's song number 16
on the survey this week.</i>

244
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:53,022
<i>Don't forget, we preview the top 20
every Friday night.</i>

245
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:55,717
<i>A great way to start a super weekend
here in the southland.</i>

246
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:56,851
<i>Get down!</i>

247
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:25,183
- Are you sure this is the radio station?
- Yeah. Just go on in.

248
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:26,625
Well, don't push.

249
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,269
Do you think whatever happened,
happened everywhere?

250
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:43,539
Like in Burbank or places like that?

251
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,711
We'll ask the DJ.
He does the news, doesn't he?

252
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,187
Search me. I always change the channel
when the news comes on.

253
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:58,228
Here's something in here.

254
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,997
So, where is he?

255
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,807
I mean, somebody has to run this stuff,
don't they?

256
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:16,780
<i>We've got trouble. Not us.
That's the name of the song.</i>

257
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,250
<i>And I'm Steve LaBeau
trapped inside your radio.</i>

258
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:20,220
<i>The guy who really cares about you.</i>

259
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:22,314
<i>I mean, who else would sit
in this little box every day</i>

260
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,484
<i>just to play music for you?</i>

261
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:27,189
<i>Well, it's time to reach into
the old mailbag here. Got a letter from...</i>

262
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:29,391
Beam me up, Scotty.

263
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,095
Okay, girls. Hold it right there.

264
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:35,605
- You, the blonde, get into the light.
- Wait.

265
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,776
Why don't you just let my sister go.

266
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:40,504
And maybe you and I
can work something out.

267
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:41,875
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Shut up!

268
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:43,949
You got the wrong idea.
You, into the light.

269
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,316
I'll give you to five. One, two... No?

270
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:53,550
All right. Let's try it this way.
Five, four, three...

271
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,026
Okay, okay.

272
00:27:55,497 --> 00:27:58,125
Do you get a lot of dates this way?

273
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,660
Open your eyes.

274
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,203
Okay.

275
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:14,984
Hey, I know what you're thinking, but...
- That you're a cretin?

276
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:20,246
Sweetheart, you haven't seen those
freaked-out zombies running around here?

277
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,827
Yeah, I was jumped by one.

278
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:24,589
Well, you got off lucky.

279
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:27,594
Me and this girl pulled into town
this morning.

280
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,429
You don't work here?

281
00:28:30,204 --> 00:28:31,933
No. I drive a truck.

282
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:36,206
I was heading to San Diego
with this girl I picked up.

283
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,803
We were looking for a gas station.

284
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:42,607
That's when we spotted one of those...

285
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:45,412
Whatever they are.

286
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:48,848
Looked like it was eating...

287
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:50,850
Looked like it was eating a cat.

288
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,656
A dead cat?

289
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,691
Semi-dead.

290
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,292
Who'd want to eat a live cat?

291
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,761
Beats the shit out of me.

292
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,497
This girl freaked out.

293
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,167
Took off running.

294
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,645
I spotted her about 20 minutes later.

295
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:16,050
- Looked like one of those things had...
- What?

296
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:22,558
Torn her apart.

297
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:27,363
Oh, God.

298
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:32,000
- Larry.
- Oh, shit.

299
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:34,970
What's with her?

300
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:39,146
I think she's going to be
sick or something.

301
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,807
A guy she knew...

302
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:43,477
Same thing might have happened.

303
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,556
- Is it safe around here, do you think?
- Yeah.

304
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:53,562
I checked it out.

305
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,328
Swell.

306
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:07,946
Are you all right?

307
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:13,752
My name's Hector.

308
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:18,350
- What's yours?
- Just leave me alone, okay?

309
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:24,629
Look, I... I know we got off
on the wrong foot,

310
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:30,206
but considering what the alternative is,
I think we should try to get along.

311
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:31,867
What do you say?

312
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,273
Listen, this is no time
for an attitude problem.

313
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:41,076
Your little sister seems to be taking this
a lot better than you.

314
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,556
That's 'cause she doesn't know
what's going on.

315
00:30:43,656 --> 00:30:44,680
And you do, I suppose.

316
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:47,783
Whatever is going on isn't just here.
It's everywhere.

317
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:50,993
She thinks we're gonna be rescued,
that our dad's gonna come back

318
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:53,963
from Honduras
with the goddamn Green Berets.

319
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,502
She could be right.

320
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,664
Give us a break, Hector.

321
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:06,177
Where did you spend the night last night?

322
00:31:11,221 --> 00:31:14,884
I spent the night in the back of my truck
with the girl I picked up.

323
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:19,294
- What else do you want to know?
- Skip it.

324
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,698
Steel's gotta be the answer.

325
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,599
If Sam spent the night
in the Lawn storage shed...

326
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:28,641
What?

327
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:31,535
<i>...again, I'm an employee. I can't.</i>

328
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:34,911
<i>Just our way of saying
Merry Christmas to you from all of...</i>

329
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:55,201
<i>Testing, one, two, three, four.</i>

330
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:03,444
<i>This is Samantha Belmont,</i>

331
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:07,781
<i>one-third owner of
the Greater Los Angeles Basin, speaking.</i>

332
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:10,879
<i>You guys?</i>

333
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:13,752
<i>Hey, is anybody there?</i>

334
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,694
Where did you get this,
a Dime Store?

335
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:22,463
Beats me. It was given to me.

336
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:25,532
Yeah, well, it might be all right
for date night in the barrio,

337
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:27,802
but if we run into any more
of those guys outside,

338
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,504
we're gonna need
a little more stopping power.

339
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,546
Date night in the barrio?

340
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,889
Here are other changes.

341
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,662
And here's some other changes.
Most of you guys had finals this week?

342
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,390
Huh, Later.

343
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:54,865
They are history. Canceled.

344
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:59,240
They're history. They're cancelled.
The legal drinking age is now 10.
But, you will need ID. Let's be real.

345
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:04,006
I'll be taking take requests from all you
teenage comet zombies on the...
Hit line!

346
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:09,250
That's 555-4487.

347
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:12,187
Get it? 555-HITS!

348
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:24,902
Do you know where the armed forces
reserve centre is at Los Alamitos?

349
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,067
Yeah.

350
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:29,542
My dad used to take us there
for target practice.

351
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:34,485
They store automatic weapons there.
- You know how to use them?

352
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:37,146
Come on, Hector.

353
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:41,187
The MAC-10 submachine gun
was practically designed for housewives.

354
00:33:43,863 --> 00:33:45,330
I got a call!

355
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:48,792
It came in on the hit line.
- Hello?

356
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:51,430
Hello?

357
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,734
It went dead.
- Did they say they were okay?

358
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:56,003
I don't know.
They said they were in the desert.

359
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:58,443
- The desert? What desert was it?
- I don't know.

360
00:33:58,548 --> 00:33:59,674
Shit! Think!

361
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:02,307
Why don't you just pull your gun
on her? Maybe you can scare it out of her!

362
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:06,822
<i>They said they were, like, part of
a think tank or research group or something.</i>

363
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,721
<i>Where? Was it in this state?</i>

364
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:12,726
<i>- I forget.
- Okay. Let's take it real slow.</i>

365
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:15,599
<i>Did they mention a town?</i>

366
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,963
<i>Some place they were near,
like maybe Blythe, Bishop?</i>

367
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:22,363
<i>- What about Edwards Air Force Base?
- If I knew, I'd tell you.</i>

368
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:25,535
<i>I didn't expect the call, you know.
I didn't take notes or something.</i>

369
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:26,839
<i>Just try and remember.</i>

370
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:29,347
<i>If you think I'm not telling you
something on purpose...</i>

371
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,041
Well, if they'll stay put,
we can get them.

372
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,119
<i>...leave anything out?</i>

373
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,688
From a psychological standpoint,
the radio station represents

374
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:35,778
a link to normalcy.

375
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,586
I don't think they'll wander far
as long as it's operating.

376
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:42,829
Dr. Carter, I'd just like to say upfront.
I'm opposed to this.

377
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,958
There is no reason for us to bring
those people,

378
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,531
or any other survivors back here.

379
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:53,299
What about the disintegration factor?
You just want to let that happen?

380
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:56,473
We don't know that
the condition is progressive.

381
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,571
I think we've established that, Audrey.

382
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:01,743
Partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect,

383
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:03,821
but progression is steady in any case.

384
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:07,256
Drying of the body fluids...
Get to the point, Oscar.

385
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,088
We've heard this a thousand times.

386
00:35:10,197 --> 00:35:13,166
Ultimately, there is nothing left
but calcium dust.

387
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:18,033
Right. So there isn't even enough hope
to warrant bringing anybody back here.

388
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:22,408
So, what you're saying is,
we shouldn't even try.

389
00:35:23,611 --> 00:35:24,578
Right.

390
00:35:27,149 --> 00:35:31,108
We don't want to be caught in the city
after dark. we'll leave tomorrow.

391
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:34,683
And we've had an indication
of some survivors...

392
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,281
in San Bernardino as well.

393
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:37,261
Four, maybe five.

394
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:39,761
<i>Wait a minute.
Wait, girls, just shut up.</i>

395
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:44,861
<i>Samantha! Did they say
anything else? Anything?</i>

396
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:51,134
<i>Yeah. They said
be careful on the street.</i>

397
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:56,078
<i>Because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit.</i>

398
00:35:56,749 --> 00:36:01,083
<i>What happened to Doris
is happening to them, only slower.</i>

399
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:06,482
<i>And, like, they're dangerous.</i>

400
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,594
<i>Like what happened to Larry.</i>

401
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:48,741
You're not going to blame me
because the phone went dead.

402
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:53,109
I'm not the phone company.
Nobody is the phone company anymore.

403
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:08,891
What?

404
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:11,694
Cops?

405
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:15,529
Where were you guys earlier?

406
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,878
Oh, shit, my license.

407
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:29,416
Oh, shit!

408
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:40,357
I know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something,

409
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,431
but I'm really glad to see...

410
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:02,653
<i> ...the weekend comet sale.
Everything must go.</i>

411
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:04,854
<i>Big savings on tuners, turntables,
car stereos,</i>

412
00:38:04,964 --> 00:38:06,989
<i>also demos of great damaged items.</i>

413
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,830
<i>This weekend only, Henry's
Stereo Warehouse. Fourth and Alameda.</i>

414
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:13,134
<i>Free coffee for the adults.
Free balloons for the kids.</i>

415
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:40,062
This is for your step mom,
you little punk.

416
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:45,267
- Ahh! They're here! They're here!
- Where?

417
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:47,779
- What's wrong?
- It's okay. I've got her.

418
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:50,873
- You've got her?
- Yeah, I got her.

419
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:59,860
Sammy, Sam, it's only a dream.

420
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:02,997
I know.

421
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,366
I know.

422
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,165
<i>...expand your career
horizons. For a clearer view of...</i>

423
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,332
Is there anything I can do?

424
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13,703
I'm fine.

425
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:16,247
<i>Interstate Technologies
is an equal-opportunity employer.</i>

426
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:19,546
<i>Looks like the weather is shaping up
for a great weekend.</i>

427
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:23,143
<i>You know, it's hard to believe that there's
only 11 more shopping days till Christmas.</i>

428
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:26,555
<i>Good luck finding a parking space within
hitchhiking distance of the malls, too.</i>

429
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,854
<i>You know how jammed it can get.</i>

430
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:41,865
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, I guess so.

431
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:46,576
Come on in. Have a seat.

432
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:56,147
Listen, I have to go
to San Diego tomorrow.

433
00:40:57,361 --> 00:40:58,555
Why?

434
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:00,995
My mom.

435
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,096
- Some friends. My sister.
- But you know they're gone.

436
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,967
I know, but I still have to find out.

437
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:13,842
I mean, you guys know for sure,
but I don't know.

438
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,282
Did you have, like, a close family?

439
00:41:21,288 --> 00:41:24,223
Yeah, pretty close.

440
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:29,564
- And you?
- Not anymore.

441
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,861
My real mom hung around until my dad
came back from Vietnam, then she split.

442
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:38,337
So it's been mostly me and Sam and Dad

443
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:40,902
and the 3rd special forces.

444
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:45,476
Smoke Bomb Hill. Fort Bragg.

445
00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:54,458
But then around about
sixth or seventh grade,

446
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:56,721
it became real obvious
that we weren't boys,

447
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,663
that we were never going to go
to ranger school.

448
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:04,532
So I guess Dad figured there was
nothing more to offer us.

449
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:09,209
So he found us a new mom
and went off looking for a war.

450
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:16,543
What about the em...

451
00:42:18,922 --> 00:42:22,084
The guy. Larry?

452
00:42:22,726 --> 00:42:26,218
Oh, he and I weren't going steady
or anything like that.

453
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:46,281
- Look, don't go to San Diego, okay?
- I have to.

454
00:42:47,722 --> 00:42:49,314
But I'll be back.

455
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,387
Please, okay?

456
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:02,999
What will you give me if I come back?

457
00:43:09,814 --> 00:43:11,338
Texas.

458
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:18,489
<i>Could give you Florida. Florida and Texas.
Florida, Texas and Hawaii.</i>

459
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,292
<i>- Hawaii? I wanted Hawaii.
- When I come back,</i>

460
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:29,994
<i>I'll take you to dinner.</i>

461
00:43:31,805 --> 00:43:33,102
<i>Your choice.</i>

462
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:49,916
Here.

463
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:06,577
Great!

464
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:17,386
See? This is the problem
with these things.

465
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,483
Daddy would have gotten us Uzis.

466
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:24,030
The car didn't know the difference.

467
00:44:33,176 --> 00:44:35,474
So, did you make it with him last night?

468
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:38,613
- Who?
- The Good Humor Man. Who do you think?

469
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:43,585
- Jeez. Is that what's bugging you?
- That's no answer, man.

470
00:44:44,657 --> 00:44:47,319
No, I didn't make it with him last night.

471
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:49,087
Why are you so weirded out?

472
00:44:49,195 --> 00:44:51,026
Oh, right, Reg.
Why should I be weirded out?

473
00:44:51,131 --> 00:44:53,598
My sister, who swiped every guy
I ever had my eye on

474
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:56,964
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freaked-out world.

475
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,884
Mom?

476
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:47,551
Mother?

477
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:51,996
Mom.

478
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:19,431
I don't know who you are out there,
but I have a gun.

479
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:23,530
So if I were you,
I'd split while I had a chance.

480
00:47:25,074 --> 00:47:26,165
Okay?

481
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,323
Look, kid, just stay away.
We don't want any.

482
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:44,886
Shit!

483
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,599
Get out of here, you little freak.

484
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,444
Lucky for you I like kids.

485
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:10,623
Jeez! There goes the neighborhood.

486
00:48:27,711 --> 00:48:28,769
Shit.

487
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:36,821
Audrey, what's the code?

488
00:48:58,314 --> 00:49:00,043
We found survivors.

489
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,250
How long will the blood test take?

490
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:07,649
Not long.

491
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:11,023
I've talked with some of the others,
and we've decided

492
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:15,531
that it would be more beneficial
to conduct the blood tests in the field.

493
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:19,102
So I want you to go to LA
with the rest of the group.

494
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:21,230
Whatever the majority wants.

495
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,906
<i>You don't seem to hold
majority rule in very high regard.</i>

496
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:32,384
<i>If something's wrong, it's wrong.</i>

497
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:35,284
<i>Majority rule doesn't have anything
to do with it.</i>

498
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:37,888
But it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group,

499
00:49:37,993 --> 00:49:39,426
which is to survive.

500
00:49:39,828 --> 00:49:41,591
You'll grant me that?

501
00:49:41,797 --> 00:49:45,893
The core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility.

502
00:50:50,476 --> 00:50:52,967
That's about the twelfth can
you've downed this morning.

503
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,138
Thirsty.

504
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:57,011
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do
when your complexion freaks out?

505
00:50:57,117 --> 00:50:59,243
Dermatologist is dead, you know.

506
00:50:59,386 --> 00:51:02,287
I know and I'm getting a rash
or something, too.

507
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:03,947
Oh, God. You and your rashes.

508
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:07,255
Hey, I'm sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous.

509
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,066
So, do you like him?

510
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,941
- Come on, Sam.
- I'm just interested.

511
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:27,679
Yeah, well, I guess so.
I mean, he's nice.

512
00:51:31,056 --> 00:51:33,718
There was this new guy at school.
Paul Morgan.

513
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:36,517
He transferred from Taft. Junior.

514
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,624
Oh, I don't hang around
with juniors much.

515
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:43,801
I liked him.

516
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:48,763
I mean, he was from Taft,

517
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:53,112
but, he was nice.

518
00:51:59,156 --> 00:52:02,056
Kathy said he was probably
gonna ask me out.

519
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:05,620
Huh, Kathy.

520
00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:09,659
She was flunking algebra
and she was trying to figure out some way

521
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:12,327
to keep her parents from finding out.

522
00:52:15,274 --> 00:52:17,765
This is really a lucky break for her.

523
00:52:24,484 --> 00:52:27,715
No wonder I'm breaking out.
Think we could go home and change?

524
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:32,451
- Why don't we get a little creative?
- What?

525
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:37,290
- Do you have your a,
do you have your MasterCard on you?
- No.

526
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,164
Good, 'cause you don't need it.

527
00:52:40,268 --> 00:52:42,566
The stores are open!

528
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:56,953
Hey, Reg, which do you like better?
This?

529
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,051
Second one. Yeah. Definitely.

530
00:54:01,162 --> 00:54:04,528
- How come?
- 'Cause it'll stay in style longer.

531
00:54:05,433 --> 00:54:07,765
<i>- Come on.
- I guess you're right, actually.</i>

532
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,963
<i>Yeah, we got to think
of these things, you know?</i>

533
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:32,957
Well, let's do it.

534
00:54:39,005 --> 00:54:42,873
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Don't set any dangerous precedents.

535
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,308
What if Hector's got
the same problem we have?

536
00:54:45,412 --> 00:54:49,314
- Such as?
- Such as, no guys.

537
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:52,012
- What?
- Really.

538
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,983
I mean, what if Hector's gay?

539
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:00,925
- I'm sure.
- Think it over.

540
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,260
You said he didn't
come on to you last night.

541
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,333
So?

542
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:08,336
So that means that the last guy on earth
is either a gentleman or a fag.

543
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:11,334
I mean, what are the odds? In LA?

544
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:15,810
Things could be very interesting
around here, Regina.

545
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,794
<i>Attention, shoppers.</i>

546
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,794
<i>I trust you've got credit cards
to pay for all that stuff.</i>

547
00:56:04,303 --> 00:56:06,703
<i>What's the matter?
Lost something?</i>

548
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,367
<i>Check with lost and found
on the second floor.</i>

549
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:12,905
Didn't find this one.

550
00:56:22,157 --> 00:56:24,648
You dirty rat.

551
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:28,497
<i>Get her, boys!</i>

552
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:31,796
Woa!

553
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:57,092
<i>Bummer!</i>

554
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:03,933
Well, I think it's time
to take the high ground.

555
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:14,911
Listen, you guys, we're expecting
some friends here any minute.

556
00:58:15,153 --> 00:58:18,816
Look, you just split now, okay,
and we'll Tell them not to hurt you.

557
00:58:24,097 --> 00:58:26,190
No imagination.

558
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,684
Look, over there.

559
00:58:58,436 --> 00:58:59,494
Hey!

560
00:59:00,606 --> 00:59:04,235
- Hey!
- Eat glass, creeps!

561
00:59:06,479 --> 00:59:08,344
How did you like that?

562
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:15,688
You guys are a bunch of wimps!
You can't hit anything.

563
00:59:17,759 --> 00:59:18,885
Hi.

564
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:30,299
Get her.

565
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:51,058
Knock that shit off!

566
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:59,334
Hello out there in Television Land.

567
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:03,041
All right. Here's the deal.

568
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:07,511
If bachelorette number one
isn't out here in half a tick,

569
01:00:07,616 --> 01:00:12,246
I'm going to ice bachelorette number two.
Got it?

570
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:29,601
Come on.

571
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:35,778
Let her go.

572
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:40,675
I'm sorry, miss, I can't have you
holding one of my people hostage.

573
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:44,654
Even if you pull the trigger,
I can still take him out. And you.

574
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:46,486
Come on, Willy, she means it.

575
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:48,994
Miss, you're not getting the point.

576
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:52,259
I can't have you holding
one of my people hostage.

577
01:00:57,974 --> 01:00:59,407
You're crazy!

578
01:00:59,509 --> 01:01:02,273
I'm not crazy.
I just don't give a fuck.

579
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:06,078
<i>- What do you think, 20, 30 minutes?
- No more.</i>

580
01:01:06,217 --> 01:01:09,310
They could be anywhere by now.
Let's go back.

581
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:13,082
- Let's apply a little deductive reasoning.
- Deductive reasoning?

582
01:01:14,826 --> 01:01:17,795
Where would adolescents
with nothing to do go?

583
01:01:24,338 --> 01:01:28,206
See, we worked really hard to
get ahead in this business, girls.

584
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,834
And we don't get shit for it!

585
01:01:31,913 --> 01:01:33,244
But we do it...

586
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:36,244
because we know we can work
our way up through the system.

587
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:37,512
And the system works

588
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:42,021
Why, just a few days ago,
we were only stock boys.

589
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:46,722
Now we own the store.
The American way.

590
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,961
And then this happens.

591
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:52,894
What are you talking about?

592
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:57,604
I'm talking about you
coming in here and ripping us off.

593
01:01:57,709 --> 01:02:00,906
What do you want?
You want us to pay for it? What?

594
01:02:04,384 --> 01:02:07,182
You wouldn't believe
what we want from you.

595
01:02:07,554 --> 01:02:12,422
In your worst nightmare,
you wouldn't believe.

596
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:19,860
Let's play a game.
It's called ‘Scary Noises’.

597
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:24,261
This is the closest shopping arcade,
but the whole area

598
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:26,967
is an absolute monument
to consumerism.

599
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,007
All we can do is hope.

600
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,113
Check all the fiords,
including the basement.

601
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,882
Isn't that a scary noise?
Wanna hear it again?

602
01:02:44,229 --> 01:02:46,823
Gosh! The suspense is killing me.

603
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:50,594
Let's do it again.

604
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:56,330
An E-ticket attraction.
Let's do it again.

605
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:01,875
Now wait a minute.

606
01:03:02,017 --> 01:03:05,043
I don't think
there's really a bullet in here.

607
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:09,515
No. Now, see there, it's loaded.

608
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:12,522
I just needed
to be a little more patient.

609
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:16,055
I think this is it, girls.
I really do.

610
01:03:42,162 --> 01:03:43,857
We're not with these guys.

611
01:03:43,964 --> 01:03:46,432
Really, like, we just met them
an hour ago.

612
01:03:48,736 --> 01:03:51,671
I mean, look at this stuff.
Look at this skirt.

613
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:56,507
<i>It's ironic. Of all the great minds
of the world, all the great intellects,</i>

614
01:03:56,613 --> 01:03:59,878
<i>- Who should survive? Or almost survive?
- I’m so thirsty</i>

615
01:04:01,418 --> 01:04:04,410
<i>I don't have to see the result
of the blood test.</i>

616
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:07,286
I can guess
what they say about that one.

617
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:12,095
You're right.

618
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:16,866
It would be senseless to take her back.
Look, I'll stay and take care of it.

619
01:04:16,968 --> 01:04:20,927
Then if this Hector person shows up,
I can run tests on him, too.

620
01:04:21,307 --> 01:04:25,710
Of course, it would be out of the question
to let you remain by yourself.

621
01:04:26,747 --> 01:04:28,715
I'll stay here with you.

622
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:52,138
Listen, thanks for suggesting
that I wait for Hector.

623
01:04:52,243 --> 01:04:56,407
I mean, I know Reggie'll probably get him,
but I'd like to have a shot at it.

624
01:04:56,515 --> 01:04:58,881
Samantha, I need you to lie down.

625
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:01,579
Hector's not exactly a fox,

626
01:05:02,522 --> 01:05:05,286
but considering what's left,
he's not bad.

627
01:05:05,692 --> 01:05:09,822
- He sounds cute. Is he coming back?
- Yeah.

628
01:05:10,564 --> 01:05:13,623
But we should wait for him
at the radio station.

629
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:16,698
That's where he'll go.
What's that?

630
01:05:18,907 --> 01:05:21,398
- I'm going to give you something.
- For what?

631
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:26,077
Well, your skin's
been a little irritated.

632
01:05:26,582 --> 01:05:28,015
Yeah, a rash.

633
01:05:28,117 --> 01:05:31,917
It could be a rash,
but it could also be something else.

634
01:05:32,189 --> 01:05:34,749
- That's one of the main symptoms of...
- The comet? No.

635
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:39,558
See, I always get rashes,
like, when I have a fight with Doris,

636
01:05:39,665 --> 01:05:42,224
or I break up with a boyfriend.
It's nerves.

637
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:45,359
And you know, the way things have
been going around here lately,

638
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,565
I'm surprised I don't
look like strawberry Jell-O.

639
01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:54,139
But if I do have that stuff,
this will get rid of it, right?

640
01:05:56,283 --> 01:05:58,774
- Yeah.
- God, you had me worried.

641
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:03,613
Don't worry. Just a pinch now.

642
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,060
Ow!
So, you guys are, like, geniuses, right?

643
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,872
Yeah, I thought so.

644
01:06:25,617 --> 01:06:28,017
We have a couple of
geniuses at my school.

645
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,945
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

646
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:51,707
Is...

647
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:55,114
Is that it?

648
01:06:57,253 --> 01:06:59,619
What did you want me to do, Oscar,

649
01:06:59,723 --> 01:07:02,590
take her out back
and shoot her in the head?

650
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,456
I simply meant
I was glad it was painless.

651
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:11,894
I don't think we have to stay around.

652
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:15,334
She didn't think that he was coming back.

653
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,369
I feel we can wait.

654
01:07:18,678 --> 01:07:19,804
But...

655
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,110
I feel the radio station
is the more logical place.

656
01:07:28,155 --> 01:07:33,092
Listen, Oscar, you were right
about the condition being progressive.

657
01:07:33,795 --> 01:07:37,287
But it is also accelerating,
apparently.

658
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,096
We don't have weeks.

659
01:07:40,604 --> 01:07:42,731
We have maybe hours.
I don't know.

660
01:07:43,507 --> 01:07:46,134
- We have a commitment.
- But I do know I don't have enough

661
01:07:46,243 --> 01:07:51,180
to debate the issue. I am not going to be
a party to taking anybody else back.

662
01:07:51,816 --> 01:07:53,681
You have to live up to it.

663
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:58,819
What do you expect me to do, Oscar,
go for my gun?

664
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,782
Of course not.

665
01:08:41,373 --> 01:08:44,342
<i>It's 450 FM in the p.m.
I'm Steve LaBeau,</i>

666
01:08:44,443 --> 01:08:47,843
<i>and you're listening to 50,000 watts
of rock 'n'roll at the tower of power</i>

667
01:08:47,947 --> 01:08:49,915
<i>over the City of Angels.</i>

668
01:09:09,772 --> 01:09:12,935
Reggie! Merry Christmas.

669
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:18,841
Reggie?

670
01:09:25,156 --> 01:09:27,056
Samantha?

671
01:09:32,598 --> 01:09:33,565
Hi.

672
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,767
Hi.

673
01:09:39,473 --> 01:09:44,001
Did you happen to see two girls
running around here?
One is a cheerleader.

674
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:47,108
I'm not thinking straight.

675
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:52,576
I wrote everything down,
but I think I misspelled it.

676
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,922
That pad on the table.

677
01:09:56,926 --> 01:10:00,828
- You need this?
- No, thanks. I have one.

678
01:10:02,767 --> 01:10:06,032
It seems to be
the perfect Christmas gift this year.

679
01:10:07,038 --> 01:10:11,498
I'm going to miss Christmas,
permanently.

680
01:10:14,414 --> 01:10:18,816
I want you to know that
I thought they were talking hypothetically,

681
01:10:19,117 --> 01:10:21,347
until they found the first survivors.

682
01:10:21,454 --> 01:10:23,388
Then they really did it.

683
01:10:25,826 --> 01:10:27,794
Some of those survivors were just kids.

684
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:30,659
Hey, wait a minute.
What's all this about blood?

685
01:10:34,069 --> 01:10:36,435
They think they can generate a serum.

686
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:42,176
- A serum?
- We were exposed. Not a lot. Just enough.

687
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:47,742
They left the ventilating ducts wide open.
The fans going.

688
01:10:47,985 --> 01:10:50,078
Very scientific.

689
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,717
Very stupid.

690
01:10:54,425 --> 01:10:59,362
In 36 hours,
you will be able to vacuum up

691
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:01,362
the last of them from the carpet.

692
01:11:04,237 --> 01:11:07,638
Hey, you know what?

693
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,809
She was right. You are cute.

694
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,049
Santa Claus.

695
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:30,593
Hey.

696
01:11:48,754 --> 01:11:50,483
Have you ever had hepatitis?

697
01:11:50,589 --> 01:11:51,988
Darned tags.

698
01:11:52,459 --> 01:11:53,926
You have a pair of scissors?

699
01:11:55,028 --> 01:11:57,656
No. Have you ever had hepatitis?

700
01:12:00,768 --> 01:12:02,099
Cute kids.

701
01:12:03,004 --> 01:12:04,801
They part of you guys?

702
01:12:04,907 --> 01:12:09,207
No. They're survivors just like you are.

703
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:12,107
- Neat girl, huh?
- If you like the type.

704
01:12:13,016 --> 01:12:14,881
Come on, kids. Come with me.

705
01:12:17,288 --> 01:12:19,312
Have you ever had hepatitis?

706
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,327
No. I had mono once, though.
Caught it from this guy named Randy Sharp.

707
01:12:28,633 --> 01:12:30,760
- Anemia?
- No.

708
01:12:31,437 --> 01:12:34,702
- Are you pregnant?
- No. Thought I was once, though.

709
01:12:36,543 --> 01:12:39,979
- That's not important.
- That's what you think.

710
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,947
It was the longest three weeks
of my life.

711
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:49,520
You know, I can't remember.

712
01:12:49,624 --> 01:12:52,752
How much blood were we expected
to get from these people?

713
01:12:52,928 --> 01:12:56,420
Oh, 300 ccs. Yes, that's it.

714
01:12:56,532 --> 01:13:00,730
That can't be right. If we draw 300 ccs
a day, they'll expire altogether.

715
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:01,996
No, I don't think so,

716
01:13:02,105 --> 01:13:04,630
now that we've
terminated brain functions.

717
01:13:04,742 --> 01:13:06,369
I mean, they're brain-dead.

718
01:13:06,477 --> 01:13:09,674
All they can do now
is manufacture blood.

719
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:12,844
Well, maybe.

720
01:13:13,752 --> 01:13:17,279
We aren't gonna get anything like 300 ccs
out of those children.

721
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,352
No. But, we will out of that teenager.

722
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,858
I hope she's just as healthy as she looks.

723
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:26,057
Boy, did you see her hair?
What I'd give to have hair like that.

724
01:13:28,135 --> 01:13:29,602
What is this place?

725
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:32,864
Do you have diabetes?

726
01:13:32,974 --> 01:13:37,343
I mean, is this some sort of,
I don't know, underground hospital
or what?

727
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:42,711
You're a very strong-willed young lady.

728
01:13:43,287 --> 01:13:46,620
- Cancer.
- You have cancer?

729
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,915
No, I am a Cancer.

730
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:52,695
I just want to know where I am
and what I'm doing here.

731
01:14:06,379 --> 01:14:09,610
Oops. Oh, gosh.
Could you hand me that arterial...

732
01:14:09,717 --> 01:14:10,877
Got it.

733
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,294
Well, it's up to the respirators now.

734
01:14:21,797 --> 01:14:23,264
Why don't we prep the children?

735
01:14:23,365 --> 01:14:26,493
When we're finished with them,
we can start on that girl.

736
01:14:26,736 --> 01:14:29,705
They're so cute.
I love working with kids.

737
01:14:30,106 --> 01:14:32,802
Yeah. Don't forget the lights.

738
01:14:37,949 --> 01:14:40,179
Are you taking any medication?

739
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:49,727
Have you had any medication
within the last 24 hours?

740
01:14:51,864 --> 01:14:53,798
Where's my sister?

741
01:14:57,604 --> 01:14:59,731
Dr. Carter, may I see you a moment?

742
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:03,006
All right.

743
01:15:03,111 --> 01:15:05,204
I mean, she should be here by now,
shouldn't she,

744
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:06,838
even if Hector didn't show up?

745
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:09,884
Your sister’s dead.

746
01:15:12,756 --> 01:15:16,089
- What?
- I realize this comes as a shock,

747
01:15:16,961 --> 01:15:20,657
but she had been exposed, and in 48 hours
she would have died anyway.

748
01:15:21,732 --> 01:15:24,200
It was quite painless,
I can assure you.

749
01:15:32,078 --> 01:15:34,410
You both have nice, strong hearts.

750
01:15:34,514 --> 01:15:37,244
- Are we going to get shots?
- No.

751
01:15:37,584 --> 01:15:40,109
No shots. I promise.

752
01:15:40,654 --> 01:15:42,315
- Audrey?
- They're not back yet.

753
01:15:42,423 --> 01:15:44,948
Listen, we may have a situation
on our hands here.

754
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,961
I can't locate Rogers
anyplace in the compound.

755
01:15:49,732 --> 01:15:54,031
I can't rule out the possibility that
he may already have gone into transition.

756
01:15:56,839 --> 01:15:58,602
We can't wait for Audrey.

757
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:01,772
You're gonna have to start
with the children and that one in there.

758
01:16:01,878 --> 01:16:04,278
We need blood to develop the serum.

759
01:16:04,381 --> 01:16:06,849
We don't have enough for everyone.

760
01:16:08,419 --> 01:16:12,719
We're not robots, Doctor. We're not
all going to fall over at one time.

761
01:16:12,825 --> 01:16:14,725
Some of us will last a little longer.

762
01:16:14,827 --> 01:16:17,887
While others of us
have more immediate needs.

763
01:16:18,164 --> 01:16:20,724
You're smart.
You can figure that out.

764
01:16:20,834 --> 01:16:22,858
Psychology is not an exact science,

765
01:16:22,969 --> 01:16:26,405
but, my God, man,
anybody can add two and two.

766
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:35,675
I'm very sorry about your sister.
It's a tragedy.

767
01:16:36,351 --> 01:16:37,978
It truly is.

768
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:47,228
And I can understand your hostility.

769
01:16:47,331 --> 01:16:48,958
But no matter how upset you are,

770
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:52,866
breaking an expensive piece
of equipment won't solve anything.

771
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:57,067
I mean, striking out at inanimate objects
is really quite childish.

772
01:16:57,709 --> 01:17:00,075
Even you should be able to realize that.

773
01:17:03,182 --> 01:17:04,149
Jerk.

774
01:17:33,017 --> 01:17:35,281
Howdy, partner. How you doing?

775
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:41,118
- Who are you?
- The name is Hec. Hec Gomez.

776
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:47,596
Hey, them's real fine duds you got there.
You a Maytag repairman?

777
01:17:48,635 --> 01:17:51,069
How did you find this place?

778
01:17:51,305 --> 01:17:54,535
Well ah, this lady back in LA sent me.

779
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:58,843
Hey, you been to LA lately?
It's cleaned out, man, I'm telling you.

780
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:02,645
Hey, come here.
I want to show you something. Come on.

781
01:18:04,586 --> 01:18:08,022
Hey, you know how the harbor freeway
is always bumper to bumper?

782
01:18:08,123 --> 01:18:10,921
Well, you can go 150 miles an hour
if you want to.

783
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:13,290
Me and this baby,

784
01:18:13,396 --> 01:18:16,923
we go through them freeways
like turkey crap through a tin horn.

785
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:23,364
Hey...

786
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,401
You like girls?

787
01:18:29,948 --> 01:18:33,384
Look in here.

788
01:18:36,756 --> 01:18:39,020
- She's dead.
- She ain't dead.

789
01:18:39,293 --> 01:18:41,420
See, this lady shot her up
with sodium pentothal

790
01:18:41,529 --> 01:18:44,020
to make this fellow think
she was dead,

791
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:50,899
So you wouldn't suck her blood out,
you asshole.

792
01:18:54,777 --> 01:18:56,677
Son of a bitch!

793
01:18:58,848 --> 01:18:59,815
Shit!

794
01:19:10,128 --> 01:19:11,823
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

795
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,826
<i>I'm afraid our adolescent guest
has escaped.</i>

796
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,862
<i>She's quite hostile.</i>

797
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:18,435
<i>She may have already gone topside,</i>

798
01:19:18,538 --> 01:19:21,302
<i>so please take a moment
and look around you.</i>

799
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:47,996
Check those rooms,
and I'll check this one.

800
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,835
Let's go.

801
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:57,249
- Everything is under control.
- Good.

802
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,747
You said no shots.

803
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:31,188
This isn't a shot, sweetheart.
It'll just...

804
01:22:32,727 --> 01:22:34,058
You'll just giggle

805
01:22:34,163 --> 01:22:35,994
and then you'll feel a little sleepy.

806
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:37,656
That's right.

807
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:40,064
And when you wake up,
do you know where you'll be?

808
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:43,333
- Where?
- With Santa Claus at the North Pole.

809
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:47,375
In fact, you'll live with Santa Claus
for the rest of your life.

810
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:50,171
Hey, there's no such thing as Santa Claus.

811
01:22:50,282 --> 01:22:54,582
What? You don't believe in Santa?

812
01:23:13,374 --> 01:23:15,365
Life support systems.

813
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:20,709
- Wilson, come with me.
- Keep an eye on her.

814
01:23:20,816 --> 01:23:22,807
Yes.
Now, Wilson!

815
01:23:23,854 --> 01:23:26,015
Forget the door. Turn off the alarm.

816
01:23:41,573 --> 01:23:43,268
I don't know.

817
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,776
My parents told me
never to breathe anything from strangers.

818
01:23:47,046 --> 01:23:48,013
Hey!

819
01:23:50,283 --> 01:23:52,114
Get your hands up.

820
01:23:58,058 --> 01:23:59,218
What are you guys doing?

821
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:04,161
They said if we breathe this, we could go
to the North Pole and see Santa Claus.

822
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:07,095
- That's so sick.
- Hey!

823
01:24:07,203 --> 01:24:09,603
- Holy shit!
- Whoa.

824
01:24:09,705 --> 01:24:11,798
- Sam?
- I give! I give!

825
01:24:12,342 --> 01:24:16,506
- They said you were dead.
- They were exaggerating totally.

826
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:21,212
- Hey, that's a great outfit.
- Thanks. Is that guy in the hallway dead?

827
01:24:22,253 --> 01:24:23,584
Don't.

828
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:36,266
Well?

829
01:24:40,374 --> 01:24:43,070
You can give up if you want to, Wilson.

830
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:49,609
But we still have the two children
and that girl.

831
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,384
I forgot my football.

832
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:55,787
- We'll get you another football.
- We'll get you a stadium.

833
01:24:57,828 --> 01:24:58,795
Now!

834
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:13,243
Get everybody topside, now!

835
01:25:13,346 --> 01:25:16,509
- What about them?
- Screw them.

836
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:25,181
Okay, kids. Going up.

837
01:25:26,361 --> 01:25:28,556
Put your hands down, kids.

838
01:25:28,696 --> 01:25:30,526
God, don't be so stupid.

839
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:45,076
- Come on, kids.
- Who are the kids?

840
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:46,705
- I'm Brian.
- I'm Sarah.

841
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:49,081
Yeah, and I'm Aunt Reg
and that's Aunt Sam

842
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:50,380
and that's Uncle Hector.

843
01:25:50,488 --> 01:25:52,615
- Can I have my bunny?
- In a minute.

844
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:55,352
- Beat feet, Uncle Hector.
- Uncle Hector?

845
01:25:55,527 --> 01:25:58,052
Hey, it's my bunny, you know.

846
01:26:05,872 --> 01:26:07,965
- Where have you been?
- Can we change this?

847
01:26:08,075 --> 01:26:11,567
- Arranging a hotfoot for your friends.
- I really hate this music.

848
01:26:11,678 --> 01:26:13,077
Give me a break!

849
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:17,877
- What are you doing?
- I'm not kidding.

850
01:26:17,986 --> 01:26:20,318
I get carsick without my bunny.

851
01:26:20,456 --> 01:26:24,688
- Come on, Reg. Give the kid the bunny.
- We've stopped. Why have we stopped?

852
01:26:24,795 --> 01:26:25,853
Son of a...

853
01:26:25,962 --> 01:26:27,657
Don't shoot them, you idiot.

854
01:26:27,764 --> 01:26:31,358
Okay, kids.
Cover your eyes for Uncle Hector.

855
01:26:33,737 --> 01:26:36,399
Hey! Think tank, huh?

856
01:26:37,241 --> 01:26:39,368
Look, couldn't we just, like, leave?

857
01:26:39,477 --> 01:26:41,172
Think over this.

858
01:26:42,414 --> 01:26:46,316
- We can get them. We have to get them.
- Hey, we'll be taking off now.

859
01:26:46,419 --> 01:26:49,286
Look us up at Chasen's.
We'll party down, huh?

860
01:26:49,923 --> 01:26:52,414
- Come on.
- Come on. This is fun.

861
01:26:53,327 --> 01:26:55,795
The kids would like to say goodbye.
It's been fun.

862
01:26:55,896 --> 01:26:57,955
Hope to see you around real soon.

863
01:27:00,435 --> 01:27:02,231
Is that gasoline I smell?

864
01:27:06,975 --> 01:27:08,636
Wait. Wait, don't! Don't!

865
01:27:32,705 --> 01:27:35,105
Wow. All right, Hector.

866
01:27:51,093 --> 01:27:53,789
Let go of her!

867
01:27:55,832 --> 01:27:56,958
Hector!

868
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:07,604
It's okay.

869
01:28:08,613 --> 01:28:12,447
I got you. It's all right. It's okay.

870
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:14,612
I got you. Shhhhhh.

871
01:28:57,904 --> 01:29:01,567
Okay, kids. Smile. Come on.

872
01:29:02,674 --> 01:29:05,643
God, you're so cute.
You're just so cute. Wait.

873
01:29:06,879 --> 01:29:10,337
Mr. Bunny needs to be in this picture, too.
So, okay, that's great.

874
01:29:10,451 --> 01:29:13,147
- Can I take this jacket off? It itches.
- No, you can't.

875
01:29:13,254 --> 01:29:14,846
I just want to take another picture.
all right?

876
01:29:14,956 --> 01:29:17,288
- Please?
- No. Now you just hold on to that.

877
01:29:17,392 --> 01:29:19,417
- Stay there, okay? Perfect.
- Oh, brother.

878
01:29:19,528 --> 01:29:24,465
- There's still a few zombies around.
- Don't slouch. And, Sarah, hold that.

879
01:29:27,004 --> 01:29:29,063
Smile.

880
01:29:30,341 --> 01:29:33,639
Did the flash go off?
You can't tell on these things.

881
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:37,612
Hey, if you're gonna throw
those guns away, can I have one?

882
01:29:40,885 --> 01:29:44,412
Don't look at me. I mean, I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

883
01:29:47,661 --> 01:29:49,492
Smile, Hec.

884
01:29:52,433 --> 01:29:53,866
Handsome.

885
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:58,037
Maybe I could be a nun or something.

886
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,538
I just love these pictures.

887
01:30:00,676 --> 01:30:02,837
You've only taken about 30 of them.

888
01:30:02,944 --> 01:30:04,740
You know, we're going to need
more film soon.

889
01:30:04,846 --> 01:30:06,609
- Let me straighten your tie.
- Okay.

890
01:30:06,715 --> 01:30:08,842
God, they look like the Brady Bunch.

891
01:30:10,486 --> 01:30:12,215
What are you waiting for?

892
01:30:12,689 --> 01:30:14,156
Can I see them?

893
01:30:14,258 --> 01:30:18,251
- We're waiting for the light to change.
- We do not cross against the light.

894
01:30:21,299 --> 01:30:24,427
Are you nuts, ‘Auntie’ Regina?

895
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:28,140
You may as well face the facts, Samantha.

896
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:32,301
The whole burden of civiIization
has fallen upon us.

897
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,875
What's that supposed to mean?

898
01:30:38,285 --> 01:30:41,015
It means we do not CROSS
against the light.

899
01:30:43,257 --> 01:30:45,225
That's totally stupid.

900
01:30:45,393 --> 01:30:50,330
There's nobody here. See?
We're talking ghost town!

901
01:30:58,642 --> 01:31:00,610
See what happens?

902
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:09,813
God. I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross
against the light like that.

903
01:31:12,557 --> 01:31:15,151
- Hey, you guys are survivors, too, huh?
- Thank you.

904
01:31:17,797 --> 01:31:21,289
- What?
- Nothing. Great car.

905
01:31:22,035 --> 01:31:24,697
Thanks. I have 23 of them.
You want to go for a ride?

906
01:31:24,805 --> 01:31:27,137
More than you know.

907
01:31:30,044 --> 01:31:32,308
We don't know anything about this guy.

908
01:31:32,615 --> 01:31:34,674
Where's he from? What's his name?

909
01:31:34,849 --> 01:31:38,148
- What's your name?
- Danny Mason Keener.

910
01:31:38,287 --> 01:31:40,255
Danny Mason Keener, okay?

911
01:31:41,457 --> 01:31:42,583
Yeah, all right.

912
01:31:42,692 --> 01:31:45,786
- Well, just be back by midnight, okay?
- Midnight?

913
01:31:46,963 --> 01:31:49,397
The burden of civilization is on us, okay?

914
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:52,834
Oh, yeah. Bitching, isn't it?
