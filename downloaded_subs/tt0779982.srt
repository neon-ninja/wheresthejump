1
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,979
Hold him there. Hold him there!

2
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:01,016
Hey!

3
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:11,332
Henry, we've got a bolter!

4
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:14,337
Henry, Tucker,
go get him!

5
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,170
Get down, hold him!

6
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,941
Hold him! Hold him!

7
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:28,349
Good boy, get down.
Get down!

8
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:32,351
Hold him. That's it.

9
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:36,384
Good on ya, boy.

10
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:38,417
Come on, Henry!

11
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,333
Henry had
a little lamb,

12
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,566
its fleece
was white as snow,

13
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:26,939
and everywhere that
Dudley went,

14
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:29,036
Henry was sure to go.

15
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,954
Mrs. Mac? They're coming
down for lunch soon.

16
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,828
Coming down,
Henry!

17
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,700
Dudley?

18
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,973
Dudley,
where are you, boy?

19
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,641
Dudley?

20
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,023
Dudley?

21
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,231
Dudley?

22
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,140
Dudley?

23
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:36,839
Come out of there,
Dudley.

24
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:48,486
Ahh! Ah!

25
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,770
Boys!

26
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:07,436
Angus, pull
your head in!

27
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,002
Henry?

28
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:12,105
Boys.

29
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:16,649
It's your father.

30
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:19,018
There's been
an accident.

31
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:54,917
City boy, eh?

32
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,589
- No, I grew up on a farm.
- Oh, me too.

33
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:04,226
- Oh.
- You all right, my friend?

34
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,701
- Need some fresh air?
- Close it. Close it!

35
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,209
Dr. Carey's office.

36
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,873
It's Henry Oldfield.
I need to speak with her.

37
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:20,382
She's in a session right now.
Can I have her call you?

38
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,646
Please, please.

39
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:25,921
Nothing like it, eh?

40
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:29,618
God's green earth.
"All creatures great and small."

41
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,555
There we go.

42
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:09,120
- Okay.
- This way.

43
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:14,631
This isn't gonna be like
the salmon farm, is it, Grant?

44
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:17,731
Hey, those fish
died free.

45
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:22,878
- Come on, possum.
- Shh shh.

46
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,073
What's that?

47
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:35,450
Angus fucking Oldfield.

48
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,943
You'll wait
for me, right?

49
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:34,973
It's your money.

50
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,735
Hello?

51
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:04,236
Hello?

52
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:50,824
Unless you fancy nostrils
in the back of your head,

53
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,852
I'd not be moving
if I were you.

54
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,591
Mrs. Mac.

55
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:02,294
Bugger me days!
Henry!

56
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:04,329
Oh! Oh.

57
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:10,235
Oh don't worry.

58
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,442
I haven't shot anyone since Christmas.

59
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:16,680
Oh, just wait until
your brother sees you.

60
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,947
Yeah.

61
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:22,447
The Merino,
the Romney, the Drysdale...

62
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,687
these names are
whispered in the winds

63
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,787
that caress
the rugged hills.

64
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,354
These names are shared

65
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,629
in corners of
the farmyard,

66
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,603
and these are the names the
young men of the land recite

67
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:37,663
as they take themselves
off at night.

68
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:40,972
But in the future,
they will whisper

69
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,308
just one name...

70
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:52,177
the Oldfield.

71
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,048
Now you take it down

72
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,583
and lead it round in
front of the guests. That's it.

73
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,290
Stop so they
can touch it,

74
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,230
slap a flank,
feel the wool.

75
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:06,827
I'll take the other microphone,
give it to anyone else who...

76
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,666
has a question.

77
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:10,399
Get a prospectus
on every seat,

78
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,772
then go up the hill
and get the animal.

79
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:15,710
What are you doing here?

80
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,940
Lawyers have this
under control, don't they?

81
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,880
What am I doing here?

82
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,851
Our family's been here
for over 100 years.

83
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,084
Our father
was born here.

84
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:29,921
Our mother died giving
birth to me here.

85
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,450
This is where I spent
the first 10 years of my life.

86
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,561
And my therapist
said I should come.

87
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:43,060
Therapy.

88
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:46,040
- So you're still funny about the sheep.
- It's not about the sheep.

89
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,940
It's about other issues
I need to resolve.

90
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:49,740
Okay.

91
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:55,047
Angus.

92
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,780
Go inside.
I'll cut you a check.

93
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,526
That must be the laboratory.

94
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,158
Careful.

95
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,429
There you go.

96
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:15,437
- Okay.
- Astrid Rush.

97
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:18,736
Who'd hire her after
the thing with the leeches?

98
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:26,973
- You're end?
- Come and give a hand here.

99
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,685
Careful!

100
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,552
Grant!

101
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,183
- Up, up more...
- Shit.

102
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:50,205
Yeah, baby, yeah!

103
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,867
Go after him!

104
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:57,004
Oi!

105
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,677
- Whooo!
- Hey wait!

106
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:18,660
They'll never catch us.
They're meat eaters.

107
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,828
Okay.

108
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,861
- What was one, Grant?
- What?

109
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,805
Um, get in
unobserved.

110
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,774
Right.
And what was two?

111
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,902
- Collect visual evidence.
- Right.

112
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:30,344
Three?

113
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,506
- Get out unobserved?
- Yeah.

114
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:34,140
And four?

115
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:35,650
Blow this whole
fucking game wide open;

116
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,846
Take the bastard under
and go down in history

117
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:40,014
as the two people with
enough balls to save this country

118
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:42,024
from genetically-
engineered devastation!

119
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:44,492
No, Grant.
Four was a have a meeting

120
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:45,892
about what to do next.

121
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,226
This is evidence, okay?
It's evidence.

122
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:53,762
Actually, that's probably
highly-toxic genetic material.

123
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:55,270
Fuckin' A!

124
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:57,738
Fuckin' A. And it's mine.

125
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:59,570
Or, it's ours.

126
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:02,203
You and me, baby,
all the way.

127
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:04,804
Yeah, Grant.

128
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,974
About the you
and me bit...

129
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:10,543
Now I wonder if
our relationship hasn't kind of got...

130
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,146
Shh!

131
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:16,249
They're in
here somewhere.

132
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,624
- Go!
- Grant, wait.

133
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,492
There he goes!

134
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,291
Oi!

135
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,071
Whoa!

136
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,315
Over there!

137
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:46,048
Where is he?

138
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:48,613
- Bugger!
- Oh fuck.

139
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,237
Right.

140
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:41,140
That's for me.

141
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:43,202
And that's for you.

142
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,543
It'll buy you
a lot of therapy.

143
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:50,277
Well, there's not
much around here

144
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,219
in the way of your
cappuccino culture,

145
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:54,119
but I'm sure Mrs. Mac
will do you a cup of tea

146
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:56,624
and an Anzac biscuit
for the road.

147
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,286
That's it, then.

148
00:16:01,597 --> 00:16:03,963
You got rid of
all Dad's things.

149
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,365
Living in the past...

150
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,734
that's what's wrong with
these bloody farmers.

151
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:11,103
You're now the owner
of the biggest farm in the district.

152
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,937
What does that make you?

153
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:15,603
Up here's where the smart farming's
done these days, Henry.

154
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:17,908
Is that what all that
outside's in aid of?

155
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:25,477
People are interested in
what I'm doing here, Henry.

156
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:27,318
It's a whole new
approach to farming.

157
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:29,984
It's better for the animals,
better for the farmers,

158
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:32,084
better for the consumer.

159
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:35,461
It's an exciting time to
be in agricultural sciences.

160
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,562
And a profitable one.

161
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,992
More tea, Henry?

162
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:07,723
I think three's enough.

163
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,196
I should get going.

164
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,860
That's a pity.
You'll miss my rabbit pie.

165
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:15,769
I'm making watercress
for the Japanese.

166
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,773
Look, chopsticks.

167
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,275
He's quite the lord
of the manor now, isn't he?

168
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,799
Uh...

169
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,836
Angus was throwing
this away.

170
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:30,585
I know your father would
have wanted you to have it.

171
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,878
The Golden Shears.

172
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:36,391
Best shearer in the country

173
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,950
three years running.

174
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,087
Your father said you
were a natural too.

175
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,260
I... I really can't
see it on my coffee table.

176
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:49,897
You got what
you came for then?

177
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:52,407
Angus has
got his deal.

178
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,008
Guess I'm done here.

179
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:59,811
I'm having the farm manager take you
for a run up to the top.

180
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:02,682
But I haven't been
up there since the accident.

181
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:05,653
I know.
That's why you're going.

182
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:08,620
Oh, here he is now.

183
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:14,254
- Kia ora, Auntie.
- Tucker.

184
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:18,585
Flash threads, bro.
So you a model now or something?

185
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:20,618
I'm doing I.T.
Internet stuff.

186
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,893
Oh. Nude modeling.

187
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:25,628
And you're manager now?

188
00:19:25,668 --> 00:19:28,660
Well, your brother's hardly young
farmer of the year, is he?

189
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:30,899
Angus seems to think he's
got a handle on things.

190
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,568
The only thing he's
got a handle on is his...

191
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,780
Okay, farm boy,
let's see your stuff.

192
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:48,016
Sure.

193
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:49,957
Okay.

194
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:53,220
Come on.

195
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,162
Yah!

196
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,601
What happened to you,
darling?

197
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:12,808
Give us a hand, bro!

198
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:15,078
I... I just need
to make a phone call.

199
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:16,448
Jesus, man.

200
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,476
Just gonna shove her
back over the fence.

201
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:31,594
Hey!

202
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:35,397
- Hands up?
- Hands up!

203
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,314
It's okay.
It's okay.

204
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:54,515
I'll protect you.

205
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,190
Grant!

206
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:11,830
Grant?

207
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:18,946
Is this gonna take long?
Because I've got a taxi waiting.

208
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:20,676
If you fascists
have hurt him,

209
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:23,651
I will organize the biggest
sit-in this farm has ever seen.

210
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:28,886
Look, we don't know
where your friend is, okay?

211
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:31,654
- Maybe my brother could help?
- Brother?

212
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:33,354
Angus Oldfield.

213
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:34,987
I should have known
you were an Oldfield.

214
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,622
I can see it
in your aura.

215
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:38,895
I think that was just something
he stepped in back there, eh?

216
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,334
- No, you have a very selfish aura.
- What?

217
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,600
How would you like a taste
of what you're dishing out?

218
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,732
Safety's on.

219
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:48,208
- What?
- The safety's on.

220
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:50,040
Just...

221
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,569
yeah, on the other side.

222
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:53,706
Back a bit.

223
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:55,580
And down.

224
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,482
Back and down.
Up.

225
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,488
Here here, here.

226
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:03,748
Yeah.

227
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,226
There we go, here.

228
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,422
Yeah, right.

229
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,768
...they were like,
looking around at us and...

230
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,256
What about me?

231
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:13,794
Can we give you
a ride somewhere?

232
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:15,888
Maybe to the car
so I can, um...

233
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:17,660
Organize your sit-in?

234
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:21,396
Wait for my...
for Grant.

235
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,961
I'm Henry, this is Tucker.
What's your name?

236
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:26,873
- Experience.
- Has been so far.

237
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,941
So why were you
going to shoot me, Experience?

238
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:32,446
Because this farm subjects
innocent animals

239
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:34,779
to cruel and sadistic
torture. Because...

240
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:37,649
Smoke.

241
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,535
- You coming?
- Um...

242
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:15,082
Mike?

243
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:16,647
Mike!

244
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:28,195
Oh my God.

245
00:24:28,237 --> 00:24:29,898
What?

246
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,570
The feng shui
in this room is terrible.

247
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,276
Anyone there?

248
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:46,081
Mike?

249
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,528
Oh God.

250
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:15,108
Jesus, man,
it's not gonna bite.

251
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,880
- What's it doing?
- What is wrong with you?

252
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,855
- Ovinophobia, my therapist calls it.
- What's that?

253
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,949
Just a completely
unfounded and irrational fear

254
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:26,187
that one day
this is gonna happen!

255
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:30,027
Well, this happens when
you run the most reckless

256
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:32,192
genetic engineering program
in the southern hemisphere.

257
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:34,202
- Who engineered that?
- Your brother.

258
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:46,209
Mike.

259
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:53,686
Come on then,
muttonchops!

260
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:57,221
Bugger me.

261
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:09,965
Shoot it again!

262
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:17,504
That'll give you something
to talk to your therapist about.

263
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:21,004
Oh, I'm going to be sick!

264
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:41,994
Oh shit.

265
00:26:42,037 --> 00:26:44,028
Oh shit.

266
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,869
Kia ora.

267
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:49,638
Kia ora, kia ora.

268
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,839
Rattle your dags,
Henry!

269
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,416
There we go.

270
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:02,218
Good girls.

271
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:05,552
They're fine.

272
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:07,858
You get Henry. I'll start the car.

273
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,598
God, your chi
is in shambles.

274
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:16,297
Huh?

275
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:18,602
Take a deep breath.

276
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:24,105
You need
to ground yourself.

277
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:27,206
You're a tree.

278
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:32,078
Come on.

279
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,111
A tree.

280
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:37,922
Your taproot extends
down into the earth.

281
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,484
My... my what?

282
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,156
That's your base
chakra.

283
00:27:42,197 --> 00:27:45,860
Feel the energy drawing
out of the soil.

284
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,634
Can you feel it?

285
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:53,232
Yeah.

286
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:55,106
- Really?
- Yeah.

287
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:57,976
Come on, Henry.

288
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,345
The energy flows up

289
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:01,679
into your navel chakra,

290
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:03,809
your solar plexus
chakra,

291
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:06,047
into your heart chakra.

292
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:08,647
It spreads
to your branches,

293
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,386
your twigs, your leaves.

294
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:13,621
You are a mighty kauri

295
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:15,493
commanding the forest.

296
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,296
Look with
your third eye.

297
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:22,030
Totally relaxed.

298
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,130
Totally relaxed.

299
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:28,506
Get on the fucking truck!

300
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:31,341
Nearly there, nearly there.

301
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,979
Go!
Go go go!

302
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:42,683
Watch out for the sheep!

303
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:45,557
Shoot!
Sorry.

304
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:50,889
What the hell's he doing?

305
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:07,380
Chainsaw.

306
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,358
Is it turned on?

307
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,762
- Prime it, prime it!
- What?

308
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,926
The pump thing.

309
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,743
Fuck!

310
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:55,019
Oi, Henry!

311
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:04,500
- Are you okay?
- If it weren't for my gumboot...

312
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,767
Who's driving?

313
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,302
- Jump!
- What?

314
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,746
Jump off, now!

315
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:15,875
Jump off! Ah!

316
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:43,306
Oh, shit.

317
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,707
Wow, what a beautiful view.

318
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,550
- This is, uh, where...
- I know.

319
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:57,023
This is what?

320
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:59,925
Ooh, long way down.

321
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:02,892
I wouldn't want
to fall off there.

322
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:06,162
This is where my father
fell to his death.

323
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:07,725
Oh.

324
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,532
Sorry...

325
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:11,562
to hear that.

326
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:14,200
Oh, a sheep!

327
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:16,233
Is that a good one
or a bad one?

328
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:20,740
Oh, definitely bad.

329
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:23,717
That's not funny.
Animal flatulence is responsible

330
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:25,947
for almost half the world's
greenhouse gas emissions.

331
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:28,455
It's pure methane.
The Kyoto Protocol...

332
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,118
Kyahhh!

333
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:35,088
What do we do?

334
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,098
Well, reducing carbon
emission from industries...

335
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,930
No, what do we do about
raising the alarm?

336
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:41,799
My phone...

337
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,804
is in the truck.

338
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,396
Tucker,
what do you think?

339
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,568
Hoof it for the house.
Tell his lordship what's going on.

340
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,134
Is it far?

341
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:52,806
It's rough terrain,
open paddocks, hot day, no cover.

342
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:54,144
Yeah, I'd say
it's pretty far.

343
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:56,480
With about 50,000 sheep
in between.

344
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:57,985
Then what?

345
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,045
Then I get as far
away from here as I can.

346
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:04,287
You're still leaving?

347
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:06,919
I'm especially leaving.

348
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:11,159
Oh, what if the sheep
get down there before us?

349
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:14,635
Then Angus is gonna have
some unexpected visitors.

350
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,931
Henry.

351
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:51,801
Well?

352
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,501
No sign of him.

353
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,476
The others have gone
out into the paddocks.

354
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:00,010
You cannot make a cup
of tea in this country

355
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:03,381
without some do-gooder starting
a petition to have you do it their way.

356
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:06,616
You help me in the lab.

357
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:09,316
And you,
get rid of that stuff.

358
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:41,255
Bloody animals.

359
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:26,827
You and your...
your bloody 4-wheel drives.

360
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:29,098
Think you own the road!

361
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,739
I do, actually.

362
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:37,938
Angus Oldfield.

363
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:40,914
What hole
did you crawl out of?

364
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,918
WEKA. The Whole Earth
Kollective Aotearoa.

365
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,745
I know all about
your Frankensheep!

366
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:51,452
Mother Nature spent millions
of years making sheep.

367
00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:53,426
She doesn't need your help!

368
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:55,429
Don't talk to me
about nature.

369
00:34:55,463 --> 00:34:57,454
Man made sheep
what they are today,

370
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,466
and I'm making them
what they'll be tomorrow.

371
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,400
If I was a sheep, I wouldn't
be anywhere near you!

372
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:04,564
If you were a sheep, I'd have you ground
up for dog food, you little worm.

373
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:06,631
Now get the fuck off my land.

374
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:09,871
Ahh!

375
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:45,969
They might come from anywhere.

376
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:48,539
And they might not.
Calm down, bro.

377
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:53,551
So this guy you're looking for,
is he your boyfriend?

378
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:55,556
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

379
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,683
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Grant's part of our collective.

380
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:00,091
We're a non-profit cooperative
that shares information

381
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,153
and resources about
environmental issues.

382
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:03,925
So what were you and your
boyfriend doing here today?

383
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:05,865
We keep hearing about
some cowboy lab

384
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,960
that's flushing every animal research
guideline down the toilet.

385
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,096
Scum like Astrid Rush
and your brother

386
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:12,970
need to answer to
somebody sometime.

387
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,840
For someone who likes animals,
you don't like people very much, do you?

388
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,845
I would have thought
that you of all people

389
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,608
would appreciate efforts
to deconstruct

390
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,877
the colonialist paternalistic
agrarian hierarchy

391
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:24,180
that disenfranchises
the Tangata Whenua

392
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:26,379
and erodes the natural
resources of Aotearoa.

393
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:28,981
Learn all that
at university, did ya,

394
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,820
before you dropped out?

395
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,452
I didn't drop out, thank you.
I just missed exams

396
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:36,292
while we were
occupying a poultry farm.

397
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:37,992
Anyway, that's none
of your business.

398
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:41,058
Are you okay?

399
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,670
Rescue Remedy?

400
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:50,940
I don't need rescuing.
I need Dettol and a sticking plaster.

401
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,447
No thanks.

402
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:56,882
Fine, suit yourself.

403
00:36:56,918 --> 00:37:00,115
Wait, we should stick together.

404
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,384
Tucker, I'm sorry.
It's my fault you got bitten.

405
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:08,156
Don't worry.

406
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:12,394
It'll be...
oh fuck!

407
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,526
I'll get a tetanus shot
when we get back.

408
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,503
- Clear it right up.
- But the sheep did that.

409
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:18,437
Then I'll get the vet
to have a look at it. It'll be fine.

410
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:26,375
Oh God.
Here they come.

411
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,712
- Don't wait for me!
- I'm not leaving you behind.

412
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,616
- What about the sheep?
- Well, fuck the sheep!

413
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:34,018
No time for that, bro!
Go go go!

414
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:51,861
- In here.
- Not in there.

415
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,567
Why not?
It's been here forever. It's empty.

416
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:56,372
- No it's not, bro.
- This is your brother's laboratory.

417
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:00,813
You got
a better idea?

418
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:03,578
Go home.
Get, go on!

419
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:07,447
Come on.

420
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:32,309
Did you know
about this?

421
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:35,179
I just thought they were playing with
sperm or something.

422
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,593
Oh God.

423
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,008
Stand back!

424
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:09,016
Do it.

425
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:13,878
Tucker?

426
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,583
Jesus, Henry, are you gonna shoot me
if I end up like that?

427
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,620
- You're trespassing.
- Taihoa, Bo Peep.

428
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:29,060
What is this?

429
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,162
I told you.
agricultural science.

430
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,231
This isn't science.
The sheep are revolting.

431
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:35,936
Aren't they?

432
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:39,140
- Now, Henry...
- Hey hey.

433
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,479
I'll take that as
your resignation.

434
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:44,451
Angus, what would Dad
say about all this?

435
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:47,045
He wouldn't say anything.
He'd be knee-deep in mud

436
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:48,783
with his hand up
a sheep's ass.

437
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:51,018
Your father was
10 times the farmer you are.

438
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:54,425
My father fell off a cliff
chasing a wool-blind ewe.

439
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,555
Angus, there's something wrong
with the sheep. They attacked us.

440
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,089
Oh nonsense.

441
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,500
Your brother's clearly one
of these lunatic greenies.

442
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:05,734
Tucker,
show them your foot.

443
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:09,238
Foot?

444
00:40:09,277 --> 00:40:13,236
Henry, I simply won't allow
you to disrupt things today.

445
00:40:13,281 --> 00:40:15,272
What are you going to
do about it, eh?

446
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:20,286
Whatever I have to.

447
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:22,084
Angus, are you nuts?

448
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:24,182
There's a lot riding
on this, Henry. I told you,

449
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:25,783
it's gonna be
very profitable.

450
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:28,317
Henry, get out of here. Do something!

451
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:30,353
Get out of here!

452
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:33,196
- What?
- Move your ass!

453
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:35,702
Henry, come on!

454
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,730
Stop!

455
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:00,452
This way!

456
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,176
In there!

457
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:31,214
Oh, what's down here?

458
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:45,197
Look at them, Angus!

459
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,968
Look at you.

460
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,307
The fifth generation farmer's son
who's scared of a few sheep.

461
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,437
You do need therapy.

462
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,913
Ah!

463
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:59,252
There's no deal, Angus.

464
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:04,057
We have a contract, Henry.
It's done.

465
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:06,025
Not with all this
going on.

466
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:10,290
- Ah!
- Henry!

467
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:12,526
Help me!

468
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:14,796
Help me, Angus!

469
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:19,003
Angus!

470
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:22,269
I'm your brother!

471
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:27,071
That's the thing
about farms, Henry,

472
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:28,911
accidents happen.

473
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:33,416
- Let me go.
- No. No.

474
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,067
Oh my God!

475
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:59,679
- Are you okay?
- I'll never be okay ever again.

476
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,782
- What's that?
- Geranium...

477
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:14,090
aroma therapy for uplift
and hormonal balance.

478
00:43:14,128 --> 00:43:16,790
Do your hormones
really need balancing?

479
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:19,026
Considering I've been
attacked

480
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:21,000
by genetically-
engineered monsters,

481
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:23,503
jumped off a moving vehicle,
been chased across a paddock,

482
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:26,870
dragged into a torture chamber, pulled
into a mountain of rotting flesh...

483
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:29,467
yes, my hormones
need fucking balancing.

484
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:37,043
- Working yet?
- Uplifting at any moment.

485
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:47,986
- Where are you going?
- There are caves near the woolshed.

486
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:49,928
If this is part
of the same system,

487
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,398
we can walk
right under the sheep.

488
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,925
Right.

489
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:13,577
All he had to do
was leave.

490
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:15,748
Why wouldn't he
do that?

491
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:30,893
What happened to those idiots
I sent to collect you?

492
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:01,863
That looks...
anomalous.

493
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:03,961
What it looks like

494
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,734
is the spontaneous cellular
transferral

495
00:45:06,774 --> 00:45:09,743
we've been trying to
achieve for months.

496
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:12,575
Or possibly not
so spontaneous.

497
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:13,944
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

498
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:16,506
He'll be out
for a while.

499
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,347
Where's your brother
and that girl?

500
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,717
Oh, don't worry.
They're gone.

501
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:22,654
Well, I don't know what
they're on about.

502
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,920
The sheep?
Really.

503
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:27,427
There's too many people
running around here today.

504
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:29,861
One of those greenies
bit me on my way up the hill.

505
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,592
- Bit you?
- Yeah.

506
00:45:31,632 --> 00:45:34,032
Looked like he hadn't
bathed for months.

507
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,597
Hm, you may
need a shot.

508
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:42,040
Well.
I want this place secured.

509
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:44,340
Yeah, I have something
I need to observe here,

510
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:46,107
but I'll be down
presently.

511
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:48,341
No. Stay here.

512
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:51,715
Stay here?
I need to present my work.

513
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:54,482
Look, the last thing I need is someone
with your reputation

514
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:56,513
prancing about
the place.

515
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:58,650
Oh, my reputation didn't
seem to bother you

516
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:01,422
when you needed someone
to kick-start this venture.

517
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:03,589
Or when you
wanted to pursue

518
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:06,691
some personal interests.

519
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:10,770
I was just coming up with solutions
that you hadn't thought of.

520
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:12,829
Now I'll send someone
up for the animal.

521
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,603
You lock this place down
and stay out of the way.

522
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:21,013
What about that shot?

523
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:24,142
Put a plaster on it.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

524
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:29,118
The amount of bad karma
your brother's generating,

525
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:31,590
he'll probably
come back as a sheep.

526
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:34,594
I don't want to think about
what Angus has been doing.

527
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:37,028
Using your father's legacy
as a testing ground

528
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:38,827
for vile experiments
on animals.

529
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:41,630
Experience.

530
00:46:41,669 --> 00:46:43,660
What was all that
about a deal?

531
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,001
Huh?

532
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,166
What are you here
for today?

533
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,641
I sold him my share
of the farm.

534
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:51,440
I thought if I could
come back here

535
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:54,879
and resolve things with him,
I could move on.

536
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:58,043
But these
are your roots.

537
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:09,312
There's something
in here.

538
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:11,473
There can't be.
Or they'd have to...

539
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:13,948
jump!

540
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:15,713
Come on!

541
00:47:18,622 --> 00:47:21,113
Shit!

542
00:47:22,158 --> 00:47:24,251
I have to
get out of here!

543
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:34,232
- Down here.
- No. No way.

544
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:36,205
If it's a way out,
we're there.

545
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,730
If it's not,
we're there forever.

546
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:43,812
You go first!

547
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,052
It shouldn't be too far.

548
00:47:50,086 --> 00:47:51,713
Keep moving.

549
00:47:55,058 --> 00:47:57,049
I can't.

550
00:47:58,595 --> 00:48:00,586
You can.

551
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,758
Look,
you're a tree.

552
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,702
- A tree.
- Feel your roots

553
00:48:07,737 --> 00:48:10,501
- in the ground. Feel your, um...
- Chakra.

554
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,337
- ... chakra...
- My base chakra.

555
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:13,740
...drawing energy
from the ground.

556
00:48:17,514 --> 00:48:18,981
Okay, I feel it.

557
00:48:19,015 --> 00:48:21,916
There.
You're relaxed.

558
00:48:21,952 --> 00:48:24,147
I'm relaxed.

559
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:27,486
Don't get too relaxed.

560
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:30,920
Go! Go!

561
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:38,593
- Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying!

562
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:46,437
- Don't stop!
- It's opening up!

563
00:48:52,315 --> 00:48:54,715
I'm stuck!

564
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,068
I was wrong
about your aura.

565
00:49:50,106 --> 00:49:51,334
Really?

566
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:53,934
I said it
was selfish, but...

567
00:49:53,977 --> 00:49:56,810
now I think it was
something you stepped in.

568
00:50:00,183 --> 00:50:02,048
This way.

569
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:07,881
"Address To A Haggis:

570
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:11,485
Fair fa' your honest,
sonsie face,

571
00:50:11,528 --> 00:50:14,258
Great chieftain o'
the pudding-race!

572
00:50:14,297 --> 00:50:17,391
Aboon them a' ye
take your place,

573
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:20,528
Painch tripe or thairm."

574
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:23,728
Oh hello, dear.

575
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:25,331
Did you see Henry
up the hill?

576
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,865
Uh, no.

577
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,878
No, I think
he's gone.

578
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:31,107
Oh?
Really?

579
00:50:31,147 --> 00:50:33,707
I thought he would have
at least said goodbye.

580
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,718
Well...

581
00:50:35,752 --> 00:50:38,050
you can't tell what
Henry will do,

582
00:50:38,088 --> 00:50:40,613
can you?

583
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,388
It's all his
bloody fault.

584
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,159
He had his money...
good money.

585
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:51,531
My money.
That little baaa-stard.

586
00:50:59,676 --> 00:51:02,110
Up here.

587
00:51:19,462 --> 00:51:21,794
This is how
I remember it.

588
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:26,158
It's beautiful.

589
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:32,933
We'd better hurry.

590
00:51:44,053 --> 00:51:46,419
What's that noise?

591
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,985
Somebody shearing.

592
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:31,291
Hello?

593
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,919
Oh God, no.

594
00:53:00,496 --> 00:53:02,862
Grant?

595
00:53:07,837 --> 00:53:10,601
Oh!

596
00:53:16,846 --> 00:53:19,337
What's happened
to you?

597
00:53:22,585 --> 00:53:26,112
Grant, it's me...
Experience.

598
00:53:32,695 --> 00:53:35,061
Hey!

599
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:48,102
Henry!

600
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:50,442
This way!

601
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,970
Come on!

602
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:11,328
Round here.

603
00:54:14,037 --> 00:54:15,971
- He's coming!
- Come on.

604
00:54:26,582 --> 00:54:28,607
Oh shit!

605
00:54:33,923 --> 00:54:36,391
Grant, what's that
on your face?

606
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:38,951
Is that blood?

607
00:54:41,864 --> 00:54:43,991
Have you been
eating meat, Grant?

608
00:54:45,902 --> 00:54:47,529
Was it even organic?

609
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,938
So, that's
your boyfriend?

610
00:55:00,983 --> 00:55:03,008
I knew you liked animals,
but I didn't think you...

611
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:05,452
He's not my boyfriend.

612
00:55:05,488 --> 00:55:07,888
Something must
have bitten him.

613
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:10,586
You mean...

614
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:12,856
like Tucker?

615
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:22,165
The amniotic fluid
should work

616
00:55:22,205 --> 00:55:25,265
as an attenuated vaccine
on the mutated cells.

617
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,877
What's going on?

618
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,549
- Tell me how you feel?
- Sore.

619
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:37,952
Itchy.
My... my skin feels really tight.

620
00:55:37,987 --> 00:55:41,115
Go on.

621
00:55:41,157 --> 00:55:44,615
No no no no no no no no.
No, wait.

622
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:55,329
All right,
thanks very much.

623
00:55:55,371 --> 00:55:57,601
Oh hello.
Thanks for coming.

624
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,971
Konnichiwa.

625
00:56:04,013 --> 00:56:05,844
We're about to kick off.

626
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:14,752
There's my girl.

627
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:51,791
Oh shit!

628
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:54,820
Angus won't be selling much sheep
if he turns into one, will he?

629
00:56:54,864 --> 00:56:57,628
He might need
that shot after all.

630
00:57:00,169 --> 00:57:02,535
You're a very lucky
young man,

631
00:57:02,572 --> 00:57:06,668
to be witness to
a new scientific frontier.

632
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:09,405
I have a small errand
to attend to,

633
00:57:09,445 --> 00:57:11,504
and then...

634
00:57:11,547 --> 00:57:13,742
I think we might try and replicate
the effect on you

635
00:57:13,783 --> 00:57:16,479
with some of
these cultures I have.

636
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:18,612
In the meantime,

637
00:57:18,654 --> 00:57:21,020
you rest up.

638
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:35,503
Konnichiwa,
güten tag,

639
00:57:35,538 --> 00:57:37,665
kia ora,
g'day.

640
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:42,940
This land was carved
from virgin bush

641
00:57:42,979 --> 00:57:47,109
by my great-great
grandfather more than...

642
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:51,513
100 years ago.

643
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:55,046
My family have sowed their seed
here since that time.

644
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,150
But now...

645
00:57:57,193 --> 00:58:00,526
I have a dream
for the future...

646
00:58:02,832 --> 00:58:05,767
a dream of sheep.

647
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:16,842
Oh.

648
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:31,553
The Merino,
the Romney,

649
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:33,585
the Drysdale.

650
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,692
Excuse me.

651
00:58:45,508 --> 00:58:48,375
It's not far.
It's just a quick trip

652
00:58:48,411 --> 00:58:50,345
through the trees.

653
00:59:24,246 --> 00:59:27,272
These names are shared
in corners of the farm...

654
00:59:29,652 --> 00:59:32,780
These...
these names are...

655
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:35,188
names...

656
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:43,526
Well, time to meet the star
of our show, I suppose.

657
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:46,967
I give you
the Oldfield.

658
00:59:55,411 --> 00:59:57,072
It's beautiful.

659
01:00:05,187 --> 01:00:09,248
Quiet down.

660
01:00:13,129 --> 01:00:15,723
Ah, beautiful.

661
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:29,634
Quiet now.
Quiet, my pretty.

662
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,825
Oh no.

663
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:08,940
Perhaps it won't
be that bad.

664
01:01:25,835 --> 01:01:28,497
Easy! Easy!

665
01:01:28,537 --> 01:01:30,801
Easy!

666
01:01:34,076 --> 01:01:37,170
Oh!

667
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:42,183
"Lo, on Mount Zion
stood the lamb,

668
01:01:42,218 --> 01:01:44,277
and with him,
144,000."

669
01:02:23,058 --> 01:02:25,754
But I'm a vegetarian!

670
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:29,322
Was, was, was!

671
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,700
"It is these who follow
the lamb wherever he goes,

672
01:02:34,737 --> 01:02:37,865
for they are spotless!"

673
01:02:37,907 --> 01:02:41,104
- Help me! Help me!
- Ew! Get off!

674
01:02:41,143 --> 01:02:43,407
Help me!

675
01:02:49,718 --> 01:02:52,346
Take me up, O Lord!
Take me...

676
01:02:56,492 --> 01:02:59,893
Henry!
Just in time for dinner!

677
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:05,290
Oh my Lord!

678
01:03:05,334 --> 01:03:07,097
Oh!

679
01:03:10,739 --> 01:03:12,900
Yeah!

680
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:30,187
Easy, easy.

681
01:03:30,226 --> 01:03:32,160
That's my girl.

682
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:34,219
It's okay.

683
01:03:36,398 --> 01:03:39,424
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

684
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:49,575
There, it's... I know.
It's okay, yes.

685
01:03:49,612 --> 01:03:51,739
I know, it's okay.

686
01:04:02,825 --> 01:04:04,656
Let's make
that phone call.

687
01:04:04,693 --> 01:04:06,627
I think MAF,
then WEKA.

688
01:04:06,662 --> 01:04:07,993
Or WEKA
then MAF.

689
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,726
Someone must have one of the other
phones off the hook.

690
01:04:10,766 --> 01:04:13,132
Who else is in the...

691
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:21,173
- Your boyfriend's back.
- Jesus, Grant.

692
01:04:23,913 --> 01:04:25,244
- Henry!
- Ow!

693
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:27,681
My shotgun's in the pantry!

694
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:32,652
Many's the meal I've made
of wethers like you.

695
01:04:32,688 --> 01:04:36,021
You don't scare me.

696
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:43,990
What is that?

697
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:47,696
My haggis!

698
01:04:50,706 --> 01:04:51,866
Shells!

699
01:05:07,456 --> 01:05:09,447
Shells!

700
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,548
No!

701
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:52,660
What did you do?

702
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:54,862
Ling gui ba fa.

703
01:05:54,903 --> 01:05:57,463
- Huh?
- Acupuncture point.

704
01:05:57,506 --> 01:05:59,667
Causes temporary
paralysis.

705
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,142
Or coma
if I did it wrong.

706
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:03,542
Did you?

707
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:05,740
He fell down,
didn't he?

708
01:06:40,849 --> 01:06:42,248
We're safe.

709
01:06:42,284 --> 01:06:44,514
We're trapped.

710
01:06:44,553 --> 01:06:47,181
Let's make that call.
Where's the other phone?

711
01:06:47,222 --> 01:06:49,622
Uh, Angus's study.

712
01:06:53,295 --> 01:06:55,422
- Locked!
- Here we are.

713
01:07:05,374 --> 01:07:06,898
You're alive.

714
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:11,980
I pulled it
from the wall.

715
01:07:12,014 --> 01:07:13,572
What?

716
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:16,345
I thought, just keep a lid on things
till it all blows over.

717
01:07:16,385 --> 01:07:19,013
Business community don't receive
this kind of situation very well.

718
01:07:19,054 --> 01:07:21,852
They probably won't receive
being eaten very well eith...

719
01:07:23,392 --> 01:07:25,792
What are you
doing in here?

720
01:07:27,196 --> 01:07:29,494
You wouldn't understand.

721
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:33,661
I understand you've got a pretty fucked
up idea of animal husbandry.

722
01:07:39,108 --> 01:07:40,735
I'm taking back the farm.

723
01:07:40,776 --> 01:07:42,403
Ah.

724
01:07:43,612 --> 01:07:47,013
Golden boy thinks
he can do better, does he?

725
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:48,607
You wouldn't know
where to start.

726
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:52,518
Jeez, Angus, I couldn't
do any worse than you.

727
01:07:54,189 --> 01:07:56,316
No, wait.

728
01:07:56,358 --> 01:07:58,952
It's... one of us.

729
01:07:58,994 --> 01:08:01,462
It's family.

730
01:08:01,497 --> 01:08:03,488
What?

731
01:08:03,532 --> 01:08:05,557
That's how we made
the advances...

732
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:07,569
human DNA.

733
01:08:07,603 --> 01:08:09,764
Mine.

734
01:08:09,805 --> 01:08:11,500
Ours.

735
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,940
You fucker.

736
01:08:13,976 --> 01:08:16,206
Well, it was more of
a sperm sample really.

737
01:08:16,245 --> 01:08:18,145
You wanker!

738
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,478
Necessity's the mother
of invention.

739
01:08:20,516 --> 01:08:22,177
You've been bitten.

740
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:25,778
It's nothing.
Just some hippy.

741
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:27,686
You'll become
one of them!

742
01:08:27,723 --> 01:08:30,453
- A hippy?
- No, Angus, one of them.

743
01:08:30,492 --> 01:08:32,221
Only worse.

744
01:08:32,261 --> 01:08:34,286
What are you
gonna do, Henry?

745
01:08:34,329 --> 01:08:36,297
Kill me?

746
01:08:36,331 --> 01:08:38,526
I'm your brother.

747
01:08:38,567 --> 01:08:41,161
They're almost in!

748
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:44,104
Upstairs, children!

749
01:08:44,139 --> 01:08:46,130
Well?

750
01:08:46,175 --> 01:08:49,201
The sheep are breaking in.
They'll tear you to pieces.

751
01:08:49,244 --> 01:08:51,974
Oh, I don't think so.

752
01:08:52,014 --> 01:08:55,040
Henry, hurry!

753
01:09:00,155 --> 01:09:04,182
Goodbye, Angus.

754
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:19,970
Henry!

755
01:09:20,008 --> 01:09:22,135
Come on, now!

756
01:09:48,537 --> 01:09:50,664
There's another fire
escape around the back.

757
01:09:50,706 --> 01:09:53,266
We can take Mrs. Mac's
car to town.

758
01:09:53,308 --> 01:09:54,832
Look.

759
01:09:54,876 --> 01:09:57,936
Now where does he think he's going?

760
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,211
The barn.
His plane.

761
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,742
He can't leave if he's contaminated.
It could affect the whole country.

762
01:10:04,786 --> 01:10:07,186
You're hurt, dear.

763
01:10:07,222 --> 01:10:08,951
Grant.

764
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:11,789
We don't know
what will happen.

765
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:14,557
- We've seen what happens!
- Stay calm.

766
01:10:14,596 --> 01:10:16,120
You're a tree.

767
01:10:16,164 --> 01:10:19,622
I'm not a tree!
I'm a fucking sheep.

768
01:10:19,668 --> 01:10:22,796
No, you're a man.

769
01:10:22,838 --> 01:10:25,636
And your father'd
be proud of you.

770
01:10:40,956 --> 01:10:42,253
Come on.

771
01:10:47,863 --> 01:10:50,058
You two go.
I'm staying here.

772
01:10:50,098 --> 01:10:51,895
What are you
gonna do?

773
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:54,026
I'm gonna stop Angus.

774
01:11:03,779 --> 01:11:05,974
If you see me again,
you might have to...

775
01:11:06,014 --> 01:11:07,743
No.

776
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,963
I still smell, right?

777
01:11:26,001 --> 01:11:29,129
No, that's just
your aura.

778
01:11:31,907 --> 01:11:33,841
How will you get
across the lawn?

779
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:37,140
You don't have a hoof like Angus,
they'll tear you to bits.

780
01:11:40,982 --> 01:11:42,540
I'll blend in.

781
01:12:01,837 --> 01:12:05,329
I am a sheep. I am a sheep.

782
01:12:47,682 --> 01:12:49,707
I am a sheep.

783
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:04,225
Wait.
You go to town.

784
01:13:04,266 --> 01:13:07,963
Show me how to use this
and I'll stay here.

785
01:13:08,003 --> 01:13:10,471
Have you ever fired
a gun before, dear?

786
01:13:10,505 --> 01:13:12,598
Well...

787
01:13:12,641 --> 01:13:14,632
not as such.

788
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:18,339
Aim and squeeze, dearie.
That's all there is to it.

789
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,814
Besides...

790
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:22,840
I'll talk you through it.

791
01:13:31,026 --> 01:13:33,824
You know, this hurts me
more than it hurts you.

792
01:13:36,665 --> 01:13:38,724
We'll make a farm girl
out of you yet.

793
01:14:07,896 --> 01:14:09,727
Come on.

794
01:14:10,732 --> 01:14:12,359
Come on, darling.

795
01:15:59,774 --> 01:16:02,140
Angus?

796
01:16:32,974 --> 01:16:36,569
Stop, Angus!
Look!

797
01:16:36,611 --> 01:16:38,272
We could have run
the farm together,

798
01:16:38,313 --> 01:16:39,678
if you hadn't
ruined everything!

799
01:16:39,714 --> 01:16:41,375
If you hadn't tried
to kill me!

800
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:43,543
Now it has to end.

801
01:17:58,727 --> 01:18:00,285
What?

802
01:18:18,646 --> 01:18:20,113
Come in.

803
01:18:21,983 --> 01:18:24,042
Speak up.

804
01:18:24,085 --> 01:18:26,781
Hold him, boy.

805
01:18:26,821 --> 01:18:28,686
Hold him.

806
01:18:28,723 --> 01:18:30,623
Hold him, boy.

807
01:18:32,694 --> 01:18:34,787
Get down.
Get down.

808
01:18:37,232 --> 01:18:39,632
Hold him.

809
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:48,303
Hold him, boy.

810
01:19:10,298 --> 01:19:11,731
What?

811
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:40,222
Tucker.
You're okay.

812
01:19:41,396 --> 01:19:42,886
Oh!

813
01:20:00,148 --> 01:20:01,581
What is that?

814
01:20:01,616 --> 01:20:04,346
Just a little something
I picked up in the lab.

815
01:20:04,385 --> 01:20:06,512
Should clear up your worms.
Fix your fly strike too.

816
01:20:24,606 --> 01:20:26,631
Anyway,
pull your finger out.

817
01:20:26,674 --> 01:20:28,642
We've got work to do.

818
01:20:32,847 --> 01:20:35,407
Hold 'em, Dice.
Hold 'em. Good dog.

819
01:20:43,324 --> 01:20:46,259
How much of
that stuff is there?

820
01:20:46,294 --> 01:20:48,387
Not enough for
all of them.

821
01:20:52,267 --> 01:20:54,497
Jeez!

822
01:20:58,806 --> 01:21:01,468
Angus, it's over.

823
01:21:01,509 --> 01:21:04,774
No, this is
just the beginning.

824
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,008
Come back!

825
01:21:09,117 --> 01:21:10,675
My babies.

826
01:21:10,718 --> 01:21:13,653
Have me again.

827
01:21:49,157 --> 01:21:50,715
Methane.

828
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,895
Get in behind!

829
01:22:26,728 --> 01:22:27,854
Last one.

830
01:22:27,895 --> 01:22:29,863
There's a nice bit of
wool on that, actually.

831
01:22:29,897 --> 01:22:32,798
- Reckon we should hang onto this one?
- He's a bit toey, but...

832
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:34,131
Could make good eating.

833
01:22:41,442 --> 01:22:43,637
This is for you.

834
01:22:47,648 --> 01:22:49,741
What do you reckon, boss?

835
01:22:49,784 --> 01:22:51,979
Organic farming?

836
01:22:55,256 --> 01:22:57,520
Nothing but trouble,
this modern stuff.

837
01:22:57,558 --> 01:23:00,026
Better just to stick with the way
we've always done things, eh?

838
01:23:04,932 --> 01:23:08,333
I've eaten a rabbit.

839
01:23:11,506 --> 01:23:13,736
Blanket, dear?

840
01:23:13,775 --> 01:23:16,903
Let's see how
we go, eh?

841
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:24,541
Snack?

842
01:23:24,585 --> 01:23:27,110
- What are they?
- Mountain oysters.

843
01:23:27,155 --> 01:23:29,555
Well, I do eat
a bit of seafood.

844
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:34,427
No.

845
01:23:34,462 --> 01:23:36,430
Mm, it's good.

846
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:38,762
Of course
it is, dear.

847
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:46,605
You know you're eating
sheep's balls, don't you?

848
01:23:48,776 --> 01:23:50,243
Don't waste it.

849
01:23:54,182 --> 01:23:56,673
They'll grow on you.

850
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,779
What is happening here?

851
01:24:01,823 --> 01:24:04,792
No seriously, you could
have an organic compost heap.

852
01:24:04,826 --> 01:24:06,726
Or a worm farm.
