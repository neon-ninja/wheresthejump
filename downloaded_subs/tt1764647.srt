1
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:45,718
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,345
Just watched a video
sent to me by a follower.

3
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:52,975
Hey, everybody. It's Jen and I wanted
to make this video in response to--

4
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,852
That sleep experiment video
that's on YouTube.

5
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,311
This-- this video of some strange
mad scientist guy.

6
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:02,317
Hungarian doctor doing,
you know, tests.

7
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:06,070
- Experimenting on students.
- Younger Asian male patients.

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,026
They have, like, wires
connected to their heads.

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,033
I don't know what to believe
on the Internet anymore.

10
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:12,693
What's going on, everybody?
It's your man, Alpha Cat.

11
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,362
Welcome to this episode
of "Ask Alpha Cat."

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,828
This crazy viral video that has gotten
thousands of views.

13
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:19,957
Apparently, it's this viral video
that's been going around the web.

14
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,993
- It's gotten tons of hits.
- Some people have also said

15
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:25,164
that this is related to, like,
a more recent rash of deaths.

16
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:28,300
Those deaths
over in Kentucky.

17
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,677
Some people say that
it's dangerous to watch it.

18
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:33,053
After watching it,
they start hallucinating.

19
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:36,010
It's kind of creepy. I'm not trying to
have some real-life "Ring" experience

20
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:37,345
where I watch something
and then I'm cursed.

21
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,180
- Bump that.
- It's pretty scary.

22
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:40,640
People just think I'm crazy.

23
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:43,601
- Obviously, this is fake, you guys.
- This is something real.

24
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:46,190
This video is creepy as hell.

25
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,898
Like, nobody knows
who uploaded the video.

26
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,903
We have no information.
We have nothing.

27
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:55,033
This is a video that wasn't
meant to get out.

28
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,700
I'd really like some answers.

29
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,371
Teng.

30
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,540
Teng?

31
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,878
Teng? Teng!

32
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:20,720
Teng! Teng!

33
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:29,769
Hi, Charlie.
My name's Alex.

34
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:32,400
- Long-time listener, first-time caller.
- Hey, Alex. What's up?

35
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,904
Well, there's this girl
and I really like her.

36
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:38,405
So go up to her,
start a conversation.

37
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,282
We really haven't met
in person yet.

38
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:42,864
We just Facebook each other,
but I thought it was starting

39
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,074
to get intense, and then
she stopped responding.

40
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,659
I remember hearing
a story about a girl

41
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,699
who fell in love with a guy
on one of these sites,

42
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:52,040
and when she found out that the guy
was actually one of her friends

43
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,249
playing a prank on her,
she killed herself.

44
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:55,584
Now, what does that tell you?

45
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:58,090
It tells me that the bullshit
we make up in our minds

46
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,467
can be dangerous.

47
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,049
It's got us living in a world
where we're falling in love

48
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:04,054
with ones and zeros,
with fake people,

49
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,135
when the real world
is just outside.

50
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,177
You know the thing
we still can't get online?

51
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:10,719
Chemistry.

52
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:13,139
That primordial thing,
that animal instinct

53
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,853
that draws us together.

54
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:17,938
And without that,
you got nothing.

55
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,900
Just a fake relationship
with a fake girl in a fake world,

56
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:24,065
with nothing to show for it
but real heartache.

57
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:26,404
So turn off your computer, Alex.

58
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,695
Go outside,
find yourself a real girl.

59
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,909
Good luck to you.
Next caller.

60
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,165
You're on KZTO's "The Night Shift"
with Charlie Crowe.

61
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,586
Hello?
Am I on-- on the air?

62
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,918
Yeah, you're on the air.

63
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,083
- My name's Jeff.
- Mm-hmm.

64
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:45,421
- Jeff, what's on your mind?
- I'm seeing things.

65
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:48,053
- What kind of things?
- Shadows.

66
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:49,804
Shadows of people
who aren't really there.

67
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,886
Oh, what,
you mean like ghosts?

68
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,428
No, they're not ghosts.
These are something else.

69
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:58,972
Uh, Jeff, no offense, but we get
a lot of interesting callers

70
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,482
on this show,
but this is not a nuthouse.

71
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,985
So please direct
all your local insanity

72
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:05,611
to your local psychiatrist.

73
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:08,649
And what do we say when people
waste our valuable air-time?

74
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:10,191
- We say...
- Thank you very much.

75
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:14,619
Well, that's about all the time we have
on "The Night Shift" with Charlie Crowe.

76
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,408
We have a ton of people on hold.
Thank you for trying.

77
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:20,621
Try again next time
when Charlie Crowe unveils

78
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:22,457
the mysteries
of the unknown universe.

79
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:23,996
We'll be back on Monday.

80
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:27,506
Until then, good night,
sleep tight,

81
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:29,417
and don't let the bedbugs bite.

82
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:34,009
- Big City Value Furniture...
- Any word from Philadelphia?

83
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:37,016
Uh, yeah, man. They're not looking
to syndicate us just now.

84
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:39,517
Maybe next year
if our numbers come up.

85
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:45,474
You know this is the worst
damn market I've ever worked in.

86
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,027
Night, Tom.

87
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:52,029
My name is Tom DiMartino.

88
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,531
I am producer and engineer
for "The Night Shift"

89
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:56,738
with Charlie Crowe on Z104.

90
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:59,949
Charlie got this slot
in the evenings

91
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:02,456
and needed
a producer/engineer person,

92
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:03,832
you know, somebody
to screen calls.

93
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:07,085
And so he said, "Hey, you know,
you've got some experience.

94
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,745
Would you be willing
to do this for me?"

95
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,084
You know,
I was game at the time.

96
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,691
Seemed like
a pretty good ole boy.

97
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,906
Last time I talked to him, anyway.

98
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,945
Like I said,
he leaves a good tip.

99
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,080
How many times
did he come in here?

100
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:50,583
Before or after 4:00?

101
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,161
That was a good show, Charlie.

102
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,081
Wish my programmers
thought so.

103
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,591
If they ever can your ass
over at that radio station,

104
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,423
you can come work for me.

105
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,837
No offense, Sparky, but...

106
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:08,183
I think I'd rather suck the end
of a double-barreled shotgun.

107
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:47,294
Hey there, kiddo.
What's the word?

108
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,804
Hey.

109
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:53,058
- How's Dr. Robert?
- He's fine, I'm fine.

110
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,220
Thanks for asking.

111
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,352
Maid's day off again?

112
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,936
Um, what are you doing?

113
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,021
- Checking your fridge.
- Why?

114
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:04,811
To see if you have anything healthy
to feed my son with.

115
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,570
Hey, that's still good.

116
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:15,863
It's expired.

117
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,999
You know, I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of our son.

118
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,251
- I don't like him eating junk food.
- Yeah, so we'll go out.

119
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,831
I don't Iike him
eating fast food either.

120
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,371
All right, then I'll have the butler
whip us up something.

121
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,381
Don't be cute, Charlie.
This is serious.

122
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:30,009
Can't I be cute and serious?

123
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,892
Don't you think you should stop
wearing that?

124
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:41,053
It's confusing Preston.

125
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:44,519
Well, maybe I don't like
throwing things away.

126
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:46,775
Clearly.

127
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:02,364
What about you, huh?

128
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,578
Is it better to throw something out
after you're tired of it?

129
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:08,085
Trade it in for something new
and shiny and rich?

130
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:11,544
I was impressed with the fact
that he took an interest in my son.

131
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:13,174
Hey, wait.
Hey, no.

132
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:15,209
I take an interest in Preston.

133
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:18,800
He just doesn't like
the same things I like.

134
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:21,590
Hey, Charlie.
How's the DJ business?

135
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,225
I'm not a DJ.
DJs spin records.

136
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:26,387
Lovely to see you.

137
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:42,572
So what do you
want to do?

138
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:45,408
- Nothing.
- Eh, come on.

139
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:47,789
Let's go out to the park.
We can throw the ball around.

140
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,577
Yeah, that would be fun...
if I was 10.

141
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:54,337
Oh, all right.

142
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,340
- What are you playing?
- Zombie Killer.

143
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,591
Yeah, that looks pretty violent.

144
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,423
Is that rated for adults
or something?

145
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,555
Yeah, but Robert
lets me play it, so...

146
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,262
Well, um, Robert
is not your father,

147
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,768
and I would prefer it
if you didn't sit around all day

148
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:10,928
looking at that garbage.

149
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,140
It'll rot your brain.

150
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,523
Yeah, you would know about garbage,
wouldn't you, Dad?

151
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,936
It's not garbage.
This is all perfectly plac--

152
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,732
- I need that there for later.
- Good.

153
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,288
Bed-time, buddy.

154
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,791
Do you want me to leave
that other light on for you?

155
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,455
Why, you think
I'm scared of the dark?

156
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,248
No. I'm sorry.

157
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:45,759
I just-- I-- you're growing up so fast.
I forget sometimes.

158
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,966
Since when do you care?

159
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,509
Since you were born, buddy.

160
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,598
Since you were born.

161
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:46,733
Preston, your mom's here.

162
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,479
- Have fun?
- No.

163
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:53,693
- You beat my high score?
- Yeah, look.

164
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,824
Yeah, I love you, too, kid.

165
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:55,210
Hey. So that kid from the other night,
the one with the shadows.

166
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,125
- Yeah?
- He drops a package off at my house

167
00:14:58,302 --> 00:14:59,963
filled with photos
and lab reports

168
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:02,719
of some crazy experiment
from Camden College.

169
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,256
- Well, you better make a copy.
- Why?

170
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:08,722
Because when the CIA confiscates it,
no one's gonna believe you.

171
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:11,432
No, man.
He's just some conspiracy nut.

172
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:14,268
Oh, please tell me you're not
buying into this crap.

173
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:17,775
No, you know, it's just something
interesting for the show.

174
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:21,985
Besides, you know, if my body
ends up in a dumpster,

175
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:24,113
it would probably
be good for ratings.

176
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,866
Yeah, actually,
speaking of ratings,

177
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:29,278
I talked
to programming today.

178
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:30,491
And?

179
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,997
They said if our numbers
don't come up,

180
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,159
they're gonna start running reruns
of Raunchy Paul in our slot.

181
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:37,418
Raunchy Paul?
You gotta be kidding me.

182
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,419
I wish I was, man,
but that's what they said.

183
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,251
Son of a bitch.

184
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,291
All right, we're on
in 10 seconds.

185
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,047
Now here he is,
the king of the late-night mic--

186
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,841
the one, the only

187
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,681
Charlie Crowe on your radio.

188
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:59,019
This is the tri-county
superstation KZTO,

189
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,649
and you're listening to
"The Night Shift" with Charlie Crowe.

190
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,276
Welcome, all you people
of the night,

191
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:08,235
all you maniacs, brainiacs,
and insomniacs who won't hit the sack.

192
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,900
Let's open up the phone lines
and hear what's on your mind.

193
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:13,194
First caller,
you're on the air.

194
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,658
Have you seen them yet,
Charlie?

195
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,288
Oh, it's Jeff.

196
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,915
I thought I might hear
from you again.

197
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,950
Did you get
the package I left you?

198
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,462
Mm-hmm, I did, Jeff.
That is some interesting stuff.

199
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:27,089
- What is it?
- I don't know.

200
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,171
I'm trying to figure that out,

201
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:32,336
but I'm afraid if I go to sleep,
I'll never wake up again.

202
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:35,176
Why exactly did you send me
that package, Jeff?

203
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,932
It's evidence.
I'm not crazy.

204
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:40,640
They come when you sleep.

205
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:44,056
Every night, I close my eyes
and they come.

206
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,977
And I'll wiggle my toe
or try and move my arms

207
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:52,147
just to wake myself up, but it's like
they don't want you to be awake.

208
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:55,237
Mm. Well, now you're starting
to worry me, Jeff.

209
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:57,697
How old are you?

210
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:59,827
- 17.
- 17, I see.

211
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:02,410
Are your parents around?
Can I talk to them?

212
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:05,872
My mom works nights.
I'm here alone.

213
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:09,379
Jeff, if you're afraid,
you should go to a friend's house

214
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:12,210
- or-- I don't know.
- I have a gun.

215
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:17,878
Uh, what do you need
a gun for?

216
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,673
You can't get away
from them.

217
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:23,012
Do you understand me?

218
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:24,393
It's your thoughts.

219
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:26,894
When you think about them,
that's how they find you.

220
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:29,977
It's like sharks drawn
to blood in water.

221
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,777
The only question is,

222
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,984
how do you stop thinking
about something?

223
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,947
Uh, Jeff, are you still with us?

224
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:46,906
- They're here.
- Okay.

225
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:48,790
Now, uh, just--
just calm down, Jeff.

226
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,577
I want you to call someone.

227
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,662
Uh...

228
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:58,337
Uh, let's-- let's just put
that gun down

229
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,967
and-- so we can talk,
because, Jeff,

230
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:02,423
I know that you are not crazy.

231
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:07,348
Jeff?

232
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,350
Jeff? Hello?

233
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,386
Yeah, we're gonna go
to a commercial break now

234
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:13,271
to, uh, make sure
everything's okay.

235
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,602
Now nobody panic.
This could be a hoax.

236
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:19,815
We will find Jeff and, uh,
make sure that he is all right.

237
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,856
Tired of that slow computer,
those inevitable crashes?

238
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,819
Save costly repairs
and downtime

239
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:27,861
with the best solution
to your problem...

240
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:31,617
And I've got a gun here.

241
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,282
Oh, listen, that's-- you know,
that's not the answer.

242
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,325
Is there, like, a friend or--

243
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:39,166
They're in the room right now.
I see them in the room right now.

244
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,796
- What-- who is in the room?
- Charlie...

245
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,582
Who's in the room?

246
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,796
Do you want me to call--
oh, my gosh.

247
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,177
Well, I'll tell you what.
Details are very sketchy at this point.

248
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,303
We arrived just about
a half hour ago

249
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:51,260
and we're told that
the radio host here

250
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:53,801
took a call from someone
right around 17 years old,

251
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,345
and that person through
the course of the conversation

252
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,138
is heard firing a weapon.

253
00:18:58,317 --> 00:18:59,727
We don't know if that person
fired a weapon,

254
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,982
we don't know if somebody else
in the room fired a weapon,

255
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:04,895
but a weapon was fired
live on the air.

256
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,747
He didn't kill himself.
He shot the wall.

257
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:20,033
His parents checked him
into a hospital.

258
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,827
Man, that had me
freaked out.

259
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,086
Yeah, me, too.

260
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:26,339
He wants to take
your statement now.

261
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:37,633
Hi, Officer.

262
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,803
People are already speculating
that the call may have been a hoax

263
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,266
in an attempt to boost
the ratings of the show.

264
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:46,808
Now, if that's true, host Charlie Crowe
may be in a bit of hot water.

265
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,352
We tried to speak to Mr. Crowe
following the broadcast,

266
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,645
but take a look
at what happened.

267
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,235
I didn't call him.
He called me, all right?

268
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,444
I've never met him.
I'm just an entertainer.

269
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,203
Now, if you'll please excuse me,
that's all I have to say about that.

270
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:01,034
- It's been a long night.
- Sir?

271
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,041
Mr. Crowe, are you gonna be
on the air tomorrow?

272
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:07,044
Do you have anything
to say to the family?

273
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:21,215
- Yeah?
- Hey, listen, Charlie.

274
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,929
You know, that thing
last night with the kid,

275
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,015
um, I really think this might be
the break that we need.

276
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,895
Our numbers are up this week.

277
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,227
I think people really respond
to this kind of real-life drama.

278
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:31,858
No, people think it's a stunt.

279
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:36,145
I had a reporter at the station
last night asking me about it.

280
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:37,608
I'll tell you what it is,
it's an opportunity.

281
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:39,614
And it's got a lot of people
talking about it.

282
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:42,822
Programmers think it's a good idea
and, actually, I think so, too,

283
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:45,487
if you go down to the hospital
and you talk to this kid.

284
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,907
- You know, meet him.
- No, no.

285
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:50,996
Oh, don't make me do that.
I'm not good with kids.

286
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,162
I-- I mean, come on,
especially if he's nuts.

287
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,706
No, no, listen. You go down
to the hospital, okay?

288
00:20:56,884 --> 00:21:00,047
You meet with the kid, you show
that the station is sympathetic,

289
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,678
and it's good PR, right?

290
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:05,555
Yeah, all right.

291
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:07,717
Good PR.

292
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:22,280
Hi, I'm looking
for a patient-- Jeff Pyatt.

293
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,111
He was admitted here.

294
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:29,116
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not here anymore.

295
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,781
He was transferred?

296
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,622
- He passed away in his sleep.
- He's dead?

297
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,502
- How did--
- We don't know yet.

298
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:42,006
They'll contact family
with the results after the autopsy.

299
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,542
You don't know how he died?

300
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,653
- Yeah?
- Hey, Charlie. Are you there?

301
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,814
Yeah.
The kid's dead, Tom.

302
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,482
They said he didn't
kill himself, though.

303
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,649
He didn't.

304
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:13,068
He died in his sleep just like
he said he was going to.

305
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:15,362
You're shitting me.

306
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,747
Do you know where
Camden College is?

307
00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:20,159
Yeah, it's just off 127.
Why?

308
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:21,702
Oh, no, don't tell me.

309
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,245
I thought you said
the kid was just nuts.

310
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:25,458
Well, then why did he die?

311
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,089
Please, Charlie.
You know what?

312
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:28,374
You're gonna end up
in the dumpster, man.

313
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:29,541
I'm tellin--

314
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:35,840
At the time that he actually--

315
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:38,100
when you-- what you--
pronounced dead,

316
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,349
yes, there was lots of people.

317
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:41,352
But when you actually say
it went down--

318
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:43,354
it's what we call, you know--
what they call coded--

319
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,061
nobody was there
at that moment.

320
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:47,191
There was nothing out of the ordinary
at his residence.

321
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:49,227
He seemed to be a healthy kid.

322
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:52,567
There is times that--
truly you say we missed that.

323
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:55,153
You know, I could name several--
of course, I won't--

324
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:57,659
but you think,
you know, this is--

325
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,697
we truly missed something,
but this time we did not.

326
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:04,207
I mean, this was not--
it was truly a mystery.

327
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:27,850
Hi there.

328
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:29,980
Hi. Can I help you?

329
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:31,891
Yeah, I was wondering
if there's a teacher here

330
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,400
named Dr. Ravenscroft.

331
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:34,856
Never heard of him.

332
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,395
Oh, okay.

333
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:39,862
Um, can you tell me where I could
look up information on someone,

334
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,947
Iike, scientific papers he might
have published, that kind of thing?

335
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,783
Right there.

336
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,322
Science periodicals.

337
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:47,614
But you're not allowed
to check them out

338
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,373
unless you're faculty
or a student.

339
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,409
Yeah, but I can make copies.

340
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:53,670
Not unless you're faculty
or a student.

341
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,711
Yeah, well, I'm neither.
Thank you very much.

342
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,342
Say that again.

343
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,388
- Thank you very much?
- Hey.

344
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,925
I'm sorry, but are you
on the radio?

345
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,264
I am, actually.

346
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:13,351
- Charlie Crowe, KZTO.
- "The Night Shift," yes.

347
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:15,355
I listen to your show
all the time.

348
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,437
It's the coolest.

349
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:20,570
And you have the sexiest voice.

350
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,483
Well, uh, thank you
very much.

351
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,572
You just don't really look the way
I imagined you would.

352
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,284
Yeah.
Thanks again.

353
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,289
Wait, question.

354
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,293
That kid on your show,
they say he died in the hospital.

355
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:39,671
- Is that true?
- Yeah, he did.

356
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:42,581
Freaky.

357
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,341
Yeah.

358
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:48,087
Well, I'll tell you what.

359
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,722
Go ahead and use the copiers.
I won't tell.

360
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:55,643
Shh.

361
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:49,398
Maggie, somebody jammed
the copier again.

362
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:11,881
This is KZTO's
"The Night Shift."

363
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,587
If you've been listening,

364
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,717
then you know we had
a rather dramatic incident

365
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:17,423
on the air the last time
I was with you,

366
00:26:17,597 --> 00:26:20,088
so tonight we're gonna
take some time

367
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:22,178
to talk about what's on
everybody's mind.

368
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:23,762
We'll open up the lines.

369
00:26:23,937 --> 00:26:26,144
Caller, you're on the air.

370
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:33,859
Hey, yo.

371
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,271
Hey, Maggie,
you gonna lock up?

372
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:37,985
I'm just finishing up
a couple things.

373
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,740
Good night, Carl.

374
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:53,308
- Mag!
- Jesus! Brit.

375
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:55,059
Jesus.

376
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,595
You scared the shit out of me.

377
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:59,230
Oh, my God, that was so funny.
I seriously just pissed.

378
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,233
Why did you do that?
I'm so freaked out right now.

379
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:05,110
- This kid just died.
- No, no, don't even tell me.

380
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,646
I don't Iike scary stories
because they give me nightmares.

381
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,737
But there is a huge party tonight
at the Sigma Chi house.

382
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:13,869
Everybody is gonna be there.
Please tell me you're coming with.

383
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,028
I have to study.

384
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:17,163
Oh, my God.
You never do anything.

385
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:18,994
And don't wake me up
when you get home.

386
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,999
I have an 8:00 a.m. class.

387
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:23,870
No promises.

388
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,340
I think the kid sounded
like he was on drugs.

389
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:31,423
I'm sorry he died and all,
but I think it's an overdose.

390
00:28:31,597 --> 00:28:33,382
I mean, I don't mess
with that stuff myself,

391
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:34,967
but I know people that do

392
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:36,598
and they sounded
just like that kid.

393
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:40,181
Okay, we have
another caller here.

394
00:28:40,355 --> 00:28:41,720
Hey, Charlie,
I just want to say

395
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:43,684
it could be some kind
of government thing,

396
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,191
contamination of our drinking water
they're trying to cover up.

397
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:32,330
It sounded to me
that what the boy described

398
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:34,037
was a classic
abduction scenario.

399
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,872
You see, the Greys, they're the aliens
from Alpha Centauri,

400
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:39,958
and they abduct people
for their genetic experiments.

401
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:43,169
And the thing that tipped me off--
he said he was paralyzed.

402
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,236
Psychiatrist on the line here.

403
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,777
Dr. Perkowski, what do you
have to say about all this?

404
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,786
I'd just like to say,
from my experience,

405
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,789
that there are a number
of different types of mental illness

406
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,792
which could go undiagnosed
for Iong periods of time.

407
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,827
The caller on the air
may have had an episode

408
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,997
of extreme
schizophrenic paranoia.

409
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,586
In these instances,
the victim can often see things

410
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,375
that aren't there,
react to them.

411
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:32,420
The world of the imagination
and the real world blends

412
00:31:32,597 --> 00:31:34,838
so that they cannot
distinguish the difference.

413
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:37,258
In such a case, it's natural
that he could have believed

414
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:40,974
that a man or a shadowy figure
of some kind was stalking him.

415
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:44,105
It's important for your audience
to be aware that these delusions

416
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:46,357
are fairly common,
but we must remember

417
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:48,267
that they are only
in our imagination.

418
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:49,982
And no matter how frightening
they seem,

419
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:52,863
they can't really harm you.

420
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:29,856
All right, that is a wrap
for "The Night Shift."

421
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:32,859
Good night, sleep tight,

422
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:34,940
and don't let
the bedbugs bite.

423
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:37,150
Ace Auto
is your headquarters for used...

424
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:40,407
That is the most callers
we have ever had.

425
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,617
- Any word on the numbers?
- I don't know.

426
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:45,074
I'm gonna have to check them
tomorrow, man,

427
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:48,240
but I have a really good feeling
that they're gonna be good.

428
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:53,081
- Like to get syndicated good?
- Like we could get syndicated good.

429
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:58,207
- What's your name?
- Brittany Daniels.

430
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:01,469
- And what year are you?
- Sophomore.

431
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:04,714
I came home and normally

432
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,927
I'm kind of Ioud,
so I make a lot of noise.

433
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:09,184
Maggie, you missed the craziest
fucking night ever.

434
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,811
Okay, so, I'm, like,
still drunk right now.

435
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:14,267
We're taking all these tequila shots
and they dare me to streak,

436
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:17,525
so, of course, I did,
and I'm like halfway back

437
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,777
from the fucking oak tree,
and I totally puked.

438
00:33:20,948 --> 00:33:23,690
Oh, my God, it's like the third time
I've puked there this year.

439
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:26,654
Hello?

440
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:29,662
Oh, God, don't tell me
you're pissed at me.

441
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,036
Hello?

442
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:40,879
I mean, I just felt awful
for her parents

443
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,713
and just her friends having to go on
and her roommate.

444
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:48,378
I knew about her roommate a little bit,
but that's pretty much it.

445
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:50,093
I mean, they were all--

446
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:52,132
it's pretty-- it's pretty sad,
it's pretty intense.

447
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,299
Not gonna lie.

448
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:29,666
Holy shit.

449
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:34,005
I have noticed-- not that
I'm a nosy neighbor--

450
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:37,721
but I have noticed, um,
he sits in that window a lot

451
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:41,887
and is doing research,
he tells me.

452
00:34:42,064 --> 00:34:45,101
Tom: The circumstances
of the kid's death

453
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:47,062
has really affected him.

454
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:51,233
We had a caller
on a previous show

455
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:53,022
who believed
he was seeing things.

456
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:54,531
For all I know,
they're unrelated.

457
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:55,986
I mean, I just-- I don't know.

458
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,618
I think some of it's rumor
and speculation,

459
00:34:58,788 --> 00:35:01,325
conspiracy theories--
that kind of stuff.

460
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,037
He said he believed
if he closed his eyes,

461
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:05,576
he might never wake up.

462
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:09,245
And, in this case,
he was right.

463
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:10,833
Nobody else got sick.

464
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,296
I mean, these few people have died
and under strange circumstances.

465
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,960
It's all he talks about.

466
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:20,051
I mean, now, since that kid called up
and talked to him on the radio.

467
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:22,637
People go in for that,
especially in the middle of the night.

468
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,675
I mean, that's--
that's our market.

469
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:28,267
Who hasn't felt like someone
was watching them in their sleep

470
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:30,932
or, like, a shadow moved
in the corner?

471
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,022
We usually dismiss this
as paranoia,

472
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:37,063
that you're seeing things
that aren't there,

473
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:40,233
that it's a trick of the eyes,
but let's assume,

474
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,743
for the moment,
that it's not.

475
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:46,246
We'll open up the lines.
Caller?

476
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,077
I was sinking
so much into my bed.

477
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,742
- Eventually I woke up.
- I felt like I was suffocating.

478
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,909
I felt something hit my legs

479
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:53,669
or jump on the bed,
that weight change.

480
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,329
And I just-- I felt this presence.

481
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:57,794
You're yelling at yourself, Iike,
"Do something, do something,"

482
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,254
and you can't.

483
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:01,089
Just people moving in old houses

484
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:04,175
and they say they hear doors creak
'cause somebody died in the house.

485
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:06,590
Thinking they're seeing things,
but not really seeing anything.

486
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:08,929
Some people have reported
it sounding very raspy.

487
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:11,095
It was like this buzz sound.

488
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:13,355
It's increased listenership.
People want to talk about it.

489
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,731
- People want to hear about it.
- I listen to Charlie Crowe quite a bit.

490
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,766
Yeah.
Yeah, I've heard him.

491
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:19,481
Don't know about him,
but, yeah, I've heard him.

492
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,362
He was involved in a lot worse,
though, Mr. Crowe was.

493
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:25,149
Ah, hell,
that's just Charlie.

494
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:27,488
People say these things
come to us

495
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:29,152
when we sleep.

496
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,946
Is there something we do
while sleeping that calls them to us?

497
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,831
It's almost like insanity.

498
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:35,287
I just have to have
an answer for this.

499
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,042
- It's so freaky.
- A long time

500
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:38,999
after that, I was terrified
to go to bed.

501
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:42,586
They can't move, they can't speak,
and they can barely breathe.

502
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:44,590
It feels Iike there's
a pressure on their chest.

503
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:48,299
They feel like they're suffocating,
and it's terrifying.

504
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,134
Sleep paralysis is the experience

505
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:53,551
of awakening unable to move,

506
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:55,811
and it's produced by
a physiological mechanism

507
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,016
in the brain that's well understood.

508
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,896
This is a normal
human experience.

509
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,934
One in five of us will have it
at some point in our Iife.

510
00:37:03,112 --> 00:37:04,272
It wasn't like
I was paralyzed,

511
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,984
because I think when you're paralyzed,
you don't really feel your body.

512
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,114
80% of people
who have sleep paralysis

513
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,696
experience some kind
of hallucination.

514
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,110
It's not actually
like a hooded person

515
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:14,994
or like a floating black cloud.

516
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:17,656
Out the corner of my eye,
I could see these dark shapes.

517
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,291
I have a maybe,
Iike, nine-foot ceiling

518
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:21,952
and it nearly reached that.

519
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,461
I know nobody's in the house.

520
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:25,792
You can imagine
how freaky that is.

521
00:37:25,966 --> 00:37:27,297
I don't think it was
anything I wanted

522
00:37:27,468 --> 00:37:29,174
to really look at for very long.

523
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:30,710
It's interesting how many
people are coming together

524
00:37:30,888 --> 00:37:32,173
and discussing these things now.

525
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:34,134
I'm really fascinated
by all the stories coming in.

526
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:37,720
There's so many people calling in
with their experiences.

527
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:39,555
The numbers keep growing.

528
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:42,015
Are they all making it up?
I don't think so.

529
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:46,687
The shadow people--
can it all be real?

530
00:38:15,888 --> 00:38:17,628
Oh, shit.

531
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:37,400
As the first EIS officer
on the scene,

532
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:38,905
I went to the coroner's office

533
00:38:39,076 --> 00:38:42,318
and was able to examine
the second victim--

534
00:38:42,496 --> 00:38:44,612
a 21 -year-old female.

535
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,743
So the tissue sample
showed no pathogens?

536
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:55,288
No. White blood cell
counts: normal.

537
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,128
Died in her sleep
just like the first victim.

538
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,088
Two cases like this,
two days apart.

539
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,551
- Did the two have contact?
- Don't know.

540
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:09,976
Why, the CDC think this condition
may be contagious?

541
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,354
Well, that's what I'm here
to determine.

542
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:17,270
No heart defect.
Toxicology's negative.

543
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:20,812
Which is odd because the male victim
was reported to be hallucinating.

544
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,778
- Hallucinating?
- That's what the police report said.

545
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:28,114
He was checked
into the hospital

546
00:39:28,288 --> 00:39:31,280
where he saw, like, delusions
of shadows moving all around him.

547
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,119
Hmm.
Strange.

548
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:35,955
Maybe hallucinations
are a possible symptom.

549
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:38,495
- What about brain biopsy?
- Normal.

550
00:39:38,673 --> 00:39:42,256
And we're looking for someone
who's possibly overweight

551
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,633
or someone who has
high blood pressure

552
00:39:44,803 --> 00:39:46,964
or someone who has,
like, diabetes

553
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:50,723
or just a history in their family
of stroke or heart attacks.

554
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:52,758
So these victims were,
you know, young,

555
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:54,766
they were completely healthy.

556
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,973
You know,
we checked their blood,

557
00:39:57,148 --> 00:39:58,684
and there's nothing
in their blood that shows

558
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:01,315
that they have any
fatty deposits in their heart.

559
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,068
No history of diabetes
in the family, you know,

560
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:07,354
no history of stroke,
no history of cancer.

561
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,695
If this was in Cambodia,
the diagnosis would be easy.

562
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,416
Very scared?

563
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:34,300
It was first noticed
in the Hmong immigrants

564
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,966
who came from Vietnam
to the United States

565
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,055
right after the Vietnam War.

566
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,267
We did get a team
of microbiologists,

567
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,308
pathologists,
epidemiologists.

568
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,648
We did blood cultures,
urine samples.

569
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,985
We did sputum cultures,
we tested for heavy metals.

570
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:54,898
The most disturbing
part of this

571
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,661
is we did not find
a biological agent.

572
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,412
In the archives,

573
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:03,197
I found a condition

574
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:06,960
called sudden unexplained
nocturnal death syndrome,

575
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:11,088
and I believe that this
is very likely a resurgence.

576
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,341
This condition

577
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:16,843
had very similar circumstances

578
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:20,050
to these young people who have
died here in Eastern Kentucky.

579
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:22,216
Did anyone do a trip report?

580
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:23,884
If I remember correctly,

581
00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:27,270
the first EIS officer
went on-site in 1981.

582
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,773
Initially, we thought the disease
triggered cardiac arrest during sleep,

583
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:34,185
yet more recent studies indicate

584
00:41:34,363 --> 00:41:37,150
that lack of oxygen to the brain
may be the cause.

585
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:39,656
The victims showed
no genetic history

586
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:42,738
of myocardial infarction
or sleep apnea.

587
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,073
And we're still unclear on a cause?

588
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:47,455
The data was inconclusive.

589
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,241
It seems hundreds
of healthy immigrants

590
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,331
just died in their sleep
without cause.

591
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:54,416
One more question,
Dr. Lacombe.

592
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,876
Does the syndrome
appear to be communicable?

593
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,416
The truth is we really don't
have enough evidence

594
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:01,631
to make a conclusion
either way.

595
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:05,218
Well, I don't think that explanation
is gonna fly with the public.

596
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:20,607
- Mr. Crowe?
- Yeah.

597
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:22,146
Hi, I'm Sophie Lacombe.

598
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:24,030
I'm with the Center
for Disease Control.

599
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,361
I got your address
from Tom at the station.

600
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:28,652
Disease control?
What kind of diseases?

601
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,243
Well, I'm here investigating
the local deaths and their causes.

602
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,124
It seems there may be
some new cases of a disease

603
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,626
that we call sudden unexplained
nocturnal death syndrome.

604
00:42:37,796 --> 00:42:39,411
Okay, I'll save you some time.

605
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,251
Those deaths weren't caused
by a disease.

606
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,631
In fact,
they were caused by--

607
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:44,792
Shadow people?

608
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:51,719
I was just brewing
some coffee.

609
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:53,303
- Thank you.
- You want a cup?

610
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:54,968
No, thanks.

611
00:42:56,564 --> 00:42:58,600
Come, sit.

612
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,443
So I'm looking for a link
between these deaths.

613
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:07,104
After interviewing some people
about the victims,

614
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:10,024
I was told that some of them
were listening to your radio show

615
00:43:10,202 --> 00:43:11,817
before they died.

616
00:43:11,995 --> 00:43:15,863
- Can you explain that?
- No, I can't.

617
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,996
I'm just reporting
what people are telling me.

618
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:21,250
I'm trying to give them a voice.
If anything, I'm trying to help.

619
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,332
Well, so am I, Mr. Crowe.
That's why I'm here.

620
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:28,796
You see, the victims reported
hallucinations, sleep paralysis--

621
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,756
symptoms that you
talked about on your show.

622
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,091
Perhaps if I could get
your call logs,

623
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,677
I could track
the infected victims.

624
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:39,684
Yeah, I'll give you anything you want,
but it's not gonna do you any good

625
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:43,346
unless you realize that
what these people are seeing is real.

626
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:46,436
A lot of people think just 'cause
they can't explain it scientifically

627
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,353
that it doesn't exist, but I can
tell you that our ancestors

628
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:53,113
knew about nightmares
and how harmful they are.

629
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:55,365
Well, I'm certain that bad dreams
can't harm you.

630
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:58,027
I'm not talking about bad dreams.
I mean nightmares.

631
00:43:58,205 --> 00:43:59,990
The actual word nightmare

632
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:02,871
is an Old English word
that means evil spirit.

633
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:04,748
A maere-- M-A-E-R-E--

634
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:07,786
that comes in the night
to attack its victim.

635
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:10,171
Now, in modern times,
we've changed that meaning.

636
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:13,047
I think we've changed it
to cover up the truth.

637
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,209
Look, here's one.

638
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:20,138
A real one.
A real nightmare.

639
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:25,557
Now, every culture
documents this.

640
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:28,267
The Native Americans
called it the Raven Mocker.

641
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:30,557
It was a shadow that comes
to steal your soul.

642
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:33,397
In the Middle East, they call it jinn,
and they believe they were created

643
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:36,313
at the same time as us by God,
but to live in a different dimension.

644
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,072
Now these are cultures
that are far older than ours,

645
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,324
but they've all reported
the same thing

646
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:43,735
from different parts
of the world for centuries.

647
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:47,405
And now, for the past 100 years,
we've started to deny their existence.

648
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,495
I think it's us
who's being naive.

649
00:44:49,669 --> 00:44:52,706
I think it's one of those things
you're not ever gonna truly believe--

650
00:44:52,881 --> 00:44:55,292
Until you see it for yourself.

651
00:44:55,466 --> 00:44:58,424
You got a knack for finishing
people's sentences, Iady.

652
00:45:00,137 --> 00:45:01,593
Well, that's the point, isn't it?

653
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:04,506
Seeing is believing?
Yet there's no proof of these claims.

654
00:45:04,683 --> 00:45:07,344
- I have proof.
- You do?

655
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,270
These don't really
prove anything.

656
00:45:16,444 --> 00:45:18,560
I mean, for all I know,
it could be a hoax.

657
00:45:18,738 --> 00:45:22,229
That's what I thought,
but this Dr. Ravenscroft

658
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:23,772
published a scientific journal.

659
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,565
Huh. I'm gonna have to
get over to the college

660
00:45:25,744 --> 00:45:28,030
and talk to someone about
Ravenscroft and his research.

661
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:31,572
Maybe he found something about
this disease that I don't know about.

662
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,786
Yeah, but I keep telling you,
it's not a disease.

663
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,745
It's more-- it's like a...

664
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,286
- Curse?
- Yeah.

665
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:41,831
Like I said, lady,
you have a knack.

666
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,125
- Bye.
- See you tonight.

667
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:55,894
Professor Fisher?
Hi, Sophie Lacombe.

668
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:58,555
Oh, yes, from the CDC.

669
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:01,439
They told me I'd have
a visitor today.

670
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,226
- Please.
- Thank you.

671
00:46:04,404 --> 00:46:06,486
What can I do for you?

672
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:09,364
Well, I'm looking for some
information on Dr. Ravenscroft.

673
00:46:09,535 --> 00:46:12,618
Do you know where
I might find him?

674
00:46:12,788 --> 00:46:15,699
Resurrection Cemetery
Iast time I checked.

675
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,488
Sorry.

676
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,123
Well, I'm looking for
some information

677
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:21,579
on a research study
he did in 1971.

678
00:46:21,754 --> 00:46:25,042
A sleep study, if I'm not mistaken,
and hallucinations.

679
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:28,707
Ravenscroft was a bit
of a loose cannon back in those years.

680
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:30,546
What was he researching?

681
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,463
The story that I heard
was that he was adamant

682
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:39,305
that he could prove that the mind
could influence matter.

683
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:42,720
He wired

684
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:47,062
several of his subjects
to a door.

685
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:52,108
The goal was to use their minds
to open the door

686
00:46:52,283 --> 00:46:53,898
by getting them all
to concentrate

687
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:57,317
on the same intention
at the same time.

688
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:59,031
To do that,
he had to get them

689
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:02,572
to a very intense
brain wave state,

690
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,743
a state between
wakefulness and sleep.

691
00:47:06,921 --> 00:47:09,457
A most intense signal.

692
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:13,920
He would amplify the brain waves
among several subjects

693
00:47:14,094 --> 00:47:17,586
and, channeling it to the door,
he hoped to produce a result.

694
00:47:17,764 --> 00:47:19,595
So what happened?

695
00:47:19,766 --> 00:47:21,677
Well, he produced a result,

696
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:24,263
but it was not the one
he intended.

697
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:27,682
All of the subjects died.

698
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:29,222
Really?

699
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,891
I'd guess it was either
the equipment

700
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:34,811
or the intensity
of the testing procedure

701
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:37,695
that disrupted
the normal brain function.

702
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:40,733
But the truth will only be
in his write-ups

703
00:47:40,911 --> 00:47:43,618
or any films that he may
have made of the experiment.

704
00:47:43,788 --> 00:47:46,370
And do you have no idea
where this material might be?

705
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:49,248
He said it was too dangerous
for mankind.

706
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:51,500
I'd guess he'd
have destroyed it,

707
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,207
- except that...
- Except what?

708
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:56,497
Well, you're a scientist.

709
00:47:56,675 --> 00:47:58,165
You know how difficult
it would be

710
00:47:58,344 --> 00:48:00,551
to suppress
your own findings.

711
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:02,302
I mean, it's what
we live for, right?

712
00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:04,087
He wasn't that good a scientist

713
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:05,926
in terms of his methodology.

714
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,967
In terms of his thinking,
he was incredibly creative.

715
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:11,852
With what we know now, we could
Iook back at what he discovered

716
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:15,106
and what he was working on
and maybe make better sense of it

717
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:17,232
than he was able to at the time.

718
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:20,610
I suspect it is lost.

719
00:48:21,657 --> 00:48:23,488
I think so.

720
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:26,651
If he didn't destroy it,
then I think the college might have.

721
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:30,662
He lived in this big old house...

722
00:48:30,832 --> 00:48:32,822
on the corner of Elm and Maple.

723
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,867
I went down to the house
to see him

724
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:38,912
and there was no furniture
in the house.

725
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,126
The house was
completely empty,

726
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,165
as though the movers
had been in

727
00:48:43,344 --> 00:48:46,756
and cleaned it out,
yet he was still living there.

728
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,221
That's it.

729
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:02,020
Charlie,
hate to kick you out, man.

730
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:04,025
I gotta go.

731
00:49:14,956 --> 00:49:16,071
Outside under the window.

732
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:17,489
You know where.

733
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:20,829
You're not afraid,
are you, Raymond?

734
00:49:21,004 --> 00:49:22,414
Who, me? Scared?

735
00:49:24,257 --> 00:49:26,338
It's just that I don't think
that there's gonna be

736
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:28,419
any murder here
done after all.

737
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:30,925
If that's true, then why
did you declare her dead?

738
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,927
I had my own good reasons.

739
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:34,804
Would you give me one reason
why you like to go around

740
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,010
getting hit on the head?

741
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:37,549
That must become
a little monotonous.

742
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:39,592
Mr. Lee, are you sure

743
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,728
that you saw
what you thought you saw?

744
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:45,352
- What's it say?
- Aw, come on, Doctor.

745
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:47,608
Don't hold out on us.

746
00:49:47,778 --> 00:49:49,734
I didn't understand it
at first, but I do now.

747
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:51,736
There were no marks of violence
on the body and we found

748
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:53,567
no internal disturbances.

749
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,027
What does this all
add up to, Doctor?

750
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,236
Yes, let's have it.

751
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:59,278
She was literally
scared to death.

752
00:50:26,147 --> 00:50:27,557
There's radio waves
going through this room

753
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:28,767
and I can't hear them now,

754
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:32,229
but if I pick up a little device
like this called a radio

755
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:35,439
and I turn the knob to 28.6 FM,

756
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:37,605
there's music
playing on my radio.

757
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:40,946
There's so much more energy
in the atmosphere,

758
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,531
in this-- what we perceive
to be empty space.

759
00:50:43,705 --> 00:50:45,912
You've got what's called
the visible light spectrum,

760
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:49,324
and it's, like, 5% of all
of the other waveforms

761
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:51,788
that exist in
the electromagnetic spectrum.

762
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:54,294
You've got Wi-Fi,
cell phones,

763
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:56,877
radio, television, satellite--
it's all there.

764
00:50:57,051 --> 00:50:59,633
Well, if there were something
in your environment

765
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:02,340
that had a color
that was outside

766
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:05,551
of our visual range
and it stood in front of you,

767
00:51:05,725 --> 00:51:08,387
it wouldn't be invisible,
it would just look black.

768
00:51:08,561 --> 00:51:11,769
So it's possible
that these things can grab

769
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,726
your favorite
radio station's frequency

770
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,311
and say, okay, here's something
I can latch onto

771
00:51:16,485 --> 00:51:17,975
and I can manifest myself with.

772
00:51:38,214 --> 00:51:39,670
Where the hell have you been?

773
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:41,796
You were supposed to take
Preston this morning.

774
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:45,585
Oh, shit, Ellen.
I'm sorry. I overslept.

775
00:51:45,762 --> 00:51:48,219
- Yeah, big surprise.
- What are you doing?

776
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,597
Getting a video game
Preston Ieft here.

777
00:51:56,689 --> 00:51:59,601
What is up, Ellen?
I overslept one time, okay?

778
00:51:59,775 --> 00:52:02,391
- I'm sorry.
- It's the least of what you've done.

779
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,936
What's that?

780
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:08,106
Exploiting that poor kid's death
for your radio show.

781
00:52:08,284 --> 00:52:10,899
That's low...
even for you, Charlie.

782
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:13,033
Whoa, hey.

783
00:52:13,204 --> 00:52:15,320
Hold on, okay.

784
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:20,910
- I'm doing that out of concern.
- The hell you are.

785
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:23,293
You can't tell me you actually
believe that crap.

786
00:52:23,464 --> 00:52:26,251
The shadow people?
What is that?

787
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:29,383
You know, what does it matter
to you anyway?

788
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,131
Whoa.

789
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:37,264
You still listen to my show.

790
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:42,349
No, Preston does.

791
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,395
Hey.

792
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:55,069
Radio.

793
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:59,744
It's cruel, you know that.
You were with me.

794
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:01,826
Working all those crap markets
all over the country,

795
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,832
trying to make it big,
and now...

796
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:07,869
I have a chance
to really reach people.

797
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:09,833
Reach them
and give them what?

798
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:12,919
This is my shot, Ellen.

799
00:53:14,512 --> 00:53:17,093
One day Preston
will know that.

800
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:32,604
Can we talk to you about
your ex-husband Charlie Crowe?

801
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:34,484
- No. No.
- Can we talk to you about--

802
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:36,191
- Nothing to say.
- We just want to ask you

803
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:37,946
just a couple questions
about him.

804
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:42,234
We just want to ask you
a couple questions about Charlie.

805
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,368
Miss?

806
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,327
There's that expression,
"Speak of the devil,"

807
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:51,117
that you say when someone
you've been talking about shows up,

808
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:55,459
but that phrase
is really a warning.

809
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:01,297
Speak of the devil
and he doth appear.

810
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,631
Did you play or were
you on the bench?

811
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,266
I was on the bench.

812
00:54:08,436 --> 00:54:11,178
- Was your mom there?
- Yeah.

813
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:16,850
She was there with Robert,
but I wish she was there with you.

814
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:21,236
You used to go to all my games
before you and her split.

815
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:23,648
Yeah, I know, dude.
I'm sorry about that.

816
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:28,193
Wish we were back together.

817
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,619
Yeah.

818
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:38,495
Maybe our brains are like
my broadcast tower,

819
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,498
sending our thoughts out
through the universe,

820
00:54:42,676 --> 00:54:46,339
but, until now, we didn't realize
that somewhere,

821
00:54:46,513 --> 00:54:49,129
someone is listening.

822
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:55,014
Jeff Pyatt died right after
he called in on this show.

823
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:57,052
He certainly
wasn't making it up.

824
00:54:57,231 --> 00:55:01,019
No one seems to have a rational
explanation for these deaths,

825
00:55:01,193 --> 00:55:04,560
but in every case, people report
seeing the shadow people.

826
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:07,946
Now, what if these things
really can kill us?

827
00:55:08,116 --> 00:55:09,902
Jeff sent me evidence.

828
00:55:15,498 --> 00:55:16,988
These experiments concluded,

829
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,578
but there is a possibility
that there was some attempt

830
00:55:19,752 --> 00:55:22,835
to measure or contain
one of these beings...

831
00:56:42,995 --> 00:56:45,361
It's the third mysterious death
in three weeks.

832
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,246
29-year-old Marian Sobel

833
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,624
is the latest victim
to die in her sleep.

834
00:56:49,794 --> 00:56:52,126
All three of the deceased
were apparently healthy

835
00:56:52,296 --> 00:56:55,537
with no previous illness,
and an investigation is underway

836
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:57,126
by the Center for Disease Control.

837
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,133
Probably part of being scared
is all these people

838
00:57:00,303 --> 00:57:01,383
running around
with these badges.

839
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:04,342
We know that we get people
calling us and telling us

840
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,848
what they think they're hearing
or seeing or whatever,

841
00:57:07,018 --> 00:57:08,723
and it sounds
strangely consistent.

842
00:57:08,894 --> 00:57:10,976
But for all I know,
it's mass hysteria.

843
00:57:11,147 --> 00:57:13,809
I don't know if we'd call it
hysteria or not.

844
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:17,521
It's, I don't know, just...
a chain of events, maybe.

845
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:19,356
We've got the outbreak in the '70s

846
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,646
and we've got the current
outbreak in Kentucky.

847
00:57:21,824 --> 00:57:24,064
This outbreak has a lot of people
pretty frightened,

848
00:57:24,242 --> 00:57:27,405
as the transmission properties
of the disease are still unknown.

849
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:29,160
Some new disease

850
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,786
that they're coming
to investigate or something.

851
00:57:30,957 --> 00:57:32,697
I think there's something
fishy going on.

852
00:57:32,876 --> 00:57:35,242
I'm not positive.

853
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,875
It's hysteria.

854
00:57:37,045 --> 00:57:40,629
I don't give any credibility.
There's no scientific basis in fact.

855
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,676
Oh, shit.
See there.

856
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:48,337
That, right there.
W-What is that?

857
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:50,220
Yeah, this is a big
publicity stunt.

858
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:51,881
The problem
with people like you is,

859
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:53,674
is that you get
in people's heads.

860
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:55,263
You're poisoning kids' minds.

861
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:58,851
To tell the truth,
my friends think you're crazy.

862
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:00,731
Oh, I doubt that very much.

863
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:03,563
- I'm sure they're all big fans.
- Oh.

864
00:58:03,737 --> 00:58:06,479
- They're really big fans, Dad.
- Now, what else did they--

865
00:58:06,656 --> 00:58:09,523
They don't think you're crazy.
They don't.

866
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:12,283
I'm being sarcastic,
of course.

867
00:58:20,878 --> 00:58:23,244
The shadow people know
when we think of them,

868
00:58:23,422 --> 00:58:27,210
and then they come for us.

869
00:58:29,345 --> 00:58:33,383
And that question
Jeff asked me still haunts me.

870
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:38,433
How do you stop yourself
from thinking about something?

871
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:04,244
Hey.

872
00:59:04,418 --> 00:59:05,954
- You okay?
- I've been better.

873
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:10,672
I met with a professor
about Ravenscroft's experiments.

874
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:13,378
They were real.
You were right about that.

875
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:16,794
He also told me
that all the test subjects died.

876
00:59:16,972 --> 00:59:21,011
I was wondering if Ravenscroft died
from the same experiment.

877
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:23,095
I wanted to exhume
and examine his body,

878
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,136
but the strange thing is his death
certificate says that he was cremated.

879
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,395
- What's strange about that?
- The professor told me

880
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:31,603
that Ravenscroft is buried
in a cemetery near the college.

881
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,940
If he's cremated,
then what's buried in that grave?

882
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,400
- That's what I intend to find out.
- Give me five minutes.

883
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,781
- What for?
- I'm coming with you.

884
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,942
We're gonna need more coffee.

885
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,788
- Are you okay?
- Oh.

886
00:59:55,966 --> 00:59:59,299
I just keep nodding off.
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

887
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,676
- You're welcome to lay in the car.
- No.

888
01:00:12,064 --> 01:00:14,430
Go ahead and try
and open that if you can.

889
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:17,482
Oh, my God.

890
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:19,517
What the hell is that?

891
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:27,567
Here, hold that.

892
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:38,123
A film.

893
01:00:38,297 --> 01:00:39,878
Great.

894
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:42,005
Got anything we can
watch this on?

895
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:05,523
In the 16th test group,

896
01:01:05,697 --> 01:01:09,315
we have given all subjects
the same intention.

897
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:12,360
A device was affixed
on the head

898
01:01:12,537 --> 01:01:16,745
and the lead wire terminated
at the actual intention point.

899
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:20,829
In this case,
a simple metal door.

900
01:01:23,422 --> 01:01:27,334
As they repeated the intention
to open the door,

901
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:31,093
we monitored
their brain activity.

902
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:35,221
The subjects then repeated
the intention in their mind

903
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:38,759
until they reached a sleep state.

904
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:44,139
At 12.3 hours,
subject number seven

905
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:48,184
experienced higher than
average heart rate

906
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:50,398
and sporadic jerking

907
01:01:50,572 --> 01:01:56,066
indicative of NREM
of stage one N-1-6.

908
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:42,612
Jesus. It's real.

909
01:02:44,122 --> 01:02:46,454
He filmed one.

910
01:02:46,624 --> 01:02:49,615
- This is a hoax.
- How can you still say that?

911
01:02:50,919 --> 01:02:52,284
I'm taking this to the press
in the morning.

912
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:54,454
People have to see this.
People have to be warned.

913
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:57,623
This is evidence.
I-- I'm not crazy.

914
01:02:57,801 --> 01:03:00,884
Listen, I have to get up early
and start writing my report.

915
01:03:01,055 --> 01:03:04,012
I'm probably going to have
to turn that over to the CDC.

916
01:03:04,182 --> 01:03:05,922
No.

917
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,215
I'm keeping this.

918
01:03:07,393 --> 01:03:10,760
You can-- you can tell them
the grave was empty.

919
01:03:10,938 --> 01:03:14,305
I won't tell anyone
where I got it.

920
01:03:14,484 --> 01:03:17,145
You're not-- you're not
taking this from me.

921
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:23,189
There's nothing
on that film, so...

922
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,652
as far as I'm concerned,
it doesn't exist.

923
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,506
Oh, God.

924
01:05:19,557 --> 01:05:22,014
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

925
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:25,134
Oh, my God.

926
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:28,874
Would you raise your
right hand, please, Mr. Camfield?

927
01:07:29,052 --> 01:07:31,384
Do you solemnly swear
the testimony you are to give

928
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:35,263
to be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

929
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:38,891
- so help you God?
- Yes, I do.

930
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:42,019
I represent the family
of Jeff Pyatt,

931
01:07:42,189 --> 01:07:46,057
and we have filed a lawsuit
against the...

932
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:50,227
radio station, relating to
the death of Jeff Pyatt.

933
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:53,317
In early November of 2008,

934
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:57,985
were you scheduled to appear
on the Channel 5 television station?

935
01:07:58,163 --> 01:07:59,619
Yes, I was.

936
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:02,495
...from Russell Springs
in fierce competition today.

937
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:05,783
So let's go, fighting Koalas!
It's on to the championship for you.

938
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:08,122
And for those of you who are fans
of "The Night Shift,"

939
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:09,958
our own radio host
Charlie Crowe

940
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:11,588
will be on the Channel 5 News
tonight at 6:00,

941
01:08:11,759 --> 01:08:14,842
where he claims he has evidence
of the supernatural to show.

942
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:16,842
So be sure to watch that.
I know I'll be.

943
01:08:17,013 --> 01:08:18,423
And a lot of people thought
he was pulling a hoax,

944
01:08:18,598 --> 01:08:20,384
but I'll tell you,
Dan, it's--

945
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:27,471
We have a special treat coming up
for you at the end of the hour.

946
01:08:27,648 --> 01:08:30,263
A local radio host
claims to have evidence

947
01:08:30,442 --> 01:08:32,273
of the supernatural.

948
01:08:32,444 --> 01:08:35,732
And it seems he already has offers
for a book deal and movie of the week.

949
01:08:36,823 --> 01:08:39,986
Hey, I got a transfer
of that film made.

950
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,617
Syndication, here we come.

951
01:08:43,913 --> 01:08:47,280
Oh, I really hope Preston
and Ellen are watching.

952
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,665
It'd be good for him to see me
do something extraordinary.

953
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:53,123
I'm sure they are.
Knock 'em dead, buddy.

954
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:55,379
Hey, this is it.

955
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:22,438
Hi. Do you have any ibuprofen
or anything back there?

956
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,526
Rough night last night, huh?

957
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,736
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

958
01:09:28,913 --> 01:09:30,494
Let me tell you
my hangover cure.

959
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:32,496
I drink a can of tomato juice,

960
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:35,704
suck on a lemon,
and smoke three cigarettes.

961
01:09:35,878 --> 01:09:38,835
Works every time, guaranteed.
Better than aspirin.

962
01:09:39,005 --> 01:09:40,836
That doesn't work.
It's an old wives' tale.

963
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:42,543
Aw, hell, works for me.

964
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:45,003
- It's a placebo.
- A what?

965
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:46,213
A placebo.

966
01:09:46,388 --> 01:09:49,676
The mind tells--
oh, my God.

967
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:53,845
Ma'am?
You want your change?

968
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:16,162
Many primitive cultures under--

969
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:18,868
Just relax, buddy.
You can do this. Ahem.

970
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:50,435
Up until several hundred years ago,
many different cultures--

971
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:52,775
Charlie, you can't
go through with this.

972
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,780
- You can't show that film.
- What are you talking about?

973
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,740
Okay, thanks for the story,
Barbara.

974
01:11:00,915 --> 01:11:02,405
So now in just a little while...

975
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:03,743
Listen to me.

976
01:11:03,918 --> 01:11:05,954
The body responds
to what the mind tells it.

977
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,618
It's called the "placebo effect."

978
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,627
If you give a patient
a sugar pill

979
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,163
and you tell them
that it's medicine,

980
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:13,957
in many cases
the body will heal itself.

981
01:11:14,135 --> 01:11:17,423
So if the mind tells the body
that there are shadow people

982
01:11:17,597 --> 01:11:19,713
and that they can kill us,
then, by God, they can.

983
01:11:21,226 --> 01:11:22,887
I don't know
what your agenda is.

984
01:11:23,061 --> 01:11:25,097
I don't know if you're trying to squash
this because you don't want it out

985
01:11:25,271 --> 01:11:27,226
or now someone from the government
wants to keep a lid on it.

986
01:11:27,397 --> 01:11:30,230
No, I want to keep a lid on it.

987
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,766
We're actually creating
these things in our mind.

988
01:11:32,945 --> 01:11:35,732
When you sleep, you can't
control what you think.

989
01:11:35,906 --> 01:11:37,988
Two minutes.

990
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:40,113
Charlie, listen.

991
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,904
Charlie, all the people who died,
they were believers.

992
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:49,119
If you put this on national television
and you say it's real,

993
01:11:49,293 --> 01:11:51,909
a lot of people will believe.

994
01:11:55,257 --> 01:11:58,169
As recently as 2002,
the CDC is investigating

995
01:11:58,343 --> 01:12:00,459
a condition called
Morgellons disease.

996
01:12:00,637 --> 01:12:02,548
And this was a condition
in California

997
01:12:02,722 --> 01:12:06,635
where people became ill
after watching television.

998
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:10,893
They would hear about a rash,
develop the rash,

999
01:12:11,063 --> 01:12:14,305
the skin biopsy showed
dermatologic irritation,

1000
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:16,474
but absolutely no source.

1001
01:12:16,652 --> 01:12:21,486
Due to the fact that when people
believe they are sick,

1002
01:12:21,656 --> 01:12:24,648
they will actually
make themselves sick.

1003
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:27,574
And if that happens,

1004
01:12:27,745 --> 01:12:31,988
the end result in this condition
is mortality.

1005
01:12:35,711 --> 01:12:37,576
Let's get him
spinning it around.

1006
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:40,996
- All right, hold it.
- Camera one, crop the top.

1007
01:12:41,174 --> 01:12:44,166
One more.
Let's test camera two.

1008
01:12:45,387 --> 01:12:47,298
Okay.

1009
01:12:50,016 --> 01:12:51,927
In 10, nine...

1010
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,012
Camera three,
let me see your shot.

1011
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:56,177
All right, we got that.
Roll in five.

1012
01:12:56,355 --> 01:13:00,974
...five, four, three, two...

1013
01:13:05,822 --> 01:13:08,689
We're here with radio talk show
host Charlie Crowe.

1014
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:10,232
Okay, I'll just say it.

1015
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,446
Well, all this shadow people stuff

1016
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:14,862
is a pretty hard pill to swallow,
you have to admit.

1017
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,074
Uh, yeah, I know.

1018
01:13:16,248 --> 01:13:18,204
But we're told you say
you have proof of them.

1019
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:19,706
Is that right?

1020
01:13:19,877 --> 01:13:22,744
Are you ready to show us
that proof now?

1021
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:26,213
Here is your forum.

1022
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,541
Mr. Crowe?

1023
01:13:31,095 --> 01:13:35,008
- We are live.
- Uh, yes. Ahem.

1024
01:13:36,017 --> 01:13:40,761
The proof I have
of the shadow people...

1025
01:13:41,898 --> 01:13:42,932
is...

1026
01:13:52,824 --> 01:13:54,610
that...

1027
01:13:56,285 --> 01:13:57,274
there is no proof.

1028
01:13:57,453 --> 01:13:59,569
Um...

1029
01:13:59,747 --> 01:14:01,453
this is all an elaborate hoax.

1030
01:14:01,624 --> 01:14:05,242
It's a-- a stunt I pulled
at the station.

1031
01:14:05,419 --> 01:14:06,408
It's a ratings stunt.

1032
01:14:06,587 --> 01:14:09,919
I-- I should apologize
to everyone.

1033
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,376
I'm very sorry.
This is a huge mistake.

1034
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:15,587
So you're admitting on live TV
that this is all a hoax

1035
01:14:15,762 --> 01:14:17,627
and there are
no shadow people?

1036
01:14:18,848 --> 01:14:22,090
Are you worried how this might
adversely affect your career, Mr. Crowe?

1037
01:14:22,268 --> 01:14:23,598
I'm not sure,
to be honest with you,

1038
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:25,430
if it was a great idea
to even be here today.

1039
01:14:25,604 --> 01:14:27,560
Thank you for your time.

1040
01:14:29,108 --> 01:14:30,939
We'll be right back.

1041
01:14:36,407 --> 01:14:39,443
And there you have it, folks.

1042
01:14:39,617 --> 01:14:41,949
Decide for yourself.

1043
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,956
Hey, buddy.
Let's go.

1044
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:53,785
Come on.

1045
01:14:58,301 --> 01:15:02,340
Are you still working
for the radio station?

1046
01:15:02,514 --> 01:15:05,129
No, sir, I'm not.

1047
01:15:05,307 --> 01:15:06,296
You're not?

1048
01:15:06,475 --> 01:15:08,215
Did you leave
on your own accord

1049
01:15:08,394 --> 01:15:10,134
or were you fired?

1050
01:15:10,312 --> 01:15:12,803
I can't comment on

1051
01:15:12,982 --> 01:15:16,270
what the circumstances were
of his termination.

1052
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:18,149
So he was fired?

1053
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,061
I can't comment on
the circumstances of his termination.

1054
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:23,230
Did he leave on his own, then?

1055
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:27,112
Charlie doesn't
work here anymore.

1056
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:44,424
I was like four

1057
01:15:44,595 --> 01:15:47,506
when we went fishing
and you taught me how to fly-fish.

1058
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,218
That was-- that was fun.

1059
01:15:51,392 --> 01:15:53,178
Good memory.

1060
01:15:54,312 --> 01:15:55,927
In the '70s and '80s,

1061
01:15:56,105 --> 01:15:58,346
these conditions
were relatively self-limiting

1062
01:15:58,524 --> 01:16:00,184
by the lack of media.

1063
01:16:00,358 --> 01:16:02,349
They were limited by the lack
of communication.

1064
01:16:02,527 --> 01:16:07,021
And now with globalization
of social media, lnternet, e-mail--

1065
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:11,909
that sharing this information
would cause a public health risk.

1066
01:16:12,078 --> 01:16:14,033
My strong recommendation

1067
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:17,163
is that we keep
this information sealed

1068
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:20,541
until further research
can be done.

1069
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:33,052
Are you sure you're lying
about having any evidence

1070
01:16:33,223 --> 01:16:35,714
or are you just
keeping that to yourself

1071
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:38,224
- to maybe...
- I don't have--

1072
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,554
-...write a book
or something after this?

1073
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:43,391
Objection, objection.
Asked and answered.

1074
01:16:44,817 --> 01:16:46,899
Are you instructing him
not to answer, Counsel?

1075
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,684
I've instructed him
not to answer that.

1076
01:16:48,862 --> 01:16:51,319
We'll certify that question
to the court, then.

1077
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:07,413
Hey, Dad.

1078
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:14,416
R-R-R-Raunchy Paul!

1079
01:17:16,096 --> 01:17:18,382
I hate that show.

1080
01:17:20,016 --> 01:17:21,551
Me, too.

1081
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:34,609
I want the truth and I want it
on this deposition and I want it now.

1082
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:38,112
- Who sees this?
- Oh, well, this is a public record.

1083
01:17:38,283 --> 01:17:40,569
Anybody can see
this deposition.

1084
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:44,201
Anybody can see that you're--
how you're answering--

1085
01:17:44,372 --> 01:17:46,033
I'm sorry. I think I've given you
all the information

1086
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:47,196
I'm gonna give you today.

1087
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:48,955
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have a right to--

1088
01:17:49,126 --> 01:17:51,117
- now sit down in your seat.
- No.

1089
01:17:51,295 --> 01:17:52,751
We're not through
with the deposition.

1090
01:17:52,921 --> 01:17:54,627
You don't have
a right to get up--

1091
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:58,729
- Hey, what's up?
- Dude, I found the DVD. It's real.

1092
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:00,560
No. No way, man.

1093
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,349
You're so lying.

1094
01:19:02,527 --> 01:19:04,188
No, I'm not.

1095
01:19:04,363 --> 01:19:07,275
I'll rip you a copy.

1096
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:09,689
No, no.
Load it on YouTube.

1097
01:19:09,867 --> 01:19:12,199
- Do it right now.
- Okay, fine.

1098
01:19:14,789 --> 01:19:17,906
And that's how
the shadow people spread--

1099
01:19:18,084 --> 01:19:21,372
from person to person
around the world...

1100
01:19:23,088 --> 01:19:26,751
whether by
word of mouth, a book,

1101
01:19:26,925 --> 01:19:28,665
the Internet...

1102
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:32,795
or a movie.

1103
01:19:59,122 --> 01:20:00,658
My hands
kind of like paralyze.

1104
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:03,744
I can't move the minute
it walks into that room.

1105
01:20:05,627 --> 01:20:07,413
And when I opened my eyes,

1106
01:20:07,587 --> 01:20:11,079
there was these three
solid black shadows.

1107
01:20:11,258 --> 01:20:13,419
I'm talking solid.

1108
01:20:15,262 --> 01:20:16,718
Point to the ceiling.

1109
01:20:16,888 --> 01:20:17,922
Can't you see that?

1110
01:20:18,097 --> 01:20:20,258
Can't you see that shadow
or that person?

1111
01:20:21,434 --> 01:20:24,096
And I was in
that paralyzed state

1112
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:26,602
where it was
just my eyes moving.

1113
01:20:26,772 --> 01:20:30,105
That's all I could see in my room,
but I knew something was there.

1114
01:20:31,943 --> 01:20:33,433
I felt like something
had jumped on me.

1115
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:35,567
Whatever was there
had jumped on me.

1116
01:20:35,739 --> 01:20:36,945
It was holding me down.

1117
01:20:39,492 --> 01:20:41,073
And the next thing I know,
I'm just wide awake

1118
01:20:41,244 --> 01:20:45,031
and there's this sound,
like, resonating in my ears.

1119
01:20:54,673 --> 01:20:57,085
Sorry.

1120
01:22:14,205 --> 01:22:18,414
# Stand down #

1121
01:22:18,584 --> 01:22:22,622
# Ride that preacher train #

1122
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:28,298
# Stand down #

1123
01:22:28,468 --> 01:22:31,255
# Ride that preacher train #

# You've been looking

# Rolling fire and rain #

1126
01:22:39,311 --> 01:22:43,930
# Light the burning
heart now, higher, yeah #

1127
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:46,724
# Keep on breaking
the cage down #

1128
01:22:46,902 --> 01:22:48,983
# Grant this bird its wings #

1129
01:22:49,154 --> 01:22:51,486
# We are all together now #

1130
01:22:51,656 --> 01:22:53,612
# Come and stand by me #

1131
01:22:53,783 --> 01:22:57,275
# Stand down #

01:22:57,453 --> 01:22:59,535
# Ride, ride, yeah #

1133
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:07,251
# Stand down #

# Holy One who come down #

# Drop your heavy weight #

1137
01:23:38,617 --> 01:23:40,983
# Brother, don't you
be shouldering #

1138
01:23:41,161 --> 01:23:43,401
# All that heavy hate #

1139
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:46,070
# Holy One who come now #

1140
01:23:46,248 --> 01:23:48,455
# Truth in the sounds I play #

1141
01:23:48,626 --> 01:23:51,117
# Keep on burning
the cage down #

1142
01:23:51,295 --> 01:23:52,876
# Lover, stand by me #

1143
01:23:53,047 --> 01:23:56,630
# Stand down #
