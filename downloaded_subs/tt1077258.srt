1
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,271
They called him Machete.

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,535
$70 a day for yard work.

3
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,272
100 for roofing.

4
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,641
Get in.

5
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,239
125 for septic.

6
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,783
Sewage.

7
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,614
Have you ever killed anyone before?

8
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,722
As you may know,
illegal aliens such as yourself

9
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,555
are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate.

10
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,118
for the good of both our people.

11
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,858
Our new senator must die.

12
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,095
And for that I will pay you $150,000...

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,159
cash.

14
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,035
He was given an offer
he couldn't refuse.

15
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,936
I cost the most...

16
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,973
'cause I'm the best there is.

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,044
Aah!

18
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,681
Set up, double-crossed,

19
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,089
and left for dead.

20
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,593
I took a vow of peace.

21
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,597
And now you want me
to help you kill all these men?

22
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,257
Yes, bro.

23
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,234
I mean, Padre.

24
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,737
I'll see what I can do.

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,912
He knows the score.

26
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,474
Where are my wife and daughter?!

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,316
He gets the women.

28
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,877
He's back

29
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,321
Machete

30
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,383
And he kills the bad guys.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,256
No!

32
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,553
Oh, shit.

33
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,997
You mean that a Mexican day laborer

34
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,968
is a goddamn Federale?!

35
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,300
But they soon realized...

36
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,634
He's coming after us.

37
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,475
...they just fucked with the wrong Mexican.

38
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,872
- Uhh!
- Action.

39
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,816
Suspense.

40
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,081
Aaaah!

41
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,088
Emotion.

42
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,352
Please, Father, have mercy.

43
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,451
God has mercy. I don't.

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,695
If you're gonna
hire Machete to kill the bad guy,

45
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:53,330
you better make damn sure
the bad guy isn't you.

46
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,835
Machete

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,679
Rated "X".

48
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,717
Brought to you from your friends
at The Weinstein Company.

49
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,504
Real pretty tonight, Holly.

50
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,062
God damn it, girls.

51
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,541
If you're gonna do that shit,
do it onstage!

52
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,569
Smokin' hot. Whew!

53
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,447
Cherry, darlin',
I told you too many fuckin' times--

54
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,455
you can't be up there cryin'
and all that shit.

55
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,252
You know what a go-go dance is?

56
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,922
Useless talent number 12?

57
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,985
No, it's a happy dance.

58
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,996
You get up there
and you dance happy.

59
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,294
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

60
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,292
I'm quitting.

61
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,166
You say that
at least one night a week.

62
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,705
I mean it this time.

63
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,176
I need a dramatic change in my life.

64
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,609
I've always said you're funny.

65
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,705
Like that Chris Rock...
only prettier.

66
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,374
But if you don't stop
all that cryin' and shit,

67
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,748
I'm gonna have to fire
your fuckin' ass,

68
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,719
and I don't want to fire your ass
'cause I like lookin' at your ass.

69
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,778
"Any girl leaving early"

70
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,619
"must check out with their finger"

71
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,818
"and have a bye-bye slip."

72
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,860
Here's my finger.

73
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,059
And here's my bye-bye slip.

74
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,470
We're gonna need some cash.

75
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,861
Dick. Fuck!

76
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:17,918
Aah!

77
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,191
Oh!

78
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,707
Ass bag!

79
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,302
Aah!

80
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,562
All right, boys. Come on.

81
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,395
All right, all right. Come on.

82
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,907
You guys know the drill, huh?

83
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,945
Wait here, Lieutenant.

84
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,506
I'll handle this.

85
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,380
Hey, Abby.

86
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,817
I can see you've had
a spot of trouble, Romey.

87
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,558
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

88
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,598
Well, they--they escaped.

89
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,724
Uh...

90
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,234
All three?

91
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,770
Yeah, l--

92
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,236
I don't know, uh--

93
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,035
I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out--

94
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,803
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

95
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,735
And you know the rules.

96
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,837
Hold on.

97
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,712
I'm out.
I swear, Abby, I'm--I'm--

98
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,183
You're not gonna
see me anymore, okay?

99
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,651
Not so fast.

100
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,190
I also want your balls.

101
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,464
I'm really quite attached to them.

102
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,268
Oh, sweetheart.

103
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,866
I was really attached to my specimens.

104
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,538
Now they're out there in the night
doing God knows what.

105
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,105
I can't do it, Abby. Please.
Please, Abby.

106
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,047
Hey. Hey! What are you guys--

107
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,679
Let me go, you motherfuckers!

108
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,190
Son of a bitch!
Abby! Listen!

109
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,520
You don't need Abby!

110
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,560
There's more!

111
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,425
There's more!
I can get you all you want! Abby!

112
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,056
Fuck!. Motherfucking pussies!

113
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,464
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
I can get you more!

114
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,263
No! No! No! Aah!

115
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,930
Aaaaah!

116
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,445
Pick this up, please.

117
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,374
Where's the shit?

118
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,349
The shit's right there.

119
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,050
The deal is still good.

120
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,756
No, it's not.

121
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,853
You held out on me.

122
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,956
Now I want all of it.

123
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,184
Uhh!

124
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,623
Looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.

125
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,424
You certainly have.

126
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,521
So...

127
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,865
I'll ask you one more time.

128
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,769
Where's...

129
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,002
the...

130
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,635
shit?

131
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,304
Everywhere.

132
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,684
Oh, balls.

133
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,156
Get that thing away from my pumps!

134
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,861
It's just overheating.

135
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,966
I need to get to town.

136
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,240
It's just a stripped radiator cap.

137
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,711
Water leaks when it heats up.

138
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,550
No pressure.

139
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,952
You okay?

140
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,424
I'm just cherry.

141
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,654
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I'll be right in.

142
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,292
Here, take this with you.

143
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,063
That's your good spring water.

144
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,263
Ain't nothin' good about it.
I bottled it myself.

145
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,068
I get it right there out of the dam.

146
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,042
Thanks...

147
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,600
J.T.

148
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,509
We're serving inside tonight.

149
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,571
The best barbecue in Texas
around the clock.

150
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,911
I gotta go.

151
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,077
Savin' lives, are you?

152
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,419
Now, how did you know that?

153
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,628
Now, that's a rump roast.

154
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,428
Mmm.

155
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,309
Open the shades.

156
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,478
Get some light in here.

157
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,927
Nice night.

158
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,696
Coffee.

159
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,768
Oh, shit.

160
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,365
I couldn't get off work this week.

161
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,040
But you only have to stay till 10:00.

162
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,943
A friend of mine will be here before
10:00 to pick up Tony.

163
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,952
I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.

164
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,284
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

165
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,153
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

166
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,226
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.

167
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,763
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

168
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,098
I'll leave him watching TV.

169
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,908
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.

170
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,339
Thank you.

171
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,616
Hey, what happened to your tooth?

172
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,350
Fell out.

173
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,187
Wow.

174
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,420
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?

175
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,522
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.

176
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,363
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.

177
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,663
Amen.

178
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,772
Who was that you were talking to?

179
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,207
Babysitter.

180
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,977
She's on her way.

181
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,012
- You believe her?
- No.

182
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,014
Me, neither.

183
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,136
Fucking catastrophe.

184
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,306
- Hey.
- Hey.

185
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,035
- How's it goin', J.T.?
- All right.

186
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,414
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.

187
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,042
Cup of coffee
and a pack of cigarettes, please.

188
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,884
Free of charge.

189
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,356
Tonight...

190
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,017
is a special night.

191
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,723
What's so special about tonight?

192
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,628
Been open 25 years.

193
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,308
You should've thrown a party.

194
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,139
I did. See the balloons?

195
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,079
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

196
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,309
Who's the first?

197
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,645
Right there.

198
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,251
Must be passin' through.

199
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,021
Seems only strangers eat here.

200
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,820
I still eat here, J.T.

201
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,559
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

202
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,033
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you're eatin'.

203
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,037
Hello, Palomita.

204
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,250
I don't go by that name anymore.

205
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,781
Why not?

206
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,923
'Cause it's the name you gave me.

207
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,461
So, uh...

208
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,523
you ever become that--
that fancy doctor?

209
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,130
Never did.

210
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,437
I thought for sure you would.

211
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,471
Talked about it enough.

212
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,773
That's the problem with goals--

213
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,906
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

214
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,075
That's my jacket.

215
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,550
I looked for it for two weeks.

216
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,213
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?

217
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,053
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.

218
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,258
So, um...

219
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,762
what are you doing now?

220
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,427
I'm going to be a standup comedian.

221
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,596
Really?

222
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,404
You're not funny.

223
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,969
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody,

224
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,345
but they all say I'm hysterical.

225
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,109
But you're not.

226
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,652
Great. Well, that's just fantastic,

227
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,655
because I believed everybody,
and I've already booked shows in town.

228
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,054
Now what am I gonna do?

229
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,321
Yeah. Yeah, that--
that sucks, really.

230
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,520
There's a difference
between being frank

231
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,999
and being dick.

232
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,332
Yeah, well...

233
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,371
it was really good seeing you again.

234
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh. Um...

235
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,209
what name do you go by now...

236
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,108
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?

237
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,737
Cherry.

238
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,574
Cherry Darling.

239
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,277
Sxounds like a stripper.

240
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,754
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.

241
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,222
There's a difference.

242
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,690
Right.

243
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,851
Well...

244
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,923
you'll always be Palomita to me.

245
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,303
I need a ride.

246
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,878
What do you say, El Wray?

247
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,216
I'll give you a ride.

248
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,730
Good-bye, Bill.

249
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,064
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.

250
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,902
Hey. What's up, Doc?

251
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,076
The little lady's lookin'
pretty good there, I gotta say.

252
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,772
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.

253
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,938
I'm kiddin'. Heh.

254
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,674
- Take a look at that shit.
- What happened to your arm?

255
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,015
Well, uh... I got bit.

256
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,385
Bit? Bit by what?

257
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,788
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

258
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,750
I need some Bactine or something?

259
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:11,953
Whew.

260
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,291
Can't you just...sew it up?

261
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,062
Well, normally I would.

262
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,933
I'd even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

263
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,166
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.

264
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,037
Oh, shit. Check this out.

265
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,270
When this was still a military hospital,

266
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,370
this one guy came back
from lraq with this.

267
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,471
Whew!

268
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,709
Chronic herpetic lesions.

269
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,343
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,

270
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,579
kind of like a fountain.

271
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,144
Oh, Jesus.

272
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,746
Well, how'd you treat it?

273
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,954
Fuck that. I was never in lraq.

274
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,155
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

275
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,130
I swear to God.
I've got these lraqi eyeballs

276
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,167
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.

277
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,361
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.

278
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,960
Mustard gas--
it does that to your eyes.

279
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,437
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

280
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,337
Bot fly, do you think?

281
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,742
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

282
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,473
That looks like gout.

283
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,412
He's running a temperature of 105.

284
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,112
- Is that bad?
- It's high.

285
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,483
Bad will be 108.

286
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,149
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.

287
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,455
And--and probably die.

288
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,419
Say "ahh."

289
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,930
- Alhh.
- Oh! Jesus!

290
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,829
Oh, nice.

291
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,265
Black abscessed tongue.

292
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,826
All abscesses
should be drained, period.

293
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,869
What are you doing?

294
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,138
Shut up, Joe.

295
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,220
Baby...get the needles.

296
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,692
Be right there.

297
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,031
Right now.

298
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:57,966
Asshole.

299
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,181
It's spreading.

300
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,313
Holy shit.

301
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,515
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

302
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,057
See this?

303
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,526
This shows the advanced stages
of gangrene and epidermal rot.

304
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,256
- And this over here...
- Advanced rot?

305
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,925
...shows the swelling of tissues
and the lack of any type of circulation.

306
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,468
See, you're telling me
that you just got this bite?

307
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,004
- Yeah, just like a half hour ago.
- What I'm seeing here

308
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,370
is a deep impact wound
with several virals

309
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,102
and secondary bacterials,

310
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,236
and that, by the accumulation of
denuded tissue around the incision marks,

311
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,682
indicates that you've had this bite
for over 14 days.

312
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,411
Uh... uh, at least 14 days.

313
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,714
Could that be possible?

314
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,347
14 days? No way. I mean--

315
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,584
Well...what is today?

316
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,890
Today's Wednesday.

317
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,088
The 15th.

318
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,655
Of April.

319
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,326
Aw, hell. Can't I just get
a tetanus shot or something?

320
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,399
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

321
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,200
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?

322
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,797
It's sppreading all the way
upp to your shoulder.

323
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,605
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

324
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,770
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?

325
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,370
Well, shouldn't I get a second oppinion?

326
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,344
Hi, Joe.

327
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,642
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,

328
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,985
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.

329
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,148
These...

330
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,457
...are my friends.

331
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,653
My yellow friend...

332
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,963
- ...is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!

333
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,963
My blue friend...

334
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,525
you'll barely feel.

335
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,733
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

336
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,297
See how fast my friends work?

337
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,278
And after my red-headed friend...

338
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,440
... you'll never see me again.

339
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,507
...see me again, see me again.

340
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,623
They all react differently.

341
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,022
Now what?

342
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,090
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia--

343
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,760
in loving memoy

344
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,211
It's not the radiator.

345
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,046
Damn it.

346
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:49,933
All right.

347
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,373
Fuckin' thing.

348
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,206
Cheapp--whoa.

349
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,573
Damn light.

350
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,542
Ohh.

351
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,657
Hey. Hey!

352
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,559
Hey! Bastard!

353
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,029
Bastard!

354
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,098
Oh, thank God.

355
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,233
Oh.

356
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,137
Oh. Hey!

357
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,702
Hey! Hey!

358
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,006
Get outta
the fuckin' road, bitch!

359
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,395
Ohh! Stop!

360
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,590
Stop!

361
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,463
Please! Stop!

362
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,865
No! No!

363
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,018
What the hell was that?

364
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,317
People picking up road kill.

365
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,952
What, like an armadillo?

366
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,194
Deer.

367
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,796
You get a lot of them around here.

368
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,367
You know, I read a statistic that said...

369
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:31,933
that the eating of venison has risen
30% in the last few years.

370
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,240
60% of that's from road kill.

371
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,248
People eat road kill?

372
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,283
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

373
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,079
and a deer darts out
in front of you,

374
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,280
if you blink or brake or swerve--

375
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,084
shit, you'll just kill yourself.

376
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,647
So, what do you do?

377
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,318
Just ppick 'em off...

378
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,861
just like this.

379
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,419
Send it flying away from you.

380
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,987
Unacceptable.

381
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,589
Not really.

382
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,595
It's just a clear case of you or him.

383
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,105
Or her.

384
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,771
Oh, fuck!

385
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,339
Aah! Aah!

386
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,716
Cherry?

387
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,061
I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

388
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,531
It wasn't a deer.

389
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,632
Cherry! Cherry! No!

390
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,250
Aah!

391
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,264
Palomita.

392
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,468
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

393
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,911
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,

394
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,675
possible spinal trauma...

395
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,341
one severed limb.

396
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,180
Where's the leg?

397
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,085
Three sickos attacked her.

398
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,953
I shot at them.

399
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,188
I never miss.

400
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,857
They took the leg with them.

401
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,072
You'll have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?

402
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,513
He has to sign her in.

403
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,743
Do what, now?.

404
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,717
Well, he's with her.
He's respponsible for her.

405
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,755
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

406
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,218
Okay.

407
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,623
Okay! Fuck!

408
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,051
Hey, Block.

409
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,433
No, you do it.

410
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,400
Suit yourself.

411
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,305
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?

412
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,838
Nothing.

413
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,575
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

414
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,139
Come on, Wray.

415
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,742
You know you're not supppposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

416
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,754
Not even hunting?

417
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,188
Not even hunting.
And you know that.

418
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,850
Not with your history.

419
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:38,054
And here I stick my neck out for you.

420
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,359
I stick it out far.

421
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,161
Now you've got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?

422
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,129
A missing leg that's now missing?

423
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,297
And here you're saying
in front of everybody

424
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,204
that someone up and snatched it?

425
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,674
And that you shot at 'em with a gun

426
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,836
that you never should've had
in the first pplace?

427
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,174
And that now they're gone?

428
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,114
What if I find the leg?

429
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,446
So, now you know where it is?

430
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,510
You'll tell us where it is,
give us a full confession, you're saying?

431
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,715
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?

432
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,950
My thought exactly.

433
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,556
I know it sounds a little arrogant
puttin' upp a sign--

434
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,123
"Best damn barbecue in Texas..."

435
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,032
"Period."

436
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,266
But, hell...

437
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,501
who's gonna come in here
and argue about that?

438
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,576
Oh, yeah.
Big contest comin' up.

439
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,540
Mm.

440
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,181
I'm workin' on the perfect sauce.

441
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,247
Yeah.

442
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,987
That'll put me on the Food Channel.

443
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,050
Put this pplace back on the mapp
where it belongs.

444
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,425
I'll talk to you later.

445
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,373
Can I interest y'all in a plate of
soon-to-be-award-winnin' barbecue?

446
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,282
You're from Dinky's, ain't ya?

447
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,550
Well, you tell that sumbitch,

448
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,216
he thinks he's gonna come over here
and get my recippes...

449
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,525
well, I got a double-barreled answer
to his query right inside.

450
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,664
God damn, that's good.

451
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,530
Doctor Block!

452
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,441
Three fresh ones rollin' in!

453
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,637
Christ, you're kidding.

454
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,942
Automobile accident
off of Highway 18.

455
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,414
DOAs?

456
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,882
Have Andy pick 'em up.

457
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,647
He's already on 620
picking up another two.

458
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,316
Fucking Wednesday nights.

459
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,992
That's unsanitary, Doc.

460
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,994
Not if I'm the only one using it.

461
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,360
Helps me monitor
my state of calmness.

462
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,899
Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.

463
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:56,956
Fuck.

464
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,094
You might cut yourself pretty good.

465
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,263
Then I'd know I was not calm.

466
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,144
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?

467
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,607
Somebody call my wife.

468
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,800
DC-2?

469
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,132
Mm.

470
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,833
Yeah.

471
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,245
Well, what about
countering with atroppine?

472
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,309
Yeah.

473
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,288
Okay. Gotcha, gotcha.

474
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,783
Well, boys, I'm beat.

475
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,625
I gotta get home.
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

476
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,029
All right, then.
Thanks for the extra help, Earl.

477
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,761
Hey, Wray.

478
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,462
You in trouble again?

479
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,629
Just passin' through, I hope.

480
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,831
Well, me, too.

481
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,066
How's the wife, Earl?

482
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,541
Well, she's not too good.

483
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,704
Thanks for askin'.

484
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,341
Most of it's her own doin', you know.

485
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,510
Smokin' them goddamn cigarettes.

486
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,213
Pack a day for 40 years.

487
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,722
Yeah, she doesn't want anything
to do with, uh...chemo.

488
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,751
So...it does take its toll.

489
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,922
You don't smoke, do you, Wray?

490
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:35,924
No.

491
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,531
That's probably good.

492
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,970
See y'all.

493
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,143
You're gonna start by telling me

494
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,906
when you first started
carrying this gun.

495
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,244
And then we'll move up

496
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,750
to when you first set eyes
on this gal Cherry.

497
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,895
Okay.

498
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,894
Okay.

499
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,304
Sheriff Hague.

500
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,175
It's J.t, Sheriff.

501
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,306
J.T., how's the barbecue business?

502
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,810
Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

503
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,946
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.

504
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,421
I wish there was something
I could do.

505
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,857
Right now I ain't callin' my brother.
I'm callin' the sheriff.

506
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,293
I'm listening. What's the trouble?

507
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,661
Well. there ain't no trouble.
Not yet. anyway.

508
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,394
I got two delinquents been hangin'
around here for over an hour.

509
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,595
They won't purchase
and they won't leave.

510
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,034
Oh, never mind. Here they come.

511
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,543
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?

512
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,307
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

513
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,213
You give me that recipe, or I'll raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

514
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,751
Brother. ain't no Texan's ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.

515
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,980
That's a fact.
He'll take it to his grave.

516
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,488
I could be bleedin' like a stuck pig.
I ain't gonna tell you.

517
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,185
I could be dyin' in your arms.
I ain't gonna tell you!

518
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,989
- Heh heh heh.
- We'll see about that.

519
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,223
You gonna look.

520
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,335
or you gonna eat?

521
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,309
You called for me?

522
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,211
I need for you to see this.

523
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,108
Looks like a no-brainer.

524
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,584
What does that mean?

525
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,246
No brain.

526
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,018
Scoopped clean out of her skull.

527
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,820
Oh, oh, oh!
I know what this is.

528
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,418
Don't tell me.
Uh... Iiquefactive necrosis.

529
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,824
You think?

530
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,058
Oh, sure, yeah.

531
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,725
Thank you. That'll be all.

532
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,574
Oh...

533
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,876
Did you know she was back in town?

534
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,979
No.

535
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,619
I didn't.

536
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,724
What happened to her?

537
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,792
I don't know, baby.

538
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,197
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.

539
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,442
We have.

540
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,248
Well, yes, you have now--
she's fucking dead.

541
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,318
I mean, we--
we stopped before.

542
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,351
I--

543
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,620
I haven't talked to her in a while.

544
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,762
But you've written each other.

545
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,834
Here and there.

546
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,669
But not--

547
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,266
What are you doing?!

548
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,645
Let me see your last three messages.

549
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,448
- You have no right.
- I don't?

550
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,483
I don't have a right?

551
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,114
Show it to me.

552
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,951
Show it to me.

553
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,187
No.

554
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,494
Aah!

555
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,930
Now, that's just to take the sting off.

556
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,961
Show it to me.

557
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,029
No, please.

558
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,974
- Show... it...to... me!
- Aaahh! Aah! Aah!

559
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,774
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.

560
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,460
That's pretty fast.

561
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,301
Oh, what do I know, my love?

562
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,031
Exactly.

563
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,836
That you're a cheating, lying...

564
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,842
sack.

565
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,143
I didn't want to hurt you.

566
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,775
But you did.

567
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,216
Bill...

568
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,345
you're insane.

569
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,118
And I was afraid...

570
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,491
of what you might do to me,

571
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,394
to our son.

572
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,730
I'm the mother of your son.

573
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,257
Aah!

574
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,074
And after this one...

575
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,671
I'll never see you again.

576
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,225
Doc.

577
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,921
What?

578
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,624
You gotta see this.

579
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,291
I'll be right there.

580
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,070
Where the hell are the bodies?

581
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,080
That's what we wanted to show you.

582
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,206
They're gone.

583
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,581
They didn't just get upp
and walk out, did they?

584
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,211
Mmm-hmm

585
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,783
Shut the fuck up!

586
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,530
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!

587
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,587
What the hell's going on?

588
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,328
Alh, he was causin' a ruckus
over at Skipp's place, so I cuffed him,

589
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:22,099
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off.

590
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,766
Quit your hollerin' and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.

591
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,333
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.

592
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,641
He bit my finger clean off!

593
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,510
Fucking shit!

594
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,277
Get out there and book him,

595
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,318
'cause I'll fuckin' kill him
if I have to do it.

596
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,944
Carlos, go get him.

597
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,889
Wray, you stay put.

598
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,142
Are you sure he's in there?

599
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,711
He was.

600
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,274
Motherfucker.

601
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,080
He's gone.

602
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,353
Broke out the window.

603
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,390
Where's my finger?

604
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,982
Found your ring.

605
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,721
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?

606
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,689
I didn't get
a good look at mine.

607
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,426
That him over there?

608
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,419
Whoa! Whoa!

609
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,817
Aah!

610
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,454
Wray?

611
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,598
Fuck.

612
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,736
You motherfucker!

613
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,040
Uhh!

614
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,810
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

615
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,107
He's infected.

616
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,579
With what?

617
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,842
Everything.

618
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,646
Wray!
Dropp the fuckin' gun.

619
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,317
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?!

620
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,385
I'm gonna go get Cherry!

621
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,159
Fine. But we're taking my car.

622
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,105
I'm riding with you.

623
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,100
Don't make any sudden moves.

624
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,413
Viral infections.

625
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,657
They came pouring in.

626
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,663
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.

627
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,756
Highly contagious.

628
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,596
What do you think?

629
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,196
Self-preservation comes to mind.

630
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,763
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

631
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,407
First let me get my wife.

632
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,604
I love you, sweetie.

633
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,204
There you go, bunny rabbit.

634
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,806
Come on, come on.

635
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,545
Open up, now.

636
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,780
I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?

637
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,414
We don't want you checkin' out
right this--

638
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,220
God...damn.

639
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,219
Ramona.

640
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,695
You been fartin' like a goddamn
pack mule since I met--

641
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,755
God damn!

642
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,461
I hate to do this to you Earl.

643
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,003
but we need evey man on the job!

644
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,663
The shit has hit the fan!

645
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,834
Bring some guns...and ammo!

646
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,775
Meet me at my brother's!

647
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,312
I gotcha. I'll be there.

648
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,815
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.

649
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,009
Come on.

650
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,615
Ramona.

651
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,182
Ramona.

652
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,550
Aah!

653
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,121
Uhh!

654
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,654
Aaaah!

655
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,360
Oh, my God.

656
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,719
What the hell is goin' on?

657
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,061
Are you gonna give me a gun?

658
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,895
Are you fucking kidding me?

659
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,485
Fuck.

660
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,157
Oh! Fuck me!

661
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,626
God damn it!

662
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,425
Let's sort this shit out, boys!

663
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,835
Dumbass.

664
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:15,927
Yeah.

665
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,473
Not today! Not today!

666
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,840
Fucking Wednesday nights!

667
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,406
Aaah!

668
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,841
Uhh!

669
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,534
Palomita?

670
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,207
Get up. We're leaving.

671
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,710
I can't walk.

672
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,905
So what? Get up!

673
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,073
- Get--
- Aah!

674
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,241
Uhh!

675
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,109
Motherfucker.

676
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,813
Look at me!

677
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,082
Look at me!

678
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,857
I was gonna be a standup comedian.

679
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,553
But who's gonna laugh now?

680
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,493
Some of their best jokes
are about cripples.

681
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,655
Let's go.

682
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,358
It's not funny. It's ppathetic.

683
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,899
Would you stop cryin' over fuckin'...

684
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,127
spilled milk?

685
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,363
I have no leg!

686
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,812
Now you do.
What do you think?

687
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,685
You could carry me, Wray.

688
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,986
Yeah? You never wanted that before.

689
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:16,987
Why start now?

690
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,519
Alh-ah!

691
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,128
Uhh!

692
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,294
Alhh!

693
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,427
Uhh!

694
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,199
This is fucking ridiculous.

695
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,438
The sheriff must've
taken the others to J.T's.

696
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,608
Get in.

697
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,082
God damn it, wait for me.

698
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,463
My leg's stuck in the door!

699
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,473
- It's just wood.
- It's splintering.

700
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,304
Will you just leave it alone?

701
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,809
Why is this happening to me?

702
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,778
I don't know. Just--
just do me a favor right now and just...

703
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,644
stay strong.

704
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,417
"Stay"?

705
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,954
Yeah, baby. Stay.

706
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,748
Okay, my name is Electra.

707
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,020
Fucking listen.

708
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,721
My name is Electra.
Her name is Electra, too.

709
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,892
It's furry.

710
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:32,865
No.

711
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,631
He's a furry one.

712
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,138
She goes by Lia, I go by El.
El from "Electra", Ame from "Amelia".

713
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,300
Does that make
any fucking sense in your head?

714
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,979
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want--I don't give a shit.

715
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,156
Oye. chica.

716
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,919
- You said 10:00!
- I'm sorry.

717
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,153
We can't be watching your kid
all goddamn night!

718
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,719
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!

719
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,321
That's right.

720
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,367
Then start doing it.

721
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,097
Oh!

722
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,833
Uhh!

723
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,407
Tony! We're leaving!

724
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,639
Wait, my tarantula.

725
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,578
Bring it. Let's go.

726
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,013
And my turtle.

727
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:21,808
And my scorppion.

728
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,184
We're not all octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

729
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,688
"Octopi."

730
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,691
Ohh...come on, let's go.

731
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,426
Tony, what did I tell you?

732
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,230
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

733
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,771
It's okay. They can live
in the same tank.

734
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,399
What about my pocket bike?

735
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,772
It's in the trunk.

736
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,242
Aah!

737
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,609
Where do you think you're going,
you fucking bitch?!

738
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,840
We're gonna fuckin' kill you!

739
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,760
Are you sure you want to do this?

740
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,900
Everybody grab a badge and a gun.

741
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:21,375
You're all deputies
as of this moment foitward.

742
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,036
Except for you, Wray.

743
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:32,881
Yo.

744
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,321
What do we got?

745
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,155
Something's wrong up there.

746
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,361
J.T. always comes out and greets.

747
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,522
Let's go.

748
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,734
Try not to shoot yourselves.

749
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,731
Don't shoot each other.

750
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,304
But especially...

751
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,242
don't shoot me.

752
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,818
J.T.?

753
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,392
Go on! Get off him, Rusty!

754
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,398
God damn, J.T.

755
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,894
Yah!

756
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,310
Barbecue?

757
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,716
Asshole.

758
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,155
Damn good sausage link, J.T.

759
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,953
Best in Texas.

760
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,187
Must've passed out
after I killed those things.

761
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,254
Nice shootin'.

762
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,629
Everybody gather up supplies.

763
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,258
We head out in 20!

764
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,464
I think I nailed it.

765
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,599
Holy shit, I think I finally cracked it.

766
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:03,009
I finally found my--
my award-winning barbecue sauce!

767
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,080
Your blood's in it.

768
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,186
God damn it, he's right.

769
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,635
Hey, my other tooth fell out.

770
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,473
Heh.

771
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,603
It sure did.

772
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,643
Hey, your tooth fell out, too.

773
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,584
We're toothless buddies.

774
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,090
Oh, we sure are.

775
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,067
I want you to open that for Mommy.

776
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,698
Now, take the gun.

777
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,740
Careful.

778
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,644
And if anyone comes to the door
that isn't me,

779
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,739
I want you to shoot them, okay?

780
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,841
I'm not kidding, Tony.

781
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,580
You shoot them...

782
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,679
just like your video games.

783
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,691
You shoot them in the head.

784
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,624
What if it's Dad?

785
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,720
Especially if it's your dad.

786
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,409
And be careful
where you point that thing.

787
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,843
You'll blow your own face off.

788
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,710
I'll be right back.

789
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,511
I love you.

790
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,294
Tony!

791
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,067
Aah!

792
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,474
Hello, baby.

793
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,308
Ohh!

794
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,828
I'm gonna eat your brains...

795
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,228
and gain your knowledge.

796
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,096
Stay away!

797
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,805
Look what you did to our son!

798
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,578
Stay away!

799
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,050
God damn it, I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

800
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,094
Daddy!

801
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,424
Get your sorry ass in here!

802
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,488
Aah!

803
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,096
If it's escape vehicles you want,
escape vehicles I got.

804
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,469
Right this way.

805
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,636
Watch that meat.

806
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,107
Meet my wife.

807
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,936
Jesse James Custom Dominator.

808
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,414
I made Jesse a pplate of barbecue
so goddamn good,

809
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,917
he made this baby for me
free of fuckin' charge. Heh heh heh.

810
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,011
Got anything that could
transpport more peopple?

811
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,780
Where's the top?

812
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,088
This baby's chopped permanent.

813
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,186
Ain't got no roll bar, chicken wire,
none of that shit.

814
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,196
- No protection.
- But she's fast.

815
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,234
Nitrous-injected,
350-horsepower engine.

816
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,132
Who are you?

817
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,261
I mean, really.

818
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,566
Wray's Wreckage.

819
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,631
That's what it says on your truck.

820
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,672
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

821
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,579
I'm nobody.

822
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,983
It's the easiest thing to remember.

823
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,351
So remember it.

824
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,786
Just stack 'em
on top of the counter.

825
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,725
Hey, you want some barbecue?

826
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,926
Heh heh heh. Best in Texas.

827
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,525
Aw, no, thanks.

828
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,195
What's the matter,
you don't eat meat?

829
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,932
Oh, I eat meat.

830
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:26,440
I also eat lots of shit.

831
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,306
You see this?

832
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,571
What's that?

833
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:30,942
Shit-eating grin.

834
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,476
You ought to be a comedian.

835
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,949
What do you think of the leg?

836
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,248
Oh, that's funny.

837
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,346
How's your stump?

838
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,289
They knocked it out something fierce.

839
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,519
Still can't feel a thing.

840
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,827
This must be the real Bone Shack.

841
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,228
Old J.T. knows how to live.

842
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,702
Like fuck he does.

843
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,473
I like how you say "fuck".

844
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,602
Good. Fuck you.

845
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,876
Fuck me?

846
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,246
Oh, so, now you're the comedian.

847
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,550
Go ahead, drop your pants.

848
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,784
That'll be good for a laugh.

849
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,258
I highly doubt that.

850
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,392
That's my jacket.

851
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,403
Yes, I know.

852
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,439
I looked for it for two weeks.

853
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:35,333
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick::.

854
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,641
I was walking out on you.

855
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:41,046
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

856
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,814
So, if you're gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants

857
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,821
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,

858
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:50,120
'cause I'd rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

859
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,124
Did you find what was in the pock:et?

860
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,858
Fuck no.

861
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,297
Look for it.

862
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,035
No, the other one.

863
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,213
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.

864
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,410
You took the jacket.

865
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,853
And I looked for it for two weeks.

866
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,217
Read it.

867
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,865
"Two against the world."

868
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,970
Remember that?

869
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,200
I never forgot it.

870
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,635
Then why'd you leave?

871
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,145
Because you didn't believe in us,

872
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,616
or in me.

873
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,335
I figured one of them new deputies
might end up shootin' me,

874
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,030
but not you, Tolo!

875
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,595
Sorry. I'm sorry.

876
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,572
- Dumbass.
- You're gonna be all right.

877
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,132
- McGraw's here.
-  Now, now, now.

878
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,337
- And a whole bunch of others.
- Everybody in!

879
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:24,401
Come on!

880
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,970
Over here.

881
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,674
Move your ass! Come on!

882
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,766
What did I tell you, Tony?

883
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,204
Don't point the gun at yourself.

884
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,976
Didn't I tell you that?

885
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,606
Thank you for telling me about...

886
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,738
you know.

887
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,679
Don't mention it.

888
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,581
That's an order.

889
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,346
If I had known that you were...

890
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:08,848
El Wray...

891
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,188
I wouldn't have given you
such a hard time.

892
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,887
I didn't mean to be a prick about it.

893
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,454
Need-to-know basis, that kind of shit.

894
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,863
Take this.

895
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,694
Do what you do best.

896
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,873
No, you're not!

897
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,340
Don't give him the gun. Not--

898
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,933
Give him the gun, Tolo.

899
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,605
Give him the gun.

900
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,341
Give him all the guns.

901
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,565
Holy shit.

902
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,027
That boy's got the devil in him.

903
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,331
We gotta fight them off.

904
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,743
Get to our vehicles.

905
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,805
Everyone behind me!

906
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,648
Outside now!

907
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:37,805
God damn you!

908
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,125
Everybody back inside!

909
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,726
You, Skip.

910
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:01,770
Front and center.

911
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:05,568
You go out front,
start up the Kill Dozer.

912
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,768
We'll need it to transport
the other survivors.

913
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,277
You fuckin' crazy?
I'm not goin' out there.

914
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,779
- I'll cover you.
- I'm not goin'.

915
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:14,281
I never miss.

916
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,318
Come on, Skipp.

917
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,250
It's go-go.

918
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,220
Not cry-cry.

919
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,314
Cherry!

920
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,126
Oh, dear.

921
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,205
Alh!

922
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:00,784
Aah!

923
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,843
J.T.!

924
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,715
You take whoever you can fit
in your convertible.

925
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,878
Everyone else on board!

926
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,547
Skipp, grab the ttwins!
Come along with me!

927
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,886
You take the chopper.

928
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,586
I need someone else
to drive my truck!

929
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,991
I'll do it.

930
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,057
You're bleedin' like a stuck pig.

931
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,225
Your vision's blurred
and you're on your last legs.

932
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,598
Anything else?

933
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,193
Don't wreck it.

934
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,105
Somebody grab the slaw!

935
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:47,039
You can't have no barbecue
without coleslaw!

936
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,667
- Give me a gun.
- Take this.

937
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:50,906
Fucking cool!

938
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,940
All right, y'all, head out.
I'll hold 'em off.

939
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:58,945
I can take care of myself.

940
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,215
Bye, Daddy.

941
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:04,482
Do you remember how to ride a bike?

942
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,323
Useless talent number 32.

943
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,654
Good.

944
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,460
Anyone else have a car?

945
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,402
Now, you're sure you're okay
driving this thing?

946
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,804
Hell yeah.

947
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,404
Dakota...
we're sorry about Tony.

948
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,306
Thanks.

949
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,907
Your engine is shot
and you've got three blown tires.

950
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,976
But I've got his ppocket bike
in the trunk.

951
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,221
Is it fast?

952
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,282
Zero to fifty in four seconds.

953
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,293
You ride with her.

954
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,057
I'm Cherry.

955
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,655
You sure are.

956
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,461
Move out!

957
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:48,559
Damn shame.

958
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,494
Rusty!

959
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,436
Aah!

960
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,940
God damn it!

961
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:27,998
Aah!

962
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:07,246
Sheriff! How much ammo we got?

963
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,651
Not enough.

964
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,931
Don't shoot!
We're not infected!

965
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:37,639
All survivors gotta come with us.

966
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,341
Especially you...

967
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,346
El Wray.

968
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,853
I don't go by that name anymore.

969
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,365
It's okay. It's okay.

970
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,634
We're here in quarantine
with the other survivors.

971
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:18,181
Where is here?

972
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,083
The old army base.

973
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,924
El Wray?

974
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,891
That you?

975
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:30,888
He's with them.
I saw him in their convoy earlier.

976
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,729
I'm a scientist...

977
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,235
and a businessman.
Not military.

978
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:39,001
Which is why he's gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

979
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,804
They're stealing biochemical weapons.

980
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:44,173
DC-2?

981
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,612
Also known as "Project Terror."

982
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,715
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area.

983
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,754
You were supplying it to them.

984
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:57,082
- That's why they shut you out.
- They found my supply.

985
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,127
It's under our feet.

986
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,128
Ten stories down.

987
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,630
What about countering
with atropine and PAM-2?

988
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:07,567
Interferes with the neurotoxic delivery,
sets off the cell-blaster,

989
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:11,094
and you're gushing blood and pus
through every sacred hole in your body.

990
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,606
Apetizing.

991
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:16,303
The only treatment
is a regimented exposure to DC-2 itself.

992
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,936
It delays the negative effects.

993
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,480
They need it...

994
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:21,810
Iike a drug.

995
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:24,444
Correct. But we found that
a small percentage of people

996
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,681
are not affected by the gas itself,

997
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:29,280
and within this small percentage
lies a cure.

998
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,985
What do you want to do?

999
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,657
Mexico.

1000
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,527
Put our backs against the ocean

1001
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,191
and defend ourselves from there.

1002
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:41,132
No. We have to get back to my lab.

1003
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,194
This infection will sppread
all over the world,

1004
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,263
to every man, woman and child,

1005
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,898
unless I finish my antidote.

1006
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,636
You have an antidote?

1007
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,286
You! You!

1008
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:00,252
Come with us.

1009
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,581
Move it!

1010
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,823
Move it, Peggy!

1011
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,161
Uhh!

1012
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,172
Do you like Ava Gardner?

1013
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,507
I'm sorry?

1014
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:33,010
Ava Gardner.
Do you like her?

1015
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,089
Yeah, I guess.

1016
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,018
I was just thinking that you, uh...

1017
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,119
kind of look like Ava Gardner
a little bit.

1018
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,095
You got something
you want to say to me?

1019
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,137
I have nothing to say to you.

1020
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,109
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.

1021
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,204
'Cause I could've swore you just
gave me a "fuck you" look right now.

1022
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:01,606
You want to say "fuck you" to me?

1023
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,842
Not at this moment.

1024
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,079
You know what this is?

1025
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,149
A gun.

1026
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,319
It's simplicity itself.

1027
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,321
You see, you point it
at what you want to die...

1028
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:19,256
and you pull the little trigger here...

1029
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:22,400
and a little bullet comes out of here.

1030
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,736
And the little bullet
hits you right there.

1031
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,036
And you know what?

1032
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,802
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

1033
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,412
Don't taunt me, tramp.

1034
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,787
I am not one to be taunted.

1035
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:43,983
You got it?

1036
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,089
Let me here you say, "l got it."

1037
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,496
I got it.

1038
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,431
You damn well better.

1039
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,742
Tool.

1040
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,048
God damn it, that's it.

1041
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,614
I figured it out.

1042
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,051
Salt.

1043
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,590
Got it all figured out. It's salt.

1044
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,148
Blood is salty.

1045
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:20,660
That's all my sauce needed,
was just a little more salt.

1046
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,825
It just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

1047
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,024
What are you doing, J.T.?

1048
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,034
That's all I gotta do,
is put a little more salt in.

1049
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:29,433
It'd just do the same goddamn thing
that the blood did.

1050
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,904
I tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

1051
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,873
Don't do nothin' stuppid, J.T.
I got it covered.

1052
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,911
It's already got my sweat, it's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!

1053
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:41,979
- Dropp the gun!
- J.T.!

1054
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,175
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay!

1055
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:46,652
Don't shoot!

1056
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,882
J.T., you all right?

1057
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,386
Uhh!

1058
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,023
Hey, you all right, bro?

1059
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:00,965
God damn it,
I'm not all right at all, brother.

1060
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,469
Not at all.

1061
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,164
Wait here.

1062
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,400
Oh...I sure will.

1063
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,478
Goddamn sauce.

1064
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,019
"Women in Cages".

1065
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,886
See them in action.

1066
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,224
See them in love.

1067
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,762
See them in terror.

1068
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,390
White skin on the black market.

1069
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:34,663
Soft flesh for hard cash.

1070
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,795
"Women in Cages. "

1071
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:38,999
I'm gonna go get my dick wet.

1072
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,269
She's got one leg.

1073
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,004
Easier access.

1074
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,444
You got a point.

1075
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,255
Get the rest of this shit uppstairs
and we'll blow this entire floor.

1076
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:57,313
Yes, sir.

1077
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,836
Get Lewis down here.

1078
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,435
He's getting his dick wet, sir.

1079
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:18,672
Get him the fuck down here now!

1080
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,488
Lewis?

1081
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:31,617
Wilson?

1082
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:48,735
Where are my men?

1083
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,903
I've got several right here.

1084
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:54,680
What the fuck's this?

1085
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,978
Their balls, sweetheart.

1086
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:02,953
I'm walking out of here
with this shit, Wray.

1087
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,254
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.

1088
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:06,351
Because I earned it.

1089
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:07,985
How do you figure that?

1090
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:11,362
You want the story?
I'll spin it for you quick.

1091
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:14,300
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,

1092
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,497
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands

1093
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:21,303
and our balls in our throats,
lookin' for America's most wanted.

1094
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,866
- Bin Laden.
- Yeah.

1095
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,071
For once, our intel
was right on the money.

1096
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:26,374
I come around a corner--

1097
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:28,382
bam, there he is,
lookin' me right in the eyes.

1098
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,576
Wait.

1099
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:31,619
You killed bin Laden?

1100
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:35,053
I put ttwo in his heart,
one in his compputer.

1101
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:37,147
So that was you.

1102
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,522
Yeah.

1103
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:40,691
That was me.

1104
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:44,821
Class-A clusterfuck.

1105
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,199
He wasn't supposed to be there,
we weren't supposed to be there,

1106
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:52,104
and I sure as fuck wasn't supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket.

1107
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:56,075
So, instead of a chest full of medals,
we get a face full of DC-2.

1108
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:58,304
No cure.

1109
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,814
That is, not until we found
somebody from the other side

1110
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,907
willing to sell us batches of this shit.

1111
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,249
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.

1112
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,813
Then you realized if you could
infect a large enough populace,

1113
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:13,019
the experiment and its survivors,

1114
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,755
you'd find a cure.

1115
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:17,525
I swore to my men
that I'd do everything in my power

1116
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,089
to keepp them alive.

1117
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,327
And that's what I intend to do, Wray.

1118
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:24,869
Understand?

1119
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,740
I never had a choice.

1120
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,145
Neither do l, sir.

1121
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,985
God bless you
and your service to this country.

1122
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:46,056
You're a doctor?

1123
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:47,853
Heh.

1124
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,695
I was earlier tonight.

1125
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,831
I always wanted to be a doctor.

1126
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:58,134
Instead, I can do...

1127
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,605
this.

1128
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,542
Ohh. Useless talent number 66.

1129
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:08,844
I'm very pliable.

1130
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,544
A girlfriend of mine
had a theory.

1131
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:14,054
She said at some point in your life,

1132
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:17,319
you find a use for every useless talent
you ever had.

1133
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:20,352
It's like, uh, connecting the dots.

1134
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,760
I'm not that optimistic.

1135
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,392
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.

1136
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:27,730
She'd say...

1137
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,571
when you're stuck in that spiral...

1138
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:32,938
you reach up.

1139
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:36,643
What if there's nothing up there?

1140
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,274
Just reach up.

1141
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:42,344
You're a dancer.

1142
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,918
I was earlier tonight.

1143
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,580
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement!

1144
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,385
Get your ass up!

1145
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:57,787
Now, I'm starved for entertainment, baby,
and that means you.

1146
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:58,855
Radio!

1147
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,593
Wail, baby, now!

1148
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,943
' to a pay...

1149
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,000
That's--

1150
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,910
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1151
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,144
Dance it up.

1152
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,253
Keep dancing!

1153
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,683
'Cause now. I'm jaded...

1154
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:25,487
I have seen me
some crazy ass shit in my day...

1155
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,896
but ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

1156
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,694
I have seen me a stripper
with one breast,

1157
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,736
and I've seen me a stripper
with 12 toes,

1158
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,328
and I've seen me a stripper
with no brains at all,

1159
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:41,534
but I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

1160
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:43,543
And I've been to Morocco.

1161
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:46,375
Dance, bitch!

1162
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,946
Break a leg!

1163
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,078
Break it off! Ha ha!

1164
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,727
Dance for me, motherfucker.

1165
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,664
- Uhh!
- Aaaaah!

1166
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:07,428
Aah!

1167
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:10,198
Ohhhh!

1168
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:20,907
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

1169
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,506
Actually, yes.

1170
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,553
You gave me some wood,

1171
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,611
now I'm gonna give you...

1172
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:30,715
some fuckin' wood!

1173
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,760
Alh--ah!

1174
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:43,204
Alhh!

1175
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,796
The gas! You need your gas!

1176
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,933
No! Fuck the gas, fuck it.

1177
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:50,443
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.

1178
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,154
Aah!

1179
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,452
Uhh!

1180
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:06,459
Where'd you get that?

1181
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:08,688
Useless talent number 37.

1182
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:11,826
Aaaaah!

1183
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,443
Uhh! Uhh!

1184
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:36,852
I broke my leg.

1185
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:39,655
That's okay.
I made you something.

1186
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:44,523
I do believe in you.

1187
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:46,765
Always have.

1188
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:49,428
I believe that you could be better.

1189
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,802
You deserve better,

1190
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,534
even better than me.

1191
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:55,637
Right now,

1192
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,644
I need you to become...

1193
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,807
who you're meant to be.

1194
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:02,910
Stand.

1195
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,821
I'd stand clear if I were you.

1196
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,292
Oppen that door, will you, baby?

1197
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,745
Uhh!

1198
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,622
They've destroyed most of the tanks.

1199
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,991
Any that are left
we'll get on our way to the helicoppters.

1200
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:55,297
There are two helicopters,

1201
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,395
big enough to take all of us.

1202
01:27:58,840 --> 01:27:59,966
Who can fly?

1203
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,511
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

1204
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,172
I can fly, but...

1205
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,216
no way in hell I'm gonna fly tonight.

1206
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,081
Okay. Cool.

1207
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:12,413
I'll fly.

1208
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:14,915
Let's go.

1209
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:22,859
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

1210
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:25,794
You'll take care of this for me,
then, Sheriff?

1211
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:28,729
With pleasure.

1212
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,065
Three minutes.

1213
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:33,166
Your brother's a good man, J.T.

1214
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:34,833
Best in Texas.

1215
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:39,205
Hop on.

1216
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:43,882
No, the other way.

1217
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,248
Oh.

1218
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,449
No. The other way.

1219
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:40,072
The helicopters are
on the other side of this wall.

1220
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,310
We make a run for it!

1221
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,546
No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

1222
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:52,880
Don't you get it?

1223
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,478
We're the antidote.

1224
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,046
Well, is there another way around?

1225
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:59,058
Wait here.

1226
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:29,120
I don't suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around? Heh.

1227
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,851
Take that as a no.

1228
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:34,454
We have to get over that wall!

1229
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:41,034
I was thinkin' we could build us
a new place,

1230
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,229
right there where the old one was.

1231
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,663
You cook,

1232
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,367
I work the back.

1233
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:51,941
You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.

1234
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:55,346
We share the recippe,
we share the rent.

1235
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,786
Start at 250 degrees.

1236
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:07,517
I knew it.

1237
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,062
For how long?

1238
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,530
- 12 pounds?
- Sure.

1239
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:13,794
12 pounds, 12 hours.

1240
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:15,960
Wrapped in tin foil, right?

1241
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:18,164
I don't use no goddamn foil.

1242
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:19,263
Damn.

1243
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:21,603
Tomatoes? Fresh?

1244
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:24,009
Canned.

1245
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:25,739
- No shit?
- Yeah.

1246
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:27,041
You score me some?

1247
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:28,638
Oh, yeah.

1248
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,717
'Cause we're brothers.

1249
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:34,547
Thank you for this.

1250
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:36,180
You just remember...

1251
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:39,158
you got to take this recipe
to your grave.

1252
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:43,424
I think I can...
goddamn guarantee that.

1253
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:09,948
That's our cue.

1254
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:13,987
Cherry, darling...

1255
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:17,229
it's all you.

1256
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:49,825
Let's go!

1257
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:56,791
Aah!

1258
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:58,958
Wray!

1259
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:03,831
Damn it, Wray.

1260
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,132
Ohh.

1261
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:09,434
Okay. You need to get up
'cause we're leaving.

1262
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:36,435
They told me I'd find you here.

1263
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:42,675
I was beginning to lose hope.

1264
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,540
I'm sorry...

1265
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,341
but I lied.

1266
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:53,379
I did want to hurt you.

1267
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:56,887
My turn.

1268
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:10,998
No more dead bodies
for Daddy tonight.

1269
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:15,064
Never did like that son of a bitch.

1270
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:21,144
About as useless
as a pecker on a pope.

1271
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:28,514
Don't touch anything.

1272
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:29,884
I want to fly it.

1273
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:32,187
- He said not to touch anything!
- You don't know what you're doing!

1274
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:33,487
- I do know what I'm doing!
- No, you don't!

1275
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,825
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up, sit down...

1276
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:37,693
and don't fuckin' touch anything!

1277
01:35:44,205 --> 01:35:45,331
Everybody sit down!

1278
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:53,703
Whoo!

1279
01:36:02,056 --> 01:36:03,114
Hit the wipers.

1280
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:10,453
Go on, leave me.

1281
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:13,193
I am not leaving you here like this.

1282
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:16,168
Motherfuckers around here
eat road kill.

1283
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:20,634
See? I'm funny.

1284
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,002
I made you laugh.

1285
01:36:23,077 --> 01:36:24,237
Go to the ocean.

1286
01:36:24,345 --> 01:36:27,371
Put your bacs to it.
Protect yourselves there.

1287
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:30,144
I'm not leaving you, Wray.

1288
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:33,513
It's two against the world.

1289
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,381
It will be.

1290
01:36:37,892 --> 01:36:39,291
I promise.

1291
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:41,924
I never miss.

1292
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,161
Don't worry, baby.

1293
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,068
You'll find your way.

1294
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:06,575
Reach up!

1295
01:37:18,465 --> 01:37:20,865
Reach up!

1296
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:09,614
It's like you said
it would be, Wray.

1297
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:14,279
I'm like you said I would be.

1298
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:16,016
I find the lost...

1299
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,288
the weary...

1300
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:21,584
those that have no hoppe.

1301
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:24,654
I find them and I lead them...

1302
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:28,157
to a land we've made for ourselves.

1303
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:31,504
The land by the sea.

1304
01:39:05,873 --> 01:39:07,636
It's beautiful.

1305
01:39:08,642 --> 01:39:11,042
She's beautiful.

1306
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:16,676
I wish you could see us, us two.

1307
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:19,516
It's like you said it would be.

1308
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,813
Two against the world, baby.

1309
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:25,521
Two against the world.

1310
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:30,169
See the pyramids along the Nile
