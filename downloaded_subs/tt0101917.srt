1
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,287
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

2
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:27,527
This is the pilot speaking

3
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,967
You'll notice the "fasten
seat belts" sign is on

4
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,047
Passing through
a little turbulence here

5
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:35,407
Unfortunately,
we can't get up over it

6
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,487
and we can't
get underneath it, so

7
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:39,607
just hang in there

8
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:40,767
Excuse me, miss?

9
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:45,807
Can I have
a different seat, please?

10
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,647
Oh, I'm afraid
we're full tonight, sir

11
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,167
You're gonna have to stay put

12
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,247
Thanks anyway

13
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,367
He's going to make you
help him

14
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:21,927
because you're the last

15
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,327
Listen

16
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,927
I really need
to change this seat

17
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,167
I'm sorry
There's nothing I can do

18
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,687
I'm afraid of heights

19
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:43,847
Don't be a pussy

20
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:55,527
It's not fair! I was almost out!

21
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,647
Shit!

22
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,847
I'll get you, my pretty

23
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,087
and your little soul, too!

24
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,007
One ticket

25
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:42,207
Round trip

26
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,367
Hurry up, boy

27
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:48,127
You don't wanna miss the bus

28
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,967
No screaming
while the bus in in motion

29
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:51,127
Now be a good little doggy

30
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,927
and go fetch!

31
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:12,767
Spencer, I wanna make sure
you understand our situation

32
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:15,527
In one week,
you walk out of here

33
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,927
and I expect some changes in
your behavior when you get home

34
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:21,447
I know you're hearing me

35
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:23,447
I put you in here
because you gave me no choice

36
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:26,007
Next time, I'll leave you here

37
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,167
Thanks for the visit, Dad

38
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,127
Nice job on my kid

39
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,847
I expected to see
some improvement

40
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:36,287
He isn't a Toyota

41
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:37,967
What a jerk

42
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,167
You OK?

43
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:47,847
Yeah Dad just came by
to lay down some ground rules

44
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,967
for when I come home...

45
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,887
no more running away, no more
setting his cars on fire

46
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,007
There are other ways
to get his attention

47
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,447
besides blowing up the garage

48
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:55,887
Yeah He barely even blinked

49
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:59,887
All he wants me to do now
is grow up to be him...

50
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,767
an exact copy

51
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,407
I don't feel like playing
football and date-raping coeds

52
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,807
One of these days, you're going
to have to face your father

53
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:07,927
Maggie

54
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,487
look what I found
in Spencer's room

55
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,127
A pipe bomb, huh?

56
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:17,167
That? Just showing the kids
survival techniques

57
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,487
Been confiscating stuff
like this all week

58
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:25,927
Where do they get it?

59
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,247
I'll put this downstairs
with the rest of the arsenal

60
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,287
Weren't the police supposed
to dispose of that stuff?

61
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,967
The police are supposed
to do a lot of things

62
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,127
-Get your hands off of me!
-Tracy!

63
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,287
-What's the problem?
-She was beating on another kid

64
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,487
He was hitting on me!

65
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,407
She doesn't like
to be touched

66
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,327
We have a session today, yes?

67
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,807
I have Doc's class

68
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:45,967
Work around him

69
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,527
I'm sorry, sir

70
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,087
You seen this junkie before?

71
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,167
No He's new

72
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:00,967
Beautiful Another afternoon
shot doing juvie paperwork

73
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,167
Screw that shit

74
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,327
Let's just scoop him up
and take him to the shelter

75
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,447
Let the bleeding hearts
do the typing

76
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,287
That's it Come on, Tracy
That's it

77
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,727
Oh, yeah She's bad
The crowd loves her!

78
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:14,847
She's getting ready

79
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,007
for the heavyweight champion
boxing match of the world

80
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,447
Hey, hey, hey Look at her go

81
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:21,007
You know, you are sexy
when you sweat

82
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,367
You ain't gettin' none, Carlos!

83
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:27,487
You wouldn't hit a guy
with a handicap, would you?

84
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,847
Oh, you call it a handicap?

85
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,527
I call it chicken, man!
Come on, let's spar

86
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,847
-No, no Forget it, Trace
-Come on...

87
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:41,207
Don't tune out Why don't you
talk back to her for once?

88
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:43,407
Oh, yeah, right Like you
talk back to your father?

89
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:46,087
Let me tell you something
I stopped talking back

90
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:48,087
when it became hazardous
to my health, you know?

91
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:50,967
So, are we set?

92
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:53,647
Yeah No problem
I gave the van driver our cash

93
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,527
As long as we do it before dawn,
we're home free

94
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:59,047
We're gonna be livin' large
in Cali before the week is out

95
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,487
You better be sure, man

96
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:03,087
Trust me, all right?
I got it all covered

97
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,087
I need to get outta here
even more than you do

98
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,287
You don't know shit
about needing to get out!

99
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,847
Your family's a picnic,
rich boy!

100
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,447
What? You think I hang around
you morons by choice?

101
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,007
Least your father
didn't try to set you up

102
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,807
with his girlfriend's
older sister

103
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:16,527
Don't talk to me about fathers

104
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,887
Yours come to visit, too?

105
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,927
Yeah...
every time I close my eyes

106
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:36,087
That did it Yep OK

107
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:37,567
They caught
one of your star pupils

108
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,447
beating up
on one of our kids again

109
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,967
Thought you said
you were making progress

110
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,087
I only get twenty-three minutes
a week with these kids

111
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:46,527
With that kind of attention

112
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,967
you're lucky
she didn't kill him

113
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,247
That's a good attitude
for a therapist

114
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,807
Tracy's got some deep trauma
buried inside of her head

115
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,287
Conventional therapy
is not going to work

116
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,567
And dream therapy is, huh?

117
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:00,927
You're such a hippie

118
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:04,407
I can reach these kids
through their dreams

119
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,367
You give me a chance, I can help
you with your little problem

120
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,287
I don't have a little problem

121
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:10,527
I just have
a little reoccurring dream

122
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,127
and I'm handling it fine

123
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,487
And you are not being paid
to be a dream doctor

124
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,927
I'm barely being paid

125
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,567
That's why I gotta do
what I think is right

126
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:18,927
This is new

127
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,087
You like it?

128
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,607
These are ancient dream demons

129
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:27,327
Supposedly they roam
the dreams of the living

130
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:31,127
till they find
the most evil, twisted

131
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,407
human imaginable

132
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,647
Then they give him
the power to cross the line

133
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,967
and turn our nightmares
into reality

134
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,527
Maggie, cops just brought in
another kid Real mess

135
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,287
Hasn't sleep for days,
bad case of amnesia

136
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:46,967
We need your evaluation
right away

137
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,047
How long have you been awake?

138
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:54,687
As far as I can remember?

139
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:56,887
I don't know About three days

140
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,767
Looks more like three weeks

141
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:05,327
Yeah, well,
that's the wonder of amnesia...

142
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,687
always keeps you guessing

143
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,007
Where you from?

144
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:10,767
I don't know!

145
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,487
All I know
is that wherever I'm from

146
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:16,767
I was the last

147
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:17,967
The last what?

148
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,127
Survivor

149
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,367
Look, do you have any

150
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:26,367
caffeine pills or coffee?
Maybe some coke?

151
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,647
I meant the soda

152
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,527
Sit down

153
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:45,847
Why do you want to stay awake?

154
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,567
Because if I fall asleep

155
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,527
I'm not waking up

156
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:51,647
Why do you think that?

157
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:54,247
I don't think it I feel it

158
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,047
If I fall asleep

159
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:00,447
there's gonna be trouble

160
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,607
Springwood

161
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:09,447
Water tower

162
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:19,567
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

163
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,887
Bottles of beer on the wall

164
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:26,487
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

165
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:28,287
Bottles of beer

166
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:33,367
If one of those bottles
should happen to fall

167
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:35,887
What a case of...

168
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,367
Hey, I'll break a bottle
over your head

169
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:39,327
if you don't shut the fuck up!

170
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:46,487
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-six

171
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,887
Bottles of beer on the wall

172
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,207
I won't tell

173
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:13,207
Now you're it

174
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,607
Remember what you have to do

175
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,127
You got to tag me

176
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:18,247
That's it

177
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,167
Come to Daddy

178
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,327
Play with me

179
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,927
Tell me who I am

180
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,487
I won't tell

181
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,447
Free me, you idiot!
I'm your fucking memory!

182
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:05,487
Oh, shit

183
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:08,687
Asshole

184
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,047
What were you dreaming about?

185
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:17,007
A room

186
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,772
A house

187
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,327
A little girl

188
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:24,367
Something about the town
from my article

189
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,367
I remember a water tower

190
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,407
The article... do you remember
where you got it?

191
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,207
The little girl...
what did she look like?

192
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,967
Brown hair with

193
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,367
red ribbons

194
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:45,647
I don't like it

195
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:48,207
There's some connection between
your dreams and his dreams

196
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,687
and his dreams mean bad news

197
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,767
I know you think I'm crazy,
but I can feel it

198
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,687
Why can't anybody talk about
anything but dreams around here?

199
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,047
I'm so sick of hearing
about this bullshit!

200
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,167
You don't believe that

201
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,567
You think solving this boy's
puzzle can help with your own

202
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,007
I don't have a puzzle

203
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:07,047
Yes, you do

204
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,447
And although you think
you know everything

205
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:11,087
you may not be ready to face
what this boy will show you

206
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,727
I never said I wanted
to go back there

207
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,612
I've dealt
with amnesiacs before

208
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:16,967
Take you to Springwood,
it's gonna trigger something...

209
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:18,487
some spark to help you remember

210
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,687
I don't need a spark to remember
that it was a bad place

211
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:22,967
You want a spark? You go

212
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,167
I'll stay here,
sparkless but happy

213
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,247
I'll be right there with you
Don't worry

214
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,007
Kelly, we're gonna take
the van for awhile

215
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,727
I told you not to let me
fall asleep

216
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,367
Was that too much to ask for?

217
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:07,887
Go back

218
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,847
Oh, my God! Pull over!

219
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,007
John, wake up!

220
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:17,847
Shit Great

221
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,287
Funny meeting you here

222
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:22,967
Nice driving

223
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:25,887
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

224
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:27,847
Great plan, asshole

225
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:30,327
-It almost worked, all right?
-I can't believe you people

226
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:33,407
Pulling a stunt like that

227
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,527
Oh, my God

228
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,247
Look, the first thing we have
to do is find a telephone

229
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,007
and you call Kelly
and tell him where you are

230
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:41,287
You understand?

231
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,727
And then we have to figure out
how to get you home

232
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,327
Are you listening?

233
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,527
Don't scream at me!

234
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,207
It was your driving
that almost killed us

235
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,647
Two for a dollar, right here!

236
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:19,807
Get 'em, two!

237
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:21,927
Two for a dollar!

238
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:26,207
First I want you to find
a phone, call Kelly

239
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:27,447
and tell him you're all right

240
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,887
Then I want you
to get in that van

241
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,647
and drive straight back
to the shelter

242
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:31,967
Think you can handle that

243
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,407
or do I have to call
the police?

244
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,927
Get away from here You go away!

245
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,927
"Or do I have to call
the police?"

246
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:42,887
She ain't my mother

247
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,687
We want some peach cobbler
here and

248
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,247
-There are no kids
-What?

249
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:04,567
Town fair

250
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:06,207
and there are no kids

251
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:19,127
-So what's up, Spence?
-This phone's out of order

252
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:20,367
So is this town

253
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,367
You are not kidding

254
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:25,687
Oh, what beautiful,
adorable children!

255
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,407
Would you like to come
and live with us?

256
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:30,607
It's been so long since
we've had children in the house

257
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,487
So long

258
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:34,607
This time,
I swear it'll be different

259
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:36,247
This time, I'll be careful

260
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:38,927
and I'll hide you better,
so that he'll never find you

261
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:41,327
Looky, I got your nose! Looky!

262
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,447
Ethel!

263
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,087
I want my children back!

264
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:48,527
You know they bring him!

265
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:58,447
Now see what you done did?!

266
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,087
Jesus

267
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,327
-We're in Twin Peaks here
-Definitely

268
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:04,447
Have we seen enough?

269
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:05,767
-Yeah
-Good

270
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:10,767
Come on, back in the van

271
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,447
That's a very good idea

272
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:13,807
Now Go!

273
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:14,927
Jeez

274
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:22,727
I hope they make it

275
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,407
Let's see what they can tell us
at the school

276
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,767
-What?
-Somebody rang those bells

277
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:29,607
Lucky us

278
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:48,327
Trace, there's a map back here

279
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:49,887
Did I say I needed a map?

280
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:52,327
I can't get over the way
those people looked at us

281
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:53,967
Yeah, that was weird

282
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:04,487
Shit

283
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,647
Nice going

284
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:10,887
Takes talent to travel
in a complete circle

285
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,487
And you're making me dizzy

286
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,207
Jeez

287
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,527
Do you have to do that?

288
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,607
You're such a high ho,
you know that?

289
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:21,047
I don't play that shit
I need all the senses I've got

290
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,007
Put that fucking thing out

291
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,127
It's hard enough
staying awake

292
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,967
without you lighting up
every ten seconds

293
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,687
-This relaxes me
-I'll relax you

294
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:30,167
I'll just puncture your heart

295
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:31,727
mess up these seats

296
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:32,967
You need to get laid

297
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,687
Would you like the map now?

298
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,487
No, I don't need any map

299
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:40,007
No, of course not

300
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,607
-Why'd you stop?
-Look

301
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,247
Oh, great

302
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:24,767
Give me the map

303
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:28,447
Not a word

304
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,927
Carlos, I asked you for the map!

305
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:58,487
What is this?!

306
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:07,847
I asked you for the map

307
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:09,567
What?

308
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:13,807
Yeah, well,
the map says we're fucked

309
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:17,887
Look, you've had two chances
Now it's my turn

310
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,287
Dickhead

311
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:24,447
Nice

312
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,487
You'll all be expected
to pass

313
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:47,487
both the written
and an oral examination

314
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:49,887
Don't disturb him

315
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,767
You will need to study

316
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:54,967
this

317
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:00,687
Now the dates
Got to get the dates right

318
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:02,127
Got to keep them in order

319
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,207
If you get them out of order,
you'll get very confused

320
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:23,927
You were here

321
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,087
What?

322
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:29,487
Welcome

323
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:32,767
to Freddy 101

324
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:36,207
1493...

325
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,647
Freddy sailed across the sea

326
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,647
These dates, they're all
within a ten-year period

327
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:48,607
What the hell happened here?

328
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,287
Freddy happened here

329
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:53,367
Here was the crucial point

330
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:54,807
Anybody know
what I'm getting at?

331
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,767
Anybody? Hmm?

332
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,367
Come on, people!

333
00:27:58,402 --> 00:27:59,927
We covered this!

334
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,727
This is where
they took away his child

335
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,007
What child?

336
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:06,127
Taken away

337
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,887
put in the town orphanage

338
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:09,127
Freddy had a kid

339
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:17,447
1494...

340
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,087
Freddy came back

341
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:21,567
to look

342
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:22,887
for more

343
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:31,447
There's no way out

344
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:32,767
Not with you driving

345
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:34,612
Yeah, well,
you didn't do much better

346
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,807
No, but at least I did it
in half the time

347
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:41,087
Come on Where are you going?

348
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,807
Away

349
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,287
Look, we're just too fried
to see straight

350
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:45,407
Let's just find Maggie

351
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:49,047
I'm not turning myself over
for any adult supervision

352
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:50,607
This girl's getting some rest

353
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,367
In fact, I think I see my kinda
neighborhood up ahead...

354
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:55,487
empty

355
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:56,927
You know, she's losing it

356
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:58,687
Sad thing is,
I'm starting to like her

357
00:28:58,727 --> 00:28:59,927
That is sad

358
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,247
Come on, Trace Wait up!

359
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,287
This is the one

360
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:22,087
We'll have it all to ourselves

361
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:25,247
-Bet there's no heat
-No plumbing, right?

362
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:26,567
You'll survive

363
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:29,927
Come on

364
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:11,727
Where you going?

365
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,767
Gonna go upstairs
and find a bed Man, I'm tired

366
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,487
I gotta find a bathroom

367
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:20,407
This place makes the shelter
look like the Ritz

368
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:42,047
Great

369
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,047
Well

370
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:49,527
at least it beats the streets,
right, Carlos?

371
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,527
Ohh, this is good

372
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,092
I'm gonna get some sleep

373
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:57,727
and I will get us out of here
in the morning

374
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:11,527
Why do you think that kid
said not to fall asleep?

375
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:13,127
'Cause he's a lame-o freak

376
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:16,287
Miss Maggie's pet psycho

377
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:43,887
Where the hell are you?

378
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:46,167
Why aren't you listening
to me, Carlos?

379
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:04,407
Tracy, where are you?

380
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:05,967
Behind you

381
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,087
Mama?

382
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:17,967
Maybe you don't hear so good

383
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:22,287
Maybe I clean out your ears
for you

384
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:24,407
No, no Mama, please,
I've been a good boy

385
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:25,947
You don't understand

386
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,447
I've been good, Mama!

387
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,447
Don't make me deaf, Mama!
Please! I'm sorry!

388
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:31,567
I'm not

389
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:49,287
Oh, Carlos, lend me your ear

390
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:18,567
Give me my hearing back!

391
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,007
Where is it?

392
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:38,847
Y-you wouldn't do that,
would you, man?

393
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:40,887
No, no, no! Please!

394
00:35:40,927 --> 00:35:42,047
No, man!

395
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:59,847
Nice hearing from you, Carlos

396
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:20,727
I can't find Carlos

397
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:23,127
See what's on this TV?

398
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,527
I'm gonna take the van
I'm gonna look for him

399
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,287
Give me some room!

400
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:40,407
Don't fall asleep, man!

401
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:41,527
Get out!

402
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,447
Spencer, get out, man!

403
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:45,087
Carlos, man

404
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,727
we were just looking for you

405
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:51,567
Don't fall asleep, man!

406
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:53,727
Spencer, you stupid stoner!

407
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:04,247
We shouldn't even be here

408
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,287
We're supposed to be
finding out about you

409
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,612
not some dead killer's kid

410
00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:13,287
We might be talking
about the same thing

411
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:15,887
The whole town's obsessing
on this Krueger character

412
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,327
Don't you start

413
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:21,567
But why else
would they be afraid of me?

414
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:24,287
Why else am I still alive
when everybody else is dead?

415
00:38:24,327 --> 00:38:26,927
Skip, skip, skip to my loo

416
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:29,367
Skip to my loo, my darling

417
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:40,207
Martha, no running

418
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:41,527
Everyone hold hands

419
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:45,807
Oh, you've come back

420
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:47,207
How nice

421
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:49,327
Do you remember me?

422
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:50,927
Well, of course I do, my boy

423
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,727
I remember
every one of my children

424
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:54,967
Especially you

425
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,527
What a pretty little girl
you were

426
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,047
And I remember you

427
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,967
and you

428
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,287
Do you remember
the Krueger child?

429
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:04,727
Of course

430
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:06,567
Who was it?

431
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:09,007
We're not permitted to disclose
a child's real identity

432
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,927
Oh, Melissa Melissa

433
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:13,007
You must let Bobby
have the ball

434
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:15,927
Come here That's all right

435
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,207
We share

436
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:20,087
I wonder who has a little
bare footie around here?

437
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:21,447
"K Krueger"

438
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:23,487
Could mean anything
from Kevin to Kyle

439
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,887
All it really means is there was
a child here by that name

440
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:29,567
No It's me

441
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:34,367
I'm his kid

442
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:36,247
That's why he's kept me alive

443
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:39,327
He's trying to play
some sick game with me

444
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,727
He is dead, all right?

445
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:43,447
He's dead,
and you're not his kid

446
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,047
How do you know?

447
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:47,647
She remembered me

448
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:49,087
She remembered me, too

449
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:51,327
and fifty other
imaginary friends

450
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:52,767
Let's get out of here

451
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,687
Let's draw a picture

452
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,087
We can draw pictures all day

453
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,207
There you go

454
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:00,727
Clippety-clop, clippety-clop
Isn't that fun?

455
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:08,687
I can't believe I found you

456
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:10,127
What are you still doing here?

457
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,892
I can't find Carlos

458
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:14,067
and Spencer's wasted
at this old house

459
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:16,207
We gotta get to them
before Freddy does

460
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,607
-Who's Freddy?
-I'll tell you on the way

461
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:18,687
Come on!

462
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:21,647
God damn it!

463
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:33,847
All right Once again

464
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,207
This is your brain

465
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:41,087
This is your brain

466
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:43,047
on drugs

467
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:46,327
Questions?

468
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,447
Yeah! What are you on?

469
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:53,607
Looks like a frying pan
and some eggs to me

470
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:57,487
Hey, Spence

471
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,287
Let's trip out

472
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:08,527
Cool

473
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:45,567
Now he's gone!

474
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:48,007
He must've fallen asleep

475
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,927
You two look here and upstairs
I'm gonna look downstairs

476
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,367
They're not here anymore

477
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:54,287
Just humor me,
will you, please, and look?

478
00:41:58,007 --> 00:41:59,407
Where am I?

479
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:02,487
Jump, boy

480
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:11,727
-Dad?
-Be like me

481
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:16,207
Father knows best

482
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:17,807
Oh! Oh, stop!

483
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,487
I'm not like you!

484
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,007
I don't wanna be like you!

485
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,967
Be like me

486
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,567
Now I'm playin' with power!

487
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:38,447
All right

488
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:41,567
Super Spencer!

489
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,127
Great graphics

490
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,447
Whoa I'm here

491
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:16,567
I found Spencer!

492
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:23,567
OK, hold him down

493
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,287
Oh, shit

494
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:29,327
Hold on Hold on to him

495
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:32,047
-What's happening to him?
-He's stuck in a nightmare

496
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:33,207
And it's kicking
the shit out of him!

497
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,047
-Wake him up
-He's too wasted

498
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:38,487
-Spencer! Jesus
-It's Freddy

499
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:41,847
We've got to get him out

500
00:43:41,887 --> 00:43:43,407
I'll go into his dream

501
00:43:43,447 --> 00:43:45,807
I'll try and bring him out
before he gets killed

502
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:46,967
That's crazy

503
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:51,327
What do you call that, rational?

504
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,767
Right, left
Right, left, right, left Pow!

505
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:26,967
He's getting trashed

506
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,087
I have to go in

507
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:29,367
What about Freddy?

508
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,247
Freddy won't hurt me

509
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:32,767
I'm family

510
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:34,487
OK, so how are you gonna go in?

511
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:36,087
Well

512
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:38,607
you're gonna have to lay me out

513
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:40,607
What? What is th...

514
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:42,292
-Just fucking lay me out!
-Wait a second!

515
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:45,927
-Doc told me a different way
-No time to talk! Just do it!

516
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:56,687
Jesus Christ

517
00:45:03,127 --> 00:45:05,407
I told you I knew an easier way

518
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:08,527
Concentration meditation
That's what Doc always says

519
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:11,447
This place is incredible

520
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,567
Pow! Bam! Splat!

521
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:17,047
Is that him?

522
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:19,967
Jump, boy

523
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:22,967
Ow! Stop!

524
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:24,887
Oh, shit! Spencer!

525
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,287
Come on, John! Let go of me!

526
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:35,147
Get out of here! Now, Tracy!

527
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:37,367
Hey, You forgot the power glove

528
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:41,087
Pow!

529
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:43,567
Boing, boing

530
00:45:56,247 --> 00:45:58,007
Be like me Be like me

531
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:14,767
What do you know?

532
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:16,967
I beat my high score

533
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:40,807
Great to be back in business

534
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:42,607
thanks to you

535
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:52,607
Daddy's waiting for you,
little girl

536
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:53,967
Shut the fuck up, man!

537
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:08,407
Spencer's gone
I couldn't stop it

538
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:10,607
John's still in there

539
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:11,887
I couldn't wake him up

540
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,327
Come on! Snap out of it!
What are we gonna do?

541
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:16,767
We're gonna pick him up
and get the hell out of here!

542
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:21,367
Not again

543
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:23,287
He's not gonna get me again

544
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,527
Nothing is gonna
make me get off this bed

545
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:31,167
Damn it!

546
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:37,087
I hate this house

547
00:49:22,487 --> 00:49:23,887
Up here!

548
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,727
I know why you let me go

549
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:46,247
Do you think I'm your daddy?

550
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:51,447
Wrong!

551
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:57,647
But you let me live

552
00:49:57,687 --> 00:50:01,607
Only long enough for you
to bring me back my daughter

553
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:02,767
Your daughter?

554
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:07,047
And now

555
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:11,927
she's gonna take me
to a whole new playground

556
00:50:17,087 --> 00:50:20,367
Grounded!

557
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:42,847
Oh, my God, Maggie!
What's going on?

558
00:50:43,847 --> 00:50:45,807
Come on, Maggie Let's go!

559
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:48,607
Come...

560
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:50,367
Let's get out of here!

561
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:51,807
Let's get the hell out of here!

562
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:54,287
It... it's not a boy

563
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,367
It's

564
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:01,047
Come on!
We gotta get out of here!

565
00:51:01,087 --> 00:51:03,167
Now! Come on!

566
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:07,287
Let's go!

567
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:19,727
You forgot
where you came from, kid

568
00:51:20,687 --> 00:51:23,927
but I know where you're going

569
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,607
It's traveling time!

570
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:45,967
What's wrong?
Maggie, get in the van!

571
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:47,087
Come on!

572
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:51,047
We gotta get the hell
out of here!

573
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:52,327
Oh, God

574
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:53,647
Let's go!

575
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:16,487
Whatever happened

576
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:18,327
it wasn't your fault

577
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,887
Carlos, Tracy, and Spencer

578
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:34,247
stowed away in the back
of the shelter van

579
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:36,647
They were trying to escape
Can you believe it?

580
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:39,527
So I took them to the phone
They were supposed to call you

581
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,447
John Doe and I were gonna
check out the school

582
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:43,087
But Tracy got separated

583
00:52:43,122 --> 00:52:44,687
And then they ran away

584
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:47,127
What the hell
are you talking about?

585
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:50,007
I'm talking about Carlos
and Spencer and the John Doe!

586
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,967
Kelly, they just disappeared!

587
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:53,527
Been handling
too many cases, Maggie

588
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:54,967
Those kids were never here

589
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,327
I would've remembered
any new arrivals

590
00:52:58,367 --> 00:53:00,367
Kelly, I'm talking about
forty-eight hours ago

591
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:01,487
I brought you a John Doe

592
00:53:01,527 --> 00:53:02,767
Don't tell me
you don't remember that!

593
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:04,487
You the one who's handling
too many cases!

594
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:05,647
Get some rest, Maggie

595
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:10,527
And then

596
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:13,367
we got back and

597
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:16,047
no one remembers John or Carlos

598
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,967
It's like they never existed

599
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:21,687
I've been hearing strange shit

600
00:53:21,727 --> 00:53:25,087
Like some of the kids
are dreaming about Carlos

601
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:27,447
And they don't even
remember him

602
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:33,047
I remember him

603
00:53:33,087 --> 00:53:34,647
Why?

604
00:53:34,687 --> 00:53:36,567
Because I can control my dreams

605
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:39,407
I'm not fooled
by this thing you saw

606
00:53:40,247 --> 00:53:41,327
Whatever he is

607
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:44,327
he's fucking with the line
between dreams and reality

608
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:46,847
He didn't just kill Carlos
and the others

609
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:49,087
He erased them

610
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:03,927
It's not a boy

611
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:32,647
Mother!

612
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:56,887
Shit

613
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:02,807
You're getting ready
to kill somebody

614
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:04,407
Defend myself

615
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:08,847
It's your mind he'll go for

616
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:12,367
Your fear

617
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:16,407
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it

618
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:22,567
Maggie, what are you doing?

619
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:25,167
Who are they?

620
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:27,407
Let me have that

621
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,727
-I have to know
-I don't know

622
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:31,927
I don't know who they were
They wouldn't tell me

623
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:35,047
They have rules
about no contact

624
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:38,647
Oh, there's been contact

625
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:37,607
Find me

626
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:38,767
Find Daddy

627
00:56:39,807 --> 00:56:40,847
You're it

628
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,447
Come to Daddy

629
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:48,687
I won't tell

630
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:49,807
Oh, God

631
00:56:58,327 --> 00:57:00,007
Fred, please

632
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:01,487
I won't tell

633
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:06,327
We need to talk, Loretta

634
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:12,567
Go inside, honey

635
00:57:14,087 --> 00:57:16,007
I won't tell

636
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:18,087
I told you never

637
00:57:18,127 --> 00:57:20,327
never to go in there

638
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,167
I told you that! I told you

639
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,847
Catherine

640
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:40,407
You were such a little artist

641
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:41,847
No, it can't be

642
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:45,007
I know who I am

643
00:58:51,447 --> 00:58:54,007
You're my blood

644
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:56,727
Only you could have
brought me out

645
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,447
in your mind

646
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:00,567
But you can't be my father

647
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:02,727
They took you away from me

648
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:05,967
but I made 'em pay!

649
00:59:06,007 --> 00:59:10,207
I took all their children
away from them

650
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:11,407
and now

651
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,047
that's over

652
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,207
Come on

653
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:26,607
The shelter

654
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:32,167
Time to start all over again

655
00:59:32,207 --> 00:59:33,807
But this isn't Springwood!

656
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:42,527
Every town

657
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:44,647
has an Elm Street

658
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:21,367
Tracy girl

659
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,607
Daddy's home

660
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,087
Daddy youre dead

661
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:33,367
I'm home, darling

662
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:44,887
Come say hello

663
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:48,087
I don't want to, Daddy

664
01:00:57,847 --> 01:01:00,727
Come on, give Daddy some honey

665
01:01:05,847 --> 01:01:07,607
No one has to know

666
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:16,767
You're not my daddy

667
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:21,207
Come on, Tracy

668
01:01:28,407 --> 01:01:31,087
Here! Do you love me now?

669
01:01:36,087 --> 01:01:37,332
He's dead!

670
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:39,087
My daddy's dead

671
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:48,047
No honey for Daddy?

672
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:57,287
What's with kids today, huh?

673
01:01:57,327 --> 01:01:59,127
No respect

674
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,287
You can't scare me anymore

675
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:03,847
Oh, you better speak up

676
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:06,367
Must be my deaf ear

677
01:02:14,247 --> 01:02:17,007
Kung fu this, bitch

678
01:02:22,847 --> 01:02:25,687
This is my dream,
and I do what I want

679
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:27,687
Might be your dream

680
01:02:27,727 --> 01:02:30,367
but it's my rules!

681
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:53,247
Doc... I need to talk to Doc!

682
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:55,887
Come on!

683
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:36,207
Doc? Doc, is that you?

684
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:37,807
Yeah, Tracy Where are you?

685
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,407
I'm over here
in one of the lockers

686
01:03:39,447 --> 01:03:40,687
You gotta get me out!

687
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:47,207
Where the hell are you?

688
01:03:47,247 --> 01:03:48,447
Right here

689
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:53,172
You taught her a lot

690
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:57,167
but there's so much more
to learn

691
01:03:57,207 --> 01:03:59,447
How about this, Doc?

692
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:31,487
Sticks and stones
may break my bones

693
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:35,887
but nothing will ever kill me

694
01:04:36,687 --> 01:04:39,807
Well, let's see now

695
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:42,767
First they tried burning me

696
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:48,687
Then they tried burying me

697
01:04:54,647 --> 01:04:58,327
But this... this is my favorite

698
01:05:00,207 --> 01:05:03,367
They even tried holy water

699
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:11,767
But I just keep on tickin'

700
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:15,727
because they promised me that

701
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:16,847
They?

702
01:05:16,887 --> 01:05:18,687
The dream people

703
01:05:18,727 --> 01:05:20,927
The ones that gave me this job

704
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:23,807
In dreams

705
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:29,127
I am forever!

706
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,807
Too bad you're not

707
01:05:50,087 --> 01:05:51,207
Thank God

708
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,767
I think I've got a way
to get him

709
01:05:56,447 --> 01:05:57,927
So what's the plan, Doc?

710
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:01,247
Thanks

711
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:02,607
You can't get him
in the dream

712
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:06,407
but if this can come out,
he can come out

713
01:06:06,447 --> 01:06:08,967
And if he can come out,
he can bleed

714
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,647
-And die
-Right

715
01:06:10,687 --> 01:06:12,167
How will you know
when I got him?

716
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:13,807
I'm gonna find you with this

717
01:06:13,847 --> 01:06:15,252
and then I'm bringing you out

718
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:17,487
You've got to be holding him
to carry him out

719
01:06:17,527 --> 01:06:18,967
I know

720
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,727
He's gonna try and trick you
just like Tracy

721
01:06:21,407 --> 01:06:23,447
He'll try to use your eyes
to fool you

722
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:25,047
You'll use these

723
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:26,327
Get the hell outta here

724
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:27,807
You want to live?

725
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:29,887
These mean nothing here

726
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:32,087
but in a dream,
they can be anything you want

727
01:06:32,127 --> 01:06:35,047
He got inside your head
You get inside of his

728
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:37,447
That's my job, isn't it?

729
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:40,367
Be careful He's good at
finding out what hurts the most

730
01:06:40,407 --> 01:06:41,487
Exactly

731
01:06:41,527 --> 01:06:44,127
That's why you gotta take me
with you

732
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,447
I can't

733
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:48,527
It's gotta be me and him

734
01:06:51,127 --> 01:06:52,367
All right, Doc

735
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:54,527
Put me in

736
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:00,527
Strap her in

737
01:07:03,727 --> 01:07:04,967
Take a deep breath

738
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:07,767
Good

739
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:09,687
Ten

740
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:11,807
nine

741
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:13,887
eight

742
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:15,167
seven

743
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:16,767
six

744
01:07:16,807 --> 01:07:18,087
five

745
01:07:18,127 --> 01:07:19,727
four

746
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:20,967
three

747
01:07:21,007 --> 01:07:22,127
two

748
01:07:23,127 --> 01:07:24,207
one

749
01:08:20,687 --> 01:08:23,047
Get inside his brain

750
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:18,767
I'm in his memories

751
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:31,287
Son of a hundred maniacs

752
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,767
You ready for it, boy?

753
01:11:11,087 --> 01:11:14,567
You been a waste
since the day I took you in

754
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:17,207
Now it's time
to take your medicine

755
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:24,167
Thank you, sir

756
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:27,527
May I have another?

757
01:11:32,487 --> 01:11:34,367
You want to know
the secret of pain?

758
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:37,687
If you just stop feeling it

759
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,887
you can start using it

760
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,287
Child killer!

761
01:12:05,647 --> 01:12:07,447
We know what you want

762
01:12:07,487 --> 01:12:09,127
I want it all!

763
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:10,347
Of course you do

764
01:12:10,382 --> 01:12:11,527
Then open up

765
01:12:11,567 --> 01:12:14,767
And you shall be forever!

766
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:42,607
Mommy!

767
01:12:52,207 --> 01:12:54,127
Don't worry, baby

768
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,487
Mommy just had
to take her medicine

769
01:12:56,527 --> 01:12:58,687
for snooping
in Daddy's special work

770
01:13:01,247 --> 01:13:03,887
But you won't tell, will you?

771
01:13:04,687 --> 01:13:06,087
I won't tell

772
01:13:16,847 --> 01:13:19,367
But you did tell, didn't you?

773
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:24,447
And now it's time
to take your medicine

774
01:13:29,647 --> 01:13:30,927
You killed my mother!

775
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:37,687
She's got him!

776
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:40,007
Let's get her out of there

777
01:14:01,927 --> 01:14:03,087
I've got you!

778
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:11,487
I had him!

779
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:13,807
Where the hell is he?

780
01:14:16,367 --> 01:14:17,567
Maybe the trip killed him

781
01:14:17,607 --> 01:14:19,687
No because
I'm still seeing things

782
01:14:20,327 --> 01:14:22,247
the way I did in my dream

783
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:23,047
It's not over Let's go

784
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:35,367
The cops were supposed
to pick this stuff up

785
01:14:35,407 --> 01:14:36,487
I'm glad they didn't

786
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:38,287
We'll have to hit him
with everything we've got

787
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:44,567
Check out this knife

788
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,327
-Hey, put that away
-That's too small

789
01:14:52,207 --> 01:14:53,767
Guess so

790
01:14:53,807 --> 01:14:54,927
You sure that's big enough?

791
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:58,087
Still believe
he's gonna show up, huh?

792
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:00,367
Come on, Tracy Over here

793
01:15:02,887 --> 01:15:04,287
I can feel it

794
01:15:34,887 --> 01:15:36,447
You're real here

795
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:38,207
It wasn't my fault

796
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:40,007
It wasn't

797
01:15:41,007 --> 01:15:44,207
You saw what they did to me
when I was a kid

798
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:45,487
You saw

799
01:15:47,207 --> 01:15:48,727
I loved you

800
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:52,007
And your mother

801
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,727
I tried so hard to be good

802
01:15:56,127 --> 01:15:57,407
I know, Daddy

803
01:15:58,327 --> 01:16:00,167
But when they took you
from me

804
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:01,927
it wasn't right

805
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:04,367
Oh, I knew you'd believe me

806
01:16:05,927 --> 01:16:07,047
Come to Daddy

807
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:22,887
Over here!

808
01:16:23,807 --> 01:16:25,247
I'm OK

809
01:16:25,967 --> 01:16:27,207
Maggie, watch out!

810
01:16:33,487 --> 01:16:35,327
-Where's the key?
-I don't know!

811
01:16:36,527 --> 01:16:37,687
The lock's jammed!

812
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:39,607
I didn't need a glove

813
01:16:39,647 --> 01:16:41,607
to kill your bitch
of a mother

814
01:16:41,647 --> 01:16:45,167
and I don't need one now!

815
01:16:53,327 --> 01:16:55,127
Come on

816
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,447
Let go

817
01:17:03,087 --> 01:17:04,487
I'll show you how

818
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:12,567
Like you showed my mother?

819
01:17:12,607 --> 01:17:13,767
And Carlos?

820
01:17:15,567 --> 01:17:16,687
And Spencer?

821
01:17:18,287 --> 01:17:20,527
Give Daddy the glove back,
princess

822
01:17:20,562 --> 01:17:21,647
Never!

823
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:24,807
Give it to me!

824
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:29,127
Gimme the glove!

825
01:17:32,487 --> 01:17:34,447
In your dreams!

826
01:17:50,407 --> 01:17:53,887
Oh, Daddy, I remember when we
used to hold hands together

827
01:17:53,927 --> 01:17:55,767
when I was a kid

828
01:17:55,807 --> 01:17:56,927
I didn't like it then, either!

829
01:17:59,927 --> 01:18:02,447
I forgot how much it hurts
to be human

830
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,487
Go ahead

831
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,607
put it on

832
01:19:15,727 --> 01:19:17,207
It's in your blood

833
01:19:33,007 --> 01:19:34,527
That's it Put it on

834
01:19:37,287 --> 01:19:39,127
Feels good, doesn't it?

835
01:19:40,967 --> 01:19:43,527
Yeah come on

836
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:47,687
Let your daddy show you
how to use it

837
01:20:12,367 --> 01:20:14,247
Happy Father's Day

838
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:15,567
Come on, Doc!

839
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:20,607
Come on! Let's hurry!

840
01:20:20,647 --> 01:20:21,887
Let's get outta here! Come on!

841
01:20:21,927 --> 01:20:24,847
Oh kids

842
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:38,607
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm OK

843
01:20:52,367 --> 01:20:53,727
Freddy's dead
