anywhere else.

Cool.

00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,208
Well, I could give
you a catheter.

I'm just glad the

That fire really did a

132
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,899
And I can't afford to be
driving her into the city

Okay.

I'm not gonna miss this.

00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,257
You gonna be able to
handle him, Richard?

146

Your friend here's
had quite a trauma.

147
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,562
Well, not that we have any
ID bracelets left, but for

148
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,996
the record his name is James.

149
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,264
How bad is he?

150
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,966
Well, he's not been
very cooperative.

151
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,935
The sedative will help us
determine exactly what his

152

condition is, but our
resources are limited here.

153

Everything's been
packed up for the move.

Kim, I know getting
transferred over here

158
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,659
wasn't your first choice,
but you're supposed to be

159
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,328
boxing up files.

160
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,197
No, there are things
called computers now.

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,667
I can do my own laundry.

00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,336
Well! Look at you.

173
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,074
Brought you uh, coffee.

Nice.

00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,411
I was looking for that.

you get any ideas.

Right.

Uh... I'm sorry.

00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,798
Am I interrupting something?

183
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,233
- No, no.
- No. No, no, no.

184
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,436
I'm just gonna go make sure Bev
hasn't murdered my intern.

185
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,204
I'll see you.

He's not badly hurt, but

You should be

Yeah, okay.

As you know Daniel,
there's nothing worse than

195
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,698
losing a child.

196
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,102
When we lost Sarah,
I was a mess.

It took a long time to
come back from that.

No, no, no, no.

Look, it's not

This trooper's probably
gonna wanna talk to you.

00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,732
We should see about

No, no, no.

00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,201

00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,994
So what happened?

292
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,562
They told me you found
the two of them together.

00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,497
Uh, yeah.

294
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,202
He was dead when I arrived
and she came at me with a

295
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,104

296
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,539
How did you get here so fast?

Your guy in the other room.

298
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,294
What about him?

299
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,212
We got a major bloodbath about
twenty miles north of here.

300
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,081
Looks like he tore the
place up like a butcher shop.

301
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,483
Uh, yeah.

302
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,185
We looked him over and
most of the blood on his

303
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,720
body was not his.

304
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,356
Well he has a long list
of drug related priors.

305
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,759
So I think he gave
your nurse something.

306
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,528
I've got him cuffed to the
bed for the time being.

00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,674
You know, Carter, your
dad was a stand up cop.

00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:28,212
I wonder what he'd think
if he saw this shit show.

00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,738
I've stopped the
bleeding for now.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey.

382
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,350
Okay, maybe don't try
to get up just yet.

383
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,519
What happened out there?

384
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,856
Just give him a second.

385
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,726
It looks like they've got
the place surrounded.

386
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,127
They're not trying to get in.

387
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,028
Who are they?

388
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,496
I don't know.

389
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,899
I wasn't able to
get through. You?

390
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,501
No.

391
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,503
We should move
everyone back inside.

392
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:55,540
Who knows what they want.

393
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,576
No, maybe we can barricade
the doors or uh, you know,

394
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,678
get out some other way.

00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:00,564
Okay, listen to me.

563
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,800
We didn't do anything to you.

564
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,202
I have a girl back there
who's about to give birth

565
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,104
and I need to get
her some place safe.

566
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,372
Are you fucking kidding?

567
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,107
Have you had a
look outside lady?

568
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,009
There's nowhere to go.

569
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,577
You can hear those
horns for miles.

570
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,213
There is something
calling them all here.

571
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,981
Okay, what is that?
Who are they? What just...

572
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,817
How the fuck should I know?

573
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,452
- Go ask them!
- It's okay, it's okay.

574
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,989
All I know is that that
thing woke up once already

575
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,592
and I don't wanna be around
when it happens again.

576
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,398
[door opens]

577
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:49,513
Oh, there's a problem.

578
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,848
Maggie.

579
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,884
I didn't know what to do.

580
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,385
Okay.

581
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,887
Hey, sweetie.

582
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:02,059
Are we leaving?

583
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,394
No, not just yet.

584
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,173
Would you put that out?

585
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,908
Al.

586
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,310
- What, this?
- Yeah.

587
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,979
Put it out.

588
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:23,981
Okay.

589
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,982
I think we all should
just remain calm.

590
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,284
Bullshit.

591
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,419
We should've been
out of here already.

592
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,088
You people need to wake up.

593
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,357
Or what?

594
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,560
You think you'll stand a
chance if there's another

595
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,295
one of those things out there?

596
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,197
- Okay.
- Will you, huh?

597
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,098
- Okay, okay.
- Who's gonna stop it? Grandpa?

598
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,034
The teenage fucking slut.

599
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,435
Oh! Come on now!

600
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,136
Whoa, whoa!

601
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,337
Come on.

602
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,505
We're gonna die.

603
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,740
[crying]

604
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,974
No, we're not gonna die.

605
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,075
You're gonna die.

606
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,175
I'm not gonna let that happen.

607
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,311
Okay.

608
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,950
Okay.

609
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,621
I don't know what the fuck
you think you're trying to do.

610
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,923
Okay? Just calm down.

611
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,224
He's upsetting her
and that is not good.

612
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,692
- I need you to stay calm.
- Okay.

613
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,161
Can you please tell me
what is going on over there?

614
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,330
Her contractions are still
spread out, but she's

615
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,565
having abdominal pain
which is a bad sign.

616
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,401
Okay, I don't know
what that means.

617
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,969
What does that mean?

618
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,536
That means that
we can't move her.

619
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,507
It can make things much worse.

620
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,609
Also the last thing I need
is to be performing a

621
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,278
cesarean in the middle of
this, but I have nothing

622
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,281
here to help her and if I don't
do anything the baby could die.

623
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,383
I need to go to the
med supply room.

624
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,218
So I'll go.

625
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,689
Alone? No, no, no,
that's out of the question.

626
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,457
I'm not asking.

627
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,559
We need to handle this now.

628
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,427
Alright.

629
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,979
Okay, look.

630
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,530
We have no idea
what is out there.

631
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,465
We have no way of
defending ourselves.

632
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,634
Plus these two fucking
psychos now think that

633
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,735
we're hostage.

634
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,371
I'm doing this.

635
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,040
You're not. You're not.
You're not even...

636
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,443
If this is because of the
baby then you need to get

637
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:00,677
a fucking mental check.

638
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,314
Jesus Christ, this
is not about us.

639
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,684
That girl, if she
suffers an abruption

640
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,353
then her baby will die.

641
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:12,222
If I try to take it out
of her, and I don't use

642
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,092
anesthetic then she
could die of shock.

643
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,061
Daniel, look at me.

644
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,533
Okay, fine.
Fuck it, fuck it.

645
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,569
Uh...

646
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,504
Okay, but you're
not going alone.

647
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,140
You have to promise and wait
for me, okay? You promise?

648
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,442
- Okay.
- Alright.

649
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,284
May I approach?

650
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,557
The girl's not doing well
and neither is the baby so

651
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:53,030
we need to go and get
some things to help her.

652
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,265
What do you want from us?

653
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,335
Well I have a shotgun
in my cruiser.

654
00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,403
I have ammunition.

655
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,171
[laughs]

656
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,440
We just fought our way in here.

657
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:06,176
I'm not gonna just
stroll back out again.

658
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:11,081
Okay, but as far as I can
tell we're all the same boat.

659
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,817
You've got a rifle without
any bullets and a couple

660
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,386
of fucking fire axes.

661
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,438
I just...

662
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,489
it's close and we
can do it fast.

663
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,526
[sighs]

664
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:28,598
Alright, but we're not
risking our lives for you.

665
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,269
We get that gun, it's ours.

666
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,171
Oh, absolutely.

667
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:37,107
Abso-fucking-lutley.

668
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,176
Okay.

669
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,825
I thought you said it was close.

670
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:56,693
What the hell?

671
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,696
It's still out there.

672
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:03,433
Yeah, but what are
they waiting for?

673
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,435
Let's just make this quick.

674
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,506
Shotgun's locked
on the front seat.

675
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:13,276
I gotta release it, but...

676
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,712
you get all the ammo
out of the trunk.

677
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,686
Don't get any bright ideas.

678
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,456
Hey, hold up.

679
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,325
God damnit.

680
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,429
What if they don't come back?

681
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:35,198
Daniel knows what he's doing.

682
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,568
It's alright.

683
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,904
I shouldn't even
be here right now.

684
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,174
I should be at Lakeland
turning over patients.

685
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,809
Fuck this place.

686
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,478
Well, you're stuck with us
now, Kim, so deal with it.

687
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,814
[soft sobs]

688
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,883
How you doing, honey?

689
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,718
It hurts.

690
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:59,422
What's gonna happen to my baby?

691
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,629
Listen to me.

692
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,832
You and your baby are
going to be fine.

693
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,800
You have my word.

694
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,412
[suspenseful music]

695
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,649
[♪♪]

696
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:48,772
Shit.

697
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,379
Fuck.

698
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,815
What the fuck are
you doing in there?

699
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,651
[suspenseful music]

700
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,821
[♪♪]

701
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,487
[screeching sound]

702
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,028
What the fuck's
going on in there?

703
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,663
Ah, shit.

704
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:47,864
K, time's up.

705
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,766
That's our cue to leave.

706
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,535
[eerie music]

707
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,572
[♪♪]

708
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,743
Come on, god damnit!

709
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,911
Fuck's sake!

710
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:07,050
Fucking hurry up!

711
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,486
Look out!

712
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,021
[gunshot]

713
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,393
I'm keeping the fucking gun.

714
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,872
This place isn't gonna
keep anything out.

715
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,745
Oh my god.

716
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:36,747
Hey.

717
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,783
Fuck.

718
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,084
What happened?

719
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,852
Here, here.

720
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,888
Where's Allie?

721
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,923
Well she went to get some
medicine for Maggie.

722
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,425
Where?

723
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,359
The med room.

724
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,461
Jesus Christ.

725
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,663
She said there wasn't
anything to worry about inside.

726
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,032
Are you guys in the
same fucking building?

727
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,769
Would you please wait
here, look after them?

728
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,604
Excuse me, sir, would
you mind following me?

729
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,906
Thank you.

730
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,377
That kid will be fine.

731
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,346
He's been through a lot worse.

732
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,814
Those people killed his family.

733
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,016
I barely got him
out of there alive.

734
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,685
Yeah, what about
you, man of mystery?

735
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,554
Mind your own business.

736
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:20,123
And by the way, pretty
stupid to go running off

737
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,958
by herself.

738
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,792
Okay, I'm pretty certain
you can beat the shit out

739
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,729
of me, but I consider it
my special privilege to

740
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,797
hate my wife right now so
if you could kindly shut

741
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,766
the fuck up.

742
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,722
This is Mitchell's gun.

743
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,705
Look.

744
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,766
What?

00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:41,838

747
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,549
Hello, Daniel.

748
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,688
Who is this?

749
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,057
You saw...

750
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,658
something.

751
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,560
I felt it when you woke up.

752
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,598
But what was it?

753
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,604
I can show you
more if you'd like.

754
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,176
Hi, Richard.

755
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,813
I'm sure it's hard
for you to understand.

756
00:41:56,815 --> 00:42:04,020
Beverly found it difficult
as well, but I assure you

757
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,823
my intentions are altruistic.

758
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:17,567
Please tell me what you've done.

759
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:21,971
Richard.

760
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,908
Richard, tell me.

761
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:28,211
Tell me!

762
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,980
You're trying so hard to
follow in your father's

763
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,949
footsteps, Daniel.

764
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,622
Do you really wanna follow
him where he's gone?

765
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:45,094
I understand how desperate
loss can make you.

766
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,298
The night you brought
Allison to me, the life

767
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,569
inside her desperately
clawing to get out.

768
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:58,207
Losing my daughter changed
me, but I'm doing what I

769
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,276
have to to make it right.

770
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:04,013
You'll understand soon enough.

771
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,750
Just please, can you please
tell me where Allison is?

772
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,085
Just...

773
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:12,622
You tell me, god damnit.

774
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,757
You tell me where she is.

775
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,993
Don't worry, Daniel.

776
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,796
I'm gonna help her.

777
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,965
I'm gonna help all of you.

This is crazy! I don't
know what I'm doing.

781
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,759
You can't just leave us.

782
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,428
Kim, Kim, Kim.
We don't have a choice.

783
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,096
Allison's the only one who
knows how to look after Maggie.

784
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,230
Please, look.

785
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,632
Just...

786
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:56,899
these still seem to work inside.

787
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,267
No.

788
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,069
We'll keep in
touch just in case.

789
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,071
We're not gonna be gone
long, we're not going far.

790
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,873
- Look.
- It hurts.

791
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,642
It hurts so bad.

792
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:08,311
I don't know what
half this stuff is!

793
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,879
Please, please don't...

794
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,058
Listen to me.

795
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,236
Listen to me, please.

796
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:13,414
We're just gonna down
there, I'm gonna bring

797
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,753
back Allison, and I need you to
hold out until then, alright?

798
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,955
What if something happens? What
if those people get in here?

799
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:20,857
What are we supposed to do?

800
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,092
Those people are not
trying to get in here.

801
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:26,696
Those people are trying to
keep us from getting out.

802
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:29,432
Okay, that's the
best that I can do.

803
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,300
I hope you know how to use it.

804
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:35,004
And uh...

805
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,273
that's there just in case.

806
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,076
You better know
what you're doing.

[suspenseful music]

808
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,698
Okay, let's go.

809
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:48,316
You think were just gonna go
down there and that'll be that?

810
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:53,122
If you have something to say
than say it, you smug fuck.

811
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,392
Do you know what's down there?

812
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,960
Nope.

813
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,834
But I know someone who might.

814
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:08,971
Hey.

815
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,740
Hey, meth boy.

816
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:11,774
Oh shit.

Oh, good, you remember us.

818
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:14,711
It's not my fault, okay?

819
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:15,445
You gotta believe me.

820
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:16,947
I didn't fucking do anything.

821
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,448
- Just save it. Save it!
- Please help me!

822

- These guys are gonna kill me!
- Hey!

823
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,119
You're gonna wanna pay
attention to my questions.

Please.
No, wait, wait, wait!

Oh god, please don't!

- Alright, pick a finger.
- Don't do this.

827
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,326
No, no, you didn't
ask me anything yet!

828
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,462
I wanna make sure
you know I'm serious.

829
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:34,030
I believe you, okay?

830
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,597
- I fucking believe you.
- Okay, okay, hey!

831
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:37,164
Do you know anything that
will help keep us safe?

832
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,002
Anything at all.

833
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,837
Anything that will
help us survive.

It's the fucking doctor.

835
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,306
It's that fucking doctor.

836
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,341
Okay, fine, we
know that already.

837
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,176
We don't have time for this.

838
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:47,977
Alright, you know what?

839
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:48,862
Make it clean.

840
00:45:48,863 --> 00:45:49,746
No, no, please.
It is him.

841
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,064
It's him and I killed him.

00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:52,381
I swear to god I did
you a fucking favor.

843
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,449
Yeah, well he's
not dead anymore.

00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,151
How is that possible?

845
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,153
What?

846
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,221
Oh god.

00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:00,389
Oh, no, no!

Stop!

00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,265
Listen to me.

853
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,901
How is he alive?
What is he?

854
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,903
I don't fucking know.

855
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,071
Okay, take his hand off.

856
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,873
No, no, please, please!

857
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:17,974
I don't know, I'm serious.

858
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,041
I met a girl on the road.

859
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,060
Fucking please, please, please.

860
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,078
I met a girl on the road
and she told me she could

861
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,181
help me score crystal so
I followed her to this

862
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,232
fucking pill house.

863
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:27,282
Except it wasn't a pill house.

864
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,384
What was it?

865
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,520
What was it?

866
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:33,923
It was an old farm house
in the middle of nowhere.

867
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:36,058
All of these fucking junkies.

868

It was a mess.

It looked like they'd been
killing people for a while.

870
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,964
He gave us drugs.

871
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,499
He watched us have sex.

872
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,951
And he called the
place a church.

873
00:46:44,952 --> 00:46:46,402
Okay, what you're telling
me that Richard was some

874
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,871
kind of sex fiend,
religious thing?

875

My dad knew him for
years, we all did.

That's bullshit.

877
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,975
They were dressed
just like this.

878
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:56,145
There's a bunch of people
dressed like this, okay?

879
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,848
And they did killings
and sacrifices

880
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,017
and they made us watch.

881
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,452
You're talking devil worshiping?

882
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,954
No.

00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,323
No, I don't believe
in the devil.

884

Okay, but I believe in this.

885

887
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:13,496
Thank you.

888
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,897
You're coming with us.

889
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,232
There's no reason to thank us.

890
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,266
What?

891
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,785

- Are you nuts?

No, you've seen he can do.

896
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,374
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

897
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,242
Fuck this place.

898
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:27,343
Yeah? Have a look.

899
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,178
Go on.

No, this is suicide.

No, you're as crazy as they are.

00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,287
Yeah, maybe.

Looks like this place
is gonna collapse.

Loud and clear.

is at the back of the building.

Where are we going?

00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,310
The door to the morgue

925
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,658
You sure this is
the right place?

926
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,293
He went down the wrong stairs.

927
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,195
There's only one set of stairs.

928
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,164
I know where they're going.

929
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,132
Hello?

930
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:32,335
Carter!

931
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,206
Better not be leading
us into a trap.

What's going on?

00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,988
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

936
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,423
Did you find it?

937
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:57,393
Is there some kind of
sub-basement or...

938
00:49:57,395 --> 00:50:00,262
No, no, no, what are
you talking about?

939
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,732
- A staircase going down.
- What?

00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,312

[eerie winds]

943
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,460
We gotta go back.

944
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:35,031
I can't ask you to
follow me down here.

945
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:36,699
You understand?

946
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:40,469
Guys, what's happening?

947
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,609
Nothing. We're...

948
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:49,078
We're gonna go down the stairs.

949
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,518
Hey, leading in with him.

950
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,387
Hey, you get to go first.

951
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,722
Yeah, right.

952
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,323
I'm not asking.

953
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:03,526

You won't be able to move.

959
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,197
What? Richard?

960
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,165
Be patient.

961
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,667
I'm almost ready.

962
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,769
What-what-what is this?

963
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:49,738
I saw you die.

964
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,511
I had no idea that it
would feel like this.

965
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:58,781
The years I spent
operating on people.

966
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,350
Opening them up and
stitching them back

967
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:03,819
together again.

968
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:07,756
It's remarkable, the
sensation it's...

969
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:11,293
not pain, more a
sense of release.

970
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,662
Why, why are you...

971
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:16,132
Be quiet, please.

972
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,934
This is uncharted territory.

973
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:23,506
The chance to study
my own transformation.

974
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:27,510
I understand your
hesitation, Allison, but

975
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:31,380
let me ask you, all these
years, haven't you ever

976
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:35,317
wished to save someone
beyond saving?

977
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,653
No matter what the costs?

978
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,258
Well, losing Sarah destroyed me.

979
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,464
But it also compelled
me to find a solution.

980
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:54,570
You'd be surprised at the
things you find when you

981
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,605
go looking.

I've seen this place before.

988
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:27,369
This was all over the
house we cleaned out.

989
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,804
He made us look at things.

990
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:31,941
The worst things I've ever seen.

991
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:36,412
We found rooms full of bodies in
the basement of that place.

992
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:38,981
They had someone on a
table like they were doing

993
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,883
surgery down there.

994
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,518
Half turned into
one of those things.

No!

996
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:46,822
No, worse than that.

Hey!

1008
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,886
Yeah.

1009

He has took me here to... baby.

I'm right here, kiddo.

It's okay, it's alright.

You're gonna be fine.

You're lucky your grandpa
cares about you so much.

- Alright.

00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,879
Okay, Maggie, hold
still for one second.

1021
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,614
I got this. Okay.

I do.

You travel on, reborn into
something else, like a

Until now I've only been able to
track the moth in its cocoon.

The body has to
adjust, of course.

It adapts.

We weren't built for
this kind of thing.

I made mistakes.

This is an end to the
cycle of life and death.
