1
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,160
Mom, Mom! Uncle Jonas is here!

2
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,920
No, it's not Tuesday today.

3
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
But it is. He's here.

4
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,320
So, after the Germans surrendered,

5
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,130
When did our King return to
orway from exile?

6
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,850
Um...

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,180
June 7th, 1945.

8
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,880
And on what date did the
Norwegian parliament

9
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,300
hold its first election
after the war?

10
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,550
- Um, July 6...
- Don't guess.

11
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,740
Eh...

12
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,780
August the...

13
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,110
On what date...

14
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,910
did the Norwegian parliament
hold its first election since the war?

15
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,930
Uh... August...

16
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,850
August 12th, 1945.

17
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,310
You have to help him more.

18
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm going to tell your wife
that he's your son.

19
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,820
And then, she can tell
the rest of your family.

20
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,830
Then you'll never see me again.

21
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,160
Stop! Please!

22
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,070
Wait!

23
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,860
- No!
- Jonas!

24
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,190
No! Jonas!

25
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,790
No!

26
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,620
Jonas!

27
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,920
Mom!

28
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,540
Mom?

29
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,220
Mom, come on!
We gotta get outta here!

30
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,590
Mom, come on!

31
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,180
Open the door!

32
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,320
Mom, come on!
Open the door!

33
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,060
Mom!

34
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,320
Mom!

35
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
No!

36
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,410
Don't leave me!

37
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,400
No!

38
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,030
Shit.

39
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,890
Good morning.

40
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,220
Subs by enwansix

41
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,260
Fuck!

42
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,210
Harry Hole?

43
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,480
Hello.

44
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,900
Dry rot throughout
the whole building.

45
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,260
And I'm afraid we found
some mold behind the walls.

46
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,820
Aspergillus.
Toxic and pathogenic.

47
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,310
Your landlord let me in
to spray the apartment.

48
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,300
I'm gonna have to
take all these panels off.

49
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,050
And this is above your bed.
Jesus Christ.

50
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,940
Is there anywhere else
that you could stay?

51
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,220
The air in here is so bad

52
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,670
you're actually killing
your house plants.

53
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,310
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

54
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,520
You are familiar with
Emanuel Vigeland?

55
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,990
The brothers' work was most
likely influenced by their father...

56
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,640
who turned to drink...

57
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,310
had an illegitimate child
with younger woman...

58
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,670
<i>What a tragedy.</i>

59
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,460
<i>Yeah, I didn't know that about him.</i>

60
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,040
You can clearly see
in each artist's case...

61
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,730
the recurring themes of
love perverted and betrayed.

62
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,590
The good news is that with this
new version of the EVISYNC...

63
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,430
from version 3.6 to version 4.0...

64
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,820
allows you to manually push
the data back to the server...

65
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,820
using the cellular network.

66
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,010
The EVISYNC will automatically
upload all the new data...

67
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,940
to the central police server
here every 12 hours.

68
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,860
We've also done some work
on the fingerprint scanning software.

69
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,370
So, you will notice
a significantly faster

70
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,760
opening time after
scanning your fingerprint.

71
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,750
But please make sure
that your fingerprint scans

72
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,260
are done cleanly
and clearly from the start.

73
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,200
If you are experiencing
a high number of false scans,

74
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,160
this is probably because
your fingerprints

75
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,530
were scanned incorrectly
from the start.

76
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,080
That must be nearly a whole
week of mail this time.

77
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,980
Did I miss anything
while I was away?

78
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,710
My uncle died.

79
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,350
Close, were you?

80
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,080
A leave of absence has to be
formally requested in writing.

81
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,740
Doesn't matter who you are.

82
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,590
Backdate it.

83
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,110
But I can't keep covering for you.

84
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,150
I'm dealing with it.

85
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,010
I need a case to work on.

86
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,910
I apologize for Oslo's
low murder rate.

87
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,670
Let's uh...
stick to the uncle story.

88
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,460
You scared my clients away.

89
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,600
I didn't forget Oleg's birthday.

90
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,850
I got him concert tickets.

91
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,890
What did you do?

92
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,330
We took him for a pizza.

93
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,440
Oleg misses you.

94
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,010
He doesn't get along
very well with Mathias.

95
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,840
What about you?

96
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,510
I'm not going to answer that.

97
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,300
He wants to meet his real father.

98
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't think he's ready for that.

99
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,020
Thank you for
walking me back home.

100
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,270
See you at the game.

101
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,950
Tell Oleg...

102
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,300
I'm sorry I missed it.

103
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,460
Hi.

104
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,570
The snowman.

105
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,800
Snowman.

106
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,820
I'll take a picture.

107
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,520
He's beautiful, honey.

108
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,610
Mommy!

109
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,700
Hi.

110
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,580
Hello.

111
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,370
- May I borrow your scarf?
- You want my scarf?

112
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,090
I told you
I had to leave by 8:00.

113
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,150
And I told you that
I had to help one of my students.

114
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,520
No, thanks.

115
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,480
It's the smoking room.

116
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,560
Yeah, but it's the only place
I can concentrate, so.

117
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,250
I'm um, I'm Katrine Bratt.

118
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,700
Harry Hole.

119
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,950
I know who you are. We um...

120
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,580
We actually studied
your cases at the academy.

121
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,630
I didn't know
they date back that far.

122
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,730
Yeah, you're up there
with the legends, so.

123
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,600
I don't know who you are.

124
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,250
No, I'm new. I um...
I transferred from Bergen.

125
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,000
Actually, they put me in your office.

126
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,140
Okay. Bye.

127
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,500
Mom?

128
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,640
Mommy?

129
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,290
Mommy?

130
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,550
Okay, where can I drop you?
I'm on a call.

131
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,950
It's okay. I'm in no hurry.

132
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,920
So, why don't you have a car?

133
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,830
I don't have a license.

134
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,650
Missing persons.

135
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,620
Yeah, it's a woman.
The uh, call just came in.

136
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,070
So, this machine
is called an EVISYNC...

137
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,900
I will record you, so there's
a little camera on the other side.

138
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,230
- Well aware of it.
- Right.

139
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,690
Would you like to
walk me through what happened?

140
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,150
W-well, I saw Josephine
in the garden in her pajamas...

141
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,430
and uh, I thought, what is
she doing out in this cold?

142
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,550
So I came over to check.

143
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,100
And she said
she couldn't find her mother.

144
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,100
I tried calling the father, but
apparently, he's away on business.

145
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,930
How long has she been missing?

146
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,840
Two days.

147
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,130
She said she was going to visit her
friend and she never came back.

148
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,560
Why did you come to me?
I've been suspended.

149
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,980
'Cause you're a friend.

150
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,640
And you're a great detective.

151
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,840
But I don't want anyone
knowing about this just yet.

152
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,830
Not yet. I don't
want to go to the police.

153
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,770
Can you tell me...

154
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,430
Was your wife seeing anyone?

155
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,710
I uh, checked her credit card bills.

156
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,930
She'd been to see
a pregnancy doctor.

157
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,490
Well, uh, that's
great news, Frederik.

158
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,040
We haven't shared a bed
in three years.

159
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,570
<i>This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.</i>

160
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,520
<i>This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.</i>

161
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,480
<i>This is Birte Becker.</i>

162
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,860
Hello, Mr. Donkey.

163
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,480
Can I sit down?

164
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,460
It's a nice place
you've got here, Mr. Donkey.

165
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,960
Did you do this by yourself?

166
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
My mom helped me.

167
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,710
Was she in a good mood
when she got home?

168
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,470
Mm-hmm.

169
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,840
And what about your dad?

170
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,240
He was grumpy again
'cause mommy was late.

171
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,690
Did she call
to say she'd be late?

172
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,870
My dad doesn't want me
to have a phone.

173
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,110
She didn't phone the house?

174
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,430
Is he grumpy often?

175
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,300
Has your mother been upset lately?

176
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,000
When your father's been grumpy?

177
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,510
Have you ever seen her cry?

178
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,270
No.

179
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,470
But I saw Daddy cry.

180
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,940
When?

181
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,800
A few nights ago.
He saw me too.

182
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,320
What did he do?

183
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,700
Locked himself in the bathroom.

184
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,350
Where was Mommy
hen he was crying?

185
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,430
She'd gone out

186
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,390
Oh, shit.

187
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,930
Yes, is this Filip Becker?

188
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,210
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

189
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,060
I better go. Thank you.

190
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,190
He cried last week.

191
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,990
Why did you build
the snowman facing the house?

192
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,750
I didn't build the snowman.

193
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,380
<i>This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.</i>

194
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,600
You want a coffee or something?

195
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,690
No.

196
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,610
Look, you're not gonna
try and sleep with me, are you?

197
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,650
No.

198
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,950
Okay, good.

199
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,500
She'll show up.

200
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,420
She's having an affair.

201
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,460
She left her coat and
her handbag in the house.

202
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,300
And the front door was open.

203
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,850
Even if you're having an affair,

204
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,810
you do not leave
your child like that.

205
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,360
And Harry, she's not the only one.
Look, this is Hege Dahl.

206
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,130
Missing two weeks. Similar age.
Young children.

207
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,040
Unhappy marriage.

208
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,340
Talk to the husband.

209
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,340
<i>411 to dispatch.
Dispatch, do you receive?</i>

210
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,800
<i>- Go ahead, 411.
- Now, I'm in Mount Ulriken.</i>

211
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,590
<i>It looks like a homicide.
Uh, adult female.</i>

212
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,360
<i>It's hard to see from here but,
uh, there's a lot of blood.</i>

213
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,780
<i>A group of school
children found her.</i>

214
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,590
<i>I've got a problem.
Rafto just showed up.</i>

215
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,440
<i>What the hell's he doing there?
He's been suspended.</i>

216
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,270
<i>Yeah, try telling him that.</i>

217
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,690
<i>We sent the kids
down with their teacher.</i>

218
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,880
<i>Make sure there's a
care officer to meet them.</i>

219
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,970
<i>And someone to deal
with the parents.</i>

220
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,950
One of the children heard a noise
and they went to see what it was.

221
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,440
Listen, John, I'm gonna need you
to calm down. Calm down.

222
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,510
It's important that
you answer my question.

223
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,660
<i>Who's in charge?</i>

224
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,140
<i>Svensson.</i>

225
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,500
<i>Jesus.</i>

226
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,730
<i>It gets worse.
Rafto just arrived.</i>

227
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,430
<i>Perfect.
The drunk and the halfwit.</i>

228
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,370
<i>Just keep them apart, will you?</i>

229
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,060
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

230
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,300
Where you going?

231
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,760
Rafto!

232
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,920
Rafto!

233
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,030
- We're closed.
- It's all right.

234
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,680
You have something of mine.

235
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,610
It's not yours.

236
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,910
Cold case.

237
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,490
I have clearance to take it out.
You don't.

238
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,820
So what, you gonna report me?

239
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,620
Eli Kvale.

240
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,720
Tell me.

241
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,460
She was married.

242
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,190
She had three children.

243
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,210
The 12th of November,
six years ago, she went missing.

244
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,450
And the day she vanished,
it was snowing.

245
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,990
Hege Dahl disappeared
the 8th of November.

246
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,950
The day she went missing,
it was snowing.

247
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,300
Not unusual, it's winter.

248
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,930
Now Birte Becker.

249
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,340
And the night she disappeared...

250
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,550
- Snowing.
- Yeah.

251
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,310
I think it's the falling snow
that sets the killer off.

252
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,630
And furthermore, they were married,
they all have children.

253
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,530
Did you talk to Filip Becker?

254
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,650
Nine times out of ten,
the husband did it.

255
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,960
He was interviewed,
and his alibi's solid.

256
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,940
He was 100 miles away.

257
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,180
Have you eaten?

258
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,850
No.

259
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,720
I haven't. I'm hungry.

260
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,490
28th, handball.

261
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,620
Josephine's handball match.

262
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,310
The 3rd, 'F. lunch'.

263
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,470
That's lunch
with her friend, Frida.

264
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,980
I really-I don't see
the point in doing this.

265
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,890
I won't keep you much longer.

266
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,060
9th, Vetlesen.
He's a doctor.

267
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,440
10th, yoga.

268
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,760
Do you have any idea why
your wife went to see him?

269
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,800
Who?

270
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,940
Dr. Vetlesen.

271
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,290
No.

272
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,500
10th, yoga.

273
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,690
Is there any reason
you can think of...

274
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,430
why your wife might
disappear so suddenly?

275
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,130
Your marriage.

276
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,200
Was everything all right?

277
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,230
Were either of you
having an affair?

278
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,900
Daddy!

279
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,000
Come on!

280
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,050
I promised her we'd walk
around the neighborhood

281
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,280
to see if we could
find her mother.

282
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,430
- I'm just getting my jacket, darling.
- Come out!

283
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,590
Dad!

284
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,440
Come inside.

285
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,610
I thought you wouldn't remember.

286
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,690
Is he still giving you a hard time?

287
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,270
If you want, I can talk to him.

288
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Oh!

289
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,070
Just have fun tonight.

290
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,080
He misses you.

291
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,540
Hi, Harry.

292
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,560
Good to see you.

293
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,030
Sorry I'm late, honey.

294
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,760
Have you had anything to eat?

295
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,510
No, I'll...
I'll grab something later.

296
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,650
No, no, but I've got vouchers.

297
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,180
- Yeah?
- Yup.

298
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,010
Hotdog or hotdog?

299
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,960
Well, hotdog then.

300
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,070
Harry?

301
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,080
I'll get something
to eat with Oleg.

302
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,970
So, how are things with you?

303
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,530
- All right.
- Yeah?

304
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,090
A bit tired.

305
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,460
You've been working too hard,
haven't you?

306
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,450
I can't sleep.

307
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,910
You should try Valcetet.

308
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,850
It's a new one.

309
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,410
It'll help you sleep.

310
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,090
I can give you
a prescription right now.

311
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

312
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,440
- With that?
- Yeah.

313
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,100
She won't allow me
to try and find my father.

314
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,530
Your mother
should be the judge of that.

315
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,650
She won't listen to me.

316
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,630
She's worried about you.

317
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,610
All she cares about is herself.

318
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,160
All she cares about is you.

319
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,110
That's why she dumped me.

320
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,930
I'm such a bad influence.

321
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,040
She's concerned.

322
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,730
Concerned about what?

323
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,900
The fact that
you'll run away from home.

324
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,860
The fact that
you've been drinking.

325
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,850
So, you're
gonna give me a lecture

326
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,540
about drinking?

327
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,050
Don't be a prick.

328
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,930
Your mom told me
the school's arranged

329
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,030
a father and son
camping trip.

330
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,270
If you want, I can come.

331
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,070
But you're not her
boyfriend anymore.

332
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,720
So?

333
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,460
Yeah. Yeah.

334
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,820
I want you to come.

335
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,750
- You sure?
- Yeah.

336
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,340
Good.

337
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,110
So, what's the... the big surprise?

338
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,650
Eh...

339
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,480
Let's find out.

340
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,390
Someone at work
got me the tickets.

341
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,220
You've got a message.

342
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,650
Let me see what it says.

343
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,890
I've gotta make a call.

344
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,540
Will you stay here?

345
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,470
<i>Harry, there's another missing woman.
In Geilo, this time.</i>

346
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,280
That's not our jurisdiction.

347
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,950
<i>I think we should
have a look at this.</i>

348
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,400
<i>I'm gonna be with you
in two minutes, okay?</i>

349
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,900
<i>Her husband specifically
asked for you.</i>

350
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,190
Hello.

351
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,150
- Hi.
- Oh.

352
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,140
I didn't expect you so early.

353
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,770
- Something came up.
- Oh.

354
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,360
Hi, Harry.

355
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,360
How was the concert?

356
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,090
Yeah, it was-it was great.

357
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,410
We spoke.

358
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,150
I'm taking him on the
father and son camping trip...

359
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,500
thing.

360
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,970
See you.

361
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,110
Hey.

362
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,470
Bye.

363
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,250
Take me home.
We'll go in the morning.

364
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,850
Who reported her missing?

365
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,960
Her husband, last night. 20:05.

366
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,070
Sylvia Ottersen, 33 years old.

367
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,120
Self-employed.

368
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,170
Married twice.

369
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,980
But no children.

370
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,040
Hello?

371
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,530
Hello?

372
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,640
Hello?

373
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

374
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,380
Can I help you?

375
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,690
Yeah, well, we're with the
Oslo police.

376
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,700
We got the missing persons call.

377
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,350
Oh. Who's missing?

378
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,340
Sylvia Ottersen.

379
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,240
I'm Sylvia Ottersen.

380
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,030
What? You're Sylvia Ottersen?

381
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:09,310
Why... why would your husband
report you missing?

382
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,030
I have no idea.

383
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,280
He's not the kind to
play practical jokes.

384
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,000
- Is he here?
- No.

385
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,430
He's gone to the station
to pick up my sister.

386
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,050
Okay.

387
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,660
Well, I guess
it must be a crank call.

388
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,910
We didn't know where you were,
so we had a look inside the house.

389
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,980
I turned your music off.
Sorry about that.

390
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,420
Thank you.

391
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,930
Can I just ask you...

392
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,970
Is it just you and your husband?
Or do you have any children?

393
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,230
No, it's just us.

394
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,750
Okay, thank you.

395
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,500
God, what do you think
you're doing?

396
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,150
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

397
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,530
Calling the police,
telling them I'm missing?

398
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,290
You think that's funny?

399
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,530
Don't you understand?
It's over.

400
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,730
I don't want to see you again.

401
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,300
No, it wasn't your child.
It was mine.

402
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,860
If you call one more time,
I'm going to the police.

403
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,800
<i>HQ to DC Bratt... DC Bratt?</i>

404
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,440
Yeah, speaking.

405
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,560
<i>We've had a missing persons report.
A woman named Sylvia Ottersen.</i>

406
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,340
Oh, no, she's fine.
W-we just left her.

407
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,840
<i>Well, the call came in
two minutes ago.</i>

408
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,570
<i>Her husband asked specifically
for Inspector Hole.</i>

409
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,500
How could...

410
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,820
Turn the car around.

411
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,420
Sylvia?

412
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,080
Sorry we're back, Mrs. Ottersen.

413
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,360
We just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

414
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,620
I'm Ane Pedersen.

415
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,690
Sylvia's my sister.
We're twins.

416
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,130
Who are you?

417
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,620
- Is that enough?
- Yeah, keep going.

418
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,730
Did you find Hagen?

419
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,810
He's at the dinner
at City Hall.

420
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,790
Keep it clear, if you can.

421
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,190
Well, she always liked men.

422
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,510
Ever since we were teenagers.

423
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,110
She was a good person.

424
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,480
She didn't want to hurt anyone.

425
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,340
It's just the way she was.

426
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,610
I know your sister
didn't have any children.

427
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,790
It was just that there was something
in her reaction that when I asked...

428
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,430
She was pregnant.

429
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:05,240
She wasn't sure
who the father was.

430
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,040
She got rid of the baby
a few weeks ago.

431
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing our guest of honor...

432
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,910
King of industry, philanthropist...

433
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,480
and head of Oslo's Winter Games bid...

434
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,980
Arve Stop.

435
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,650
So lovely for you
to be here for us.

436
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,790
I'm not on the list, but
I know many of these

437
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,650
people are supposed
to be on the list.

438
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,920
I'm the most old friend
of Arve Stop's, you see.

439
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,000
There's been some
kind of misunderstanding.

440
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,940
- I have a person named Vetlesen.
- Come right up, yeah you can come in.

441
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,940
He says he's
a friend of Arve Stop.

442
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,110
No, wait, wait.

443
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,600
No, it's fine, No, just relax.
Just relax.

444
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,340
I wonder, with a dozen companies...

445
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,040
when people ask me why...

446
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,580
I've given up so much
of my time to lead this bid.

447
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,310
I tell them, it's because
I never had these opportunities.

448
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,800
When I was a boy, the only
winter sports I engaged in were...

449
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,040
the uphill snow shovel
and the 50-meter firewood carry.

450
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,470
That is why I believe
passionately...

451
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,150
that this Cup is about
much more than just

452
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,440
publicity for our fair city.

453
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,460
Homicides?

454
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:11,120
Just missing persons for now.
But the pattern is disturbing.

455
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,680
And... I received this.

456
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,490
Prints?

457
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,400
It isn't just the letter.

458
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,090
He reported her missing
before he killed her.

459
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,290
He was watching us
the entire time.

460
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,910
- What do you need?
- Small team.

461
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,210
I'll set up a separate
incident room at the mill.

462
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,990
All right. I don't want a word
of this to be leaked to the...

463
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,060
- To the press.
- the press, yeah.

464
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,010
Not until this fucking bid is over.

465
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,340
Try to... Just... try to smile.

466
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,720
Smile, it's good.

467
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,710
Does this strike you as the
proper time and place for this?

468
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,250
Wait.

469
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,780
Idiot.

470
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:47,970
What? Arve?

471
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:52,900
What? No, don't cry.
Listen, why...

472
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,940
Shit.

473
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,500
Hey.

474
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:25,060
Hey!

475
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:32,730
Get out.

476
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,240
Get out!

477
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,310
Hey!

478
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,770
Oi! Hey!

479
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,340
Annette Elden, 33, disappeared
12th of December, 2006.

480
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,060
Her head washed
ashore near Arendal.

481
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,990
The rest of the body
never found.

482
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,870
Forensic report indicates
saw marks on her neck.

483
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,020
Status: Unmarried.
Two children by different fathers.

484
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,480
Harry, I've got the
names and the addresses

485
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,900
of Sylvia Ottersen's boyfriends.

486
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,530
Now, she went to the clinic
the 2nd of November...

487
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,770
but they won't break
patient confidentiality.

488
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:31,210
They do, however, perform abortions.

489
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,290
What is it?

490
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,370
- Magnus, get me the list.
- What list?

491
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,630
The list of doctors at the Gellion.

492
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,040
I'm thinking that he's going...

493
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,160
- after women that he disapproves of.
- Here.

494
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,960
All the doctors at Gellion
from the last five years.

495
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,240
How did he know?

496
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:57,310
How did he know
Sylvia Ottersen was pregnant?

497
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,370
Idar Vetlesen.

498
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,750
Birte Becker had an
appointment with the same doctor.

499
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,450
Dr. Idar Vetlesen?

500
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,440
Yes, that's me.

501
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,130
Step in.

502
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,150
Birte Becker and Sylvia Ottersen
were both patients of yours?

503
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,310
Uh, no, they were both
patients at the clinic.

504
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,680
Uh, I never met Sylvia Ottersen.

505
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,340
Can you tell me who treated her?

506
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,470
No, I'm bound
by patient confidentiality.

507
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,010
She's dead.

508
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:56,290
Oh.

509
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,350
Oh, no.

510
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,720
Wait... well, doctor confidentiality.

511
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,120
In theory, would it be possible for
you to access her medical files?

512
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,720
Even if you didn't
treat her yourself?

513
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,300
Well, in theory, yes.

514
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:12,060
The doctors at the clinic have
access to the files of every patient...

515
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,980
should they choose to
look at them, which I did not.

516
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,870
What did you see Birte Becker about?

517
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,410
Well, that is uh, confidential.

518
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,230
How do you know Arve Stop?

519
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,730
- Arve?
- Hmm.

520
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,240
Well, I've known Arve for years.

521
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,110
I do research on premature birth.

522
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,130
We have a small charity, and...

523
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,030
Arve Stop is one of
our biggest supporters.

524
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:38,080
Huh, I wouldn't have thought a man
who goes on so much about family values

525
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,750
would support a clinic
that specializes in abortion.

526
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,380
Well, we specialize
in many different areas.

527
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,230
Hmm.

528
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,890
And Mr. Stop supports our
research in premature birth.

529
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,810
So, do you see each other socially?

530
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,310
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you mean.

531
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,190
It's quite simple, actually.
Do you have friends in common?

532
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,150
Yes, we-we mix in the same circles, so.

533
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,600
W-why are you uh...

534
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:01,500
To know if you were...

535
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:04,200
Have you ever practiced in other
parts of the country, Dr. Vetlesen?

536
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,800
Yes, I have in Eidsvoll,
in uh, Lillehammer.

537
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,340
I see you have a picture of
Mon Plaisir pavilion...

538
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,570
- in Bergen.
- Yes, yes, in Bergen.

539
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,900
Do you live alone?

540
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:19,280
Yes, I uh, I am a reluctant bachelor.

541
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,420
Is there anyone
in the house right now?

542
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,240
Because I thought I saw someone
in the window when I passed.

543
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:32,070
Well, if you want to take a look around,
I will need to see a search warrant.

544
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,680
In fact, if you don't mind,

545
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,800
I would like to call my lawyer...

546
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,360
before I answer any more
of your questions.

547
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,570
That won't be necessary,
Dr. Vetlesen.

548
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,280
You can bring your lawyer
when we see you next time.

549
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,770
- Hey.
- Hi.

550
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,930
What was that?

551
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,530
- What?
- He isn't a suspect yet.

552
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,860
We needed permission
to search the house.

553
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,310
I know that.

554
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,870
Why'd you ask him
about Arve Stop?

555
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,200
I saw a picture
of them both together.

556
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:10,750
And?

557
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,030
And it was an innocent question.

558
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:15,950
Jesus, anyone can see he's
trying to hide something, right?

559
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,680
Cloudberry.

560
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,910
If you hadn't told me
to look out for it,

561
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,330
I'd have assumed she was
attached to his security detail.

562
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,570
Cloudberry?

563
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,510
It's her password.

564
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,530
<i>Does this strike you as the
proper time and place for this?</i>

565
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,530
Arve Stop.

566
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,480
<i>Idiot.</i>

567
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,480
She filmed him at rallies...

568
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:07,740
at restaurants, at home.

569
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,510
Hi.

570
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,660
Do you want a ride?

571
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:34,690
No.

572
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,270
Bye.

573
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,800
<i>The 8:45 train to Bergen
leaving on platform five.</i>

574
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:50,720
Oh, sorry.

575
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,420
<i>This is the 8:45
service to Bergen</i>

576
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,770
<i>which stops in Gol,
Finse, Voss and Bergen.</i>

577
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:03,090
<i>The next station is Gol.</i>

578
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,040
Hi, Harry.

579
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,900
Hi.

580
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,870
Hiding in the playroom, are we?

581
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,970
Yes.

582
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,130
Don't worry,
I'm getting off at the next stop.

583
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,000
Going far?

584
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,140
Bergen.

585
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,440
Ah, rather you than me.

586
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:43,900
Then again, I'm attending
a three-day conference on

587
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:46,450
bio-identical hormone restoration.

588
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,810
I thought you were a plastic surgeon?

589
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,120
Well, you know...

590
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,510
Cosmetic surgery needs
to move with the times, too.

591
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,420
We're swapping the scalpel
for hormone replacement therapy.

592
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:01,110
If you can slow down
the aging process...

593
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,200
there won't be any
need for face-lifts, will there?

594
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,260
I'll bear that in mind.

595
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,750
So, how's the prescription working?

596
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,750
Sleeping like a baby.

597
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,430
Splendid.

598
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,770
So, you, you canceled the Oleg thing?

599
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,900
The school trip?

600
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,750
Weren't you supposed to...

601
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,540
Oh, shit.

602
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,120
- Shit!
- I'm sorry, Harry, uh...

603
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,050
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Oleg, you coming?

604
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,250
Come on.

605
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,350
He knows how busy you are.

606
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,650
Shit.

607
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,050
Look, look, y-you're
not his father, Harry.

608
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,640
What does that mean?

609
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,250
Well, uh...

610
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,210
I don't have to be
his father to care about him.

611
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,620
I'm trying to say that...

612
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,480
it's a big enough responsibility
for a real father, isn't it?

613
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,660
Let alone you and me.

614
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:00,700
I'm sorry, Harry.

615
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,920
No.

616
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,470
Did you hear from him?

617
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,300
Why can't I go?

618
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,590
Can I go with you?

619
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:14,610
It's done!

620
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,070
Hi, Oleg, it's Mathias.

621
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,780
You know what, uh, I forgot to
check my messages last night, and...

622
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,780
Harry called to say that
he couldn't make your trip.

623
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,000
No, I know.

624
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:34,900
No, h-he couldn't get through
to you or you mom, apparently.

625
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:38,920
No, it's totally my fault, Oleg.

626
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,820
Yes... yes... I'm sorry.

627
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,190
Sorry, Oleg... yes...

628
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:45,970
Yeah.

629
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:51,070
So, I'll see you in a few days, then...
when I'm back from the conference.

630
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,150
You didn't have to do that.

631
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,050
Ready? That's it.

632
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,820
Hey, Aasen, someone here
to speak to you.

633
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,310
Aasen.

634
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,040
My family owned
all of these buildings.

635
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,550
And that house over there, too.

636
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,500
Arve Stop worked for us back then.

637
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,630
He was uh, bright, ambitious.

638
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,160
My father really believed in him.

639
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:18,370
The business wasn't going very well,
so we, uh, offered him a stake.

640
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,300
And within a year,
he had forced us out.

641
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,400
Sold the land for a fortune.

642
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,320
Have any of my colleagues
been in touch with you recently?

643
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,930
A young lady?

644
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,950
No.

645
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:40,260
I look at this picture now...
See Laila staring at him.

646
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,230
I had no idea at the time.

647
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,480
Family man, eh?

648
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,330
Do you remember the name
of your wife's doctor?

649
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:56,490
Sure. Morton Freiberg.

650
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:04,200
Did she... ever see someone
called Vetlesen?

651
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,940
Vetlesen? No.

652
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,110
Dr. Idar Vetlesen.

653
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,790
No.

654
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:19,690
Any idea where I might find the
officer who's in charge of the case?

655
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:24,980
Rafto? H-he died.

656
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:29,350
Yeah, h-he died around
the same time.

657
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:17,580
Detective Rafto.

658
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,630
Can you connect me
to Haukeland hospital?

659
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,240
What is this?
Am I under arrest?

660
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,110
A cake?

661
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:29,100
I need some information on a patient.
Laila Aasen.

662
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:33,420
No, I don't-listen to me.
I don't know the admitting doctor.

663
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,860
But perhaps she was there
for an abortion?

I heard he was a great detective.

678
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,370
He was a suicidal maniac.

679
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,490
They were going to
suspend him, anyway.

680
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:29,270
They found stuff in his drawers.

681
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,420
Items he'd stolen from
various crime scenes.

682
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,610
Is this him?

683
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,030
Where'd you get this?

684
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:38,670
From a colleague.

685
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,220
Yes, that's him.

686
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:46,630
He had this cabin
up on the coast.

687
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:49,130
He used to get up there
to get smashed.

688
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,720
He was probably drunk
when he shot himself.

689
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,730
They look like coffee beans.

690
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,570
Maybe he was trying
to sober up after all.

691
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,360
You didn't check?

692
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,250
The cabin was locked
from the inside.

693
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,620
And he looked like that
when they found him.

694
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:12,030
There wasn't anything
<i>to</i> check.

695
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,670
Did he have any family?

696
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,380
Wife who left him a year
before he killed himself. Uh...

697
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,950
I think there was a daughter.

698
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,340
You know where is now?

699
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,630
Not a clue.

700
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,520
Is the cabin still there?

701
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:39,790
<i>What are you doing to my
fucking gun, you idiot?</i>

702
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,600
Where's Harry?

703
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,500
In Bergen.

704
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,950
- Hello?
- Mr. Hole?

705
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:40,630
This is Harry Hole's phone.

706
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,210
Can I speak to him?

707
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,790
He's not here right now, but
I can take the message for him.

708
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:49,170
<i>Right, okay. Uh, this is Rebecca,
NRS at Telenor.</i>

709
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,340
We picked up a signal from
a missing person's phone.

710
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,780
Case number MP2.

711
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,060
Um, I don't have any files
in front of me. Um, who's that?

712
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,110
I'll check...
Birte Becker.

713
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:05,100
- Wha... is it transmitting now?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

714
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,840
Just got it in minutes ago.

715
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,770
Yeah, but, w-wait,
is it moving right now?

716
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,680
<i>No.</i>

717
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,310
I'll send you the coordinates.

718
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:12,890
No, just, w-what's the address?

719
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:18,200
Uh, Parkway 1, 0139 Oslo.

720
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,750
You sure that's correct?

721
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,240
<i>Yes, Parkway 1.</i>

722
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,490
Hey, are you all right?

723
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,740
<i>This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.</i>

724
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,970
Wednesday, unless you...

725
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,140
Yes?

726
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:22,930
- In his own garage?
- Yeah.

727
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,380
Ah, the great Harry Hole.

728
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:52,210
How many bodies?

729
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:54,400
Birte Becker and Ms. Dahl.

730
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:55,640
Where's Katrine?

731
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:56,720
Suspended.

732
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:59,040
She got a call telling her
they traced the Becker phone

733
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,990
and didn't think to tell anyone.

734
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:03,170
I asked you where she was.

735
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,020
That's not my problem right now.

736
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,880
He shot himself straight on.

737
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,970
How'd he do that with a shotgun?

738
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,660
It's too long, you have to angle it.

739
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,770
Pellet marks should be
up there somewhere.

740
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,940
Luckily, we have experts
to determine that.

741
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,880
You sure he was alone?

742
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,890
The garage door was closed.
One set of footprints.

743
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:30,680
We found two bodies in the house
and Birte Becker's phone.

744
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:34,340
It was a suicide.

745
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,200
Case closed.

746
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,730
Mathias, listen,
I have no idea where he's gone.

747
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,110
Yes, I've checked my messages,
he hasn't called.

748
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:54,590
Oh, well, how can you help?
You're at your bloody conference!

749
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:57,860
Can I keep this?

750
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,340
Can I keep this?

751
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,010
Yeah, sure.

752
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,380
She's not picking up.

753
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,410
Katrine!

754
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,590
Get off me!

755
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:48,590
Stop.

756
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:58,950
I guess congratulations are in order.

757
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:04,980
You know it wasn't that creep.
Vetlesen didn't commit suicide.

758
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,780
Someone killed him because
we got too close.

759
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,080
Like your father.

760
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,060
My father would never have
committed suicide.

761
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,800
He would never have
left me like that.

762
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,080
Get off me.

763
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,830
Get off me, get off me!

764
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,040
Get off me!

765
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:31,890
Get off me you fucking drunk!

766
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,190
Get off.

767
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,150
Get off.

768
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,250
Yeah.

769
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,530
I'm a drunk.

770
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,620
Like your father.

771
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:05,510
Laila Aasen and Arve Stop
were having an affair...

772
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:09,220
and that's the last thing my father
was investigating before he got killed.

773
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,490
You broke in to Vetlesen's house

774
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,120
because you were afraid
I'd find out this was personal

775
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,510
and take you off the case.

776
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,210
Vetlesen was his pimp.

777
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,530
And they were both in Bergen
when the murders started.

778
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:25,270
I know how much you want this,
but you can't force the pieces to fit.

779
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:28,560
I called the Gellion clinic
and Vetlesen wasn't even working

780
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,840
the day he was supposed
to meet Birte Becker.

781
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,170
They found two dead bodies in his
house and Birte Becker's phone.

782
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:36,550
Isn't that convenient, then?

783
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,090
So Hagen has his killer
and Arve Stop's safe.

784
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,620
And no questions are asked.

785
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,720
Do you actually think
he killed them?

786
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,170
I don't know.

787
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,590
I don't think either of us
do for sure.

788
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:56,780
Maybe this will bring your balls back.

789
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,290
I'm gonna need your weapon.

790
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,600
It's right there
in front of you.

791
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,610
Why did he call you Cloudberry?

792
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:49,170
Because I liked
cloudberry jam with ice cream.

793
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:25,660
Oleg ran away again.

794
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:46,560
It doesn't really matter if
we win or lose this bid tonight.

795
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,730
What matters most is that...

796
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,970
we celebrate the way
this has brought us together.

797
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,370
And use that energy to restore
the values that make Noway great.

798
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:58,280
And so, it doesn't matter if uh...

799
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:01,450
56 minutes and 33 seconds
from now, but who's counting...

800
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:07,320
if the World Cup goes to
Beijing or Denver or Montreal.

801
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:10,620
Because I believe in my heart...

802
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:12,520
tonight...

803
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:14,790
Oslo has already won.

804
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:21,970
I tried calling.
I thought he might be with you.

805
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,390
Oh.

806
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:27,240
He's okay.
He's uh, he's at a friend's house.

807
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:30,720
Just didn't bother calling me.

808
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,920
What did you argue about?

809
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,700
He doesn't want to leave the city.

810
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,950
I thought that change
would be good for him.

811
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,100
Well, for me too.

812
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,230
Where?

813
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,960
Um, Mathias has a house uh,
up in Telemark.

814
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:57,150
And because he consults
all over the place...

815
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:59,330
it's not too inconvenient.

816
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:03,180
I saw him the other day,
he didn't mention anything.

817
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,240
Is that really what you want?

818
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,990
I don't know what I want.

819
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,050
I miss you.

820
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:30,770
<i>My head says 50/50,
but in my heart, 100%.</i>

821
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,980
Thank you for coming.

822
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:34,590
Mr. Stop?
Mr. Stop, I'm sorry, I um...

823
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,230
I just want to thank you.

824
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,760
I really liked your speech.

825
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,620
I found it very... very moving.

826
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:45,630
Well, you see, I uh...

827
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:49,300
I was an orphan myself, so...

828
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:54,250
Well, it doesn't have to be
a disadvantage, young lady.

829
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,920
It can motivate us, too.

830
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:58,380
Oh.

831
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,880
Well, yes.

832
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:07,260
I work in Bergen with-
with young people in a care center

833
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:09,410
and I know how-
how very busy you are.

834
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:10,930
But if ever you're
ever in the city...

835
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,540
I started my career in Bergen.

836
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,370
Write to me.
I'll see what I can do.

837
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,020
Yes, I'm so sorry, I know...

838
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,980
I know people are waiting
to talk to you. Thank you.

839
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,830
- Not at all.
- Oh.

840
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:28,190
Yes.

841
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:37,250
Mr. Stop wanted me to let you know
how much he enjoyed your conversation.

842
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:40,130
- Oh.
- It's um, it's room 472.

843
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:44,030
He'll be free after
the announcement

844
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:46,160
if there's anything else
you'd like to ask him.

845
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,550
Thank you.

846
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,410
Mathias.

847
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,060
<i>Where are you?</i>

848
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,510
I just tried calling you
on the landline.

849
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,900
I'm at Harry's.

850
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:56,210
<i>Yeah?</i>

851
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:00,230
Because I phoned Eric's parents
and Oleg wasn't there either, so...

852
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,580
<i>No, no. I found him.</i>

853
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,910
He was with another friend.

854
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:08,810
Are you okay?

855
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,890
Yes, I-I'm fine now.

856
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:15,980
Mathias...

857
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,300
<i>Eh, I've got to run now to one
of those boring dinners, but...</i>

858
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,850
I'll call you in the morning
when I'm back. Okay?

859
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:35,230
Shit.

860
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,880
You couldn't have asked
another doctor?

861
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:28,660
What?

862
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,170
<i>Two minutes,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

863
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:16,610
Hello?

864
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:19,860
Hello?

865
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,010
<i>And to all our viewers
around the world, thank you...</i>

866
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,270
No. No!

867
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:38,830
Stop. No!

868
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,320
No!

869
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:44,920
<i>Of Beijing, Denver, Oslo
and Montreal.</i>

870
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,330
No!

871
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,090
<i>There can only be one winner.</i>

872
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,210
<i>The 15th Winter Sports
World Cup...</i>

873
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:03,960
<i>has been awarded to...</i>

874
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,590
Two, one...

875
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,370
<i>Oslo.</i>

876
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:39,140
Oslo! Oslo! Oslo!

877
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,520
Congrats to us all.

878
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:00,190
Hoo-hoo.

879
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:45,700
That's the last
of her files to download.

880
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:47,790
There's nothing after that.

881
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:51,790
Get me a list of
all the phone calls

882
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,830
and appointments she made
while I was away.

883
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,180
Magnus!

884
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:01,530
Yeah, sure.

885
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,970
When was this taken?

886
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,460
Two days ago.

887
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:10,670
<i>- No, no. I'm late...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

888
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:12,530
<i>to get her to school.
I have to get to work.</i>

889
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,830
<i>I'm sorry. I have one quick
question I need to ask you.</i>

890
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,700
<i>- We have been over this...
- I know.</i>

891
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:17,650
<i>hundreds of times.</i>

892
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,200
<i>I know we have been over this
a hundred times,</i>

893
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:20,370
<i>but I need to sort something out.</i>

894
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,030
<i>Dr. Vetlesen was not
working at the clinic</i>

895
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,800
<i>the day your wife
was supposed to see him.</i>

896
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,090
<i>He wasn't there..</i>

897
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:28,490
<i>So she got the date wrong.</i>

898
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,890
<i>- How...
- Daddy!</i>

899
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:31,940
<i>Josephine, in the car.</i>

900
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:35,550
<i>How the hell am I supposed to
remember what day we saw him?</i>

901
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,290
<i>Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.
Please help me.</i>

902
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:41,970
<i>How the hell am I supposed to
remember what day we saw him?</i>

903
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:45,320
<i>Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.
Please help me.</i>

904
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,630
<i>How the hell am I supposed to
remember what day we saw him?</i>

905
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:49,500
<i>Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.</i>

906
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,730
<i>the hell am I supposed to
remember what day we saw him?</i>

907
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,380
<i>Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.</i>

908
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,860
<i>- what day we saw him?
- Sir...</i>

909
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,250
<i>- what day we saw him?
- Sir...</i>

910
01:35:57,310 --> 01:35:59,030
Yes, I want all those files.

911
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,500
Give me your car keys.

912
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:02,420
- What?
- And your phone.

913
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,160
Yes?

914
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:40,360
You told me Vetlesen was your
wife's doctor when we spoke.

915
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:43,740
And that you had no idea
why she'd gone to see him.

916
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:45,470
Yes.

917
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:50,810
But you told my colleague
you both went to see him.

918
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:53,790
She must have misheard me.

919
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:56,970
She recorded the interview.

920
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:05,150
Darling, go back inside.
I'll come in in a minute, okay?

921
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:09,720
Good girl.

922
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:12,650
She isn't mine.

923
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:17,800
Birte and I were trying
for another child.

924
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,970
We thought it might
save our marriage.

925
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:26,120
We had blood tests done in the
clinic for hormone treatment.

926
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:28,840
And it came out that...

927
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:31,800
she wasn't mine.

928
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:36,310
I am infertile.

929
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:38,450
Always been infertile.

930
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,320
Can't have children.

931
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,490
But she is mine.

932
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:47,630
Do you understand?

933
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,350
How can I not love her?

934
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:57,300
But you didn't see Vetlesen
the day you found out?

935
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:05,930
No, we saw some
hormone specialist.

936
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,530
Visiting consultant.

937
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:16,460
Do you know his name?

938
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,150
Yes?

939
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:30,820
Just a second.

940
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:33,670
Damn it.

941
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,090
I said I'm coming.

942
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:46,660
You never called.

943
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,020
Is Oleg back?

944
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:53,170
What? Oleg?
He-he's at school.

945
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,140
And Harry?

946
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:59,330
Is Harry here?

947
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:02,800
No.

948
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:04,080
No?

949
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:10,090
How did he convince you
to give him those pills?

950
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:12,180
He didn't.

951
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,990
You didn't have to do it for me.

952
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:17,980
I didn't do it for you.

953
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:30,110
It was never about you.

954
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,740
I'm outside his house.

955
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:48,740
I can't reach Rakel.
Send someone to her apartment.

956
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:14,590
Oleg.

957
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:16,550
Sorry to keep you waiting.

958
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,160
Why do you have Mom's phone?

959
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,230
Come on.

960
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,530
You and I have more
in common than you think.

961
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:08,220
I didn't know who
my father was either.

962
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:28,830
Magnus, track Rakel's phone.

963
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,350
Sorry, I...

964
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,940
All right.

965
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,840
Okay, Harry, we just
picked up a signal.

966
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:53,540
Heading west towards Telemark.

967
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:58,270
It is a red Volvo, registered to a
Mathias Lund-Helgesen...

968
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,280
Rjukan, 2421.

969
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:04,160
<i>The house is pretty remote.</i>

970
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,300
There-there's an access
road, but that's it.

971
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,970
And there's a big
lake around it.

972
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,830
Helicopters are grounded
because of the weather.

973
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,300
But Delta is on their way.

974
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:17,180
Anything on Mathias' family?

975
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:18,500
<i>Okay, I've got something here.</i>

976
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:23,010
Jonas Lund-Helgesen, former
police officer, lost his job in '89.

977
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:26,770
A scandal involving
a woman drowning in a car.

978
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:28,240
Probable suicide.

979
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:30,330
<i>She had a son.</i>

980
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,100
Stop!

981
01:42:31,190 --> 01:42:32,850
<i>Father, unknown.</i>

982
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,830
Please!

983
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:35,900
<i>He was sent to an orphanage.</i>

984
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:46,280
Who led the investigation
into the woman's disappearance?

985
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:49,660
<i>Some local talent in village nearby.</i>

986
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,000
<i>What's his name?</i>

987
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,170
Jonas Lund-Helgesen.

988
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:57,970
Jonas. No.
Please, stop!

989
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:19,080
Harry?

990
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:20,560
Harry!

991
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,950
We've lost him.

992
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,520
Sit down, Harry.

993
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,200
Pass me the gun.

994
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:46,300
I didn't think you'd find me.

995
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:51,820
Perhaps the pills helped after all.

996
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:56,640
I spoke to Filip Becker.

997
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:01,380
What's going to happen

998
01:46:01,410 --> 01:46:04,630
when Josephine Becker finds out
he isn't her father?

999
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,940
She'll still love him.

1000
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:10,490
Wrong answer.

1001
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,400
Let's try again.

1002
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:28,350
Was it right for Sylvia Ottersen
to kill her unborn child...

1003
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:32,350
simply because she couldn't
keep track of who the father was?

1004
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,910
That was her choice.

1005
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:41,080
Too short.

1006
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:43,120
Maybe she was afraid.

1007
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:49,100
What about you, Harry?

1008
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:52,860
You have a woman who loves you.

1009
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:55,670
A boy who's devoted to you.

1010
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:59,380
Why did you abandon them?

1011
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,900
They deserve better.

1012
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:07,660
Too easy.

1013
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:11,590
Because I'm selfish.

1014
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,570
I'm an addict.

1015
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,330
There isn't enough room for them.

1016
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:42,150
You know, when I first saw
your picture in the papers...

1017
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:45,850
with all those medals...

1018
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:51,930
I thought, "That man
must have a perfect family."

1019
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,500
And here you are.

1020
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,680
Last question.

1021
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:06,150
This boy...

1022
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:09,360
who doesn't even know
who his father is...

1023
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:13,630
who's had to put up with
so many men like you and me...

1024
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:15,430
taking his place.

1025
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,980
Does his mother deserve to live?

1026
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:28,910
Why don't you ask him?

1027
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:14,580
You all right?

1028
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,160
Kill him.

1029
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:20,860
Kill him.

1030
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,170
Kill him!

1031
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:01,090
Come on!

1032
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,960
I'm ready!

1033
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:06,610
I'm here!

1034
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,790
Come on!

1035
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:43,240
I know why you blame her.

1036
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:56,460
You've been wrong
the whole time.

1037
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:04,400
It wasn't her.

1038
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:13,080
It wasn't you mother
who didn't want you.

1039
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:17,630
<i>It was your father.</i>

1040
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:23,870
It would have been better for him...

1041
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,790
had you not been born.

1042
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:54,930
The pathologist detected traces
of the drug ketanome.

1043
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:57,190
And the direct cause of death
was drowning...

1044
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:59,140
as the result of blood
filling her lungs.

1045
01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:02,070
24 stab wounds were found
in her mouth...

1046
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:04,140
all at regular intervals...

1047
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,430
and at the same depth:
seven centimeters.

1048
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:09,740
The pathologist can't determine
what kind of weapon was used.

1049
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:12,320
And he's never seen
anything like it.

1050
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,700
I'll take it.

1051
