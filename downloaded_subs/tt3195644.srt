1
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,585
Who is it?

2
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:39,385
Hi, my name is Quinn,
I was looking for Elise?

3
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,931
It's okay, Warren.
Go upstairs.

4
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,602
I'm Elise.

5
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:51,563
Hi.

6
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,024
I'm sorry to bother
you like this.

7
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,652
I got your name from
Claire Ortirski's mom.

8
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,823
Mrs. Ostirski -- Emily,
sorry. Emily Ostirski.

9
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:06,537
Yeah, she told me you worked as a psychic and
that you were really amazing. And she saw you.

10
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:08,122
I remember her...Emily.

11
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:11,041
Yeah. She's awesome.
She's like, really nice.

12
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,211
And she told me
how great you were.

13
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,548
She gave me a phone number
for you, but it wasn't working.

14
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,631
So...

15
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:23,429
I'm really sorry to have...
just shown up like this.

16
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:24,889
It's okay.

17
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,892
But if you're looking
for a reading...

18
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:30,060
Unfortunately I don't
do those anymore.

19
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,146
I have money.
I brought, like, $50.

20
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:33,439
No, no. It's
not that, honey.

21
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:37,443
I just can't. And I'm
pretty busy, so...

22
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,860
It's okay.

23
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:43,866
Where did you come from?

24
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,743
Leland Park.

25
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:48,704
That's a long way.

26
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,332
Yeah, it's no big deal though. I mean,
I'm the one who just showed up.

27
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,542
I'm really sorry I've
wasted your time.

28
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:59,632
Why don't you
come in for a minute.

29
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,803
A good chat is never
time wasted, right?

30
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:12,144
I love the style
of your house. It's...

31
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:13,354
Thank you.

32
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,897
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

33
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,660
You're a very smart
girl, Quinn.

34
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,204
Depends on who asks.

35
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,622
No, you are.
You read a lot.

36
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,666
You have a lot of books
in that bag of yours.

37
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,251
Oh, yeah.

38
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,211
Yeah. I love reading.

39
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:40,798
What made you come
all the way here today?

40
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:46,762
I, I wanna talk to someone...

41
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,014
Who's not around anymore...

42
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:51,683
Who?

43
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:52,935
My mom.

44
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,356
She died a year
and a half ago.

45
00:04:58,774 --> 00:04:59,775
She had cancer.

46
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:04,864
I mean, well first, she had breast cancer.
And then, she had a mastectomy, but...

47
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:08,868
It decided to hang around
and travel to her lungs.

48
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,077
So...

49
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:14,290
Guess you could say it went and appeared to
her just as much as everyone else did.

50
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,750
Tell me about her.

51
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:19,628
She was great.

52
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,758
Like, I mean, she could always
hang out, with all of my friends...

53
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,595
She loved old music...

54
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:30,306
Like vinyl records
and stuff. And...

55
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:34,810
She always wanted
to talk to me.

56
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,481
Like...

57
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,821
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:50,493
No, no. It's okay.

59
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:55,664
It's like...

60
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,252
It's like sometimes I
can feel her around me.

61
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:04,006
Like at night, I'll
be in my room, or...

62
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,926
I'll be asleep, and, and
something will wake me up.

63
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:09,720
Or, you know, I find
things in weird places.

64
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:12,264
Like, I find my diary
somewhere strange.

65
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:19,814
I mean I guess
it's kinda crazy.

66
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,315
Not to me, it isn't.

67
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:28,614
You've tried to contact your
mother on your own, haven't you?

68
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,990
Yeah.

69
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,661
Yeah, I mean, I've...

70
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,331
I've asked her to talk
to me but, she never does.

71
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,000
That's why I came here.

72
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:42,128
You know...?

73
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:45,548
I really need to ask
her some questions.

74
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:50,970
I know what that's like.

75
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:01,272
All right.

76
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,857
You have to give
me a moment.

77
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:04,608
And I can't promise anything.

78
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,863
Here, please take a
little bit of money.

79
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:09,572
No...

80
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:13,200
I got out of this business. If I
accept that from you, I'm back in it.

81
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:19,123
Normally, we do this
downstairs in my reading room.

82
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:24,545
What's your mom's name?

83
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:26,714
Lily.

84
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,215
Lily Brenner.

85
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:32,636
Lily Brenner.

86
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,486
I'm calling out...

87
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,907
and trying to make
contact with Lily Brenner.

88
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:58,496
Lily, if you can hear
me, please talk to me.

89
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:07,004
Lily, are you out there?

90
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:15,054
- I can hear someone.
- Is it my mom?

91
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,478
No. It isn't your mother.

92
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:31,153
Go.

93
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:36,075
Go away, go.

94
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:02,058
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,438
Sorry. There's a reason I
had to stop doing this.

96
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,192
There's other people that do this.
You have to find one of them.

97
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:14,029
You're going to
be okay, Quinn.

98
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,199
But take my advice...

99
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:21,662
And do not try to contact your
mother on your own anymore.

100
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:27,626
You have to be very careful.

101
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:30,421
If you call out to
one of the dead...

102
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,259
All of them can hear you.

103
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:00,826
Are you there?

104
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:15,090
Mom?

105
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:44,953
Are you there?

106
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:11,647
You and I both
know it's a design....

107
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,733
No, today? No I
don't think so, no.

108
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,193
Hey, you know what?

109
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:19,780
What I mean is that I can't be
in two places at the same time.

110
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:22,616
Yeah. The whole building
needs to be rewired.

111
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,535
The original guys
really screwed it.

112
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,080
You know that's an entire
extra day of work for me.

113
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:29,164
You got that, right?

114
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:31,917
Hang on, Bill.

115
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,210
There's no food.

116
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:34,837
- Didn't you go to the grocery?
- Yeah. I did.

117
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,673
Well, what did you get,
I mean what's this? Quinoa?

118
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:39,550
<i>Quinoa?</i>

119
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:41,705
I have to go.

120
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:46,165
Yeah, of course I'm gonna call
the guy. I got to get the part.

121
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:47,558
Hang on, Bill.

122
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:51,061
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a photo.

123
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,022
- Why?
- It's for my blog.

124
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:56,066
None of what you just said
to me makes any sense.

125
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,150
It's not supposed to.

126
00:11:57,276 --> 00:12:00,571
Okay, well how about
don't blog it. Just eat it.

127
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,158
- That's a great T-shirt.
- You weird...

128
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:07,828
You're such a weird person. Nobody
cares what you're having for breakfast.

129
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:10,206
Will you just go get your
brother ready for school, please?

130
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,751
Alex.

131
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:16,212
Alex!

132
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:18,631
Come on. Get up.
Get ready for school.

133
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,049
I am.

134
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,676
God, it stinks in here.
Come on. Get up.

135
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,930
OK, fine. I'll tell dad.

136
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,390
Can you hold on a second?

137
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:31,435
- I was getting-- get out!
- Don't touch me!

138
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,047
<i>I'll never forget this.</i>

139
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:04,218
<i>You'll go to the end of the world. And
you'll find me waiting there.</i>

140
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:05,553
<i>Your servant.</i>

141
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,433
<i>You'll always find me
waiting there, your servant.</i>

142
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:16,772
Okay.

143
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:18,399
<i>I'll never forget this.</i>

144
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:22,987
Alright. I am. I'm
hurrying. Right, bye.

145
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,032
Why is it quiet?
Quiet's not good.

146
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,578
Alex. You see this face?

147
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:33,664
This is my whoop ass face. When you see
this face, it means I'm about to whoop ass.

148
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:34,415
Get ready.

149
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:35,916
Come on.

150
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:38,961
<i>You gave me life
when I was dying.</i>

151
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:41,046
<i>When I was leaving this world...</i>

152
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:43,382
- Quinn.
- You scared me!

153
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:45,425
I need to rely on you to
get him up and going.

154
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:46,886
He's lying around
like a corpse.

155
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:47,695
I did.

156
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,722
No, I need you to get
him ready for school.

157
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:51,182
Dad, I have to
learn my lines.

158
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,142
- When am I gonna do that?
- I need your help here.

159
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,225
I'm drowning.

160
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,062
He's running late. You
could've done this anytime.

161
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:58,080
You're being selfish.

162
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,691
Yeah, I'm being really selfish
for worrying about my future?

163
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:02,901
Just help me out.

164
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:07,198
Come on.

165
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,788
Oh. Good timing, Hector.

166
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,247
Now you got
to see Quinn.

167
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,249
- Were you waiting there?
- Shut up!

168
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,629
I wasn't, like, waiting.
I just came out.

169
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:22,712
I know.

170
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,174
So, what have you got first?

171
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:26,884
I'm not going to school today.

172
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,195
I have an audition for a
theater school on New York.

173
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,764
You serious?
That's awesome.

174
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:34,225
New York.
It's far away.

175
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,353
Quinn? You gotta
see these birds.

176
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:40,064
There's a flock of 'em at city hall.

177
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,690
But these ones are nicer.

178
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,276
But you can't eat them.

179
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:45,986
Sorry, kids...

180
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,614
Sometimes, she's not sure
about what she's saying.

181
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,199
I know her.

182
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,828
I know her.

183
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:56,413
That's what you have to look
forward to when you get old.

184
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:59,166
- Yeah, so do you.
- Yeah, but you'll get old first.

185
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,545
I can't wait for this thing.
We're taking the stairs.

186
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:03,045
No.

187
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,547
See you, Hector.

188
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,551
See ya. Later.

189
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:35,870
Mom. Help me get
through this.

190
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,299
<i> Quinn Brenner.</i>

191
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:00,728
- Hi there, Quinn.
- Yeah, hi.

192
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:04,315
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you...

193
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:07,359
I'm so excited. I'm a huge
fan of your school. I've...

194
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:09,195
You know. It's always been a
dream of mine to go there.

195
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,780
- I've always---
- Great.

196
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:12,281
Have you prepared
something for us?

197
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:13,657
Yeah, I have.

198
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,329
Whenever you're ready.

199
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,627
<i>I won't ever forget this.</i>

200
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:26,837
<i>You will go to the
end of the world,</i>

201
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:28,772
<i>and you will find
me waiting there.</i>

202
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,256
<i>Your servant.</i>

203
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:37,723
It's okay.
It's okay.

204
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:39,433
You can stop
the scene again.

205
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:41,435
Yeah, sorry.

206
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,645
I know...
I..

207
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:45,648
Do you wanna take a break
and come back in a little bit?

208
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:50,861
I hate him!

209
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:53,364
And I don't, I don't
mean I pretend hate him,

210
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,617
like, "really, I love you I'm just mad at
you". I actually, literally, hate him.

211
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,286
Save the word 'literally' for
when you're being literal.

212
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,412
Shut up!

213
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:02,081
I don't want this.

214
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:06,877
Look, we have a few months of parental guidance left
and then this reality we're currently living in is done.

215
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,712
That's what's so great about it.

216
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,548
You pick a college
on the opposite coast,

217
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,133
he becomes a
weekly phone call,

218
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,760
that turns into a monthly
phone call when you need money.

219
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:17,721
It's like he's not your dad anymore. He's
just a bank you visit on Thanksgiving.

220
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,057
But I'm not going
anywhere, Maggie!

221
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:23,477
I botched the audition, to
the one school I wanted to go to.

222
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:27,231
I don't have a backup
plan. It's over.

223
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,776
Lord, you are so born
to be an actress, Brenner.

224
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,069
"It's over".

225
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,446
No, I'm serious.

226
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:37,374
That school is all
that I wanted.

227
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,326
And my dad
wants me here,

228
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:40,911
raising my brother.

229
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:44,748
You're gonna be gone.

230
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,376
You're gonna be okay.

231
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,255
Everybody always says that.

232
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,426
Hey. Come on.

233
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:58,471
Oooh. Lesbi-friends.

234
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:00,848
Oh no, you're right.

235
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,350
Where's the nearest
Jesus Camp?

236
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,311
Have fun with
your little boys.

237
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:06,812
Goodbye. Goodbye.

238
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,025
Let's get out of here.

239
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:14,695
Come on, Lesbo.

240
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,630
Oh, no!

241
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:37,885
Someone help us, please!

242
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,930
On my count. 1, 2, 3.

243
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,270
Monitors showing kneecap...

244
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:02,034
Okay, we got multiple compound
fractures on the right leg...

245
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:09,457
163, dropping.
Rates degrading.

246
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,793
Okay, give me 1 amp of

247
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:12,711
Paddles at 360.

248
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:14,755
Charging, 360.

249
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,477
OK, we've got her.

250
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:11,436
We got her back.

251
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:13,689
Let's keep her stable, folks.

252
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,153
Mom?

253
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:28,078
Hey. It's dad.
Honey, I'm here.

254
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:35,377
Do you remember anything?

255
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:38,172
I was with Maggie.

256
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,222
Then there was this
man waving at me.

257
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:51,477
He was at the theater too.

258
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,108
Then everything went dark.

259
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,293
One second, hon.

260
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,676
Oh, Mr. Sean.
How you doing?

261
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,759
Hey, Harry.

262
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:29,181
Really sorry to hear about
what happened to your daughter.

263
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,184
Thanks, Harry.

264
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:34,812
She's here.
That's what counts.

265
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:37,148
The man who can't breathe.

266
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:40,276
The man who lives
in the vents.

267
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:45,739
I heard him, saying
your name last night.

268
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:48,534
I heard him
in your room.

269
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,995
While you were gone.

270
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:58,085
He's up there right now.

271
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:02,131
Standing in your room.

272
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:04,467
You will see him.

273
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:09,680
Surprise!

274
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:11,974
Welcome home, badass.

275
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:14,643
- Yay.
- Oh, my gosh. Quinn.

276
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,021
Yeah. A little busted.

277
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:19,690
Wheelchair's just until
the bones in her legs heal.

278
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:20,941
Thank God, huh.

279
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:21,859
Thank God.

280
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:24,236
I'm just happy that
you're gonna get better.

281
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,321
These people are crazy.

282
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:27,782
The way they drive around
this neighborhood, you know?

283
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:30,493
I'm so sorry this
happened to you.

284
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:32,620
Yeah, its... It's
pretty embarrassing.

285
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:35,456
- I sent some flowers.
- We got 'em.

286
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,254
Hey, can I sign this thing,
or what, is that cliche?

287
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:45,466
- No, knock yourself out.
- Okay.

288
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:54,225
Wow, you've been
saving that one.

289
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,811
Just had to wait for
Quinn to get hit by a car.

290
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:00,898
I think, she's done
being shown off now.

291
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:02,566
Listen, we just wanted
to see you, Quinn.

292
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,527
- Okay.
- Listen, anything you need...

293
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,277
Thanks, Ernesto.

294
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:06,402
I mean it...

295
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:07,947
See you later.

296
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,495
Home again, huh.

297
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:27,675
Alright, ready?

298
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:30,553
One, two, three...

299
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,602
Great neighbors we have, huh?

300
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,896
Crazy cat lady
on one side,

301
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,399
the boy who's clearly in
love with you on the other.

302
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,192
He's not in
love with me.

303
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:50,197
You know, everyone that looks
at me isn't in love with me, dad.

304
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,117
Especially since
I'm crippled now.

305
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:54,242
Hey...

306
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,036
No sarcasm.

307
00:23:57,246 --> 00:24:00,583
Not since I got you such
an awesome gift basket.

308
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:03,252
Everything you like.
Books...

309
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:09,008
Bell, in case you
want me to wait on you.

310
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,594
Some French food.
The French onion dip, oui?

311
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:16,974
Snacks.

312
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,850
What?

313
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:20,936
I'm vegetarian.

314
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:23,773
Really?

315
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:25,398
Yeah.

316
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,277
- When did that happen?
- Doesn't matter.

317
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:31,489
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

318
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:34,992
So...

319
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:38,412
Did any letters come
from my school?

320
00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:40,706
No, I don't want you to
worry about that right now.

321
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:43,751
The only thing I want you to think
about right now is getting better.

322
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:45,169
Understand?

323
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:49,381
Think of it as a gift-wrapped excuse to
do your favorite thing in the world:

324
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:51,091
Sleep.

325
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:10,963
Hey, you need me, I'll
totally hear the bell.

326
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:13,424
No, I'm fine.

327
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:29,940
Good night, Warren.

328
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,339
Goodnight, Jack.

329
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:13,038
What the hell was that?

330
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,383
I'm not making
this up, Mel.

331
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:25,760
It cracked my ceiling.

332
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:27,470
I'm not saying you are.

333
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:31,932
I'm just showing you that there's
nobody living above you right now.

334
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:33,391
See?

335
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:36,771
Yeah, well, I heard it.

336
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,941
And it came
from that room.

337
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,243
Mel, come look at this.

338
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:13,974
What the hell do you see now?
No one up here, huh?

339
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:16,018
I don't know
what to tell you.

340
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,438
Tell me who's gonna pay
for the crack in my ceiling.

341
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:21,148
Why can't I ever...

342
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:23,442
Quinn, where's the
frying pan, please?

343
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:25,194
Right drawer
on the far left.

344
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,822
Yeah, I looked there already.

345
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:30,699
You know what, I can't take
this right now. I'm too busy.

346
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,618
Alex, no eggs this morning.

347
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,829
Just find what you can in
the fridge for breakfast, okay?

348
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:36,122
<i>Whatever.</i>

349
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:38,124
Come on, Quinn,
eat your breakfast.

350
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:39,207
I don't want to.

351
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,501
You have to.

352
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:42,503
Can't taste it.

353
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:45,464
Can't taste anything anymore.

354
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:47,967
- Alex, are you dressed?
- Yes!

355
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:49,593
I went to see a psychic.

356
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:52,096
I wanted to talk to mom.

357
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:53,889
You what?

358
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:56,142
I went and saw a psychic
woman named Elise.

359
00:31:56,851 --> 00:31:58,978
Claire's mom gave
me her address.

360
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:01,814
- When was that?
- Like a month or so back.

361
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,650
Strange things have
been happening.

362
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:08,028
Like that knocking
I heard last night.

363
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:11,031
I think that was mom
trying to reach me.

364
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:12,115
Quinn...

365
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:15,453
I don't want you to
get any funny ideas.

366
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:18,705
You know, these nutcases, are...
they're paid to give you hope.

367
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:19,946
That's what they do.
They make stuff up.

368
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,625
Why couldn't that
have been her though?

369
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:24,420
What if she's trying
to tell me something?

370
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:27,089
Why don't you ever wanna talk
about her or acknowledge her?

371
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:28,482
I do talk about her.

372
00:32:28,507 --> 00:32:30,468
No you don't. You
just fight with me.

373
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:33,429
You keep all this chaos so you can
pretend that she never existed.

374
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:35,389
No, Quinn.

375
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:40,102
I see her every single day.

376
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:43,355
When I look at you.

377
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:09,816
Fine...

378
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:11,527
I'll help her.

379
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,195
But you're staying here.

380
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:22,663
I'm reaching out
to Lillith Brenner.

381
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,083
If you can hear me,
please answer me.

382
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:31,756
Your daughter may
be in danger.

383
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:33,340
She needs your help.

384
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,887
Please, Lily.

385
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:39,388
Answer me.

386
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:42,141
I need to speak with you.

387
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:46,270
Lily, please.

388
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:49,148
Show yourself.

389
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:01,679
What do you
want from her?

390
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:04,306
I know you're
not her mother.

391
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:06,434
She thinks you are.

392
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,559
But you aren't.

393
00:36:08,853 --> 00:36:10,938
And I'm not
afraid of you.

394
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,817
I know you're there.

395
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:09,580
I've fought many like
you in my time, demon.

396
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,382
Show yourself.

397
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:04,427
I can't...

398
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:07,555
I can't do
this anymore.

399
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:11,142
<i>Kate Witter is
still a bitch.</i>

400
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:13,227
<i>Mr.Paul is still hot.</i>

401
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:17,940
<i>Hector is still asking about
you in a really unsubtle way, like...</i>

402
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:20,067
<i>Oh, he just needs to stop.</i>.

403
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:24,071
<i>And everyone at school is pretending
that they care about prom,</i>

404
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:26,240
<i>and that they're gonna
wear ironic costumes.</i>

405
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:27,783
That sounds so fun.

406
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:29,452
<i>No, it's not.</i>

407
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,454
<i>It's the worst, believe me.</i>

408
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,790
<i> Oh, I wish someone would run
over my legs with a truck.</i>

409
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,755
Wait, so how's your
college application going?

410
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:42,840
<i>No, we're gonna
talk about you.</i>

411
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,717
<i>How's it going
with your dad?</i>

412
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:47,052
He's taking all
this time off work.

413
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:49,764
He's out talking to his boss
about it right now. It's like this...

414
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:51,766
It's like this whole
big situation.

415
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:52,849
That sucks.

416
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,642
Well...

417
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,870
<i>What do you do when you
need to go to the bathroom?</i>

418
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,277
<i>No.</i>

419
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,988
<i>No way. You
kidding me?</i>

420
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,240
<i>Hey, is that Alex?</i>

421
00:39:08,324 --> 00:39:09,074
What?

422
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,826
<i>Standing right
next to you?</i>

423
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:14,914
What? What are
you talking about?

424
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:16,331
<i>Alex.</i>

425
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:17,792
Just right...

426
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,335
Maggie.

427
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:25,173
Maggie?

428
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:32,842
Quinn.

429
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,031
What's happened?

430
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:37,765
Quinn.

431
00:41:37,848 --> 00:41:38,849
Are you hurt?

432
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:40,476
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

433
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,686
Someone's in here.

434
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,770
Someone in here?

435
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,400
I'm here now, it's okay.

436
00:41:55,407 --> 00:41:58,285
This will prevent her from moving in
a way that could injure her neck further.

437
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:00,704
Easy, honey.

438
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:05,834
Just hold still.

439
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:11,923
Thank you.

440
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:15,009
Quinn.

441
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:16,512
What happened?

442
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:19,265
I was thrown out of bed.

443
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:23,978
There was no one in your
room. I would have seen them.

444
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:26,856
It wasn't a person.

445
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,066
It was a...

446
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:35,322
Before, I thought that it was
mom trying to contact me.

447
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:38,451
But it's not.

448
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:40,911
It's something else.

449
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,582
Are you sure it wasn't
just a bad dream?

450
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:45,707
No.

451
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,751
I saw him.

452
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:49,795
He had on a mask.

453
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:53,340
He had on a
breathing mask.

454
00:42:54,091 --> 00:42:55,551
I believe you.

455
00:42:57,762 --> 00:42:58,762
I do...

456
00:42:58,888 --> 00:43:00,014
You're gonna be okay now.

457
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:02,391
Get some rest out here.

458
00:43:18,824 --> 00:43:20,409
I think we've done everything.

459
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:22,870
Come on.

460
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:24,246
Thank you very much.

461
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:30,418
Harry.

462
00:43:34,298 --> 00:43:35,925
She's gone.

463
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,511
She just wouldn't wake up.

464
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:41,388
Oh, Harry.

465
00:43:42,598 --> 00:43:43,682
I'm sorry.

466
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:47,186
People called
her the cat lady...

467
00:43:47,645 --> 00:43:49,021
Crazy lady, but...

468
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:50,314
She wasn't any of that.

469
00:43:51,357 --> 00:43:54,485
She was somebody. She meant
something. She was my wife.

470
00:43:56,153 --> 00:43:59,824
We were together fifty-two years.

471
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:03,244
She had her whole life,
before she got sick.

472
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:07,957
She was beautiful.

473
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:11,043
So, so beautiful.

474
00:44:11,544 --> 00:44:13,546
The most beautiful
girl in the whole town.

475
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:18,968
I knew she didn't have long...

476
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,637
I tried my best to tell her
what she meant to me.

477
00:44:22,471 --> 00:44:24,390
And the sad part is...

478
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:28,561
I don't think she understood
a word I was trying to say.

479
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,063
She knew what you said.

480
00:44:32,356 --> 00:44:34,191
She knows how
much you love her.

481
00:44:35,484 --> 00:44:36,484
Harry...

482
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:39,947
If you ever need anything,
anything...

483
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,243
Just tell me, okay?

484
00:44:44,743 --> 00:44:45,743
Thanks.

485
00:46:44,947 --> 00:46:46,073
No.

486
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:51,036
Help, help!

487
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:53,205
Help!

488
00:47:33,496 --> 00:47:36,415
Daddy! Help!

489
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:45,508
Dad, help!

490
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:47,383
Dad!

491
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:48,803
Help me.

492
00:47:49,553 --> 00:47:50,930
- Dad!
- Quinn!

493
00:47:57,561 --> 00:47:58,938
What are you doing up here?

494
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:04,777
Dad, I told you.

495
00:49:10,092 --> 00:49:12,386
Jesus, he jumped.

496
00:49:24,523 --> 00:49:25,523
Quinn!

497
00:49:26,192 --> 00:49:28,152
Dad! Help!

498
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:29,403
Help!

499
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:34,115
Quinn.

500
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:36,367
Quinn.

501
00:49:41,499 --> 00:49:44,293
- Who's there?
- It's Sean Brenner.

502
00:49:45,669 --> 00:49:47,338
I'm Quinn's father.

503
00:49:58,182 --> 00:50:00,768
I told her I don't really
give readings anymore.

504
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:03,062
Believe me, I wanna help.

505
00:50:03,187 --> 00:50:06,023
But this ability I have, to contact
the other side, I promised myself

506
00:50:06,148 --> 00:50:08,567
I wouldn't do it anymore.

507
00:50:09,068 --> 00:50:11,654
Look, I don't know
anything about this stuff.

508
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:15,199
I don't know what's
real, what's not.

509
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:16,951
I only know her.
She's real.

510
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:19,662
She's my daughter and
something's trying to kill her.

511
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,415
And I don't know
what to do to stop it.

512
00:50:23,374 --> 00:50:26,043
I can't let that happen
again, not after my wife.

513
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:29,839
She told me that
you lost your wife.

514
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:32,466
I'm so sorry.

515
00:50:41,517 --> 00:50:45,104
Loving someone is just,
delaying pain, isn't it?

516
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:48,649
Eventually you're gonna lose
them one way or the other.

517
00:50:52,153 --> 00:50:53,904
I lost my husband.

518
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:55,990
A year ago.

519
00:50:58,534 --> 00:51:00,202
He took his own life.

520
00:51:00,995 --> 00:51:03,122
So, I couldn't even blame fate.

521
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:08,753
He'd suffered depression
before, but I...

522
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:10,880
I never thought...

523
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:16,427
There's so many things
I needed to say to him.

524
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,556
'Goodbye' would have been nice.

525
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:29,398
So I tried to contact him.

526
00:51:29,523 --> 00:51:31,358
I just couldn't help it.

527
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,827
There are two worlds...

528
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:45,539
That exist, beyond
ours, Mr. Brenner.

529
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:52,088
Think of them as
light and dark.

530
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,758
I visited the dark
looking for him.

531
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,177
Something I've
never done before.

532
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,519
Something we, living people,
are not supposed to do.

533
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:11,148
But someone followed me back.

534
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:13,399
A woman.

535
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,154
An entity driven by evil.

536
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,325
Ever since then,
whenever I use my ability...

537
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,702
This woman...

538
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:26,539
I can hear her in my head.

539
00:52:26,664 --> 00:52:31,836
Screaming over and over,
that she's going to kill me.

540
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,299
I think...

541
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,803
No. I know...

542
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:42,847
If I continue
with this work...

543
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:45,015
She's going to kill me.

544
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:48,477
Then just, visit Quinn.

545
00:52:50,146 --> 00:52:52,273
That's all I ask. You won't
have to do anything else.

546
00:52:53,149 --> 00:52:54,400
Just talk to her.

547
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:00,989
Thank you.

548
00:53:08,622 --> 00:53:10,124
We're gonna be okay.

549
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:31,186
Quinn.

550
00:53:33,189 --> 00:53:34,273
Elise.

551
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:36,776
You came.

552
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:38,736
Lucky you look
good in white.

553
00:53:43,491 --> 00:53:45,326
What's happening to me?

554
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:49,789
One night after
you came to see me...

555
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,794
I had a vision of you.

556
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:56,629
You were standing
in the dark.

557
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:59,507
A man was walking toward you.

558
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,219
A man who couldn't breathe.

559
00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:07,681
I've been to that
dark place, too.

560
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:11,227
It's not a place
for pure souls.

561
00:54:12,353 --> 00:54:14,563
It's very dangerous.

562
00:54:15,272 --> 00:54:16,524
When you go there...

563
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:20,820
Things come back with you.

564
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,364
I don't wanna die, Elise.

565
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:29,495
You have a long
life ahead of you.

566
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:33,833
I cross my heart.

567
00:54:36,502 --> 00:54:39,380
I am here, with
Quinn Brenner.

568
00:54:41,298 --> 00:54:44,927
I want to speak to the entity
that has attached itself to her.

569
00:54:48,514 --> 00:54:49,974
Can you hear me?

570
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:55,896
Are you there?

571
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:34,370
Where is the man
who can't breathe?

572
00:56:34,495 --> 00:56:36,539
I wasn't trying
to upset him.

573
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:05,860
Get away from me!

574
00:57:06,485 --> 00:57:08,154
Get away!

575
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:40,019
I'm not going any further.

576
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:20,202
<i>I always wanted to know,</i>

577
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:22,329
<i>how I was gonna go.</i>

578
00:59:22,455 --> 00:59:24,582
<i>Tell me, friend.</i>

579
00:59:24,707 --> 00:59:27,376
<i>How I meet my end.</i>

580
01:00:11,212 --> 01:00:12,213
Elise?

581
01:00:15,132 --> 01:00:16,132
Elise.

582
01:00:16,634 --> 01:00:17,676
Elise, Elise.

583
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:23,432
Elise, wake up.

584
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:24,557
Elise.

585
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:32,608
Wake up... Elise!

586
01:00:42,827 --> 01:00:43,828
The woman...

587
01:00:43,994 --> 01:00:45,371
That wants to kill me...

588
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:48,165
Was waiting for me...

589
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,584
I'm sorry. I can't...

590
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:52,628
I can't help you.

591
01:00:52,711 --> 01:00:54,088
I'm sorry.

592
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:55,256
Elise...

593
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:03,139
<i>It's pretty great.</i>

594
01:01:03,222 --> 01:01:05,224
<i>Some of these rooms still
having equipment in them.</i>

595
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:07,184
I'm telling you, Dad.
These guys can help.

596
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,479
<i>Throughout this hospital over the
years, a lot of paranormal experts</i>

597
01:01:10,563 --> 01:01:11,772
<i>have come in here.</i>

598
01:01:11,856 --> 01:01:14,024
I don't know. They
look like fools.

599
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:17,236
They found a house that was
being haunted, and they cleaned it.

600
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:18,361
Trust me.

601
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:19,822
I don't.

602
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:23,075
Dad, we have to do something.

603
01:01:28,831 --> 01:01:30,458
I'm Sean, Quinn's dad.

604
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,168
- Hi. Specs.
- Tucker.

605
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:34,545
This is Alex.

606
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,297
Yeah, he's a big
fan of your website.

607
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,382
Web series.

608
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:41,886
I showed him that one where you
guys get the ghost at that hotel,

609
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:43,262
- The boiler room ghost?
- Oh, yeah.

610
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:45,723
- That was a good one.
- Thanks, little man.

611
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:47,128
Some of my best
editing on that one.

612
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:48,893
Definitely some of
our best editing.

613
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:51,145
So, do you guys do
this kind of thing often?

614
01:01:51,479 --> 01:01:52,479
Ghost hunting?

615
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,105
All the time.

616
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:57,526
Yeah. It's actually, all
we do. We literally,

617
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:00,154
don't do anything
else. Just this.

618
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:02,698
So what happens now?

619
01:02:03,157 --> 01:02:05,076
Probably five, maybe four.

620
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:07,912
Excuse me?

621
01:02:10,664 --> 01:02:11,957
And I'll have to call you back.

622
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,417
Text me some peeps.

623
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:15,002
Roger that.

624
01:02:15,795 --> 01:02:16,879
Come on, she's in here.

625
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:19,089
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

626
01:02:21,884 --> 01:02:22,884
Thanks.

627
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,470
Excuse me.

628
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:36,023
Now this custom-made camera of
mine is outfitted with a small lens.

629
01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,708
Basically, a hidden camera.

630
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:40,152
It's not basic.
And it's not hidden.

631
01:02:40,236 --> 01:02:44,281
'Cause we're keeping it right out in the open
to capture whatever may occur tonight.

632
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:45,825
We do hide it though sometimes.

633
01:02:51,122 --> 01:02:52,122
Thanks.

634
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:55,376
This, is our sound backup.

635
01:02:56,752 --> 01:02:59,755
Any noises, we'll
record it right here.

636
01:03:00,923 --> 01:03:02,191
What do I do?

637
01:03:02,275 --> 01:03:05,102
Nothing. You just go to
sleep like you normally would.

638
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:09,640
<i>We're the ones who'll stay awake.</i>

639
01:03:18,357 --> 01:03:19,525
Hello, Elise?

640
01:03:20,985 --> 01:03:22,486
It's been too long.

641
01:03:23,571 --> 01:03:25,823
I save here for special occasions.

642
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:35,582
That's her.

643
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:41,338
She says, one day, eventually,
I'm going to die by her hand.

644
01:03:42,006 --> 01:03:43,716
And I believe her.

645
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:47,178
That's why I had to
stop using my gift.

646
01:03:48,804 --> 01:03:51,182
But now, I'm realizing...

647
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:54,727
My gift is all I have.

648
01:03:55,728 --> 01:03:57,229
It's all I am.

649
01:03:57,897 --> 01:03:59,106
First of all...

650
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:01,984
Okay, you're more
than one thing.

651
01:04:03,068 --> 01:04:07,740
And second, you've been helping
people get rid of these spirits for so long.

652
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:10,242
Eventually, one of them
was gonna come after you.

653
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:13,120
You can't be afraid of her.

654
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,165
Alright? You're stronger than her.

655
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:21,212
- You're alive.
- Yes, I'm alive.

656
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:25,299
But I have spent more time on this
earth among the dead than the living.

657
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,346
Do you really think
we help people, Carl?

658
01:04:30,513 --> 01:04:31,972
We do what we can.

659
01:04:33,474 --> 01:04:37,561
If someone gets attacked by a person
on the street, they can go to the police.

660
01:04:38,062 --> 01:04:40,648
If they're attacked by
something they can't see,

661
01:04:41,023 --> 01:04:42,566
something they
can't comprehend...

662
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:45,194
Then we have people
like us to go to.

663
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:47,071
Here.

664
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:52,785
Look at what you
did for that family.

665
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:54,703
You saved them.

666
01:04:55,287 --> 01:04:58,624
That boy is a grown man
now, with a son of his own.

667
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,710
I don't want you to stop
helping families like them.

668
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:04,255
They need you too much.

669
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:41,208
- What's that?
- I don't know.

670
01:05:49,508 --> 01:05:50,509
She's up.

671
01:05:58,225 --> 01:05:59,351
- What?
- No.

672
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:02,480
She can't be doing
that, that's impossible.

673
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:04,398
Well, she's doing it.

674
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:24,418
Go, go.

675
01:06:51,153 --> 01:06:53,614
She's gone. Come on.

676
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:54,990
Look.

677
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:01,288
I gotta go get her.

678
01:07:02,123 --> 01:07:03,123
Yeah.

679
01:07:03,124 --> 01:07:04,375
Good idea, you should.

680
01:07:19,014 --> 01:07:20,014
Quinn?

681
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:24,394
Quinn.

682
01:07:36,157 --> 01:07:37,158
Where are you, honey?

683
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:40,910
Wait.

684
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:56,260
Here, keep the flashlight on the closet.

685
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:57,552
Yeah...

686
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:32,754
She took it off.

687
01:09:44,285 --> 01:09:45,285
Quinn.

688
01:09:48,456 --> 01:09:49,456
Quinn...

689
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,421
You're a useless
fucking father.

690
01:09:55,546 --> 01:09:58,174
Your wife had to die
to get away from you.

691
01:09:58,215 --> 01:09:58,716
No.

692
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,926
And now, I'd rather be dead, too.

693
01:10:01,427 --> 01:10:03,345
But I'm gonna
keep you alive,

694
01:10:03,429 --> 01:10:04,930
to watch you suffer.

695
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,974
I'll be waiting
in the dark.

696
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:09,435
When the pain
finally kills you.

697
01:10:11,228 --> 01:10:12,688
No! No!

698
01:10:12,772 --> 01:10:14,523
No!

699
01:10:17,193 --> 01:10:18,193
Quinn.

700
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:51,560
What do we do now?

701
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:52,394
I don't know.

702
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,980
We are not qualified for this.

703
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,664
This thing, and dark empty
rooms is way out of our league.

704
01:10:57,733 --> 01:10:58,442
What do you mean?

705
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:00,778
Are you telling me you have
no idea how to help us?

706
01:11:01,445 --> 01:11:02,445
No.

707
01:11:02,446 --> 01:11:05,574
Are you saying, that you're a couple
of goddamn internet pranksters?

708
01:11:05,658 --> 01:11:06,992
I let you in my
house, you bas---

709
01:11:07,118 --> 01:11:08,911
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

710
01:11:08,953 --> 01:11:11,997
- This isn't going to help Quinn!
- Get out! Get out of my house!

711
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:16,435
Let them stay.
We may need them.

712
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,295
What? What for?

713
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,551
To help me get rid of the foul parasite
that's attached itself to your daughter.

714
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:26,804
I need you to stay at
Ernesto's tonight, buddy.

715
01:11:26,887 --> 01:11:28,687
- But I wanna be here.
- I know.

716
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:31,058
I'm not leaving, Dad.

717
01:11:33,644 --> 01:11:34,644
Alex...

718
01:11:35,688 --> 01:11:36,981
We know you love her.

719
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,734
But you do not want to see the
things that tonight may show you.

720
01:11:41,402 --> 01:11:42,945
She's gonna feel your love.

721
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:46,574
Goodnight, buddy.

722
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:52,829
Now, what?

723
01:12:00,504 --> 01:12:04,842
This entity, is very powerful.

724
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:10,848
It's a spirit who used to live
in this building a long time ago.

725
01:12:10,931 --> 01:12:13,142
It's been alone
for a long time.

726
01:12:14,185 --> 01:12:16,145
But she's making it stronger.

727
01:12:16,687 --> 01:12:19,190
It's feeding on
her life force.

728
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:21,025
It wants to possess her?

729
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:23,903
Usually, entities
of this type...

730
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,696
Living in the dark...

731
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:28,657
They wanna possess
the bodies of the living.

732
01:12:28,783 --> 01:12:30,785
So that they can
leave the dark...

733
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,161
and return to life.

734
01:12:34,955 --> 01:12:37,083
But there's another kind of spirit.

735
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:43,964
It's an even worse kind.

736
01:12:45,758 --> 01:12:48,177
One that does not
wanna leave the dark.

737
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,721
That wants the
souls of the living...

738
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:52,848
to join it in
the shadows.

739
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:56,602
She's only half a
person right now.

740
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:59,688
After the accident,
it got half her soul.

741
01:13:00,314 --> 01:13:02,233
It needs all of it..

742
01:13:02,358 --> 01:13:05,111
And if we don't hurry,
it's going to get it.

743
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:06,487
Okay, what do we do now?

744
01:13:06,612 --> 01:13:08,739
To bring all of your
daughter back...

745
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,908
I'm going to have to
go to where it lives.

746
01:13:16,122 --> 01:13:18,541
You can record everything?
Even in the dark?

747
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:19,708
Yeah. Of course.

748
01:13:20,084 --> 01:13:22,711
Whatever you need, I'm
the technical part of the team.

749
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:24,755
Then you better get set up.

750
01:13:26,298 --> 01:13:27,550
What's your contribution?

751
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:30,218
This should be good.

752
01:13:30,219 --> 01:13:31,387
It's not good. It's great.

753
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:32,721
It's our blog.

754
01:13:33,389 --> 01:13:35,099
I'm the writer of it.

755
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:39,103
Okay then, you write down everything
I describe when I'm under.

756
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:43,941
If you can keep up, that is.

757
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:49,780
Now, I'm going
into another plane.

758
01:13:49,864 --> 01:13:54,118
...into another plane...

759
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,328
Stay strong.

760
01:13:56,996 --> 01:13:58,998
No matter what happens...

761
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:00,708
No matter what you see...

762
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:03,085
...no matter what...

763
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:07,965
Okay, could you just, maybe,
write it down and try not to talk?

764
01:14:08,716 --> 01:14:10,342
Oh. Yeah...

765
01:14:13,304 --> 01:14:17,349
Sorry, does this other
plane have a name?

766
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:23,647
Let's call it, "<i>The Further</i>".

767
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:25,524
Cool name.

768
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:28,569
Now, we're going
to be quiet.

769
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:35,659
Into the Further...

770
01:14:36,952 --> 01:14:38,120
we go.

771
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:45,211
I'm here. It's dark.

772
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,550
I'm entering the hallway.

773
01:15:00,392 --> 01:15:02,436
You lived in this
building too.

774
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:04,814
He made you kill
yourself, didn't you?

775
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:06,147
Where is he?

776
01:15:13,948 --> 01:15:15,574
We're going upstairs.

777
01:15:40,224 --> 01:15:42,476
His voice was always so mad.

778
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:47,690
I was his pet.

779
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:49,108
He's got a new pet.

780
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:50,650
The girl.

781
01:15:51,402 --> 01:15:53,237
Quinn, is his new pet.

782
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,447
There's no way to it.

783
01:15:54,905 --> 01:15:57,241
You can't even kill yourself
to get away from him.

784
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:01,454
It's okay. You're free now.

785
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:11,714
I hear...

786
01:16:14,592 --> 01:16:16,010
Breathing.

787
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:32,693
I hear it.

788
01:16:52,588 --> 01:16:54,006
Turn around.

789
01:17:07,019 --> 01:17:08,687
<i>You're stronger than her.</i>

790
01:17:08,813 --> 01:17:09,855
<i>You're alive.</i>

791
01:17:11,524 --> 01:17:12,691
This is how you die.

792
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:15,778
Not today, it isn't.

793
01:17:26,872 --> 01:17:28,624
Come on, bitch.

794
01:17:45,808 --> 01:17:47,101
Let her go.

795
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:49,979
Do you hear me?
Release the girl.

796
01:17:57,862 --> 01:17:59,196
Jack.

797
01:17:59,864 --> 01:18:01,282
Hi, Eli.

798
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:03,367
Come.

799
01:18:04,201 --> 01:18:05,578
Sit here with me.

800
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:06,954
What are you
doing here?

801
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:10,040
I could feel
you were here.

802
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:13,669
I had to find you.

803
01:18:13,794 --> 01:18:16,088
I've missed you so much!

804
01:18:17,089 --> 01:18:19,008
I know.

805
01:18:19,133 --> 01:18:21,010
I know.

806
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:31,645
How? How am I
supposed to move on?

807
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,899
I never even got
to say goodbye.

808
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:38,194
Well maybe you
can move on.

809
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:42,406
I can't exist anywhere
without you.

810
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:46,744
So, I wanted to ask
you to join me here.

811
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:49,747
You'd have to leave
your other world behind.

812
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:53,542
Stop breathing, like I did.

813
01:18:55,544 --> 01:18:56,879
Stay with me here.

814
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:00,966
You'll have to
do it yourself.

815
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,678
I can't help you.

816
01:19:12,311 --> 01:19:14,230
Don't you want
to be with me?

817
01:19:16,023 --> 01:19:17,023
Want.

818
01:19:18,442 --> 01:19:20,653
Want is not a
strong enough word.

819
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:25,241
I know my...

820
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,244
turn to cross over will come.

821
01:19:30,246 --> 01:19:31,288
But I know...

822
01:19:31,414 --> 01:19:34,542
That my Jack would
never ask me to do this.

823
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:35,876
Demon.

824
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:45,344
Give me the girl now or
I'll do a whole lot worse.

825
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:02,153
Give her back.

826
01:20:28,763 --> 01:20:30,890
You may have half of her.

827
01:20:31,682 --> 01:20:33,350
But I am whole.

828
01:20:33,476 --> 01:20:36,061
And I am very strong.

829
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:18,395
Elise, wake up.

830
01:21:18,521 --> 01:21:19,521
Elise.

831
01:21:19,814 --> 01:21:21,023
Elise...

832
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,194
This way.

833
01:22:21,792 --> 01:22:22,376
Quinn.

834
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:23,711
- Honey?
- Quinn.

835
01:22:23,794 --> 01:22:24,794
Honey, please.

836
01:22:25,254 --> 01:22:26,494
What's happening to her?

837
01:22:26,505 --> 01:22:27,505
It's got her.

838
01:22:31,969 --> 01:22:32,678
Wake up.

839
01:22:32,762 --> 01:22:34,180
Don't let it take you.

840
01:22:34,305 --> 01:22:35,347
Grab her hands.

841
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,934
Quinn, don't leave.

842
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:40,686
Don't leave.

843
01:22:42,605 --> 01:22:43,814
Stay with us.

844
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:47,526
This world is your
home. Not that one.

845
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:48,610
This one.

846
01:22:56,452 --> 01:22:57,761
What's happening,
is she dying?

847
01:22:57,787 --> 01:22:59,622
- Just hold on to her.
- Is she?

848
01:22:59,705 --> 01:23:00,289
Yes.

849
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:02,124
No, bring her back.

850
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:04,543
Bring her back! You said
you can bring her back.

851
01:23:04,627 --> 01:23:05,627
You need to help me.

852
01:23:05,628 --> 01:23:06,754
Quinn.
Quinn.

853
01:23:06,837 --> 01:23:08,589
Quinn. Quinn, hear us.

854
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,965
Come back to us.

855
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:11,049
Quinn.

856
01:23:17,006 --> 01:23:18,006
What are you doing?

857
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:20,392
There's another woman
here who died.

858
01:23:20,518 --> 01:23:22,394
In this building,
a few days ago.

859
01:23:22,478 --> 01:23:23,145
Yeah, Grace.

860
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,605
Grace, the neighbor's wife.

861
01:23:24,688 --> 01:23:26,065
She's saying
something to me.

862
01:23:26,148 --> 01:23:28,943
I can't hear her. Exactly
what is she saying?

863
01:23:29,026 --> 01:23:30,403
- Honey, please.
- What book?

864
01:23:30,528 --> 01:23:32,154
Grace, what book?

865
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:32,738
Hurry.

866
01:23:32,863 --> 01:23:33,863
Elise, hurry.

867
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:36,742
Quinn's diary.

868
01:23:39,286 --> 01:23:40,037
This is it.

869
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:42,748
"Quinn, I wanted you to read
this the day you graduated."

870
01:23:42,832 --> 01:23:45,459
This is the letter that
Lily hid from Quinn.

871
01:23:45,543 --> 01:23:48,254
She wanted her to find
it on her graduation day.

872
01:23:48,337 --> 01:23:49,880
She tried to get
her to read it early.

873
01:23:49,964 --> 01:23:51,632
She was trying to
reach Quinn.

874
01:23:52,383 --> 01:23:52,842
Quinn.

875
01:23:52,967 --> 01:23:55,677
Lily, I know you were
trying to reach her.

876
01:23:55,678 --> 01:23:58,180
We know that you wanted
her to read this letter.

877
01:23:58,264 --> 01:24:00,474
Lily, we need you now.

878
01:24:01,434 --> 01:24:02,768
Help us.

879
01:25:02,703 --> 01:25:03,703
Dad.

880
01:25:12,254 --> 01:25:13,254
Thank you.

881
01:25:13,547 --> 01:25:15,049
We had some help.

882
01:25:17,301 --> 01:25:18,301
Who?

883
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:21,263
Someone else is
here with us.

884
01:25:25,226 --> 01:25:28,062
Someone who really
wants to talk to you.

885
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:31,357
Mom.

886
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:41,367
I need to know
that this is real.

887
01:25:41,992 --> 01:25:42,992
I know.

888
01:25:46,956 --> 01:25:49,542
She's saying something
about a stage.

889
01:25:50,084 --> 01:25:51,085
An audition.

890
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:55,339
She says that when you were on stage
you wanted to know if she was there.

891
01:25:59,009 --> 01:26:00,428
She was there.

892
01:26:04,473 --> 01:26:06,851
And she was
so proud of you.

893
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:15,234
She wants you,
and you, Sean...

894
01:26:15,317 --> 01:26:17,895
To know that you don't
need to look for her anymore.

895
01:26:20,281 --> 01:26:21,741
Because she'll
always be with you.

896
01:26:22,533 --> 01:26:23,868
No matter what...

897
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:26,829
She's gonna be
standing right beside you.

898
01:26:27,663 --> 01:26:29,957
Even though you can't
see her, she's there.

899
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:32,918
And anytime you're feeling...

900
01:26:33,919 --> 01:26:37,089
Confused, or alone...

901
01:26:38,382 --> 01:26:40,468
She's gonna be
whispering in your ear.

902
01:26:46,098 --> 01:26:49,226
She's never coming
back again, is she?

903
01:26:51,729 --> 01:26:53,022
Not to this world.

904
01:27:10,623 --> 01:27:11,624
I love you.

905
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,922
Good job, boys.

906
01:27:47,159 --> 01:27:48,159
Careful.

907
01:27:52,373 --> 01:27:53,373
Thanks.

908
01:27:58,045 --> 01:27:59,630
Was that the first time
you've seen a ghost?

909
01:28:00,131 --> 01:28:01,882
- Yeah.
- Yes.

910
01:28:02,466 --> 01:28:04,218
You never
get used to it.

911
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:07,513
<i>Spectral Sightings.</i>

912
01:28:07,596 --> 01:28:09,723
- I like that.
- That one's mine.

913
01:28:10,266 --> 01:28:11,851
- Is it?
- Stop.

914
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,103
You boys
fight too much.

915
01:28:14,145 --> 01:28:17,189
It's unnecessary. It's clear
you both need each other.

916
01:28:19,817 --> 01:28:22,069
Maybe we should go
into business together.

917
01:28:23,612 --> 01:28:26,240
Thought you said this business
was too dangerous for you...

918
01:28:26,323 --> 01:28:28,659
And you said,
it could kill you.

919
01:28:28,743 --> 01:28:33,122
Yeah. Well, everybody's
gonna die one day.

920
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:37,334
I think it is high
time for me...

921
01:28:37,418 --> 01:28:40,129
to get out of my house
while I'm still alive.

922
01:28:41,172 --> 01:28:42,173
What do you think?

923
01:28:43,507 --> 01:28:46,260
- Yes?
- Sure.

924
01:28:46,343 --> 01:28:48,846
Well then, take
me to my car.

925
01:28:51,724 --> 01:28:52,516
That's great.

926
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:56,353
I also think, that you guys should
think about wearing something

927
01:28:56,437 --> 01:28:58,272
a little better if we're
gonna be working together.

928
01:28:59,148 --> 01:29:01,275
I'll have you know this
Tee's extremely rare.

929
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,651
Oh, I'm sure it is.

930
01:29:02,735 --> 01:29:04,070
So you should apologize.

931
01:29:04,153 --> 01:29:05,488
I apologize.

932
01:29:05,613 --> 01:29:08,199
What would you
have us wear instead?

933
01:29:09,575 --> 01:29:11,368
Shirt and tie
might be nice.

934
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:13,996
Ain't gonna happen.

935
01:29:18,626 --> 01:29:21,337
Warren, you old dog.

936
01:29:22,004 --> 01:29:23,881
Thank you for
looking after me.

937
01:29:34,058 --> 01:29:35,309
Where is the...?

938
01:29:50,866 --> 01:29:52,576
I love you too, Jack.
