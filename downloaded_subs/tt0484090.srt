1
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,700
Seoul, South Korea.

2
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Happy Birthday!

3
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,100
Surprise!

4
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Happy Birthday to you!

5
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Happy Birthday to you!

6
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday!

7
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Happy Birthday to you!

8
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,100
What are you playing?

9
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,200
You scared me off.

10
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,038
Was it fun to fool me?

11
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,500
Vee, here you go.

12
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,300
Thank you.

13
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,115
Vee.

14
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,230
Vee is not even fat.

15
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,110
It isn't that. He has diabetes.

16
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,037
It's ok. Just a little bit.

17
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,700
Small bite. Ok?

18
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,150
Lucky.

19
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,900
You always keep things by yourself.

20
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,000
You should let it out of your chest sometimes.

21
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,071
This card says...

22
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,113
something that you lost will come back.

23
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,117
Was there something you lost...

24
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,156
it probably will return.

25
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,155
No.

26
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,997
Perhaps...

27
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,153
it may not be a thing,

28
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,199
Have you ever broke your promise with someone?

29
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,196
He's gonna take it back.

30
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,110
Don't listen to Ji-Ho so much.

31
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,078
She told me that I'll meet my soul mate.

32
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,118
But I'm still single until now.

33
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,100
Then stop being so picky.

34
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,109
I'm not pretty like you...

35
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,156
to get a good-looking guy like Vee.

36
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,995
Injection time.

37
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,070
Still scared of injection?

38
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,500
Won't take long.

39
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
All done.

40
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,150
I'll be back.

41
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Ok.

42
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,035
Hello.

43
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,992
Hold on please.

44
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,995
Pim, it's your call.

45
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,035
Pim.

46
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,000
Is it an urgent matter?

47
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,189
She's not here.

48
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,989
Pardon?

49
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,150
What is it?

50
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,075
Pim.

51
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,236
The hospital in Thailand called...

52
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,031
Your mom had a stroke.

53
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
Go back now?

54
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,229
If I hadn't come here,

55
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,150
it wouldn't have happened.

56
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,077
Are you ok, Pim?

57
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,076
I don't want to go back there.

58
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,076
Since Ploy died,

59
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,196
I don't want to live in that house anymore.

60
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,159
Am I selfish for leaving
everything behind?

61
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,036
Don't say that!

62
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,078
If I hadn't wanted the operation,

63
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,156
maybe Ploy wouldn't have died.

64
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,994
Pim. We already talked, didn't we?

65
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,993
It's not your fault!

66
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,196
No one wants it to be this way.

67
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,900
The patient is now unable to move...

68
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,076
and also unable to talk.

69
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,199
because of the brain hemorrhage
affected the nerve's end.

70
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,038
we have to wait until
her condition gets better.

71
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,500
Then we can operate.

72
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,233
Mom.

73
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,030
Mom!

74
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,155
Excuse me, miss.

75
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,192
I think you should let her sleep.

76
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,071
Please go outside.

77
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Oh! Pim.

78
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,031
That is Ploy's favorite song.

79
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,151
Ploy...

80
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,110
Miss Pim.

81
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,117
If you don't need me...

82
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,037
could I go home?

83
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,116
You didn't sleep here?

84
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,235
No, miss.

85
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,076
You can sleep here if you'd like

86
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,189
It's more convenient.

87
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,109
It's ok.

88
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,071
I'd better go home.

89
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,111
Vee! Vee!

90
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,189
What?

91
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,193
What's going on?

92
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,995
Vee!

93
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,069
Are you ok?

94
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,992
You're alright?

95
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,149
Mom.

96
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,075
How do you feel?

97
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,500
What is it, mom?

98
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,000
What did you say?

99
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,155
Excuse me, miss.

100
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,191
I'll give her a shot.

101
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,995
Noi.

102
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,116
What happened to mom on that day?

103
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,077
How did she collaspe?

104
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,156
I really don't know.

105
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,229
Since you've been here...

106
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,075
how is she so far?

107
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,115
Noi.

108
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,149
I...

109
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,157
I don't know what happened to her lately.

110
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,112
She always stayed in her room...

111
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,111
kept crying.

112
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,117
Sometimes I felt like...

113
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,159
she was afraid of something.

114
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What was she afraid of?

115
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,118
How is mother's condition, doctor?

116
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,152
She's suddenly getting worse.

117
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,112
I think we have to operate her tonight.

118
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,196
Miss! Miss!

119
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,071
Are you ok?

120
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,075
Pim.

121
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,115
Are you tired?

122
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,111
You can go home if you'd like.

123
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,156
I'll stay here.

124
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,109
I'm ok.

125
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,033
Your mother is safe now.

126
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,031
She's still unconscious.

127
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,071
So when will she wake up?

128
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,156
I can't answer that.

129
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,118
It depends on the patient's condition.

130
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,077
Lucky.

131
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,035
Lucky.

132
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,189
Lucky.

133
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,149
Lucky.

134
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,995
Lucky.

135
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,195
Lucky.

136
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,077
Lucky.

137
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,035
Lucky.

138
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,996
Lucky.

139
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,149
What's the matter?

140
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,035
Pim!

141
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,031
Pim! Open the door!

142
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,030
Pim!

143
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,071
Pim!

144
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,115
What's going on, Pim?

145
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,037
What happened?

146
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,075
It's done.

147
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,110
Pim.

148
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,235
What exactly happened to you?

149
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,234
Why did you hurt yourself?

150
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,233
Pim.

151
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,156
Why don't you tell me?

152
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,111
I see Ploy.

153
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,115
What do you mean?

154
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,072
I feel like she's still
near me all the time.

155
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,992
I don't understand.

156
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,071
How can you see her?

157
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,031
Ploy was dead.

158
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,115
Never mind.

159
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,195
I'm just anxious.

160
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,155
Pim.

161
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,110
You'd better go to the doctor.

162
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,109
Vee...

163
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,229
I'm okay.

164
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,150
How are you?

165
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,990
Oh! Good.

166
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,300
Long time no see.

167
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,100
You've changed a lot.

168
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,300
Really?

169
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,150
Coffee.

170
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,000
Thanks.

171
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,109
Ah! Pim.

172
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,156
This is Danai, my senior.

173
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,110
Hello.

174
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,155
Hello.

175
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,039
We're very closed before I moved to Korea.

176
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,031
We haven't met more than ten years right?

177
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,116
Yup. More than 10 years.

178
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,031
It's been a long time.

179
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,189
How come you guys meet again?

180
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,118
Vee called me to visit this house.

181
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,156
How's your job so far?

182
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,112
Well, quite busy. I give a lecture...

183
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,116
and also have a lot patients.

184
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,151
So what are your specialized?

185
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,152
I am a psychaitrist.

186
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,115
Pim!

187
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,031
Pim!

188
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,229
You think I'm insane?

189
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,233
Pim!

190
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,189
Listen to me!

191
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,075
Pim!

192
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,077
Open the door, Pim!

193
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,075
Pim!

194
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Lucky!

195
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,150
Lucky!

196
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,992
Pim!

197
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,038
From the scan results,

198
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,037
your brain looks normal.

199
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,199
I'll show you some pictures.

200
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,230
Just tell me...

201
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,189
what do you see.

202
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,155
Okay?

203
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,075
Batman.

204
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,112
If I answer this, it means
I'm crazy, right?

205
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,198
I must say 'Butterfly', right?
That'll be normal.

206
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,152
Seeing a psychaitrist..

207
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,078
doesn't mean you're crazy.

208
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,112
Anyone can be like you.

209
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,076
It can be cured.

210
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,230
Vee's so worried about you.

211
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,190
He doesn't want to see you like this.

212
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,157
Can you tell me about Ploy?

213
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,037
We used to promise to live
with each other forever.

214
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,072
Then what made you seperate?

215
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,118
Alright, let's call for today.

216
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,195
I'll give you medicine.

217
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,189
It's no use, doctor.

218
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,073
You can't help me.

219
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,234
Apparently she is  mentally ill.

220
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,116
This's kind of sickness...

221
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,113
You can't tell between illusion and reality.

222
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,000
Plus the guilty from the past...

223
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,234
makes her see an illusion.

224
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,155
It can be cured?

225
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,195
Of course.

226
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,117
It can be cured.

227
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,197
You just take her back to korea.
She must be better.

228
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,073
We have to be here longer. I guess.

229
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,220
I don't know when her mom's gonna recover.

230
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,994
Then take her to a new place to relax.

231
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,155
That'll be good.

232
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,159
Go ahead! These are your favorite.

233
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,997
Eat a lot!

234
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,157
Here...delicious?

235
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,189
It looks yummy!

236
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,191
Try this!

237
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,029
Pim!

238
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,195
Pim!

239
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,996
Pim!

240
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,995
What's wrong?

241
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,029
Pim!

242
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,109
Pim!

243
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,109
Pim!

244
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,117
Pim!

245
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,997
What should I do?

246
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,195
She followed me.

247
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,151
Pim doesn't get any better.

248
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,150
I have to take her back as soon as I can.

249
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,038
It's probably a good idea.

250
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,195
You know...

251
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,116
it's not that I'm credulous.

252
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,991
Have you ever heard...

253
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,231
the story about the twins?

254
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,229
If one of them dies,

255
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,069
another one will die too.

256
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,111
Pim told me that

257
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,236
Ploy's gonna take her life.

258
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,190
It's just a belief, man.

259
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,073
It's possible that twins' mind
are linked.

260
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,991
But I think...

261
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,190
it's just a binding of...

262
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,118
the living that yearns for the dead.

263
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,997
Vee.

264
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,195
What's wrong?

265
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,115
Nothing.

266
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,156
I think you went to the hospital.

267
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,116
Just stop by to bring you something to eat.

268
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,071
Go down to eat.

269
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,116
As for her condition,

270
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,151
I'm totally disagree about taking her to Korea.

271
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,151
It's risky.

272
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,074
We should observe her condition for a while.

273
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,998
Thank you.

274
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,071
Well then, excuse me.

275
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,155
Yes.

276
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,995
Mother.

277
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,992
What is it mother?

278
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,200
Pim!

279
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,030
Vee!

280
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Vee! I'm scared.

281
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,149
I saw her again.

282
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,038
How can I make her disappear?

283
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,038
How can I make her disappear?

284
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,991
Miss Pim.

285
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,198
It's just your own imagination.

286
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,038
Like we talk about 'Mickey Mouse'...

287
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,113
we imagine about it but we don't really see it.

288
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,196
If our brain is malfunction,

289
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,231
the imagination in our mind...

290
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,149
will become...

291
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,118
as if it is real.

292
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,031
You still see your twin...

293
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,992
because your mind's still clinging on her.

294
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,992
You said you saw her in the mirror, right?

295
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,109
Look at the mirror.

296
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,112
Who do you see now?

297
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,235
Pim!

298
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,109
Pim!

299
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,195
Ploy!

300
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,032
And that reason made
you both decided to seperate.

301
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:03,069
Even Chang and Eng twins still
wanted to be seperated.

302
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,998
Two persons whose their bodies
are joined together...

303
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,117
it is normally to have the conflict.

304
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,231
But we had furious fight.

305
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,116
Ploy didn't want the operation.

306
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,152
Did you ever think ploy is
unwanted thing in your life?

307
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,236
No, I never think that.

308
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:33,196
It isn't wrong that you want to have your own life.

309
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,997
But I...

310
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,229
I made her died.

311
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,076
If you stop blaming yourself,

312
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,119
you won't see shadow of your twin anymore.

313
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,189
Pim!

314
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,069
Are you ok?

315
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,992
Let's go.

316
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,075
No..

317
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,151
No..not true.

318
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,149
You bought him?

319
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,029
Lucky.

320
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,156
Lucky, come here.

321
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,193
Lucky!

322
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,231
Pim, he is not Lucky.

323
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,189
Noi!

324
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,115
Take him away.

325
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,155
Yes.

326
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,149
Oh, Pim.

327
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,031
Korean hospital already accepts.

328
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,156
We'll go back soon.

329
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,075
Pim.

330
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,071
Do you remember the painting I drew for you?

331
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,191
Ploy did it, right?

332
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,031
Don't Ploy!

333
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,039
Please Ploy!

334
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,199
It's because of me, right?
That made you two seperated.

335
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,151
I hate you!

336
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,076
Let's get disjoined operation.

337
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,229
Why didn't you tell me?

338
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,031
How can I tell you?

339
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,072
Tell you that I chose you
and let Ploy died?

340
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,235
Ploy...don't!

341
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,193
Mom!

342
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,991
You know? Vee.

343
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,196
Ploy loved you all along.

344
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,069
I believe that you really saw her.

345
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:32,074
But medically, we can't say that
the thing you saw is really exist.

346
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,999
Human brain is very complex.

347
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,116
The thing that you saw...

348
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,116
is just an illusion.

349
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,037
- An illusion!
- Stop, doctor.

350
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,500
stop! How many time I tell you
she's still here.

351
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,900
She's not dead.

352
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,233
Miss Pim!

353
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,071
Where is Pim?

354
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,038
She wasn't be with you?

355
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,030
Pim.

356
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,115
Vee!

357
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,189
Vee! Help me!

358
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,115
Pim!

359
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,075
Pim!

360
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:51,233
Pim!

361
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,195
Pim!

362
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,035
Pim!

363
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,116
What's wrong, Pim?
It's me.

364
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,195
Vee.

365
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,079
It's all right.
Let's go back to Korea.

366
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,149
Let's go to the hospital.

367
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,075
Vee!

368
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,031
Don't worry, Pim.

369
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,195
I'll move your mother tonight.

370
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,195
Vee.

371
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,238
Vee.

372
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,991
Where is doctor?

373
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,109
Can I help you?

374
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,111
I want to transfer the patient right now?

375
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,037
Please calm down sir.

376
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,069
Find the doctor for me.

377
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,076
Ok. I will find him.

378
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,500
What is it, mother?

379
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,116
Please take a good look.

380
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,112
Who do you see now?

381
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,073
In the mirror, I see Ploy in there.

382
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,400
<i>Pim</i>

383
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,155
You know, Vee?

384
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,189
Ploy loved you all along.

385
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,149
Vee.

386
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,037
Mom has passed away.

387
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,197
What did you do?
Why you get soaked?

388
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,035
How did she die?

389
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,110
The patient's condition is getting better.

390
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,033
About moving to Korea...

391
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,072
tell them to contact us.

392
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,191
I don't know either.

393
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,038
I never thought that she's
getting worse that fast.

394
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,199
Luckily, she talked to me before she died.

395
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,069
Why?

396
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,191
Afraid what she'll tell me?

397
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,195
This is yours, right?

398
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,991
Are you surprised?

399
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,195
Ploy.

400
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,037
What did you say, Vee?

401
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,031
Stop lying to me!

402
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,117
I went to the temple today.
What exactly happened to Pim?

403
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,031
How did she die? Tell me.

404
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,035
Let go!

405
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,116
Ploy's dead, Vee!

406
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,992
Ploy. Why you did that?

407
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,039
No...I'm Pim.

408
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,076
I'm Pim.

409
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,071
What happened to Pim?

410
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,031
Or you..

411
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,117
What did you do to her?

412
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,038
We can't live like this.

413
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,149
Let's apart.

414
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:50,075
No. I'll be with you until I die.

415
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,152
Why did you do that?

416
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,232
You know, you are unwanted.

417
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,190
No, I'm not!

418
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,235
No..No..

419
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,155
Let go, Ploy!

420
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,077
Pim!

421
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,029
Pim!

422
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,990
Pim!

423
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,189
Pim!

424
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,189
Mom!

425
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,149
Mom!

426
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,229
Pim!

427
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,079
Mom! Help me!

428
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,035
Mom!

429
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,195
Pim!

430
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,076
I did't mean it.

431
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,116
How did you do that?

432
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,071
She is your sister!

433
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,076
You've deceived me all along.

434
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,300
But why, Vee!

435
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:28,073
Pim and I are exactly the same.

436
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,076
Why can't you love me?

437
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,111
You're so pathetic!

438
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,038
What about time we've spent together?

439
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,071
There's no meaning to you?

440
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,192
Is it me that you love?

441
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,997
It's not yours.

442
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,031
Vee!

443
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:26,991
[Lagu diputar]

444
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:36,079
[Lagu diputar]

445
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:08,154
I never thought this day will come.

446
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,991
Everyone loves only Pim.

447
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,234
After she died,

448
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,038
mom never talked to me again.

449
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:40,109
She treated me like disgusting thing.

450
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,998
I love you not less than Pim.

451
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,150
But you only have your eyes on her.

452
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,033
The letters that you wrote to her..

453
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,197
I pretended that they're for me.

454
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,195
The only way to make you love me...

455
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,116
is to become Pim.

456
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,190
all the letters that you received...

457
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,196
I wrote them all.

458
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,300
How could you say you love Pim?

459
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,000
It's me that you love!

460
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,196
Poor Pim.

461
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,239
I'm the one who get your love.

462
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,156
Is it hurt?

463
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,229
Just a second.

464
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,077
You hate it so much, right?

465
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,078
Why can't it replace the old one?

466
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,037
Why?

467
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,190
Even though it's all the same.

468
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,037
I'm sorry.

469
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,032
I forget my cell phone.

470
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,000
Where is it? I'll get it for you.

471
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,155
I'm not sure. Maybe in the kitchen.

472
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:37,900
Vee!

473
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,189
Where are you?

474
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,300
Come out now!

475
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,117
Or I'll burn you.

476
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,037
Come out!

477
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,300
Let me out!

478
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:13,200
<i>Ploy and Pim</i>
