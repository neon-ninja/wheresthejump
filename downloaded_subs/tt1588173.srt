1
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,529
What am I doing with my life?

2
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,698
I'm so pale. I should get out more.

3
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,032
I should eat better.

4
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:36,160
My posture is terrible.
I should stand up straighter.

5
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,247
People would respect me more
if I stood up straighter.

6
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,457
What's wrong with me?
I just want to connect.

7
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,001
Why can't I connect with people?

8
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,754
Oh, right. It's because I'm dead.

9
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,049
I shouldn't be so hard on myself.
I mean, we're all dead.

10
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,802
This girl is dead. That guy's dead.

11
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,637
That guy in the corner is definitely dead.

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,055
Jesus, these guys look awful.

13
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,062
I wish I could introduce myself,

14
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,106
but I don't remember my name anymore.

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,651
I mean, I think it started with an "R,"
but that's all I have left.

16
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,280
I can't remember my name,
or my parents, or my job.

17
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,824
Although my hoodie would suggest
I was unemployed.

18
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,012
Sometimes I look at the others
and try to imagine what they were.

19
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,206
You were a janitor.

20
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,839
You were the rich son of a corporate CEO.

21
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,763
You were a personal trainer.

22
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,019
And now you're a Corpse.

23
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,940
I have a hard time piecing together
how this whole apocalypse thing happened.

24
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,485
Could have been chemical warfare
or an airborne virus,

25
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,361
or a radioactive outbreak monkey.

26
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,115
But it doesn't really matter.
This is what we are now.

27
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,827
This is a typical day for me.

28
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,830
I shuffle around,
occasionally bumping into people,

29
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,625
unable to apologize
or say much of anything.

30
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,923
It must have been so much better before,

31
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,716
when everyone could express themselves,

32
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,843
and communicate their feelings

33
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,387
and just enjoy each other's company.

34
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,189
A lot of us have made our home
here at this airport.

35
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,524
I don't know why.

36
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,983
People wait at airports, I guess,

37
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,236
but I'm not sure what
we're all waiting for.

38
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,912
Oh, man. They call these guys Boneys.

39
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,039
They don't bother us much.

40
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,803
But they'll eat anything with a heartbeat.

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,586
I mean, I will too,
but at least I'm conflicted about it.

42
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,506
We all become them some day.

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,550
At some point you just give up, I guess.

44
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,594
You lose all hope.
After that, there's no turning back.

45
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,013
Oh, man, gross.

46
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,307
Stop. Stop, don't pick at it!
You're making it worse!

47
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,602
Oh, this is what I have to look forward to.

48
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,438
It's kind of a bummer.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,192
I don't want to be this way.

50
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,111
I'm lonely. I'm lost.

51
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,735
I mean, I'm literally lost.

52
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
I've never been in this part
of the airport before.

53
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,951
Wonder if these guys are lost, too.

54
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,663
Wandering around,
but never getting anywhere.

55
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,291
Do they feel trapped?
Do they want more than this?

56
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,461
Am I the only one?

57
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,877
This is my best friend.

58
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,308
By best friend, I mean
we occasionally grunt

59
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,468
and stare awkwardly at each other.

60
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,391
We even have
almost-conversations sometimes.

61
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,033
Days pass this way.

62
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,501
But sometimes we even find
actual words. Words like...

63
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,003
Hungry.

64
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,255
And...

65
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,340
City.

66
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,435
Even though we can't communicate,

67
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,687
we do share a similar taste in food.

68
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,731
Traveling in packs just
kind of makes sense,

69
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,357
especially when everyone
and their grandmother

70
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,818
is trying to shoot you in the head
all the time.

71
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,575
God, we move slow.

72
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,663
This could take a while.

73
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,713
Hello, and thank you for
your service today.

74
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,050
In the eight years since
this plague destroyed our world...

75
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,927
You think we're getting
this stuff for the cure?

76
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,845
Since we erected this wall...

77
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,764
No one believes in a cure anymore, Jules.

78
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,183
We have counted on
young volunteers like you

79
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,685
to gather resources from beyond the wall.

80
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,772
But first, a word of caution.

81
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,982
Corpses look human, they are not.

82
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,318
They do not think. They do not bleed.

83
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,529
Whether they were your mother
or your best friend,

84
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,280
they are beyond your help.

85
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,535
They are uncaring, unfeeling,
incapable of remorse.

86
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,620
Sound like anyone you know, Dad?

87
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,831
Just picture them as this.

88
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,669
As sons and daughters of
possibly the sole remaining

89
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,379
human settlement on Earth,

90
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,131
you are a critical part

91
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,217
of what stands between us and extinction.

92
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,596
Therefore you have an obligation
to return to us safely.

93
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,683
And if you remember your
training, you will.

94
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,895
Good luck, Godspeed,
and God bless America.

95
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,273
USA! USA!

96
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,399
Let's go.

97
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,669
Sweet.

98
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,379
Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?

99
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,005
No dice. Almost at level five.

100
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,510
Did you hear that?

101
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,555
I did. We should bail.

102
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,141
Oh, hey, we can't just bail.
We have orders.

103
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,894
Do you have any idea how much medicine
the City goes through a month?

104
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,604
We need pharma salvage to survive.

105
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,107
- We can't just abandon our...
- You sound just like my dad.

106
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,317
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it wasn't a compliment.

107
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,445
Oh, here, guys. Take some Prozac.

108
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,697
Maybe that will cheer you up.

109
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,702
I told you I heard something.

110
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,581
Per, let's bail.

111
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,212
Perry?

112
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,506
We have orders, Jules.

113
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,717
It was nothing anyway.

114
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,781
- You're being paranoid, okay?
- Perry!

115
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,645
Aim for their heads!

116
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,943
Smile, mother...

117
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,119
Nice watch.

118
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,375
Now, I'm not proud of this.

119
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,542
In fact, I'd appreciate it

120
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,711
if you might look away for a moment here.

121
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,799
I don't like hurting people,
but this is the world now.

122
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,135
The new hunger is a very powerful thing.

123
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,141
If I don't eat all of him,
if I spare his brain,

124
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,560
he'll rise up and become a Corpse like me.

125
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,855
But if I do, I get his memories,

126
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,899
his thoughts, his feelings.

127
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,072
I'm sorry, I just can't help it.

128
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,323
The brain's the best part.

129
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,659
The part that makes me feel human again.

130
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,166
You like it, Perry?

131
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,420
I don't want to hurt you.

132
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,256
I just want to feel what you felt.

133
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,431
To feel a little better.

134
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,058
A little less dead.

135
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,037
Perry... I think I love you.

136
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,960
Say something.

137
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,088
Don't just say nothing.

138
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,214
No, I...

139
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,426
I think I love you too, Julie.

140
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,147
I miss airplanes.

141
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,733
My mom used to say that it looked like

142
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
an Etch A Sketch up there.

143
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,164
I like that you remember
that kind of stuff.

144
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,368
If we don't, then it will just all be gone.
You know?

145
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,496
Yeah.

146
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,332
The world is so messed up.

147
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,375
Not all of it.

148
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,003
Cheeseball.

149
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,178
Perry?

150
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,806
Perry!

151
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,810
Perry, where are you? Answer me!

152
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:56,898
Julie...

153
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,245
Safe.

154
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,000
Come...

155
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,460
What?

156
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,735
I don't know what I'm doing.
What's wrong with me?

157
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,991
These other guys
would never bring a living person home.

158
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,744
You know why? Because that's crazy!

159
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,122
Right now, they think
she's just another one of us.

160
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,499
A new addition to the family.

161
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,293
But they would think I was insane.

162
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,419
If they could think.

163
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,589
Why do I have to be so weird?

164
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,966
What am I doing?

165
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,464
Home...

166
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,677
Not eat.

167
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,273
Keep you safe.

168
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,892
All right.

169
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,228
Maybe I could have
thought this through a little more.

170
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,772
But I can tell when a girl needs her space.

171
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,200
There's a lot of ways
to get to know a person.

172
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,277
Eating her dead boyfriend's brains

173
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,446
is one of the more
unorthodox methods, but...

174
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,251
It's a special occasion.

175
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:30,961
A special occasion, sir?

176
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,171
It's Mom's birthday.

177
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,260
- To Diane.
- To Mom.

178
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,344
Yeah.

179
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,179
- It's Mom's birthday.
- So, Perry,

180
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,182
Julie tells me
you've been working in Agriculture.

181
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,249
But tell me you would never consider

182
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,478
going to work construction
with your father.

183
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,689
You know, on the wall we need good people.

184
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,026
Don't mind him, Per.
Dad's idea of saving humanity

185
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,904
is to build a really big concrete box,
put everyone in it,

186
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,782
and then wait at the door with guns
until we grow old and die.

187
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,204
Well, Julie, without the wall,
we would be eating brains now

188
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,914
- instead of rice.
- Dad...

189
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,710
This is the only way past the wall.

190
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,295
Otherwise we get stopped.

191
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,548
Okay...

192
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,306
Come on. It's not that bad. Come on.

193
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,903
I haven't heard from him
in two days, Jules.

194
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,563
He's on construction detail, Perry.
He's working.

195
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,982
My dad goes weeks without checking in.

196
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,157
Okay. This way.

197
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,493
Hey.

198
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,330
It's gonna be okay.

199
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,318
Dad.

200
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,035
Per.

201
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,208
Hey, hey, hey!

202
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,889
Perry! Come on!

203
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,395
No wonder she's so afraid of me.

204
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,690
I need a different approach.

205
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,985
Okay, here we go. Don't be creepy.

206
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,070
Don't be creepy. Don't be creepy.

207
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,088
What are you doing?

208
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,760
Please leave me alone.

209
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,234
Why me?

210
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,280
Why did you save me?

211
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,073
Don't

212
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,786
cry.

213
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:23,985
Safe.

214
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,322
Keep you safe.

215
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,337
What are you?

216
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,990
I'm hungry.

217
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,828
Just let me go!

218
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,581
Not safe.

219
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,957
Not safe?

220
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,752
Not safe.

221
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,632
Well, then you're just gonna have to
go and get me some food.

222
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,634
Because I'm starved.

223
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,932
Please?

224
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,311
I'd be very grateful for some food.

225
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,814
Okay.

226
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,366
God!

227
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,288
Shit.

228
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,640
Don't run.

229
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,284
Come. Safe.

230
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,536
Thank you.

231
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,090
Be dead.

232
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,888
Okay?

233
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,690
That's too much.

234
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:47,915
Told you not safe.

235
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,418
Yeah, I get that.

236
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,464
I really am hungry, though.

237
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,508
Yes!

238
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,098
My God.

239
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,609
Oh, no. Stop staring.
You're acting weird again.

240
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,844
Thank you.

241
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,180
Oh, my God.

242
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,190
Oh, man.

243
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,026
I can't remember the
last time I had a beer.

244
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,363
I guess you can't be
all that bad, Mr. Zombie.

245
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,993
My name...

246
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,955
You have a name?

247
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,249
What is your name?

248
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,087
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

249
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,797
Rrrr?

250
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,632
This date is not going well.

251
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,883
I want to die all over again.

252
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,552
Rrrrrrr...

253
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,303
Does your name start with "R"?

254
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,184
Robert? Richard?

255
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,854
Randy?

256
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,898
Raphael? Ricardo?

257
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,278
Why don't I just call you "R"?

258
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,690
I mean, that's a start, right?

259
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,076
R...

260
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,704
I want to go home, R.

261
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,919
It's not safe.

262
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,045
I get that.

263
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,882
And look...

264
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,593
I know that you saved my life.

265
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,428
And I'm grateful for that.

266
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,889
But you walked me into this place.

267
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,266
So I know that you can walk me out again.

268
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,643
Oh, no. She can't leave. She just got here.

269
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,022
Tell her she has to wait.
Tell her they'll notice.

270
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,984
Have to wait.

271
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,072
They... They'll notice.

272
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,408
Not bad.

273
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,743
How long?

274
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,412
Few days.

275
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,959
They'll forget.

276
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,422
You'll be okay.

277
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,551
Are there others like you?

278
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,597
I mean, I've...

279
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,558
I've never ever heard a Corpse talk before.

280
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,562
I mean, apart from the groaning.

281
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,657
Okay. A few days?

282
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,664
What am I supposed to do
for a few days around here anyway?

283
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,712
This is awesome!

284
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,357
You wanna try?

285
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:51,826
Oh, God!

286
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:54,745
You're a leadfoot.

287
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,583
Okay. Okay. Pick a foot.

288
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,335
You're using two feet. Pick one foot...

289
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,006
There you go. Okay...

290
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,176
There you go.

291
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,353
All right. Two hands on the wheel, buddy.

292
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,248
Jesus, R!

293
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,418
This was a beautiful car!

294
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,544
Recalculating.

295
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,399
What's with all the vinyl?

296
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,085
Couldn't figure out how to work an iPod?

297
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,238
Better sound.

298
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,824
You're a purist?

299
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,159
More

300
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,788
alive.

301
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,917
Yeah. That's true. Lot
more trouble, though.

302
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,379
There you go again. Shrugging.

303
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,798
Stop shrugging, shrugger.

304
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,008
It's a very non-committal gesture.

305
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:33,886
Really?

306
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:40,101
These are really cool records.
How did you get all these?

307
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,646
I collect things.

308
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,900
Yeah, I can see that.
You, my friend, are a hoarder.

309
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,407
Man, there's this awesome record store
on Main and lvy.

310
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,076
You would love it. It's so cool.

311
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,954
Was so cool.

312
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,874
Alrighty.

313
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,839
Much better.

314
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,100
R? Can I ask you something?

315
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:52,149
My boyfriend, he died back there.

316
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,778
Will he come back? As one of you?

317
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,117
That's good, I guess.

318
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,207
Something happened to him.

319
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,294
A lot of things happened to him.

320
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,006
But I guess there just came a point where

321
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,301
he couldn't absorb any more.

322
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,932
It's just, in my world,
people die all the time.

323
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,019
So... You know, it's not like.

324
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,939
I'm not sad that he's gone.

325
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,567
Because I am.

326
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,278
But I think I've been

327
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,283
preparing for it for a really long time.

328
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,620
What are you?

329
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:47,348
Man, it must be nice to sleep.
I wish I could.

330
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,433
I wish I could dream.

331
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,537
But that's not really an option for me.

332
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,814
The dead don't dream.
This is as close as we get.

333
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,532
You sure about this, son?

334
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,536
Welcome, then.

335
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,875
Sorry for your loss.

336
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,002
Me, too.

337
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,506
Give him one and show him how to use it.

338
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,428
Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?

339
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,055
I'm almost at level five.

340
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,724
Did you hear that?

341
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,811
I did. We should bail.

342
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,688
We can't just bail. We have orders.

343
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,274
You sound just like my dad.

344
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,568
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it wasn't a compliment.

345
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:42,945
I told you I heard something.

346
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,531
Perry!

347
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,616
Aim for their heads.

348
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:04,610
You said a few days.
It's been a few days, R.

349
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,946
I have to go home.

350
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,368
Stay together.

351
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,289
Safe.

352
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,461
What?

353
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,213
Julie.

354
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:26,840
Living.

355
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:28,801
Eat!

356
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,359
Oh, my God!

357
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,528
We go.

358
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,032
Eat.

359
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,493
R. Look.

360
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,158
This way.

361
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,677
Come with me.

362
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,430
What?

363
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,806
No!

364
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,810
Want to help her.

365
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:02,978
Who the hell asked you?

366
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,731
Like her.

367
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,778
It's okay.

368
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,281
I'm sure it is.

369
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,453
- Over there, the garage.
- Hold on.

370
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,591
I'm so happy to see you right now.

371
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,596
You okay?

372
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,144
R?

373
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,289
You drive.

374
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,207
Good idea.

375
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,695
The white zone

376
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,282
is for loading and unloading
of passengers only.

377
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,777
Jesus, I'm freezing.

378
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,947
I have to pull over.

379
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,994
This is one of the last neighborhoods
my dad evacuated.

380
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,413
Maybe these houses have food.

381
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,890
Okay, come on.

382
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,354
Oh, man. It's locked.

383
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,816
Oh, God.

384
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,011
Oh, cool!

385
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,140
Look what they have.

386
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,077
I haven't seen one of these in forever.

387
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:12,894
Cheese!

388
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:18,066
It's all right. See?

389
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:21,987
Yeah.

390
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,831
It's important to preserve memories,
you know?

391
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,201
Especially now that
the world is on its way out.

392
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,417
Everything you see,
you may be seeing for the last time.

393
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,627
Perry used to say that.

394
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,132
Here. Take a picture.

395
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,567
I'm exhausted.

396
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,822
The bed actually isn't too rotten,
so I'm gonna go to sleep.

397
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,200
Good night.

398
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,042
R?

399
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,585
Yeah?

400
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,004
I was... I was thinking...

401
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:26,927
You know, you could sleep in there
if you want.

402
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,304
On the floor.

403
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,974
These houses creep me out, so...

404
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,395
Okay.

405
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:52,130
Do you feel it?

406
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,585
Hey, look up this street.

407
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,212
Holy shit. That's my dad.

408
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,297
Get back!

409
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,932
He would have killed you.

410
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,388
If he saw you,
he would have just shot you in the head,

411
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,649
and you'd just be gone.

412
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,949
These clothes are soaking still.

413
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,703
I'm gonna lay them out to dry.

414
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,456
Oh, relax.

415
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,210
Holy shit.

416
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:54,968
Don't look.

417
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,262
Okay.

418
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,225
Holy shit!

419
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,778
Hey.

420
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,323
Do you have to eat people?

421
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:19,993
Yeah.

422
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:21,828
Or you'll die?

423
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,751
- Yeah.
- But you didn't eat me.

424
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:34,507
You rescued me. Like, a bunch.

425
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,766
It must be hard being stuck in there.

426
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,602
You know, I can see you trying.

427
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,353
Maybe that's what people do.

428
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,023
You know, we try to be better.

429
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,277
Sometimes we kind of suck at it.

430
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,406
But I look at you and

431
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:02,660
you try so much harder
than any human in my city.

432
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,166
You're a good person, R.

433
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,048
Anyway.

434
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,051
It was me.

435
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,513
What was you?

436
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,663
I mean, I...

437
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,541
I guess I kind of knew that.

438
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,251
You did?

439
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,381
Yeah, I...

440
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,883
I guess I hoped that you didn't.

441
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,471
I'm sorry.

442
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,725
Julie...

443
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,731
I'm so sorry.

444
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,942
Julie...

445
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,970
The dead do not sleep.

446
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,535
If you guys could pick
any job in the world...

447
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,872
Pretend that everything
was totally different,

448
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,957
what would you want to do?

449
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,046
- Nursing.
- Yeah?

450
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,841
Yeah. Healing people and

451
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,886
saving lives and...

452
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,598
I don't know, finding a cure.

453
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,017
I like that.

454
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:35,271
I think someday someone's gonna
figure out this whole thing and

455
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,106
exhume the whole world.

456
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,817
Exhume? And what does that mean?

457
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,696
Exhume means to, like, revive.

458
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,325
It means to dig up.
As in digging up a corpse.

459
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,577
Whatever.

460
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,081
What the hell are you doing here?

461
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,088
Are you actually dreaming right now?

462
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:01,923
I'm not sure.

463
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,593
You can't dream, Corpse.
Dreaming is for humans.

464
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:09,681
Chill out, Per. He can
dream if he wants to.

465
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,268
What about you, R?

466
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,230
What do you want to be?

467
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,984
I don't know. I don't even know what I am.

468
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,028
Well, you can be whatever you want.

469
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,238
Isn't that what they say?

470
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,366
We can, right? You and me?

471
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,869
It's not gonna happen, loverboy.

472
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,414
Not after you told her you ate her ex.

473
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,255
Shrug.

474
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,900
So much for dreaming.

475
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,777
You can't be whatever you want.

476
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,779
All I'll ever be is a slow, pale,

477
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,530
hunched-over, dead-eyed zombie.

478
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,074
What did I think was gonna happen?

479
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,798
That she'd actually want to stay with me?

480
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,120
It's hopeless.
This is what I get for wanting more.

481
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,766
I should just be happy with what I had.

482
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,583
Things don't change. I need to accept that.

483
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,585
It's easier not to feel.

484
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,253
Then I wouldn't have to feel like this.

485
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,153
Identify yourself!

486
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,446
It's just me, Kevin. It's okay. I'm fine.

487
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,698
Just stop right there.

488
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,160
It's okay. I'm not infected.

489
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,661
I said stop, Julie!

490
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,832
Okay. Fine. Fine.

491
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,042
Let me check you out.

492
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,012
- Is she okay?
- Clear, sir.

493
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,138
Hi, Dad.

494
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,682
I sent a half a dozen units
out looking for you.

495
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,766
Nora said you were taken into...

496
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,853
Yeah, I was. But I escaped.

497
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,939
I was holed up in a house in the suburbs

498
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:50,610
and then I found a car, so I came here.

499
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,321
Julie, are you sure nothing bit you?

500
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:54,906
Do I look infected to you, Dad?

501
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,824
We have to be safe.

502
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,744
Yeah, I know. I know.

503
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,913
I'm fine, though. I promise.

504
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,124
I thought I lost you.

505
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,546
Well, you didn't, Dad. I'm here.

506
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,174
Welcome home.

507
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,843
Yeah. Good to be back.

508
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,239
So I'm just gonna go home.
I'm gonna blend in.

509
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:37,907
I'm gonna stop thinking so much.

510
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,159
I'm gonna forget about her,

511
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,203
just like I forgot about everything else.

512
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,997
I'm gonna... Oh, shit, am I cold?

513
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,918
Is that what this is?
Corpses don't get cold.

514
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,336
Yo!

515
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,194
What are you doing here?

516
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:19,532
Boneys. They chased me out.

517
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,576
Came to find you.

518
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:24,453
Where is she?

519
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,289
Went home.

520
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,549
You okay?

521
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,050
No.

522
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:49,854
Bitches, man.

523
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:59,905
Boneys looking for you.

524
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,577
And her.

525
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,914
You started something.

526
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,461
I saw

527
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,589
pictures

528
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,840
last night.

529
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,594
Memories.

530
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,263
My mom...

531
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,600
Summertime.

532
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,269
Cream

533
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:33,356
of Wheat.

534
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,109
A girl.

535
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,569
A dream?

536
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:40,905
A dream.

537
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,700
We are changing, I think.

538
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,538
We are.

539
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:55,836
I have to tell her.

540
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,133
Will you help?

541
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,305
Help?

542
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,433
Exhume?

543
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,936
Exhume.

544
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,149
They said:

545
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,028
"Fuck, yeah!"

546
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:55,479
Wait here.

547
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:01,861
Be careful. Okay?

548
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,703
So I'll wait here.

549
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,980
It's not that bad. Come on.

550
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,127
Julie and I were giving the others hope.

551
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,795
And it was spreading fast.

552
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,506
I guess the Boneys didn't like that.

553
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,758
That must be why they're looking for us.

554
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,967
I have to tell Julie.

555
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:10,221
I have to explain what's happening
before it's too late. I have to...

556
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:14,016
Oh, no. Oh, no. Please, go!

557
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,893
Go with your friends! Leave me!

558
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,311
That's it! Okay.

559
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:57,476
No, I'm serious, Nora.
I mean, "Corpse" is just...

560
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:59,895
It's just a stupid name
that we came up with

561
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,064
for a state of being
that we don't understand.

562
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,149
Yeah.

563
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,151
Oh, my God!

564
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,321
What is wrong with me?

565
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,157
Okay.

566
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:14,660
I've got to tell you something.

567
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,287
This is kind of weird.

568
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,955
- Please do not freak out.
- No.

569
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,209
But I actually miss him.

570
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,506
- You... You miss him?
- I know, it's so stupid.

571
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,926
- Like you're attracted to him?
- No, I don't...

572
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,345
Like he could be your boyfriend?

573
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,098
Your zombie boyfriend?

574
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,436
I mean, I know it's really hard
to meet guys right now

575
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,188
with the apocalypse and stuff, trust me.

576
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,649
And look, I know that you miss Perry.

577
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,068
Okay? But, Julie, this is weird.

578
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:52,364
Like, I wish the Internet was still working
so I could just look up

579
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,366
whatever it is that's wrong with you.

580
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:55,784
Shut up.

581
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,953
All right.

582
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,040
Okay. I'm getting ready for bed.

583
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,791
Hey.

584
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,544
I'm glad you're back.

585
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,963
Yeah.

586
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,674
Have sweet dreams about your zombie.

587
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:12,551
All right.

588
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:51,882
Julie.

589
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:53,967
Julie!

590
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,428
Oh, my God.

591
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,890
R!

592
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,268
What are you doing here?

593
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,688
Came to see you.

594
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,148
R...

595
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:13,028
You can't just do that. It's dangerous.

596
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,657
Grigio, shut up! I'm trying to sleep!

597
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,450
Sorry!

598
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,788
Jesus, R, are you crazy?

599
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,083
The people here, they're not like me.

600
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,794
If they see you, you'll get killed.

601
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,337
Do you understand that?

602
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,132
Yes.

603
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,801
- Are you talking to yourself?
- No!

604
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,971
Okay, seriously,
what is going on out here, Julie?

605
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:45,519
Oh, my God! Is that him?

606
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,105
Yeah.

607
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:53,610
'Sup?

608
01:07:58,158 --> 01:07:59,575
I'm sorry.

609
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,621
I know. I'm sorry, too.

610
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,215
I actually missed you.

611
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,427
Me, too.

612
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,474
It's funny. You feel
warmer than I remember.

613
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,148
That's the patrol.
Come on, we better get you inside.

614
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,156
Come on.

615
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,701
You're lucky my dad
got pulled into some emergency thing.

616
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,913
You're safe here tonight, R.

617
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,625
After that, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

618
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:52,878
How did you die?

619
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:56,507
I don't remember.

620
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,674
How old are you?

621
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,095
Because you could be twenty-something,
but you could also be a teenager.

622
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,097
- You have one of those faces.
- Oh, my God.

623
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,517
And I can't even smell...
You don't smell...

624
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:07,601
He doesn't smell rotten.

625
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,896
- I don't...
- Amazing.

626
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,233
Nora, he didn't come here
for an interview. Stop.

627
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,283
Why did you come here, R?

628
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:28,121
To show everyone...

629
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,331
Show them what?

630
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,750
That we can change.

631
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:35,504
R, no one here is ever gonna buy that.

632
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,465
Not that we could get you
even close enough to tell them.

633
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,176
As soon as they saw you,
they would blow your head to bits.

634
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,764
Wait a minute. Did you say "we"?

635
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,851
Lots of us changing.

636
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,478
Dreaming.

637
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,481
That's kind of a big deal.

638
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,441
We have to move fast.

639
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:57,818
What do you mean?

640
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:02,114
Boneys chasing me. They're chasing us.

641
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,699
Okay, we have to go to my dad.

642
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,826
No, that is a very bad idea.

643
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,953
No, Nora, he was a reasonable guy once.

644
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,247
Oh, no, I think you're confused.

645
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,207
It was your mom that
was the reasonable one.

646
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:15,210
It was your dad that grounded you for
a year for stealing Peach Schnapps.

647
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:19,214
Are you serious? It's your dad
that likes to shoot Corpses in the head.

648
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,425
Well, what other choice do we have, Nora?

649
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:24,344
Still, we'd have to get
him through the city.

650
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:25,971
Someone would definitely see you.

651
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,389
There isn't much time.

652
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,267
We could fix him up.

653
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,144
What?

654
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,104
I have some makeup
that I was saving for a special occasion

655
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,549
that obviously isn't gonna happen.

656
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,986
Yeah. Yeah, we could.

657
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:44,239
We could put on a little bit of foundation,

658
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,119
maybe a little blush.
Probably a lot of blush.

659
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:50,996
No way.

660
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,498
Yeah, way.

661
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:01,673
Would you change the song, please?

662
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:04,843
What? It's funny.

663
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:07,512
No, it's not.

664
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,433
Fine.

665
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:46,593
There we go.

666
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,429
Oh, yeah.

667
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:00,899
Hold up...

668
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:03,735
You look hot!

669
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,166
What?

670
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,459
Nothing.

671
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,670
It's just, you look nice.

672
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,285
I don't know how my dad's gonna be.

673
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,763
He gets kind of crazy. This might not work.

674
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,139
Hey.

675
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,851
No matter what, we stay together.

676
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,229
We're changing everything.

677
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:23,982
I know.

678
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:28,153
Stay together. Promise.

679
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:30,697
I promise.

680
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,492
Come on.

681
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:38,288
Hey, it's game time. All
right, let's do this.

682
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,457
Excuse me.

683
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:43,960
Where are you guys headed?

684
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,128
To see my dad, Kevin.

685
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:46,922
Miss Grigio, I can't let you guys in.

686
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,507
We're on high alert around here.

687
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,927
- Why? What's going on?
- It's classified.

688
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,887
All right, well,
we have our own classified business,

689
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:54,971
so come on.

690
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,227
Hey.

691
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,646
Say something human.
Say something human.

692
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,106
How are you?

693
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,399
Nailed it.

694
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:07,901
Over here. He's fine.

695
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,548
Okay, you guys wait here.

696
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,562
What are you doing here?

697
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:46,314
What is going on? What is all this?

698
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,732
I'm not sure, but it's not good.

699
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,402
We've been getting reports

700
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,446
there are sizable packs
of skeletons and Corpses

701
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:54,573
coming toward us.

702
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,658
We don't know why,
but if they're here to attack,

703
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,142
there's nothing we can do about it.

704
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,953
Too many of them, too few of us.

705
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,831
So I want you to get home,
lock down the house.

706
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,542
I have the gun there, the Ruger SR...

707
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:09,546
This? Yeah, okay. I need to talk to you.

708
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,048
- Julie, not now.
- Dad, it's important.

709
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,219
This is gonna sound really crazy, but

710
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:20,432
I think the dead are coming back to life.

711
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:22,851
That does sound crazy.

712
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,811
They're changing, Dad. They're...

713
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:27,355
I don't know.
They're somehow curing themselves.

714
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,649
You think they're curing themselves?
How is that?

715
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,861
I saw it. It is really happening.

716
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,988
No. You know what is happening, Julie?

717
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,699
What's happening is every day
there are more of them and less of us.

718
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,576
They are not curing themselves.

719
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,369
We're their food source.

720
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:45,457
They are not becoming vegan.
Okay? They don't eat broccoli.

721
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:49,252
They eat brains, your mother's
and your boyfriend's included.

722
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,464
Okay? So I want you to wake up!

723
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,424
- I'll explain.
- Okay?

724
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,302
What do you mean, "you'll explain"?
Explain what?

725
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,470
I got this.

726
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,721
Get yourself home.

727
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,015
Barricade yourself in the shelter.

728
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,309
There is enough stuff there
that you can open up...

729
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:09,189
Hi.

730
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,193
Who are you?

731
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,195
This is R.

732
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,992
I didn't ask you. I asked him. Who are you?

733
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,085
You're a Corpse?

734
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:32,671
He saved my life.

735
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,674
He took care of me.

736
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,511
I triggered something in him

737
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,305
and that must have sparked
something in all of them...

738
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,141
- Now it's triggered something in me.
- No...

739
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,102
Dad! No! Dad!

740
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,687
We want to help.

741
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,565
Please, they don't want to attack us.
They want to help.

742
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,109
We're... We're getting better.

743
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:57,112
No. Things don't get better.
Things get worse.

744
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,865
People get bit, then they get infected,
then I shoot them in the head.

745
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:01,950
- No, Dad...
- That's what happened

746
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,577
to your mother,
and that's what's gonna happen to him.

747
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,539
I'm really sorry, Mr. Grigio.

748
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,004
Go. Get out of here and be safe,
no matter what. Okay?

749
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:16,464
Julie...

750
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:17,632
I have to go.

751
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,139
You're not gonna shoot me.

752
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,808
Yes. Yeah, I will. Totally.

753
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,363
Okay. That could have gone better.

754
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,075
I need to warn my friends.

755
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:46,328
- Where?
- The stadium...

756
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:53,251
Shit! Come on! Get on the subway!

757
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:51,976
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.

758
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,732
Coming through.

759
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,696
R.

760
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:09,035
Julie.

761
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:10,537
Hi.

762
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:14,249
Ready for a fight.

763
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:15,959
Yeah, I can see that.

764
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:20,004
Soldiers coming. Boneys closing in.

765
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,184
They're here now.

766
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,814
- Keep them out.
- We will.

767
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:42,569
Run.

768
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:30,742
This way, come on!

769
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,831
Sir, your daughter is with the Corpse.

770
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:37,999
I've got eyes on them.

771
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:14,846
Thank you.

772
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,864
Who the hell do we shoot?

773
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:34,782
This asshole.

774
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,037
Hi.

775
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:47,462
Hey. Hi. Hi.

776
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,050
We see Corpses fighting skeletons, sir.

777
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:56,471
Copy that. We're seeing
that over here, too.

778
01:22:58,515 --> 01:22:59,974
Sorry, can you repeat that?

779
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:02,935
Copy that. We're seeing
Corpses fighting skeletons, sir.

780
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,107
Shit!

781
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:29,379
It's over.

782
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,423
No. Keep you safe.

783
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:35,593
It will be okay.

784
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:09,127
R?

785
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:32,483
R!

786
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,944
R, please?

787
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:37,697
You okay?

788
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:39,449
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

789
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,836
Next one's the head.
Move away from him, Julie.

790
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:35,546
No!

791
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,340
Julie, move now.

792
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,717
Dad, you have to listen to me.

793
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,428
I know we lost everybody.

794
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:47,183
I know you lost Mom.
But you and me, we are still here.

795
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:52,480
We can fix all this. We can start over.

796
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:54,524
They need our help.

797
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:59,111
Please, Dad! Look at him.

798
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:01,739
He's different. He's...

799
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:06,911
Bleeding.

800
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,082
He's bleeding, Dad.

801
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,462
Corpses don't bleed!

802
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,090
Oh, God.

803
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,261
You're alive. He's alive!

804
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,431
You're alive.

805
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:31,394
Does it hurt?

806
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,354
Yeah.

807
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,439
Yeah?

808
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:38,651
Sir?

809
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,801
This is Colonel Grigio.
The situation has changed.

810
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:16,480
Let's get you two the hell out of here.

811
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:42,632
Are you still bleeding?

812
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,677
- Yes.
- Good.

813
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:49,263
Sorry.

814
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,767
On the one hand,
getting shot in the chest hurt.

815
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:53,976
Like, a lot.

816
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:58,439
But on the other,
it felt good to bleed, to feel pain.

817
01:27:58,523 --> 01:27:59,523
To feel love.

818
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,987
I wish I could say
we cured the Boneys with love,

819
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,199
but really, we just straight
up killed them all.

820
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,494
It sounds kind of messed up,
but no one felt too bad about it.

821
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,621
They were too far gone to change.

822
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:17,625
It was actually a really good bonding
experience for us and the humans.

823
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,877
Once we joined forces,
they didn't stand a chance.

824
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,592
The ones we didn't kill just wasted away.

825
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,929
And the rest of us?

826
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:32,223
Well, we kind of learned how to live again.

827
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:37,812
For a while, it seemed like
a lot of us forgot what that meant.

828
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:53,744
The humans began to accept us,
connect with us, teach us.

829
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,956
This was the key to the cure.

830
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,004
It was scary at first, but

831
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:06,382
every great thing starts out
a little scary, doesn't it?

832
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,315
This is how it happened.

833
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,612
This is how the world was

834
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,698
exhumed.

835
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,630
You need some help?

836
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,008
Yeah.

837
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:52,470
I have zombie fingers.

838
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:55,765
Thank you.

839
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:00,978
Here.

840
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,647
Oh, it's okay. I don't mind the rain.

841
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:04,815
I insist.

842
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:08,486
I'm...

843
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,407
Marcus.

844
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,243
Emily.

845
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,583
You're... You're very pretty.

846
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:26,045
Thank you, Marcus.

847
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:29,673
Now you're supposed to say I'm pretty, too.

848
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:35,763
R?

849
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:37,348
Yeah?

850
01:30:37,808 --> 01:30:39,475
Do you remember your name yet?

851
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:41,519
No.

852
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,564
Well, you know,
you could just give yourself one.

853
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,901
Just pick one. Whatever you want.

854
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,405
I like "R."

855
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:55,699
Really?

856
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:59,161
You don't want to know what it was?

857
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:01,956
You don't want your old life back?

858
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,290
No.

859
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:05,793
I want this one.

860
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,885
Just "R," huh?

861
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:17,555
Just "R."
