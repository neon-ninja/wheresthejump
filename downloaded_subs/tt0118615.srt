Tales of monstrous, man-eating anacondas

2
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,059
have been told for centuries by Amazon tribes.

3
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:36,813
Some are said to worship giant snakes.

4
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:40,734
Anacondas are ferocious, and enormous.

5
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:44,029
They can grow up to 40 feet long.

6
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,741
They do not merely eat their prey.

7
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,412
They regurgitate it in order to kill and eat again.

8
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:37,522
Please, help! Somebody, help!

9
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:44,571
This is an emergency. Somebody, please!

10
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:16,021
Please ...

11
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,651
ARlAU JUNGLE HOTEL, BRAZlL DEEP lN THE AMAZON

12
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:21,610
- Miss Flores. - Professor. When did you get in?

13
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:27,324
A couple of days ago. I've been out asking about our tribe.

14
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:33,623
- Any luck? - The evidence is they're out there.

15
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:38,044
And can be found... or so I told the grant people!

16
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:43,633
My guide thinks they're here. He found one of their markers.

17
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:48,305
- That's good! - I think we have a chance.

18
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:53,185
- Get me there, and I'll shoot it. - That's why I hired you.

19
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:58,607
- I appreciate the work. - I wanted the best director.

20
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:02,277
I think we'll make a good team.

21
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:05,260
You're a mess. What happened to you?

22
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:10,652
Just a small piranha attack. I barely escaped with my life.

23
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:35,062
- Somebody's up awfully early. - Well, today's a good day.

24
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,692
Not every day my home girl gets to direct a documentary.

25
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:45,447
- You ready? - I think so.

26
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,536
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

27
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:54,707
ls this a pleasure cruise?

28
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:59,943
Come on... you know me. I don't mix business with pleasure.

29
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,223
Okay, what about... if we go up through here?

30
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:09,118
This way better. lf not, I cannot be responsible.

31
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:16,521
Well, it's only 55 kilometers more. Better safe than sorry.

32
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,141
- Mateo, you understand me? - Sure.

33
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,615
- I need some shots over there. - As you say, cheffe.

34
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,726
- For your approval. - Thanks.

35
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:35,155
- So, where's Westridge? He checked in. - Probably getting his beauty sleep.

36
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:36,918
Careful!

37
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:42,382
Careful! Bordeaux! Fragile. Expensive wine.

38
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,096
- Good morning. - Morning. How was your flight?

39
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:52,476
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare. Ongoing, I think.

40
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:58,649
- One zoom lens ... - You! Stow this in my room, will you.

41
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:02,048
Excuse me... I'm the production manager.

42
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:05,591
Then so do you can manage my things into my room!

43
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:08,202
One pompous ass ...

44
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:13,553
You know, in some cultures, that's a sign of friendship respect shows for asking you to carry their bags.

45
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,833
Respect this!

46
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,851
Mr Westridge Terri Flores.

47
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,409
Terri, this is a pleasure.

48
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,968
I've seen some of your films. I thought they were... promising.

49
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:29,806
- It's hot! Are we on the equator? - Welcome aboard... I guess.

50
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:33,009
- I think he likes you! - You felt that too?

51
00:08:34,853 --> 00:08:37,522
It's Jacques Cousteau!

52
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:43,925
- Joinez-moi avec mon equipe. - Whatever the hell that means.

53
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,430
Its good to see you man.

54
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:48,267
Cheffe, ready for Rio Negro!

55
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:54,749
Everybody! Check your gear and pray you remembered bug spray.

56
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:19,316
Our adventure begins 1,000 miles from the mouth of the Amazon.

57
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:24,655
From here, we travel unexplored backwaters

58
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:29,535
in search of the illusive... People of the Mist, the Shirishama tribe.

59
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,840
One of the last great mysteries of the Rain Forest.

60
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,728
ls it just me, or does the jungle make you horny?

61
00:09:56,547 --> 00:10:02,262
- Oh no... I think it's the jungle. - I'm serious, I've got one thing on my mind.

62
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:06,279
Can I work, please?

63
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:23,675
Help!

64
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:29,431
Save me! I'm stranded.

65
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,436
My boat is stranded in the ropes. Help me!

66
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:40,972
Check this out, there's a dude on a boat over there.

67
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,223
Hey! Pull over to his boat!

68
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:53,372
We'll bring you on board.

69
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,966
Thank the Lord for you! Thanks the Lord.

70
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:05,783
Are you hurt?

71
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:11,419
- Are you okay? - My propeller tore off in the roots.

72
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:16,082
We can't take you back to Manaus. We headed up river.

73
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:21,551
At the next village, I know the people. They help me fix my boat.

74
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:26,783
- I apologize for the trouble. - There's no need.

75
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:32,199
We're all at the mercy of machines. Yours broke.

76
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:36,375
Mateo, vamonos.

77
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:03,065
- Fish, river style! - Not bad!

78
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,911
We should get that on film next time.

79
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:15,416
- Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr...? - Sarone. Paul Sarone.

80
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:20,004
- Where are you from, Mr. Sarone? - Paraguay.

81
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,827
- Really? - I studied to be a priest.

82
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:28,763
But then I needed to see the real world.

83
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:32,997
So I ended up in the jungle. I seem to fit.

84
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,880
So, what does a failed priest do in the jungle?

85
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:43,393
Failed? Who says I failed? I didn't fail.

86
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:48,039
I'm sure you didn't. So what is your calling now?

87
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:50,466
- Snakes. - Snakes?

88
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,903
I catch them.

89
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,999
For zoos and collectors.

90
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:58,219
- Whatever they want - Poaching?

91
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,758
Poaching is illegal. May I ask you... What are you hunting?

92
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:06,511
We're not hunting or trapping anything.

93
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:11,933
We're making a documentary on the Shirishama lndians.

94
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:16,477
- The People of the Mist? That's right - You know of them?

95
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:22,789
- I've seen them. - Really... could you show me where?

96
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:28,837
You saved my life. I can show you exactly where I saw the Shirishama.

97
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:35,779
So slurs every river rat after five whiskies in any Manaus bar.

98
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:40,154
Five whiskies? That's breakfast on the river.

99
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:48,463
Does salad go well with fish river style?

100
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:52,153
Salad would be perfect, little baby bird.

101
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:17,229
Look at that.

102
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,419
Are they fireflies?

103
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:31,888
Pretty, huh? Family Lampyridae.

104
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:39,056
They use their night flashes to announce that they're ready to mate.

105
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:45,650
- Who flashes? Males or females? - Both, actually.

106
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:50,230
The females with short, dainty, feminine flashes...

107
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:56,989
- and the males with long, drawn-out, manly flashes.

108
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:04,456
I like that. No pick-up lines, no misunderstandings.

109
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,319
Just instinct and nature.

110
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:16,906
I've missed you.

111
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,839
Bloody racket!

112
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,053
Hey! Don't touch my radio!

113
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:46,632
I could cheerfully hire someone
to kill you.

114
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:53,877
- 15 dollars should cover it. - I could just kill you for free.

115
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:57,094
- You and whose army? - Your mama's!

116
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,335
So...are we getting close?

117
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:07,932
- Just around this bend. - Perfect.

118
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,966
A snake totem pole.

119
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:37,276
It's the Shirishama's.

120
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:42,376
Shirishama worship giant snakes. Anacondas. As gods and protectors.

121
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:47,330
They have a legend of a journey to a sacred lake.

122
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:51,289
First you pass a waterfall but that could takes you by warrior snakes.

123
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,560
Once you pass the guardian Then you travel through the land of the Shirishama,

124
00:17:56,073 --> 00:18:01,287
- until you come to a wall so high, it blots out the sky...

125
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:06,502
Then after five days, you reach the head of a giant anaconda.

126
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,855
- You know the story. - Of course, a beautiful legend...

127
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,471
I believe... however its a legend of the Maku.

128
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,043
- Also the Shirishama. - Not to my knowledge.

129
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:26,692
Their village was right here. They're down this fork.

130
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,993
- I know. I trap snakes, for living. - And I'm sure you're good at it.

131
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:36,174
l locate tribes for living. I'm very good at that.

132
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,372
The water level is high, so my calculation means that the area at this side will be flooded.

133
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:48,157
So our tribe would seek higher ground over here.

134
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,512
- Which way? - This way.

135
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,619
I want a shot of you with the totem. Gary, roll sound.

136
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,672
Camera rolling. Action!

137
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:07,091
Our first piece of luck: a Shirishama idol.

138
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:12,433
I know what I know. Leave me at the next village.

139
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,096
With pleasure.

140
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:19,979
What the hell was that all about?

141
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,373
- We'll go get some wild sound. - Just be careful.

142
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,215
See you guys.

143
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,167
Gary...

144
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,698
It's unbelievable.

145
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:44,086
- Gary ... - What?

146
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:50,899
Oh my God!

147
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:14,308
Wait.

148
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:18,197
Do you hear that?

149
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,765
The silence.

150
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,386
- What was that? - I don't know.

151
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,368
Mateo, shine the light over there.

152
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,016
These two are fortunate to be alive.

153
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,739
- What happened? - You should have seen it!

154
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,989
He just blasted this thing coming right at us.

155
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:30,783
Wild boar. Gores with his tusks. Goes for the eyes.

156
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,278
- Denise, are you okay? - Yeah, thanks.

157
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:41,054
- Everybody stays on board at night. - That's a smart idea.

158
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:48,655
Mateo, let's cut him up. Food for a week.

159
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:52,656
Food?

160
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,964
- My turn? - It's my turn.

161
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,628
Mateo, do you have control of this vessel?

162
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:39,433
Lie, if you must.

163
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:45,556
The rope's caught in the propeller.

164
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,355
I'll cut us loose.

165
00:23:56,397 --> 00:24:01,090
Let me. This river can kill you 1,000 ways.

166
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:07,168
I can handle it. The only thing I'm afraid of is the candiru acu.

167
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:14,038
It's a tiny little catfish. It swims up into your urethra

168
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,381
- spreads its little spines and refuses to budge.

169
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:26,328
- You have to cut it out. - That's it! I'm going back to L.A.

170
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,959
Terri, something's wrong!

171
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:44,850
Cale?

172
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:50,998
- He's hurt. I'm going. - Hold up!

173
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:54,777
Hurry up!

174
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,294
ls he breathing? Faster, come on!

175
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,931
Hurry!

176
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:11,881
What is it?

177
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:15,722
Careful.

178
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:23,021
- Get something for his head. - He's not breathing.

179
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:27,771
There's something in his mouth.

180
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:31,677
- Oh my God! - Damn! What's that?

181
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:39,699
A wasp. Deadly. Poisonous.

182
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:43,920
He's still not breathing. What do we do?

183
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:49,301
- How did this happen? - Alcohol.

184
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,635
I've got whiskey in my flask.

185
00:26:57,081 --> 00:27:00,418
- Quickly. - What's that for?

186
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:16,053
- He's breathing! - That's it. He'll be all right.

187
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:41,491
- He seems okay, we should go now. - The radio don't work.

188
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:47,176
- I can't fix, okay? - We can start now.

189
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:50,666
No... fog.

190
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:55,839
We must get him to hospital soon, or he'll die.

191
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,544
What? Terri, we got lights.

192
00:28:00,704 --> 00:28:04,875
Good. Mateo, we'll just double back.

193
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,148
Fighting the current, lose two days.

194
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,072
Cut back to this tributary, save us fifty miles.

195
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:24,849
- This the route you suggested that we take yesterday. - Yesterday for a different reason.

196
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:29,120
Now, it's to get Professor Cale to hospital as fast as possible.

197
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:37,860
I hope you know what you're doing. I don't know about this dude.

198
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:41,477
What choice do I have?

199
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:33,478
What the hell is this? Terri, come here.

200
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:46,201
- This is the river you know? - No, this is new.

201
00:29:47,932 --> 00:29:50,331
But no cause for panic.

202
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:59,086
I'm not panicking. I'm just looking at this wall blocking our way.

203
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:06,396
- Let's see what we can do. - Its that dynamite?

204
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:08,066
It's always good to be prepared.

205
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,337
Prepared for what?

206
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:14,957
- That thing must be there for a reason - Yeah, to keep us out.

207
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:20,159
I'm talking about upsetting the ecological balance of this river.

208
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:26,397
I can blow it in ten minutes, so if you feeling sensitive, we can turn around and lose two days.

209
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:27,985
It's up to you.

210
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:34,505
Terri?

211
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:40,040
For God's sake, blow the bloody thing!

212
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:45,395
Just give me ten minutes, people. Ten minutes.

213
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,680
I need some help. Gary, get the little boat.

214
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:40,198
- There's something down there. - That's right.

215
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:42,464
I really mean it.

216
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:43,725
I really mean it too.

217
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,617
Hurry.

218
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:28,778
Damn it! Snakes!

219
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:37,848
- Babies! - How do we get them off the boat?

220
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:41,149
Come on babies, come on back to your Mama.

221
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:47,032
They're not all babies.

222
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:51,940
Calm.

223
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:57,257
- You little shit! - Sarone, help him, get it off.

224
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:02,736
Someone get this bloody thing off my hand!

225
00:33:05,955 --> 00:33:10,335
- So young, and so lethal. - Get it off me!

226
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:19,368
Later, Sweetie!

227
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:23,214
- You knew there were snakes here! Didn't you Sarone.

228
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:25,364
- It was a pleasant surprise.

229
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,724
- What about the fuel?

230
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:30,975
- There's only one drum left that's enough for about 100 km.

231
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,518
About a day's ride. That will have to do.

232
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:37,319
Back to your mother.

233
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:59,325
- How's he doing? - He's breathing normally now.

234
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:00,809
That's good.

235
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:07,105
- We'll get him home. - I just don't know what's going on, you know.

236
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:13,805
Sarone supposed to help us get back to the hospital, right?

237
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,717
But he acts like he owns this river.

238
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:24,527
And we run into a barrier full of snakes. Where's he taking us?

239
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:57,997
Mateo... Mateo. Stop the boat.

240
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:05,903
- Stop it. Why are we stopping now?

241
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:08,258
There'll be fuel.

242
00:35:13,115 --> 00:35:17,807
- You know that boat? - There's lots of boats like that.

243
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,723
Hello!

244
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,581
I get the impression there's nobody home.

245
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:35,797
Mateo, come with me.

246
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:40,184
Hold up.

247
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:46,030
- I'll get this on film. - You don't need sound, do you?

248
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,139
Go aft.

249
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:37,461
Sarone!

250
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:49,264
- Kind of spooky. - You think so?

251
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:04,298
What the...

252
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:46,080
- Help me. - What's that?

253
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:49,320
Treasures.

254
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:00,477
Here.

255
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:08,233
Be careful, my camera's in here.

256
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:21,257
Mateo, that's it let's go!

257
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:24,503
Hei... I'm coming. I'm coming.

258
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,806
What's all this?

259
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,753
- And what about the fuel? - There wasn't any fuel.

260
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:09,115
- Where's Mateo? - I don't know, he was right behind us.

261
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:12,027
Mateo!

262
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:23,232
- I'm going back. - Sarone, go with him.

263
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:28,937
- Maybe some other time. - Asshole.

264
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:40,011
We stuck in the middle of nowhere, and now we've lost our driver!

265
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:41,976
Mateo!

266
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:50,210
Come on man, stop playing!

267
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:19,212
Danny?

268
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:23,600
Danny?

269
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:30,588
Danny?

270
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,492
- Yeah. - You okay?

271
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:41,253
- I'm all right. I didn't see him. - How very reassuring!

272
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:46,099
- This is it. - This is all you found?

273
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,615
- What the hell is this? - Anaconda skin.

274
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:59,990
- Is snake out there this big? - It's skin maybe four years old.

275
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:04,283
It's grown by now. Something like this made a meal of our captain.

276
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,649
- Snakes don't eat people. - Oh... they don't?

277
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:20,007
Anacondas are perfect killing machines. They have heat sensors.

278
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:24,680
A warm body like Mateo's in the water, wasn't hard to find.

279
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:30,995
They strike, wrap around you. Hold you tighter than your true lover.

280
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:38,514
You get to hear your bones break before your veins explode.

281
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:43,742
- Mateo's probably just lost. - Oh, wake up!

282
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:50,204
lmagine capturing it alive. That's worth a lot of money, Gary.

283
00:42:52,869 --> 00:43:00,168
Please people, don't make me out to be a monster. I didn't eat the Captain Mateo.

284
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:06,737
Come on, everybody... We are not sure that Mateo is dead.

285
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:10,895
- So, we'll wait here till morning. - Are you insane?

286
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:15,998
You think he went for a walk? We've got to get out of here.

287
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:18,489
- Get a grip Westridge!! - I've got a grip.

288
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:21,680
We're not leaving. lf it was you, you'd want us to stay too.

289
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:26,058
Listen! lf it was me out there, I'd be dead. Don't you see.

290
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:32,824
- Just, go into your cabin, and lock the door. - Like a bad boy.

291
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:35,171
All right. All right.

292
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,275
Where are my shoes?

293
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:41,901
- We'll aim some lights at the boat. - That's a good idea.

294
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:10,512
I'm not so sure he didn't eat the captain.

295
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:13,741
He sure looks satiated.

296
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:20,815
You think he's still alive?

297
00:44:23,685 --> 00:44:25,771
No. Let's go to bed.

298
00:44:28,922 --> 00:44:30,173
Danger...

299
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:35,862
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?

300
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:41,990
You go on to bed, I'll just talk to him a second.

301
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:45,211
- Hurry up, I'm scared. - I'll be right there.

302
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:59,553
- So... It's out there, isn't it? - Yeah.

303
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:04,235
- And you know how to catch this things right? - That's right.

304
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:10,427
But you can't catch anaconda by yourself, you need a partner.

305
00:45:10,456 --> 00:45:14,627
Capture alive... Maybe a million dollars, Gary.

306
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:28,183
REPTlLE TRANQUlLLlZER

307
00:45:52,322 --> 00:45:54,408
Still no Mateo.

308
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:41,328
Keep it steady, Westridge!

309
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:58,348
- What the fuck are you doing? - Anaconda bait.

310
00:46:58,374 --> 00:46:59,417
Oh my God!

311
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:10,750
- Westridge, let's go. - Stop! Not on my boat.

312
00:47:11,316 --> 00:47:17,051
You speak for everybody? Gary? Does she speak for everybody?

313
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:21,632
Gary?

314
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:30,583
With Cale sick, the movie's off. Why not salvage something?

315
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:34,771
Let's film Sarone capturing the big snake.

316
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:41,091
- Have you lost your mind? - No, I'm completely lucid.

317
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:44,493
I think it's you guys who need to open your eyes.

318
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:48,956
Are we go for taking Cale to hospital, now we're catching a snake?

319
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:52,366
You know where you're, you're in the middle of the jungle!

320
00:47:52,396 --> 00:47:55,525
All you guys do is question and criticize.

321
00:47:55,526 --> 00:48:00,739
But just remember, you don't know shit about all this. Neither do l.

322
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:06,640
But I know who does. This guy! Paul has been here.

323
00:48:06,662 --> 00:48:11,772
lf we help him catch the snake, then he'll help us get out of here, alive.

324
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:15,960
And that is common freaking sense.

325
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:22,254
Come on, Gary, this isn't you! Honey, what did he do to you?

326
00:48:22,258 --> 00:48:25,177
Stop. Think of the money.

327
00:48:25,188 --> 00:48:31,444
lmagine capturing something like this on film for the first time ever.

328
00:48:31,983 --> 00:48:34,173
Just to be honest, what else we suppose to do?

329
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:39,928
I know what I'm doing. I'm gonna throw you two in the river by myself!

330
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:47,030
- I don't think so. - I didn't want this to happen people.

331
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:51,168
- Let's go, Westridge. - Ok.

332
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:54,351
Gary.

333
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:59,146
Occupy yourselves. Play some cards.

334
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,940
Nobody move!

335
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:05,972
Gary, turn on the lights!

336
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:09,675
Westridge, stop the boat.

337
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,855
Buenas noches!

338
00:51:17,656 --> 00:51:21,514
- Come down here, Westridge. - You'll get us killed!

339
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:26,744
That's it, go for the eyes! Blind it!

340
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:31,611
Fishing for snakes! He's crazy!

341
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:36,306
- Just let it go. - Westridge, come here! Come down here!

342
00:52:03,964 --> 00:52:05,006
Where is it?

343
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:31,180
Don't move. I'll tranquillize it.

344
00:52:52,272 --> 00:52:54,879
Denise, get up here! Get up here!

345
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:01,712
Gary, help me!

346
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:06,735
- Get up here! - Grab her, man!

347
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,454
It's in the water.

348
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:30,941
Gary, give me your hand.

349
00:53:39,024 --> 00:53:42,152
No! it's no good to me dead.

350
00:53:45,909 --> 00:53:47,995
Gary!

351
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:53,121
Oh God!

352
00:54:31,031 --> 00:54:33,638
May the souls of the faithful departed...

353
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:38,123
... through the mercy of God rest in peace.

354
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:43,740
- Westridge! - How dare you!

355
00:54:46,842 --> 00:54:52,055
It was you who brought that snake. You brought the devil.

356
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:59,939
There's a devil inside everyone. Horrible.

357
00:55:00,043 --> 00:55:01,086
Westridge.

358
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,167
Take my gear up to the pilot house.

359
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:16,415
- I'm not your bloody poodle. - What?

360
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:20,873
- You presume to order me about? - Presume?

361
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:25,724
How you like I presume to throw you in the river?

362
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:30,850
- Take it upstairs. - Thank you.

363
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:37,972
Everyone else, don't move.

364
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,582
Get back.

365
00:55:57,744 --> 00:55:59,829
Terri, let's talk.

366
00:57:26,514 --> 00:57:27,870
You want something?

367
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,924
I just want to talk to you.

368
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,855
I was thinking about the myth.

369
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:55,782
I don't know, I figure all about this, this film was supposed to be my big break.

370
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:58,339
And it's turned out to be a big disaster.

371
00:58:04,777 --> 00:58:06,341
So I was just thinking -

372
00:58:09,314 --> 00:58:15,570
- that maybe I could film you capturing the snake.

373
00:58:19,322 --> 00:58:21,929
And then it wouldn't have all been for nothing.

374
00:58:25,191 --> 00:58:27,276
I don't know it could be dangerous.

375
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,649
I know.

376
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:39,381
But you'd be there to protect us.

377
00:58:39,988 --> 00:58:41,447
You need protection?

378
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:54,239
It's been a long time... since I had a woman.

379
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:06,698
You think I'm stupid?

380
00:59:09,585 --> 00:59:10,836
I'm not stupid!

381
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:20,087
- Shall I hit him again? To make sure... - No just throw him in the river!

382
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:21,853
Haven't we enough of that?

383
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:27,272
- I'm afraid I'd rather enjoy it. - Come on, just tie him up! Ok.

384
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:04,705
This was all one big setup, huh?

385
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:11,428
Mateo, you stranded, the shipwrecked boat...

386
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:14,578
- Your route to the hospital. - You forgot the wasp.

387
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:33,059
What you do is not so hard. I can trap a snake, too.

388
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:37,857
As smart as you are, you can survive without me.

389
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:51,750
We're gonna be home soon, okay?

390
01:01:13,005 --> 01:01:17,176
I can't believe how good you're doing. Hang in there, baby.

391
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,717
- ls it hard to drive? - No. Like a Cadillac Fleetwood.

392
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:31,241
I tell you up... I'll give you a driving lesson.

393
01:01:31,328 --> 01:01:35,187
Black knobs: Up to get forward and down here back.

394
01:01:35,351 --> 01:01:38,793
Red knobs: Up to get fast and down to get slow.

395
01:01:39,017 --> 01:01:44,543
Wheel: left and right. You get any trouble, turn off the ignition.

396
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,974
Take it for a spin. Take us back to civilisation.

397
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:55,514
- Shit, no problem! - Take us back to...

398
01:01:56,653 --> 01:02:01,762
- Crisp sheets and hot showers. - The play-offs and a six-pack!

399
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:07,584
- Golf, and a gin and tonic. - L.A. traffic and mobile phones.

400
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:08,705
Don't start!

401
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:39,125
The waterfall. A beautiful sight, baby bird.

402
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:43,423
- The legend was right. - What is this place?

403
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:50,615
Oh dear. It's absolutely beautiful.

404
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,448
- What the hell was that? - I think we hit the bottom.

405
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,976
Turn the wheel hard over left.

406
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:09,675
All right, put it in reverse.

407
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:13,693
Shut it down.

408
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:32,209
We got to winch ourselves loose.

409
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:36,185
Wait, wait what are you doing? And get in the water?

410
01:03:36,253 --> 01:03:42,093
We ain't got much choice. We'll wrap a rope around that tree.

411
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:47,144
You wrap a rope around that tree. pull it tight or we're stuck here forever.

412
01:03:47,164 --> 01:03:53,942
- We've got to make it quick, in and out. - I rather hoped I'd done my bit.

413
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:00,812
- That's our rope. - Just enough to go round the tree right?

414
01:04:00,812 --> 01:04:01,855
Yeah.

415
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:06,213
Take this and get it around that trunk, make sure it's secure.

416
01:04:06,245 --> 01:04:07,288
Roger that.

417
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:14,642
Last time I tried this, I had to pick leeches off my scrotum.

418
01:04:53,073 --> 01:04:54,637
Aren't you going to pray?

419
01:04:56,398 --> 01:04:59,527
Never look in the eyes of those you kill.

420
01:05:00,775 --> 01:05:03,903
They will haunt you forever. I know.

421
01:05:16,615 --> 01:05:18,179
I firmly resolve...

422
01:05:18,629 --> 01:05:23,843
... with help and grace to confess my sins...

423
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:26,324
... and amend my life. Amen!

424
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:32,245
Sanctus... sanctus... sanctus...

425
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,563
... baby bird.

426
01:05:57,342 --> 01:05:58,385
Hurry up.

427
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:21,941
Shit! back on the boat. Now! Come on!

428
01:06:22,842 --> 01:06:23,884
Go!

429
01:06:27,807 --> 01:06:30,935
Get on the boat. Go on, hurry!

430
01:06:38,896 --> 01:06:40,981
Over here, you fat-ass bastard!

431
01:06:55,835 --> 01:06:57,191
Westridge... get up on the rocks.

432
01:06:57,268 --> 01:06:59,354
- Go! - Get up on the rocks.

433
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:03,998
It's coming. Go!

434
01:07:06,028 --> 01:07:09,156
- Go get the gun. - What are we gonna do?

435
01:07:09,344 --> 01:07:10,908
Go, get it!

436
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:17,001
Hurry up!

437
01:07:19,651 --> 01:07:22,258
- Westridge, keep going! - Danny, watch out!

438
01:07:55,129 --> 01:07:56,693
Danny move your arm!

439
01:08:34,647 --> 01:08:38,609
Danny! Danny!

440
01:08:38,624 --> 01:08:40,709
- Danny. - Yeah.

441
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:46,038
Westridge! Westridge! Shit!

442
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:02,872
Come on, hurry up!

443
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:06,647
I'm caught.

444
01:09:10,598 --> 01:09:12,683
Come on Danny, hurry up.

445
01:09:36,232 --> 01:09:37,796
Danny, hold on!

446
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:19,980
You killed my warrior snake.

447
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,035
Get up.

448
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:29,905
The dart.

449
01:10:37,263 --> 01:10:39,870
The tranquillizer's working. Get him!

450
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:53,321
Damn, the dart came out his back.

451
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,376
Come on, almost there.

452
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:10,216
Baby ..? He's lost consciousness again.

453
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:16,016
I'll try to get us out. The tree knocked us loose.

454
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,335
Terri, look.

455
01:11:55,253 --> 01:11:58,382
- They might have some fuel. - Let's check it out.

456
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:06,849
- Need some help? - No, I'm cool.

457
01:12:26,523 --> 01:12:29,130
I don't even want to know what happened here.

458
01:12:31,906 --> 01:12:33,470
I hope they got some fuel.

459
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:24,090
Damn!

460
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:30,349
Those drums... Could be fuel.

461
01:14:02,947 --> 01:14:04,511
A snake skin.

462
01:14:15,628 --> 01:14:18,965
- Look there's plenty of fuel in here. - Welcome!

463
01:15:07,761 --> 01:15:09,325
Time to wake up.

464
01:15:20,503 --> 01:15:23,944
- Monkey blood. - I'm gonna kill you, Sarone!

465
01:15:25,474 --> 01:15:27,039
Don't get me upset.

466
01:15:34,222 --> 01:15:35,473
See this?

467
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:40,714
Human bones. That's how it comes out.

468
01:15:41,472 --> 01:15:42,828
Ashes to ashes ...

469
01:16:01,326 --> 01:16:03,933
Shit, Oww! shit, look!

470
01:16:06,277 --> 01:16:07,633
Come on.

471
01:16:35,856 --> 01:16:37,212
Go!

472
01:17:41,966 --> 01:17:43,425
Gotcha!

473
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:05,518
Get loose.

474
01:18:32,213 --> 01:18:34,298
Let's get the fuel. Let's out of here!

475
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:43,510
Don't worry, just go! Run! It's coming for you.

476
01:19:36,904 --> 01:19:38,677
Danny, where are you?

477
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:43,945
- It's a nest. - I'll go up the smokestack.

478
01:19:44,048 --> 01:19:47,698
- No, I've got the legs. - We can trap it there.

479
01:19:50,576 --> 01:19:51,931
Go!

480
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:21,602
- Can you climb out? - I can use the rope.

481
01:20:21,773 --> 01:20:23,858
Hurry, I think I can blow him up.

482
01:20:38,276 --> 01:20:40,883
- I'm going to light it. - Go ahead, I'm at the top.

483
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:51,959
Danny!

484
01:20:57,579 --> 01:21:00,290
- Get out, the fuse is lit. - Danny, wait!

485
01:21:04,142 --> 01:21:06,749
Push on the other side hit the hinges.

486
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:27,746
- Terri jump! - I can't, it's too high.

487
01:21:27,844 --> 01:21:29,095
Just jump!

488
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:16,299
I got you. Come on.

489
01:22:21,647 --> 01:22:23,211
Did we get him?

490
01:22:29,097 --> 01:22:30,661
We got him.

491
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,097
You all right?

492
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:43,851
We should get the fuel, so we can get out of here.

493
01:22:45,797 --> 01:22:46,839
Come on.

494
01:23:15,627 --> 01:23:16,669
Bitch.

495
01:23:25,027 --> 01:23:26,591
Let's get out of here.

496
01:23:44,151 --> 01:23:45,194
Miss Flores...

497
01:23:49,307 --> 01:23:50,662
You're a mess.

498
01:24:17,374 --> 01:24:21,024
I found another one. Let me see that.

499
01:24:23,664 --> 01:24:24,707
Shirishama.

500
01:24:26,814 --> 01:24:32,132
- Sarone was right. - Danny!

501
01:24:41,371 --> 01:24:45,542
- Damn... I'll get the camera. - You think so?

502
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,227
- Aright, roll film! - Camera rolling.
