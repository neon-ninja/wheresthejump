Roger, hard to port.

5
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,671
Hard to port.

6
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,007
I need navigational information.

<i>Like this...</i>

10
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,315
Still no answer at Taguchi's?

11
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,067
No.

12
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,612
It's been a week.
He must have his reasons.

13
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,202
It shouldn't take a whole week
to work on that disk.

14
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,912
No, it shouldn't...

15
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,873
Something's wrong.

16
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,376
Maybe I should see if he's okay.

17
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,629
I just got the creeps.

18
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,673
What?

19
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,176
I don't know, I just feel
like something's wrong.

20
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,055
Like something's...
horribly wrong.

21
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,448
What's up with Taguchi?

22
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,242
I don't know.

23
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:43,080
If we don't get that disk now,
we're in real trouble.

24
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,793
The deadline's tomorrow.

25
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,295
I know that.

26
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,591
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't heard a thing.

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,596
I think I'd better go see
how he's doing.

Hey, Michi...

38
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,390
I was worried about you.
You haven't called.

39
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,225
Right, sorry.

40
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,438
Did you finish working on that disk?

41
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,524
Yeah, it's somewhere in that pile.

42
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,532
You okay?
Are you sick?

43
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,576
No...

44
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:13,040
What have you been up to,
all on your lonesome? We're friends.

45
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah...
Stuff...

46
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,795
Help yourself to the disk.

47
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:25,260
You ought to label your disks.

48
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,350
This it?

49
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,868
The one marked Work File?

50
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,247
Taguchi?

51
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,512
Michi.

52
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,679
Oh, Junko.

53
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,098
You okay? Was it awful?

54
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,475
I'm fine.

55
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,519
I'd say it's break time.

56
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,442
Oh, I forgot. Here.

57
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,319
Thanks.

58
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,037
It's so upsetting.

59
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,500
I don't know what he was
so depressed about.

60
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,339
He never said anything,
so what could we have done?

61
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,634
Maybe...

62
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,931
he suddenly just wanted to die.

63
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,852
I get that way sometimes.

64
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,238
It's so easy to hang yourself.

65
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,836
Hey! Why so gloomy?

66
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,379
Oh, sorry.

67
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,798
About Taguchi?

68
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,843
It's just...
If only I'd...

69
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,555
He seemed like the Taguchi I know.

70
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,977
I never imagined
he'd do something like that.

71
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,315
Time to put it behind us.
Besides, it wasn't your fault.

72
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,816
Yeah...

73
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,914
Say...
Would you take a look?

74
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,791
At what?

75
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,043
Taguchi's disk.

76
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,679
What is it?

77
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,022
It's Taguchi's place.

78
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,441
Is that Taguchi?

79
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,402
Yeah, I think so.

80
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:54,946
Look.

81
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,249
What's going on?
Isn't that the same scene?

82
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,959
I can't tell.

83
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,629
Hey, look.

84
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,673
That's a face...

85
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,467
A reflection.

86
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,760
You're right.

87
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,012
Can you blow it up?

88
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,181
Let me see...

89
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,836
That was Taguchi, wasn't it?

90
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,380
Sure seems like it.

91
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,007
What's going on?

92
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,512
Maybe something strange is going on.

93
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,389
Strange?

94
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,515
I don't know.

95
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,892
I don't even care anymore.

96
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,942
Something's definitely not right.

00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,279

"Welcome to the Internet."

115
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,580
No, this way, here.

116
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,497
Okay.

117
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,084
Next, okay.

118
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,419
Next.

119
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,466
"Have Fun."
Okay, I'll have fun.

120
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,637
Done. "Okay."

121
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,732
What's this crap?
Yes, I agree.

122
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,576
Next...

123
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,080
What? I guess that's okay.

124
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,626
Next again, huh?

125
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,419
What?

126
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,430
What the...?
Oh, well...

127
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,655
What the hell...?

128
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,629
Hey... this...

129
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,715
Who's... what's...

130
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,997
<i>Would you like to meet a ghost?</i>

131
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,810
Stupid crap!

132
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,408
What the...

133
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,059
Maybe you should change
the size on this batch file.

134
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,852
Using the variable?

135
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,020
Yeah.

136
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,732
So you'll find its property, right?

137
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,611
Oh, conventional memory.

138
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,071
Right.

139
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,156
See.

140
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,159
So that's how you do it.

141
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,547
Say...

142
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,301
Can the internet dial you up itself?

143
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,555
You in computer science?

144
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,892
No, economics. No relation.

145
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,271
Sounds like a hacker.

146
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,399
A hacker...

147
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,621
It said,
"Do you want to meet a ghost?"

148
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,749
Some website like that.

149
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:31,171
A ghost...

150
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,623
Which website was that?

151
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,082
What?

152
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,002
Something about meeting ghosts?

153
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,756
I don't really know.
It just appeared last night.

154
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,841
Know the address?

155
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,220
What? Um... address?

156
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,888
I see.

157
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,559
Windows?

158
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,769
Yeah.

159
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,230
Open the Explorer log...

160
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:35,068
Oh, no, no, I really don't know
anything about computers.

161
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,698
The next time the site shows up,

162
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,826
click on it to bookmark it.

163
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,787
Not so fast.

164
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,164
Click...

165
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,923
Can you repeat that?

166
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,007
Click on it.

167
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,301
Click... on... it...

168
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,136
To bookmark it.

169
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,640
To...

170
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,934
bookmark it.

171
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,687
If that doesn't work,

172
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,856
you know the print screen key?

173
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,566
Yeah, this one?

174
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,151
Try pressing it.

175
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,863
If it doesn't work...

176
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,242
Print screen key.

177
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,245
Press the...

178
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,956
Print screen...

179
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,249
Got it.

180
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,667
Let me know?

181
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,002
Sure.

182
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,922
See you.

183
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,699
Don't bother with that, Mom.

184
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,784
What? Sure.

185
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,669
Are you eating this junk again?

186
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,172
It's not good for you.

187
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,804
I'm going now.

188
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,434
Have you called your father?

189
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,769
Nope.

190
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,231
I see... but what if
you get in trouble?

191
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,318
I can't rush over.

192
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,907
It's awkward for me to see him,
but you should.

193
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,576
Forget it.
He's out of the picture.

194
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,079
He lives here in Tokyo.

195
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,081
But Tokyo's huge.

196
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,832
I know, but...

197
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,418
I'm fine.
I've got my friends.

198
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,338
You sure?
I guess you'll be all right then.

199
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,299
You're so trusting
and get carried away...

200
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,973
Hello.

201
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,812
Hello.

202
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,022
<i>Help...</i>

203
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,442
<i>Help...</i>

204
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,781
<i>Help...</i>

205
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,241
Who's this?

206
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,827
<i>Help...</i>

207
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,042
What is this?

208
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,294
THE FORBIDDEN ROOM

209
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:44,877
Taguchi?

210
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,631
What happened, Taguchi?

211
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,886
What?

212
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,224
What am I saying?

213
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,800
What happened to Yabe?

214
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,304
Try his house?

215
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,681
No answer.

216
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,894
I hope nothing's wrong.

217
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,151
Oh, no. What's he up to?

218
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,446
I've got to go see him.

219
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,782
No! Don't go!

220
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,785
He'll turn up.
He'll come if we wait!

221
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,829
Nothing strange has happened yet.

222
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,457
Yeah...

223
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,542
Let's just act normal.

224
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,671
Yeah, at least for today.

225
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,401
Sorry, I'm late.

226
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,654
Sure, sure.

227
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,907
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?

228
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,867
Hey!

229
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:34,250
Can you believe, he's ignoring us!

230
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,751
What's going on?

231
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,295
Who cares...

232
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,888
What do I do now?

233
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,974
Click it...

234
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,351
and bookmark it.

235
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,645
Doesn't work.

236
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:04,608
If that doesn't work,
press the print screen key.

237
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,075
There.

238
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,399
Hi.

239
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,777
You're the one...

240
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,698
Kawashima.

241
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,117
Kawashima.

242
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,451
Yeah, Kawashima.

243
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,621
I'm Harue Karasawa.

244
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,541
Ms. Harue, Ms. Harue.

245
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,590
How'd it go?

246
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,343
Well, it came back again.

247
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,553
Really?

248
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,012
Yeah.

249
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,057
And...

250
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,228
I pressed that print screen key...

251
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,983
Right.

252
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,528
Can I come over and check it out?

253
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:58,240
Yeah, sure, absolutely fine.

254
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,534
I just need a minute.

255
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,816
What's this?

256
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:38,864
That? Something we programmed here.

257
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,286
If two dots get too close,
they die,

258
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,956
but if they get too far apart,
they're drawn closer.

259
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:51,710
What's it for?

260
00:36:56,924 --> 00:37:00,010
A miniature model of our world...

261
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,475
But only the grad student
who designed it understands it.

262
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,325
I wouldn't...

263
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,164
suggest staring at it for too long.

264
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,884
Sorry, it's a mess.

265
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:42,761
Thank you.

266
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,649
There you go.

267
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,150
Thank you.

268
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,154
Getting the data?

269
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,990
Yeah, almost set.

270
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:33,186
What got you started on the internet?

271
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,441
Nothing in particular...

272
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,153
You don't like computers, right?

273
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:42,321
No.

274
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,908
Wanted to connect with other people?

275
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:52,414
Maybe... I don't know.

276
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,292
Everybody else is into it.

277
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,213
People don't really connect,
you know.

278
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,423
What?

279
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,803
Like those dots simulating humans.

280
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,306
We all live totally separately.

281
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,229
That's how it seems to me.

282
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,026
I wonder...

283
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,040
Yabe...

284
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,297
<i>Ms. Kudo!</i>

285
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,382
Yes.

286
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:47,386
Can you move these orchids
into the greenhouse?

287
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,097
Yes.

288
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,193
Boss...

289
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,444
Yes?

290
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,989
Isn't Yabe acting strange?

291
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,950
You think so?

292
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,245
Can I go check on him?

293
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,122
Fine, but...

294
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,875
It might be a waste of time.

295
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:26,550
Words said in friendship
with the best of intentions...

296
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,680
always wind up
hurting your friends deeply.

297
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,517
And then you wind up getting hurt.

298
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,440
Is friendship always that way?

299
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,443
If that's so, what's left?

300
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,737
If I were you...

301
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,788
Who needs friends like that?

302
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:01,710
A courageous choice in itself.

303
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,608
Are you okay?

304
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,739
Did something happen?

305
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,829
If something happened,
let's talk about it.

306
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,423
Both Junko and I...

307
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,259
are really worried.

308
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:55,847
I saw...

309
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,225
A face...

310
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,976
What?

311
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,646
A horrible face...

312
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,194
I've never seen anything like it...

313
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,989
What are you saying?
What did you see?

314
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,160
The Forbidden Room.

315
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,080
Forbidden Room?
What's that?

316
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,503
Is that...

317
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,756
the room with the red tape?

318
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,591
Don't dare go in there!

319
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,807
Please...

320
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,309
tell me.

321
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,271
What happened?

322
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,781
I'm cold.

323
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,998
Yabe...

324
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,461
Are you okay?

325
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,279
EXIT

326
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,406
Harue.

327
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,034
Hi.

328
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:52,041
I don't really use the library much.

329
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,419
Couldn't find the way out.

330
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,925
PHANTOMS

331
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,221
You reading this?

332
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,015
Yeah.

333
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,602
Is it related to your work
in the lab?

334
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:14,397
Yeah.

335
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,030
Do you have a minute?

336
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:25,408
What? Sure.

337
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,744
Come.

338
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:46,721
<i>Isn't it strange?</i>

339
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,433
<i>Yeah... sort of...</i>

340
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,570
<i>Almost like ghosts, right?</i>

341
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:07,116
<i>You're right, they're like ghosts.</i>

342
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,456
Sometimes, these turn up.

343
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:17,043
At first, they look like the other dots.

344
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,338
What are they?

345
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,715
I don't know.

346
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:25,927
A bug?

347
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,637
No.

348
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,283
That website...

349
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:49,576
What?

350
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:54,163
What happened with that?

351
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,708
Nothing... yet...

352
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:01,462
But I think they're related.

353
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,134
I'm sure they're related.

354
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:08,636
You think?

355
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,860
Let me know if anything happens.

356
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,403
Yeah, sure.

357
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,497
Ms. Karasawa...

358
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,458
I need you to check this.

359
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,751
Yes.

360
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,545
And you are?

361
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,839
My friend, Kawashima.

362
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,177
My senior grad student, Yoshizaki.

363
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,219
Hello.

364
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,452
I forgot to give you my number.

365
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,789
- Right.
- Call me, okay?

366
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:19,999
Right.

367
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,584
Anytime, okay?

368
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,002
Yeah.

369
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,420
Thank you.

370
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:34,013
"Everyone dies, therefore there's
no logical reason for ghosts not to exist.

371
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:39,686
"How many ghosts have...

372
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:43,106
"existed since prehistoric times..."

373
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,833
Do you see it too?

374
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,297
Sure you do,
because it's really there.

375
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:13,052
Who is that?

376
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,973
You'll have to catch him
to find out.

377
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:22,061
Start right now,
and you might succeed.

378
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:27,734
Wanna try?

379
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:29,777
What?

380
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,031
Why don't you, right now?

381
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,995
He disappeared.

382
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,663
I see.

383
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,878
He must be a student...
I don't know him.

384
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,800
Maybe you're right.
Sorry I encouraged you.

385
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,177
See you.

386
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:40,848
Wait a minute.

387
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,105
Just what was that?

388
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:06,457
I'm cold...

389
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,809
The spirit...

390
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:29,564
Or consciousness, the soul,
whatever you want to call it,

391
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:33,776
it turns out the realm
they inhabit has a finite capacity.

392
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:39,115
Whether that capacity
accommodates billions or trillions...

393
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,368
eventually, it will run out of space.

394
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:46,706
Once it's filled to the brim...

395
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,710
it's got to overflow
somehow, somewhere.

396
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,087
But where?

397
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,884
The souls have no choice

398
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:01,429
but to ooze into another realm,
that is to say, our world.

399
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,349
<i>Maybe, at first...</i>

400
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,769
<i>it started with something
really simple.</i>

401
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,420
Once that realm
reached critical mass...

402
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:37,798
any device would have sufficed.

403
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:41,636
Thrown together with
the means and materials at hand.

404
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:43,262
That's how I see it.

405
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:48,184
Excuse me, do you have any tape?

406
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:52,355
Anything'll do, some tape.

407
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,233
How's this?

408
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,401
Thank you.

409
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,269
<i>After many hours or days...</i>

410
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,690
<i>or many weeks, it finally happens.</i>

411
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,452
<i>Through that process,
it spread around the world.</i>

412
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:33,497
But now they're no longer
the faint presence they began as.

413
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,043
You saw one yourself.

414
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,258
I don't believe your stories.

415
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,470
Right, sorry, it's all hypothetical.

416
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,143
Thanks for the tea.

417
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,436
Are you okay?

418
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,104
Just fine.

419
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,483
But if this really happened,

420
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,693
there's no turning back.

421
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:06,655
No matter how simple the device,

422
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:10,910
once the system's complete,
it'll function on its own...

423
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,287
and become permanent.

424
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,748
In other words...

425
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,126
the circuit is now open...
that's how it looks.

426
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,160
<i>Hello.</i>

427
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:56,247
<i>I see, our boss isn't there?</i>

428
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,417
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

429
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:02,169
If he does stop by,

430
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:05,548
will you please ask him to call us?

431
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,260
Yes, thank you very much.

432
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,475
Michi...

433
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,272
what do you think's going on?

434
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:30,239
Why's everyone disappearing?

435
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:50,092
Hello.
This is Sunny Plant Sales calling.

436
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,845
Thank you for your business.

437
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,765
Is our boss there with you
by any chance?

438
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:02,646
I see...
Thank you, and excuse me.

439
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,569
I'll go look for him.

440
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,280
Wait, Junko, wait.

441
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,829
Yes, hello...

442
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,293
Boss?

443
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,129
<i>Help.</i>

444
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:30,299
Yabe!

445
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,928
Are you Yabe?

446
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,432
Yabe!

447
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:51,487
Help me...

448
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:05,459
Help me...

449
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,255
Help...

450
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:14,301
Help...

451
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:20,266
Help...

452
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:26,063
Help...

453
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:35,864
Junko...

454
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,535
Junko!

455
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,989
Junko, no!

456
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,119
Junko!

457
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,459
Are you okay?

458
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,003
Are you okay?

459
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,381
Help me...

460
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,550
Help me...

461
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,719
Help me...

462
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,642
Junko!

463
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,229
Look, I'm right here.

464
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,691
I'm right here, it's okay.

465
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:41,842
Excuse me.

466
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:16,460
HARUE KARASAWA
TEL: 090-4079-2677

467
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,793
What are you doing, Harue!

468
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:07,005
You're dripping wet!

469
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:09,549
They went away...

470
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,928
They've all disappeared...
They always do...

471
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:14,471
I have to run away...

472
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,765
Run away somewhere...

473
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,561
Harue!

474
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,356
Hey, Harue!

475
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,400
Listen, Harue!

476
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,652
Harue!

477
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:31,196
Calm down! Harue!

478
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:54,261
Thank you...

479
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:29,004
I always wondered
what it's like to die...

480
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,798
From when I was really little...

481
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,594
I was always alone.

482
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,555
Any parents or family?

483
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:42,184
Sure, but they're irrelevant.

484
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,853
Right...

485
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,609
That after death...

486
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:54,071
you live happily with
everyone over there.

487
01:07:54,196 --> 01:07:56,698
Can we stop talking about this?

488
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,575
But it may be true.

489
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,995
Sure, but...

490
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:06,541
Then in high school
it dawned on me...

491
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,880
you might be all alone
after death, too.

492
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:18,261
There's no way to know.

493
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:19,971
How could you?

494
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:23,683
The idea was so terrifying.

495
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,270
I couldn't even bear it.

496
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:31,316
That nothing changes with death,

497
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,902
just right now, forever.

498
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:43,662
Is that what becoming
a ghost is about?

499
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:48,875
You can't mess with that.
It's really bad.

500
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,420
What have ghosts got to do with us?

501
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,422
Besides, we're alive.

502
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,427
Then, who are they?

503
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:10,230
Are they really alive?

504
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,152
How are they different from ghosts?

505
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,745
In fact...

506
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,249
ghosts and people are the same...

507
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:33,086
whether they're dead or alive.

508
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,552
It's not right.
It's wrong.

509
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,096
They're all crazy.

510
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,810
Nobody knows what happens
when you die.

511
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:53,190
All this about ghosts, but I won't
believe in them, even if I see one.

512
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,358
But I do know...

513
01:09:56,401 --> 01:10:01,198
that I'm definitely alive
and so are you, Harue.

514
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:03,241
That's for sure, right?

515
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:09,164
So I don't want to think about
the fact we'll die someday.

516
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,168
Just maybe...

517
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:17,297
in 10 years, or at least
while we're still alive...

518
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:20,050
they'll invent a drug
that prevents death.

519
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:23,345
Then, we could live
forever and ever.

520
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:28,225
Of course you might think
I'm crazy to say that, but...

521
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,810
I'd rather bet on that.

522
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,065
You want to live forever?

523
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,858
Yeah.

524
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,861
That sounds like fun?

525
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:43,114
Yeah...
That's what I think.

526
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:53,959
Maybe I've got it all wrong.

527
01:10:58,672 --> 01:10:59,756
No...

528
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:05,762
It'll turn out just like you say.

529
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:09,933
I'm sure.

530
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,060
What?

531
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,149
Ghosts won't kill people.

532
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,904
Because that would just
make more ghosts.

533
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:26,700
Isn't that right?

534
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,873
Instead, they'll try
to make people immortal.

535
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:39,879
By quietly...

536
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:45,176
trapping them
in their own loneliness.

537
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,688
Help...

538
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:01,151
Help...

539
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:08,510
Junko, it'll be okay.

540
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:11,179
It'll be okay.

541
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,681
Okay...

542
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,411
I fell asleep...

543
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,959
How do you feel?

544
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,252
Yeah.

545
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:46,172
Something to drink?
How about some coffee?

546
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:01,229
Michi...

547
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,398
What?

548
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:08,403
Am I just going to die like this?

549
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,574
Of course not.

550
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:16,161
That's right...

551
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,497
I'll just keep on living,
all alone...

552
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:43,771
What?

553
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,065
No.

554
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:21,100
Junko!

555
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,145
Junko.

556
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,106
Junko!

557
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,541
Junko!

558
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:51,589
Why! Why!

559
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,393
Junko, don't go!

560
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,812
Junko.

561
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,280
Mother?

562
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,910
Mother?

563
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,290
Mother!

564
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:14,631
I'll be right there.

565
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,204
Harue...

566
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,335
Harue! Hey...

567
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:05,802
Kawashima...
take me with you.

568
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,725
I'm scared to be alone.

569
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,650
Take me somewhere.

570
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:35,706
Okay, sure.

571
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:38,793
Where to?

572
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:40,503
Somewhere far away.

573
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:43,965
OUT OF ORDER

574
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,342
Shit, let's just go!

575
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,842
There's no one...

576
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:32,179
No...

577
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:40,897
Where did everyone go?

578
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,236
I'm here.

579
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,368
I'm here beside you.

580
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,958
Even if...

581
01:22:02,043 --> 01:22:05,338
there's no one else,
it doesn't matter.

582
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:10,593
We are both definitely here.

583
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:20,561
Guess that's true...

584
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:53,594
What happened?

585
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:00,851
I've got to go back!

586
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:03,854
What? No! We've come this far!

587
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,816
But this is the end of the line.

588
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:09,860
That's not true. It'll start moving.

589
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:12,655
I'll go check with the driver.
Come with me.

590
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:17,034
Okay, but promise
you'll wait right here.

591
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,161
I'll be right back.
Promise.

592
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:58,617
Harue!

593
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:09,438
THE FORBIDDEN ROOM

594
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,216
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS -
RED TAPE

595
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,538
I'm...

596
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:18,002
not alone...

597
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:38,856
Harue,

598
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,025
it's me, Kawashima.

599
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:46,447
Harue! Listen!

600
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,328
Listen, what do you say to this...

601
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,539
The two of us live together.

602
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,459
That way,
we can always be together.

603
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:02,713
If we keep living alone,

604
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:06,300
we'll get worse and worse
because we're weak.

605
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:08,969
We'll balance each other out.

606
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,430
How 'bout living that way?

607
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,266
Would you try it with me?

608
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:17,436
What do you think, Harue?
Listen!

609
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:27,696
Harue!

610
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:30,199
Harue!

611
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:33,160
Harue!

623

Yeah.

624
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,267
Want some?

625
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:31,862
You are?

626
01:31:32,905 --> 01:31:35,115
Oh, me? Um...

627
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:38,952
What are you doing here?

628
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,458
What am I doing here...

629
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:47,961
You?

630
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:58,680
So neither your dad nor your mom...

631
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:00,891
made it through...

632
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:02,601
No...

633
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:06,647
So many things happened at once...

634
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,983
it's impossible
to sort them all out.

635
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:11,985
Yeah.

636
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:18,909
Me too.
My head's all messed up.

637
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:23,288
So you're a student, Kawashima?

638
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:24,456
Yeah.

639
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:26,959
Lucky you.

640
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:28,961
I don't think so.

641
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:29,878
Here.

642
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,838
Thanks...

643
01:32:35,384 --> 01:32:36,635
And you?

644
01:32:37,261 --> 01:32:38,845
I had a job.

645
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:40,931
Amazing.

646
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,516
Nothing amazing.

647
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,980
Did you have any friends?

648
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:49,940
Friends?

649
01:32:52,943 --> 01:32:54,570
Maybe one, I guess.

650
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:56,738
What was she like?

651
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:01,994
What?
I don't really know...

652
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:06,456
I never really found out...

653
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,584
Where is she?

654
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:10,836
Somewhere...

655
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,008
Okay, try starting it.

656
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,396
Okay, good.

657
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:48,957
Why don't you look for her?

658
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:50,125
What?

659
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:55,213
She's still somewhere, right?
You've got to help her then.

660
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:58,508
But...

661
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:02,888
Let's go find her.
I'll help you.

662
01:34:09,478 --> 01:34:12,022
This is the last stop...

663
01:34:17,069 --> 01:34:20,113
After that we go as far as we can.

664
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:28,372
I can sort of see...

665
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:30,666
The future...

666
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:44,596
HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP

667
01:35:08,537 --> 01:35:09,996
Look over there.

668
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,335
An abandoned factory?

669
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:23,760
I wonder...

670
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:28,390
Shall we try it?

671
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:50,495
Listen, even if you see a door
sealed with red tape,

672
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,248
don't go near it, okay?

673
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:55,125
I know.

674
01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:20,817
You okay?

675
01:36:59,231 --> 01:37:01,775
Look... at this.

676
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,079
Look... over there.

677
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:42,274
Kawashima.

678
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:43,650
Harue!

679
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:45,318
Watch out!

680
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:49,406
What happened, Harue?

681
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:52,576
What are you doing with that?

682
01:37:56,705 --> 01:38:00,584
Let's get out of this place,
together.

683
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:04,671
Together?

684
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:06,590
Yeah.

685
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:21,271
C'mon, hand it over.

686
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:23,023
Harue! Harue!

687
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:29,446
Oh, no, a hospital...

688
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,711
Harue! Don't die!

689
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,880
C'mon! Please!

690
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:49,799
Help me!

691
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:53,970
Harue!

692
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,819
We couldn't save her...

693
01:39:12,197 --> 01:39:13,365
No...

694
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:39,265
We're out of gas...

695
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,687
I'll get some,
there was gas back there.

696
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:45,105
You'll be okay?

697
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:47,816
Wait for me.
I'll be okay.

698
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:46,768
<i>Forever...</i>

699
01:41:49,229 --> 01:41:51,314
Death was...

700
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:54,234
Eternal loneliness...

701
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:04,285
Help.

702
01:42:05,537 --> 01:42:06,996
Help.

703
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:09,541
Help.

704
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:13,795
Don't ask me!
What's that got to do with me!

705
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,714
Forever...

706
01:42:17,549 --> 01:42:19,300
Death was...

707
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:21,928
Eternal loneliness...

708
01:42:29,811 --> 01:42:31,604
You're not real.

709
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:36,234
I refuse to acknowledge...
never...

710
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:39,237
I refuse to acknowledge death!

711
01:43:23,907 --> 01:43:25,325
I know.

712
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:28,745
I'll catch you.

713
01:43:29,579 --> 01:43:31,664
Then you'll disappear.

714
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:35,460
That's it, right! Right!

715
01:43:36,502 --> 01:43:38,838
You can't beat me!

716
01:44:08,117 --> 01:44:09,744
I am...

717
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,832
Not an illusion...

718
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,282
Kawashima!

719
01:46:18,623 --> 01:46:19,791
What is it?

720
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:22,460
Forget it... Let's go...

721
01:48:37,929 --> 01:48:39,680
It's too much...

722
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:55,446
What... are you doing?

723
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:05,289
You went in there...

724
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,209
Me?

725
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:12,421
Yeah, I did, but I'm fine.

726
01:49:27,687 --> 01:49:29,230
Don't cry.

727
01:49:53,004 --> 01:49:54,589
You want to go back?

728
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:57,842
To what's left of Harue?

729
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:05,558
That make you feel better?

730
01:50:11,022 --> 01:50:14,650
If that's what you want,
I'll go with you.

731
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:19,572
No...

732
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,366
Let's go...

733
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:25,202
As far as we can go.

734
01:50:29,915 --> 01:50:31,876
Are you sure about that?

735
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:39,383
Yeah.

736
01:50:58,069 --> 01:50:59,278
Can you get out?

737
01:51:06,952 --> 01:51:07,953
You okay?

738
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,385
Be careful.

739
01:51:33,312 --> 01:51:34,730
Wait here, okay?

740
01:52:49,722 --> 01:52:53,058
<i>Death comes to us all...</i>

741
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:57,772
<i>If so, maybe we would
have been happier</i>

742
01:52:57,897 --> 01:53:00,441
<i>if we had gone with the rest.</i>

743
01:53:00,983 --> 01:53:04,195
<i>But we chose to keep going...</i>

744
01:53:04,862 --> 01:53:07,364
<i>into the future...</i>

745
01:53:26,634 --> 01:53:29,345
We'll head for South America.

746
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:32,348
We're still getting signals there.

747
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:35,100
Though they're pretty weak.

748
01:53:36,435 --> 01:53:38,479
We've got to give it a try...

749
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,649
No matter what we find.

750
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:47,905
