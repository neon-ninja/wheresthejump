1
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,788
Mom?

2
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,430
Mom?

3
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,341
Oh, my God!

4
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,990
Push it the other way.
Come on, guys, push it!

5
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,158
Move when you got the ball!
Nobody's moving.

6
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,949
Know where your teammates are!

7
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,293
All right, hold up. Hold it up.

8
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:07,418
New ball. We are going
to play with this ball.

9
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,042
- Invisiball.

10
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,468
Catch.

11
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,673
It's pretty funny. You
think it's pretty silly.

12
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,843
This is the place it's okay to feel silly,
the practice floor.

13
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,728
Not with people
in the stands watching you play.

14
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,685
All right, you guys. Run a couple plays.

15
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,349
Let's set it up. Three game.

16
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,563
- Where's the ball?
- It's in my mind, Coach.

17
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,287
- It is in your mind.
- It's in my mind.

18
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,611
One brain! One brain!

19
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,860
There you go! That's the way to move it!

20
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,366
You guys play better with the invisiball

21
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,943
than you do the real ball. I like it.

22
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,169
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, how are you?

23
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,671
Good, how are you?

24
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,833
You spaz. Yeah, I was there all alone.

25
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,376
- Hi.
- Hey.

26
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,637
You're late.

27
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,014
Practice ran long.

28
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,519
Oh, uh, Clyde, shoes, please?

29
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,399
What is this?

30
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,564
I needed the extra space for the business.

31
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,928
We're officially up and running.

32
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,235
Hmm.

33
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,954
Yeah.

34
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,538
The jewelry design.
I told you I was getting back into it.

35
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,884
Stephanie, I had a bunch of stuff in here.

36
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,004
Oh, yeah, I boxed up all your stuff.

37
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,084
I put your name on it.

38
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,331
Everything's in the closet
right here in the hallway.

39
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,130
Don't you think maybe
I should have packed up

40
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,215
my stuff from my office?

41
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,635
Clyde, it's not your office any more.

42
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,404
Hey, kiddo. You ready to go?

43
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,738
Which one do you think is a better slogan?

44
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,248
"Stop The Killing, Eat Vegetables,"

45
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,081
or "When You Eat Animals,
You Become One"?

46
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,503
First of all, that is awesome,
but I'm going to say, as far as slogans go,

47
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,425
"Stop The Killing," it's super catchy.

48
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,837
- Gets the message across?
- Loud and clear.

49
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,756
Miss Shandy said that if we get
200 signatures on this petition,

50
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,716
she'll take it to the principal

51
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,551
and they'll consider doing
meat-free Mondays

52
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,635
in the cafeteria.

53
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,017
Wow, that's going to make you so popular.

54
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,561
Dad, you need to understand that

55
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,937
we're all one big family on this planet,

56
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,477
no matter what species,

57
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,611
and we don't eat our own family, do we?

58
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,238
No, we certainly do not.

59
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,443
- Hi, Clyde.
- Hey.

60
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,122
Careful, Brett.
You are entering a shoe-free zone.

61
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,703
I know.
I got that sign for Stephanie.

62
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,752
You wouldn't believe the bacteria
that gets dragged into a house.

63
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,170
Oh, I'm sure I wouldn't.

64
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,002
- Hey!
- Hi.

65
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,916
So what are you guys up to tonight?

66
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,293
- We're going to a concert.
- Nice.

67
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,470
Season tickets. Wagner.

68
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,805
Wagner? Stephanie loves
Wagner, don't you, dear?

69
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,640
I'll have 'em back Sunday after lunch.

70
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,145
Okay.

71
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,690
Um, Em's still doing the vegetarian thing,

72
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,814
so keep an eye on her,
and her allergies, please.

73
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,819
Last time she came back with hives.

74
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,065
And just healthy food, okay?
Stuff that grows on trees?

75
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,199
No pizza, please. I mean it.

76
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,702
You done?

77
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,495
Yes.

78
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,997
- Stephanie...
- Yes?

79
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,873
I think I got this.

80
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,375
- Okay.
- Okay.

81
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,541
- Bye you guys! I love you!
- Bye!

82
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,632
Brett says I have an overbite.

83
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,089
Oh, give me a break. Your teeth are fine.

84
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,680
Brett's job is to tell
people that they have bad teeth.

85
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,185
That's how he makes his money.

86
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,772
No, he said he'd fix my teeth for free.

87
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,603
Uh, Dad?

88
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,942
Yeah?

89
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,944
You passed your apartment.

90
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,026
Oh, I did, didn't I?

91
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,606
Ta-dah!

92
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,033
What is it?

93
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,319
What is it? This is our new house.

94
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,737
It's in the middle of nowhere.

95
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,821
Isn't it awesome?

96
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,036
And critters come over
from those woods over there.

97
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,246
Yesterday, two raccoons on our porch.

98
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,410
Really?

99
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,041
Come on, Mopey McGee.

100
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,464
Wow, this is pretty cool.

101
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,379
Right? Bedrooms are upstairs.

102
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,140
I call the room facing the woods!

103
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,312
You got it. That's your room.

104
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,477
Dad, there's a doggie door!

105
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,023
Let's get a dog from the shelter, Dad.

106
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,107
Please, let's get a dog.

107
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,902
Please, pretty please, please.

108
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,189
You've got to be kidding me.

109
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,320
This does not work on me any more.

110
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,206
Daddy, yes, it does.
Please, please, please, please.

111
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,786
Cheers.

112
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,664
- Cheers.
- Cheers, kiddo.

113
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,673
You know, I think
Mom would really like this house.

114
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,088
We should invite her for breakfast.

115
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,006
Em, Mom and Dad

116
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,012
are officially divorced
as of three months ago.

117
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,223
Mom's not coming over for pancakes.

118
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,586
- Hannah, that's enough.
- But it's getting old.

119
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,440
Em's always talking about how you guys
are going to get back together.

120
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,862
Em, your mom and I, we just sort of, uh...

121
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,611
I don't know. We kind of
forgot how to get along.

122
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,285
And you're both moving
on with your lives.

123
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,406
I know. That's what Mom
always says.

124
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,625
Your mom says that?

125
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,588
Okay, well, then, there you have it.

126
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,381
You know, it's for the best.

127
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,758
Okay? So let's have our dinner.

128
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,972
I'm not hungry any more.

129
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,434
All right, clear your plate.

130
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,652
Hannah...

131
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,278
You can't say stuff like that.

132
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,634
It's going to upset your sister.

133
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,819
For real? You're going to
blame this on me?

134
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,663
Nice, Dad.

135
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,921
"Will you walk a little faster,"
said the whiting to the snail.

136
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,757
"There's a porpoise close behind us,"

137
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,835
"and he's treading on my tail."

138
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,378
How was your day today?

139
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,889
It was all right. How was yours?

140
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,845
Dinner was a failure.

141
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,056
Well, just make sure that
Mom doesn't find out about dinner,

142
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,223
because she'll be mad
that pizza doesn't grow on trees.

143
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,233
I'll give you $5 if you
don't tell your mother.

144
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,394
Make it 35 and we have a deal.

145
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,821
Go to sleep.

146
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,070
Leave the door open.

147
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,238
What's the matter? Are you scared?

148
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,205
No. Just... I want it open, okay?

149
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,422
Dad, you need dishes.

150
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,262
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

151
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,767
Oh, okay.

152
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,599
<i>Hey, Clyde, it's Trevor down at NC.</i>

153
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,129
<i>Hey, give me a ring.
I wanted to run something past you.</i>

154
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,565
<i>Hope you're good, pal.</i>

155
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,442
Dad, look! Look, I'm a lady.

156
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,128
Cool.

157
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,854
Daddy, can I get this?

158
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,280
That is a lovely hat.

159
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,065
Whatever you want, kiddo.

160
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,327
So we found a couple of things.
What's the damage?

161
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,077
- How about 55?
- 55.

162
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,836
My daughters have cleaned me out.
I have $48.

163
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,167
We're happy to put something back.

164
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,248
Oh, no. No, no. That's all right.

165
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,674
- You sure?
- Yeah.

166
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,467
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

167
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,720
So you're gettin'
rid of a lot of stuff.

168
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,173
You guys, uh, moving or something?

169
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,933
No. Just a
couple of bills came up.

170
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,176
Oh.

171
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,222
No! No!

172
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,276
Look at these carvings. They're so pretty.

173
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,572
These directions are ridiculous.

174
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,018
Hey, Em, would you do me a favor

175
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,409
and hand me the small screwdriver, please?

176
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,621
But, Daddy, you said
you'd get this open for me.

177
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,084
Well, that's weird. There aren't any seams.

178
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,594
What does that mean?

179
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,347
Well, I think that means
that whoever made this

180
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,015
didn't want anybody to open it,

181
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,435
or at least they didn't want
anybody to open it easily.

182
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,607
You hear that? There's something in there.

183
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,317
So somebody had to open it,
once upon a time.

184
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,360
- That is absolutely correct.

185
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,844
- Daddy, no. Daddy, please.
- Sweetie, I've gotta take this.

186
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,905
Trevor, hey.
Sorry, I keep missing your calls.

187
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,989
Daddy.

188
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,783
<i>- How's my old friend doing?</i>
- Good, good, uh...

189
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,947
- Daddy...

190
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,170
<i>You're running a good program up there.</i>

191
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,251
<i>You've had two back-to-back
conference titles.</i>

192
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,165
You calling just to chat?

193
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,834
<i>The folks on our
athletic board are taking note.</i>

194
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,719
<i>Thought it was time
you come down to North Carolina,</i>

195
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,968
<i>have a discussion about your future.</i>

196
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,632
What are we talking about here?

197
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,769
<i>We're talking about you moving
up to Division One, Clyde.</i>

198
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,600
Does Coach Hill know you're doing this?

199
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,225
<i>He's retiring end of the year.</i>

200
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,228
<i>He was the one who told me
to get in touch with you.</i>

201
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,401
<i>Said the school needed
one of their own boys</i>

202
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,319
<i>to come back home and take the reins.</i>

203
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,194
What can I say? Hell, yes, I'm interested.

204
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,421
- What's going on?
- I don't know. It wasn't me.

205
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,713
- - Dad!
- Hannah! What is it?

206
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,764
It was on my face! Get it off!

207
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,920
What are you talking about?

208
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,285
It's under the covers! Get it off!

209
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,687
Dad!

210
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,768
You did not just do that on my bed.

211
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,091
Hannah, you told me to kill it.

212
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,105
I told you to get it out.

213
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,907
God, Dad.

214
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,445
She told me to kill it.

215
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,541
It's a moth!

216
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,551
Make some noise

217
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,970
for the most dazzling divas of dance

218
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,632
who always bring it fierce,

219
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,301
the Silverstars!

220
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,686
Hey, are you okay?

221
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,319
- I feel funny.
- What?

222
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,445
I feel funny.

223
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,776
What do you mean?

224
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,659
I don't feel like me.

225
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,076
I know this stuff with Mom and Dad sucks,

226
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,413
but we're just the kids,
and they're the adults,

227
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,418
and sometimes we just have to go along

228
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,589
with their stupid mistakes.

229
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,171
But I think you'll feel better
if you just stopped giving a shit.

230
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,691
Hi! Hey! on...

231
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,947
Oh, hi, Mommy.

232
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,223
- I missed you guys a lot.
- I missed you, too, Mom.

233
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,654
How was the weekend?

234
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,862
It was good. We had pizza.

235
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,162
Wow, yes, the new house has a pizza tree.

236
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,364
- Is Jen's mom coming?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,416
Uh, your outfit is on your bed,

238
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,795
and will you just take
one of your allergy pills just in case?

239
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,797
If one of your players had food allergies,

240
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,157
you'd be writing
threatening notes to the cafeteria ladies

241
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,342
with detailed menu demands.

242
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,597
Cut me some slack.

243
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,970
I was going to go inside, get the boxes.

244
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,930
- Okay.
- Okay.

245
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,319
Hey, hey, what's going on with this guy?
Is he moving in, or what?

246
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,902
No. No, we're just dating.

247
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,411
You're just dating?

248
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,912
He's getting awfully
comfortable around here,

249
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,739
just bustling around the kitchen.

250
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,249
Back off, Clyde.

251
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,451
In his little antiseptic socks.

252
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,912
Yeah, well, at least he's present.

253
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,125
Excuse me?

254
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,664
You know, presence, attendance,

255
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,959
being in the moment,
as opposed to being absent.

256
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,042
Absent like you were the whole...

257
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,127
Stephanie, I know what it means.

258
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,757
- I was being a smart-ass.
- Just don't forget your stuff.

259
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,838
Yeah, fine.

260
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,466
<i>Hello?</i>

261
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,221
<i>- Clyde, it's Trevor.
- Hey.</i>

262
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,890
<i>Got your plane ticket lined up,</i>

263
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,967
<i>and I'm going to have
the university send a car,</i>

264
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,222
<i>pick you up when you land.</i>

265
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,394
Oh, you're rolling out the welcome.

266
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,562
<i>You're going to love it.</i>

267
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,060
Okay. Yeah, all right.
Well, thank you for calling.

268
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,983
Keep me informed, all right? Bye.

269
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,731
So she's in the middle row.

270
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,608
Hey, Dad, you know Hannah's
big dance performance

271
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,688
next week?
- Oh!

272
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,236
It's her first time in
front of a real audience.

273
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,114
- That's cool.
- Are you going to make it?

274
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,161
Heck, yes, I'm coming.

275
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,994
Mom will be there, so don't
feel obligated or anything.

276
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,203
Are you kidding me?

277
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm going to be sitting in the front row.

278
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,663
What's this in your mouth?

279
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,748
Hannah, I told you your teeth were perfect.

280
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,299
No, you said it was my decision,

281
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,814
and I decided that
I don't want to go through life disfigured.

282
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,338
Disfigured?
Who said your teeth were disfigured?

283
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,758
I did. I'm totally disfigured.
It's horrible.

284
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,135
You are perfect.

285
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,942
Hannah.

286
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,035
- Dad!
- What is it? What's wrong?

287
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,701
Go back outside.

288
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,781
Is there someone in the house?

289
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,537
- Shh. Go.

290
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,392
Who's there?

291
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,912
Dad?

292
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,991
It's okay, you guys.
I think we have a raccoon.

293
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,675
Emily.

294
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,429
Emily.

295
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,435
Emily.

296
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,781
Emily.

297
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,131
Em, breakfast is ready!

298
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,304
Ace!

299
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,517
Can't you hear me yelling for you?

300
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,718
Breakfast is ready.

301
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,031
Em.

302
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,492
What's wrong, Daddy?

303
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,245
First the announcer
comes out and he announces us,

304
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,668
and he's got, like,
the most obnoxious voice ever.

305
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,416
I don't know why they don't let me do it.

306
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,089
And he goes, like, "Make some noise"

307
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:21,260
"for the most dazzling divas of dance,
who always keep it fierce,"

308
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,633
"the Silverstars!"

309
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,218
And we all have
to wear our hair in a ponytail

310
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,423
so that we look the same,

311
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,851
because we're, like, the chorus and whatnot
with the can-can, so...

312
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,099
And I told Jen not to get her haircut,
because now it's too short

313
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,350
and her mom's making her get extensions...

314
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,646
Em, slow down.

315
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,271
And they use real human hair,
like, Indian and Asian hair.

316
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,527
I personally think that
that's really gross.

317
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,603
Em...

318
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,190
They sweep the hair
into these bins and then they weigh them,

319
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,076
and then they take them
to the special place

320
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,782
where they maneuver them
into, like, these wigs, and...

321
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,199
Em, slow down!

322
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,621
I'm sorry, Daddy! I'm sorry, Daddy!

323
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,264
- I'm really sorry!
- Go to your room.

324
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,962
What? Hannah, what happened?

325
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,468
In there!

326
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,804
Oh, my God.

327
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,281
My God.

328
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,657
Em? Stay there, Hannah.

329
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,837
Close the door. Close it!

330
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,844
Are you storing
any large amounts of fabrics,

331
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,520
cotton, silk, somewhere in the house?

332
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,938
Come on, man, you got to be kidding me.

333
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,653
I don't want
to be in that house any more.

334
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,402
Yeah, I know. Look, it's just moths.

335
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,435
Moths are like butterflies without colors.

336
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,702
Hey. are you okay?

337
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,450
What happened?

338
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,794
Creepy.

339
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,466
I had no idea that
moths were attracted to pizza and soda.

340
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,715
The pest control guy said
they can take care of it.

341
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,889
I'm still getting your
email on my computer.

342
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,639
- Want me to take care of it?
- Yes, please.

343
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,230
- How was Wagner?
- It was good. Interesting.

344
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,157
"Interesting."

345
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,661
You know, "interesting" is Stephanie code
for you fell asleep.

346
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,072
- No, I didn't.
- You totally fell asleep.

347
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,740
I didn't fall asleep.

348
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,169
Okay, I don't know what this file is.

349
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,751
What am I doing?

350
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,840
Don't you remember that?

351
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,344
That was the weekend
that the kids were in camp, remember?

352
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,095
<i>- Good morning.</i>
<i>- Good morning.</i>

353
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,972
<i>Did you sleep okay?</i>

354
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,016
<i>I did. It's a little hot in this house.</i>

355
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,928
Oh, I do remember.

356
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:42,979
No.

357
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,691
What are you doing?

358
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,357
That was a weekend.

359
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,442
That was a weekend.

360
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,111
Oh, Lord.

361
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,488
Nice legs, I'll give you that.

362
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,867
Oh, God.

363
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,127
Remember when...

364
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,459
- What?
- Nothing. Never mind.

365
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,630
Okay.

366
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,429
All right, there you go.

367
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,137
I am successfully deleted
from your computer.

368
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,144
Thank you.

369
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,646
I've been meaning to ask you.

370
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,152
Have you...

371
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,229
Have you noticed
anything odd going on with Emily?

372
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,489
Like what?

373
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,321
I don't know. She...

374
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,601
She has these moments where
she just kind of checks out.

375
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,157
We've...
We've disrupted their whole lives.

376
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:47,248
It's going to be a while before anything's
normal again, right?

377
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,008
Yeah.

378
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,475
- Okay. I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

379
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,976
Thank you.

380
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,236
Where's the communication?

381
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,688
I don't hear anything out here.

382
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,485
You going to pass it?

383
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,905
No, you're going to shoot it.

384
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,786
Put 20 minutes on the clock.

385
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,365
We're going to run a
full half of basketball.

386
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,916
If I don't see some hustle,

387
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,538
we're all going to stay late and run lines.

388
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,960
Let's go. Let's move.

389
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,213
Hey, Coach, didn't you say
you had to be somewhere at 5:00?

390
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,881
- What time is it?
- Past that.

391
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:40,222
<i>Make some noise
for the most dazzling divas of dance</i>

392
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,304
who always bring it fierce,

393
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,057
the Silverstars!

394
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,910
<i>Hannah, I'm so sorry
I missed your performance.</i>

395
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,791
I screwed up.

396
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,164
I promise you I'm going
to make it up to you.

397
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,170
<i>She's mad at you.</i>

398
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,375
Yeah, I know.

399
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,051
Is my box all right?

400
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,592
It's fine.

401
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,757
<i>I don't want you going near it.</i>

402
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,223
Okay.

403
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,430
<i>Because I'm the only one
allowed to touch it.</i>

404
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,103
Hey, Em, what's the deal with the box?

405
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,271
<i>Just don't touch it, okay?</i>

406
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,450
Okay. I won't.

407
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,955
<i>- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, baby girl.</i>

408
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,234
What the hell is this?

409
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,968
What's in this?

410
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,671
Give it back!

411
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,471
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

412
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,937
Give it back to me!

413
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,190
No!

414
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,986
Emily has displayed some
unusual behavior in the past few weeks.

415
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,951
She is becoming distant from her friends,

416
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,536
not doing her assignments.

417
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,039
She seems to have lost interest in things

418
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,039
that were once so important to her.

419
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,502
Well, Em's been going through a lot lately.

420
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,340
- You moved recently.
- Yeah, I moved.

421
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:33,640
Stephanie has the girls at the same house

422
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,036
they grew up in most of the time.

423
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,518
How are things
in your new home?

424
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,977
Things are fine.
Fine, given the circumstances.

425
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,728
Circumstances?

426
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:47,397
We're divorced.
That's always tough on the kids, isn't it?

427
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:52,785
I think it would benefit Emily
to talk to someone about her feelings.

428
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,202
Feelings? I...

429
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,158
I talk to her about her
feelings all the time.

430
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,412
About everything.

431
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,125
Still,
she seems extremely frustrated.

432
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,083
She scared everybody
with that box, Mrs. Brenek.

433
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,922
A little time away from
it will do her good.

434
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,801
That just doesn't sound like Emily at all.

435
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,974
I mean, she's never gotten
into a fight, ever.

436
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,596
This wasn't just a fight.

437
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,894
This was violent.

438
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,773
We've been separated for over a year

439
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,145
and the kids have never had an issue.

440
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,107
This weird behavior, there's
something else going on here.

441
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,280
Yeah, maybe she's insecure, you know?

442
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,359
Maybe she's afraid
you're not going to be there for her.

443
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,239
Still getting your email.

444
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,946
It's your flight confirmation
for North Carolina.

445
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,871
- I was going to tell you about this.
- When? After you took the job?

446
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,623
It's just to sit down and talk.

447
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,293
If they offer it to you,
you going to take it?

448
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,876
- Of course you are.
- Stephanie, wait.

449
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,053
Of course you are.
Anything to be a big shot again.

450
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,381
Meanwhile, your 10-year-old
girl's falling apart.

451
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,636
Em's behavior's got
nothing to do with this.

452
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,593
Great. Stay oblivious, Clyde.

453
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,394
It seems to be working well for you.

454
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,595
- Oh, come on.

455
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,145
You gotta be kidding me.

456
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,485
Hey! Stay away from my kid's teeth.

457
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,734
Oh, no.

458
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,978
So, Em, do you understand why
school was canceled today?

459
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,317
Because Miss Shandy's dead.

460
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,577
That's right. She was
in a horrible accident last night.

461
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,989
Can you get my box for me?
It's still in the classroom.

462
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:38,127
Let's... Let's talk
about this for a second, okay.

463
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,131
Why is the box so important to you?

464
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,635
Don't know. Just is.

465
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,313
Okay.

466
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,517
Um, you know, Emily,

467
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,323
I noticed that sometimes you talk to it.

468
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,483
I do not talk to the box.

469
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,827
I talk to my friend.

470
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,157
- Your friend?
- What?

471
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,205
- You said you talk to your friend.
- Mmm-hmm.

472
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,665
The one who lives in the box.

473
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,873
Your friend lives inside the box?

474
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,334
- What?
- He lives in there?

475
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,842
It's a she. A woman.

476
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,682
What exactly does she say to you, Emily?

477
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,897
That I'm special.

478
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,562
Well, you know, you are very special.

479
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,656
You know, I'd sure like to meet her.

480
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,698
Not possible. No one can see her.

481
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,079
Not even me.

482
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,712
Can I have some more?

483
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,714
She's still hungry.

484
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,254
Where's my box?

485
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,090
I got rid of it, Em.

486
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,935
Tell me where it is.

487
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,104
It's not here.

488
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,937
Then go get it.

489
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,102
We're done with the box, Emily.

490
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,616
- I'm calling Morn.
- And tell her what?

491
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,197
- To come pick me up.
- That's not happening.

492
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,699
And if you keep talking to me like this,

493
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,951
you're going to be grounded
the rest of the weekend.

494
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,832
I hate you.

495
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,168
Go to your room.
That's it. Go to your room.

496
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,673
I don't love you.

497
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,636
- Emily...
- And Mommy doesn't love you.

498
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,344
You think
you know everything, but you don't.

499
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,600
You better knock it off. Stop it right now.

500
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,352
Mommy loves Brett now.

501
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,095
He makes her happy.

502
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,431
You don't talk to your father this way.

503
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,814
He does nice things for her!
Something you never did.

504
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,067
- Ow! Daddy!

505
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,944
- What are...
- What are you doing to me?

506
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,483
Daddy?

507
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,870
What are you... Emily!

508
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,999
What are you doing to me, Daddy?

509
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,661
- What are you doing, Dad?
- I'm not doing anything!

510
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,999
Did you just hit her?

511
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,320
No, damn it, I didn't hit her!

512
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,373
Emily!

513
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,843
Em! We need to talk.

514
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,030
Emily!

515
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:33,699
Em!

516
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,614
Em!

517
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,365
Em!

518
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,851
There...

519
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,852
Are you my friend from the box?

520
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,400
No. No.

521
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:01,374
Because my dad doesn't...

522
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,247
My dad doesn't like me any more.

523
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,586
No.

524
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,134
What are you talking about?

525
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,513
No!

526
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,475
No! No!

527
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,198
Em!

528
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,623
Right.

529
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,208
No, I gotta go.

530
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,582
Judge Simmons has reviewed everything

531
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,456
and is granting the
interim temporary order.

532
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,216
So I can't see my kids?

533
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,720
Based on Mrs. Brenek's report
about the bruise marks...

534
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,464
Stephanie, this is ridiculous.

535
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,140
You know I would never hit her.

536
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,637
Judge Simmons will schedule
a full hearing.

537
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:43,718
We'll be in touch with the court date.

538
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,802
Thank you.

539
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,221
- Wait. Wait, Stephanie.
- Mr. Brenek!

540
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,227
Can we talk? Just the two of us?

541
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,979
We can work this out, Stephanie.

542
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,235
Mr. Brenek! You can state your case at...

543
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,234
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to my wife!

544
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,989
- Steph...
- Don't you touch me!

545
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:01,236
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?

546
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,743
You destroyed this family,

547
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,665
but I won't let you hurt the children.

548
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:11,921
Just move.

549
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,423
Just move to North Carolina.

550
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,843
I don't want to see you again.

551
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,273
<i>He's clearly unstable.
He's angry and he's confused</i>

552
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,685
and he's taking this divorce
out on everyone around him.

553
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:34,860
And it's the girls that
are paying the price.

554
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,620
That's why Em's having such a hard time.

555
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,273
Listen, I brought a stack
of DVDs from my collection.

556
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,610
I thought maybe we'd have
a little movie night with the girls.

557
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,786
That's a great idea.

558
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,321
Watch something funny.

559
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,326
Let's lighten the mood
around here a little bit.

560
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,950
Okay.

561
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,544
That's your second glass.
Save a little for dinner?

562
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,743
Hey!

563
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,175
What you got there?

564
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,010
What you got in your hand? Come on.

565
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,439
Can I see it?

566
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,687
Honey, it's okay. Let me see it.

567
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,697
Come on.

568
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,867
Where'd you get this?

569
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,494
<i>Where'd you get this, Em?</i>

570
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,629
It's deliberate...

571
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:34,847
Em?

572
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,143
Em?

573
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,407
I think you should leave.

574
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,492
I think you should leave now.

575
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,123
I don't like you!

576
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,679
Well, you're just going to have to
get used to that, aren't you?

577
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,134
Coach, you looking for the bathroom?

578
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,850
What brings you to my class?

579
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,857
Quite a find, Clyde.

580
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,528
That's just it.
I have no idea what I've got here.

581
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,886
Well, judging by the woodwork,

582
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,782
I'd say it was from Poland, 1920s, '30s.

583
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,535
Probably originated in a Jewish village,

584
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,956
indicated by these Hebrew inscriptions.

585
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:40,042
I think it says, "Dibbuk."

586
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,959
It's the Hebrew word for
"dislocated spirit."

587
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,798
It's a dibbuk box.

588
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,135
So was it used for something religious?

589
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,971
The more traditional branches of Judaism,

590
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,052
especially in the Hasidic sects,

591
00:50:55,135 --> 00:51:00,733
believe in various spirits,
both benevolent and...

592
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,986
- Benevolent and...
- Evil. Like demons.

593
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,826
A dibbuk box was made with the belief

594
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,701
that the evil itself could
somehow be contained.

595
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,370
Think of it.

596
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:22,539
If you believed such a thing,
that you could trap a demon.

597
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:29,587
And now, it's in your hands, Coach Brenek.

598
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,423
Carrying around this curse.

599
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,261
Whoo... Very brave man.

600
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:42,438
Whoever made this box
certainly had intense convictions.

601
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,692
It's why they concealed this
lock and carved these words.

602
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,699
Basically what they're saying is...

603
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,030
"Warning. Deadly."

604
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,120
"Do not open."

605
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,370
So, don't open it.

606
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,721
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Where's your sister?

607
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:11,818
Mom's at the drug store.

608
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,114
She'd freak if she knew you were here.

609
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,033
Hannah, I'm not
screwing around. I need to see Emily.

610
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,283
She decided to stay home.
She's not feeling well.

611
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,954
Dad!

612
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,296
Em.

613
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,315
"Whoever sits in the refuge
of the most high,"

614
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,489
"he shall dwell in the
shade of the Almighty."

615
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,610
"I will say of Hashem,"

616
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,246
"He is my refuge, my fortress, my God."

617
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,666
"I will trust in Him."

618
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,913
"For He will deliver you
from the ensnaring trap"

619
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,340
"from devastating pestilence..."

620
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,726
"With his pinion He will cover you,"

621
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,270
"and beneath His wings
you will be protected."

622
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,228
"His truth is shield..."

623
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:36,528
"His truth is shield and armor."

624
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,945
"You shall not fear the
terror of night, nor..."

625
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,881
Who are you?

626
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,549
What do you want with my little girl?

627
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,807
You tell me!

628
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,268
What do you want?

629
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,688
You tell me!

630
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,564
Clyde!

631
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,230
What are you doing in here? Get out!

632
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,900
Get out of the house!
I'll call the police. Get out!

633
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,644
What are you doing?

634
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,733
Excuse me.

635
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,485
Sorry.

636
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,904
I get kind of lost when I'm listening.

637
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:42,571
My name's Clyde Brenek.
I'm looking for Tzadok Shapir.

638
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,992
Yeah, that's me.

639
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,113
- We talked on the phone.
- Thank you for meeting me.

640
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,324
Is that it?

641
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,452
Yeah.

642
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,418
All right.

643
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,046
I'll take you
to see my father, the Rebbe Shapir,

644
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,007
but I must tell you, he's traditional.

645
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,555
Okay.

646
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,842
All right. Everyone's waiting in the shul.

647
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,070
Amen.

648
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,716
My father asks if you could
show us what's in the bag.

649
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:07,201
Rebbe Shapir wants to know
where you got this.

650
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,741
I bought it at a yard sale.

651
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,951
Did you open it?

652
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:18,788
Tell us, did you open the box?

653
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,046
- My daughter...

654
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,502
My daughter opened it.

655
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,719
What does this thing want
with my daughter?

656
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,104
The dibbuk
looks for innocence. A pure soul.

657
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,989
It will move back and forth from the box,

658
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,566
searching for a proper host.

659
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:52,409
The host begins to hear
voices, experience visions.

660
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,541
All of this is the deception of the spirit

661
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,960
to protect the host and drive others away.

662
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:04,086
<i>The final stage is when the
dibbuk attaches to the host,</i>

663
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,293
<i>the two becoming one.</i>

664
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,927
<i>It will feed and take
until there is nothing left.</i>

665
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:16,103
It wants only one thing,
that which it does not have.

666
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,184
Leiben.

667
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,144
Life.

668
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,277
It's taking my daughter's life.

669
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,324
How do I stop it?

670
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,706
The only way to stop the dibbuk

671
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:45,500
is by commanding it back
into the box by its name.

672
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,342
I don't have its name.

673
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:52,515
This is what I have. I need your help.

674
00:59:56,301 --> 01:00:00,306
I saw this ceremony, an exorcism.

675
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,474
It is too great of a risk.

676
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,903
The dibbuk could come upon anyone
attempting to perform the ceremony.

677
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,655
No.

678
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,826
No, wait. Wait, please.

679
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,331
Someone here has to help me.

680
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,702
It's not my little girl any more.

681
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:25,881
When I look into her eyes,
it's this thing looking back at me.

682
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:32,380
But my little girl, Emily,
she's in there, right?

683
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,383
Please tell me she's in there.

684
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,891
You have to help me.

685
01:00:55,569 --> 01:01:00,245
This must be left to the will of God.

686
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,417
The will of God?

687
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,841
If this were your child,

688
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,093
would you leave it to the will of God?

689
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:39,788
Mr. Brenek?

690
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,999
I'm coming with you.

691
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:44,618
Why?

692
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,006
<i>Pikuach nefesh.</i>
A permitted violation of a Shabbat law.

693
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,796
A human life is in danger.

694
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,969
I am not only allowed, but required to act.

695
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,806
Let's go.

696
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:25,765
Em...

697
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,940
What are you doing?

698
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,726
Emma...

699
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,274
Give me that, sweetie.

700
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,247
Emily, what are you doing?

701
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,085
Em's not here!

702
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,253
It's okay, baby. Come here. Come here.

703
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,757
You just stop this right now.
Come here. Come to Mommy.

704
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,262
No!

705
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,965
I'm not playing games now.

706
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,474
Emily.

707
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:08,637
I said, Em's not here!

708
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,104
Emily, come here, honey.

709
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:28,957
Em, where are you?

710
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,626
Emily, come here, baby.

711
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,843
Come here.

712
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,478
Em, where are you?

713
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,366
Em?

714
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,044
Emily?

715
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,550
Where are you?

716
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,678
Mom, who am I?

717
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,231
Oh, baby...

718
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,359
Who am I, Mommy?

719
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,871
Her face.

720
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,367
You should have seen it.

721
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,878
I was actually scared.

722
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,880
I've never seen anything like that.

723
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,296
You know, with everything that's going on,

724
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,632
I think we need to have her see someone.

725
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,971
I called a friend of mine.
She's a mental health specialist.

726
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,646
She works with kids all the time.

727
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,802
She said she can see Em
first thing tomorrow morning.

728
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,152
Spend a couple of days giving her a
full evaluation at her facility.

729
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,654
Okay.

730
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,407
You can tell Em that we're just going away
for the weekend.

731
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:53,268
Okay, everybody, let's go!

732
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,606
Emily?

733
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,491
Brett?

734
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,291
You Okay?

735
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,041
Em?

736
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,338
Em?

737
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,380
- Hannah!
- What's going on?

738
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,589
Call 911!

739
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,678
Just...

740
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,548
What's wrong with her, Mom?
What's wrong with her?

741
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,364
There has to be a name.

742
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,695
I don't know. I've searched
every inch of that thing.

743
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,288
The carvings, a prayer
from the Book of Psalms,

744
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,866
the tokens placed inside,

745
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,743
but why is there this mirror?

746
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,958
If the spirit was contained,

747
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,711
it would have to look upon itself,

748
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:50,127
to be forever reminded
that it turned away from God.

749
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:52,971
Jesus.

750
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:03,224
"Abyzou."

751
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,234
Abyzou.

752
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,404
"Taker of children."

753
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,907
Hurry.

754
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,420
I'd like to schedule an MRI right away.

755
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,751
Okay.

756
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:32,210
<i>Emily, we're going to slide you
into this machine here.</i>

757
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,012
<i>Just think of it as a great big camera.</i>

758
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,385
<i>Lets us take a look inside.</i>

759
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,887
- Am I okay?
- Yeah, baby. Yeah.

760
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,724
Everything's going to be all right.
Don't be afraid, okay.

761
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,226
We're going to be in the other room. Okay?

762
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:46,433
You'll hear some noises, Emily.

763
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,230
It's nothing to be scared of.

764
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,483
I love you.

765
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,610
I need you to stay very, very still for me.

766
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,410
All right, here we go.

767
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,596
- Can I close my eyes?
<i>- Of course.</i>

768
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,095
<i>We're going to start taking pictures now.</i>

769
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,147
Looking good. Good tissue.

770
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,953
<i>Doing great, Emily.</i>

771
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,136
There must be some interference.

772
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,693
What's happening?
Is she all right in there by herself?

773
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,774
- She's fine.
- Get somebody up here

774
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,017
who knows what they're doing.

775
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,106
What's going on?

776
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,231
Things like this
will happen once in a while.

777
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,384
Oh, my God.

778
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,885
There's something in there with her!

779
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:15,623
Hey.

780
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,384
Hi.

781
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,046
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
- No.

782
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:38,237
I saw something...

783
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,612
I saw something in her.

784
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:49,581
The doctors, they can't help us, can they?

785
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,327
Just, I need you to trust me, okay?

786
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,876
Are you able to get her out?

787
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,550
No. We're going to have to do it here.

788
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,626
Here?

789
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,763
Great.

790
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,844
I hate hospitals. People die here.

791
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,152
Hey.

792
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,900
This is Tzadok. Tzadok, this is my family.

793
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,072
Thank you for coming.

794
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,158
- Can you help us?
- Of course.

795
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,209
What do I look like, a doctor?

796
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,390
It doesn't want me here.
We need a private place.

797
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,207
- Thank you.

798
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,713
There's a physical therapy room down there.
My players use it sometimes.

799
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,886
No one uses it after 6:00.

800
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,560
Oh, baby.

801
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,395
Take these candles and light them.

802
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,196
- How many?
- Seven.

803
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:53,868
As the others have
done in the past, I have asked you

804
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,668
to put something
from your heart in the box.

805
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,335
It is believed that this
essence will bind the prayer.

806
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,996
This belonged to my grandfather.

807
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,836
The strength of my entire
family is with us.

808
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,584
Hannah? Honey?

809
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,255
Stephanie.

810
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,263
Your wedding ring.

811
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,765
Once we begin,
we must complete the ceremony.

812
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,555
The dibbuk will
do everything it can to stop us.

813
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:18,639
No, baby.

814
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,893
Even in the face of this evil,
our faith must remain unwavering.

815
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,936
- Okay.
- Please, God.

816
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:28,112
Oil of two olive trees.
Oil represents light.

817
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,651
Water represents darkness.

818
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,033
May God separate between these two

819
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:35,615
as only light can dispel darkness.

820
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,847
"Nor the destruction that ravages at noon."

821
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,845
"Put Your hands on her."

822
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,177
"You need only look with Your"

823
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,104
"and the punishment
of the wicked illuminator."

824
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:11,822
Shut up!

825
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:17,456
You take me! Take me!

826
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,204
Everybody, put your hands on her!

827
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,382
Cast all fear from your hearts!

828
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,005
Emily!

829
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,514
You die!

830
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,182
Emily!

831
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,227
Daddy!

832
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,064
You let my daughter go! Take me!

833
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,573
You take me instead!

834
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,322
No!

835
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,742
That is no longer your daughter!

836
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,251
Clyde!

837
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,223
Em?

838
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,534
Em?

839
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,230
Daddy, you scared me.

840
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,579
Daddy, you scared me.

841
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,754
Daddy, you scared me.

842
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,304
Daddy, you scared me.

843
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,728
Daddy, you scare me.

844
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,856
- Dad, you scare me.

845
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:29,023
Take me!
You take me instead!

846
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:32,985
Em!

847
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,237
Clyde?

848
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,076
Daddy?

849
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,795
Em, is that you?

850
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,471
Clyde!

851
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,071
Daddy?

852
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:24,449
- Is it okay? Okay?
- Em...

853
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,988
Oh, thank God.

854
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:28,699
Not right.

855
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,043
This is all wrong.

856
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,538
Guys, this is not right.

857
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,714
Where is it?

858
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,217
Where's the dibbuk?

859
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,470
Abyzou.

860
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:46,137
Abyzou. Abyzou.

861
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,435
Abyzou!

862
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,060
Abyzou!

863
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:53,598
Abyzou!

864
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:01,273
Abyzou!

865
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:07,904
Abyzou!

866
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:17,423
Abyzou!

867
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,213
Abyzou!

868
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,464
Clyde!

869
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,596
Hannah!

870
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,299
Daddy!

871
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,649
No! No!

872
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:36,809
Emily!

873
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:46,202
I say to you that
He will save you from the ensnaring trap!

874
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,454
He will instruct His angels in your behalf

875
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:51,203
to guard you in all your ways.

876
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:59,879
I say to you
in the name of God, leave this flesh!

877
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:03,298
Abyzou!

878
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,933
I say to the Lord,
my God in whom I trust,

879
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,804
He will save you from
the destruction and pestilence.

880
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:21,603
Abyzou!

881
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,786
You are cast away from the eyes of God!

882
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:37,953
Daddy!

883
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:38,536
Abyzou!

884
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,423
Abyzou!

885
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,142
Hannah?

886
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,730
Daddy...

887
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,361
It's okay.

888
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:27,479
Hi.

889
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:16,578
Oh, it's just a cough.

890
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:31,756
Tzadok, hey! I...
I'm calling to say thank you.

891
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:34,467
Clyde! I was going to call.

892
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,014
Figure out how to get your car back to you.

893
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:39,177
<i>You keep it.
I am not going to be going anywhere.</i>

894
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,645
<i>How's the family?</i>

895
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,226
<i>Perfect. More than perfect.</i>

896
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:46,483
<i>So what are you going to do with it?</i>

897
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:47,559
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

898
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,478
<i>I'm going to speak with my father.</i>

899
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,983
<i>We'll find a safe place for it.</i>

900
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,195
<i>Okay. Goodbye, Tzadok.</i>

901
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,701
<i>Goodbye, Clyde.</i>
