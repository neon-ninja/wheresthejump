1
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,669
Never did eat your lunch, did ya?

2
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,806
I'd better
get back to the office.

3
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,876
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,923
Why don't you call your boss and
tell him to take the afternoon off.

5
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,425
It's Friday, anyway.
Huh?

6
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,428
Yeah? What do I do
with my free afternoon?

7
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,430
Walk you to the airport and--

8
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,934
Laze around here a while longer.

9
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,936
Checking out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,441
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in when you come in,

11
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,943
but when your time's up--

12
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,917
I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,919
I have to go.

14
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,525
I can come down next week.

15
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,822
No.

16
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,126
Not even just to see you,
have lunch? In public.

17
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,634
Oh, we can see each other.
We can have dinner.

18
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,638
But respectably.

19
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,643
In my house, with my mother's picture
on the mantel,

20
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,646
my sister helping me
to broil a steak for three.

21
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,773
I'd kinda like to
meet your sister.

22
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,850
She, um--

23
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,852
She look anything like you?

24
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,820
- Sam.
- No?

25
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,323
All right.

26
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,326
Marion, whenever possible
I want to see you,

27
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,330
and under any conditions,

28
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,298
even, uh, respectability.

29
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,527
You make respectability
sound so disrespectful.

30
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,625
No, I'm all for it.

31
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,530
Look, a couple years, I'll have
my father's debts paid off at the store.

32
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,043
And I told you, alimony stops as soon
as she gets married again.

33
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,444
Ohh. I haven't even been
married once yet.

34
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,041
Yeah, but when you do,
you'll swing.

35
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,388
So, let's get married.

36
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,756
You really wanna live
in a hardware store in Fairvale,
eat beans out of a can with me?

37
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,489
- Oh?
- Yeah, that'd be a lot of laughs.

38
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,532
Tell you what--
When I send my ex-wife her money,

39
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,169
you can lick the stamps.

40
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,535
I'll lick the stamps.

41
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,842
Marion, you wanna cut this off,

42
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,437
go out and find yourself someone
who's, uh, available?

43
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,446
I'm thinkin' of it.

44
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,844
Don't you go break my heart, now.

45
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,584
Don't miss your plane.

46
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,682
Hey, wait.
We can leave together, can't we?

47
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,557
I'm late, and you have
to put your shoes on.

48
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,869
Is Mr. Lowery
back from lunch yet?

49
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,872
He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris St. property.

50
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,875
- You know, the oil lease man?
- Right, right, right.

51
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,377
So, that's why he's late.

52
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,379
You getting a headache?

53
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,381
It'll pass.

54
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,385
Headaches are like resolutions..
You forget about 'em
as soon as they stop hurting.

55
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,614
You got aspirins?

56
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,489
I have something.
Not aspirins, but--

57
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,994
My mother's doctor gave these to me
on the day of my wedding.

58
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,089
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

59
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,134
Any calls?

60
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,138
Oh, Teddy called me, and my mother
called to see if Teddy called.

61
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,437
And, oh, your sister called to say she'd
be going to Tucson to do some buying...

62
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,034
and she'd be gone
the whole weekend, and--

63
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,113
Whoo!

64
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,115
Hot as fresh milk.

65
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,118
You girls oughta get your boss
to turn on the air-conditioning.

66
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,916
He can afford it today.

67
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,219
Marion, will you get those copies
of the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

68
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,919
- Of course.
- Tomorrow's the day.

69
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,423
What a sweet little girl.

70
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,228
- Not you, darlin'. My daughter.
- Oh.

71
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:54,739
She's my baby, but tomorrow she stands
up there and gets married away from me.

72
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,776
Here, I'd like you
to have a look at my baby.

73
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,845
Eighteen years old,

74
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,552
and never known an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

75
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,782
Come on, Tom.
The air conditioner's on in my office.

76
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,153
You know what I do
with unhappiness?

77
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,158
I buy it off.

78
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,491
- You unhappy?
- Oh, not inordinately, no.

79
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,498
Oh.

80
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,870
I'm buyin' this house
as a wedding present for my baby.

81
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,895
Now, that's not buyin' happiness.

82
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,906
That's buyin' off unhappiness, see?

83
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,737
Yes, sir.

84
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,507
Four hundred thousand dollars, cash.

85
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,139
Not to worry, now.

86
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,707
I never carry more than I can afford
to lose. Count 'em up.

87
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,516
- I declare!
- I don't.

88
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,647
That's how I'm able to keep it.

89
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:49,525
Tom, uh, cash transactions of this size,
uh-- most irregular.

90
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,725
Yeah, well, so what?
It's my private money. Now it's yours.

91
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,233
Suppose we just
put this in the safe,

92
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,238
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good--

93
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,333
Speaking of feeling good,
what happened to that bottle
you said you had in your desk?

94
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,645
Mmm.

95
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:13,344
You know, sometimes I can
keep my mouth shut.

96
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,547
Lowery, I'm dyin'
of thirst-a-roonie here.

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,861
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

98
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,057
Put it the safe deposit box
at the bank.

99
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,363
- We'll get him to give us
a check on Monday instead.
- Okay.

100
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,765
Oh! Ahh.

101
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,281
He was flirting with you.

102
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,417
Guess he must have noticed
my wedding ring.

103
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,489
Uh-huh.

104
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,492
Lowery.

105
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,897
Come in.

106
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,035
- The copies.
- Thank you.

107
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,038
If you don't mind, I'd like to go
right on home after the bank.

108
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,041
- l-I'm feeling a slight headache.
- You go ahead on home.

109
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,011
Me and your boss are gonna go out and
get ourselves a little drinkin' done.

110
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,014
Of course.
Do you feel ill?

111
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,516
Oh, it's just--
just a little headache.

112
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,248
You need a weekend in Las Vegas.
Playground of the world.

113
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,415
I'm gonna spend the weekend in bed.
Thank you.

114
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,551
Only playground
to beat Las Vegas.

115
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,020
Mmm.

116
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,686
Marion, what--
what are you doin' up here?

117
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,693
Where in the world did you get
all that money?

118
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:14,129
Y eah. It's more than I need
to get out of debt.

119
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,067
So I said, "Sandy,

120
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,472
you see anything there you haven't
at least had a fifth of before?"

121
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,477
Sandy looks all up and down--

122
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,910
Sandy looks all up and down the bar,
and he says, "No."

123
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,663
5-27, you comin' in 10-1?

124
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,364
5-31, try again in your new location.

125
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,082
21-13, are you available
for check five duty?

126
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,583
Hold it right there.

127
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,256
- In quite a hurry.
- Y es.

128
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,228
I-I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

129
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,562
I almost had an accident last night
from, from, uh, sleepiness,

130
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,125
so I decided to pull over.

131
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,661
- You slept here all night?
- Y es.

132
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,708
As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open, so--

133
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,108
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've--

134
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,738
I mean, just to be safe.

135
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,251
- I just pulled over.
Have I broken any laws?
- No, ma'am.

136
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,811
- Then I'm free to go?
- Is anything wrong?

137
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,824
There's nothing wrong,

138
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,827
except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

139
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,829
Now, just a moment.

140
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,559
Turn your motor off, please.

141
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,536
May I see your license
and registration?

142
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,439
- Why?
- Please.

143
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,202
Have a nice day.

144
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,599
Hey, Larry!
How soon do you want this?

145
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,301
Pick up line one.

146
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,607
It's about time.

147
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,598
O.B.'s working on that.

148
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,944
Be with you in a second!

149
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,069
5-28, was that Victor-Charlie-Bravo?

150
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,869
5-28, 10-4.
Victor-Charlie-Bravo.

151
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,518
I'm in no mood for trouble.

152
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,520
What?

153
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,523
There's an old saying
that the first customer of the day...

154
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,525
is always the most trouble.

155
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,528
But I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna
treat you so fair and square...

156
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,030
you're not gonna have
one human reason--

157
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,533
Can I trade in my car
and take another?

158
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,037
You can do anything you have a mind to.
Bein' a woman, you will.

159
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,039
- Is that yours?
- Yes. Yes.

160
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,702
- There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm just--
- Sick of the sight of it.

161
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,941
Well, have a look around, see if there's
anything that strikes your eye.

162
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,109
Meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

163
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,812
I was just about to make some coffee.
You want some--

164
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,652
No, I'm in a hurry. I just wanna make
the change and start--

165
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:16,160
A person ought not to be in a hurry,
but it's too nice a day to argue.

166
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,163
So, I'll just shoot your car
in the garage.

167
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,165
O.B.!

168
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,234
Y eah, boss?

169
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,042
- What's up?
- Can you take this one,
give it the once-over?

170
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,011
Sure. No problem.
I'll give it the standard.

171
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,316
Say, that's the one
I'd have picked for you myself.

172
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,818
- How much?
- Go ahead. Spin it around.

173
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,048
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it looks fine.

174
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,920
How much will it be
with my car?

175
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,425
- You don't want the usual
day-and-a-half to think it over?
- No.

176
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,157
- You are in a hurry.
Somebody chasin' ya?
- Well, of course not.

177
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,166
Please.

178
00:18:55,234 --> 00:19:00,331
Well, that's the first time I ever saw
the customer high-pressure the salesman.

179
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,432
But I figure, uh, roughly,

180
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,340
your car plus...

181
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,175
four thousand?

182
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,841
Four thousand.
Four thousand.

183
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,444
Ah, you got time
to argue price, though, huh?

184
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,147
All right.
Four thousand dollars.

185
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:21,659
I take it, uh, you can prove that
that car is yours.

186
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,355
- I mean, out of state license and all.
- I have all the necessary papers.

187
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,956
- ls-- Is there a ladies' room?
- l-ln the building.

188
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,160
Thank you.

189
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,163
Hey!

190
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,600
Forgot your bag.

191
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,971
Put 'em in the back, please.

192
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,716
Heck, Officer, that was the first time
I ever saw the customer...

193
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,717
high-pressure the salesman.

194
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,719
Is somebody chasin' her?

195
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,722
I'd better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

196
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,191
- She look like a bad one to you?
- Acted like one.

197
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,685
Funny thing is,
she paid me in cash.

198
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,908
Y es, Mr. Lowery?

199
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,911
Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

200
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,608
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

201
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,915
Buzz me the minute she comes in.

202
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,615
Call her sister.
If no one's answering at the house--

203
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,625
I called her sister where she works--
Hard Core Vinyl Record Store.

204
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,628
She doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.

205
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,630
Run out to the house.

206
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,633
She may be unable to answer the phone.

207
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,932
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

208
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,340
No, I haven't
the faintest idea.

209
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,344
I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

210
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,849
She said she didn't feel well, wanted
to leave early and I said she could.

211
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,217
That was the last I saw--
Wait a minute.

212
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,222
I did see her some time later, driving.

213
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,919
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

214
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,122
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

215
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,597
Quick.

216
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,897
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $400,000.

217
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,905
I'll get it back,
and if any of it's missin'...

218
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,965
I'll replace it
with her fine, soft flesh.

219
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,977
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

220
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,673
A girl works for you for ten years,
you trust her.

221
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,683
It must be some kind of a mystery.
I can't--

222
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,686
Check with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her.

223
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,688
You still trust her?
Hot creepers, man.

224
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,691
She sat there while I dumped it out,
hardly even looked at it,

225
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,956
plannin', and even flirtin' with me.

226
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,395
You trust her.

227
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,634
Gee, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't hear you in all this rain.

228
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,645
Go on in, please.

229
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,609
- It's a dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

230
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,847
Oh, we have 12, in fact.

231
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,856
Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies.

232
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,951
They moved away the highway.

233
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,520
- Oh, I thought I had gotten
off the main road.
- I knew you must've.

234
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,534
No one ever stops here anymore
unless they've done that.

235
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,161
Oh.

236
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,172
Ah, but it's no use
dwelling on our losses.

237
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,041
We just keep on lightin' the lights
and following the formalities.

238
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,846
Uh, and, uh,
your home address.

239
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,249
Town will do.

240
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,648
Los Angeles.

241
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,062
Cabin one.

242
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,691
It's closer, in case you want anything.
Right next to the office.

243
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,964
Oh, I want sleep more than
anything else. Except maybe food.

244
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:16,463
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside Fairvale.

245
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,874
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles.

246
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,004
I'll get your bags for you.

247
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,235
Uh, it's stuffy in here.

248
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,604
Well, the mattress is soft,
and there's hangers in the closet,

249
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,613
and there's stationery
with "Bates Motel" written on it,

250
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,616
just in case you want to make
your friends back home envious.

251
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,515
Ah. Mmm.

252
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,712
And, um,

253
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,722
uh, the, uh--

254
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,125
Over there.

255
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,650
- The bathroom.
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,666
If you want anything at all just tap on
the wall, 'cause I'll be in the office.

257
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,532
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.
- Norman Bates.

258
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,573
- You have something
that most girls don't have.
- I have?

259
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:27,442
There's not a name for it, but it's
something that puts a person at ease.

260
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,581
Well, thank you again.

261
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,278
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to that diner, are you?

262
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,048
- No.
- Would you do me a favor, then?

263
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,056
Would you have dinner with me?
I was just about to myself.

264
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,887
Nothing special.
Just sandwiches and milk.

265
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,629
But I'd like it if you came up
to the house.

266
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:48,588
I don't set a fancy table or anything,
but, uh, the kitchen's awful homey.

267
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,338
- I'd like to.
- All right.

268
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,541
Well, then you get settled in,
take off your wet shoes...

269
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,544
and I'll be back
as soon as it's ready...

270
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,444
with my trusty umbrella.

271
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,822
No, I tell you! No!

272
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,121
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper.

273
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,217
By candlelight, I suppose,

274
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,264
in the cheap, erotic fashion
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

275
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,266
Mother, please!

276
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,268
And then what?

277
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,270
After supper, music?
Whispers?

278
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,636
Mother, she's just a stranger.

279
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,267
She's hungry,
and it's raining out.

280
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,244
"Mother, she was just a stranger."

281
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,747
As if men don't desire strangers.
As if--

282
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,249
Well, I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

283
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,252
Do you understand, boy?

284
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:54,951
Go on. Tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite
with my food or my son.

285
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,962
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

286
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,191
Shut up! Shut up!

287
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,699
Shut up!

288
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,237
I've caused you
some trouble.

289
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:43,537
No, uh, Mother--
my mother--

290
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,541
Oh, what's the phrase?

291
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,511
She isn't quite herself today.

292
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,349
Well, you shouldn't
have bothered.

293
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,353
I-I really don't have that much
of an appetite.

294
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,355
Uh, I'm sorry.

295
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,324
I wish I could apologize
for other people.

296
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,327
Don't worry about it.

297
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,334
Well, as long as
you've fixed us supper,

298
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,030
we might as well eat it, huh?

299
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,778
It might be nicer and warmer...

300
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,785
in the office.

301
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,301
It's stopped raining.

302
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:53,367
Eating in an office is just...
too officious.

303
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,777
I have the parlor back here.

304
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,433
Sit down.

305
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,644
Thank you.

306
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,805
You're very kind.

307
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,610
Oh, it's all for you.

308
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,619
Go ahead.
I'm not hungry.

309
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,558
You eat like a bird.

310
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,564
You would know, of course.

311
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,566
Not really.

312
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,570
I hear that the expression
"eats like a bird" is really a falsity,

313
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,664
because birds really eat
a tremendous lot.

314
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,835
I don't really know
anything about birds.

315
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,538
My hobby is stuffing things.

316
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,673
You know-- taxidermy.

317
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,186
Yeah. Yeah, l-l-I guess
I'd rather stuff birds,

318
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:16,160
well, because I hate the look
of beasts when they're stuffed.

319
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,162
You know?

320
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,756
Foxes and chimps?

321
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,699
Some people even stuff dogs and cats.
I couldn't do that.

322
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:28,606
No, l-l-I think only birds
look well stuffed...

323
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,700
because, um, they're kind of passive
to begin with.

324
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,244
That's a strange hobby.
Curious.

325
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,940
It's uncommon too.

326
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,349
I imagine so.

327
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,353
It's not as expensive as you'd think.
Cheap, really.

328
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,447
Uh, needles, thread, sawdust.

329
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:51,085
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

330
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,096
A man should have a hobby.

331
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,462
Oh, it's more than a hobby.

332
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,467
A hobby's supposed to pass your time,
not fill it.

333
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,400
Is your time so empty?

334
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,962
No. I run the office.

335
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,975
Tend the cabins, grounds.

336
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,477
Do little errands
for my mother,

337
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,208
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

338
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,114
Don't you go out
w-with friends?

339
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,085
Uh, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

340
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,894
You haven't had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

341
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,895
Only my share.

342
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,931
Where are you goin'?

343
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,327
I didn't mean to pry.

344
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,599
I'm looking for
a private island.

345
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,301
What are you running away from?

346
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,503
Why--
Why do you ask that?

347
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,006
No.

348
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,209
People never run away
from anything.

349
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,322
Rain didn't last long, did it?

350
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,120
You know what I think?

351
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,127
I think we're all in our private traps,
clamped in 'em.

352
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,528
We can never get out.

353
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:05,229
Oh, we scratch and claw,
but only at the air,

354
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,566
only at each other.

355
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:12,234
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

356
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,336
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

357
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,748
I was born into mine.

358
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,985
But I don't mind it anymore.

359
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,284
Well, you should.
You should mind.

360
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,759
I do.

361
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,387
I just--
I say that I don't.

362
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,401
Y-You know, if anyone
ever spoke to me...

363
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,869
the way I heard--
the way she talked to you, l--

364
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,168
Sometimes when she
talks to me like that,

365
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,179
I feel like I could curse her out
and leave her forever.

366
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,181
Or at least defy her.

367
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,012
Well, but I know I can't.

368
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,019
She's ill.

369
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,816
She sounded strong.

370
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,723
Uh, no.
I mean, ill.

371
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,359
She had to raise me all by herself
after my father died.

372
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,867
I was only five.
Must've been quite a strain for her.

373
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,429
It's not like she had to go to work
or anything like that.

374
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,439
H-He left her a little money.

375
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,668
Anyway, um,

376
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:22,338
a few years ago
Mother met this man.

377
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,381
He talked her into
building this motel.

378
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,884
He could've talked her
into anything.

379
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:34,452
And when he died too,
it was just--

380
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,160
just too great of a shock for her.

381
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,164
And the way that he died--

382
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:46,368
I-I guess it's nothing you should be
talking about when you're eating.

383
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,770
But, anyway, uh,

384
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,775
it was just too great
of a loss for her...

385
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,472
and, you know,
she had nothin' left.

386
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,882
Except you.

387
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,873
Yeah.

388
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,077
A son's a poor substitute
for a lover.

389
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,748
Why don't you go away?

390
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,951
- To a private island, like you?
- No. No.

391
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,554
Not like me.
Just--

392
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,000
I couldn't do that.

393
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,867
Who'd take care of her?

394
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,499
She'd be all alone up there.

395
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,667
The fire'd go out.

396
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,770
It'd be cold and damp,

397
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,779
Iike a grave.

398
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,519
If you love someone,
you can't do that to 'em.

399
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,889
Even if you hate 'em.

400
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,326
Understand, l--

401
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,596
I don't hate her.

402
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,998
I hate what she's become.

403
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,298
I hate the illness.

404
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,198
Well, wouldn't it be better...

405
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,207
i-if y-- if you--

406
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,305
if you put her someplace or--

407
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,215
Do you mean an institution?

408
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,344
A madhouse?

409
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:16,154
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

410
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,321
Put her in... someplace.

411
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:23,231
I'm sor--
I didn't mean to sound uncaring. I--

412
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:27,226
What do you know about caring?
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

413
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,240
The laughing and the tears
and the cruel eyes studying you?

414
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,037
My mother, in there?

415
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,340
She's harmless.

416
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,346
She's as harmless as one
of these stuffed birds.

417
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,246
I am sorry, l--

418
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,217
I on-- I only felt l--

419
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,415
- You felt what?
- It seemed that she was--
she's hurting you.

420
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,823
I-- I meant well.

421
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,496
People always mean well.

422
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:58,329
They cluck their thick tongues
and they shake their heads...

423
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:02,497
and they suggest,
oh, so very delicately.

424
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,679
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

425
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,687
I hate to think about it.
She needs me.

426
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,654
It's not as if she were a maniac
or a raving thing.

427
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,752
She just...

428
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,763
goes a little mad sometimes.

429
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,664
We all go a little mad sometimes.

430
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,667
Haven't you?

431
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,272
Y es.

432
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,273
Sometimes only one time
can be enough.

433
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,278
Thank you.

434
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,405
Oh, um--
Thank you, Norman?

435
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,083
Norman.

436
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:50,087
You're not goin' back
to your room already.

437
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,089
Oh, I'm very tired,

438
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,183
and I have a very long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

439
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,694
Really.

440
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,196
I stepped into
a private trap back there,

441
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,497
and I'd like to go and try
to pull myself out of it
before it's too late for me too.

442
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,503
Well, you sure you don't wanna stay
just a little while longer,

443
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,505
just for talk?

444
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,909
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

445
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,504
I'll bring you some breakfast.
What time?

446
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,550
Very early.
Dawn.

447
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,055
All right,
Miss, um, uh--

448
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,317
Crane.

449
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,326
Crane.
That's it.

450
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,328
Good night.

451
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,687
Mother?

452
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:42,851
Oh, God!
Blood! Blood!

453
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,894
Blood, blood,
blood, blood,

454
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,896
blood, blood,
blood, blood.

455
00:57:50,061 --> 00:57:53,758
They tell you
what the ingredients are...

456
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:58,268
and how it's guaranteed
to exterminate any insect in the world,

457
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:02,067
but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

458
00:58:02,173 --> 00:58:06,769
I believe, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

459
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:09,176
Wow.

460
00:58:21,493 --> 00:58:26,556
- Sam.
- Sam, there's a lady here for you.

461
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:35,929
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

462
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:39,774
- Oh. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

463
00:58:39,844 --> 00:58:44,281
- Of course not. Is something wrong?
- She left home on Friday.

464
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:47,341
I was in Tucson over
the weekend, and I haven't heard
from her, not even a phone call.

465
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:50,650
Look, if you two are in this together,
I don't care. It's none of my business.

466
00:58:50,755 --> 00:58:53,349
But I wanna talk to Marion, and I want
her to tell me it's none of my business.

467
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:55,949
- And then I'll go!
- Uh, Bob!

468
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:59,360
- Run out and get yourself lunch.
- That's okay. I brought it with me.

469
00:58:59,464 --> 00:59:01,193
Run out and eat it.

470
00:59:07,372 --> 00:59:10,864
Now what-- what thing
could we be in on together?

471
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,875
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

472
00:59:12,977 --> 00:59:16,879
Is Marion in trouble?
Or, what is it?

473
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:19,711
Let's all talk
about Marion, shall we?

474
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:25,221
Who are you, friend?

475
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:30,523
My name's Arbogast, friend.
I'm a private investigator.

476
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:33,223
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

477
00:59:33,331 --> 00:59:36,300
I know you don't. If you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

478
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:38,802
W-What's your interest in this?

479
00:59:38,837 --> 00:59:41,305
Four hundred thousand dollars.

480
00:59:42,607 --> 00:59:45,599
- Four hundred thousand dollars?
- That's right.

481
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,611
One of you better tell me
what's going on here and tell me fast.

482
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:51,614
- I can--
I can take just so much of this.
- Just take it easy, friend.

483
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:53,707
Your girlfriend stole $400,000.

484
00:59:53,818 --> 00:59:56,912
What are you talking about?
What is this?

485
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:59,922
She was supposed to bank it
on Friday for her boss.

486
01:00:00,024 --> 01:00:02,515
She didn't.
No one has seen her since.

487
01:00:02,627 --> 01:00:04,561
Oh, someone's seen her.

488
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:07,825
Someone always sees a girl
with $400,000.

489
01:00:07,932 --> 01:00:11,732
Sam, they don't wanna prosecute.
They just want the money back.
So if she's here, tell us.

490
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,739
She's not. She isn't.
She ain't here.

491
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:17,137
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

492
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:19,735
Did you come all the way up here
on a hunch and nothing more?

493
01:00:19,844 --> 01:00:21,744
Not even a hunch.
Just hope.

494
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,647
You know, with a little checking,
I could get to believe you.

495
01:00:24,749 --> 01:00:27,183
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

496
01:00:27,252 --> 01:00:31,154
All I wanna do is find Marion
before she gets into this too deeply.

497
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:33,850
Yeah. Did you check in Phoenix?
In the hospitals?

498
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,894
- Maybe she had an accident or a holdup.
- No.

499
01:00:37,962 --> 01:00:41,159
She was seen leaving town in her car,
by her employer, I might add.

500
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:44,667
Well, I can't believe it.
Can you?

501
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:47,169
Well, you know,

502
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:51,505
we're always quickest to doubt people
who have a record for being honest.

503
01:00:51,576 --> 01:00:53,510
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

504
01:00:53,578 --> 01:00:56,376
Where there's a boyfriend--

505
01:00:56,414 --> 01:01:01,113
Well, she's not back there with the nuts
and bolts, but she's here in this town.

506
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:04,678
Somewhere.
I'll find her.

507
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:15,025
- You haven't seen her?
- No.

508
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:34,485
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

509
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:38,387
- I almost drove right past.
- Yeah, I'm always forgetting
to turn the sign on.

510
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,685
But we do have a vacancy.
Twelve, in fact.

511
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:44,091
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
Some candy?

512
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:46,062
No, thanks.

513
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:49,555
Last two days, I've been
to so many motels, my eyes
are bleary with the neon.

514
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:51,569
But you know,
this is the first one...

515
01:01:51,603 --> 01:01:54,071
that looks like
it's hiding from the world.

516
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:56,164
I didn't really forget
to turn the sign on.

517
01:01:56,274 --> 01:01:58,572
It just doesn't seem
like much use anymore.

518
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:03,775
You know, that used to be
the main highway right over there.

519
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:06,282
- Wanna come in and register?
- No. No, no, no. Sit down.

520
01:02:06,384 --> 01:02:08,909
Don't wanna trouble you.
Just wanna ask you some questions.

521
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,988
No trouble at all.
Today's linen day.

522
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:14,616
I change the beds here once a week,
whether they've been used or not.

523
01:02:14,726 --> 01:02:16,785
I just hate the smell
of dampness, you know?

524
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:20,387
Such a-- I don't know--
kind of a creepy smell.

525
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:23,399
Come on.

526
01:02:23,434 --> 01:02:27,700
- You out to buy a motel?
- Uh, no.

527
01:02:27,805 --> 01:02:30,706
The reason I ask is because
you said you'd seen so many
in the past couple days.

528
01:02:30,808 --> 01:02:32,901
I thought maybe you--
What was it you wanted to ask me?

529
01:02:33,011 --> 01:02:34,911
Looking for a missing person.

530
01:02:35,013 --> 01:02:38,915
- My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.
- Mm-hmm.

531
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,011
I'm trying to trace a girl that's been
missing for, oh, about a week now.

532
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:47,615
- Mm-hmm.
- From Phoenix. It's a private matter.

533
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:50,717
Family wants to forgive her.
She's not in any trouble.

534
01:02:50,762 --> 01:02:53,731
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in any trouble.

535
01:02:53,765 --> 01:02:56,325
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah. Private investigator.

536
01:02:58,436 --> 01:03:01,132
Uh, we have reason to believe
she came along this way.

537
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:05,437
Might've stopped in the area.
Did, uh, she stop here?

538
01:03:05,476 --> 01:03:08,138
No one's stopped here
for a couple weeks.

539
01:03:08,246 --> 01:03:11,181
- Mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?
- Commit myself?

540
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:14,980
- You sure sound like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

541
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:17,283
- Mm-mm.
- You're sure.

542
01:03:17,355 --> 01:03:19,346
Yeah.

543
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,950
Well, it's possible
she used an alias.

544
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:25,996
Marion Crane is her real name,
but she could've registered
under a different one.

545
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:29,589
I don't even bother registering
people anymore. One by one,
you sort of drop formalities.

546
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:33,660
I shouldn't even be changing the sheets,
but old habits die hard.

547
01:03:33,705 --> 01:03:35,673
Oh, which reminds me.

548
01:03:36,774 --> 01:03:39,368
- What's that?
- The lights. The sign.

549
01:03:39,477 --> 01:03:42,105
We had a couple last week,
said if it hadn't been on,
they would've driven right past.

550
01:03:42,213 --> 01:03:45,876
- It looked like a deserted--
- Now, you see, that's my point.

551
01:03:45,984 --> 01:03:47,884
You said, nobody had been here
for a couple of weeks.

552
01:03:47,986 --> 01:03:49,886
Now there's this couple
came by, and...

553
01:03:49,988 --> 01:03:52,422
- Y eah. Y eah.
- they didn't know you were open.

554
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:55,459
Well, as you say,
old habits die hard.

555
01:03:55,493 --> 01:03:57,859
It's possible this girl registered
under a different name.

556
01:03:57,895 --> 01:04:01,023
- Could I look at your book?
- Mm-hmm.

557
01:04:01,132 --> 01:04:03,032
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

558
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:07,070
I got the, uh--
got the date here somewhere.

559
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:09,366
See? There's no one there.

560
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:11,772
I got a sample
of her handwriting.

561
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:22,651
Oh, yeah, here we are. ""Marie Samuels.""
That's an interesting alias.

562
01:04:22,754 --> 01:04:25,382
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

563
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:30,951
Marie-- Marion. Samuels.
Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

564
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:34,055
Was she in disguise, by any chance?
You wanna look at the picture again?

565
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:37,066
Look, Mr. Arbogast,
I'm not lying to you. It's just that--

566
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:38,965
No, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

567
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:42,598
It's just i-i-it's hard
to keep track of time around here.

568
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:45,198
Oh, I know, I know.

569
01:04:48,713 --> 01:04:50,681
Oh, yeah.

570
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:55,879
Yeah, it was raining that night,
and her hair was all wet.

571
01:04:55,987 --> 01:04:58,512
And I'll tell ya, that's not
a very good picture of her either.

572
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,391
No, I guess not.

573
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:03,690
- At all.
- I guess not. Tell me all about her.

574
01:05:03,795 --> 01:05:07,788
Well, she arrived rather late
one night and went to sleep...

575
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,730
and left early in the morning.

576
01:05:09,801 --> 01:05:11,735
- How early?
- Very early.

577
01:05:11,803 --> 01:05:14,795
- Which morning was this?
- The next day, so, Sunday.

578
01:05:14,906 --> 01:05:19,605
- Mm-hmm. Did, uh, anyone meet her here?
- Uh-uh.

579
01:05:19,644 --> 01:05:22,306
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- Nope.

580
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:26,247
- Did she make any phone calls or, uh--
- Mm-mm.

581
01:05:26,317 --> 01:05:28,444
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

582
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:31,420
- You spend the night with her?
- No.

583
01:05:31,522 --> 01:05:35,458
Well, then, how do you know she didn't
make any phone calls?

584
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,755
Well, we, um--

585
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:42,323
Well, she-she was
very tired, and--

586
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:44,765
I-l-- I'm starting
to remember it now.

587
01:05:44,836 --> 01:05:49,671
I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

588
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:53,541
Do you know how you do that?
How you make a mental
picturization of something?

589
01:05:53,644 --> 01:05:55,544
That's right.
Take your time.

590
01:05:55,646 --> 01:06:00,276
She was, uh--
Y eah, she was sitting back there.

591
01:06:00,351 --> 01:06:04,481
Mm-mm. She was standing back there,
and she had a sandwich in her hand,

592
01:06:04,555 --> 01:06:08,457
and she said that she had
a long drive ahead of her,

593
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,960
so she went to bed,
uh, straight to bed.

594
01:06:12,063 --> 01:06:14,054
- Back where?
- Back from where she came from.

595
01:06:14,165 --> 01:06:17,396
You said before, she was sitting
or standing ""back there""?

596
01:06:17,468 --> 01:06:19,663
Yes. In my parlor back there.

597
01:06:19,704 --> 01:06:22,400
She said she was very hungry,
so I made her a sandwich,

598
01:06:22,473 --> 01:06:27,308
and, uh, she, uh, said she was tired
and went straight to sleep.

599
01:06:27,378 --> 01:06:29,312
Oh, I see.

600
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,371
How'd she pay you?
A check, cash?

601
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:35,179
- Cash.
- Oh, cash, huh? Hmm.

602
01:06:35,253 --> 01:06:38,450
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Why would she?

603
01:06:38,556 --> 01:06:41,457
Y eah.

604
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:43,550
Well, I guess that's about it,
Mr. Arbogast.

605
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:46,397
So, uh, I got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

606
01:06:46,397 --> 01:06:48,399
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

607
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:52,392
If it don't jell, it ain't Jell-O,
and this just ain't jelling.

608
01:06:52,503 --> 01:06:55,904
It's not coming together somehow.
Something's missing.

609
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:58,965
I don't know what else you could expect
me to know. People just come and go.

610
01:06:59,076 --> 01:07:03,069
That's right.
She's not still here, is she?

611
01:07:03,181 --> 01:07:05,877
- No.
- Mm.

612
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:10,183
If I wanted to check the cabins, all 12
of 'em, would I need a warrant for that?

613
01:07:10,288 --> 01:07:14,987
If you don't believe me, you can help me
change the beds, if you like.

614
01:07:15,026 --> 01:07:18,587
Uh, no.
No, thanks.

615
01:07:40,218 --> 01:07:42,652
Change your mind?

616
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,816
You know, I must have one of those faces
you just can't help believing.

617
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:48,824
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

618
01:07:48,926 --> 01:07:51,588
Oh, there's someone
sitting up in the window.

619
01:07:51,629 --> 01:07:54,097
- No, there isn't.
- Oh, sure, go ahead, take a look.

620
01:07:54,198 --> 01:07:58,635
Oh, that-that's my mother.
She's an in-- invalid.

621
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:02,400
An inval-- An invalid.
It's practically like living alone.

622
01:08:02,506 --> 01:08:04,997
Oh, I see.

623
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:08,510
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would ya?

624
01:08:10,414 --> 01:08:14,407
- No.
- Not even if she paid you
a lot of money?

625
01:08:14,518 --> 01:08:16,452
- No.
- Well, let's just say,

626
01:08:16,554 --> 01:08:19,819
for the sake of argument, that she
wanted you to gallantly protect her.

627
01:08:19,924 --> 01:08:22,825
You'd know you were being used. You
wouldn't be made a fool of, would ya?

628
01:08:22,927 --> 01:08:27,159
I'm not a fool. I'm not capable of
being made a fool, not even by a woman.

629
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:29,165
It's not a slur on your manhood.
I'm sorry.

630
01:08:29,233 --> 01:08:33,727
Let's put it this way.
She might've made a fool of me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

631
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:35,738
Well, then, your mother met her?
Could I talk to your mother?

632
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,774
-As I just told you, she-she's confined.
-Yeah.

633
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:40,366
But just for a few minutes.
I-- That's all.

634
01:08:40,478 --> 01:08:43,242
There might be some hint
that you overlooked.

635
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:45,249
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

636
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:47,749
Mr. Arbogast,
l-I explained to you now--

637
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:50,047
Just for a moment.
I wouldn't disturb her.

638
01:08:50,087 --> 01:08:52,555
I've talked to you
all I want to.

639
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:57,687
- Yes, but just for one moment.
- I think it'd be much better
if you left now.

640
01:08:57,762 --> 01:09:02,961
Okay. You know, you'd save me
a lot of legwork if you'd just
let me talk to her about--

641
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,093
- Do I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

642
01:09:05,202 --> 01:09:08,171
All right.
Thanks anyway.

643
01:09:45,776 --> 01:09:49,837
Oh! Hello, Loomis?
It's Arbogast. Is Lila there?

644
01:09:49,947 --> 01:09:52,347
Can I talk to her, please?

645
01:09:54,085 --> 01:09:58,044
Hello, Lila. Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

646
01:09:58,155 --> 01:10:01,056
Y ep. She spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

647
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:03,058
It's out here
on the old highway.

648
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,561
I even know what cabin she was in.
Cabin number one.

649
01:10:06,664 --> 01:10:09,497
Well, the young fella
that runs the place said...

650
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:12,502
she just spent the night,
left the next day, and that was it.

651
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:15,164
No. No, not exactly.

652
01:10:15,272 --> 01:10:17,365
Well, I did question him.
Believe me.

653
01:10:19,477 --> 01:10:22,105
I'll have to pick up
the pieces from here.

654
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:27,473
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied.

655
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:29,918
See, this boy has
a sick old mother.

656
01:10:29,987 --> 01:10:32,922
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

657
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:37,927
No. No. Unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

658
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:42,432
Well, I was. I think
I'll go back to the motel first.

659
01:10:42,533 --> 01:10:45,900
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in an hour.

660
01:10:45,936 --> 01:10:47,904
All right.

661
01:11:35,586 --> 01:11:37,554
Bates?

662
01:14:07,371 --> 01:14:10,829
Sometimes, Saturday night has
a lonely sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

663
01:14:10,941 --> 01:14:14,843
Sam, please.
He said an hour or less.

664
01:14:17,548 --> 01:14:19,482
Y ep.
Been three.

665
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:22,485
Are we just gonna sit here
and wait?

666
01:14:24,355 --> 01:14:27,449
He'll be back.
Sit still.

667
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:29,459
Hang on.

668
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:34,488
How far is it to the old highway?

669
01:14:34,565 --> 01:14:38,262
You wanna go out there, don't ya?
Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.

670
01:14:38,302 --> 01:14:40,361
- Maybe scare her a little bit.
- Yeah.

671
01:14:40,404 --> 01:14:44,773
- Wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.
I'm going out there.

672
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:47,971
- Arbogast said--
- An hour or less.

673
01:14:48,012 --> 01:14:50,480
All right.
I'll call out there.

674
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,819
Well, I'm goin'.

675
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:03,283
You'll never find it.

676
01:15:03,394 --> 01:15:04,793
- Lila.
- What?

677
01:15:04,895 --> 01:15:08,456
- I'll go. You stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?

678
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:10,965
I don't know. One of us has to be here
in case he's on the way.

679
01:15:11,101 --> 01:15:13,626
What am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and wait?

680
01:15:13,671 --> 01:15:16,936
Yeah.

681
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,941
Have another beer.

682
01:15:36,794 --> 01:15:38,762
Mr. Arbogast?

683
01:15:41,065 --> 01:15:42,965
Mr. Arbogast?

684
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,204
Arbogast!

685
01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:07,787
- Did he come back here?
- Sam.

686
01:16:07,825 --> 01:16:11,386
No Arbogast. No Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

687
01:16:11,428 --> 01:16:15,421
Sick old lady unable to answer the door,
or unwilling.

688
01:16:15,499 --> 01:16:17,592
Where could he have gone?

689
01:16:17,701 --> 01:16:20,602
Maybe he had a lead.
Maybe he went right on ahead and--

690
01:16:20,704 --> 01:16:23,002
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.

691
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,100
Sam, he called when he had nothing,
nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

692
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:30,112
Don't you think he would've called
if he had anything at all?

693
01:16:32,116 --> 01:16:34,607
Y eah, I think
he would have.

694
01:16:34,718 --> 01:16:36,845
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

695
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,115
He's our deputy sheriff
around here.

696
01:16:39,223 --> 01:16:41,123
Let me get my Walkman.

697
01:16:45,129 --> 01:16:47,962
Now, your sister's
been missing how long?

698
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:50,727
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

699
01:16:50,834 --> 01:16:55,066
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

700
01:16:55,139 --> 01:16:58,836
Uh, they thought
that she'd be coming to me.

701
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:01,640
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Y eah.

702
01:17:01,678 --> 01:17:05,580
Then she's not missing
so much as she's run away.

703
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:08,584
- Y eah, that's right.
- From what?

704
01:17:10,354 --> 01:17:12,345
She stole some money.

705
01:17:12,389 --> 01:17:15,358
- A lot?
- Four hundred thousand dollars.

706
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,953
And the police haven't
been able to--

707
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:21,462
Everyone concerned thought that if they
could get her to give the money back,

708
01:17:21,498 --> 01:17:24,592
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

709
01:17:24,668 --> 01:17:27,967
Explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

710
01:17:28,005 --> 01:17:29,973
What exactly did he say
when he called?

711
01:17:30,073 --> 01:17:32,974
He said that Marion stayed there
for one night, and then she left.

712
01:17:33,076 --> 01:17:34,976
With the $400,000?

713
01:17:35,078 --> 01:17:37,672
He didn't say anything about
the money. It's not important
what he said on the phone.

714
01:17:37,714 --> 01:17:40,683
He was supposed to come back after he
talked to the mother, and he didn't.

715
01:17:40,717 --> 01:17:44,517
- That's what I want you
to do something about.
- Like what?

716
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:46,488
I-I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

717
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:49,822
It's just that something is wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

718
01:17:49,893 --> 01:17:53,226
Well, I think there's something
wrong too, but not the same thing.

719
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:55,457
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

720
01:17:55,532 --> 01:17:58,365
I think he got a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

721
01:17:58,435 --> 01:18:00,369
probably from Norman Bates,

722
01:18:00,437 --> 01:18:04,032
and called to keep you still
while he took off after
your sister and the money.

723
01:18:04,141 --> 01:18:07,269
No, he said he was dissatisfied
and was going back there.

724
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:10,712
Why don't you call Norman
and just let him say what happened?

725
01:18:15,219 --> 01:18:19,986
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

726
01:18:23,193 --> 01:18:25,923
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

727
01:18:25,996 --> 01:18:29,329
I've been just fine, thanks.
Listen, we got worries here.

728
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:32,391
Did you have a fellow
stop out there tonight?

729
01:18:32,436 --> 01:18:34,836
No, this one wouldn't be
a customer anyway.

730
01:18:34,905 --> 01:18:37,305
- It's a private detective, name of--
- Arbogast.

731
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:39,307
Arbogast.

732
01:18:42,513 --> 01:18:45,346
And after he left?

733
01:18:45,415 --> 01:18:47,440
No, that's okay, Norman.

734
01:18:47,518 --> 01:18:49,452
Well, this detective was there.

735
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,149
Norman told him about the girl,
the detective thanked him, went away.

736
01:18:53,223 --> 01:18:56,818
He didn't come back?
Didn't see the mother?

737
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:00,159
Your detective told you that
he couldn't come back right away...

738
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,630
because he wanted to question
Norman Bates' mother?

739
01:19:02,733 --> 01:19:04,530
- Is that right?
- Y eah.

740
01:19:04,635 --> 01:19:06,626
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

741
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:09,264
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

742
01:19:09,339 --> 01:19:14,174
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

743
01:19:14,244 --> 01:19:17,236
It ain't only local history, Sam.

744
01:19:17,281 --> 01:19:22,241
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on the Fairvale ledgers.

745
01:19:22,286 --> 01:19:25,346
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with...

746
01:19:25,455 --> 01:19:28,049
- when she found out he was married.
- Oh.

747
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:31,356
Then she took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

748
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:35,295
Strychnine.
An ugly way to die.

749
01:19:35,365 --> 01:19:38,266
Norman found them dead together.
In bed.

750
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:45,574
You mean, that old woman
I saw sittin' in the window
is not Norman Bates' mother?

751
01:19:45,676 --> 01:19:49,168
Now just a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

752
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:52,180
Y eah. In the house
behind the motel.

753
01:19:52,282 --> 01:19:56,184
I called and pounded,
but she just ignored me.

754
01:19:56,286 --> 01:20:00,780
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates,

755
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:04,088
who's that woman buried
out in Green Lawn Cemetery?

756
01:20:43,133 --> 01:20:47,237
Mother, l, uh,
have to take you downstairs.

757
01:20:47,237 --> 01:20:50,331
I am sorry, boy,

758
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:54,035
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

759
01:20:54,144 --> 01:21:00,049
- Please, Mother.
- No, I will not hide
in the fruit cellar.

760
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:03,951
Think I'm fruity, huh?
I'm staying right here.

761
01:21:03,987 --> 01:21:07,252
This is my room,
and no one will drag me out of it,

762
01:21:07,357 --> 01:21:10,087
Ieast of all my big, bold son.

763
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,094
They'll come now, Mother.

764
01:21:12,162 --> 01:21:15,393
He came after the girl.
Now someone will come after him.

765
01:21:15,465 --> 01:21:19,299
Mother, please,
it's just for a few days.

766
01:21:19,369 --> 01:21:21,803
Just for a few days
so they don't find you.

767
01:21:21,872 --> 01:21:24,466
""Just for a few days.""

768
01:21:24,574 --> 01:21:26,474
In that dank fruit cellar?

769
01:21:26,576 --> 01:21:30,478
No! You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again.

770
01:21:30,514 --> 01:21:36,077
Get out! Norman, what do you think
you're going to do?

771
01:21:36,186 --> 01:21:39,087
Don't you touch me.
Don't!

772
01:21:39,122 --> 01:21:42,785
Put me down,
and I'll walk on my own.

773
01:21:52,302 --> 01:21:55,738
Guess we better decide what we're gonna
say and do when we walk in there.

774
01:21:55,806 --> 01:21:59,298
We're gonna register
as man and wife,

775
01:21:59,342 --> 01:22:01,537
and then we're gonna
get shown to a cabin,

776
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:06,344
and we're gonna search every inch
of that place inside and out.

777
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,364
Nope. I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting?

778
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,375
Someone's in the window.
I just saw something move.

779
01:22:35,378 --> 01:22:38,142
-Well.
-We were just coming up to ring for you.

780
01:22:38,248 --> 01:22:40,148
Suppose you want a room.

781
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:43,151
Yeah, we were gonna try to make it
all the way to San Francisco,

782
01:22:43,186 --> 01:22:45,654
but we don't like
the look of that sky.

783
01:22:45,689 --> 01:22:48,783
Looks like a bad day coming up.

784
01:22:48,859 --> 01:22:50,793
Okay.

785
01:22:55,966 --> 01:22:58,264
Take you to cabin ten.

786
01:22:58,301 --> 01:23:01,566
- Uh, better sign in first.
- No, it isn't necessary.

787
01:23:01,605 --> 01:23:05,666
No, my boss paid
for this trip,

788
01:23:05,709 --> 01:23:09,076
and it's 90% business,

789
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:11,272
so he wants practically
notarized receipts.

790
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:14,282
I think we better sign in
and get a receipt.

791
01:23:14,384 --> 01:23:15,976
Mm-hmm.

792
01:23:19,756 --> 01:23:21,849
Thank you.

793
01:23:26,797 --> 01:23:28,788
- All right.
- All right.

794
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:30,890
I'll get your bags.

795
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:33,094
Uh, haven't any.

796
01:23:33,203 --> 01:23:35,501
I'll show you
to your room then.

797
01:23:35,539 --> 01:23:37,507
First time I ever seen
that happen.

798
01:23:37,574 --> 01:23:43,103
You check into any place
in this country without a bag,
you got to pay in advance.

799
01:23:44,514 --> 01:23:48,109
- Thirty-six dollars and fifty cents.
- All righty.

800
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,484
All righty.

801
01:23:56,526 --> 01:23:59,290
That receipt?

802
01:24:01,097 --> 01:24:03,429
I'll go on ahead.

803
01:24:06,703 --> 01:24:09,297
There's your receipt.
I'll show you the cabin.

804
01:24:09,406 --> 01:24:12,637
Nah, that's okay.
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

805
01:24:38,235 --> 01:24:41,136
We gotta go in there
and search that cabin, Sam,

806
01:24:41,238 --> 01:24:44,435
no matter what we're afraid of finding,
or how much it may hurt.

807
01:24:44,474 --> 01:24:46,442
I know.

808
01:24:46,476 --> 01:24:49,036
You think if something happened,
it happened here?

809
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:52,446
I don't know. If you had
a useless business like this motel,

810
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:56,986
what would it take to get out,
get a new business someplace else?

811
01:24:57,053 --> 01:24:59,749
Four hundred thousand dollars?

812
01:25:01,057 --> 01:25:03,685
Well, how can we prove that?

813
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,887
There's got to be some proof
that exists right now,

814
01:25:05,962 --> 01:25:08,556
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

815
01:25:08,598 --> 01:25:13,092
What makes
you sound so certain?

816
01:25:13,169 --> 01:25:16,263
Arbogast.
He liked me, Sam.

817
01:25:16,373 --> 01:25:18,273
Felt sorry for me. He was starting
to feel the same way about you.

818
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:20,775
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

819
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:23,370
He wouldn't have gone anywhere without
telling us unless he was stopped.

820
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:26,210
And he was stopped,
so he must've found out something.

821
01:25:26,283 --> 01:25:29,719
All right.
We'll start with cabin one.

822
01:26:05,221 --> 01:26:07,121
Bates?

823
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,964
No shower curtain.

824
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:51,966
Sam, look.

825
01:26:52,068 --> 01:26:54,866
- What is it?
- Figuring that didn't get washed down.

826
01:26:54,904 --> 01:26:58,271
Look, some figure's been added to
or subtracted from 400,000.

827
01:26:58,308 --> 01:27:00,367
Proves Marion was here.
It's too wild a coincidence.

828
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:04,176
Wait a minute.
Bates never denied she was here.

829
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,680
Uh--

830
01:27:06,783 --> 01:27:10,981
Doesn't it prove he found out
about the money?

831
01:27:11,021 --> 01:27:13,581
-Should we ask him where he's hidden it?
-No.

832
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:16,784
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

833
01:27:16,893 --> 01:27:18,793
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

834
01:27:18,895 --> 01:27:21,523
- Hey, you can't go up there.
- Why not?

835
01:27:21,598 --> 01:27:23,691
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

836
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:26,293
One of us can keep him occupied, and
the other one can get to the old woman.

837
01:27:26,403 --> 01:27:29,304
You won't be able to hold him still,
if he doesn't wanna be held.

838
01:27:29,406 --> 01:27:31,499
I don't like you going
up in that house alone.

839
01:27:31,541 --> 01:27:34,999
I can handle a sick old woman.

840
01:27:35,045 --> 01:27:38,708
All right. I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

841
01:27:54,464 --> 01:27:56,659
- Looking for me?
- Uh, yeah, matter of fact.

842
01:27:56,733 --> 01:28:00,169
Uh, wife's taking a nap,
and, uh,

843
01:28:00,236 --> 01:28:02,727
I can never keep
quiet enough for her...

844
01:28:02,839 --> 01:28:06,240
so I thought maybe
I'd look you up and talk.

845
01:28:06,342 --> 01:28:09,778
Good.
Satisfied with your cabin?

846
01:28:09,846 --> 01:28:12,440
Oh, it's fine.

847
01:29:06,136 --> 01:29:08,070
Mrs. Bates?

848
01:29:08,171 --> 01:29:10,901
You're alone here,
aren't you?

849
01:29:10,974 --> 01:29:13,067
It would drive me crazy.

850
01:29:13,176 --> 01:29:16,009
That'd be a rather extreme reaction,
don't you think?

851
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:20,015
That's just an expression.
What I meant was, uh, I'd do
just about anything to get away.

852
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:22,381
Wouldn't you?

853
01:29:22,485 --> 01:29:24,385
No.

854
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:27,285
Mrs. Bates?

855
01:29:30,193 --> 01:29:32,923
Mrs. Bates?

856
01:30:31,254 --> 01:30:34,655
I'm not saying
you shouldn't be contented here.
I'm just doubtin' that you are.

857
01:30:34,757 --> 01:30:39,592
I think if you saw a chance
to get out from under here,
you'd unload this place.

858
01:30:39,662 --> 01:30:41,857
""This place""?

859
01:30:41,965 --> 01:30:44,593
This place happens to be
my only world.

860
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:47,864
See, I grew up in that house up there
and had a very happy childhood.

861
01:30:47,971 --> 01:30:51,372
My mother and me...
were more than happy.

862
01:31:32,749 --> 01:31:36,116
You seem frightened.
Am I saying something frightening?

863
01:31:36,152 --> 01:31:38,120
I don't know
what you're saying.

864
01:31:38,154 --> 01:31:41,612
I'm talkin' about your mother,
about your motel.

865
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:45,719
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

866
01:31:45,795 --> 01:31:49,060
Buy a new one, in a new town...

867
01:31:49,165 --> 01:31:52,066
where you won't
have to hide your mother.

868
01:31:52,168 --> 01:31:56,002
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here.

869
01:31:56,072 --> 01:31:59,064
Where you gonna get that kind of money?
Or, do you already have it somewhere?

870
01:31:59,175 --> 01:32:02,167
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Huh?

871
01:32:02,278 --> 01:32:05,179
A lot of it.
Four hundred thousand dollars.

872
01:32:05,281 --> 01:32:08,614
I bet your mother knows where it is
and what you did to get it.

873
01:32:08,685 --> 01:32:11,620
Where's that girl
that you came here with?

874
01:32:13,489 --> 01:32:15,787
I'll bet she'll tell us.

875
01:33:29,632 --> 01:33:31,532
Mrs. Bates?

876
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:42,638
So, Norman.

877
01:34:42,672 --> 01:34:46,403
If anybody can get any answers,
it'll be the psychiatrist.

878
01:34:46,442 --> 01:34:50,811
Even I couldn't get to Norman,
and he knows me.

879
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,781
You warm enough, miss?

880
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:57,284
Did he talk to you?

881
01:34:57,386 --> 01:34:59,718
No.

882
01:34:59,789 --> 01:35:03,987
I got the whole story,
but not from Norman.

883
01:35:04,026 --> 01:35:05,994
I got it from his mother.

884
01:35:06,028 --> 01:35:09,088
Norman Bates no longer exists.

885
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:12,292
He only half-existed
to begin with.

886
01:35:12,335 --> 01:35:15,304
Now, the other half
has taken over.

887
01:35:15,338 --> 01:35:17,306
Probably for all time.

888
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:20,309
- Did he kill my sister?
- Y es.

889
01:35:20,409 --> 01:35:24,004
I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

890
01:35:24,046 --> 01:35:27,504
If you drag the swamp
in the vicinity of the motel--

891
01:35:30,019 --> 01:35:34,115
To understand it as I understood it,
hearing it from the ""mother""--

892
01:35:34,223 --> 01:35:37,317
that is, the mother-half
of Norman's mind--

893
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,351
you have to go back ten years...

894
01:35:39,428 --> 01:35:43,125
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

895
01:35:44,734 --> 01:35:47,134
He was already
dangerously disturbed.

896
01:35:47,236 --> 01:35:50,034
Had been ever since his father died.

897
01:35:50,139 --> 01:35:53,870
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman,

898
01:35:53,943 --> 01:35:58,880
and for years they lived as if
there was no one else in the world.

899
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:00,149
Then she found a man,
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

900
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:03,949
Then she found a man,
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

901
01:36:04,053 --> 01:36:07,648
That pushed him over the thin line,
and he killed them both.

902
01:36:07,757 --> 01:36:12,854
So, he had to erase the crime,
at least in his mind.

903
01:36:12,895 --> 01:36:17,264
He stole her corpse,
and a weighted coffin was buried.

904
01:36:17,366 --> 01:36:20,494
He hid the body in the fruit cellar
and treated it...

905
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:25,166
to keep it
as well as it would keep.

906
01:36:25,274 --> 01:36:29,973
And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.

907
01:36:30,012 --> 01:36:33,914
So, he began to think
and speak for her.

908
01:36:33,983 --> 01:36:36,884
At times, he could be
both personalities,

909
01:36:36,919 --> 01:36:38,887
carry on conversations.

910
01:36:38,921 --> 01:36:42,516
At other times,
the mother-half took over completely.

911
01:36:42,592 --> 01:36:47,393
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only ""Mother."

912
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:49,796
When he met your sister,

913
01:36:49,899 --> 01:36:53,801
he was touched by her
and aroused by her.

914
01:36:53,903 --> 01:36:58,499
He wanted her.
This set off his jealous mother.

915
01:36:58,541 --> 01:37:01,908
And ""Mother"" killed the girl.

916
01:37:02,011 --> 01:37:05,742
Whenever reality came too close,

917
01:37:05,815 --> 01:37:10,616
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

918
01:37:10,653 --> 01:37:14,350
he'd dress up--
even to a cheap wig he'd bought--

919
01:37:14,423 --> 01:37:18,086
and he'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair,

920
01:37:18,194 --> 01:37:20,992
speak in her voice.

921
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:24,522
He tried to be his mother.

922
01:37:26,836 --> 01:37:29,464
And now he is.

923
01:37:29,572 --> 01:37:33,474
- And the $400,000? Who got that?
- The swamp.

924
01:37:33,576 --> 01:37:36,875
These were crimes of passion,
not profit.

925
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:42,512
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

926
01:37:42,585 --> 01:37:44,678
- Sure.
- All right.

927
01:38:00,202 --> 01:38:02,102
Thank you.

928
01:38:10,713 --> 01:38:16,345
It's sad when a mother has to speak
the words that condemn her own son,

929
01:38:16,419 --> 01:38:20,822
but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.

930
01:38:20,856 --> 01:38:22,824
They'll put him away now,

931
01:38:22,858 --> 01:38:25,827
as I should have years ago.

932
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:29,024
He was always bad.

933
01:38:29,131 --> 01:38:34,728
And in the end, he intended to tell them
that I killed those girls and that man.

934
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:38,331
As if I could do anything
except just sit and stare,

935
01:38:38,374 --> 01:38:40,740
Iike one of his stuffed birds.

936
01:38:40,776 --> 01:38:46,237
Well, they know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

937
01:38:46,282 --> 01:38:48,773
I'll just sit here
and be quiet,

938
01:38:48,851 --> 01:38:53,015
just in case they do suspect me.

939
01:38:53,122 --> 01:38:56,922
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

940
01:38:56,959 --> 01:38:59,621
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

941
01:38:59,729 --> 01:39:01,720
I'm not even gonna
swat that fly.

942
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:04,129
- I hope they are watching.
- They're probably watching me.

943
01:39:04,166 --> 01:39:07,135
- They'll see.
- Well, I'll let 'em.

944
01:39:07,169 --> 01:39:09,228
They'll see, and they'll know.

945
01:39:09,338 --> 01:39:14,435
And they'll say,
""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."

946
01:39:30,559 --> 01:39:33,494
Yeah, you're gonna
get stuck on somethin'.

947
01:39:33,562 --> 01:39:35,496
Keep pullin'.

948
01:40:32,888 --> 01:40:35,721
- Don't go in there.
- Guys, it's done!

949
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:38,225
It's all clear here.
Comin' through!

950
01:40:38,294 --> 01:40:40,524
All right, comin' through.
