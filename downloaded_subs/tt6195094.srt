00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:42,877
Patrick had a vague feeling,
something was about to happen.

3
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:47,074
How could he tell his parents...

4
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:48,908
that the malevolent things
were all around?

5
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,207
In the ether and in each
speck of dust.

6
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,108
Patrick had always seen these
things...

7
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,908
and always it had seemed that
he alone knew about them.

8
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,007
And so, on the evening
of the seventh day...

9
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,541
he could feel their imminent
arrival.

10
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:06,475
Something in the breeze
of twilight had whispered...

11
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:09,374
"It's going to happen tonight".

12
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:12,875
The following day when his
mother opened the door...

13
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:16,007
there was absolutely nothing
there.

14
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,108
The trail of Patrick William
Ward's urine...

15
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,910
led to an empty closet bathed in
the darkness of his last night.

16
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,308
The end.

17
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,275
Wow, gosh.

18
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:31,375
Here we go.

19
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:33,075
That's one of your best!

20
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,974
Mom, you tell her that every
single time.

21
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:37,140
Yeah, but this time I mean it.

22
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:38,275
Really?

23
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:41,307
I was fascinated, captivated,
scared.

24
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:42,474
It was like...

25
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,640
- Lovecraft.
- Lovecraft.

26
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:46,040
- I know, too much like him, huh?
- No.

27
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,508
I haven't completely found
my voice yet.

28
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,208
Hm, yeah, that's what it is.

29
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,308
Vera!

30
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,408
Mom, my sister's a freak.

31
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,941
Something new, please.

32
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:55,407
No, Beth, honestly,

33
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,008
I can't wrap my mind around how
you spent days writing this...

34
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,140
piece of crap that ends
with piss on the carpet.

35
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:02,875
You wouldn't understand.

36
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:04,441
What the hell are your stories
supposed to mean?

37
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:06,008
They're supposed to be scary.

38
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,007
Oh, scary, what's scary
is having you as a sister...

39
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,277
but, good luck finding
a boyfriend.

40
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,576
I don't speak French!

41
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,308
Keep writing, Beth.

42
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,974
What if I'm not good enough?

43
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:20,174
You are good enough, Beth.

44
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:23,242
You're only saying that cause
you're my mom.

45
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:27,178
What's that?

46
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:37,977
What the fuck?

47
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,111
Okay, buddy.

48
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:08,441
No French, Mom.

49
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,141
It's green, everyone likes it.

50
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:32,574
No, no.

51
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:36,241
Yeah, it's no problem, yeah.

52
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,810
That's quite the vintage
car you got there.

53
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,041
Mom and I love old things.

54
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:43,241
You just passing though?

55
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,874
No.

56
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:46,908
I mean, we're moving here,
into Aunt Clarisse's house.

57
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,875
Aunt Clarisse? She live around
here?

58
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:50,307
Um, I'm not sure exactly.

59
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:51,975
I mean, she's dead.

60
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:54,474
She was my mother's cousin's
sister-in-law, or something.

61
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:57,275
Ah, Clarisse Jourdan, that
kooky, old French lady...

62
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,573
who had that place way up
in the prair... oh, damn it!

63
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,540
For Christ's sake! It's gonna
smell like nail polish...

64
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,941
in here for at least a week.

65
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:06,378
Watch the store for a minute,
will ya, Miss... Jourdan.

66
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,911
My name's Keller.

67
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,076
What you doing?

68
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,307
What is that?

69
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:58,875
A story you wouldn't like.

70
00:05:58,877 --> 00:05:59,811
How would you know?

71
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,943
Is there nobody here?

72
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,074
Oh god, it stinks.

73
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,143
She'll be right back.

74
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:13,211
My god, I look heinous.

75
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,140
Okay, what's the story about?

76
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,175
Some guy's been breaking into
homes, murdering the parents...

77
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:24,107
and sparing the daughters,
who are always about your age.

78
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,141
Uh-huh... and?

79
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:28,373
He stays in the house
with her...

80
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,407
along with the parents' dead
bodies.

81
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,640
Tss, you made that up.

82
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,342
Girls!

83
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,277
Let's go?

84
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:53,044
Jesus Christ, it's Rob Zombie's
house.

85
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,506
She's gonna like it.

86
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,406
It's not bad.

87
00:06:58,408 --> 00:07:01,874
Yeah, it's an extension
of your brain.

88
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,041
You got to be kidding me.

89
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:05,040
The bedrooms are upstairs.

90
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,340
Mom, it smells like old
ladies in here.

91
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,108
It smells like mold, Vera.

92
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,944
Yeah, that's what I said.

93
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,540
Look at all these dolls.

94
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,573
Clarissa never
let me play with them.

95
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,876
What was Aunt Clarisse's deal?

96
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:22,910
- Is it working?
- Nope!

97
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:29,507
Bingo!

98
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:34,008
When are you gonna give up this
arty writer bullshit...

99
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,941
and just use a laptop?

100
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:37,075
Never.

101
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:39,242
Oh god, it's like
a flea market in here.

102
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:42,641
Think she bought all these
for herself?

103
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:44,410
You know, old ladies love
that kind of crap.

104
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:49,075
- A Chinese puzzle box.
- What?

105
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,274
It's more than a mirror,
it's actually a box.

106
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:53,406
I've read about these.

107
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:56,010
There's gotta be a secret button
somewhere.

108
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:09,443
Jesus!

109
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,811
- So, you like it?
- No.

110
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,507
Vera, careful with that.

111
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:36,111
Who would even want to
buy something like that?

112
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,510
Honey?

113
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:45,943
Baby? Beth? Beth...

114
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:48,810
I'm okay.

115
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,943
Oh, sweetie.

116
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:57,174
Of course, you're okay.
That's why you look so pale.

117
00:08:57,176 --> 00:09:00,075
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

118
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:03,274
She's like you now.

119
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,174
Great. Well, you know you have
a great sense of timing.

120
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,877
Vera!

121
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,540
Is she alright?

122
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,307
Oh, so now you ask.

123
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,373
You could have stayed
and helped her out.

124
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,976
Why bother, you'd rush and
rescue her anyways.

125
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,908
I just, I don't get why she
would write these stories...

126
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,306
when she falls apart at the
first sight of blood.

127
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:37,541
Mom, she's afraid of flying,
she's afraid of boys...

128
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,143
she's afraid of her own
freakin' shadow.

129
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:46,107
The other day when I was
packing...

130
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,441
I found something you'll
never believe.

131
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:51,474
I'm not into games, Vera.

132
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:54,241
An interview with her, Mom.

133
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:57,173
Several pages, all typed up
like it was in a magazine.

134
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,406
She made the whole thing up.

135
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:02,273
Like, in it, she's some famous
writer and this journalist...

136
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,641
is asking her all these
questions about her books.

137
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,874
She needs a reality check, Mom!

138
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:11,106
It's nice to know you do love
your sister after all.

139
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,641
I know you're angry about
leaving...

140
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,074
your boyfriend behind, Vera,
but...

141
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:15,307
Whatever, Mom.

142
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,910
And quit wearing make-up.

143
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:30,474
Fuck you! Piece of shit!

144
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:33,176
I know you love her more!

145
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,343
Beth, Beth... fucking Beth.

146
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,142
Shit.

147
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:56,843
Shit.

148
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,240
Mom!

149
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,474
Where does your antique lamp go?

150
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,207
I'm upstairs!

151
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,608
With you favorite writer,
I know.

152
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,140
Your antique lamp, where
does it go?

153
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,043
In your room.

154
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,975
Did you hear me?

155
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,210
Yes!

156
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,174
Hey, go easy on the door.

157
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:33,342
Enjoying my bed are you?

158
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:39,273
This is yours.
Oh, this is yours too.

159
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:42,075
Your Cthulhu shit is not
staying in my room, take it.

160
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,607
Would it kill you to be...

161
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,273
a little nicer to your sister?

162
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,074
It might.

163
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,576
You are unbearable!

164
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,207
Not mine!

165
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:02,811
It's an old house.

166
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:10,241
God, Mom, it's my room!
Go help Lovecraft Junior. Jesus!

167
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:17,242
<i>Lower!</i>

168
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,409
Shit.

169
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,941
Jane? What?

170
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:38,075
<i>I can barely hear you. Hello?</i>

171
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:46,177
Hello? Jane, I can't hear you.

172
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,276
Agh!

173
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,911
Agh!

174
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:22,377
Mom? Mom!

175
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,107
Agh!

176
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:36,174
No! No!

177
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,544
They just wanna play with dolls.

178
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:11,209
Don't look at me.

179
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,309
No!

180
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:36,939
Listen to me, Beth.

181
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:41,906
You have to go please, go run
away, baby, run away!

182
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,009
No!

183
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,174
No!

184
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:11,109
Fucker!

185
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,942
Mom!

186
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:54,842
Mom! Mom! No, no!

187
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,074
No! No!

188
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:05,241
Beth, Beth, come here, come
here, baby, baby, come here.

189
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,340
Hey, hey, it's okay, Beth,
it's okay.

190
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:13,306
You're okay. You're okay, hey.

191
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:14,509
Oh, god.

192
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:17,874
I was in the basement.

193
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,507
I know, I know.

194
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:22,974
- With Vera.
- It's over now, okay?

195
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,107
It was so real.

196
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,277
It was a long time ago, Beth.

197
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:32,209
Hey. Oh... hey.

198
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:45,040
<i>It's
a beautiful morning on CO1.</i>

199
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:49,242
<i>Sit back and enjoy Chicago's
classical music station.</i>

200
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,406
Yeah?

201
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:35,542
Uh, it's Jerry.

202
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,506
Hey, Jerry...

203
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,207
No, I'm sorry, she can't come
to the phone right now.

204
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,505
<i>I need to talk to her.</i>

205
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,107
Yeah, I'll get her to call you
back right away.

206
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,340
<i>Five times the sales.</i>

207
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:45,506
Excuse me.

208
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,007
Five times, my friend,
is she writing?

209
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,006
Uh, yeah, no, of course,
she's writing.

210
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:50,306
<i>We're all
gonna be there tonight.</i>

211
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:51,973
This is it, does she get it?

212
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:53,374
I don't know, Jerry. I'll tell
her, she's right here.

213
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,874
I'm gonna tell her right now,
okay?

214
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,207
- <i>Okay, cool.</i>
- Okay, great, thanks.

215
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,373
<i>I'm so fucking happy.</i>

216
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,006
The entire publishing staff
are gonna be at the show.

217
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:04,173
Your sales are through the roof,
they adore you!

218
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,539
They adore the sales.

219
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,274
Do you want to know?

220
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:09,639
I hate numbers.

221
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:12,342
Well, but they're huge.

222
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,040
And they love you.

223
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:22,374
Yes, hi... no, I just told her!
Okay.

224
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:25,907
Tonight's guest has been
described as a master of horror.

225
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,174
Her latest book is
"INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND".

226
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:30,874
It's only been out two weeks...

227
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:33,340
and already it's topping the
bestseller lists.

228
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,506
We're very lucky to have her...

229
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:38,907
as she very rarely makes
television appearances...

230
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:41,040
Elizabeth Keller!

231
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:43,307
Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet
you, Elizabeth.

232
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,074
It's a pleasure for me,
too, Eve.

233
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:46,974
"Incident in a Ghostland"...

234
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:49,874
is your most personal book
so far...

235
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,140
and a kind of tribute to your
family.

236
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,007
Yes, that's true.

237
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:58,174
What happened to you and your
sister when you were teenagers?

238
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:00,874
Oh, are you asking if the book
is autobiographical?

239
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:04,007
What I'm saying, Elizabeth,
is that it just seems so real.

240
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:07,406
The details are so intense that
I guess the question is...

241
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:09,040
why write this book?

242
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,506
To keep from going insane.

243
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,476
Truly?

244
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:17,540
I mean, is there a better reason
to write?

245
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,040
No.

246
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:21,173
She just wouldn't shut up
about Vera and I...

247
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:23,240
I got defensive, I'm sure
everyone noticed.

248
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,505
It's not as bad as that.

249
00:22:26,507 --> 00:22:29,906
You know, in your own mysterious
way, you call the shots.

250
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,106
You're only saying that because
you're my biggest fan.

251
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:34,575
Shit, you're right.

252
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,539
I'm gonna take Harlequin
up to bed.

253
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,340
Are you sure you wanna watch
this all over again?

254
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:47,043
Take a note from your son,
look how much he cares.

255
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:50,940
He's not gonna go to bed
in this, is he?

256
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:52,372
Why not, he loves this costume?

257
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,943
I told you, they love you!

258
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:08,042
Hello? Hello?

259
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,940
Hello?

260
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,040
<i>Beth! Please,
you have to come back.</i>

261
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,406
Vera?

262
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:16,405
<i>Come back! Please...</i>

263
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:18,339
Is Mom there with you?

264
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:19,573
<i>They're in the house!</i>

265
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,074
Vera, listen to me.

266
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:22,305
<i>You're not hearing me, Beth.</i>

267
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:23,406
I hear you!

268
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:25,607
<i>Don't leave me alone, Beth.</i>

269
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,107
Is Mom there?

270
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,176
Vera!

271
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,106
Your Mom's with her obviously,
right?

272
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:34,339
She has to be.

273
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:36,139
Pick up, Mom, pick up.

274
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,539
It's busy.

275
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,408
Okay. You can just try again.

276
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,406
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

277
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:52,572
<i>I don't know,
it could be nothing...</i>

278
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,440
<i>just one of Vera's delusions,
but...</i>

279
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,241
<i>Mom isn't answering her
phone...</i>

280
00:23:56,243 --> 00:23:58,240
<i>and I'm having those
dreams again.</i>

281
00:23:58,242 --> 00:23:59,405
<i>Something's not right.</i>

282
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:00,974
<i>I understand, but...</i>

283
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,406
<i>They never should have
stayed in that house.</i>

284
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:03,939
<i>It's not helping Vera.</i>

285
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,572
<i>She should be in a hospital.</i>

286
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>All right.
Call us when you get there.</i>

287
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:09,606
<i>I will.</i>

288
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:12,040
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

289
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,074
Here? Are you sure?

290
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,241
Yes.

291
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,542
Mom?

292
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,341
Mom!

293
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,142
Mom?

294
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,208
Beth?

295
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:18,341
Oh, baby doll! What are you
doing here?

296
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:22,040
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

297
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,472
Vera called last night.

298
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:25,472
She was screaming in the phone
and then it got disconnected.

299
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:28,006
I tried calling back, but I
couldn't get through.

300
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:29,505
And I didn't know what
was happening.

301
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:31,240
I didn't know she used
the phone.

302
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:33,876
- Everything's okay?
- Yeah, she's resting.

303
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:38,505
I've missed you so much!

304
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:40,406
You look beautiful.

305
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,205
You haven't changed at all.

306
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,010
Oh well!

307
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:14,342
House looks exactly the same,
Mom.

308
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,073
After all these years...

309
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,874
you're still living in old
Clarisse's style.

310
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:21,205
Unfair.

311
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,873
I sold most of it.

312
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,206
Yeah?

313
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,073
You'd never believe what I got
for the antique toys.

314
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:29,405
Really?

315
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:34,873
And, I'm going to be able
to redo the whole house.

316
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,639
Mom, haven't you been getting
the money I send you?

317
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:38,075
Sure I have.

318
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:44,876
Oh, Beth, I didn't mean
it like that.

319
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,272
Mom, if it's not enough,
just tell me.

320
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,940
I don't even know why
I said that.

321
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:53,340
You're already spoiling me!

322
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:56,043
I'm your daughter, I can do it,
I'm not spoiling you, I...

323
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,539
Oh, sweetie.

324
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,874
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I overreacted.

325
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:02,809
Beth...

326
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,639
You're not mad at me?

327
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,306
Why would I be mad?

328
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:10,339
Because I left you here
all alone with Vera and...

329
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:12,105
Beth, look at me.

330
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:14,040
You didn't abandon me.

331
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:16,306
You left because you had your
own life to live.

332
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:18,606
That's perfectly natural.
Understood?

333
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:21,975
Now dry those tears,
that's my girl.

334
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,010
Let's have a toast!

335
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:41,075
Since when did you start
drinking redneck beer?

336
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:55,173
Shit.

337
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,105
The key above the door.

338
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:58,273
You lock her in?

339
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:00,206
No, honey, she does.

340
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,272
She hides the key down there.

341
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:04,909
I made a copy.

342
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:13,439
Vera! Sweetie! Are you hiding?

343
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,074
Vera?

344
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:22,042
The first-aid kit, Beth, in the
wardrobe to your left.

345
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:26,242
Vera, where are you?

346
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:31,342
Honey? The first aid kit, Beth!

347
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:39,105
Help me!

348
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:41,441
Vera! Mom!

349
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:44,573
Grab her legs, hurry up!

350
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:45,972
No!

351
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,939
Beth! Move... grab her legs!

352
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,342
It's okay.

353
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,240
No!

354
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:57,441
Ssh, it's okay, it's okay,
get in the room.

355
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,138
Help me!

356
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,405
Calm down, Vera,
it's okay, calm down.

357
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,273
Help me!

358
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:10,376
Calm down. Get the key, Beth.

359
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:17,038
Look at me. It's over,
babe. It's over....

360
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,406
there you go, it's over.

361
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:23,173
Never again... hurt me.

362
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,306
No one's going to hurt you,
honey.

363
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:25,506
My sister.

364
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:27,242
Ssh...

365
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:31,906
Beth...

366
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:34,405
I'm here, Vera.

367
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:35,973
She sees you.

368
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,876
- Vera...
- She sees you.

369
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:51,173
<i>Please tell me how you got the
inspiration for this book?</i>

370
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:52,874
<i>Sure, yeah, it all started...</i>

371
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,340
<i>when I was doing my masters
degree at the Sorbone...</i>

372
00:29:55,342 --> 00:29:57,873
<i>and I went to galleries
in Paris...</i>

373
00:30:06,975 --> 00:30:08,442
Come here.

374
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,573
<i>And I went in
and saw a bunch...</i>

375
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:14,073
<i>of what seemed like outsider
art, it was bizarre...</i>

376
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:16,141
<i>it was kind of off-kilter.</i>

377
00:30:23,342 --> 00:30:25,309
It's tough, isn't it?

378
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,874
I know.

379
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,476
How do you do it, Mom?

380
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:46,305
Last week I found her
in my room...

381
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:49,472
tied to the radiator.

382
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,373
She was screaming like...

383
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:56,309
I had to turn around to make
sure no one was there.

384
00:30:58,308 --> 00:30:59,409
What can I do?

385
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:03,308
There's nothing you can do,
Beth.

386
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:09,509
She keeps reliving that night,
over and over.

387
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:13,308
Come here.

388
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,208
It's okay.

389
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,975
Help me!

390
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:30,809
Vera?

391
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,308
Are you gonna let me die alone?

392
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:01,539
No, not alone?

393
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,475
You're not going to die, Vera.

394
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:14,372
They're making me pay,
and you're not there.

395
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:18,439
I move, and they burn me.

396
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:23,842
I scream and they...
please, please!

397
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:30,039
I'm begging you, please tell
them...

398
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,038
tell them I'm not a bad girl.

399
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,272
Vera, Vera listen to me, okay?

400
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:35,973
And I'm sorry if I offended
them!

401
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:38,572
Tell them to stop punishing me.

402
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,572
You didn't do anything wrong.

403
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:42,405
- Tell them...
- It's not your fault.

404
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:45,638
It's not your fault, okay?

405
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,273
- They're here.
- Vera, it's just Mom, Vera...

406
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:53,342
Vera!

407
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:00,476
The truck! Oh god.

408
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,808
The truck.

409
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,275
Mom?

410
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,138
Get lost!

411
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,205
Up already, sweetie?

412
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:02,441
Yeah.

413
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:06,473
Did Eugene come?

414
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:10,105
So much crap in this house.

415
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:12,939
Did he leave you the bill?

416
00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:14,342
Oh, I didn't even see him.

417
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:21,176
<i>What a great day
for a picnic.</i>

418
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:50,072
Mm, you still smell like Beth.

419
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,972
That smell drove me crazy.

420
00:36:52,974 --> 00:36:54,973
What are you talking about?

421
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:58,340
I should have eaten you up,
you and Vera.

422
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,572
So you'd never leave me.

423
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:04,205
So no boys could ever come
near my girls.

424
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:06,872
Stop drinking, Mom.

425
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:09,305
The flesh of my daughters.

426
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:12,109
You're not making any sense.

427
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,873
Are you okay, Mom?

428
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,242
God, I look like shit.

429
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:27,638
I don't know where your talent
comes from, honey.

430
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,275
Your capacity to create
your own worlds.

431
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:43,571
Does it still hurt?

432
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:46,375
Nothing hurts for real anymore.

433
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:52,405
You're still pretty, Mom.

434
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:55,105
What I'm trying to say
is that...

435
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:59,908
Incident in a Ghost Land
is your best novel yet.

436
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:03,273
You read it?

437
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:05,173
Of course, I did...

438
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:10,005
and it was so good that it
completely rattled me.

439
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:13,873
I didn't send the book
because...

440
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,405
You're better
than Lovecraft!

441
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:20,008
Beth, I miss you.

442
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:25,841
Leave me... all alone.

443
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:41,308
Vera!

444
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,038
Vera, it's okay. It's okay.

445
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,039
Vera, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

446
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,273
Vera, what did you do?

447
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,972
Vera, look at me.

448
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:03,375
Vera, nobody's here.
No one is here, Vera!

449
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,440
Where's the key?

450
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,905
No!

451
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:22,909
No, no, no, no, no...

452
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:30,438
Vera, Vera, Vera!

453
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,206
Listen to me, please open
the door.

454
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:34,909
Stop it!

455
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:42,239
Vera! Open the door!

456
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:43,271
Vera, please!

457
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:54,041
Vera?

458
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:11,374
Agh!

459
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:28,173
Mom!

460
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:43,505
Mom, Mom, where's the key?
Vera's having a fit!

461
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:46,005
She's locked herself in her
room! Where's the bedroom key?

462
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,371
The bedroom key, where
is the bedroom key?

463
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,507
There's no key, honey.

464
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:54,006
Stop! I hate you!

465
00:41:54,008 --> 00:41:55,875
Vera?

466
00:41:57,341 --> 00:42:00,109
Vera?

467
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,075
Agh!

468
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:16,372
Get off me, you motherfucker!
Agh!

469
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:18,942
Fucking asshole!

470
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:34,374
Vera? Vera?

471
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,538
Mom, call an ambulance!

472
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,808
Vera!

473
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:48,909
Vera? Wait, stay! Stay okay?

474
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:00,474
Okay! It's okay, it's okay.
Here you go, here you go.

475
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:03,575
The ambulance is on its way!

476
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:09,005
I know why you did that.

477
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:12,075
I know what you want
from your sister.

478
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,271
I'll wait for them on the road.

479
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:18,072
Otherwise they'll miss
the trail.

480
00:43:18,074 --> 00:43:19,905
Mom?

481
00:43:19,907 --> 00:43:21,974
Stay with her, and wait for me.

482
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:26,605
Mom, what did you mean
back there?

483
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:29,008
Don't listen to her, Beth.

484
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:01,238
Vera? Vera?

485
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,471
Vera, stay with me!
Stay with me, Vera!

486
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:06,808
Vera! Stay with me.

487
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:13,875
Vera... Vera?

488
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:18,374
I can hear you.

489
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,239
Oh, Vera, I can hear you.
Vera, please stay with me.

490
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:28,006
Please, Vera. Vera?

491
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,874
Vera?

492
00:44:32,907 --> 00:44:39,204
We broke your sister...

493
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:41,574
and now, it's your turn.

494
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,341
Mom?

495
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:14,275
Mom! Mom?

496
00:47:16,907 --> 00:47:18,241
Mom?

497
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:25,842
Mom!

498
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,108
Vera?

499
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:57,140
What did you do to me?

500
00:48:58,873 --> 00:49:01,174
Do you understand now, Beth?

501
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,339
Vera, what'd you do to me?

502
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:09,171
They broke me and now they're
playing with you.

503
00:49:09,173 --> 00:49:10,471
Vera...

504
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:11,871
He chose you, Beth.

505
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:13,205
You psycho!

506
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:15,004
- Stop it!
- Tell me what you did!

507
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:16,505
- It's not me!
- Tell me!

508
00:49:16,507 --> 00:49:20,275
Stop it, Beth! Wake up, Beth!

509
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:25,606
For once in your life,
stop running away!

510
00:49:25,608 --> 00:49:28,575
Try to accept reality!
Come back!

511
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:35,941
Beth, you're still here.

512
00:49:43,641 --> 00:49:48,471
Beth, listen to me...
accept what happened...

513
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:51,474
you just need to face the truth.

514
00:49:53,374 --> 00:49:54,472
Mom.

515
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:56,371
There was nothing she could do.

516
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:58,440
No, no, no, no...

517
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:01,440
No!

518
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,937
Mom died, Beth.

519
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:09,940
- No.
- Yes, she did, she died.

520
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,940
They killed her, Beth.
She died.

521
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:23,507
I'm so sorry.

522
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:30,241
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy...

523
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:34,240
Ssh... she died, Beth.

524
00:50:36,973 --> 00:50:39,040
You have to let her go.

525
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,475
Ssh, Beth...

526
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,241
It's just us.

527
00:50:57,939 --> 00:51:00,274
It's just us, now.

528
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,440
Are you back?

529
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,274
Beth, are you back?

530
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,374
You were talking to them
like they were real.

531
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:59,971
And to Mom, you looked at me
like I was crazy!

532
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:05,041
You couldn't hear me.
You were gone.

533
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,375
I didn't know how to bring
you back.

534
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,274
I hate you, Vera!

535
00:53:03,207 --> 00:53:07,471
I hate you, Vera!
I hate you, Vera!

536
00:53:07,473 --> 00:53:10,305
I hate you!

537
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:08,374
Get up, get up, now, now!
We have to hide!

538
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,338
Ssh... in here!

539
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,405
It's a game, okay?
She wants us to hide!

540
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:22,172
Listen to me, if she takes
you upstairs, you don't move.

541
00:54:22,174 --> 00:54:24,104
And you don't cry, okay?

542
00:54:24,106 --> 00:54:27,071
No matter... no matter
what he does to you.

543
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:29,239
He'll go easier, okay?

544
00:54:31,306 --> 00:54:33,538
Last time I hit him in the leg,
he hurt me much worse.

545
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,440
Don't do it.

546
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:20,605
<i>Listen to me...</i>

547
00:58:20,607 --> 00:58:23,904
<i>if she takes you upstairs...</i>

548
00:58:23,906 --> 00:58:29,808
<i>no matter what he does,
you don't move, and don't cry.</i>

549
00:59:39,173 --> 00:59:41,072
<i>You're pretty.
Will you be my friend?</i>

550
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:45,136
<i>You're pretty.
Will you be my friend?</i>

551
00:59:45,138 --> 00:59:48,873
<i>Do you want to be friends?
I like you.</i>

552
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:57,339
<i>I like you. You're pretty.
Will you be my friend?</i>

553
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:55,307
No!

554
01:02:53,305 --> 01:02:55,106
Agh!

555
01:03:01,505 --> 01:03:05,070
<i>I love you. You're pretty.</i>

556
01:03:07,938 --> 01:03:10,371
<i>Nobody loves you.
You're ugly.</i>

557
01:03:10,373 --> 01:03:15,170
<i>You're a fucking pig!
You're a fucking pig!</i>

558
01:03:15,172 --> 01:03:19,239
<i>I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.</i>

559
01:03:20,972 --> 01:03:24,406
<i>Nobody loves you.
Nobody loves you.</i>

560
01:03:27,439 --> 01:03:29,403
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

561
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,840
Agh!

562
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:18,173
No!

563
01:09:12,406 --> 01:09:13,903
Vera!

564
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:18,440
Vera!

565
01:09:21,005 --> 01:09:22,373
Ssh!

566
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:34,274
Ssh!

567
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,470
Ssh... in here.

568
01:09:38,472 --> 01:09:44,873
At that door, one two, three.

569
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:51,004
No! No! Wait!

570
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:54,539
Wait!

571
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,037
Wait!

572
01:12:19,305 --> 01:12:22,238
Hang in there, okay?
We're here to help.

573
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,003
- Easy, easy.
- Don't you fucking touch her!

574
01:12:25,005 --> 01:12:26,402
Don't you come any closer.

575
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:28,939
Back off! Back off!
Back the fuck off!

576
01:12:30,504 --> 01:12:32,402
Okay.

577
01:12:32,404 --> 01:12:33,904
You're doing really good, girls.

578
01:12:33,906 --> 01:12:36,373
- Don't you fucking...
- I promise.

579
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:46,337
Patrol 10 to dispatch.
I've got a situation here.

580
01:12:46,339 --> 01:12:48,437
Tell me who did this to you?

581
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:51,936
A witch, and an ogre.

582
01:12:51,938 --> 01:12:55,103
They came for us, at Aunt
Clarisse's.

583
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,603
About 14, 15, slender...

584
01:12:57,605 --> 01:13:00,369
one's blonde, the other
brunette. Over.

585
01:13:00,371 --> 01:13:05,369
It was two fucking men...
in a candy truck.

586
01:13:05,371 --> 01:13:06,536
A candy truck?

587
01:13:06,538 --> 01:13:07,870
<i>You read me?</i>

588
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:09,271
I read you, John.

589
01:13:09,273 --> 01:13:10,470
<i>I'm at the gas station.</i>

590
01:13:10,472 --> 01:13:12,337
<i>Janet says she saw the girls
you described!</i>

591
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:14,302
Are you kidding me?

592
01:13:14,304 --> 01:13:16,237
I swear to God!

593
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,569
Hold on, can you tell me
where Aunt Clarisse lives?

594
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:20,071
<i>Janet said they were going...</i>

595
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:21,271
<i>to Clarisse Jourdan's
old house...</i>

596
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:22,604
<i>at the corner of Holly Flowers
and Jackson.</i>

597
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:23,637
I know the place.

598
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:25,170
<i>They were with their mother.</i>

599
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:26,337
<i>Janet talked to one
of the girls.</i>

600
01:13:26,339 --> 01:13:27,436
<i>She's sure they're the ones.</i>

601
01:13:27,438 --> 01:13:29,937
For Christ's sake, John,
send a team!

602
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:32,336
We'll stop at the hospital
and head straight over!

603
01:13:32,338 --> 01:13:34,338
<i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>

604
01:13:38,905 --> 01:13:42,270
Cooper! I got some info!

605
01:13:42,272 --> 01:13:45,604
We have to go! I know where
the girls come from.

606
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:52,569
Beth! Beth! Look at me!

607
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,203
Come back!

608
01:14:55,205 --> 01:14:58,104
Beth!

609
01:14:58,106 --> 01:15:01,840
Why? No!

610
01:15:20,404 --> 01:15:21,972
No!

611
01:15:24,405 --> 01:15:26,140
Beth!

612
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:07,637
You look wonderful as always.

613
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:09,970
Thank you so much.
Thanks for coming.

614
01:16:09,972 --> 01:16:11,469
- Thanks for the invitation.
- Of course, enjoy.

615
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:12,473
I will.

616
01:16:19,305 --> 01:16:21,103
You look beautiful.

617
01:16:21,105 --> 01:16:24,036
You, too. Your world is
perfect, honey.

618
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:29,039
A most beautiful dream in a most
beautiful world.

619
01:16:31,905 --> 01:16:33,036
- Hi.
- Hi.

620
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:34,503
James, this is my mother.

621
01:16:34,505 --> 01:16:36,871
Pleased to meet you.

622
01:16:36,873 --> 01:16:39,436
Do you think I could steal her
away for a minute?

623
01:16:39,438 --> 01:16:40,937
Yes.

624
01:16:40,939 --> 01:16:43,073
Right this way.

625
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,872
Thank you.

626
01:16:56,104 --> 01:16:58,338
See where Mom is? Wave to Mom.

627
01:17:20,405 --> 01:17:22,840
It's not really your scene,
is it?

628
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:28,871
Not exactly, no.

629
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:30,903
I figured as much.

630
01:17:30,905 --> 01:17:34,903
Even less so when I have
just finished reading.

631
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:37,136
Oh god.

632
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:38,903
What?

633
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:43,202
Uh, I have waited my entire life
for this moment...

634
01:17:43,204 --> 01:17:44,937
and now it's finally arrived...

635
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:48,202
and I would rather die
than hear you say that...

636
01:17:48,204 --> 01:17:52,007
Your novel is a masterpiece.

637
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:55,436
What?

638
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:57,370
You heard me perfectly.

639
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:01,003
If you change even one word
in that book...

640
01:18:01,005 --> 01:18:04,373
I will never speak to you again.

641
01:18:09,438 --> 01:18:12,637
Thank you... thank you.

642
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:15,070
I mean...

643
01:18:15,072 --> 01:18:18,069
Thank you so much,
Mr. Lovecraft.

644
01:18:18,071 --> 01:18:19,506
Howard.

645
01:18:53,272 --> 01:18:56,373
Help me!

646
01:19:01,906 --> 01:19:03,306
Vera!

647
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:08,570
Don't listen to her, Beth.

648
01:19:08,572 --> 01:19:10,369
There's nothing left for you
there.

649
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:13,303
Beth!

650
01:19:13,305 --> 01:19:16,237
She's my sister, Mom.

651
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,436
Her world is an ugly place
to be, honey.

652
01:19:19,438 --> 01:19:22,139
But she's still my sister.

653
01:19:24,504 --> 01:19:26,269
You sure you wanna do that?

654
01:19:26,271 --> 01:19:29,935
Beth!

655
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:32,337
Yes.

656
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:33,540
Go, baby.

657
01:19:38,137 --> 01:19:39,472
Go.

658
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:35,840
Agh!

659
01:20:41,606 --> 01:20:44,506
Help! Help me!

660
01:21:22,305 --> 01:21:24,035
Agh!

661
01:21:30,038 --> 01:21:33,470
No!

662
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:36,306
Don't move. Step away.

663
01:21:38,272 --> 01:21:40,540
Hands up! Slow...

664
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:45,540
Do it now. Hands up!

665
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:53,573
Don't fucking move!

666
01:21:56,606 --> 01:21:58,338
Don't.

667
01:24:04,404 --> 01:24:06,306
I love you.

668
01:25:01,505 --> 01:25:05,569
Okay, Beth, we're about 30 or 40
minutes from the hospital.

669
01:25:05,571 --> 01:25:10,906
I'm afraid until then,
you're stuck with me.

670
01:25:14,137 --> 01:25:18,902
You're very strong, you know?
You're very brave.

671
01:25:18,904 --> 01:25:22,103
I bet you like to play sports.
Do you play sports, Beth?

672
01:25:22,105 --> 01:25:23,602
No.

673
01:25:23,604 --> 01:25:27,205
No? Well, I would've lost
that bet.

674
01:25:29,072 --> 01:25:30,540
I like to write stories.

675
