00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:29,673
"A curse created by someone
who died with strong hatred in their heart."

"before their death, and grows.“

“Those who it touches die,
and a new curse is born.“

6
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:49,099
We're visiting a house where we've received
a report of child abuse.

7
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:50,669
We're going to check it out.

8
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:54,941
I'm here with...

9
00:00:56,902 --> 00:01:00,941
...Yoshizaki from the Child Welfare Center
and a police officer.

10
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:04,375
-My name is Yamamoto,
-Hello?

11
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:06,277
and I'm with the prefeclural
child services department.

12
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:08,781
This is the police. Please open the door.

13
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,118
ls anyone home?

14
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,457
I'll check the back.

15
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:35,012
This is the police. I'm coming inside.

16
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:49,053
- It smells terrible.
-This is the police.

17
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:51,034
ls anyone home?

18
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:56,694
There's clothing
and partially eaten food everywhere.

19
00:01:56,695 --> 00:02:00,231
Mom? Dad? I'm with the Child Welfare Center!

20
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,700
This does not appear

21
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:04,874
to be a good environment for a child.

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,543
This is the police. ls anyone home?

23
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,553
Toshio?

24
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,584
We're going upstairs.

25
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:23,532
This is the police. ls anyone home?

26
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,504
ls anyone home?

27
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,210
Mom? Dad?

28
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:44,210
Toshio?

29
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:52,928
Toshio?

30
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,599
What's wrong?

31
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:08,276
Please don't touch anything. I'll call HQ.

32
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,278
Did you find something?

33
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,276
The body of a child.

34
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:14,512
Was it Toshio?

35
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:18,252
I don't know. It's been several days
since he died.

36
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:32,261
"Yui"

37
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,956
You want me to teach the class?

38
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:43,667
Yes. I'd like you
to take a class of the 3rd graders.

39
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:47,967
But the new quarter has already started.

40
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:52,210
One of the teachers has quit suddenly
for personal reasons.

41
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,511
But I only have my substitute
teacher's license,

42
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:59,677
and I've never been a homeroom teacher.

43
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:03,592
I'm aware. We've chosen you anyway.

44
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:06,953
First quarter has only just begun.

45
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:10,665
You've got a lot of time
to get to know your students.

46
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:15,096
You can learn on the job, Miss Shouno

47
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:35,450
"Yui"

48
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:39,850
Okay, I'll come to you again
once I've revised the script.

49
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,553
Alright. Contact me when it's ready.

50
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:43,328
Yes.

51
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:45,996
Thank you.

52
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:52,307
How'd it go?

53
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:57,209
I've got a job.
I'm an elementary school teacher!

54
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:59,545
That's great. Congratulations, Yui.

55
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,372
Listen to this, Naoto!

56
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:05,344
I'm a homeroom teacher, too!

57
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,712
That's great. It's a lot better

58
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:09,953
than just being a substitute.

59
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,852
I'll buy us some wine this evening,
and we can celebrate.

60
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:16,325
Okay, thanks. Talk to you later.

61
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:59,732
JU-ON: The Beginning of the End

62
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:05,971
I was so sure I wouldn't get a job
since the school year's already started.

63
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,671
"Class 3-3 Documentation"

64
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,312
They said the last teacher quit suddenly.

65
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:11,815
Did they get married?

66
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:15,979
I don't think so. It was a male teacher.

67
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,216
“Class 3-3“

68
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:21,322
But that's good luck for you.

69
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:28,364
Hmm...l wonder if I'm really going
to be able to do this.

70
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,672
I'm not really ready for it.

71
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,499
You'll be fine.

72
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,413
Just be happy you got the job,
and enjoy yourself.

73
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:39,982
This is what you wanted.

74
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:42,244
Yeah.

75
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:44,779
You're right.

76
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,249
I'll have to work hard to catch up to you.

77
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:52,791
What about you?
ls your movie script going well?

78
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:56,132
Well, they're interested.

79
00:07:56,888 --> 00:08:02,429
I see. I can't wait to go with you
to see the movie you wrote.

80
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:10,743
‘Yui Shouno"

81
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,816
My name is Yui Shouno.

82
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,812
If there's something
you're not sure about, just ask me.

83
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,478
Okay!

84
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:20,589
Be seated.

85
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,427
Toshio Saeki.

86
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,881
"Toshio Saeki"

87
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,847
This is the seventh day in a row
he's been absent.

88
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,863
I'll take attendance.

89
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:06,490
Yuuya Aida.

90
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:07,299
Present.

91
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,293
Katsuki Asanaga.

92
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:09,897
Present.

93
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:16,003
Hello, you've reached the Saeki household.

94
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:18,673
We're not currently available...

95
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,878
Please leave a message.

96
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:59,387
Toshio Saeki. He's been absent
with no word from his parents.

97
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:03,486
I phoned his home several times
during lunch but no one answered.

98
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:07,792
I've asked someone else
to handle my classes for the day.

99
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:11,093
I'm going to his house.

100
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,939
I've read the records Mr. Konishi left.

101
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:20,940
This is the seventh day in a row
he's been absent.

102
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,547
ls Toshio sick?

103
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:27,944
I don't know the details.

104
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:32,719
Has no one gone to check on him
after Mr. Konishi?

105
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:36,952
Mr. Konishi met with his parents
and spoke with them.

106
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:39,027
We haven't simply been ignoring them.

107
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:42,588
That's true, but...

108
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:48,965
From now on, you're Toshio Saeki's teacher.

109
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:59,436
Goodbye, teacher!

110
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:00,973
Goodbye.

111
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:34,577
"Nanami"

112
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,019
Look at Nanami‘s face.

113
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,024
Hey, where are you going?

114
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,417
You'll see!

115
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:49,553
There's really a ghost, right Aoi?

116
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:50,120
A ghost?

117
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,054
It's true!

118
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:52,589
I heard it!

119
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,657
Seriously?

120
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,228
What did you hear?

121
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:58,507
Nanami!

122
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,400
You don't have to be scared.
It won't attack you.

123
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,105
Stop it.

124
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:07,047
Nanami gets scared easily.

125
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:14,049
They say nobody lives there
but you can hear a child's voice.

126
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:20,656
It's haunted by a ghost!

127
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,595
Rina! Aoi! Stop it!

128
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:24,921
Who told you that?

129
00:12:24,922 --> 00:12:25,889
I don't know!

130
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,090
It's a secret!

131
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:28,091
You know, right Aoi?

132
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:29,969
I don't know!

133
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,767
It's fine, Nanami.

134
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,840
Hurry!

135
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:41,107
Here we are! This is the place.

136
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:43,148
This?

137
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:46,086
It's just a normal house.

138
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,120
Let's go.

139
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:54,588
“For Rent"

140
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,688
We're really going inside?

141
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,728
Of course we are!
Why else would we come here?

142
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:11,107
Aoi‘s sister is a real estate
agent who's in charge of this house.

143
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,113
Come on, guys!

144
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,541
But are we really allowed inside?

145
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,480
We're looking at a house
we might want to rent. It's fine!

146
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,954
I'll wait out here.

147
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:30,190
We can't leave you alone with the ghost!

148
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:31,497
Yayoi!

149
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:33,429
Come on.

150
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:48,281
Hello?

151
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:32,328
This isn't what I was expecting.

152
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:37,031
Of course. She's trying to rent
this place out.

153
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:40,328
Did you think it was going to be like
a haunted house at an amusement park?

154
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,294
It's really clean.

155
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:46,371
I bet there's not even a single cockroach.

156
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:53,405
This is so boring.

157
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:18,273
Aoi!

158
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:23,611
What was your sister saying about this house?

159
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:26,875
That nobody wants to rent it.

160
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:29,072
Liar! You were saying the house was cursed.

161
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,241
- I'm not lying!
-You're lying!

162
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:33,476
There's just these creepy stories, she said!

163
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:34,444
That's not what you said!

164
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:35,178
His!

165
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:36,246
ls not!

166
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:40,286
Hey, you two. Stop messing around.

167
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:45,388
Fine, fine.

168
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,097
She said you hear laughter
and footsteps and stuff.

169
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:04,052
Yayoi?

170
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:06,114
What are you doing?

171
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:08,079
This was on the floor.

172
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,116
What is it?

173
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:15,151
What's up?

174
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:16,324
It's kind of creepy.

175
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,323
That's weird.

176
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:24,305
What is this picture?

177
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,308
The face is all red!

178
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:27,632
He's on fire.

179
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,499
What? That's hilarious.

180
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,638
Yeah!

181
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,035
Look, his jaw's all screwed up.

182
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,743
Somebody's a worse artist than Aoi!

183
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,317
This is the worst one, I think.

184
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:40,053
- Yeah.
-it's a mess!

185
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:35,537
Who's there?

186
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,395
Who's there?

187
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:06,400
What?

188
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:14,715
What's going on?

189
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,690
Rina? Aoi? Who's there?

190
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:24,692
Stop screwing around
and open the door! Please!

191
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,696
Who's there? Who's there?

192
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,719
What's wrong, Nanami?

193
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,758
You look so pale. What happened?

194
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,256
Are you okay?

195
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,735
Did you see something scary?

196
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,737
Terrifying isn't it?

197
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:16,744
Did you see a ghost?

198
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,141
Did you see a ghost, Nanami?

199
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,625
"Kayako"

200
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:10,729
Toshio?

201
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:32,014
Mrs. Saeki?

202
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,821
Are you there, Mrs. Saeki?

203
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,373
Excuse me.

204
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,446
I'm coming inside.

205
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:17,523
My name is Shouno, I'm Toshio's new teacher.

206
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:27,142
I'm Kayako, Toshio's mother.

207
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,738
So...how is Toshio?

208
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:37,008
His father took him.

209
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,546
To the hospital?

210
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:45,784
Please, come inside.

211
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,053
ls he sick?

212
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:52,868
He'll be home soon.

213
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,299
Toshio?

214
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,939
ls that you, Toshio?

215
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,470
ls something wrong?

216
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:46,733
I'm sorry. I wanted to see Toshio‘s room.

217
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:50,702
This isn't Toshio's room.

218
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:54,075
I'm sorry, I should've asked...

219
00:24:56,406 --> 00:24:58,545
I've made some tea.

220
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:02,089
Please have some.

221
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:11,020
Ma'am?

222
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,103
Ma'am?

223
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:09,543
"Yayoi"

224
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,157
Aizawa!

225
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:22,224
Aizawa!

226
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:25,199
She's open! Aizawa!

227
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:27,627
What's wrong, Yayoi? Are you okay?

228
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,237
Rest a bit. Switch out!

229
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,766
You can rest.

230
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:34,167
-Okay, remember to yell nice and loud!
-Are you okay?

231
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:16,717
Okay, remember to yell!

232
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:47,247
ls someone there?

233
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:53,311
Excuse me.

234
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:56,845
Nurse?

235
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:39,689
What is this?

236
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:43,426
What the hell is this?

237
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,227
Ma'am?

238
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:19,296
This is the 10th day Toshio‘s been absent
without permission.

239
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:20,959
Without permission?

240
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:25,802
His mom spoke to you,
right? When you went there?

241
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:29,639
But I didn't get to see Toshio.

242
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:33,646
What is it that you want to do?

243
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:38,718
If you're that worried, go see his mom again.

244
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,545
But...

245
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:48,062
There was something not right about that woman.

246
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:51,996
You mustn't say things like that!

247
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:55,503
If one of the parents heard that...

248
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,205
I'm sorry.

249
00:31:58,528 --> 00:31:59,836
Be more careful.

250
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:02,501
Um...

251
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:08,577
ls it possible for me to meet Mr. Konishi,
the last teacher?

252
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:16,556
Alright.

253
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:21,152
He's dead.

254
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:25,531
Mr. Konishi is dead.

255
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:30,036
I received word from his family this morning.

256
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:43,477
I visited Toshio Saeki's house yesterday.

257
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,451
His mother was there.

258
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:50,854
I asked about Toshio,
but she just stood in the front hall

259
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,288
and said he was resting, over and over again.

260
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:57,694
I never was able to see him.

261
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:02,727
I'm going back there after school today.

262
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:37,400
I'm back.

263
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:40,404
Huh?

264
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,379
Why are you sitting in the dark?

265
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:59,389
There's a kid in class who isn't coming
to school.

266
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,393
It must be hard to be a teacher.

267
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,890
Which kid?

268
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:09,832
The one on the far left in the front row.
His name's Toshio Saeki.

269
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,432
Bullying?

270
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:14,402
I don't think so.

271
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:17,036
He doesn't look that weird.

272
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:21,405
I'll make dinner.

273
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:24,978
It's fine, you're hungry right?
Let's go somewhere.

274
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:29,418
Yeah, okay. I'll get changed.

275
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:49,442
Stand up!

276
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:56,482
Attention!

277
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,540
Good morning!

278
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:04,485
Be seated.

279
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:19,030
Anyway, my wife is waiting.

280
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:27,470
The young man found himself walking
a narrow road, deep in the mountains.

281
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:31,183
The damp fog...

282
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:43,529
Toshio?

283
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,070
Stop that.

284
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:54,502
Toshio?

285
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,511
Stop it, Toshio.

286
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:27,100
"Rina"

287
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:45,950
I'm sorry. Rina can't see anyone right now.

288
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,559
Please!

289
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:59,639
Rina is our friend!

290
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:19,587
Rina?

291
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:23,589
Rina?

292
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:38,078
This room doesn't have a lock.

293
00:37:47,977 --> 00:37:49,217
Rina!

294
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:08,637
Rina...

295
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,139
Rina?

296
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:19,517
Rina!

297
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,054
Where are you?

298
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:29,093
Aoi...over there.

299
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,795
They're coming.

300
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:41,596
They're coming!

301
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:42,598
What?

302
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:46,038
They're coming! They're coming!

303
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:49,041
T-the white child...

304
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:51,044
What are you talking about?

305
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:55,177
Aoi! Help me! Aoi!

306
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:56,578
Calm down!

307
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,753
Please, save me!

308
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,060
Save me!

309
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,134
What's going on?

310
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:15,372
AoimAoi, let's go.

311
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:18,433
Let's go! Come with me!

312
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:19,606
Wait!

313
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:28,081
This is a charm. You can have it.

314
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,143
Aoi! Hurry!

315
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:54,170
Rina...

316
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:57,117
I know!

317
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:03,445
Rina, we'll come back.

318
00:40:03,446 --> 00:40:05,119
Aoi, we can't stay here!

319
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:13,700
The white child...
the while child's curse will kill me.

320
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:17,129
The while child!
The while child! The white child!

321
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,568
Stop it!

322
00:44:42,992 --> 00:44:44,596
Teacher...

323
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:11,725
"Teacher's Office"

324
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:18,027
Mrs. Saeki?

325
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,777
Mrs. Saeki?

326
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:42,694
Mrs. Saeki?

327
00:45:52,428 --> 00:45:53,998
Mrs. Saeki?

328
00:46:50,653 --> 00:46:53,634
What's this? A diary?

329
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:27,567
You're back.

330
00:47:36,432 --> 00:47:37,274
Yui?

331
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:51,683
Yui?

332
00:48:14,003 --> 00:48:15,277
Yui?

333
00:48:23,646 --> 00:48:24,647
Yui!

334
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:37,869
Toshio...

335
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:04,961
"Class 3-3 Documentation"

336
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:07,460
"Toshio Saeki"

337
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:33,126
I moved to the house on the hill today.

338
00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:39,130
This is exactly the kind of place

339
00:49:39,288 --> 00:49:41,598
I'd always wanted to raise a kid.

340
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:46,598
I'm sure you'll find this house
beautiful too, my child.

341
00:49:46,762 --> 00:49:49,606
I went to look for clothes for you, my child.

342
00:49:49,832 --> 00:49:53,234
Just looking at the tiny clothes and shoes

343
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:56,546
was enough to make me short of breath...

344
00:49:56,638 --> 00:49:59,881
I bought a picture book
I think you'd want to read.

345
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:03,420
Whenever I read it, it's strange...

346
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:06,886
I feel like you're right beside me...

347
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:10,151
I can't wait to play with you
in this huge living room.

348
00:50:10,152 --> 00:50:13,287
I tried changing the way I walk,

349
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:17,202
like there was a soft ball in my tummy, but...

350
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:22,326
The last few days I was sure
I'd finally become a mother.

351
00:50:23,132 --> 00:50:24,365
But I was wrong.

352
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:26,667
God, is it my fault you won't give me a child?

353
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:29,437
Did I do something wrong?

354
00:50:29,438 --> 00:50:31,372
This house is hell.

355
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:35,343
I stood under the waterfall at a nearby shrine.

356
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:39,047
I was unclean.

357
00:50:39,048 --> 00:50:40,681
My body is so clean now.

358
00:50:40,682 --> 00:50:44,652
The temperature of my body
is perfect for your arrival.

359
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:46,220
I purified myself.

360
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:50,033
A single thread will connect you to my belly.

361
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:51,759
It's so mysterious.

362
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,761
I'm disappointed.

363
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:56,364
Takeo's always away on business.

364
00:50:56,365 --> 00:51:00,468
That's why it's taking so long for you
to get here.

365
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:02,336
It's Takeo‘s fault.

366
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:03,971
Please, god.

367
00:51:03,972 --> 00:51:06,919
Pour a soul into my body.

368
00:51:07,176 --> 00:51:10,157
I can't take this anymore. I want a child.

369
00:51:10,946 --> 00:51:15,452
I don't care whose child it is!
Let me give birth to it!

370
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:20,166
I want a child!
A child...a child...a child...

371
00:51:20,355 --> 00:51:26,931
A child! A child! A child! A child!

372
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,120
It's been so long since I've written here,

373
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:43,548
but something wonderful has happened.

374
00:51:45,114 --> 00:51:47,094
Takeo was away, as always,

375
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:53,626
and I was alone in my bed on the second floor.

376
00:51:54,723 --> 00:52:01,038
And then a boy came to me.

377
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:07,710
He called me mother.

378
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:14,146
I know I must be pregnant.

379
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,121
I'm sure of it.

380
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:24,222
Takeo knows nothing.

381
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:27,123
He won't know until the day he dies.

382
00:52:28,056 --> 00:52:31,003
It's a secret between me and my child.

383
00:52:31,894 --> 00:52:37,003
Takeo will play the role of his father.

384
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:42,573
I came up with the name Toshio.

385
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:48,677
Toshio...Toshio...Toshio...

386
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,691
It's such a lovely name.

387
00:53:12,668 --> 00:53:17,344
"Aoi"

388
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:28,562
Why are you spacing out? Romance problems?

389
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:33,562
No!

390
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:39,064
Hey...

391
00:53:40,162 --> 00:53:45,111
Remember when we were talking about
that haunted house?

392
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:50,582
Yeah...maybe.

393
00:53:51,974 --> 00:53:57,219
Sis, wait...is that true?

394
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,992
You said you couldn't find anyone
to rent it because of a ghost.

395
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:05,665
It has nothing to do with you.

396
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:08,662
Tell me!

397
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:11,965
I want to know the details.

398
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:13,672
Aoi.

399
00:54:14,496 --> 00:54:16,669
You didn't go there, did you?

400
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:22,111
Of course not! Not if you're telling me
there's a ghost there.

401
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:24,278
I hope so...

402
00:54:25,774 --> 00:54:26,741
That place...

403
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:30,690
Stop it, Kyosuke.
We've finally almost found a renter.

404
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:34,461
Somebody's going to rent that place?

405
00:54:42,124 --> 00:54:43,694
You went, didn't you?

406
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:48,468
You didn't go inside though, right?

407
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:54,302
No way!

408
00:54:54,303 --> 00:54:55,714
Stop it, seriously.

409
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,744
Aoi, go take a bath.

410
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,296
It's your fault
for talking about that stuff at home.

411
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:27,741
Rina...

412
00:55:29,604 --> 00:55:31,208
What happened to you?

413
00:55:35,177 --> 00:55:36,747
Yayoi?

414
00:55:38,246 --> 00:55:40,248
Where did you go?

415
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:53,265
I'm sorry...

416
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,068
Aoi?

417
00:56:25,127 --> 00:56:26,128
Aoi?

418
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:29,836
Aoi?

419
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:57,463
I'm sorry.

420
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:11,810
Rina?

421
00:58:12,634 --> 00:58:13,612
Aoi?

422
00:58:16,304 --> 00:58:17,282
Rina?

423
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:18,908
Aoi!

424
00:58:50,205 --> 00:58:51,309
Nanami.

425
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:24,082
What?

426
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,070
What?

427
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:03,615
Let me go!

428
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:11,129
I'm sorry.

429
01:00:13,388 --> 01:00:14,696
I'm sorry.

430
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:20,471
I'm sor-

431
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,447
No one's living here now
so you can move in immediately.

432
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:40,817
It's nice and bright!

433
01:00:45,086 --> 01:00:48,956
You told her about this place, didn't you?

434
01:00:48,957 --> 01:00:51,403
Yes. Kayako...

435
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:54,497
My wife, she knows about it.

436
01:00:56,498 --> 01:00:59,700
Normally it's the wife
who's against these things.

437
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:02,648
I'm sure. It would be weird if she wasn't.

438
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:09,076
If it's a problem, Mr. Saeki...

439
01:01:09,077 --> 01:01:10,249
Takeo!

440
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:15,855
Let's move here. It's wonderful.

441
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:35,514
" Naoto"

442
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:13,252
So you're with the school.

443
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:17,144
Yes. The child who lives there
isn't coming to school,

444
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:18,624
so I came to you.

445
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,187
I see. Alright.

446
01:02:24,652 --> 01:02:26,859
Mr. Saeki‘s not picking up.

447
01:02:30,925 --> 01:02:33,906
What is his family like?

448
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:38,306
A normal family.
Husband and wife and one child.

449
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:41,580
The front door was left open.

450
01:02:46,074 --> 01:02:49,409
I see. Then I'll go pay a visit tomorrow.

451
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:50,912
ls there anything...

452
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,659
...going on with that family?

453
01:02:56,117 --> 01:02:57,152
Anything?

454
01:02:57,619 --> 01:02:59,155
If you know anything...

455
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:03,497
I can't share any information
about our renters.

456
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:08,003
Toshio Saeki‘s teacher
is someone I'm very close to.

457
01:03:10,198 --> 01:03:11,575
And she's...

458
01:03:12,934 --> 01:03:15,175
She's been acting weird ever since
she went there.

459
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:18,678
Tell me, please. I want to save her!

460
01:03:24,245 --> 01:03:25,849
It's not the family.

461
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:28,255
Huh?

462
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:34,190
It's the house that's strange.

463
01:03:35,456 --> 01:03:36,230
The house?

464
01:03:39,093 --> 01:03:41,300
I told Mr. Saeki about it.

465
01:03:41,362 --> 01:03:43,263
We're required by law

466
01:03:43,264 --> 01:03:45,210
to notify them about that stuff.

467
01:03:48,469 --> 01:03:50,210
What happened?

468
01:03:58,613 --> 01:04:01,526
A child died.

469
01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:04,252
A child?

470
01:04:11,025 --> 01:04:13,562
19 years ago,

471
01:04:14,495 --> 01:04:16,532
a child was left alone inside
that house during a heat wave.

472
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,241
I see.

473
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:24,905
Thank you.

474
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:27,250
It's not just a rumor!

475
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:40,660
If your friend...

476
01:04:42,156 --> 01:04:45,296
has gone inside that house,
you should be careful.

477
01:04:48,663 --> 01:04:49,767
10 years ago...

478
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:55,773
My wife and her little sister went inside
that house.

479
01:04:57,772 --> 01:04:59,274
They just went inside, that's all.

480
01:05:05,513 --> 01:05:06,992
That was all, but...

481
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,486
"Child Starves in House,“

482
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:47,621
“Locked inside in a room for 7 days
in hot weather"

483
01:05:47,622 --> 01:05:48,930
This is it...

484
01:05:49,891 --> 01:05:54,795
Child welfare received a report

485
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:57,197
from a neighbor about possible child abuse.

486
01:05:57,198 --> 01:05:58,198
"Locked in room in hot weather for 7 days,"

487
01:05:58,199 --> 01:05:59,199
"Hands and feet bound"

488
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,001
A child's body was found
in a second floor bedroom

489
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:03,337
with its hands and feet tied.

490
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:05,939
It was later learned that
the child was Toshio Yamaga,

491
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,648
the eldest son of the house.

492
01:06:12,413 --> 01:06:13,414
Toshio...

493
01:06:28,663 --> 01:06:31,473
"Toshio Yamaga"

494
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:39,677
10 years ago...

495
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:44,387
My wife and her little sister went inside
that house.

496
01:06:48,282 --> 01:06:49,784
They just went inside, that's all.

497
01:06:53,454 --> 01:06:54,831
That was all, but...

498
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,418
Yui!

499
01:07:43,471 --> 01:07:44,449
Yui!

500
01:07:45,406 --> 01:07:47,909
Yui! Yui!

501
01:08:06,961 --> 01:08:11,910
"Scanning.

502
01:08:29,617 --> 01:08:30,561
I knew it.

503
01:08:32,587 --> 01:08:34,032
It's the same face.

504
01:08:36,424 --> 01:08:38,062
What's going on?

505
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:36,552
Naoto?

506
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:47,596
Naoto?

507
01:09:55,436 --> 01:09:56,574
Naoto?

508
01:11:10,978 --> 01:11:15,518
"Toshio"

509
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:28,843
July 28th, 2005.

510
01:14:28,943 --> 01:14:31,423
Toshio has come to our home!

511
01:14:36,984 --> 01:14:38,486
Look at the camera again.

512
01:14:39,954 --> 01:14:41,934
Okay, baah!

513
01:14:42,556 --> 01:14:44,001
Baah!

514
01:14:45,059 --> 01:14:46,129
Our baby.

515
01:14:47,061 --> 01:14:48,472
What's going on?

516
01:14:49,029 --> 01:14:49,929
‘Saeki Takeo Kayako Toshio"

517
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,797
You made it already?

518
01:14:50,798 --> 01:14:53,800
Okay, there's our name plate.

519
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:58,045
Thank you so much! This is Toshio Saeki!

520
01:15:12,152 --> 01:15:15,759
Okay, look over here, Toshio! With your dad!

521
01:15:16,624 --> 01:15:19,764
Toshio, hold your dad's hand.

522
01:15:21,495 --> 01:15:23,099
What's wrong?

523
01:15:23,664 --> 01:15:24,797
It's your dad!

524
01:15:24,798 --> 01:15:25,798
'7th Birthday Party"

525
01:15:25,799 --> 01:15:27,073
He's not scary!

526
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:47,687
Okay, Toshio. Your mom made lunch!

527
01:15:47,688 --> 01:15:50,294
Put it down for a second and look over here.

528
01:15:50,491 --> 01:15:54,794
Toshio! Look over here! Toshio!

529
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:56,829
Toshio! Call me daddy!

530
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:57,497
Why are you looking at me like that?

531
01:15:57,498 --> 01:15:58,772
Stop it! He doesn't like that!

532
01:17:01,562 --> 01:17:02,506
Huh?

533
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:56,560
Mom?

534
01:18:10,364 --> 01:18:11,638
Mom?

535
01:18:43,564 --> 01:18:44,668
Who is it?

536
01:18:45,566 --> 01:18:47,273
Whose child is that?

537
01:18:56,376 --> 01:18:59,112
Tell me whose child it is! Tell me! Tell me!

538
01:18:59,113 --> 01:19:00,353
It's my child.

539
01:19:01,749 --> 01:19:03,353
And only my child.

540
01:19:04,318 --> 01:19:08,289
Toshio is only my child.

541
01:19:08,355 --> 01:19:12,633
You didn't have anything to do with his birth.

542
01:19:12,893 --> 01:19:17,842
You don't have a child.

543
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:55,613
Mom...

544
01:23:29,616 --> 01:23:31,118
Teacher...

545
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,999
Save me...

546
01:23:37,524 --> 01:23:39,470
Save me...

547
01:24:59,573 --> 01:25:00,574
Mom.

548
01:25:05,145 --> 01:25:06,522
Mom.

549
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:39,551
Yui!

550
01:25:40,247 --> 01:25:43,091
It's time! You need to get ready!
