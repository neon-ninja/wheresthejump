PET
SEMATARY

3
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,655
So many trees.

4
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:07,490
It's beautiful, right?

5
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,693
Well, it's definitely
not Boston.

6
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,594
No, it's not.

7
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:14,499
Mom, make him stop.
It's not fair to Church.

8
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,734
I'm pretty sure Church is okay.

9
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,803
It's not actually Church
that I'm worried about.

10
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,471
We've still got
another eight hours to go.

11
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:22,539
What?

12
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:24,810
Not funny, Dad.

13
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,676
That is so funny.

14
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,813
I got you good.

15
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,484
- Gage, did you find that funny?
- I thought it was funny.

16
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,755
What do you think?

17
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,126
- Wow.
- "Wow"? That's it?

18
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,128
It's pretty incredible,
don't you think?

19
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,963
I even got them
to throw in a whole forest

20
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,698
as a new backyard.

21
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,866
This whole place is ours?

22
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,001
This whole place
is the new domain

23
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,038
of Ellie-phant
the Great and Terrible.

24
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,638
I'll tell you what.

25
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,743
Do you want
to be the first inside?

26
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,080
Go, go, go.

27
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,682
The movers
were here all morning,

28
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,384
so everything
should be inside.

29
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,819
Good.

30
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,858
Son of a bitch. You okay?

31
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,695
Yeah, it just startled me
a little bit.

32
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,598
You okay, Gage?

33
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,900
- Big truck, huh?
- Who's a brave boy?

34
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,670
That was a big
truck, wasn't it?

35
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:01,073
Okay. You ready,
little man?

36
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:05,911
- Here we go. Come on.
- One, two, three!

37
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:06,812
Home.

38
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,347
Hmm.

39
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,883
Well, he adapted quickly.

40
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:14,719
What about you?
You ready for the country life, Doc?

41
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,689
- Well, let's find out. Come on.-

42
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,890
Mrs. Creed.

43
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,029
Wait, the cat's in the car!

44
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:34,575
This all happened
pretty fast. You gonna miss it?

45
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:38,844
I don't think anyone really misses
the graveyard shift in the ER.

46
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,414
I don't think that really
answered my question.

47
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,384
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

48
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,922
- Hey.
- Hmm?

49
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,225
You needed this.

50
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:54,127
We needed this.

51
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,066
I get to spend some more
time around the house

52
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:03,302
- with the kids.
- And your stay-at-home wifey.

53
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,071
- Ooh, I didn't even think about that.
- Yeah?

54
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,739
- I may have to rethink that.
- Oh, you will?

55
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,609
You stop that. Don't you do that.

56
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,544
Yeah...

57
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,525
Good morning, Marcella.

58
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:24,824
Ready for the storm?

59
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,360
We have someone already?

60
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:28,062
Bloody nose. Room 4.

61
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,698
Sounds serious.

62
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:46,916
Do you hear that?

63
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:16,076
What are they doing?

64
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,448
Looks like some
sort of procession.

65
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,984
What's a procession?

66
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:26,856
It's like a parade,
but not for fun.

67
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,767
Hey, let's go back inside
and watch a show.

68
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,973
I'm tired of unpacking boxes.

69
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,983
Sooner than that.

70
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:57,421
I mean, Ellie's birthday is
coming up in a few months.

71
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:23,746
Well, I don't know why you're worried, Mom.
No, everything's fine.

72
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:25,516
The kids are really happy.

73
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,982
Yeah.

74
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,752
No, it's nice
to slow down a little bit,

75
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:31,021
you know?

76
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,398
Hey, Mom, can I, uh...
Can I talk to you later?

77
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,268
Okay, love you. Bye.

78
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,309
Hey, Ellie, are you hungry?

79
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:12,523
Hey. You get down from there!

80
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,007
The trick is...

81
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:34,178
To get the stinger out
real quick.

82
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,182
Oh, she's a big 'un.

83
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,384
No prize winner...

84
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:42,623
But she'll do for a ribbon.

85
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,192
There you go.

86
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,758
Yeah.

87
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,761
Should be starting
to quiet down now.

88
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:52,797
You're the doctor's
little girl.

89
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,401
Eleanor Creed.
But you can call me Ellie.

90
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:57,671
I'm Judson Crandall.

91
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,039
You can call me Jud.

92
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,243
All right. Up you get.

93
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:11,216
- What is this place?
- Pet cemetery.

94
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:15,288
- Didn't you read the sign?
- Yeah. They spelled it wrong.

95
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,824
These are all people's pets?

96
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,627
Well, the whole town's been
using this place for generations.

97
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:23,728
I saw those kids.

98
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,597
They were all
wearing those masks.

99
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,065
Yeah.

100
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:31,136
A lot of folks make a
kind of ritual out of it.

101
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:34,674
See this one over here?
I carved this myself.

102
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,943
That's my dog, Biffer.

103
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:41,582
And it's true.
He was a hell of a sniffer.

104
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,952
Ellie?

105
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:50,322
You know better than to wander
off by yourself. Come here.

106
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:53,124
Mommy, this is Jud,
our neighbor.

107
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,460
I got stung by a bee.

108
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:57,597
He pulled the stinger out.
It was a big 'un.

109
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,631
Hmm. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

110
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:02,703
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Rachel, Ellie's mom.

111
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:05,773
You know, these woods...

112
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:10,710
It's not really all that safe
to go roaming around in 'em.

113
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,446
People can get lost up here.

114
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:17,418
Thank you, Jud.
Um, we should get back, okay?

115
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,388
Honey, you can't
wander off like that.

116
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,624
I don't know where you are.
I can't do anything...

117
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:29,731
Just wash the mud off and rub
some baking soda on that sting.

118
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,735
<i>Jud...</i>

119
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:37,672
<i>Come back...</i>

120
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,349
- Dad?
- Yeah?

121
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:52,487
Why don't pets
live as long as people?

122
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:56,558
Well...

123
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,561
Do you remember that talk
we had about metabolism?

124
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,229
- The clock in your body?
- Yes.

125
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:05,566
Humans have
a slow metabolism,

126
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:08,802
a slow clock,
so we live longer.

127
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:11,005
Whereas cats and dogs...

128
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:12,906
Well, they have
a fast metabolism.

129
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:14,875
Which means,
when it runs out...

130
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:16,812
They die and go
to the pet cemetery.

131
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:18,712
Yeah.

132
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:21,247
Ellie discovered
a charming little landmark

133
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:23,684
in the woods today,
right in our backyard.

134
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:27,688
Okay. Well, that doesn't have to
be such a bad thing, does it? Hmm?

135
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,924
A place to bury our pets
and remember them.

136
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:33,495
It might seem scary, but it's not.
It's perfectly natural.

137
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:37,399
Just like dying
is natural. Hmm?

138
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,468
We all die and eventually,
one way or another,

139
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,337
we all go back
into the ground.

140
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:44,771
What Daddy's
trying to say

141
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:48,076
is that even though the pet's
body goes in the ground,

142
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,747
its soul keeps living
and goes to heaven.

143
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:53,815
Just like Nana Creed.

144
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:56,851
Remember how I told you
she's looking down on you?

145
00:12:56,853 --> 00:12:58,118
Well, we don't
actually know

146
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,188
that it works
exactly like that.

147
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,756
What Mommy and Daddy
are trying to say

148
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:05,026
is that you don't have to worry about
this, sweetheart, okay?

149
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:09,063
Church and Mommy and me,
we're gonna be around a long, long time.

150
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:10,197
And Gage?

151
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,902
Of course, sweetie.
Gage is just a kid.

152
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:19,340
But what about
your sister, Mommy?

153
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:22,545
Wasn't she just a kid
when she died?

154
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,222
Rachel...

155
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:10,761
Rachel.

156
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:14,832
You okay?

157
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,300
What was that in there?

158
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:22,771
Funny, I wanted to ask you
the same thing.

159
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:24,673
Rachel, Ellie's
almost nine years old.

160
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,341
We should be able
to talk to her about this.

161
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,243
Ellie's a child.

162
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:30,612
And death for her is scary.

163
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:32,514
Please, Rachel, doesn't mean
we should shield her from it.

164
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:34,583
And you think
that's what I'm doing?

165
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:38,589
I think that all this talk
about the afterlife,

166
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:41,523
about people
looking down on her,

167
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,792
I think...
Yeah, I think it's delaying

168
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:46,528
getting to the heart
of the matter, yes.

169
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,534
So, you... You really don't
think there's anything

170
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:55,974
after we die?
No heaven, no nothing?

171
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,711
No.

172
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,081
Right. We're gonna take a swab
and run a test for strep.

173
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,785
It could be allergies,

174
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,920
but we just want to be sure.

175
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,256
Marcella, please tell me
it's almost lunch.

176
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,925
If I have to look at another
pair of swollen tonsils,

177
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,328
- I swear to God...
- Judy went out for sandwiches.

178
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:22,233
His head!

179
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,398
Victor, uh, Pascow.

180
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,135
It's Victor Pascow.
He's a student here.

181
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:27,570
He was skating and the
car just came out of nowhere!

182
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:29,472
- He got dragged.
- Call Life Flight to Bangor.

183
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:30,807
No time for an ambulance.

184
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:32,909
We need to get his blood type.
We'll need a lot of units.

185
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,410
We have to stabilize him
before we can transfer.

186
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:35,512
He have
a medical bracelet on?

187
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:36,679
I didn't see anything, no.

188
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,817
I'm not gonna
let you die, Victor. Shit.

189
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,384
Type O-positive.
Pulling four units.

190
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:44,155
Great. Lie back, okay?
Just lie back. Lie back.

191
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:45,623
Let's hurry up
with those units, okay?

192
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,390
Kelly, we're gonna need to
fit him with a cervical collar

193
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:48,558
to get him lifted.

194
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,927
His brain. I can see it.

195
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,063
Kelly. Kelly, go!

196
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,098
Victor, please.

197
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,468
Where are we with those units?
He's losing a lot of blood!

198
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,139
No. No, no, no, Victor. No.
You stay with me, Victor.

199
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:05,209
You stay with me. I'm right here, Victor.
Stay right here...

200
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,918
Come...
Come back to me, Victor.

201
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,552
Come on.
Come back to me.

202
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,824
Come back. Come back.

203
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:22,728
God damn it.

204
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:07,205
Louis.

205
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:10,878
The barrier is not
meant to be broken.

206
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:13,814
Louis?

207
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,786
Uh, he's gone.

208
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,467
Hey.

209
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,113
What happened?

210
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:23,316
This poor kid
got hit by a car today

211
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:24,953
right on the campus.

212
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:31,526
He, uh, couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

213
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:37,131
His name was Victor Pascow.

214
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,203
I sure wasn't expecting
to see any of that up here.

215
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,841
Why don't you come inside?

216
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:51,544
I'll make you some dinner.
You can take a shower. Okay?

217
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:53,015
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,953
He, uh, knew my name.

219
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,156
What?

220
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,092
He...

221
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,931
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

222
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:18,140
Jud? It's Ellie.
I made cookies.

223
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,576
Are you home?

224
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:13,027
You in the habit
of going through

225
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,663
other people's things?

226
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:17,967
Sorry.

227
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:20,401
Is that your wife?

228
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:23,606
Yeah. Her name was Norma.

229
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:24,974
She's pretty.

230
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,976
What happened to her?

231
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:30,847
Got sick. Passed away.

232
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,416
Well, maybe she's
still out there.

233
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,451
You know,
watching from heaven?

234
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,453
You think so, Ellie?

235
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:39,889
Hey, want to come
meet my cat?

236
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,790
- His name is Church.
- Church?

237
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,859
That's short
for Winston Churchill.

238
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:46,495
He's a guy
who lived a long time ago.

239
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,364
Oh, I know
who Winston Churchill is.

240
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:50,966
Wow. You must be really old.

241
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,968
I'm afraid so.

242
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,243
Oh-ho!
- Very nice!

243
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:01,978
Very good.

244
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:05,613
- -Nice job.
Bravo, sweetheart.

245
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:08,484
- Can you clap? Clap, clap.
- Well done, honey.

246
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,085
Thanks, folks,
for having me over.

247
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,788
It's been a long time since
I've had any good home cooking.

248
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,457
How long have you lived here?

249
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:15,924
What, in Ludlow,
or in that house?

250
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,361
- Either.
- All my life.

251
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,628
To both questions.

252
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:22,432
- Whoa, big fella!
- Church!

253
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,466
- He likes you.
- Well, I like him.

254
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:26,101
Church good kitty.

255
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,336
- Hey!
- Yes.

256
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:29,338
- Church good, good kitty.
- He is.

257
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,640
- Yeah.
- I was curious, Jud...

258
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,275
Um, the realtor
said the house came

259
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,777
with over 50 acres of woods.

260
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:38,181
That pet cemetery,
do we own that, too?

261
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:40,684
Well, that's
part of your property.

262
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:44,621
How far back
is the property line?

263
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:49,059
Well, it's further
than you'd ever care to go.

264
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:07,212
<i>Louis.</i>

265
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:57,461
Come on, Doc.

266
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:26,092
<i>You tried to help me.</i>

267
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,961
<i>Now let me help you.</i>

268
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:53,052
<i>This is the place
where the dead rest.</i>

269
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:56,721
<i>Do not go on to the place</i>

270
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:59,293
<i>where the dead walk.</i>

271
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:18,910
Stop! The ground is sour!

272
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:22,316
Wake up, Dada!

273
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:25,651
Oh, hey, buddy.

274
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:27,819
Come here,
come here, come here.

275
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,288
Come to Daddy.

276
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:33,461
- I love you, Daddy.
- Hmm?

277
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:35,929
Oh, man, thank you.

278
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,165
Time for Daddy to get up.

279
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,040
Hi.

280
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,609
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

281
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:52,813
Did you wake up Dada? Huh?

282
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:54,847
- Did you wake up Dada, huh?
- What time is it?

283
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,317
It's late. You slept in.

284
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:12,500
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Ellie.

285
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:14,801
What have you guys got?

286
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:16,369
I've got some candy
corns, lollipops...

287
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:17,804
They also have
really big gummy bears.

288
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:21,575
Okay, which one is the sheet
and which one is the gho... Oh!

289
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:23,743
You look like a ghost, don't you, huh?

290
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:24,944
You've been busy already.

291
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:27,213
- You guys look great.
- Thank you.

292
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:28,414
We have to go
to the Pattersons,

293
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:31,183
- 'cause they have the biggest candy...
- El, uh...

294
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:32,918
- Take your broom, honey?
- Yeah.

295
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,019
Talk among yourselves.

296
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:35,657
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

297
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:42,131
What are you doing, Jud?
You scaring the kids?

298
00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:45,632
There's something
you need to see.

299
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,571
All right.

300
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:03,051
Oh, no. Church.

301
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:09,791
One of those
damn Orinco trucks.

302
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,292
- Dad!
- Oh, shit.

303
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:15,030
- Dad!
- Uh, we can't let Ellie see this.

304
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:17,865
Come on, we got to go
trick-or-treating

305
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,566
- with Zoe and Tyler.
- Yeah, honey.

306
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:21,601
I'm just gonna say
a quick hello to Jud.

307
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:23,303
- Okay?
- I'll put a spell on you.

308
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:25,673
You already have, sweetheart.

309
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:28,478
You go wait in the car, honey.
I'll be right there.

310
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:32,113
You, uh...
You go with the kids.

311
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:33,781
Come back later,
we'll take care of this.

312
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:39,021
Okay.

313
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:40,956
And, Louis...

314
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,394
We should do this tonight.

315
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:48,298
Sure, yeah.

316
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,170
You're sure?

317
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,173
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,642
I mean, he was all twisted.

319
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:05,113
Which brings me

320
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:08,249
to the fact
that we have to tell Ellie.

321
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,251
- No, can we just tell her...
- Rachel. No, we need...

322
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,223
Can we just tell her
that he ran away, please?

323
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:17,024
You know, honey,
I get it, okay?

324
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:20,596
I get it's difficult
for you to talk about death

325
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,430
after what you went through
with your sister,

326
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,866
but I think it's time
you finally opened up.

327
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:26,102
I'm just...

328
00:27:27,704 --> 00:27:29,738
No, I'm just
upset about Church.

329
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,441
Rachel, talk to me.
We both know this is about Zelda.

330
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:37,679
<i>Ever since moving here,
I can't stop thinking about her.</i>

331
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:38,680
<i>She hated me</i>

332
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:42,417
because my spine
wasn't twisted like hers.

333
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,989
<i>She promised me that one day
I'd end up just like her.</i>

334
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:49,492
<i>I'd never
get out of bed again.</i>

335
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:53,261
<i>My parents
left me alone with her.</i>

336
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:55,764
<i>I was supposed
to bring her dinner.</i>

337
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:59,334
<i>And so I used the dumbwaiter,
and I knew I wasn't supposed to</i>

338
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,138
<i>because it didn't work
all the time.</i>

339
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:46,685
She died in there
because of me.

340
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:52,355
I watched them
wheel her body out,

341
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,158
but I swear
she was still in the walls.

342
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:59,698
<i>And at night,
I could hear her moving,</i>

343
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,864
<i>calling out my name.</i>

344
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,334
<i>Rachel.</i>

345
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:05,935
I didn't know who to call.

346
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:08,605
But if I had just gone up to the
room and given her her food...

347
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:13,176
Your parents should never have
left you alone with her. Never.

348
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:14,712
That makes me a monster.

349
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:16,046
No, no, no, no, no, no,

350
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,548
that does not
make you a monster.

351
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,049
Come on. Hey.

352
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:21,687
That does not
make you a monster. Okay?

353
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:23,120
Mmm?

354
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:26,090
Tell you what.

355
00:29:26,092 --> 00:29:30,126
Jud and I are gonna take care of
Church tonight. All right? We'll...

356
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:34,834
We'll just tell Ellie
that he ran away.

357
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,503
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.

358
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:40,740
Just anything but dead.

359
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:56,154
I got a spot for you.

360
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:04,563
What is it?

361
00:30:06,532 --> 00:30:08,835
Nothing. Let's get this
over with, huh?

362
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:10,736
It's cold.

363
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:18,310
<i>Jud...</i>

364
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,479
<i>Jud...</i>

365
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:28,987
Ellie really loved that cat,
didn't she?

366
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:30,590
More than anything.

367
00:30:31,692 --> 00:30:33,125
And you love Ellie.

368
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,595
Well, of course.

369
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,700
So, follow me.

370
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:42,769
What?

371
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:47,274
- I know all the spots to step.
- Jud, wait.

372
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:54,414
What's the matter
with right here?

373
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,783
For Chrissakes.

374
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:06,259
Oh, what the hell am I doing?

375
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:18,473
Jud, come on, wait up.

376
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:26,613
What the hell is this place?

377
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:52,540
Come a long
way to bury a cat.

378
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:14,295
What was that?

379
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:17,031
It's just a loon.

380
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,568
Come on.

381
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:02,845
What is this place?

382
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:09,451
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

383
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,721
Bury your animal.

384
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:18,759
I'd help you,
but you have to do it yourself.

385
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:22,529
And use some of these rocks
to make a cairn.

386
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:25,400
- Kind of like the other ones.
- Okay.

387
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:50,793
What exactly are we
doing here tonight, Jud?

388
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,596
We're burying
your daughter's cat.

389
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,169
And that's all?

390
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:01,804
That and nothing but.

391
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,888
You did good, Louis.

392
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,659
I knew you would.

393
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:37,573
What time is it?

394
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,176
It's late.

395
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:43,412
Did you and Jud
take care of everything?

396
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,115
Yeah, it's done.

397
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,719
Thank you.

398
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,224
What is it?

399
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,628
It's Church, honey.

400
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,063
Yeah.

401
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:07,303
Daddy and Jud went out last
night to look for Church, and...

402
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,871
Well, we looked
all around and we...

403
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:12,077
Well, sweetheart,
we couldn't find him.

404
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,844
And so we think...

405
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,447
We think Church ran away,
sweetheart.

406
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,018
- Yeah.
- He didn't run away.

407
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,884
Well...

408
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:24,888
He was outside my window
last night.

409
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:30,659
Honey, maybe you had a dream
that you saw him.

410
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,065
It's okay to be
confused about all this...

411
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,640
You just have to accept
that he might not come home.

412
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:44,441
I'm sorry, sweetie.

413
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,277
He came back last night.

414
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,179
Look.

415
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,547
He's right there.

416
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,237
I thought you said
he was dead.

417
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,005
He was.

418
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,640
He, uh...

419
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:20,246
He must've been unconscious,
in shock or something.

420
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,951
Good thing
you're not a fucking vet.

421
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,059
Jud.

422
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:38,130
We, uh...

423
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,732
We need to have
a little talk.

424
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,039
Ellie's cat is walking around
over there like nothing happened.

425
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,241
Well, I'll be damned.

426
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,310
What the fuck does that mean?

427
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,546
Well, isn't that
what you wanted?

428
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,183
Save your daughter
from the truth?

429
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,916
I mean, come on.
You saw as well as I did.

430
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:01,253
- That cat was dead, Jud.
- I never said he wasn't.

431
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,990
- Well, then how do you explain it?
- I don't.

432
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,659
Nobody can.

433
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,029
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Jud.

434
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:13,599
There are places in this world

435
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,869
that are older
than either of us.

436
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:20,738
<i>Places that a rational
doctor brain like yours</i>

437
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,639
<i>will never understand.</i>

438
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,608
<i>Nobody knows
what that place is,</i>

439
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,312
<i>what happens
in that stony ground.</i>

440
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:31,318
<i>But the soil of a man's heart
is stonier, Louis.</i>

441
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,090
<i>What we did last night,</i>

442
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,926
<i>we did for Ellie.</i>

443
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,730
<i>But that's your cat now.</i>

444
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:55,108
"Bull presumed
dead found on main street."

445
00:37:59,347 --> 00:38:01,247
"Timothy Baterman..."

446
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,317
"Cadaver disappearance?"

447
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,928
What the fuck?

448
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,751
Where did you take me, Jud?

449
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:51,364
Church, you're so stinky.

450
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:53,135
What'd you do out there?

451
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:58,738
Hang on, Church,
there's something...

452
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,143
Something gross in your fur.

453
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,787
All right, there we go.

454
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:14,820
Give me a look.

455
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,792
Okay. Does that feel okay?

456
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,259
Yeah?

457
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:21,697
I want to go back
to our old house.

458
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:27,267
Well, Mommy and I,
we moved up here to slow down,

459
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:31,304
so that we could spend more
time with you, so that...

460
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:32,973
Lift up.

461
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:36,810
So that Daddy could be around,
he'd get to tuck you into bed more,

462
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:39,279
make sure you're
all safe and sound.

463
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:41,815
Give you a little tickle before he says good night.

464
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:43,451
Okay? Come on.

465
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:45,353
Okay, honey.

466
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:48,321
I promise, okay, just like your
arm, it's gonna get better.

467
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:49,925
All right? Trust me?

468
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:51,758
Good night.

469
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,393
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

470
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:57,899
Close the door all the way.
I don't want Church coming in anymore.

471
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,102
Okay.

472
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:02,904
I love you.

473
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:08,075
<i>How is she?</i>

474
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:11,413
She's good.
Poor little thing.

475
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:16,118
What about Church?

476
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,090
I don't know.
Must've been the accident.

477
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:24,927
I'll take him
to the vet tomorrow.

478
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:28,298
What about you?

479
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:32,469
I'm good.

480
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,172
But...

481
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:39,542
Come here.

482
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,516
It's been hard,
the past few months.

483
00:41:17,114 --> 00:41:20,616
What? Oh, Jesus!

484
00:41:21,785 --> 00:41:22,985
Louis, it's still alive.

485
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:27,622
Damn it!

486
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:31,593
Jesus Christ.

487
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:35,966
Church?

488
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:39,136
Church?

489
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:43,972
Come out of there, buddy.

490
00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:51,014
Church...

491
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:22,779
<i>Your destruction</i>

492
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:28,486
<i>and the destruction of all
you love is very near, Doctor.</i>

493
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:38,883
Rach, what happened?
You okay?

494
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,086
Mmm.

495
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:43,256
I don't want
to talk about it.

496
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:48,529
- Is it the bird?
- No, it's not the bird.

497
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:53,133
I think it's a mistake
that we moved here.

498
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:57,337
It doesn't feel right, Louis.

499
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:04,409
You remember why we moved here
in the first place?

500
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,613
No, I know.

501
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:12,253
I mean, look, we have
Ellie's birthday coming up.

502
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:14,620
Why don't we do something
special, hey?

503
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:15,888
We could throw a party.

504
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,228
We could invite some of our
friends from Boston up, all right?

505
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,031
Invite your parents, even.

506
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,469
- Okay?
- Mmm.

507
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:33,073
We can turn this around.
We can.

508
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:35,107
We can turn this around.

509
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:48,656
Ooh,
these are looking good, El.

510
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,135
El, what is this?

511
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:07,275
I don't know.
Gage drew that.

512
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:16,585
Gage?

513
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:26,826
Come on, Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.

514
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,899
I was 11
when I lost Biff.

515
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:37,070
He'd run over some barbed wire
and the cuts got infected.

516
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:39,775
Daddy had to put him down
out of mercy.

517
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:45,679
- Your dad took you up there.
- No, no.

518
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:49,016
It was an old fella
named Stanny Bouchard.

519
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:50,486
He told me about it.

520
00:46:54,257 --> 00:46:56,259
The Wendigo.

521
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:58,825
You heard a lot about that

522
00:46:58,827 --> 00:47:01,596
all over the north country
back in the old days.

523
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:04,197
It was a myth

524
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,334
passed down from the local
tribes up this way.

525
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:11,605
But to them, it wasn't
just some campfire story.

526
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:13,943
They believed it.
They feared it.

527
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,845
Saw these
on the trees up there.

528
00:47:17,847 --> 00:47:19,747
Yeah, they're warnings.

529
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:22,584
The local tribes carved them
before they fled.

530
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:23,784
Fled?

531
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:26,687
Yeah, they knew
the power of that place.

532
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:30,124
They felt its pull.

533
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:35,796
They came to believe that
those woods belonged to something else.

534
00:47:35,798 --> 00:47:38,601
That the ground was bad.

535
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,705
Sour.

536
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:44,273
The ground is sour.

537
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:47,241
Yeah.

538
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:50,947
So, they moved on.
But not before they built that deadfall.

539
00:47:52,415 --> 00:47:54,348
They built it
to keep people out.

540
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,886
But it didn't keep people out.

541
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:59,054
The Wendigo

542
00:47:59,056 --> 00:48:02,758
may just be
some crazy folktale,

543
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,828
but there is
something up there.

544
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:08,799
Something
that brings things back.

545
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,003
So, what happened
to your dog, Jud?

546
00:48:13,937 --> 00:48:16,505
He came back.

547
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:21,143
Just like Stanny B. said he would.
But he was changed.

548
00:48:21,145 --> 00:48:24,815
It was when he went after my
mother that my daddy put him down.

549
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:27,384
For the second time.

550
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:36,290
I thought it would be
different with Ellie's cat.

551
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:40,295
I mean, Biff had a mean
streak to begin with.

552
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:43,298
But Church, well...

553
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,602
- Was a nice cat...
- He tried to hurt Gage.

554
00:48:47,437 --> 00:48:49,841
I'm so sorry, Louis. I am.

555
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:55,578
Once you feel the power
of that place,

556
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,083
you make up the sweetest-smelling
reasons to go back.

557
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:02,786
But I was wrong.

558
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:06,958
Sometimes dead is better.

559
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:14,365
Come on, hold still.

560
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,533
Hold still, you're just
gonna go to sleep.

561
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:20,072
- -Damn it, Church.
Come on, just...

562
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:26,778
God damn it.

563
00:49:41,694 --> 00:49:42,728
Come on.

564
00:49:43,562 --> 00:49:44,428
Hey.

565
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:50,366
Good luck.

566
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:18,095
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

567
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:21,665

570
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:36,914
Good job, Ellie.

571
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,549
I want a piece
right from the end.

572
00:50:41,921 --> 00:50:43,555
...big St. Bernard.

573
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:46,893
He got rabies.
He killed about four people.

574
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,734
Hey.

575
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:01,107
You still thinking
about Church?

576
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,541
It's my fault he left.

577
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:06,510
I told him
to get out of my room.

578
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:08,445
No, honey, no.

579
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:09,950
Church loves you.

580
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:14,821
Maybe this might
help cheer you up.

581
00:51:20,428 --> 00:51:21,893
Give him a squeeze.

582
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:22,961
Hmm?

583
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:27,131
- I love him, Daddy.
- You do? Yeah?

584
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:28,400
And I love you.

585
00:51:28,402 --> 00:51:31,972
Now go and have
a great birthday, okay?

586
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,839
<i>Six...</i>

587
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:40,846
Seven, eight, nine, 10!

588
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:45,785
I'm a monster!

589
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,322
Where is everyone?
Where are you guys? Come on.

590
00:51:55,796 --> 00:51:58,766
Come on! Where is that...
Come on! Come on!

591
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:13,680
Church?

592
00:52:15,316 --> 00:52:16,717
Church!

593
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:26,094
Church. You came home.

594
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:38,639
All right, you're it.

595
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,677
Where's...

596
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:45,914
Gage!

597
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,590
Church!

598
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:18,194
I keep thinking

599
00:56:18,196 --> 00:56:22,532
that I'm gonna hear her
coming up the stairs,

600
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:25,337
like she's coming home
from school.

601
00:56:33,945 --> 00:56:36,247
I can't be here right now.

602
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:46,891
I'm just gonna
wrap up a few things.

603
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,293
Come soon.

604
00:56:49,295 --> 00:56:51,864
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

605
00:56:55,234 --> 00:56:58,034
Be a good boy, okay, buddy?
Take care of Mommy for me.

606
00:56:58,036 --> 00:56:59,505
I'll see you in a couple days.

607
00:57:57,997 --> 00:58:01,334
I saw Rachel and Gage
leaving a little while ago.

608
00:58:02,536 --> 00:58:03,769
Boston.

609
00:58:05,473 --> 00:58:07,073
Parents' house.

610
00:58:11,544 --> 00:58:13,413
So it's just you over there?

611
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:16,749
Yep.

612
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:18,116
I'll drive down
in a few days.

613
00:58:18,118 --> 00:58:21,154
I got to finish a few things
at the clinic first.

614
00:58:23,657 --> 00:58:25,290
That's good.

615
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:28,229
It's a tough time
for you folks to be apart.

616
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,165
Yeah.

617
00:58:55,891 --> 00:59:01,162
You know, when you came walking over
here, it was a relief.

618
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:04,565
I was gonna come to see you.

619
00:59:07,535 --> 00:59:10,605
I should never have
shown you that place.

620
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,141
But you did.

621
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:18,478
I know what you're
thinking of doing, Louis...

622
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,848
...but she
won't come back the same.

623
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,985
I'm so goddamn sorry
I did this.

624
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:31,925
Ellie is the first person to
touch my heart in a long time.

625
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:35,261
I didn't want her
to be so sad.

626
00:59:35,263 --> 00:59:38,965
It's that goddamn place.
It feeds on your grief,

627
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:41,369
gets into your mind.

628
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:44,272
Damn it.

629
00:59:46,474 --> 00:59:50,077
I need to
close my eyes for a minute.

630
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:10,398
<i>Hey.</i>

631
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:12,565
<i>Thought you'd be in bed.</i>

632
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:16,438
I was waiting to hear from you.
I called earlier.

633
01:00:17,606 --> 01:00:19,673
<i>Yeah, I know, I saw that.
I was, uh...</i>

634
01:00:19,675 --> 01:00:23,479
I went over to Jud's.
Had a couple of drinks.

635
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:28,083
<i>Can you just
come be with us?</i>

636
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:33,755
Gage needs you and I'm...

637
01:00:39,027 --> 01:00:41,397
I'm really wiped out, honey.

638
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,268
Is it okay
if we talk tomorrow?

639
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,404
Okay.

640
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:51,539
I love you.

641
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,276
I love you, too.

642
01:00:53,744 --> 01:00:55,044
Goodbye.

643
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:20,336
Fuck.

644
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,918
<i>Louis, stop.</i>

645
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,588
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

646
01:03:17,856 --> 01:03:20,090
<i>You have to let her go.</i>

647
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:21,659
But I can fix this.

648
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:24,326
<i>Pascow!</i>

649
01:03:24,328 --> 01:03:27,465
Pascow! Pascow!

650
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,935
Come here. No, it's okay.

651
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:34,339
It's okay. It's okay.

652
01:03:36,141 --> 01:03:37,874
<i>Go home.</i>

653
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:40,144
Pascow says go home.

654
01:03:40,146 --> 01:03:42,247
Mommy, go home!

655
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:45,716
There's nothing there.

656
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:57,930
There's nothing there.

657
01:04:15,748 --> 01:04:18,816
Daddy's almost there,
almost there.

658
01:05:22,249 --> 01:05:23,917
I'm sorry.

659
01:09:47,318 --> 01:09:49,153
Daddy?

660
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,221
Where am I?

661
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:56,761
Oh, my... My little girl.

662
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:00,397
Come here.

663
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:01,965
Oh, you're home!

664
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:07,606
Home.

665
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:07,666
What is it?

666
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:09,969
Just a tangle.

667
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,419
Where's Mommy and Gage?

668
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:30,924
They went down
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

669
01:11:31,658 --> 01:11:33,960
Are they coming back?

670
01:11:37,197 --> 01:11:38,198
Yeah.

671
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:44,836
I remember my birthday party.

672
01:11:46,772 --> 01:11:48,741
Church was out on the road.

673
01:11:51,511 --> 01:11:54,047
I was so happy he came home.

674
01:11:57,884 --> 01:11:59,819
There was a truck.

675
01:12:00,787 --> 01:12:02,722
Then everything went black.

676
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:05,326
Well, it's okay now.

677
01:12:07,194 --> 01:12:08,728
Now you're back.

678
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:13,199
Back from where?

679
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:24,343
It's time to go to bed, okay?
Turn the light off.

680
01:12:24,345 --> 01:12:26,914
I'm dead, aren't I?

681
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:29,351
No, honey. No.

682
01:12:31,151 --> 01:12:32,419
You're here.

683
01:12:34,754 --> 01:12:36,756
Will you stay with me?

684
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:39,426
Of course.

685
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:57,111
I can hear the woods.

686
01:12:59,313 --> 01:13:01,915
The windows are
closed, sweetheart.

687
01:13:02,383 --> 01:13:04,051
Not like that.

688
01:13:06,321 --> 01:13:08,089
Inside.

689
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:17,330
Does Mommy know about me?

690
01:13:17,332 --> 01:13:18,933
Please, El...

691
01:13:20,402 --> 01:13:22,870
Close your eyes, okay?

692
01:13:23,804 --> 01:13:25,873
It's gonna be okay.

693
01:13:33,815 --> 01:13:35,551
Love you, Daddy.

694
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,422
Love you too, El.

695
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,887
El?

696
01:14:47,657 --> 01:14:49,125
Ellie, careful.

697
01:14:52,262 --> 01:14:55,265
Just stop it. Stop it.
Stop. Ellie, stop it.

698
01:14:56,198 --> 01:14:57,633
Stop it!

699
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:09,212
Why'd you put
the dress back on?

700
01:15:19,089 --> 01:15:20,921
What are you gonna tell her?

701
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:31,366
Something happened
last night. I...

702
01:15:31,368 --> 01:15:33,769
Gage was having a nightmare,
or I thought it was a nightmare,

703
01:15:33,771 --> 01:15:36,539
and he just started saying
that boy's name who died.

704
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:38,973
I'm freaking out,
and Gage is freaking out,

705
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:40,543
and I... I just need
to talk to you.

706
01:15:40,545 --> 01:15:43,245
Just please call me back.

707
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:44,612
<i>It's 4:00 p.m. on the dot</i>

708
01:15:44,614 --> 01:15:46,916
<i>and we're coming
to you with a traffic update.</i>

709
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,216
<i>Expect major delays.</i>

710
01:15:48,218 --> 01:15:50,151
<i>Traffic on the I-95
is backed-up for miles.</i>

711
01:15:50,153 --> 01:15:52,487
We're gonna be okay, okay?

712
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:54,122
- Okay?
- Mama.

713
01:15:54,124 --> 01:15:56,492
- Mama.
- <i>Call Jud.</i>

714
01:15:56,494 --> 01:16:01,497
<i>So far, no fatalities,
but two passengers have been airlifted...</i>

715
01:16:01,499 --> 01:16:03,766
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Jud, hi, it's Rachel.

716
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,001
Rachel. You...

717
01:16:06,003 --> 01:16:08,570
You down at your folks' place?

718
01:16:08,572 --> 01:16:10,472
<i>Yeah, I'm on my way back.
Something's wrong.</i>

719
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:12,273
<i>I'm really worried about
Louis right now.</i>

720
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:14,142
- Louis?
- Can you just go over there

721
01:16:14,144 --> 01:16:15,845
and check on him, please?

722
01:16:15,847 --> 01:16:18,481
<i>I just... I've been calling him
all morning, and I don't know...</i>

723
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:22,485
What...
He... He's not answering?

724
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:25,755
No. And I've called him
so many times.

725
01:16:25,757 --> 01:16:29,759
- <i>Well, I'll go on over there and check.</i>
- Okay. Thank you, Jud.

726
01:16:29,761 --> 01:16:31,328
<i>I should be there soon, okay?</i>

727
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,196
Yeah,
I'll see you then, Rachel.

728
01:16:43,174 --> 01:16:46,143
Louis? You in there?

729
01:16:50,349 --> 01:16:51,483
Hey, Jud.

730
01:16:53,017 --> 01:16:54,684
How's your head today?

731
01:16:54,686 --> 01:16:56,452
Oh.

732
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:58,389
It's banging
like a drum, Jud.

733
01:17:07,232 --> 01:17:09,633
I don't remember
you leaving last night.

734
01:17:09,635 --> 01:17:11,236
Yeah, you passed out.

735
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:15,472
Listen,
I got to, uh...

736
01:17:15,474 --> 01:17:17,276
I got to get
back inside. I'm...

737
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:21,011
I've been waiting for Rachel
to call all morning

738
01:17:21,013 --> 01:17:23,382
and I don't want
to miss it. So...

739
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,050
Okay?

740
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:32,124
If you've done
something, Louis,

741
01:17:33,325 --> 01:17:35,327
it's not too late
to undo it.

742
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,169
You don't have to worry
about me, Jud.

743
01:17:44,803 --> 01:17:46,138
I'm fine.

744
01:17:47,806 --> 01:17:49,072
Really.

745
01:17:49,074 --> 01:17:50,743
If that's all, I'm gonna...

746
01:17:51,711 --> 01:17:53,178
I'm gonna go.

747
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:41,923
I know you're up here!

748
01:21:25,661 --> 01:21:27,995
- Hello, Jud.
- Stop it, Ellie.

749
01:21:27,997 --> 01:21:30,066
Now, just slow down.

750
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,467
Your sweet Norma.

751
01:21:33,469 --> 01:21:36,403
She's burning down in hell
for what you did to her.

752
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:38,940
I saw her there, Jud.
I saw her.

753
01:21:38,942 --> 01:21:41,578
Shut up! You don't know
anything about her!

754
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,914
Did you miss me, Judson?

755
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:48,950
That's not my Norma!

756
01:21:51,188 --> 01:21:55,123
Ellie's hurting.
You did this to her!

757
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:57,258
It's not you.
It's not you!

758
01:21:57,260 --> 01:22:00,094
You told Louis
about that place.

759
01:22:00,096 --> 01:22:02,030
And now we're suffering

760
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:03,900
eternally.

761
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:11,371
But we're here now
to bring you back

762
01:22:11,373 --> 01:22:14,075
so you can suffer with us.

763
01:22:14,077 --> 01:22:16,780
Just you come
and fucking try!

764
01:22:24,989 --> 01:22:26,123
El?

765
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,667
Oh, shit.

766
01:22:41,371 --> 01:22:43,138
Rachel.

767
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,672
What are you...

768
01:22:44,674 --> 01:22:46,775
You're okay.
Thank God you're okay!

769
01:22:46,777 --> 01:22:49,078
I was so worried,
and I was calling

770
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,279
and you wouldn't
pick up, and

771
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:51,580
Gage was having
these nightmares

772
01:22:51,582 --> 01:22:55,049
and he was saying the name
of that boy that died.

773
01:22:55,051 --> 01:22:58,153
I'm here right now.
I just need you and no one else.

774
01:22:58,155 --> 01:22:59,420
Just you, me and Gage,

775
01:22:59,422 --> 01:23:01,656
- we can get through this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

776
01:23:01,658 --> 01:23:03,325
Come on, honey, it's okay.

777
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:04,593
Oh. Oh.

778
01:23:04,595 --> 01:23:06,695
- Look at you, hey? You're Daddy's boy.
- Daddy.

779
01:23:06,697 --> 01:23:08,664
Have you gotten bigger?
Hey? Tell me, come on.

780
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:10,666
Have you gotten bigger?
I think he has. I think he has.

781
01:23:10,668 --> 01:23:12,568
I think he's gotten
a lot bigger.

782
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:14,503
Oh, you smell so good! Hmm.

783
01:23:14,505 --> 01:23:17,040
Oh, you smell so good!
Come to Daddy.

784
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:20,845
Louis, what's going on?

785
01:23:25,049 --> 01:23:27,418
I needed more time with her.

786
01:23:28,052 --> 01:23:30,588
Come here. Come here.

787
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:33,025
Honey.

788
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:36,762
I wasn't ready
to say goodbye to her.

789
01:23:37,296 --> 01:23:39,596
You're scaring me.

790
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:41,731
Just tell me
what you're talking about.

791
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:43,532
It was my fault
she died, Rach.

792
01:23:43,534 --> 01:23:45,469
I had to bring her back.

793
01:23:49,975 --> 01:23:51,308
Ellie-phant.

794
01:24:00,686 --> 01:24:02,788
The Great and Terrible.

795
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:09,227
There's a place, Rach,
deep in the woods

796
01:24:10,262 --> 01:24:12,563
beyond the pet cemetery.

797
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:18,971
It brings things back.

798
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,840
Aren't you happy, Mommy?

799
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:38,124
Hug your daughter, Rach.

800
01:24:39,425 --> 01:24:41,027
Hug your daughter.

801
01:24:50,103 --> 01:24:52,605
I need to put Gage to bed.

802
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:56,008
Rachel!

803
01:24:57,076 --> 01:24:58,309
She doesn't want me here.

804
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:02,079
No, no, no, no, no.
Mommy just needs time.

805
01:25:02,081 --> 01:25:06,083
It's okay.
I don't want her here, either.

806
01:25:06,085 --> 01:25:08,420
We're okay. Okay, yes.

807
01:25:08,422 --> 01:25:10,422
Here you go.
Here you go, sweetie.

808
01:25:10,424 --> 01:25:12,023
Rachel.

809
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:13,960
Rachel, open up. Please.

810
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,130
Just let me explain.

811
01:25:17,398 --> 01:25:19,866
I know. Let me explain.

812
01:25:24,971 --> 01:25:27,605
What is she? What is...

813
01:25:27,607 --> 01:25:29,073
That is Ellie out there.

814
01:25:29,075 --> 01:25:32,743
No. No, we buried her.
We put her in the ground.

815
01:25:32,745 --> 01:25:36,448
She's been given back to us.
We have a second chance.

816
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:38,483
It doesn't work
that way, Louis.

817
01:25:38,485 --> 01:25:39,985
Yes, it does.
There's a place in the woods.

818
01:25:39,987 --> 01:25:41,353
That place
I was telling you about.

819
01:25:41,355 --> 01:25:43,754
I couldn't understand it until
I buried Church up there.

820
01:25:43,756 --> 01:25:46,057
That cat was dead until I
buried him in the ground

821
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:47,560
and it brought him back.

822
01:25:48,961 --> 01:25:51,597
He wasn't the same
after that.

823
01:25:52,433 --> 01:25:54,399
You saw her.

824
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,435
You touched her.
That is our daughter.

825
01:25:56,437 --> 01:25:57,936
You dug her up?

826
01:25:57,938 --> 01:25:59,971
That is our daughter
down there, honey.

827
01:25:59,973 --> 01:26:01,575
Please, okay?

828
01:26:03,278 --> 01:26:04,743
I did what I think
was right.

829
01:26:04,745 --> 01:26:07,747
Let God take
his own fucking kid!

830
01:26:20,828 --> 01:26:22,830
- Ellie?
- You're okay.

831
01:26:23,864 --> 01:26:24,931
Ellie!

832
01:26:24,933 --> 01:26:28,369
Ellie, baby, Mommy and Daddy
were just...

833
01:26:31,338 --> 01:26:32,606
Shit.

834
01:26:43,585 --> 01:26:45,351
Mama.

835
01:26:45,353 --> 01:26:47,854
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

836
01:26:47,856 --> 01:26:50,123
Mommy's okay. Mommy's...

837
01:26:57,432 --> 01:27:00,801
No. No, no, no.
No, no, no...

838
01:27:02,504 --> 01:27:03,705
No.

839
01:28:09,972 --> 01:28:11,073
Rachel.

840
01:28:15,911 --> 01:28:19,416
Now you'll never
get out of bed again.

841
01:28:32,596 --> 01:28:34,562
No! No!

842
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:37,398
Stop struggling,
you useless cow.

843
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:39,768
Ellie?

844
01:28:46,443 --> 01:28:47,477
Shit.

845
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,375
Jud!

846
01:29:24,682 --> 01:29:26,314
Oh, my God.

847
01:29:26,316 --> 01:29:29,119
Oh, my God. No, Jud.

848
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:36,827
God damn it!

849
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,425
Louis! Take the baby!

850
01:30:09,427 --> 01:30:11,293
- Louis!
- Rachel!

851
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:13,262
Take the baby!
Ellie's trying to kill me!

852
01:30:13,264 --> 01:30:14,830
- Come on, I got him. Jump!
- Take the baby!

853
01:30:14,832 --> 01:30:17,634
Let him go! Come on,
Daddy's got you.

854
01:30:17,636 --> 01:30:18,969
Come on.

855
01:30:25,644 --> 01:30:27,744
Okay. Okay, Gage.

856
01:30:27,746 --> 01:30:29,612
Daddy needs you
to stay in the car, okay?

857
01:30:29,614 --> 01:30:30,946
Don't open the door
for anyone.

858
01:30:30,948 --> 01:30:32,682
Listen to me, Gage,
not even for Ellie.

859
01:30:36,455 --> 01:30:40,089
You let me die in that road.
You did nothing.

860
01:30:40,091 --> 01:30:42,327
Just like you did
with your sister.

861
01:30:43,795 --> 01:30:45,364
I was scared.

862
01:30:56,308 --> 01:30:58,341
You're a liar.

863
01:30:58,343 --> 01:31:00,612
You prayed
your sister would die.

864
01:31:01,546 --> 01:31:02,981
I did.

865
01:31:04,683 --> 01:31:08,652
Remember when Daddy said
there was nothing after this?

866
01:31:08,654 --> 01:31:10,322
Well, he was wrong.

867
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,990
But it's not heaven.

868
01:31:13,992 --> 01:31:16,928
And you're going there soon,
Mommy.

869
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:21,133
Don't call me "Mommy."

870
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:26,972
You're not my daughter.

871
01:31:29,876 --> 01:31:31,377
Ellie's dead.

872
01:31:32,512 --> 01:31:34,345
Then go be with her!

873
01:31:36,582 --> 01:31:38,117
Rachel!

874
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,489
Oh, God, Rach.
I got Gage.

875
01:31:45,491 --> 01:31:48,325
Don't bury me in that place.

876
01:31:48,327 --> 01:31:49,328
What?

877
01:32:44,618 --> 01:32:46,520
Oh, fuck. Shit.

878
01:33:02,302 --> 01:33:03,604
Rachel!

879
01:33:05,572 --> 01:33:07,441
You're too late.

880
01:33:10,645 --> 01:33:12,378
Where's Mommy?

881
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:15,550
Mommy's already
feasting on dirt.

882
01:33:16,384 --> 01:33:19,319
What have you done, El?
Come on.

883
01:33:21,188 --> 01:33:23,490
You started this, Daddy.

884
01:33:25,526 --> 01:33:27,529
When you moved us here.

885
01:33:29,831 --> 01:33:32,030
When you buried Church.

886
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:34,032

01:33:51,619 --> 01:33:53,319
Stop fighting, Daddy.

888
01:33:53,321 --> 01:33:55,256
It will be better this way.

889
01:34:16,578 --> 01:34:19,615
You're dead!
You're dead!

890
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:30,458
You're dead!

891
01:34:32,193 --> 01:34:34,195
Please,
please, just stop.

01:34:40,035 --> 01:34:41,902
Get off!
