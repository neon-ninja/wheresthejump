Sunday, September 5th

13
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,360
A grade-school boy was on holiday down in Izu with his family.

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,640
He wanted to go out and play...

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,660
...but there was a TV show he didn't want to miss.

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,240
So he recorded it on the VCR in their room.

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
But the channels down there are different from Tokyo's.

18
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,920
No station there uses that channel, so it should have been blank.

19
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,310
But when he played it back at home, there was a woman on the screen.

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,530
You will die in one week, she said.

21
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,970
The kid stopped the tape, and then the phone rang.

22
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,670
``You saw it.''

23
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,500
And a week later, the kid died!

24
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
What's wrong, Tomoko?

25
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,360
Who told you that?

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,930
Everybody's talking about it.

27
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,360
Yoko?

28
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,570
No, not her.

29
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,750
What?

30
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,970
I saw a weird video the other day.

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,900
Where?

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,700
With Yoko and the rest.

33
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,820
Did all of you really go and spend the night somewhere?

34
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,930
Nothing happened!

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,060
But that night...

36
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,130
...Iwata found this weird video, and we all watched it.

37
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,250
How was it ``weird''?

38
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,600
It's hard to say.

39
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,210
Just after it ended, someone phoned us.

40
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,460
It was some kind of prank call.

41
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,010
Yuck.

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,330
Everyone else had heard that story.

43
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,730
Today it'll be one week.

44
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,880
Come on!

45
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,430
You're just trying to scare me!

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,020
I had you going!

47
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,900
I don't believe you.

48
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,460
You're so easy to fool.

49
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,120
But did you really spend the night there?

50
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,820
So what happened?

51
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm not telling!

52
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,500
Confess!

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,210
It's a secret.

54
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,580
Is it true?

55
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,570
Masami!

56
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,080
Masami!

57
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,520
Hello?

58
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,260
She's right here.

59
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,630
Hello?

60
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,550
Oh... Mom!

61
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,800
A friend came over.

62
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,060
OK.

63
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,720
Got it.

64
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,320
Yeah, yeah...

65
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,450
Extra innings.  They'll be late.

66
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,390
Don't scare me like that.

67
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,350
Look who's talking.  I'm going to tell everyone tomorrow.

68
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,330
I'm going to the toilet.  Don't go upstairs without me.

69
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,460
Sure.

70
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,160
There's this ``video curse'' everyone's talking about...

71
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,150
Yes.

72
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,570
Have you heard what kind of video it is?

73
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,030
Yes.

74
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,890
Don't look at the camera.

75
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,700
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,300
Again.

77
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,930
Have you heard what kind of video it is?

78
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,180
I heard that suddenly there's this scary woman...

79
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,260
...who says ``you will die in one week''.

80
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,140
They say if you watch late-night TV, she appears.

81
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,970
And then the phone rings.

82
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,930
Late-night TV?  What channel?

83
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,160
I heard it was on a local channel down in Izu.

84
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,940
Izu?

85
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,400
Yeah.

86
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,390
And is there really someone who died a week later?

87
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,190
No one that we know.

88
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,120
What?

89
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,920
A high school student I know told me...

90
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,280
...a girl who'd seen it died on a date with her boyfriend.

91
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,130
An accident?

92
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,210
No.  They were found dead in a parked car.

93
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,200
He'd seen the video, too.

94
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,630
It was in the paper two or three days ago.

95
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,520
Do you know what school?

96
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,710
No.  My friend heard it from a friend of hers.

97
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,110
Ms. Asakawa...

98
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,460
Yes?

99
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,170
Here.

100
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,230
Thanks.

101
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,810
About ten years ago...

102
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,510
...a pop idol killed herself, and people saw her ghost on TV.

103
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,610
Yeah, but everyone you ask about this one...

104
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,680
...talks about the Izu Peninsula.

105
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,110
Well, maybe that's where this one started.

106
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,090
Where did they see the woman whose lips went up to her ears?

107
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,800
Further west, in Gifu.

108
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,720
That was after a big traffic accident down there.

109
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,030
A big accident?

110
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,040
These stories get started when people die horrible deaths.

111
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,750
So what happened in Izu?

112
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,650
I don't know.

113
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,070
Anyway, I'm going.

114
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,820
Good night.

115
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,820
Good night.

116
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,500
Young Couple Found Dead in Car

117
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,060
A 19-year-old Tokyo boy and a 17-year-old Yokohama girl...

118
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,640
...were found dead in a car on the morning of Sept. 6...

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
Take care of it, will you?

120
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,970
Weren't you leaving early today?

121
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,620
Okazaki, will you do something for me?

122
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,430
Can you find this high school for me?

123
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:00,880
Sure.

124
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,690
Call me when you find it.

125
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,150
Yoichi!

126
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,490
You're changed already!

127
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,090
I put your clothes out, too.

128
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,540
We need to hurry.

129
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,700
Did Grandpa call?

130
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,550
No.

131
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,160
Why did Tomo-chan die?

132
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,650
Some strange disease, I guess.

133
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,540
Zip me up.

134
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,480
Do kids die, too?

135
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,570
Sometimes they get sick.

136
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,560
But don't talk about that at Aunt Yoshiki's, okay?  It's too hard for her.

137
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,430
Yeah.

138
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,620
Tomoko played with you, didn't she?

139
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,970
Dad...

140
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,720
How's Big Sister?

141
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,200
She's lying down.  Better leave her alone.

142
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,950
I'll go help.

143
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,500
Yoichi, you come sit here.

144
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,760
Reiko-chan.

145
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,550
Does anyone know why Tomoko died?

146
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,580
No, not me.

147
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,910
But the police did an autopsy!

148
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,560
But there was no evidence of a crime.

149
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,870
People don't just die like that.

150
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,140
And it's a closed coffin. Isn't that strange?

151
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,140
Yoichi...

152
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,580
You shouldn't just come in here.

153
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,850
Go downstairs.

154
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,520
Okay.

155
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,810
Go on.

156
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,570
Okay.

157
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,810
Hello?

158
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,210
It's Okazaki.

159
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,760
I found the name of the high school.

160
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,700
Seikei Academy in Yokohama.

161
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,160
Thank you.

162
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:57,180
In Loving Memory Seikei Academy

163
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,250
Excuse me...

164
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,570
Was the girl who died in the car a friend of yours, too?

165
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,760
If there's anything you know...

166
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,930
They all died the same day.

167
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,330
Yoko and Tomoko.  And Iwata, too, on his motorbike.

168
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,920
They saw the video...

169
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,370
The video?

170
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,370
Yoko told us they'd all seen this weird video...

171
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,510
When it was over, they got a phone call...

172
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,700
Tomoko saw it, too?  Where?

173
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,550
They all went and stayed over somewhere...

174
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,930
The girl who was with Tomoko when she died...

175
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,550
She went crazy.  She's in the hospital.

176
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,250
She won't go anywhere there's a TV...

177
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,580
The girl was named Tsuji Yoko.  17, in her third year at Seikei Academy.

178
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,580
The boy was Nomi Tadahiko, 19, doing a college prep year.

179
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,660
The car doors were locked.

180
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,200
I've never seen a corpse that looked like that.

181
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,760
Cause of death?

182
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,720
Unknown.  Their hearts simply stopped.

183
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,990
Drugs?

184
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,700
Nothing in the autopsy.

185
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,020
They'd just started making out, then they just died.

186
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,700
It doesn't make sense.

187
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,410
Yo-chan was at the funeral.

188
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,070
Yes.

189
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,050
He used to go upstairs and play in her room...

190
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,340
He did, didn't he?

191
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,700
The Photo Shop

192
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,180
I found Tomoko dead here.

193
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,190
Tomoko!

194
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,780
Izu...

195
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,630
I might be late tonight.

196
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,890
Put your supper in the microwave.  Got it?

197
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,110
OK... Mom...

198
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,990
Yeah?

199
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,780
Tomoko saw the cursed video.

200
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,670
Why did you say that?

201
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,370
Don't say anything about that at school, you hear?

202
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,250
I won't.  I'm off.

203
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,650
Monday, September 13th

204
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,620
Izu Parkway

205
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,110
This is crazy!

206
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,740
Izu Pacific Land

207
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:08,720
``My dad's fat.  My mom's fat.  So I'm fat, too.''

208
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,720
You're here alone?

209
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,180
Yeah, I'm doing a bit of work.

210
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,620
Umm...

211
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,190
These four people stayed here on August 29th.

212
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,790
Did you notice anything unusual?

213
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,170
Just a minute, okay?  August 29th...

214
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,020
That tape...

215
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,410
That one.

216
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,700
What is it?

217
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,230
This one?

218
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,930
Someone must have left it.

219
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,520
ERUPTION

220
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,830
Sada

221
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,950
One week!

222
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,070
Tuesday, September 14th

223
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,740
So Yoichi's in school?

224
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,250
First grade.

225
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,800
So how are you, Ryuji?

226
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,070
Same as always.

227
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,060
What are you doing?

228
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,050
Teaching at a university.

229
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,860
So then there was a phone call?

230
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,120
Yes.

231
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,010
So this phone will ring after I see it?

232
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,850
Four people died, all on the same day!

233
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Go to a shrine and get exorcised.

234
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,810
Take my picture.

235
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,820
Face this way.

236
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,510
Hurry up and take it!

237
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,100
It's over.

238
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,900
No phone call.

239
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,820
Copy this for me.  I'll take a good look at it.

240
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,540
It's not certain death yet.

241
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,160
It's a video.  Someone made it.

242
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,700
I'll check who stayed there.  Also for pirate broadcasts.

243
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,970
Wednesday, September 15th

244
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,100
From the Izu bureau.

245
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,210
Thanks!

246
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,550
Why do you want that list of customers?

247
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,180
Sorry...

248
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,370
I just need to check something by myself.

249
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,130
Was it you?

250
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,560
Did you do this?

251
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,650
Sorry I'm late.

252
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,560
What's wrong?

253
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,810
Nothing.

254
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,610
Well?

255
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,240
No one I phoned took a tape to the cabin.

256
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,430
And they all sounded normal, not like they'd make a tape like this.

257
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,560
Pirate stations?

258
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,370
There's no record of an illegal broadcast anywhere in Izu.

259
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,510
Here's the copy.

260
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,120
Asakawa...

261
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,830
Have you ever seen this woman?

262
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,340
No.

263
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,910
This shot is weird.

264
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,090
From that angle, the cameraman should appear in the mirror.

265
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,120
What do you mean?

266
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,250
Well, you could fix it with special effects, but...

267
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,760
``Eruption''...

268
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,890
Which eruption?

269
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,810
You can't read it on a regular home TV...

270
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,950
Come in.

271
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,740
Takano... A student of mine.

272
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,050
Asakawa.  My ex-wife.

273
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,300
How do you do?  I'm Takano.

274
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,260
I'm Asakawa.

275
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,230
Sensei, the publisher wants your essay.

276
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,440
Why did they tell you that?

277
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,850
They couldn't find you.

278
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,150
Ask them to extend the deadline a week.

279
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,160
Me?  Ask them yourself!

280
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,190
Okay, okay...

281
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,760
No good...

282
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,710
``Sa...da...''

283
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,380
Is Yoichi all right alone?

284
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,610
He's used to it.

285
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,940
Whoever did this left a sign subconsciously.

286
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,540
He wants to be stopped.

287
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,000
Wait.

288
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,000
``Frolic in brine, goblins be thine.''

289
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,160
It sounds like some sort of dialect.

290
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,440
What does it mean?

291
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,940
I'll check tomorrow.

292
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,710
...who says ``you will die in one week''.

293
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,450
They say if you watch late night TV, she appears.

294
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,460
And then the phone rings.

295
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,280
Thursday, September 16th

296
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,610
I heard it was on a local channel down in Izu.

297
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,030
Hello?

298
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,550
I found it.  As I thought, it is a dialect.

299
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,130
It's something about ``brine'' and ``goblins''.

300
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,540
A dialect from where?

301
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,170
Oshima Island.  The volcano there.

302
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,750
Hello, Yoichi?

303
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,230
I'll be late tonight.

304
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,760
Yeah.

305
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,250
You're okay alone?

306
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,680
I'm sorry.

307
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,640
Mt. Miharayama Erupts

308
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,640
Here... but it's a long time ago.

309
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,820
Did Local Woman Predict Eruption?

310
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,790
What is it?

311
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,490
Do you have an Oshima Bureau?

312
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,480
I think so.  A correspondent.

313
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,860
Get me the number. Tonight.

314
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,290
Why?

315
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,930
You only have four days left.

316
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,450
I'll handle it with your correspondent.

317
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,900
You stay with Yoichi.

318
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,020
Grandpa!

319
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,800
Well, hello...

320
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,250
Friday, September 17th

321
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,090
Yoichi wants to go fishing with his Grandpa.

322
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,760
Oh, is that so?

323
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,420
C'mon, let's go!

324
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,260
Let's go out and go fishing!

325
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,020
Yeah!

326
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,560
Grandpa!  You've got one!

327
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,410
Aww, he got away!

328
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,730
You're not very good at this!

329
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,210
Okay, let's try it again.

330
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,540
Let's fish over here this time.

331
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,500
All right.

332
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,970
You're home...

333
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,250
Hello?

334
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,360
Your man on Oshima says...

335
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,740
...our woman is probably the one who predicted the eruption.

336
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,600
Her name was Yamamura Shizuko.

337
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,380
She threw herself into the volcano 40 years ago.

338
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,240
What do we do now?

339
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,600
Go down there, I guess.

340
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,110
I'll go tomorrow.

341
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,120
Oshima?  But I only have three days left!

342
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,800
I know.  I have four.

343
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,760
I'll call again.

344
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,120
Is something wrong?

345
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,450
No, just some work.

346
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,230
Auntie...

347
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,730
Yoichi?

348
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,350
Yoichi!  Did you bring that?!

349
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,920
You did, didn't you?  Why?!

350
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,360
Tomo-chan...

351
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,750
Tomo-chan told me to.

352
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,100
I was careless.

353
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,480
I sensed something at your place.

354
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,430
I thought it was the video.

355
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,150
It was Tomo-chan.

356
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,310
She's not Tomoko anymore.

357
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,030
Yoichi can see her, too, then.

358
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,010
It's all my fault, isn't it?

359
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:11,320
It should have ended with Tomoko and the others.

360
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,790
I wonder...

361
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,930
Who did the story start with?

362
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,630
Stories like that don't start with anyone.

363
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,340
People feel anxious, and rumors start flying.

364
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,920
Anxious?

365
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,360
Or people start them, hoping things will turn out like this.

366
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,210
Mr. Hayatsu?

367
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,910
Hello.  Sorry you've had to come all the way out here.

368
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,950
This way.

369
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,440
Saturday, September 18th

370
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,540
The Yamamuras...

371
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,520
...used to run big fishing crews here.

372
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,340
They're all but out of the business now.

373
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,610
Shizuko's cousin is still alive.

374
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,640
His son and daughter-in-law run an inn.

375
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:32,000
I've booked you into there for the night.

376
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,950
Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit suicide?

377
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,390
They say she went crazy.

378
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:54,740
The papers had written some things about her.

379
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,180
She was famous all over the island after she predicted the eruption.

380
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,350
It had always been said that she had strange powers.

381
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,940
She was what they call a seer.

382
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,250
After that, a professor showed up.

383
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,310
You've heard of him.  Ikuma Heihachiro.

384
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,380
Wasn't he fired?

385
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,950
He brought Shizuko to Tokyo and experimented on her.

386
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,190
He was trying to prove the existence of ESP.

387
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,480
The papers built him up, then smashed him.

388
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,450
The media haven't changed much in 40 years.

389
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,820
I remember something about that.

390
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:48,500
Didn't someone die?

391
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,970
Dr. Ikuma disappeared after his university fired him.

392
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,060
I doubt he's still alive.

393
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,820
Even if we found him, then what?

394
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,040
They say Shizuko had a daughter.

395
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,090
Anyone here?

396
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,200
Hello.

397
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,200
Welcome.

398
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,540
I'll leave you here.

399
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,250
This way.

400
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,690
One room?

401
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,290
Two, please.

402
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,300
This way.

403
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,910
Umm...

404
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,380
Please.

405
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,890
Wait!

406
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,110
Please tell me about Shizuko!

407
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,190
I have nothing to say.

408
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,760
About her daughter...

409
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,210
There was no daughter.

410
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,250
Not hungry?

411
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,130
When I die, be with me...

412
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,970
Cut it out.

413
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,890
Please!

414
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,830
Please?  And then...

415
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,210
If you learn anything, use it to save Yoichi!

416
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:29,730
Stop it!

417
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,190
The girl with Tomoko lost her mind.

418
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,810
Who knows what'll happen to me?

419
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,680
You'll be all right!

420
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,520
Because I'm not ``normal''.

421
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,310
Maybe all three of us should just die.

422
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:57,530
Good idea!  We shouldn't have had a kid in the first place.

423
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,320
STOP IT!

424
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,030
There are still two days.

425
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,790
Excuse me.

426
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,310
Come in.

427
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,940
You were asking about Shizuko...

428
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,920
This is all that's left.

429
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,600
Is this Dr. Ikuma?

430
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,720
Yes.  It was before I came here.

431
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:38,250
Anyway...

432
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,830
Thank you.

433
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:50,020
``Frolic in brine...

434
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,110
...goblins be thine.''

435
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:09,880
Sunday, September 19th

436
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,440
You'd best head home early.

437
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,410
There's a storm coming tonight.

438
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:38,180
What was Shizuko like?

439
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,820
She was a strange one.

440
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:46,130
She'd sit out here the whole day long.

441
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:52,100
Day in, day out... just staring at the sea.

442
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,910
The fisherman all hated her.

443
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,900
For us, the sea is unlucky.

444
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,910
Every year, it swallows some of us.

445
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,740
And she'd just stare out at it...

446
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,940
``Frolic in brine, goblins be thine''...

447
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,130
If you play in the sea, the goblins come for you.

448
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,110
Shizuko could read minds.

449
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,680
She would know things about people they didn't want known.

450
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,740
That could be painful.

451
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,170
Go home!

452
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:39,690
I have some abilities that way myself.

453
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:45,250
You're the one who told people about Shizuko, aren't you?

454
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,210
You called Dr. Ikuma.

455
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,280
I did what?

456
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,020
You thought you could make money off of Shizuko.

457
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,210
You took money from the newspapers, too.

458
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,120
Shut up!

459
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,340
Tell me about her daughter!  What happened to her?

460
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:05,900
I don't know!

461
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,310
She should have been with Shizuko!

462
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,000
You were there...

463
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,620
...when Shizuko gave her demonstration.

464
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,320
Correct.

465
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,800
Correct.

466
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,480
Correct.

467
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,210
Correct.

468
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,060
Correct.

469
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,380
This is a fraud!

470
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:22,390
It's nothing but a vulgar magic show!

471
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,290
You don't fool me!

472
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,020
Dr. Ikuma is deceiving you!

473
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,210
He's making a fool of you!

474
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,010
Show us the...

475
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,520
Hey!  What's wrong?

476
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,580
He's dead!

477
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,460
She's a monster!

478
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,630
Sadako!  You did that!

479
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,540
``Sadako''?

480
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,160
Sada

481
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,200
Sadako killed him?

482
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,130
She could simply kill someone dead?

483
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:17,600
She was a monster!

484
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,170
Sadako!

485
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,970
Hey!

486
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:12,310
Yes!  When Shizuko killed herself, Dr. Ikuma took Sadako away with him.

487
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:15,810
But no one knows where they went.

488
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,820
Anyway, find them!

489
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,140
Dr. Ikuma may be dead, but Sadako would be in her 40s.

490
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,660
I'll explain later.  Hurry!

491
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,030
I doubt Sadako is alive, either.

492
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:38,280
She killed a man just by willing him dead.

493
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,830
That's power of a different order from her mother.

494
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,900
So that video...

495
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,340
It's not of this world.

496
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:57,460
It's Sadako's... rage.

497
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,920
She's put a curse on us.

498
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:17,200
The typhoon's too close.  All the ferries have been canceled.

499
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,350
Try a fishing boat.  We'll pay.

500
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,790
A fishing boat?

501
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,320
The typhoon might change course.  Your best bet is to wait.

502
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,050
I'll find one, then!

503
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,560
Mr. Takayama!

504
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,150
Mr. Takayama!

505
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:54,870
Hello?

506
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,160
Ms. Asakawa?  I'm sorry.

507
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,100
There's no trace of either of them.

508
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,200
Hello?

509
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,210
Thank you.

510
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,930
Yoichi!

511
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,580
Izu!

512
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,760
Ryuji!

513
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,930
Ryuji...

514
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,790
The phone didn't ring at my house.

515
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,580
The only place it rang was at that cabin!

516
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,130
The doctor must've...

517
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,630
But we're stuck here.

518
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,970
You can't take a boat out on a night like this!

519
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,260
I'll take you.

520
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,930
Sadako's calling you, isn't she?

521
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:40,950
It may be that she wants me to drown.

522
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,540
Take us!

523
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,720
It's strange, isn't it?

524
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,720
I'm not afraid at all.

525
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,120
Sadako probably died there, before that cabin was built.

526
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,460
Was Sadako Dr. Ikuma's daughter?

527
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,900
He was married, with a family.

528
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:35,480
His relationship with Shizuko caused a scandal.

529
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,640
That helped in his being fired.

530
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,410
Let's find Sadako's body.

531
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,090
Will that lift the curse?  Will that save Yoichi?

532
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,660
It's all we can do.

533
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,580
Just one day left.

534
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,720
I guess Sadako doesn't hate you.

535
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,010
Shizuko used to talk to the sea.

536
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:39,760
She'd sit there and mumble to it.

537
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:45,120
I hid once and listened.

538
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,290
But it wasn't human language.

539
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:05,290
Monday, September 20th

540
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:14,920
Hello?

541
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,120
Yoichi?

542
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,850
I'll check back tomorrow.

543
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:24,370
I'm bored here.  I want to get back to school!

544
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,850
Don't say that!  You'll hurt Grandpa's feelings!

545
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,180
He's laughing.  Do you want to talk to him?

546
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,780
That's okay.

547
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:41,550
I'm sorry.

548
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,340
I'll hurry back.

549
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,780
What's wrong?

550
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:55,510
Mom has something she needs to do.

551
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:01,540
Say hello to Grandpa for me.

552
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,290
What time did you see the video?

553
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:26,990
Seven or eight minutes past 7.

554
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,580
If the story's true, that's your deadline.

555
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:11,740
Here.

556
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:33,120
A well?  I knew it!

557
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:34,760
A well?

558
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:24,370
Her father?

559
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:32,000
Dr. Ikuma put this lid on. Sadako's under here.

560
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,970
I'll go down.

561
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:04,210
Sadako was still alive!

562
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:08,930
She tried to climb out.

563
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:33,820
Lower the buckets!

564
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,480
Take it up!

565
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,380
Take it up!

566
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,580
Take it up!

567
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,020
It's 6 o'clock!

568
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,720
I know!  Hurry and take it up!

569
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,460
Take it up!

570
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,660
Asakawa!

571
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:42,400
Damn it!  Do you want to kill me?

572
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:44,810
Hey!

573
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,870
Asakawa!

574
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:13,210
Trade places.

575
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,810
You can't lift anymore.

576
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:19,690
No!

577
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,800
Then who's going to pull the pails up?

578
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:26,640
Is this really going to do any good?

579
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,050
And what about Yoichi?!

580
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,260
She'll go for him, too!

581
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,460
Don't look down!

582
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,250
Where are you?

583
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:21,320
Come out!

584
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,570
Please!  Where are you?

585
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,760
It's you.

586
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:28,970
Hey!  Asakawa!  It's past 7:10!

587
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,930
We're saved!

588
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:57,170
Why did he kill his own daughter?

589
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,900
Maybe she wasn't his daughter.

590
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,680
Huh?

591
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:10,820
Maybe her father wasn't human.

592
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:18,800
The marks are gone.

593
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,380
It's over.

594
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:26,550
I'll take you home.

595
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:22,120
Get some rest.  I've got a deadline.

596
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,420
Thank you.

597
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:34,230
Idiot!

598
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:08,880
Tuesday, September 21st

599
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,890
Why?!

600
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,060
That's it!  Asakawa!

601
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,160
Are you a resident?

602
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,860
I'm Takayama Ryuji's wife!!

603
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,150
The body's been taken away, Ma'am.

604
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:29,340
What happened?

605
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:34,330
When I got there, he was lying on the floor.

606
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:38,460
Did he say anything to you?  About a video, maybe?

607
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,790
Sensei's face...

608
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:00,880
Why Ryuji?

609
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:03,650
Will Yoichi die, too?

610
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,820
Didn't we lift the curse?

611
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,990
Why was I the only one saved?

612
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,150
Sadako's curse was only lifted from me.

613
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,810
Why not you, Ryuji?

614
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:21,420
What did I do that you didn't?

615
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,070
What did I do that you didn't?!

616
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,640
Ryuji?

617
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,610
Something I did that you didn't...

618
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:10,940
...to lift the curse...

619
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,240
I copied it!

620
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:24,350
I showed it to you...

621
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,020
Dad?  Yeah, I'm on my way.

622
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:53,090
I need a favor.  It's for Yoichi.

623
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,540
They say there's one way you can see it and not die.

624
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:04,580
You have to copy it and show it to someone else within one week.

625
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:06,800
And what happens to them?

626
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,620
They have to do the same thing.

627
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:09,940
So it never ends?

628
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,740
That's right.  It goes on and on.

629
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:17,970
But if you don't want to die, you'll do it, won't you?

630
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:38,210
Wednesday, September 22nd
