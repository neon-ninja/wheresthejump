00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:40,895
No press beyond this point.

163
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:44,899
<i>Alone at night
he crosses flames</i>

164
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:51,072
<i>Ashe makes a fist
with his red right hand</i>

165
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,452
Look, you're worried about the movie,
then protect the movie, okay?

166
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,538
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard. Just don't kill the movie.

167
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,708
Violence in cinema
is a big deal right now, Roman.

168
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,086
This is not the kind of news
this studio is after.

169
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:07,213
So if we stop making
scary movies, what?

170
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:09,299
All the psychos in the world
will retire? Come on.

171
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,927
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.

172
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:14,012
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?

173
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:18,183
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.

174
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,852
Detectives, there's no reason
to presume that Cotton's death...

175
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:23,021
had anything to do
with this movie, is there?

176
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:29,444
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.

177
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,907
<i>Probably some psycho fan pissed off
they killed Randy in Stab 2.</i>

178
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,992
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next,
wouldn't it?

179
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:39,037
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.

180
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:41,873
Named Ricky,
who works at the video store.

181
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:43,833
It's an homage.

182
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,170
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?

183
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,464
I mean, what the hell ever happened to
her? She's probably off in the woods...

184
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:52,050
livin' like
the fuckin' Unabomber, man.

185
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,262
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
didn't want to come back.

186
00:14:55,512 --> 00:15:00,016
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.

187
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:04,479
"We are not in any danger,"
says Candy, page 15.

188
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,564
I don't see you leavin'.

189
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,859
You think serious black actors
my age can just throw away jobs?

190
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,947
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.

191
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,241
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.

192
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:18,868
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.

193
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,539
Not meant to be? You win that
talent search for the new Sidney.

194
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:27,127
50,000 girls and they pick you. You
gotta be praying this movie keeps going.

195
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:30,005
Of course I am, but not
at the expense of people's lives.

196
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:35,218
Oh. Cue the violins, right?

197
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,607
Jesus.

198
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:54,654
Deja voodoo.

199
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:59,784
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.

200
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:02,579
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.

201
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,707
L... Listen,
l-l... I know we've never met...

202
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:08,293
and I don't mind you never returning
my calls, but I have to tell you...

203
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:12,047
after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.

204
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:16,384
Well, that would explain
my constant headaches.

205
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,471
You know, I'm sorry things didn't
work out on 60 Minutes II.

206
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:22,307
<i>- But Total Entertainment,
that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.</i>

207
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,768
I'm sorry that things didn't
work out with Brad Pitt...

208
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,978
but being single,
that's a pretty good fallback.

209
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:29,064
Gives me more time
for my work.

210
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,858
After all, Gale Weathers,
you're such a complex character.

211
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:36,363
Oh, and to be played by an actress
with such depth and range.

212
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:40,367
Uh, Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to...

213
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,993
Gale.

214
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:45,247
Dewey.

215
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:50,794
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.

216
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:55,257
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate
my character work in this one.

217
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:59,135
- Someone's helped me
understand the real you.
- Someone?

218
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:03,556
Your ruthless ambition,
your private self-loathing...

219
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,559
and that lost and lonely
little girl inside.

220
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,645
Lost and lonely what?

221
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,023
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.

222
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,609
Lost and lonely what?

223
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,363
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were
supposed to be in Woodsboro.

224
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:20,865
Well, I'm surprised
you thought about me at all.

225
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:25,120
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.

226
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,539
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,457
The movie needed
a technical advisor.

228
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,252
Someone who went through the real
experience, knew the real people.

229
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:35,714
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.

230
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,883
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.

231
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:41,219
Real from top to bottom.

232
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:43,555
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.

233
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:48,143
You're so right. Pop culture
is the politics ofthe 21 st century.

234
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:50,145
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did...

235
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,564
last month on me crashing my car?

236
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:55,942
- Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
- Right, uh...

237
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:59,404
I especially liked the way
you implied that it was caused
by drinking and drugs.

238
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:02,532
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.

239
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,743
Tom, sometimes in journalism
you have to...

240
00:18:04,993 --> 00:18:07,412
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure...

241
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:12,375
that nobody's messed
with your brake line.

242
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:17,172
Who's he supposed to be?

243
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:22,218
He's playing you? Him?

244
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,512
What?

245
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,932
I did not come here
to fight with you, Dewey.

246
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:30,143
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.

247
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,104
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?

248
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:35,982
Listen, Sidney doesn't need
you and your camera in her life.

249
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:39,653
Do you see a camera?

250
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,156
Right. You bought me
this purse, didn't you?

251
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,242
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.

252
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,285
- I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
- What the hell is this?

253
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,120
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?

254
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,706
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.

255
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,417
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.

256
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,837
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?

257
00:18:58,088 --> 00:18:59,923
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.

258
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:07,264
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.

259
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:11,142
<i>Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up
ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.</i>

260
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,478
Now, does anybody
need a potty break?

261
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:15,981
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.

262
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:19,859
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.

263
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,989
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!

264
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:27,450
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?

265
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:33,331
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?

266
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,751
<i>It's happening again.</i>

267
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:39,421
Cotton had a lot
of enemies, Sid.

268
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:43,425
The police aren't saying
it's related to us.

269
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:47,679
Do you ever think about her?

270
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,140
Your mom?

271
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,476
None of this would've
ever happened if she hadn't...

272
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,230
if she hadn't...

273
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,860
Why'd she have
so many secrets, Dad?

274
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,197
Listen, maybe it's time
you came home.

275
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:09,993
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here
by yourself. You never see anyone.

276
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,955
The only people you talk to
don't even know your real name.

277
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:17,876
It's as if you don't exist.

278
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:25,508
That's the idea. Psychos
can't kill what they can't find.

279
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,714
Sid, come here.

280
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:48,592
Mother needs to talk to you.

281
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:52,387
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!

282
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:56,349
You're poison.
You're just like me.

283
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,478
You're just like me.

284
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:06,568
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?

285
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:09,446
They'll do it to you.

286
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:13,533
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?

287
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:06,211
Roman?

288
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:12,384
<i>Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.</i>

289
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:16,721
Roman?

290
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,524
Someone here?

291
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,491
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?

292
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,577
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.

293
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:42,706
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.

294
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:45,792
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?

295
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,420
Look, everyone in the office
has gone home already.

296
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:53,550
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.

297
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:20,118
Oh, shit!

298
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,669
<i>- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.</i>

299
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,839
<i>I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still
on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.</i>

300
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:37,552
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just
lookin' at your music video awards.

301
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:41,181
<i>Since I got you on thephone, let's...
let's talk about your character, okay?</i>

302
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:44,434
What character? I'm Candy,
the chick who gets killed second.

303
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,854
<i>- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.</i>

304
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:51,942
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.

305
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,152
I'm not happy
that I have to die naked.

306
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:57,239
And I'm not happy that my character is
too stupid to have a gun in the house...

307
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:00,325
after her boyfriend's
been cut into fish sticks.

308
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:03,828
<i>Great, okay.
So let's... let's run the lines.</i>

309
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,705
Fine.

310
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:10,460
<i>Page28.
Candy's big moment.</i>

311
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,798
Page 28.

312
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:17,384
Ring-ring.
Hello?

313
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:20,095
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

314
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:22,389
<i>- Who's this?
- This is Candy.</i>

315
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,516
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.

316
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,644
See? I don't understand why I have
to start the scene in the shower.

317
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:31,356
<i>The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?</i>

318
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:35,902
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?

319
00:25:36,152 --> 00:25:38,196
<i>Why don't we just read the scene?</i>

320
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:43,410
<i>Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?</i>

321
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,954
Whatever.

322
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:48,331
Come on.
Who is this?

323
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:50,750
I think you have
the wrong number.

324
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:54,504
<i>- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.</i>

325
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,590
<i>It's Sarah.</i>

326
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,093
Roman, that's not the line.

327
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:02,762
<i>It is in my script.</i>

328
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:05,807
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck...

329
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:08,935
are we supposed to learn our lines when
there's a new script every 15 minutes?

330
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:13,023
<i>It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.</i>

331
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:16,568
<i>- What? What movie?
- My movie.</i>

332
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:21,907
<i>And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!</i>

333
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:27,287
<i>Still in character, Sarah?</i>

334
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:45,805
Shit.

335
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:10,080
<i>Thank you for calling
Sunrise Picture Studios.</i>

336
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>If you'd like today's
commissary menu, press one.</i>

337
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:19,464
Mr Bridger?

338
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,522
<i>If you'd like to hear previews of
upcoming Sunrise Pictures'releases...</i>

339
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:36,898
<i>press four.</i>

340
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,109
<i>If you'd like information about
Sunrise Pictures' merchandise...</i>

341
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,320
<i>- Come on. Come on.
- Press five.</i>

342
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:48,326
<i>If you're trying to reach Lot Security
or you have an emergency, press six.</i>

343
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:59,254
Shit!

344
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,847
Oh! Fuck!

345
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,573
Look, I wanna get something straight.

346
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:31,453
I only got into this because
the police asked for my help.

347
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,663
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write...

348
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:35,916
the definitive book
on the Woodsboro murders.

349
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,960
I'm sure you just can't wait
to write another one.

350
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,755
- What about you?
- What about me?

351
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:46,551
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."

352
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,889
But now you're here.
Not with me.

353
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,475
Dewey, I took care ofyou.

354
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:56,311
I waited until you were well,
but I couldn't stay there.

355
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:59,648
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.

356
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:04,694
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?

357
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,572
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.

358
00:29:07,822 --> 00:29:09,658
- I couldn't say no. I could've
been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.

359
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:15,121
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.

360
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:19,834
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.

361
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:23,755
You used to say
that was our strength.

362
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:29,261
- Well...
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

363
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:33,431
Dewey, you're not just here because
of that second-rate K-Mart...

364
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:35,517
straight-to-video
version of me, are you?

365
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:42,190
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.

366
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:47,487
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?

367
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:50,615
- Off the record?
- Always.

368
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:53,577
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police
got a call from a woman...

369
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,662
who said she was with Stab 3.

370
00:29:55,912 --> 00:29:58,498
She wanted to see the file
on Sid, "for research."

371
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:00,584
- And?
- The boys said no.

372
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,669
And she wouldn't give her name.

373
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:05,422
A month later,
the station gets broken into.

374
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:08,550
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?

375
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,304
I already removed it.

376
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:15,765
I think someone on the film
is tryin' to find Sid.

377
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:20,812
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."

378
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:24,441
Right.

379
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:28,194
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.

380
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:30,822
- Jennifer?
- Gotta run.

381
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:34,910
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.

382
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,258
Stop following me.

383
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:53,595
I happen to be working
for the police, damn it!

384
00:30:53,845 --> 00:30:57,307
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.

385
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:01,394
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.

386
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:05,982
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want
a picture, they want a conversation.

387
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,485
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?

388
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:12,405
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and
a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.

389
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:16,326
- Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.

390
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:18,954
Like I'm ever going
to win an award playing you.

391
00:31:19,204 --> 00:31:22,207
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?

392
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:24,292
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?

393
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,878
- At the studio.
- Where? Nancy Drew
wants to know where.

394
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:30,173
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?

395
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:35,053
Someone's killing them in the order
they die in the movie.

396
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:40,809
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?

397
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,483
You do.

398
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:59,995
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?

399
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:02,831
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?

400
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:05,458
I have to get something
from my trailer.

401
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:08,670
Your...
You live here with her?

402
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,631
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

403
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:14,301
I needed a place to stay,
and she said she liked having me around.

404
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:18,471
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.

405
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:21,600
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?

406
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,519
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned
with pretensions and appearances...

407
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,564
you'd be able to appreciate the
positivity and emotional centeredness...

408
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:31,651
I provide a woman.

409
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:35,864
Stone, I'm headed
to the crime scene.

410
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:41,661
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.

411
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:45,165
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?

412
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:49,377
Just so it can be straight. I'm
the professional celebrity guard here.

413
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:52,213
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.

414
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:55,258
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.

415
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:57,636
'Cause you're just no good
as a cop any more.

416
00:32:57,886 --> 00:32:59,638
Your resume reads
like the obituaries.

417
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:02,557
So how about you take suggestions
from me? All right?

418
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:06,311
Whatever you say.

419
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:09,147
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?

420
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:12,609
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.

421
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,362
Ten more murders
and we can publish a calendar.

422
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:17,447
The old "killer playing
with the cops" routine.

423
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:21,368
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.

424
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:24,079
Doesn't the killer come after
the cops in those movies?

425
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,164
Usually one cop makes it.

426
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:30,543
- And?
- One cop doesn't.

427
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:32,629
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.

428
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:35,257
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.

429
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:38,635
<i>Terminal Entertainment,
this is a crime scene, okay?</i>

430
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:40,929
Wallace, Miss Weathers
is working with me now.

431
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:42,889
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.

432
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,726
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust
for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.

433
00:33:46,977 --> 00:33:50,814
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.

434
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:53,900
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?

435
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,529
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased
police presence around Jennifer?

436
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:01,283
- She's the next one
to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.

437
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:04,369
And besides, the producers told us
that there were three different
versions of the script.

438
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,122
Something about trying to keep
the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.

439
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:10,166
You're the technical advisor, right?

440
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,169
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.

441
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,630
And we don't know which one
the killer read.

442
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,301
Hey, hold up.

443
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:23,305
<i>All I ever wanted to do
was make a real classic lovestory.</i>

444
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:26,266
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do
a scary movie for them first.

445
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:28,643
And now we're shut down,
and I am fucked!

446
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:30,979
God, it's not the end
of the world, Roman.

447
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:35,191
That is so easy for you to say. You can
always go back to, to MustSee TV.

448
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:39,863
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it
looks like I'm now the next target.

449
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:43,617
- What?
- You? Why you?

450
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:45,869
Do you think this wasn't a message?

451
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,580
- Roman Bridger?
- What?

452
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,707
Mr Bridger,
you didn't tell us...

453
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:53,168
you spoke with Sarah Darling
before she was murdered.

454
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:55,045
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?

455
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:58,381
The guard said she was here
for a meeting with you.

456
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:00,967
- What meeting? I don't...
- We talked with her roommate too.

457
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:04,054
Says you called Sarah,
told her to come down to the studio.

458
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:06,139
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.

459
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:08,225
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.

460
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,352
Roommate says she knows
your voice, Mr Bridger.

461
00:35:10,602 --> 00:35:14,856
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.

462
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:18,193
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.

463
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:20,111
Someone wants to kill
my movie!

464
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:22,739
All right, we'll talk about
your movie down at the station.

465
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:25,909
- All right.
- This is the scene
where you come with us.

466
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,287
Dewey, Jennifer...
Wait a minute.

467
00:35:29,537 --> 00:35:32,374
She wasn't talking with me
on the phone. I'm coming!

468
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:37,420
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley,
do you have a cell phone I can borrow?

469
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:41,007
Yeah.

470
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:43,969
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.

471
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:46,805
Remind me not
to sleep with him again.

472
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:50,559
Come here, Cherokee.

473
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,229
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?

474
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:58,400
<i>Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.</i>

475
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,236
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

476
00:36:01,486 --> 00:36:06,032
<i>Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.</i>

477
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:08,118
<i>- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.</i>

478
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:11,413
<i>I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.</i>

479
00:36:11,663 --> 00:36:14,040
<i>- Well, then, um...
- I did.</i>

480
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,084
Then the people you need to call
are the police.

481
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:20,630
<i>No, I need to call you!
Just you.</i>

482
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,716
I'm sorry, your-your voice...

483
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:28,346
<i>Don't you wanna know
how you can help, Laura?</i>

484
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:33,977
<i>Are you listening to me?
Huh?</i>

485
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:37,439
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.</i>

486
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:41,276
<i>Now, be a good girl
and turn on the news.</i>

487
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:45,113
<i>Do as Mother tells you!</i>

488
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:48,116
You're not my mother. How did you
get this number? Who is this?

489
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:51,119
<i>You know your mother's voice
when you hear it!</i>

490
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:55,665
<i>Now, turn on the news!</i>

491
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,377
<i>And with a second cast member
murdered, Stab 3...</i>

492
00:36:59,628 --> 00:37:02,213
<i>has been officially shut down,
prompting those involved...</i>

493
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:04,591
<i>to hope and pray that
these killings maybe over.</i>

494
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,551
<i>Just one question.</i>

495
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:11,932
<i>Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?</i>

496
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:39,459
<i>The sky was dark this morning</i>

497
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:44,172
<i>Not a bird in a tree</i>

498
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:53,098
Is this a wrap party
or is this a wrap party?

499
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:57,143
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."

500
00:37:57,394 --> 00:38:01,189
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.

501
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,316
Scenes 40 through 47.

502
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:08,280
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.

503
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,323
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.

504
00:38:10,574 --> 00:38:12,701
Scaring you?

505
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:16,288
Give the sweet,
young ingenue act a rest.

506
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:21,084
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.

507
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:25,630
I bet she fought and clawed
for that Sidney part.

508
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,466
I bet she stepped on any poor girl
that got in her way.

509
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:32,929
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.

510
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,473
Right.
Come on, Dewey.

511
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:37,934
Scene 50.

512
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:42,272
"Dewey Saves the Day."

513
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:12,928
She's so focused on success
that she never thinks...

514
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:15,013
about who she's hurting
to get it.

515
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:17,224
And you saved her life, like,
how many times?

516
00:39:17,474 --> 00:39:19,309
Gale wants the whole world
to love her.

517
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,229
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.

518
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:25,690
- No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
- No, she's not.

519
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:27,984
She's got a good heart.
She does.

520
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:34,574
She just hides it away because
she thinks people see that as weak.

521
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:38,286
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.

522
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:40,705
God, Dewey.

523
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:44,000
You make it sound like
you're still in love with her.

524
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:46,086
And I left out the part
that she's cruel...

525
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:52,342
and selfish,
obsessive and annoying.

526
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:55,595
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.

527
00:39:55,845 --> 00:40:00,809
Hey, Dewdrop,
got your girlfriend out here.

528
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,106
Look who I found slinkin'
around the yard. The nightly news.

529
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:08,275
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.

530
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:10,902
You were eaves dropping
at the bedroom window.

531
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:13,738
Yeah, a bedroom that
you seemed awfully at home in.

532
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:16,616
All right, let's talk.

533
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:19,869
Come on.

534
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,872
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?

535
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,874
Sarah's call didn't come
from his cell phone.

536
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:28,795
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.

537
00:40:29,045 --> 00:40:31,548
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?

538
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:36,011
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.

539
00:40:36,511 --> 00:40:38,847
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?

540
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:41,600
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought,
so I checked it out.

541
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,312
I cannot find any information about
her at this age. I mean, nothing.

542
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:49,149
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.

543
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,735
Almost her whole life.
Two years before...

544
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:54,446
she met Sidney's father,
she left Woodsboro.

545
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:57,115
No one has any idea
where she went or what she did.

546
00:40:57,365 --> 00:41:01,578
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into
a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!

547
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:03,663
- So?
- So?

548
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:06,499
Why is the killer
leaving pictures of-of Maureen?

549
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:11,463
And why these pictures at-at...
at that point in her life?

550
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,758
I don't know! If I thought
like a homicidal maniac...

551
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,762
then I'd know how
a homicidal maniac thinks.

552
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:24,768
What?

553
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:29,439
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer?

554
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:35,946
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.

555
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:39,115
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.

556
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:43,787
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was
at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!

557
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:47,707
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.

558
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:02,389
Steven Stone
Protection Services.

559
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,474
<i>Stone, where are you?</i>

560
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:07,269
I'm just checking
your tin can, Dewdrop.

561
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,271
<i>Well, come back inside
and stay with Jennifer.</i>

562
00:42:09,521 --> 00:42:11,606
<i>Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.</i>

563
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:16,027
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.

564
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:20,907
<i>Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?</i>

565
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:23,118
<i>- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?</i>

566
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:25,620
I'm just checking to make sure
there's no killer in here...

567
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,540
waitin' to off you
like he did your little sister.

568
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,710
<i>What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.</i>

569
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,170
<i>That makes me...</i>

570
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:38,091
angry!

571
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:41,344
Fucker!

572
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:56,526
Gotta call Kincaid.

573
00:43:01,072 --> 00:43:05,785
Dewey, where is everybody?

574
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:13,335
- Oh, God.
- Jennifer?

575
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:17,047
Angelina?
Tom?

576
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:21,760
Oh, my God!
What happened?

577
00:43:23,303 --> 00:43:27,515
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.

578
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:31,561
Dewdrop?

579
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:40,278
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!

580
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:42,864
Oh, God, Stone!

581
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:46,368
Oh, God!

582
00:43:49,537 --> 00:43:54,918
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.

583
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:59,256
Everyone back inside!

584
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:05,095
It's all right.
Don't panic.

585
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:09,516
Okay, outside. Everyone,
stay together and try to remain calm.

586
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:11,601
A phone!

587
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:14,229
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

588
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:18,149
Shit!
It's the fax.

589
00:44:25,407 --> 00:44:27,742
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living
room, night." It's a script page.

590
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:31,871
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death,
the five stand trapped.

591
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:34,332
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside...

592
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,543
suddenly the fax machine
sends news of their fates."

593
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:38,670
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!

594
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,006
- Outside where he can
pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!

595
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:43,258
"The killer prepares to grant
mercy to only one of them."

596
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:46,678
Don't you get it? The killer says he's
outside because he wants us here inside.

597
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:49,055
- Which one is it?
- Come on!

598
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:51,308
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?

599
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:55,103
- The killer will give mercy to..."
- Everyone outside!

600
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:58,523
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!

601
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:01,318
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!

602
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,403
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.

603
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:06,114
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.

604
00:45:06,364 --> 00:45:08,408
- What's it say?
- "And the...

605
00:45:08,658 --> 00:45:10,660
killer will give mercy to...

606
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:13,413
- whoever..."
- Whoever?

607
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:16,041
Whoever?

608
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,918
Piece of shit.

609
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:23,632
"Whoever...
Whoever smells the..."

610
00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:41,983
I can't stop
rolling down the hill!

611
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:55,288
Gale! Jennifer!

612
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:57,332
- Dewey!
- Dewey!

613
00:45:57,582 --> 00:45:59,459
Dewey, where are you?

614
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:03,463
Over here, Dewey!

615
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:09,970
- Dewey!
- Gale!

616
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:13,932
Gale, behind you!

617
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:26,403
Dewey!
Are you all right?

618
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,698
Yeah, never been better.

619
00:46:29,948 --> 00:46:32,367
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?

620
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:36,997
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.

621
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:47,465
Is he back there?

622
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:50,343
- No.
- No?

623
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:55,140
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.

624
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:01,771
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

625
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:04,065
Thanks for saving me.

626
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:07,819
Ah, it's habit.

627
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:13,033
Oh, God.

628
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:17,746
What the fuck happened to you?

629
00:47:17,996 --> 00:47:20,332
- Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?

630
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:23,835
- Who are you supposed to be protecting?
- Jennifer!

631
00:47:24,085 --> 00:47:28,089
Hey!

632
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:35,722
My lawyer liked that.

633
00:47:35,972 --> 00:47:39,809
Not as much as I did.

634
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:47,609
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.

635
00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:53,573
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!

636
00:47:55,492 --> 00:48:00,205
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?

637
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:07,212
Wait a second!

638
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:13,969
Another picture.

639
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:21,518
<i>Whoever it is is now taking credit
for Maureen Prescott's murder.</i>

640
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:24,688
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.

641
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:27,148
- I mean, they even told Sidney
how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken...

642
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:29,484
you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.

643
00:48:29,734 --> 00:48:32,320
She accused Cotton Weary
of murdering her mother.

644
00:48:32,571 --> 00:48:35,407
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.

645
00:48:35,657 --> 00:48:37,576
Sidney might know something.

646
00:48:37,826 --> 00:48:40,203
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.

647
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:42,872
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.

648
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:46,251
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.

649
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:48,587
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain...

650
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:51,131
why there are three dead celebrities
and a bodyguard.

651
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:53,967
And a very angry mayor.

652
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:56,052
Okay, look, we all know this has
something to do with Stab 3.

653
00:48:56,303 --> 00:48:59,139
But what we do not know is why
the killer keeps leaving pictures...

654
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:01,600
of Maureen Prescott
taken over 25 years ago.

655
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,436
And the photographs taken at the same
studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.

656
00:49:04,686 --> 00:49:06,146
What does this
have to do with Sid?

657
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:08,940
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?

658
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,736
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you,
and he was married to Maureen.

659
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:14,738
What's your problem?

660
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:19,367
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?

661
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:21,578
Do you wanna have this
conversation with a polygraph?

662
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:27,208
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.

663
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:29,586
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.

664
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:32,130
Why don't we compare
our gun calibres later?

665
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,550
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.

666
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,512
And either Mr Riley is going
to obstruct justice or he's going
to put me in touch with her.

667
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:44,976
So, where is she?

668
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:50,690
<i>Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.</i>

669
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:53,568
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.

670
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:57,739
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're...

671
00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:00,367
okay.

672
00:50:00,617 --> 00:50:04,537
- Sid!
- Dewey!

673
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:07,290
What are you doing down here?

674
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,585
Actually, what was I doing up there?

675
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:13,922
- Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.

676
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:16,967
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.

677
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:19,803
It'd take a direct hit.

678
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:24,349
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?

679
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:27,435
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.

680
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:31,106
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.

681
00:50:31,356 --> 00:50:33,483
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.

682
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:39,114
I'm no more safe there than I am here,
and at least here I'm not alone.

683
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:43,243
Okay, come on.

684
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,787
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.

685
00:50:46,037 --> 00:50:48,456
There's someone here
who wants to help.

686
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:51,209
Oh, my God.
Sidney.

687
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,378
Is the man fast or what?

688
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:57,966
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.

689
00:50:58,216 --> 00:51:01,261
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

690
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:06,057
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

691
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:09,477
- The killer called her.
- What? When?

692
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:11,980
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.

693
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,482
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?

694
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:17,611
Sidney, do you have any idea
how he could've gotten your number?

695
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:20,822
He could have monitored her calls on a
scanner. Did you call her from the set?

696
00:51:21,072 --> 00:51:24,034
- No.
- Do you have her number
stored in your memory?

697
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:28,288
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.

698
00:51:28,538 --> 00:51:32,417
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
- Just Jennifer.

699
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:34,544
And you.

700
00:51:34,794 --> 00:51:39,507
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.

701
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:46,848
The killer leaves a photograph
after each murder, Sidney.

702
00:51:47,098 --> 00:51:50,060
They were taken in Hollywood at the same
studio that they're shooting Stab 3.

703
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,146
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.

704
00:51:53,396 --> 00:51:55,941
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.

705
00:51:56,191 --> 00:51:58,151
Something to, you know,
trick you out of hiding.

706
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:01,947
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot
like publicity stills.

707
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:05,242
I, uh, don't know.

708
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:08,370
Detective, I wanna see
this place in the pictures.

709
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:14,084
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

710
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:18,588
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.

711
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:22,342
Watch the fuckin' aliens.

712
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:26,137
I'm gonna go talk to
the studio brass about those photos.

713
00:52:26,388 --> 00:52:28,223
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.

714
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:30,600
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.

715
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,395
You're gonna get her some flowers
and candy, huh? Huh?

716
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:35,480
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.

717
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:39,234
Just keep your eye on her.

718
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,369
That stairwell over there, that's
where one of the pictures was taken.

719
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:52,205
God. I can't believe
she never mentioned any of this.

720
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:53,748
- She probably just...
- Dewey!

721
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:55,542
- Sorry.
- Martha!

722
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,669
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!

723
00:52:57,919 --> 00:53:00,046
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.

724
00:53:00,297 --> 00:53:02,090
We do?

725
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,342
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.

726
00:53:04,593 --> 00:53:07,095
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?

727
00:53:07,345 --> 00:53:09,806
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.

728
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:15,729
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.

729
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:21,985
<i>Told ya I'd make
a movie someday. Huh?</i>

730
00:53:22,235 --> 00:53:25,447
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...</i>

731
00:53:25,697 --> 00:53:27,532
<i>it means, as I feared, I did not
survive these killings...</i>

732
00:53:27,782 --> 00:53:30,368
<i>here at Windsor College,
and that giving up my virginity...</i>

733
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:33,246
<i>to Karen Kolchakat the video store
was probably not a good idea.</i>

734
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:35,707
<i>- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.</i>

735
00:53:35,957 --> 00:53:38,460
<i>- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?</i>

736
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,212
<i>We were workin'late. We were puttin'
away some videos in the porno section...</i>

737
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:44,007
<i>and, you know, shit happens.</i>

738
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:47,469
<i>- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.</i>

739
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:50,263
<i>- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.</i>

740
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:53,266
<i>I'm leaving my legacy.</i>

741
00:53:53,516 --> 00:53:57,312
<i>Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...</i>

742
00:53:57,562 --> 00:54:01,816
<i>the reason I'm here is to help you so
that my death will not be in vain.</i>

743
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:07,155
<i>That my life's work will help save some
other poor soul from getting mutilated.</i>

744
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:09,783
<i>If this killer does come back
and he's for real...</i>

745
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:11,952
<i>there are a few things
that you gotta remember.</i>

746
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:15,205
<i>Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.</i>

747
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:17,791
<i>But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...</i>

748
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:20,335
<i>with an unexpected back-story
and ap reponderance...</i>

749
00:54:20,585 --> 00:54:23,171
<i>of exposition,
then the sequel rules do not apply.</i>

750
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:26,925
<i>Because you're not dealing with
the sequel. You are dealing with...</i>

751
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:30,220
<i>the concluding chapter
of a trilogy.</i>

752
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,973
<i>- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's
a rarity in the horror field...</i>

753
00:54:33,223 --> 00:54:35,850
<i>but it does exist, and it is
a force to be reckoned with.</i>

754
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:39,563
<i>Because true trilogies are all about
going back to the beginning...</i>

755
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:41,940
<i>and discovering something
that wasn 't true from the get-go.</i>

756
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,693
<i>Godfather, Jedi,
all revealed something...</i>

757
00:54:44,943 --> 00:54:47,153
<i>that we thought was true
that wasn 't true.</i>

758
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:49,614
<i>So if it is a trilogy
you are dealing with...</i>

759
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:53,034
<i>here are some super
trilogy rules.</i>

760
00:54:53,285 --> 00:54:54,911
<i>One: You've got a killer
who's gonna be superhuman.</i>

761
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:56,997
<i>Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.</i>

762
00:54:57,247 --> 00:54:59,541
<i>Basically, in the third one, you've
gotta cryogenically freeze his head...</i>

763
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:01,459
<i>decapitate him or blowhim up.</i>

764
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,629
<i>Number two: Anyone, including
the main character, can die.</i>

765
00:55:04,879 --> 00:55:08,049
<i>This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.</i>

766
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,760
<i>It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs
by the time this thing is through.</i>

767
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:13,763
<i>Number three: The past will
come back to bite you in the ass.</i>

768
00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:15,849
<i>Whatever you think you know
about the past, forget it.</i>

769
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:18,268
<i>The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...</i>

770
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:23,815
<i>were committed in the past are about
to break out and destroy you.</i>

771
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:28,028
<i>So in closing,
let me say...</i>

772
00:55:28,278 --> 00:55:30,780
<i>goodluck, Godspeed...</i>

773
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:35,035
<i>and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.</i>

774
00:55:35,285 --> 00:55:38,580
<i>'Cause the rules say some of you
ain't gonna make it. I didn't.</i>

775
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,376
<i>Not if you're watching this tape.</i>

776
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,719
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.

777
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:55,222
You be careful too, Sid.

778
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:58,016
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.

779
00:55:58,266 --> 00:56:02,270
- Thank you.
- Bye.

780
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:06,858
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.

781
00:56:07,108 --> 00:56:09,402
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.

782
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:13,448
Why don't you try to figure out where
those other pictures were taken.

783
00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:17,994
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.

784
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,419
Oh, shit.

785
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:30,090
Hello!

786
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:41,017
- Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?

787
00:56:41,268 --> 00:56:43,228
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?

788
00:56:43,478 --> 00:56:45,438
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.

789
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:48,483
I've got no house, no bodyguard,
no movie, and I'm being stalked.

790
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:50,902
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.

791
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:53,280
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.

792
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,949
That way, if someone wants
to kill me, I'll be with you.

793
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:58,326
And since they really want to kill you,
they won't kill me, they'll kill you.

794
00:56:58,577 --> 00:57:00,245
- Make sense?
- None.

795
00:57:00,495 --> 00:57:02,372
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.

796
00:57:02,622 --> 00:57:05,959
And as a sane person.
For you, that must be quite a stretch.

797
00:57:06,209 --> 00:57:08,211
- That's funny.
- Ha!

798
00:57:08,461 --> 00:57:10,297
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.

799
00:57:10,547 --> 00:57:12,382
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.

800
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:16,386
Gale Weathers would find a way.

801
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:20,682
Bitch. All right, wait. Just...

802
00:57:20,932 --> 00:57:24,185
Don't tell me what to do.

803
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:32,068
Basements, wow.

804
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,237
Basements creep me out.

805
00:57:34,487 --> 00:57:37,991
You'd make
a fascinating interview.

806
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:44,414
Hello?

807
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:54,549
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers...

808
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:58,970
and I'm here researching
with the police this photo.

809
00:57:59,221 --> 00:58:01,598
It was taken at the studio.
Her name is Maureen Prescott.

810
00:58:01,848 --> 00:58:04,684
Back then it was probably Roberts.

811
00:58:04,935 --> 00:58:07,270
- Hey, are you...
- No.

812
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,648
- But you look just...
- Like her?

813
00:58:09,898 --> 00:58:12,234
- I've been hearing it all my life.
- It's uncanny.

814
00:58:12,484 --> 00:58:15,570
I was up for Princess Leia.
I was this close.

815
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,490
So, who gets it?
The one who sleeps with George Lucas.

816
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,368
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
a-a sore subject for you.

817
00:58:21,618 --> 00:58:23,703
Sure, you didn't.
None of them did.

818
00:58:23,954 --> 00:58:28,333
So, how can I help you? Or do you want
me to tell you who you look like?

819
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:31,044
How about some information
on Maureen Roberts?

820
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:33,880
I don't work for the cops, sweetie.
I work for the studio.

821
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:39,094
Really? Well,
would you work for...

822
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,097
the president?

823
00:58:42,347 --> 00:58:46,101
The president of the studio.

824
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:51,731
Fifty dollars? Who are you?
A reporter for Woodsboro High?

825
00:58:57,946 --> 00:59:00,031
It's worth two grand.

826
00:59:00,282 --> 00:59:04,119
Are you gonna help
Gale Weathers or not?

827
00:59:05,078 --> 00:59:07,247
I know every face in here.

828
00:59:07,497 --> 00:59:09,791
I got a respect
for the unknown actor.

829
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:15,422
If they're looking for Maureen Roberts,
they're never gonna find her.

830
00:59:15,463 --> 00:59:18,884
Rina Reynolds they will.

831
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:22,888
Rina Reynolds.
Stage name.

832
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:26,808
You should talk, Judy Jurgenstern.

833
00:59:30,353 --> 00:59:32,522
<i>What are these movies?
Amazombies, Space Psycho...</i>

834
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:34,608
<i>Creatures from the San Andreas Fault.</i>

835
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:37,986
Horror pictures
back in Milton's heyday.

836
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:40,322
- Back in what?
- Back in what?
- John Milton.

837
00:59:40,572 --> 00:59:44,868
The horror producer?
Those were his movies.

838
01:00:14,606 --> 01:00:18,109
Come on, Sid.

839
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:46,930
Oh, my God!
Sidney Prescott!

840
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:50,725
Oh, my God! I'm Angelina Tyler.
I'm you! I mean, I'm not.

841
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:55,063
I mean, I was.

842
01:00:58,608 --> 01:01:00,443
I-I thought... Well,
if there's no movie...

843
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:02,654
then no one would care
if I took some souvenirs.

844
01:01:02,904 --> 01:01:05,907
Souvenirs?

845
01:01:06,157 --> 01:01:08,618
I may never win another role,
so these may be...

846
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:11,663
my only memories,
you know, of Hollywood.

847
01:01:11,913 --> 01:01:15,333
I-I know it's weird 'cause
it's your life and all, but...

848
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,670
I wanted to make you proud, Sidney.

849
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,008
Oh. Well,
I'm sure I would've been.

850
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:25,635
The real Sidney.
The real person.

851
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:28,680
I wish...

852
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:32,934
I wish it would've worked out.

853
01:01:42,485 --> 01:01:45,989
Hey...

854
01:01:50,493 --> 01:01:53,997
Angelina?

855
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,263
Hello?

856
01:03:28,508 --> 01:03:30,260
<i>Close call.</i>

857
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,387
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

858
01:03:32,637 --> 01:03:36,224
<i>It occurred to me that I've never
snuck through your bedroom window.</i>

859
01:03:36,474 --> 01:03:39,519
<i>See what you do to me?</i>

860
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:42,522
<i>What have I done to you?</i>

861
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:44,941
<i>About the, uh, sex stuff?</i>

862
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:47,694
<i>You know, I'm not trying
to rush you at all.</i>

863
01:03:47,944 --> 01:03:52,991
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

864
01:05:14,072 --> 01:05:17,576
Dewey!

865
01:06:04,456 --> 01:06:08,209
Dewey!

866
01:06:11,379 --> 01:06:15,467
Sidney, I'm in here.

867
01:06:20,805 --> 01:06:23,308
Over here.

868
01:06:23,558 --> 01:06:28,146
Yes. Mother will protect you
from the bogeyman.

869
01:06:28,396 --> 01:06:32,442
Come into the bedroom.

870
01:06:32,692 --> 01:06:36,363
Hide in Mommy's bed.

871
01:06:38,365 --> 01:06:40,325
I lied, Sidney.

872
01:06:40,575 --> 01:06:42,118
I can't protect you at all.

873
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:46,289
You don't deserve to be protected!
You didn't protect me!

874
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:49,000
<i>We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slutbag whore...</i>

875
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:51,461
<i>who flashed her shit all over town
like she was Sharon Stone.</i>

876
01:06:51,711 --> 01:06:55,090
<i>'Cause let's face it, Sidney,
your mother was no Sharon Stone.</i>

877
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:58,093
<i>- Sidney's mother was fucking my father.
- Sid, where are you?</i>

878
01:06:58,343 --> 01:07:01,555
Dewey!
Dewey, help me!

879
01:07:01,805 --> 01:07:05,642
Sidney? Give Mommy a kiss
and we'll make up.

880
01:07:05,892 --> 01:07:08,895
- No!
- Sidney!

881
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,904
Sid!

882
01:07:18,154 --> 01:07:20,156
Sid, are you okay?
What happened?

883
01:07:20,407 --> 01:07:24,077
The killer's in the house, Dewey.
He's upstairs.

884
01:07:24,536 --> 01:07:28,832
- And my mother...
- Let's go, let's go.

885
01:07:29,165 --> 01:07:31,751
I heard her voice.
I saw her, Dewey.

886
01:07:32,002 --> 01:07:34,921
- Upstairs. Come on, let's go.
- It's okay, Sid.

887
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:37,299
You weren't supposed
to go in that house.

888
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:39,467
It's all set up for the murder scene.

889
01:07:39,718 --> 01:07:41,553
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
- He was in there, Dewey.

890
01:07:41,803 --> 01:07:46,349
- He was in there, I swear, I swear.
- You know I believe you.

891
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:50,645
- What happened?
- Kincaid, hey.

892
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:54,149
There's nobody up here.

893
01:07:58,153 --> 01:08:01,907
Come on.

894
01:08:02,741 --> 01:08:05,368
- Come on.
- Okay, so I stole the mask.

895
01:08:05,619 --> 01:08:08,830
Whatever. I didn't know you got
the gas chamber for that.

896
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,666
- You stole the mask?
- I took it.

897
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:15,045
- You took the mask
or you stole the mask?
- I-I took it as like a souvenir.

898
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:17,714
- Don't look at me. I didn't take shit.
- I know he was there.

899
01:08:17,964 --> 01:08:19,883
I am not dreaming,
I am not crazy.

900
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:23,345
- He was there in Woodsboro.
- That's not Woodsboro, Sidney.

901
01:08:23,595 --> 01:08:28,183
You know what I mean. But he was there.
He or she, or whoever this is.

902
01:08:28,433 --> 01:08:30,977
We're gonna take you back
to the station, keep you under watch.

903
01:08:31,228 --> 01:08:33,563
Put you in a safe house.
Whatever it takes.

904
01:08:33,813 --> 01:08:37,317
Come on.

905
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:40,028
It's all right, Sid.
We all believe you.

906
01:08:40,278 --> 01:08:43,949
- He's watching.
- And he wants you.

907
01:08:46,868 --> 01:08:48,662
- Hey, Dew.
- Dew.
- Come on.

908
01:08:48,912 --> 01:08:51,539
- We have to go catch up with Sid.
- Take a look at this first.

909
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:53,708
- Someone we know?
- Where'd you get this?

910
01:08:53,959 --> 01:08:57,337
- We got it. Archives.
- Sidney's mother was an actress.
Three movies.

911
01:08:57,587 --> 01:09:02,133
- Horror movies.
- Wanna know who produced all three?
- Who?

912
01:09:02,384 --> 01:09:04,261
- There'll be other movies, Roman.
- Not only did they...

913
01:09:04,511 --> 01:09:07,472
did they kill the film,
but they killed my cast.

914
01:09:07,722 --> 01:09:10,809
Now, nobody's gonna wanna work
with me. Variety called me a pariah.

915
01:09:11,059 --> 01:09:14,563
I don't even know what a pariah is.
Why-Why couldn't someone
have killed the cast from Stab 1?

916
01:09:14,813 --> 01:09:17,190
Huh? Or Stab 2? Why me?
What... John, what did we do wrong?

917
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,734
Hollywood is full of criminals
whose careers are flourishing.

918
01:09:19,985 --> 01:09:22,195
I'm not a criminal!
I was questioned.

919
01:09:22,445 --> 01:09:24,281
Yeah, but that's all.
I was questioned. That's it.

920
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:27,367
- That's good for your mystique.
- You think it will help me get work?

921
01:09:27,617 --> 01:09:29,578
Roman. John.

922
01:09:29,828 --> 01:09:32,747
Jennifer, and guests.
To what do I owe the honour?

923
01:09:32,998 --> 01:09:36,793
- Rina Reynolds.
- Rina Reynolds? Who's Rina Reynolds?

924
01:09:37,043 --> 01:09:40,505
Why don't you head to the house?
Tell everybody not to cut
the cake without me.

925
01:09:40,755 --> 01:09:43,049
- Oh, God, I forgot. Your birthday.
- Yeah.

926
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,052
- Happy birthday, Roman.
- Yeah, as if life isn't tragic enough.

927
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:51,016
Shut the doors behind you, please.

928
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:54,227
So, you knew
Sidney Prescott's mother.

929
01:09:54,477 --> 01:09:57,689
- Who?
- Rina Reynolds?

930
01:09:57,939 --> 01:10:01,109
Do you know how many actors have
worked for me? Hundreds. Thousands.

931
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:04,654
- He didn't say she was an actor.
- Good catch.

932
01:10:04,905 --> 01:10:07,157
- So what's the point?
- Uh, no point.

933
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:10,201
I'm just gonna give, uh,
Detective Kincaid a call.

934
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:14,205
I remember. She was a bit player
in a couple of my movies.

935
01:10:14,456 --> 01:10:16,875
- A nobody. So what does it matter?
- Oh, come on.

936
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:20,670
You have made millions
off the story of her murder.

937
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:23,757
You're obsessed with her,
and you're obsessed with her daughter!

938
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:27,135
All right, easy, Geraldo.
Why don't you tell us the truth?

939
01:10:27,385 --> 01:10:31,389
What the hell are you guys getting at?
I make horror films, that's what I do.

940
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,642
The studio came to me with Stab.

941
01:10:33,892 --> 01:10:36,603
They came to me.
Check it out.

942
01:10:36,853 --> 01:10:39,481
- But you knew who she was.
- When we did the first Stab...

943
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:41,942
I realized I had known
Maureen Prescott before.

944
01:10:42,192 --> 01:10:44,486
I mean, as Rina.

945
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:48,490
I couldn't tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?

946
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:51,076
And now?
I mean, murders on your set.

947
01:10:51,326 --> 01:10:53,662
- And-And still you say nothing?
- Get real.

948
01:10:53,912 --> 01:10:56,289
- That would make me a suspect.
- Just because you knew her?

949
01:10:56,539 --> 01:10:58,833
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

950
01:10:59,084 --> 01:11:02,837
Just what did happen to Maureen
when she was in Hollywood?

951
01:11:03,588 --> 01:11:06,174
Now, you listen to me, Lois Lane.
Let it go. It's dead and buried.

952
01:11:06,424 --> 01:11:09,636
How would you like to see it
dug up on national TV?

953
01:11:09,886 --> 01:11:13,390
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

954
01:11:14,599 --> 01:11:17,811
It was in the '70s.
Everything was different.

955
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:21,773
I was well-known for my parties.
Rina knew what they were.

956
01:11:22,023 --> 01:11:26,361
It was for girls like her to meet men.
Men who could get them parts...

957
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:28,446
if they made
the right impression.

958
01:11:28,697 --> 01:11:30,865
Nothing happened to her
that she didn't invite...

959
01:11:31,116 --> 01:11:34,327
in one way or another
no matter what she said afterwards.

960
01:11:34,578 --> 01:11:37,747
- Are you saying she...
- I'm saying things got out of hand.

961
01:11:37,998 --> 01:11:41,877
Maybe they did take advantage of her.
You know, Maybe the sad truth is...

962
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:45,672
this is not the city
for innocents.

963
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:48,842
No charges were brought.
And the bottom line is...

964
01:11:49,092 --> 01:11:51,636
Rina Reynolds
wouldn't play by the rules.

965
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:54,055
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood?

966
01:11:54,306 --> 01:11:59,185
You gotta play the game, or go home.

967
01:12:03,773 --> 01:12:06,318
What do you know
about trilogies?

968
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:09,946
- You mean, like movie trilogies?
- You seem to like movies, Detective.

969
01:12:10,196 --> 01:12:14,534
Call me Mark, would you? 'Cause
I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.

970
01:12:14,784 --> 01:12:18,622
I'll call you Mark when
you catch the killer, Detective.

971
01:12:19,372 --> 01:12:23,418
All I know about movie trilogies
is that in the third one...

972
01:12:23,668 --> 01:12:27,505
all bets are off.

973
01:12:27,547 --> 01:12:29,549
- Did you request this case?
- No. They tend to put me...

974
01:12:29,799 --> 01:12:31,635
on the ones that deal
with the business.

975
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:34,971
I grew up here,
and I know my way around the studios.

976
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:37,432
Huh.

977
01:12:37,682 --> 01:12:41,061
Must be exciting.
Beautiful place, beautiful people.

978
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:45,065
To me, Hollywood is about death.

979
01:12:45,565 --> 01:12:48,109
Excuse me?

980
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,696
I'm a homicide detective, remember?

981
01:12:51,947 --> 01:12:54,658
And when you see what I see
day in and day out...

982
01:12:54,908 --> 01:12:57,327
the violence
that people do to each other...

983
01:12:57,577 --> 01:12:59,412
you get haunted.

984
01:12:59,663 --> 01:13:03,166
I think you know about that.

985
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:06,127
What do you mean?

986
01:13:06,378 --> 01:13:09,381
I know what it's like
to see ghosts that don't go away.

987
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:14,928
To be watching a scary movie in
your head, whether you want to or not.

988
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:20,016
Watching it alone.

989
01:13:20,892 --> 01:13:23,395
Ghosts are tough.
You can't shoot ghosts.

990
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:26,439
Can't arrest ghosts.

991
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:30,110
But the best way to stop being
haunted is to be with people.

992
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,279
You're here, you're not hiding.

993
01:13:32,529 --> 01:13:37,492
You've done the right thing,
Miss Prescott.

994
01:13:40,495 --> 01:13:44,332
What did you know about your mother?

995
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,005
I always thought
I had the perfect mom.

996
01:13:50,255 --> 01:13:53,758
Perfect family.

997
01:13:54,718 --> 01:13:59,764
Till I found out I was wrong.
She, um...

998
01:14:01,057 --> 01:14:06,021
She had a secret life, and I tried
to understand that, and, um...

999
01:14:06,271 --> 01:14:11,943
soon as I thought that I had,
more secrets.

1000
01:14:14,112 --> 01:14:17,032
I don't know who my mom was.

1001
01:14:17,282 --> 01:14:21,119
You know who she was to you.

1002
01:14:24,164 --> 01:14:26,124
Here's the deal.
I'm off to search the set.

1003
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:30,503
I think what you saw is real.
That's the good news.

1004
01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:32,839
- How is that good news?
- Because that means...

1005
01:14:33,089 --> 01:14:36,051
that we're dealing with
an ordinary flesh-and-blood killer.

1006
01:14:36,301 --> 01:14:39,721
- And I know how
to handle guys like that.
- Oh, yeah? How?

1007
01:14:39,971 --> 01:14:44,434
Catch him or kill him.

1008
01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:50,398
Hey, Detective.

1009
01:14:50,649 --> 01:14:54,653
What's your favourite
scary movie?

1010
01:14:56,947 --> 01:15:00,450
My life.

1011
01:15:01,952 --> 01:15:04,496
Mine too.

1012
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:07,123
We have to think.
Strategize.

1013
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:10,126
- Milton's the key to everything.
- He's a pervert, he's not a killer.

1014
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:13,088
He's gotta be involved somehow.
We should follow him.

1015
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:15,173
We're gonna go back to the precinct and
we're gonna tell Kincaid and Sidney...

1016
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:17,467
what we found out.

1017
01:15:17,717 --> 01:15:21,054
My Gale would be much more aggressive.
My Gale would suspect everybody.

1018
01:15:21,304 --> 01:15:25,058
- My Gale would...
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

1019
01:15:26,685 --> 01:15:29,229
<i>- Riley here.
- Dewey, it's Sidney.
- Hey, Sid.</i>

1020
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:31,398
<i>- I'm with Gale.
We're on our way to see you.
- No.</i>

1021
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:34,985
<i>Listen, I'm not at the station.
John Milton called me and said
he had something to tell me.</i>

1022
01:15:35,235 --> 01:15:37,529
<i>Something about my mom.
I'm going to meet him at his house.</i>

1023
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:39,948
Wait, Sid, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

1024
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:43,034
<i>It's okay. Kincaid's with me.
I've got official big-time...</i>

1025
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:46,538
<i>L.A.P.D. protection, but
I'd feel better if you were there.</i>

1026
01:15:46,788 --> 01:15:50,876
<i>- We're on our way, but still, Sid...
- Thanks.</i>

1027
01:15:51,126 --> 01:15:56,423
- What?
- Looks like we're going
to that party after all.

1028
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:08,560
Hey, guys. Come on in.
Join the party.

1029
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,687
Yeah, well, actually,
we're here to see Sidney.

1030
01:16:10,937 --> 01:16:12,981
- Really? Sidney's here.
- Where?

1031
01:16:13,231 --> 01:16:16,401
- Where's Sidney?
- She's right there!

1032
01:16:16,651 --> 01:16:19,946
Jesus!
Not "Sidney," Sidney.

1033
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:23,575
- Like I'm "Gale" and she's Gale.
- Sidney Prescott?

1034
01:16:23,825 --> 01:16:26,536
- Yeah.
- No, I'd never invite her here.

1035
01:16:26,786 --> 01:16:30,373
- She's on her way.
- Well, the more the merrier.

1036
01:16:30,624 --> 01:16:34,336
God, this house is incredible.

1037
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:37,464
- It's old Hollywood.
- Yeah. Could the dude have more money?

1038
01:16:37,714 --> 01:16:40,592
Supposedly, Milton has
a secret screening room...

1039
01:16:40,842 --> 01:16:42,677
that was like the scene
back in the '70s, you know.

1040
01:16:42,928 --> 01:16:47,057
It was, like, drinks and drugs
and girls and movies and shit.

1041
01:16:47,307 --> 01:16:49,976
Wow! Wish I could've seen it.

1042
01:16:50,227 --> 01:16:52,103
Big old screening room
shouldn't be too hard to find.

1043
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:54,189
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go check this place out.

1044
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:57,817
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one damn minute.
There's a psycho killer on the loose.

1045
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:00,528
And you want to go traipsing around
this gigantic mansion?

1046
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:03,114
Have you ever actually seen
the Stab movies? Every time...

1047
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:05,909
this dude enters a room,
he ends up a goddam shish kebab.

1048
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:09,162
- I'll go with you, Roman.
- There you go. You guys wanna come?

1049
01:17:09,412 --> 01:17:13,333
It'll be okay.
We're gonna stick together.

1050
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:17,087
- You're not stickin'. Wait up.
- We're gonna stay here and wait for Sid.

1051
01:17:17,337 --> 01:17:20,465
We'll be right back!

1052
01:17:20,715 --> 01:17:23,760
If-lf you were a screening room...

1053
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:27,514
where would you be?

1054
01:17:28,807 --> 01:17:32,310
I bet in the basement.

1055
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,524
I don't like basements.

1056
01:17:39,943 --> 01:17:43,446
Ooh, it's spooky.

1057
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,543
- Ooh, Weredad.
- Damn, it's dark in here.

1058
01:17:56,793 --> 01:17:59,337
- I loved that movie.
- Forget the movie!
What if Milton's crazy...

1059
01:17:59,588 --> 01:18:02,090
and he's gonna jump outta his screening
room with a sling blade or something?

1060
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:05,844
- He won't.
- You sure about that?

1061
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:13,643
- What's down there?
- Zombies and aliens.

1062
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:16,313
You know, what you look like
without make-up, Jennifer.

1063
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:19,691
Jesus. Stop pretending
I wasn't the best you've ever had.

1064
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:25,530
- Oh, stop pretending I even remember.
- Stop pretending!

1065
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,621
Roman?

1066
01:18:43,089 --> 01:18:46,593
Roman?

1067
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:53,308
- Any sign of her?
- No.

1068
01:18:53,558 --> 01:18:55,810
This is so strange.

1069
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:57,896
It sure is.

1070
01:18:58,146 --> 01:19:00,148
Dewey, do you have caller I.D.
On your cell phone?

1071
01:19:00,398 --> 01:19:04,069
- Yeah.
- All right, use it and-and press "send."

1072
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:16,414
What the hell?

1073
01:19:26,466 --> 01:19:30,470
What is this thing?

1074
01:19:31,096 --> 01:19:35,267
Is this what he...
What the hell?

1075
01:19:36,851 --> 01:19:39,145
Dewey, he's got our voices.

1076
01:19:39,396 --> 01:19:41,231
He's got Sid.

1077
01:19:41,481 --> 01:19:43,316
He's got us all.

1078
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:47,279
- Oh, my God. We gotta find her.
- Come on.

1079
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:49,906
All right, take the gun.

1080
01:19:50,156 --> 01:19:52,367
Go find Roman and Jennifer.
I'm gonna get the others.

1081
01:19:52,617 --> 01:19:56,121
- Be careful.
- You too.

1082
01:19:57,289 --> 01:20:03,044
Tyson! Angelina!
You up there?

1083
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,715
- Roman!
- Tyson!

1084
01:20:06,965 --> 01:20:09,175
Angelina!

1085
01:20:09,426 --> 01:20:12,304
Damn it!

1086
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:14,472
Okay, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1087
01:20:14,723 --> 01:20:16,808
- Where's Angelina?
- I don't know. She went in here.

1088
01:20:17,058 --> 01:20:19,102
- I came in after her. Now she's gone.
- Great.

1089
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:24,149
- What's wrong?
- Looks like Stab 3
is back in production.

1090
01:20:25,775 --> 01:20:29,070
Roman!

1091
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:33,408
Jennifer!

1092
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:47,505
Jennifer!

1093
01:20:51,259 --> 01:20:54,262
Roman!

1094
01:20:54,512 --> 01:20:58,016
Jennifer!

1095
01:21:05,023 --> 01:21:09,486
Roman?

1096
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:26,127
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.

1097
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:30,423
Dewey! Dewey!

1098
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:36,805
Dewey?

1099
01:21:37,055 --> 01:21:39,558
Dewey!

1100
01:21:39,766 --> 01:21:41,977
God, I'm sorry.
Jennifer, Gale, look.

1101
01:21:42,227 --> 01:21:44,729
- I found a secret passage.
- Roman's dead.

1102
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,399
- What?
- The killer's here.
- What?
- Come on.

1103
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:51,152
- Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
- You're not safe alone!

1104
01:21:51,403 --> 01:21:53,238
Listen to me!

1105
01:21:53,488 --> 01:21:57,534
I did not fuck that pig Milton
to get a leading role...

1106
01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:03,248
just to die here with second-rate
celebrities like you two!

1107
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:08,420
- Gale! I'm up here.
- Come on.

1108
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:12,090
- Dewey!
- You guys should get out too.

1109
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:16,303
It's crazy to still be here.

1110
01:22:21,516 --> 01:22:26,104
- Wait!
- Come on!

1111
01:22:40,619 --> 01:22:43,538
- Dewey!
- Gale, Jennifer, up here!

1112
01:22:43,788 --> 01:22:46,499
Dewey, here.
He got Roman and Angelina too.

1113
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:50,545
- We'll be safer if we
stick together, won't we?
- Of course. Why...

1114
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:54,466
What's goin' on?
Oh, shit!

1115
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:58,053
- Hey!
- Dewey!

1116
01:22:58,136 --> 01:23:01,056
Dewey!

1117
01:23:01,306 --> 01:23:04,726
No!

1118
01:23:13,401 --> 01:23:16,655
Help! Police!
Help! Help!

1119
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:21,076
Police! Help!

1120
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:31,294
Oh, you motherfucker!

1121
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:11,793
Damn!

1122
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:19,467
Dewey! Dewey!

1123
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,891
Behind the mirror, Dewey!

1124
01:24:26,641 --> 01:24:28,977
Gale! Get away! Dewey!

1125
01:24:29,227 --> 01:24:31,396
- Do you hear something?
- Get away from me, you asshole.

1126
01:24:31,646 --> 01:24:36,318
- Get away from me! You don't scare me!
- Look, Gale. The mirror's moving.

1127
01:24:36,568 --> 01:24:39,905
- Gale! Gale!
- Stand back, Gale.

1128
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:43,283
You can't kill me. I'm the killer
in Stab 3. I'm the killer!

1129
01:24:43,575 --> 01:24:47,829
Gale, cover!

1130
01:24:48,413 --> 01:24:52,000
Dewey!

1131
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:03,595
- Tyson!
- Tyson!

1132
01:25:03,845 --> 01:25:05,680
I'm gonna check down here.
You call for help.

1133
01:25:05,931 --> 01:25:08,099
Okay.

1134
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:11,436
Tyson!

1135
01:25:11,686 --> 01:25:15,148
- Tyson?
- Any sign of him?

1136
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:19,027
- No.
- All right. I'm gonna check out front.

1137
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:28,203
Dew...

1138
01:25:51,977 --> 01:25:55,480
Gale!

1139
01:25:56,398 --> 01:26:00,318
Gale!

1140
01:26:00,944 --> 01:26:03,321
Gale!

1141
01:26:03,572 --> 01:26:07,576
- Dewey?
- Gale!

1142
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:12,455
Gale!

1143
01:26:16,042 --> 01:26:18,503
<i>- Who is this?
- Dewey, it's me.</i>

1144
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:21,673
Gale, where are you?

1145
01:26:21,882 --> 01:26:24,259
<i>I'm in the basement.
I'm trapped.</i>

1146
01:26:24,509 --> 01:26:28,263
<i>- Where?
- There's a door in the kitchen.</i>

1147
01:26:29,347 --> 01:26:32,934
<i>Hurry.</i>

1148
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:39,024
Wait. How do I know this is
you, Gale, and not the killer?

1149
01:26:39,274 --> 01:26:42,652
<i>Dewey, open the fucking door.
It's me.</i>

1150
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:45,530
Well, don't you think that's
what the killer would say?

1151
01:26:45,822 --> 01:26:52,204
<i>Come on. He's out cold
at the bottom of the stairs.</i>

1152
01:26:52,954 --> 01:26:56,625
Hey!

1153
01:27:08,053 --> 01:27:12,140
Dewey. Dewey.

1154
01:27:21,274 --> 01:27:23,151
All right, all right.
It's pizza, not a party.

1155
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:27,822
Everybody get back to work.
Anybody seen my fuckin' partner?

1156
01:27:28,031 --> 01:27:31,576
Hey, Morgan,
what did you pay?

1157
01:28:19,457 --> 01:28:22,627
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

1158
01:28:22,836 --> 01:28:25,297
<i>- Who is this?
- Who is this?</i>

1159
01:28:25,547 --> 01:28:30,594
<i>- Um, w-who's calling?
- Um, w-who's calling?</i>

1160
01:28:30,886 --> 01:28:36,141
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back.
I can only hear myself.

1161
01:28:36,349 --> 01:28:40,896
<i>I only hear you too, Sidney.</i>

1162
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:44,399
<i>- Who is this?
- The question isn't who I am.</i>

1163
01:28:44,649 --> 01:28:48,320
<i>The question is:
Who's with me?</i>

1164
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:50,405
<i>- Sidney, stay away!
- Sidney!</i>

1165
01:28:50,655 --> 01:28:54,034
<i>Don't do it. If you do one thing
to attract attention to yourself...</i>

1166
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,912
<i>one thing,
I'll kill them both.</i>

1167
01:28:57,204 --> 01:29:02,667
<i>Now, do you have somewhere
we can be alone?</i>

1168
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:07,172
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah. Go there.</i>

1169
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:15,180
<i>Oh, it's hard being friends
with you, Sidney.</i>

1170
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:18,350
<i>When you're friends with Sidney,
you die.</i>

1171
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,938
<i>Well, these friends don't have to,
Sidney. It's up to you.</i>

1172
01:29:23,188 --> 01:29:25,106
<i>- How do I know their voices are...
- Are real?</i>

1173
01:29:25,357 --> 01:29:27,275
<i>How do you know
you're not hearing things?</i>

1174
01:29:27,484 --> 01:29:32,656
<i>How do you know I'm not someone
in your head? Somewhere you know.</i>

1175
01:29:32,864 --> 01:29:35,242
<i>- Don't come here, Sidney!
- Dewey!</i>

1176
01:29:35,533 --> 01:29:38,620
<i>- Or do you?
- You're dead.</i>

1177
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:41,122
<i>I don't want them.
I want you.</i>

1178
01:29:41,373 --> 01:29:43,959
<i>It's simple.
You show yourself, they survive.</i>

1179
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:46,545
<i>- You run, they die.
- Oh, God!</i>

1180
01:29:46,795 --> 01:29:50,715
<i>Don't you wanna know, Sidney,
who killed her?</i>

1181
01:29:50,924 --> 01:29:54,302
<i>Don't you wanna know
who killed your mother?</i>

1182
01:29:54,553 --> 01:29:56,388
- Have you seen Kincaid?
- Yeah, I saw him go out.

1183
01:29:56,638 --> 01:29:58,306
- Wallace is still lookin' for him.
- Where?

1184
01:29:58,557 --> 01:30:02,477
<i>She'd have been so happy, Sidney,
to know we'd be together.</i>

1185
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:08,066
<i>- Where?
- I'll call you when you're on your way.</i>

1186
01:30:10,485 --> 01:30:14,739
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1187
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:25,977
Holy shit.

1188
01:31:34,236 --> 01:31:36,488
<i>- What?
- You follow directions well, Sidney.</i>

1189
01:31:36,738 --> 01:31:38,823
<i>Now, welcome to the final act.</i>

1190
01:31:39,074 --> 01:31:41,660
<i>See that metal detector?</i>

1191
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:45,830
<i>Use it.</i>

1192
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:53,171
<i>All over, Sidney.
Everywhere.</i>

1193
01:31:56,341 --> 01:32:01,680
<i>Everywhere.
The other leg too.</i>

1194
01:32:04,432 --> 01:32:08,103
<i>Show it to me.</i>

1195
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:15,694
<i>Throw it in the pool.</i>

1196
01:32:17,362 --> 01:32:19,197
<i>Now, come inside, Sidney.</i>

1197
01:32:19,447 --> 01:32:22,284
No fucking way. How do I know
they're not dead already?

1198
01:32:22,534 --> 01:32:25,704
<i>They're right inside,
waiting for you.</i>

1199
01:32:25,954 --> 01:32:29,457
<i>Look for yourself.</i>

1200
01:32:39,551 --> 01:32:44,556
<i>Now that we're all here,
the party can begin.</i>

1201
01:32:44,806 --> 01:32:48,059
- Dewey.
- Sid.

1202
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:51,229
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1203
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:55,400
He's right there!

1204
01:32:59,988 --> 01:33:02,574
Oh, shit.

1205
01:33:02,824 --> 01:33:04,492
Think again.

1206
01:33:04,743 --> 01:33:08,663
It's your turn to scream, asshole.

1207
01:33:10,582 --> 01:33:14,920
Yeah!

1208
01:33:18,006 --> 01:33:21,343
- It's okay. Just give me a second.
- Okay.

1209
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:26,681
- Hurry, Sid.
- Sidney? Sidney?

1210
01:33:27,933 --> 01:33:31,853
Where is he?

1211
01:33:33,605 --> 01:33:37,192
Be careful!

1212
01:33:42,948 --> 01:33:46,368
I heard shots. Tyson's dead.
What's goin' on?

1213
01:33:46,618 --> 01:33:49,120
- What're you doin' here, Kincaid?
- Lookin' for you.

1214
01:33:49,371 --> 01:33:52,374
Tyson said there was a party here
tonight, and I thought, uh-oh.

1215
01:33:52,624 --> 01:33:54,543
Third act celebration.
Thought I better check it out.

1216
01:33:54,793 --> 01:33:58,713
Alone?
Where's your partner?

1217
01:34:01,132 --> 01:34:03,885
Hey, Miss Prescott.

1218
01:34:04,135 --> 01:34:08,890
I'm here to help.
Put the gun down.

1219
01:34:09,808 --> 01:34:13,228
Put the gun down.

1220
01:34:15,981 --> 01:34:20,068
No!

1221
01:34:23,572 --> 01:34:27,993
Sid! Wake up, Sid!
Sid, come on!

1222
01:34:28,243 --> 01:34:32,163
- Wake up!
- Sidney!

1223
01:34:32,414 --> 01:34:34,666
Sid, shoot him! Sid!

1224
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:38,670
Shoot the fucker!

1225
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:43,258
Shoot him!

1226
01:34:46,428 --> 01:34:49,431
You want me, motherfucker?
Come and get me.

1227
01:34:49,681 --> 01:34:53,935
Run!

1228
01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:43,401
Sid.

1229
01:35:43,652 --> 01:35:47,072
Sid.

1230
01:35:47,322 --> 01:35:52,911
Come in here, please.

1231
01:35:53,745 --> 01:35:57,749
It's just me, Sid.

1232
01:35:57,999 --> 01:36:01,670
Oh, I was so pretty.

1233
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,173
Everybody loved me.

1234
01:36:05,423 --> 01:36:09,928
Have you missed me, Sidney?

1235
01:36:10,512 --> 01:36:16,184
Would you like to hold me
one last time?

1236
01:36:16,518 --> 01:36:19,271
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?

1237
01:36:19,521 --> 01:36:25,527
Don't you remember your mother?

1238
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:37,372
You're not going anywhere, Sidney.

1239
01:36:37,622 --> 01:36:43,461
It's time you came to terms
with me and with Mother.

1240
01:36:44,462 --> 01:36:47,215
Maybe you never
knew her at all, Sidney.

1241
01:36:47,465 --> 01:36:52,387
Maybe you just can't get past
the surface of things.

1242
01:36:52,637 --> 01:36:56,308
- Who the hell are you?
- The other half of you.

1243
01:36:56,558 --> 01:37:00,478
I searched for a mother too,
an actress named Rina Reynolds.

1244
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:02,647
Tried to find her my whole life.

1245
01:37:02,898 --> 01:37:05,650
And four years ago,
I actually tracked her down.

1246
01:37:05,901 --> 01:37:09,070
Knocked at her door, thinking
she'd welcome me with open arms.

1247
01:37:09,321 --> 01:37:13,658
But she had a new life
and a new name: Maureen Prescott.

1248
01:37:13,909 --> 01:37:15,827
You were the only child
she claimed, Sidney.

1249
01:37:16,077 --> 01:37:18,914
She shut me out
in the cold forever.

1250
01:37:19,164 --> 01:37:23,251
Her own son.

1251
01:37:27,505 --> 01:37:32,344
Roman Bridger, director.
And brother.

1252
01:37:32,594 --> 01:37:35,180
She slammed the door in my face, Sid.
She said I was Rina's child...

1253
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:37,515
and Rina was dead.

1254
01:37:37,766 --> 01:37:39,684
And it struck me.

1255
01:37:39,935 --> 01:37:43,104
What a good idea!
So I watched her.

1256
01:37:43,355 --> 01:37:47,192
I made a little home movie.
A little-little family film.

1257
01:37:47,442 --> 01:37:50,362
It seems Maureen...
Mom...

1258
01:37:50,612 --> 01:37:54,616
She really got around.
I mean, Cotton was one thing.

1259
01:37:54,866 --> 01:37:56,868
Everybody knew about that.

1260
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,706
But Billy's father?
That was the key.

1261
01:38:01,957 --> 01:38:03,875
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing
his daddy in my film too much.

1262
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:06,294
He didn't like it at all.

1263
01:38:06,545 --> 01:38:10,632
But once I supplied the motivation,
all the kid needed was a few pointers.

1264
01:38:10,882 --> 01:38:14,135
Have a partner to sell out in case
you get caught, find someone to frame.

1265
01:38:14,386 --> 01:38:16,638
It was like
he was making a movie.

1266
01:38:16,888 --> 01:38:21,393
You. This is all because ofyou.

1267
01:38:21,643 --> 01:38:25,063
I'm a director, Sid.

1268
01:38:25,313 --> 01:38:27,566
- I direct.
- Oh.

1269
01:38:27,816 --> 01:38:32,737
I had no idea that they were
gonna make a film of their own.

1270
01:38:33,572 --> 01:38:37,242
- Oh, shit.
- What a film it turned out to be, huh?

1271
01:38:37,492 --> 01:38:40,328
I mean, introducing Sidney,
the victim.

1272
01:38:40,579 --> 01:38:45,500
Sidney, the survivor.
Sidney, the star!

1273
01:38:59,848 --> 01:39:01,933
All right. You're gonna be all right.
Just apply pressure.

1274
01:39:02,183 --> 01:39:04,436
Here, take this.
Get the son ofa bitch.

1275
01:39:04,686 --> 01:39:06,187
Let's go.

1276
01:39:06,438 --> 01:39:09,274
Fine, you got what you wanted,
hero and villain face-to-face.

1277
01:39:09,524 --> 01:39:12,193
- Well, you know what happens now?
The villain dies!
- Exactly!

1278
01:39:12,444 --> 01:39:16,698
But I'm not the villain, Sid.
You are.

1279
01:39:16,948 --> 01:39:21,369
Here he is, the man who gave away
your mother's innocence.

1280
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:23,955
Huh? What he did
to her made her a slut.

1281
01:39:24,206 --> 01:39:28,376
Didn't it? Huh? She never recovered from
that night, right here in this room.

1282
01:39:28,627 --> 01:39:32,130
They fucked her three ways from Sunday.
Ruined her life.

1283
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,049
Ruined yours too,
didn't it, Sid?

1284
01:39:34,299 --> 01:39:36,635
You hate him, Sid?

1285
01:39:36,885 --> 01:39:42,474
Come on, I know you do.
I'm sure you do.

1286
01:39:42,724 --> 01:39:45,060
<i>I know who you are.
I know what happened to my mother.</i>

1287
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:48,063
<i>And I want you to understand,
I'm gonna make you pay!</i>

1288
01:39:48,313 --> 01:39:50,148
That's what the police are gonna
find on Milton's answering machine...

1289
01:39:50,398 --> 01:39:53,985
right next to his lifeless,
mutilated corpse.

1290
01:39:54,236 --> 01:39:56,321
- What? Can't hear ya.
- You don't have to do this, Roman.

1291
01:39:56,571 --> 01:39:58,490
Just tell me what you want.
I can make it happen.

1292
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:00,659
Any picture.
Name your budget. Script approval.

1293
01:40:00,909 --> 01:40:02,994
- Final cut!
- I already have it.

1294
01:40:03,245 --> 01:40:06,581
No!

1295
01:40:07,249 --> 01:40:09,084
God! You spineless bastard!

1296
01:40:09,334 --> 01:40:12,170
No, Sid, that would be you.
You did it all.

1297
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:16,341
You did it, you called them all.
Even your closest friends.

1298
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:19,010
Living in total isolation, the pressure
ofanother movie about you...

1299
01:40:19,261 --> 01:40:22,264
the discovery that Milton
destroyed Mommy dearest...

1300
01:40:22,514 --> 01:40:25,600
you finally just snapped!

1301
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:30,188
One, two, three!

1302
01:40:31,273 --> 01:40:34,943
And who's our hero, huh?
The sole survivor. Who's the one...

1303
01:40:35,193 --> 01:40:38,947
who bravely faced down the psychopath
and killed her with her own knife?

1304
01:40:39,197 --> 01:40:41,449
You're gonna pay for the life
you stole from me, Sid.

1305
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:45,370
For the mother, and for the family,
and for the stardom and...

1306
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,789
Goddam it! Everything you have
that should've been mine!

1307
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:51,042
God! Why don't you stop your whining
and get on with it?
I've heard this shit before!

1308
01:40:51,293 --> 01:40:53,461
- Stop!
- You know why you kill people,
Roman? Do you?

1309
01:40:53,712 --> 01:40:56,715
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Because you choose to!
There is no one else to blame!

1310
01:40:56,965 --> 01:41:00,135
- Stop it! Fucking damn it!
- Why don't you take
some fucking responsibility?

1311
01:41:00,385 --> 01:41:04,222
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1312
01:41:15,984 --> 01:41:19,487
Sid? Sidney?

1313
01:41:26,995 --> 01:41:30,498
Sidney?

1314
01:41:37,505 --> 01:41:40,592
Sidney!

1315
01:41:53,271 --> 01:41:56,191
Sidney!

1316
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,446
Leave her alone!

1317
01:42:11,289 --> 01:42:14,459
Dewey, do something!

1318
01:42:17,462 --> 01:42:22,050
- Stand back!
- Dewey!

1319
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:29,057
Sid! Sid.

1320
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:56,251
Sid?

1321
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:02,424
Where is he?

1322
01:43:15,186 --> 01:43:18,440
Hey. Lose something?

1323
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:22,027
Found something.

1324
01:43:43,465 --> 01:43:48,053
There's gotta be another way in there!
Come on!

1325
01:43:52,891 --> 01:43:57,646
You hurt her,
I swear I'll kill you!

1326
01:44:10,242 --> 01:44:14,496
- Dewey!
- Down this way. There's another hallway.

1327
01:44:25,257 --> 01:44:28,760
There's another door down here.

1328
01:44:34,516 --> 01:44:36,768
- This thing's not budging.
- Look around for something heavy.

1329
01:44:37,018 --> 01:44:41,189
- Go that way.
- Okay!

1330
01:45:05,797 --> 01:45:09,467
I shot you.

1331
01:45:13,138 --> 01:45:17,809
I guess we think alike.

1332
01:45:17,809 --> 01:45:20,562
Mother's dead.

1333
01:45:20,812 --> 01:45:24,316
And there is nothing
you can do about that.

1334
01:45:24,482 --> 01:45:27,652
I still got
to make my movie.

1335
01:45:27,903 --> 01:45:31,907
Stab 3, right?

1336
01:45:48,089 --> 01:45:52,010
Kincaid, hang in there.

1337
01:45:52,177 --> 01:45:57,349
Roman? It was Roman?

1338
01:46:20,705 --> 01:46:25,961
Be careful, Sid. Randy said
the killer's always superhuman.

1339
01:46:27,295 --> 01:46:31,132
Yeah, well,
he wasn't superhuman, Dewey.

1340
01:46:31,383 --> 01:46:35,136
He wasn't superhuman at all.

1341
01:46:39,224 --> 01:46:41,226
- You can't fuckin' kill me!
- Head!

1342
01:46:41,476 --> 01:46:43,728
- Head! Head, Dewey!
- What?

1343
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:47,649
Head!
Shoot him in the head.

1344
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,162
Thanks.

1345
01:47:01,413 --> 01:47:04,916
No problem.

1346
01:47:30,025 --> 01:47:32,360
Look.

1347
01:47:32,611 --> 01:47:34,779
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

1348
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:39,701
- Yeah, she's doin' great.
- Yeah.

1349
01:47:43,371 --> 01:47:46,875
Look.

1350
01:47:47,209 --> 01:47:49,127
What are you doing with that?

1351
01:47:49,377 --> 01:47:53,131
Um, will you sign it
for me, Gale?

1352
01:47:53,381 --> 01:47:55,634
You hate that book.

1353
01:47:55,884 --> 01:47:58,970
Besides, I'm-I'm done
with that kind of reporting.

1354
01:47:59,221 --> 01:48:04,643
For me.
Will you sign it for me?

1355
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:08,730
You're a nut.

1356
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:12,067
Okay.

1357
01:48:20,742 --> 01:48:25,080
- Will you?
- Dewey.

1358
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:28,833
I know it'll never work,
and you know it'll never work.

1359
01:48:29,084 --> 01:48:36,341
But what I'm asking is
just to see ifwe're wrong.

1360
01:48:36,675 --> 01:48:40,595
We don't know everything, Gale.

1361
01:48:41,513 --> 01:48:46,351
I mean, you thinkyou do, but...

1362
01:48:52,274 --> 01:48:55,861
You're a brave man,
Dewey Riley.

1363
01:48:56,278 --> 01:49:00,448
I'm really scared right now.

1364
01:49:43,241 --> 01:49:46,828
Inside.

1365
01:49:51,249 --> 01:49:54,419
Sid, we've been waiting for you.
We're gonna start a movie.

1366
01:49:54,669 --> 01:50:01,009
- What kind of movie?
- You have to come and see.

1367
01:50:29,287 --> 01:50:32,958
<i>Take a little walk
to the edge of town</i>

1368
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:36,962
<i>Now, spread your wings and fly</i>

1369
01:50:37,212 --> 01:50:41,216
<i>Don't the lights of the city
look so damn pretty</i>

1370
01:50:41,466 --> 01:50:45,637
<i>When you're flyin' so high</i>

1371
01:50:45,887 --> 01:50:49,391
<i>It's hard to know
about there down below</i>

1372
01:50:49,641 --> 01:50:54,563
<i>The streets fade
They're swimmin'deep in blood</i>

1373
01:50:54,813 --> 01:51:01,736
<i>It seems to make me
groan and cry</i>

1374
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,657
<i>You really wanna know
what's wrong with this land</i>

1375
01:51:05,907 --> 01:51:11,580
<i>Just scratch your head
with your red right hand</i>

1376
01:51:13,164 --> 01:51:17,669
<i>I'm talkin'about blood, babe</i>

1377
01:51:17,919 --> 01:51:21,840
<i>It's in your veins</i>

1378
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:25,677
<i>Your mommy and daddy</i>

1379
01:51:25,927 --> 01:51:29,598
<i>They've got the same</i>

1380
01:51:31,182 --> 01:51:36,021
<i>You're under the mirror
day after day</i>

1381
01:51:36,271 --> 01:51:40,025
<i>You see a pretty face
crumblin' away</i>

1382
01:51:40,275 --> 01:51:47,282
<i>As you become
your mom and daddy</i>

1383
01:51:47,449 --> 01:51:51,953
<i>Scream once, scream twice
Now scream again</i>

1384
01:51:52,204 --> 01:51:58,210
<i>Cover that face
with your red right hand</i>

1385
01:52:10,138 --> 01:52:14,726
<i>So, is this the end</i>

1386
01:52:14,976 --> 01:52:19,731
<i>Forus, my friend</i>

1387
01:52:23,151 --> 01:52:27,489
<i>So, is this the end</i>

1388
01:52:27,739 --> 01:52:33,161
<i>Forus, my friend</i>

1389
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:40,252
<i>So, is this the end</i>

1390
01:52:40,502 --> 01:52:46,007
<i>Forus, my friend</i>

1391
01:53:02,857 --> 01:53:09,614
<i>Well as though we rise</i>

1392
01:53:09,865 --> 01:53:15,453
<i>As the day breaks the dawn</i>

1393
01:53:15,704 --> 01:53:22,460
<i>And as the moon hides the sun</i>

1394
01:53:22,711 --> 01:53:26,631
<i>Oh, the sun</i>

1395
01:53:28,383 --> 01:53:34,556
<i>No more sorrow</i>

1396
01:53:35,473 --> 01:53:41,146
<i>All those crying days are gone</i>

1397
01:53:41,396 --> 01:53:44,816
<i>No more sorrow</i>

1398
01:53:45,066 --> 01:53:47,819
<i>Now it'sgone</i>

1399
01:53:48,069 --> 01:53:51,072
<i>Now it'sgone</i>

1400
01:53:51,323 --> 01:53:55,493
<i>Now it'sgone</i>

1401
01:53:58,997 --> 01:54:03,668
<i>So, is this the end</i>

1402
01:54:03,919 --> 01:54:10,508
<i>Forus, my friend</i>

1403
01:54:13,595 --> 01:54:17,849
<i>Spoke to my god today
Asked him why he'd gone away</i>

1404
01:54:18,099 --> 01:54:22,187
<i>Hitched on a rocket ride
into the sun</i>

1405
01:54:22,437 --> 01:54:26,691
<i>Said, son I got one for ya
Down there in California</i>

1406
01:54:26,942 --> 01:54:31,029
<i>Just take a look around
at all you've done</i>

1407
01:54:31,279 --> 01:54:34,449
<i>You're automatic
like a burnin' gun</i>

1408
01:54:34,699 --> 01:54:39,788
<i>You're a star like everyone</i>

1409
01:54:40,121 --> 01:54:44,209
<i>Talked to my soul today
Couldn't keep my brain away</i>

1410
01:54:44,459 --> 01:54:48,547
<i>So I found a holiday
behind the sun</i>

1411
01:54:48,797 --> 01:54:53,051
<i>Took all the friends I could
Spun out in Hollywood</i>

1412
01:54:53,301 --> 01:54:57,472
<i>Hit up on a climate everyone</i>

1413
01:54:57,722 --> 01:55:00,809
<i>You're automatic
like a burnin' gun</i>

1414
01:55:01,059 --> 01:55:06,481
<i>You're a star like everyone</i>

1415
01:55:07,148 --> 01:55:11,236
<i>You could save the world</i>

1416
01:55:11,486 --> 01:55:15,907
<i>Could be shining on my pearl</i>

1417
01:55:16,157 --> 01:55:20,245
<i>You could save the world</i>

1418
01:55:20,495 --> 01:55:25,750
<i>Just might find your way
mypearl</i>

1419
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:29,421
<i>Shine</i>

1420
01:55:31,923 --> 01:55:35,677
<i>Shine</i>

1421
01:55:41,683 --> 01:55:44,769
<i>You're automatic
like a burnin' gun</i>

1422
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:50,859

1423
01:55:51,193 --> 01:55:55,280
<i>You could save the world</i>
