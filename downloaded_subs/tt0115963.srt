1
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,007
Now is the time.
This is the hour.

2
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,007
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.

3
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,008
Now is the time.
This is the hour.

4
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,008
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.

5
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,093
THE CRAFT

6
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,021
Move your seat
to the upright position, please.

7
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,023
Come on. Let's go.

8
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:32,024
Come on, darling.
The taxi's waiting.

9
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:29,032
Oh, yeah.
It's a lot drier in here, Dad.

10
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:31,033
Oh, God.
We need a new roof.

11
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:35,033
Yeah. But it's big.

12
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:38,034
I like the peg-and-groove floors.

13
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,034
Damask curtains
would look really nice.

14
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:46,035
-Yeah. Gotta get this roof fixed, honey.
-Yeah.

15
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,043
I found this out back.
You want it?

16
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:44,044
Relax. What's the matter with you?

17
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:46,044
- Dad!
- What? What is it?

18
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:52,045
What the--
Get the hell out of here!

19
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,046
What the hell?

20
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:56,046
Sarah, you all right?

21
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,046
Yeah, I am fine.
He just surprised me, that's all.

22
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:00,047
Yeah, I guess.

23
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,047
Are you sure?

24
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,047
Yeah, I am fine.

25
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:21,050
You could wait--
just until you got a school uniform.

26
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,050
You don't have to go now.

27
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,051
I can't stay home and watch daytime TV
for the rest of my life.

28
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,051
Why not? I could.

29
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,051
I just want to get started
and get it over with.

30
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,052
- You look good. Good luck.
- Thanks.

31
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:36,052
-Jenny will pick you up.
- I will walk.

32
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,052
- You sure?
- Yeah.

33
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:19,059
Hey, scary bitch alert.

34
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,059
Oh, God! I thought it was Satan.

35
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,060
Jesus Christ. She looking?

36
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
- Oh, God.
- Oh, she's looking.

37
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,060
Okay, I will find a warm place--
safe, warm place.

38
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,062
The almanac says today will bring
an arrival of something.

39
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:41,062
Yeah, wonderful.
I am getting my rag.

40
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,063
A new wholeness,
and with it a new balance.

41
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:45,063
Earth, air, water, fire.''

42
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:47,063
Maybe it's our fourth.

43
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,063
We don't need a fourth.

44
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:51,064
Nancy, we need someone
to call out the corners--

45
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:52,064
north, south, east and west.

46
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:55,064
Four would make a circle.

47
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,065
Maybe she can be our fourth.

48
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:02,065
I love a woman in uniform.

49
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:09,067
Bonjour, class.

50
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:36,071
What?

51
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,072
Oh, you mean did I get laid?

52
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:50,073
Beaucoup de laid.

53
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,075
What is that snail trail over there
saying about me?

54
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:11,076
You know, this is LA.
We should be learning Mexican.

55
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,077
That would be Spanish, genius.

56
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,085
She's here.

57
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:08,085
- She who?
- Someone to be the fourth.

58
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,085
She's the one.

59
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:13,086
You feeling okay?

60
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,087
That's her.

61
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:24,088
Hi. Do you guys mind
if I sit with you?

62
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:26,088
because I am supposed to find
a lab group.

63
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,089
Okay.

64
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,089
No, you can sit here.

65
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,090
Happy?

66
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,090
What?

67
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,092
- You're Sarah, right?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:56,092
Hi. I am Chris.

69
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:59,093
I just wanted to apologize
for those guys in French.

70
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:00,093
They're assholes.

71
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:02,093
You know what they say.
You are what you hang with.

72
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,094
Yeah, right.

73
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,094
Wait. Did you just
call me an asshole?

74
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:10,095
- You did, didn't you?
- I am sorry. My defenses are up.

75
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:12,095
People here have been
really rude to me.

76
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,095
Really? Who else?

77
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:16,096
These three girls.

78
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:19,096
They're behind you.
Don't stare.

79
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:23,097
That's slick.

80
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,097
Oh, shit.

81
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:30,098
It's the bitches of Eastwick.

82
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:33,098
- What?
- Whatever you do, stay away from them.

83
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:36,099
- Why?
- You see the one on the right?

84
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,099
She's a major slut.

85
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,099
I don't know from experience
or anything, but--

86
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:45,100
And the one in the middle,
she's got burn scars all over her body.

87
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,101
I haven't seen them,
but friends of mine have.

88
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:49,101
Anyway, they're--

89
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:51,101
Nah. Never mind.

90
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:52,101
What?

91
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:56,102
They're witches.

92
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,102
Witches?

93
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,102
That's what people say.

94
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:05,103
So what are you doing
after school?

95
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:07,104
I don't know.
Nothing, I guess.

96
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:09,104
- Really?
- Really.

97
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:11,104
I am busy.

98
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,105
Football practice.
You can come and watch.

99
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:18,105
Football practice.
That is so tempting.

100
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,110
Looking for someone?

101
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,111
Some of these football dicks
make their girlfriends...

102
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:58,111
come and watch them practice,
as if it's interesting.

103
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:01,112
Yeah, like, girlfriend, over there--
Chris Hooker.

104
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:03,112
I don't even know him.

105
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:06,113
Nancy's sorry about what happened
in biology.

106
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:10,113
And she's mean to everybody,
so don't take it personally.

107
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:11,113
You're Nancy?

108
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,114
She's Nancy, I am Bonnie
and that's Rochelle.

109
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:17,114
- Hi. I am Sarah.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

110
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,115
Do you want to go for coffee?

111
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,115
No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My dad's waiting for--

112
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:27,116
You can make something up.

113
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:29,116
Rochelle's ditching practice.

114
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,117
He comes on to anything
with tits, Sarah.

115
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:35,117
Except me.

116
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:37,117
I am not watching him.

117
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:39,118
He spreads disease.

118
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:43,118
I speak from personal experience.

119
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,119
Whoa, Chris! Go long!

120
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,119
Go for the pass, baby!

121
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
He's a jerk.

122
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:00,121
Come on.

123
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:05,122
- So you're coming, right?
- Where are we going?

124
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:06,122
Shopping.

125
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:08,122
Come on.

126
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,123
I don't have any money.

127
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,123
We get a five-finger discount.

128
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:14,123
Five-finger discount.

129
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,124
Sarah, where'd you live before?

130
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:20,124
San Francisco.

131
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:22,124
- Why'd you move?
- because it sucks.

132
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:24,125
My dad wanted to.

133
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,126
- Sucks here too.
- I know. You need a car here.

134
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:31,126
You need a car everywhere.

135
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:33,126
What's up with that?

136
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:36,127
I slit my wrists.

137
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:38,127
Sorry.

138
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,127
What'd you do it with?

139
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,128
With a kitchen knife.

140
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:45,128
You even did it the right way.

141
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:48,128
Yeah.

142
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,129
Punk rock. Let's go.

143
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,130
The right way  ?
How do you know the right way?

144
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,130
Shut up, Rochelle.

145
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,131
How do you know?

146
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:35,136
What?

147
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:37,136
Put this in your bag.

148
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:37,886
No.

149
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,137
Everything in nature steals,
you know.

150
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:45,137
Big animals steal from little ones.

151
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:47,138
They steal for survival.

152
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,138
- Besides, I already have a diary.
- This is different.

153
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,138
You put spells
and power thoughts in it...

154
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:54,139
and then you don't let anyone else
read it, ever.

155
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:56,139
Except maybe us.

156
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,139
Here.

157
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,140
You guys are really
into all this?

158
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Sort of.

159
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:18,142
That's not for you.

160
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:20,143
I am sorry.

161
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:24,143
What a beautiful ring.

162
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:26,144
It was your mother's.

163
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,144
Yeah, it was.

164
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:31,144
Are you going to pay for those?

165
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:33,145
Uh-huh.

166
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:35,145
You're not like your friends.

167
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:43,146
You know how to use candles?

168
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:45,147
Yeah. You light the wick.

169
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,147
More than that.

170
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,147
Red is for love.

171
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,148
Black--
Actually--

172
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:56,148
Why you don't read that?

173
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:59,149
- It explains it all.
- Okay.

174
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:00,149
Twenty dollars.

175
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,150
You know, I have never read
anything about this stuff before.

176
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,150
I mean, I don't follow it.

177
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,151
Maybe you're a natural witch.
Your power comes from within.

178
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:14,151
Come on, Sarah.

179
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:23,153
You guys, I think
I should head home.

180
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:26,153
Just look straight ahead
and keep up.

181
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:35,154
Please? My baby needs some food.

182
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:37,155
- I don't have anything.
- Don't give them money.

183
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:39,155
- You're gonna get nailed.
- I don't have anything.

184
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:42,155
I know you.
I have another snake for you.

185
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,156
Wait a second.
I have to talk to you.

186
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,156
I had a dream about you.

187
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:53,157
In my dream, you were dead.

188
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:57,158
I am talking to you.

189
00:16:57,158 --> 00:16:59,158
Come back to Jesus, child.

190
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:03,159
- Don't you run away from me!
- I am the door, the way--

191
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:06,159
I know what I am talking about!

192
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,160
I am in touch with the man!

193
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,161
Listen to me!

194
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,162
Come on, Sarah.
Let's get out of here.

195
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:34,164
Oh, my God!

196
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:39,164
What is it? Do you think
there's anybody back there?

197
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:42,165
It hit him. The car hit him,
and we made it happen.

198
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:44,165
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Definitely.

199
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,165
I thought to myself,
It's gonna hit him.

200
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,166
- I thought it too.
- Sarah, did you think it?

201
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,166
- Yeah.
- Then that's it. Sarah's the fourth.

202
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,167
North, south, east and west.
We can make things happen.

203
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:58,167
- This is it. This is real.
- Shit.

204
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,168
You guys, this is really weird.

205
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:03,168
Well, I mean, he was after you.

206
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:05,168
He was gonna hurt you, man.

207
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,169
It's not our fault.

208
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,169
You guys,
maybe he will really listen now.

209
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,169
Who?

210
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,169
Manon.

211
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,170
What's that?
That's like God?

212
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,170
No. Man invented God.
This is older than that.

213
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,171
Do you guys worship the devil?

214
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:24,171
It's like God and the devil.

215
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,172
I mean, it's everything.

216
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:32,173
It's the trees, it's the ground,
it's the rocks, it's the moon.

217
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:33,173
It's nature.

218
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:36,173
If God and the devil
were playing football...

219
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:40,174
Manon would be the stadium
that they played on.

220
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:43,174
It would be the sun
that shone down on them.

221
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:46,175
So, does stuff like tonight
happen to you a lot?

222
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:49,175
No. Not like that.

223
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,175
Other stuff.

224
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,176
Where did you learn it?

225
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:53,176
I don't know.

226
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,176
A natural witch.

227
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,177
I hate it.
It's always getting screwed up.

228
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:02,177
It's like, sometimes
I will want it to rain...

229
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:05,178
and a pipe will burst in my room
and it will just get flooded.

230
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,178
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.

231
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:11,179
Or I will want it
just to be quiet...

232
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,179
and I will wish for it, and I will go deaf
for three days straight.

233
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:18,180
If you can do that...

234
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,180
have you ever heard
of invoking the spirit?

235
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,181
It's when you call him.

236
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,181
Manon.

237
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,182
It's like--

238
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:35,182
It's like you take him
into you.

239
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,183
It's like he fills you.

240
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:42,183
He takes everything
that's gone wrong in your life...

241
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:45,184
and he makes it all better again.

242
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:50,185
Nothing makes everything
all better again.

243
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:54,185
Maybe not for you.

244
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:58,186
Where are you going?

245
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:00,186
You guys are freaking me out.

246
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:04,187
Oh, she's scared.

247
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:05,187
Nancy, we need her.

248
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,187
Like a hole in the head.

249
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:09,188
She will be back.

250
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,189
You sounded strange
when I called last night.

251
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:17,189
- I didn't think you'd come.
- No, just surprised.

252
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:19,189
- Surprised?
- Yeah.

253
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:21,189
I thought you'd be hanging out
with those girls.

254
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:24,190
- What girls?
- Those girls with the weird heads.

255
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,190
What's weird about their heads?

256
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,191
That one girl,
she's got a mammoth head.

257
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:31,191
Really?

258
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,191
Yeah. She looks like a St. Bernard.

259
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,192
I haven't noticed her.

260
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,192
I hate that big head thing.

261
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,192
Of Course it's better
than that shrunken-head thing.

262
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,193
Little, tiny-- Makes you want
to hang it from a rearview mirror.

263
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:45,193
What is your obsession
with heads?

264
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:48,194
I was just noticing
how great yours is.

265
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:50,194
- You like my head?
- Yeah. It's a good head.

266
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:52,194
- It's a good head?
- It's good.

267
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:54,195
It looks good for kissing.
Can I?

268
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:59,195
All right,
we will see you later, bro.

269
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:00,196
Nice meeting you, Sarah.

270
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:02,196
Yeah. Bye.

271
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,196
See you.

272
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:09,197
Come on. Let's go to my house.
Nobody's there.

273
00:21:09,197 --> 00:21:11,197
I don't want to go.

274
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:14,198
I can't.
I gotta go home.

275
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:15,198
All right.

276
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,198
Are you mad?

277
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,199
I am sorry.

278
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
It's okay.

279
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:35,201
So, hot stuff, how'd it go?

280
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:39,202
- How'd what go?
- Your date with Chris.

281
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:40,202
What are you talking about?

282
00:21:40,202 --> 00:21:43,202
Chris already told everybody.

283
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,203
He told everybody what?

284
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,203
That you guys did it.

285
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:51,203
But we didn't do it.

286
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:54,204
Maybe he was just trying
to save face then...

287
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:55,204
because...

288
00:21:56,204 --> 00:22:00,205
he's going around
the whole school saying that...

289
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:03,205
you're the lousiest lay
he's ever had.

290
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:05,206
And coming from him...

291
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:06,206
that's pretty bad.

292
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,207
- No, he didn't.
- He did.

293
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:18,208
He said the same thing
about Nancy.

294
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,208
Told you he was a jerk.

295
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:31,210
Can I talk to you for a second?

296
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,210
I am sorry.
Chris is really busy.

297
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,211
Maybe we could set something up for--
nice jacket-- later in the week.

298
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:39,211
What do you think?

299
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:42,211
Why'd you lie about me?

300
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:47,212
Look, I don't want to go out
with you again.

301
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,212
Okay?

302
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:51,213
Please stop begging.
It's pathetic.

303
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:01,214
Fuck you.

304
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,214
Nah.

305
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,215
But I will.

306
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:08,215
She's gonna cry,
and then I am gonna cry.

307
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:09,216
We're all gonna cry.

308
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:22,218
Someone just doesn't want
to go in the pool.

309
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:25,218
- Come on.
- This is a joke.

310
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:30,219
I can't even believe this.

311
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,221
Oh, wait. Here she goes.

312
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:45,221
Shark!

313
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:55,223
- Brilliant. Superb.
- Very good. It was great.

314
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:04,224
Oh, God, look.
There is a pubic hair in my brush.

315
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:07,225
Oh, no, wait. Wait.

316
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:10,225
That's just one of Rochelle's
little nappy hairs.

317
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,227
Why are you
doing this to me, Laura?

318
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,227
Do you think you're funny?

319
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:27,228
You really want to know why?

320
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:30,228
Yes, I really want to know why.

321
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:34,229
Because I don't like Negroids.

322
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:35,949
Sorry.

323
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:50,231
I have told you this before,
but I want to be really clear.

324
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:52,232
This is a very
experimental procedure...

325
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:56,232
and we can't make any warranties
regarding results or side effects.

326
00:24:56,232 --> 00:25:00,233
I can tell you unofficially
that there's little to no risk.

327
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:04,233
With this form of gene therapy,
it's relatively noninvasive.

328
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:07,234
It can be somewhat painful,
but noninvasive.

329
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,236
Okay. Try to stay relaxed.

330
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,237
I am moving the armature
over you now.

331
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:36,238
And you will feel a little sting
when the needle penetrates.

332
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:38,239
And then more
when the needle moves.

333
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,239
I will try and keep it
as brief as possible.

334
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Hold very still,
but keep breathing.

335
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:56,241
Okay?

336
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:03,243
Good. Keep your body relaxed.

337
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:06,243
Just a little more, Bonnie.

338
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:14,244
Don't move.

339
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:14,254
Ray, the light's out!

340
00:27:14,254 --> 00:27:16,254
Oh, man!

341
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:21,255
You didn't even pay the bill.
I gave you the money.

342
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:23,255
What are you doing home so late?
You're late!

343
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:27,256
It's the storm, Grace.
It's the connection.

344
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:29,256
- Oh, it's the storm?
- That's why the lights are out.

345
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:37,257
Neighbor's lights aren't out.

346
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:39,257
Got a light?

347
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,258
I give you money.

348
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:43,258
You tell me you pay the bill.

349
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:46,259
You can't even pay a bill?

350
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:47,259
What are you good for?

351
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:49,259
You know what I am good for.

352
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,261
We're going on a field trip.

353
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:07,262
Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt
your little social gathering.

354
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:09,262
Sorry, Sister.

355
00:28:45,268 --> 00:28:47,268
You girls watch out
for those weirdos.

356
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,268
We are the weirdos, mister.

357
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:14,272
Earth, air, fire, water.
Earth, air, fire, water.

358
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:25,274
It is better that you should
rush upon this blade...

359
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:28,274
than enter the circle
with fear in your heart.

360
00:29:28,274 --> 00:29:30,275
How do you enter?

361
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:32,275
With perfect love
and perfect trust.

362
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:41,276
It is better that you should
rush upon this blade...

363
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:44,277
than enter the circle
with fear in your heart.

364
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:46,277
How do you enter?

365
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:48,277
With perfect love
and perfect trust.

366
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:11,281
That's a girl.

367
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,282
As above...

368
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,282
so below.

369
00:30:42,286 --> 00:30:44,286
I drink of my sisters...

370
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:47,287
and I ask for the ability...

371
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:49,287
to not hate those
who hate me--

372
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,287
especially racist pieces...

373
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:54,288
of bleached-blonde shit
like Laura Lizzie.

374
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:57,288
Right on.

375
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:03,289
I drink of my sisters...

376
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:06,290
and I ask to love myself more...

377
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,290
and to allow myself
to be loved more by others--

378
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,291
especially Chris Hooker.

379
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,291
I know it's pathetic.

380
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,291
Definitely pathetic.

381
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,292
I drink of my sisters...

382
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:29,293
and I take into myself
the power to be beautiful...

383
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:31,293
outside as well as in.

384
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:42,295
I drink of my sisters...

385
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:46,296
and I take into myself...

386
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,297
all the power of Manon.

387
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:55,297
That's all?

388
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:03,298
Blessed be.

389
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:09,299
Thought you were gonna burp.

390
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Oh, my God.

391
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
What?

392
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Look.

393
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:22,301
It's Manon.

394
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:25,302
It's so beautiful.

395
00:32:26,302 --> 00:32:28,302
He's listening to us.

396
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:59,307
- Do you think it's working?
- I don't know.

397
00:32:59,307 --> 00:33:02,308
I think he just looked at me.
Did he look at me? Is he looking?

398
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:05,308
- Not right now, but he just did.
- So weird.

399
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,308
I know. Now he's looking.

400
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:09,309
- He's looking?
- Yes.

401
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:13,309
Is he still back there?

402
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,310
Yeah.

403
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,310
Yeah?

404
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,311
Never mind.

405
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:23,311
It's working.

406
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:26,311
That or he's gone
completely crazy.

407
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:29,312
- You hate me, right?
- No.

408
00:33:29,312 --> 00:33:30,312
- You don't?
- No.

409
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:33,312
because, you see, when you're a guy--
and I am--

410
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,313
people expect things.

411
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:39,313
I mean, I know I said
some nasty things about you.

412
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:42,314
- Did you tell your friends?
- What?

413
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,314
That you're a lying sack of shit.

414
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,314
No. But I will.

415
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:48,315
I will tell them tomorrow.
I will tell the truth.

416
00:33:49,315 --> 00:33:50,315
Good.

417
00:33:50,315 --> 00:33:53,316
- Can I sit with you in Mass?
- Yeah, sure.

418
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:10,318
Watch this.
Chris, could you carry these for me?

419
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:12,318
- They're really heavy.
- Yeah.

420
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:15,319
And Bonnie's too.
She's got a bad back.

421
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,319
And this. Thanks.

422
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:19,320
I can't believe it.

423
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,321
Could you hold my jock for me?
It's kind of heavy.

424
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:32,322
In the book of Genesis--

425
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,322
What are you, Stepford boy?

426
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:38,322
Sit.

427
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:50,324
Pay attention.

428
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,325
It's working.

429
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:58,326
Check it out.
Her spell is working.

430
00:34:58,326 --> 00:35:00,326
Nancy, oh, my God.
Would you look?

431
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:06,327
Oh, great. Really bad.

432
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:10,327
- Get one in, already.
- It's hard, you know.

433
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:13,328
You're, like, two feet
away from each other.

434
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,329
- Get off!.
- I am not that heavy.

435
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:19,329
Yeah, you're light
as a feather...

436
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,329
during deep space travel.

437
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:22,329
I am, actually.

438
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:26,330
Did you ever play that game,
Light as a feather, stiff as a board ?

439
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,331
One girl lays down,
and you surround her...

440
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:33,331
and you put your fingers
underneath.

441
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,331
You put your fingers where?

442
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:38,332
Okay.

443
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:39,332
Now you take your index finger...

444
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:41,332
and your middle finger...

445
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:44,333
and you put it under her
like this.

446
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,334
Now you have to imagine
that she's incredibly light...

447
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:51,334
like she's made out of air.

448
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,334
Now, is that her whole body,
or just her head?

449
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:55,334
Cow.

450
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:58,335
You guys, concentrate
or it's not gonna work.

451
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:06,336
I think I sprained my finger.

452
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:08,336
- Shut up!
- Focus!

453
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:10,337
Come on, you guys.
Ready?

454
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,337
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

455
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,338
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

456
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:48,343
Holy shit.

457
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,346
You guys, it's not working.

458
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:14,347
Shut up, or you're gonna fall.

459
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:19,347
How do I get down?

460
00:37:24,348 --> 00:37:25,348
Who's got the instructions?

461
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:27,349
Just keep concentrating.

462
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,349
Amazing.

463
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,350
Hi. I got clean towels
for everyone.

464
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:43,351
- Oh, my butt!
- What's going on in here?

465
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:46,352
- Nothing. Why?
- Are you girls getting high?

466
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,352
Are you okay?

467
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:56,353
You gotta try it.

468
00:37:56,353 --> 00:37:58,354
So I say we all chip in for it.

469
00:37:58,354 --> 00:37:59,354
How much can you give?

470
00:38:55,362 --> 00:38:57,363
You pulled my hair out!

471
00:38:57,363 --> 00:39:00,363
Sorry. I thought I saw a bug.
They have shampoo for that, you know.

472
00:39:01,363 --> 00:39:02,363
Stupid bitch.

473
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:14,365
- Laura really has split ends.
- Really?

474
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:17,366
I guess this confirms
she's not a natural blonde.

475
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:19,366
Bleach.

476
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:22,367
What do you think
will happen to Laura?

477
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:23,367
I don't know.

478
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:25,367
If she leaves you alone,
nothing will happen to her.

479
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,367
Nothing good.

480
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,368
Fat chance.

481
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:34,368
Who's that?

482
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:37,369
That's my real mother.

483
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:38,369
Where is she?

484
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:41,370
She died when she was having me.

485
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,090
Sorry.

486
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,370
It's okay.

487
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,371
Manon, take my scars.

488
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:55,372
Give me beauty outside
as well as in.

489
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,372
Manon, take my scars.

490
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:30,377
Thank you.

491
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:36,378
Don't hit your head on the board.

492
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:38,378
Put a lid on it, Laura.

493
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:54,381
Oh, my God.

494
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:58,381
What? What happened?

495
00:40:58,381 --> 00:41:00,382
I don't know!
What does it look like?

496
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:02,382
I don't know.
Hold still.

497
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:05,383
Gross!

498
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,383
- Is there a mark?
- Did you hit your head on something?

499
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,385
Now, I want you to remember that
we may need to make several passes...

500
00:41:21,385 --> 00:41:23,385
before we can see any results.

501
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:29,386
Is it better?

502
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,387
I can't tell yet, dear.

503
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:43,388
Just a minute.

504
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:46,389
What does it look like?

505
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,390
I don't know.

506
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,390
Just wait.

507
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,392
I can't believe it.

508
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:25,395
It worked.

509
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:29,396
- What?
- It worked.

510
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:42,398
because seriously, if you
don't stop it, you can go blind.

511
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:44,398
Hairy palms?

512
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,399
She was supposed
to come back today.

513
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:51,399
Did you talk to her?

514
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:53,399
Principal Draper has called
a special assembly...

515
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:56,400
during the second half
of the fifth per--

516
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Homeroom starts at 8:45 sharp.

517
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,401
Sorry.
My pedicure ran late.

518
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:08,402
- Wow.
- Holy shit.

519
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:11,402
- Hi, Bonnie.
- How's it going?

520
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:15,403
- Yeah, how's it going, Bonnie?
- My God.

521
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:19,403
You look so beautiful.
I can't believe it.

522
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:21,404
You did it.

523
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:22,404
No, I didn't do it.

524
00:43:22,404 --> 00:43:25,404
- Yeah, you totally did it.
- I helped.

525
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:28,405
Come on. You made Chris love you.
You own him.

526
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,405
You made Laura Lizzie's hair
fall out.

527
00:43:30,405 --> 00:43:34,406
You guys should see her.
She has to wear a hat every day now.

528
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:36,406
Poor Laura.

529
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,406
What's wrong with Nancy?

530
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:42,407
- Her spell's not working.
- What spell?

531
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:46,408
I don't know. I think she doesn't want
to be white trash any more.

532
00:43:46,408 --> 00:43:50,408
And I told her,  "You're white, honey.
Just deal with it."

533
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:13,412
Good.

534
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:18,412
Okay. Come on, come on.

535
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:23,413
- I can almost see through this thing.
- Leave me alone!

536
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,414
- God!
-Jesus!

537
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,414
You're supposed to act
like a father to the girl.

538
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:32,415
- I ain't her father.
- Thank God.

539
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:35,415
Her father's the one who paid you the
50 bucks for a bang in the back seat.

540
00:44:37,415 --> 00:44:39,416
Damn it!

541
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,416
- Don't you ever hit me!
- Don't you touch her!

542
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,416
Stop!

543
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,417
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God!

544
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:52,418
Pig.

545
00:45:01,419 --> 00:45:02,419
Ray?

546
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,420
Oxygen is flowing.

547
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,421
What's happening?

548
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:19,422
What's happening to him?

549
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:24,423
I know this is a difficult time
for you...

550
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:26,423
but it is procedure that I ask
just a few questions...

551
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:30,424
before we can start processing
the policy.

552
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:31,424
I don't understand.

553
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:33,424
What policy?

554
00:45:33,424 --> 00:45:37,425
Mr. Saunders had a whole life
pension plan through the company...

555
00:45:37,425 --> 00:45:38,425
and with benefits this size...

556
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:40,425
it's standard that I--

557
00:45:40,425 --> 00:45:42,426
What size?

558
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:45,426
Just a second here.

559
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:49,427
Sorry.

560
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:56,428
$1 75,000.

561
00:45:59,428 --> 00:46:00,428
A hundred--

562
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:05,429
Wait. Are you saying
that this goes to us?

563
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,429
To you.

564
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,430
A hundred and seventy-five--

565
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,430
What a dear, sweet man.

566
00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:25,512
$175,000!

567
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:38,434
I can't believe he's dead.

568
00:46:38,434 --> 00:46:41,435
- Do you think we killed him?
- No. Not at all.

569
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,435
Now don't be shy, honey.

570
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:47,436
Nice ass.

571
00:46:48,436 --> 00:46:50,436
- What? He has a cute butt.
- You're a slut.

572
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:52,436
- Maybe you should go ask him out.
- You know it.

573
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:54,437
Yeah. I like your butt.
Do you want to have dinner?

574
00:47:02,438 --> 00:47:04,438
This is nice.

575
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:07,439
Bedroom, bathroom, nightmare.

576
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:10,439
You look so pretty. I am so glad
you could come and see our apartment.

577
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:14,440
Our apartment.
We have an apartment!

578
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,440
And it's so big.
And look at this view.

579
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,441
- It's beautiful.
- And the couch--

580
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:23,441
This is our couch.
I love this couch.

581
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,442
I saw it in the window and said,
I have to have this couch.

582
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:28,442
And the guy, what an attitude.
I said, Honey, wrap it up.

583
00:47:28,442 --> 00:47:31,442
I am taking it right now.

584
00:47:31,442 --> 00:47:32,443
Cash!

585
00:47:34,443 --> 00:47:35,443
My juke box.

586
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,445
Every song on here
is by Connie Francis.

587
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:47,445
Yeah! Isn't that great?

588
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:50,445
Ever since I was a little girl
I said...

589
00:47:50,445 --> 00:47:53,446
All I want in life is a juke box...

590
00:47:53,446 --> 00:47:56,446
that plays nothing
but Connie Francis records.''

591
00:47:56,446 --> 00:47:58,447
That's great.

592
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:00,447
Who's Connie Francis?

593
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:03,447
Oh, shut up, honey.
Listen and learn. Connie Francis.

594
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,448
Can you come to my room, girls?

595
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,448
- Let's go.
- It was nice to see you, Mrs. Downs.

596
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:09,448
Connie Francis is--

597
00:48:09,448 --> 00:48:11,449
Wait a minute here.

598
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:15,449
Let's have
a little house warming party.

599
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:17,450
Sorry, Mom.

600
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,450
This is cool.

601
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,451
Ooh, nice.

602
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:30,452
I was reading and I found something
I thought you guys might be into.

603
00:48:31,452 --> 00:48:33,452
Glamour. Throwing a glamour--

604
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,453
an illusion so real
as to fool an onlooker--

605
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:39,453
is one of the oldest forms
of magic.

606
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:42,453
- Bet you I could do that.
- Do you think?

607
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:45,454
This is to feel.

608
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:48,454
This is to be.

609
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:52,455
Shape and form it...

610
00:48:52,455 --> 00:48:54,455
for all to see.

611
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:59,456
By the power
of three times three...

612
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:01,456
as I will it...

613
00:49:01,456 --> 00:49:04,457
so shall it be.

614
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:08,457
What?

615
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:09,458
My eyes are brown.

616
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:12,458
They're usually green.

617
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:17,459
You can do that with contacts.

618
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:20,459
Yeah, but it's good.
I mean, it suits you.

619
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:23,460
Subtle. But good.

620
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,460
You want something bigger?

621
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,460
- I want bigger.
- Bigger.

622
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,461
We have to concentrate.
Come on.

623
00:49:36,462 --> 00:49:37,462
Ready?

624
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:50,464
Are you impressed?

625
00:49:51,464 --> 00:49:53,464
- Yeah, I am impressed!
- You look like Loni Anderson.

626
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:55,465
- You want to touch it?
- Yeah.

627
00:49:57,465 --> 00:49:58,465
It's real!

628
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:01,466
And so much simpler
than going to a salon.

629
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,466
- Yeah, a really shitty salon.
- You try it.

630
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:05,466
Wait. Watch.

631
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,468
- Make me a blonde.
- Me, me, me.

632
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:16,468
I don't think so.
No way.

633
00:50:16,468 --> 00:50:18,468
Do something to me.

634
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:19,469
What do you want?

635
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:22,469
A smaller ass.

636
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:27,470
Sarah!

637
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:34,471
Sarah!

638
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:44,472
Oh, no. No.

639
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:46,473
Why didn't you answer the phone?

640
00:50:46,473 --> 00:50:49,473
It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris.

641
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:52,474
Oh, yeah, that's a good reason.

642
00:50:52,474 --> 00:50:55,474
You know what I was thinking?
Maybe we could move in together.

643
00:50:56,474 --> 00:51:00,475
I don't think I am ready
for that kind of commitment right now.

644
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,475
Oh, shit.

645
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:05,476
It's just that I can't stop
thinking about you.

646
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,476
I don't know why,
but I think I love you.

647
00:51:08,476 --> 00:51:10,476
I have never loved
anyone before, except...

648
00:51:10,476 --> 00:51:15,477
maybe my mom and this little puppy
I had when I was little.

649
00:51:16,477 --> 00:51:18,478
I think you should go home, Chris.

650
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:20,478
No! Sarah, wait, please.

651
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:22,478
Sarah, please. Look.

652
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:26,479
I don't know what's happening to me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

653
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:28,479
Can I help you?

654
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:31,480
No. Nobody can help me.

655
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:42,481
Here again.
What can I do for you today?

656
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:44,482
We need provisions.

657
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:46,482
I need to undo a love spell.

658
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:50,483
When you open a floodgate,
how do you undo it?

659
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:54,483
You unleash something with a spell.
There is no undoing.

660
00:51:54,483 --> 00:51:56,484
It must run its course.

661
00:51:56,484 --> 00:51:58,484
You should let him suffer.

662
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,485
It's not for you
to judge suffering.

663
00:52:02,485 --> 00:52:05,485
When do we find out
what's behind the curtain?

664
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:09,486
What are you doing, hiding all
the missing kids from the neighborhood?

665
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:11,486
What's there? Black magic?

666
00:52:12,486 --> 00:52:16,487
True magic is
neither black nor white.

667
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:18,487
It's both
because nature is both.

668
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:20,487
Loving and cruel,
all at the same time.

669
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:25,488
The only good or bad
is in the heart of the witch.

670
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:28,489
Life keeps a balance on its own.
You understand?

671
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:30,489
Not really.

672
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:33,489
Well, then understand this.

673
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:36,490
Whatever you send out
you get back times three.

674
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,490
Wait. We didn't read that
in any book.

675
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:43,491
No, it's part of
a basic spiritual truth...

676
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:45,491
said in many ways in many faiths.

677
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:49,492
Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.

678
00:53:01,494 --> 00:53:03,494
I wanna buy this book.

679
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:06,494
You want to invoke the spirit?

680
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:09,495
You must be experienced to do this.
It's very dangerous.

681
00:53:09,495 --> 00:53:14,496
Look, lady, I am a big girl, okay?
Now please just sell me the book.

682
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:17,496
- How much?
- Twenty-five.

683
00:53:17,496 --> 00:53:18,496
What do you know?

684
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,497
I have money.

685
00:54:21,506 --> 00:54:24,507
When things were
the worst for me...

686
00:54:24,507 --> 00:54:27,507
just before I tried
to kill myself...

687
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:30,507
I used to hallucinate things.

688
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:34,508
I'd close my eyes,
and all I would see were...

689
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:37,509
snakes and bugs everywhere.

690
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,509
Then I'd open them,
and they'd still be there.

691
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:42,509
They wouldn't go away.

692
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:44,510
They're everywhere.

693
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:49,510
You know, the serpent
is a very powerful being.

694
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:52,511
You should respect it.

695
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:56,512
Aren't you powerful?
Yes, you are.

696
00:54:59,512 --> 00:55:00,512
All right.

697
00:55:01,512 --> 00:55:03,513
Enough screwing around.

698
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:08,513
Let's call the corners,
shall we?

699
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:20,515
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the east...

700
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:23,516
the powers of air and invention.

701
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:25,516
Hear me!

702
00:55:25,516 --> 00:55:28,516
- Us!
- Hear us.

703
00:55:28,516 --> 00:55:31,517
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the south...

704
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:33,517
powers of fire and feeling.

705
00:55:33,517 --> 00:55:34,517
Hear us.

706
00:55:34,517 --> 00:55:37,518
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the west...

707
00:55:37,518 --> 00:55:39,518
powers of water and intuition.

708
00:55:39,518 --> 00:55:41,518
Hear us.

709
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:44,519
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north...

710
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:47,519
by the powers of mother and earth.

711
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:48,520
Hear us.

712
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,521
Aid us in our magical working
on this May's eve.

713
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,521
Serpent of old...

714
00:56:01,522 --> 00:56:03,522
ruler of deep...

715
00:56:03,522 --> 00:56:05,522
guardian of the bitter sea...

716
00:56:08,523 --> 00:56:09,523
show us your glory...

717
00:56:11,523 --> 00:56:12,523
show us your power.

718
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:16,524
We pray of thee.

719
00:56:19,524 --> 00:56:20,525
We invoke thee.

720
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:29,526
O serpent one, hear our calls.

721
00:56:29,526 --> 00:56:30,526
Hear our prayers.

722
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:33,527
Ancient wise one...

723
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:35,527
teach us thy ways.

724
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:37,527
We summon and stir thee.

725
00:56:39,527 --> 00:56:41,528
Lend us your powers.

726
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:43,528
Show us your glory.

727
00:56:43,528 --> 00:56:46,529
We invoke thee!

728
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:54,530
Manon, fill me!

729
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:13,533
Is he here?

730
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,540
Did you feel that?

731
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,541
He blessed me.

732
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:09,541
I can feel him
running through my veins.

733
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:12,542
He's still in me.

734
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:15,542
It's so amazing.

735
00:58:49,548 --> 00:58:51,548
Look at this.

736
00:58:54,548 --> 00:58:56,549
It's so beautiful.

737
00:58:59,549 --> 00:59:00,549
This is a gift.

738
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,550
These are my gifts!

739
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,551
I can feel you in me!

740
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:18,552
I am your daughter now.

741
00:59:20,552 --> 00:59:23,553
He's everywhere!
He's in everything!

742
00:59:24,553 --> 00:59:28,554
Listen, all I am saying is
I think it's enough already.

743
00:59:28,554 --> 00:59:31,554
I don't know what's going on with this.
I am completely humiliating Chris...

744
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:34,555
when all I wanted
was for him to like me.

745
00:59:36,555 --> 00:59:38,555
And Bonnie,
what's going on with you?

746
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:42,556
You used to be nice.
Now you're completely narcissistic.

747
00:59:42,556 --> 00:59:45,556
Excuse me, but I spent a big chunk
of my life being a monster.

748
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:50,557
Now that I am not, I am having a good
time. Sorry if that bothers you.

749
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:53,558
Can you guys tell me
what color that light is?

750
00:59:53,558 --> 00:59:55,558
It's red.

751
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,558
Doesn't red mean stop?

752
00:59:57,558 --> 01:00:00,559
Yeah, red does mean stop.

753
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:07,560
It's like what Lirio was talking about--
throwing things out of balance.

754
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,560
I know you think we're getting
what we want now...

755
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,561
but it's going to come back
to us threefold.

756
01:00:14,561 --> 01:00:18,561
Are we actually having
a theological conversation here?

757
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:21,562
I mean, it's fun, it's scary.

758
01:00:21,562 --> 01:00:23,562
I mean, who gives a shit?

759
01:00:23,562 --> 01:00:25,563
Oh, Nancy, we do.

760
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:27,563
What do you guys think?

761
01:00:27,563 --> 01:00:30,563
- They don't think.
- Bitch!

762
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:34,564
Stop trying to win them over,
because it won't work.

763
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,564
I am not trying to win them over.
You're paranoid.

764
01:00:36,564 --> 01:00:38,565
- I am paranoid?
- Paranoid.

765
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:40,565
I am not paranoid!

766
01:00:40,565 --> 01:00:43,565
- Paranoid.
- Will you guys shut up!

767
01:00:45,566 --> 01:00:48,566
Do you want in,
or do you want to leave this circle?

768
01:00:48,566 --> 01:00:50,566
Just tell me right now.

769
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:52,567
Why must it always be
that way with you?

770
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:54,567
Because that's the way it is!

771
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,567
All I am saying is,
I think you should think.

772
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:58,568
And I don't want out.

773
01:01:00,568 --> 01:01:03,568
One of these times,
the lights not gonna be green.

774
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:06,569
Oh, waah!
We're scared, Sarah?

775
01:01:06,569 --> 01:01:08,569
You scared, hmm?

776
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:23,572
That was actually pretty close.

777
01:01:49,576 --> 01:01:52,576
It just keeps falling out.

778
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:54,576
I don't understand it.

779
01:01:55,577 --> 01:01:57,577
What did I do to deserve this?

780
01:02:00,577 --> 01:02:01,297
Laura!

781
01:02:03,578 --> 01:02:05,578
What's the matter?
What happened?

782
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:07,578
I don't know.

783
01:02:07,578 --> 01:02:10,579
Calm down. Calm down.
It's okay.

784
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:13,579
I am gonna go get somebody, okay?
Stay right here.

785
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:24,581
Sarah, come on, please.

786
01:02:24,581 --> 01:02:27,581
You look like you need
to talk to someone anyways.

787
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:30,582
How do you know what I look like?
We're talking on the phone.

788
01:02:30,582 --> 01:02:34,583
Look, it's important.
I just need to be alone with you.

789
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,583
I have to see you.
I don't know why, but--

790
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:41,584
Why are you being this way?
It's just dinner. Come on.

791
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:43,584
I don't know.

792
01:02:43,584 --> 01:02:44,584
Please.

793
01:02:45,584 --> 01:02:47,585
Okay. Tomorrow night.

794
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:50,585
Yes! Yes! Yes!

795
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:53,586
- I will see you then.
- Bye.

796
01:02:57,586 --> 01:03:00,587
So when I started hanging out
with them, I was almost relieved.

797
01:03:00,587 --> 01:03:04,587
I didn't have that many
close friends in San Francisco.

798
01:03:04,587 --> 01:03:08,588
It just felt really nice
to belong.

799
01:03:08,588 --> 01:03:11,588
I disagreed with them once,
and they turned their backs on me.

800
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,589
That's not friendship.

801
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:17,589
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
- You do?

802
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:20,590
Yeah. Sometimes it's like
we're one person. Know what I mean?

803
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,590
No, I am not sure.

804
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:27,591
I am not sure either.
That's so funny.

805
01:03:27,591 --> 01:03:31,591
I was just thinking,
I have no idea what I am talking about.

806
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:38,593
Aren't we supposed to go to a restaurant
or something like that?

807
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:39,593
No.

808
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:43,593
All right. Look, Chris.

809
01:03:43,593 --> 01:03:48,594
I know you think you feel
really intensely...

810
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:52,595
but do you ever stop
and wonder where it comes from?

811
01:03:55,595 --> 01:03:58,596
I can't think.
I just feel.

812
01:03:58,596 --> 01:04:02,596
It's weird how it happened.
One day, I couldn't wait to see you.

813
01:04:02,596 --> 01:04:06,597
It's like that every day, but now
that I have you, I am not letting go.

814
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:11,598
Stop and think about what you're saying.
You don't even know me.

815
01:04:13,598 --> 01:04:15,598
Here. I will give you a back rub.

816
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:18,599
I don't want a back rub.
I don't want you to. Just let go.

817
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,599
Just relax for a second.
Turn around.

818
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,600
- I think you should take me home.
- No! Sarah, come on.

819
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,600
- Take me home, okay?
-Just hold me, okay?

820
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,600
- Let go.
- Hold me first.

821
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,600
Fine. I will walk.

822
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,601
Goddamn it!

823
01:04:34,601 --> 01:04:36,602
Sarah, get back--
Come back here.

824
01:04:38,602 --> 01:04:42,602
- Goddamn it!
- Please, Chris! Let go of my arm!

825
01:04:42,602 --> 01:04:44,603
Stay still!

826
01:04:44,603 --> 01:04:46,603
No! Please!

827
01:04:46,603 --> 01:04:47,603
Let go!

828
01:05:24,609 --> 01:05:28,610
Oh, my God.
Sarah, come here.

829
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:30,610
What happened?

830
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,610
Are you okay?

831
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:37,611
You should have seen
the look in his eyes.

832
01:05:37,611 --> 01:05:38,611
It was so weird.

833
01:05:40,611 --> 01:05:42,612
They seemed empty,
like it wasn't even him.

834
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,613
Where would he be?

835
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:51,613
There's a party.

836
01:05:51,613 --> 01:05:53,613
At Trey's.

837
01:05:54,614 --> 01:05:56,614
Just leave it alone.

838
01:05:56,614 --> 01:05:59,614
Don't go.
You're not going to help anything.

839
01:06:01,615 --> 01:06:03,615
I am gonna go play.

840
01:06:18,617 --> 01:06:20,618
I cannot believe she's here.

841
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:27,619
You guys...

842
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:30,619
Nancy Downs is here.

843
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:31,339
Nancy?

844
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,620
I am here. You're here.
We're all here.

845
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:45,622
Is Sarah with you?

846
01:07:03,624 --> 01:07:05,625
What's going on?

847
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:08,625
Where is she?

848
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:22,627
You and me, we have had
some pretty good times together.

849
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:26,628
If I remember correctly...

850
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:29,628
we had some pretty hot times too.

851
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:34,629
- Remember?
- I have been trying to forget.

852
01:07:34,629 --> 01:07:36,629
Forget?

853
01:07:36,629 --> 01:07:38,630
- Did you forget this?
- Stop.

854
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:44,631
What's the matter?
Not in the mood?

855
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:47,631
Not to get my dick bitten off.

856
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,631
What makes you think
that's what I wanna do?

857
01:07:50,632 --> 01:07:51,632
Go away.

858
01:07:55,632 --> 01:07:57,633
Go away.

859
01:08:25,637 --> 01:08:27,637
What the--

860
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:33,638
Surprise.

861
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,640
Make love to me, Chris.

862
01:08:59,642 --> 01:09:01,643
We should not be here.

863
01:09:01,643 --> 01:09:03,643
Neither should Nancy.

864
01:09:13,645 --> 01:09:15,645
Rochelle.

865
01:09:18,645 --> 01:09:19,645
How's it going?

866
01:09:20,646 --> 01:09:22,646
Fine.

867
01:09:22,646 --> 01:09:24,646
Listen.

868
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:42,649
You're a witch!

869
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:46,650
- They were right.
- They usually are.

870
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:50,650
- Nancy, get off the bed. Let's go.
- She's a witch too.

871
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:54,651
The only reason you're in love with her
is because she cast a spell on you.

872
01:09:55,651 --> 01:09:58,651
Yes. Sad, but true.

873
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:02,652
That's why I am here--
to help you forget about her.

874
01:10:03,652 --> 01:10:06,653
- What do you care?
- Nancy, get off the bed!

875
01:10:06,653 --> 01:10:09,653
You scared the shit out of him.
Thank you very much. Let's go.

876
01:10:09,653 --> 01:10:12,654
No! He's gotta pay.

877
01:10:12,654 --> 01:10:14,654
You're just jealous.

878
01:10:15,654 --> 01:10:18,655
Jealous? Jealous?

879
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:23,655
You don't even exist to me!

880
01:10:24,656 --> 01:10:26,656
You don't even exist.

881
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:29,656
You are nothing.

882
01:10:29,656 --> 01:10:32,657
You are shit.

883
01:10:32,657 --> 01:10:35,657
You don't exist.

884
01:10:35,657 --> 01:10:39,658
The only way you know how to treat
women is by treating them like whores!

885
01:10:39,658 --> 01:10:41,658
When you're the whore!

886
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:43,658
And that's gonna stop!

887
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:45,659
Do you understand?

888
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,659
Do you understand
what I am saying, huh?

889
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,660
I am sorry.

890
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,660
He's sorry?

891
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,660
Oh, he's sorry!
He's sorry! He's sorry!

892
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:02,661
Sorry, my ass!

893
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:25,665
I didn't want him to get hurt.

894
01:11:25,665 --> 01:11:27,665
I liked him.

895
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:32,666
I think that he was
a good guy underneath it all.

896
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,667
I didn't know
that it would go this far.

897
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,667
Honey, come on.
I mean, it's hard for you.

898
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:42,668
- It was an accident.
- Dad, I need to be alone right now.

899
01:11:42,668 --> 01:11:46,668
- Please, honey, listen.
- Don't touch me!

900
01:11:46,668 --> 01:11:48,669
Everything I touch turns to shit.

901
01:12:18,673 --> 01:12:22,674
I bind you
from doing harm, Nancy....

902
01:12:22,674 --> 01:12:25,674
harm against other people...

903
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,675
and harm against yourself.

904
01:12:30,675 --> 01:12:33,676
I bind you
from doing harm, Nancy.

905
01:12:34,676 --> 01:12:36,676
Harm against other people...

906
01:12:36,676 --> 01:12:38,676
and harm against yourself.

907
01:13:12,682 --> 01:13:13,682
Stop it!

908
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:17,682
Stop it!

909
01:13:56,688 --> 01:14:00,689
There you are.
We have been looking everywhere for you.

910
01:14:00,689 --> 01:14:03,690
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am fine.

911
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:07,690
We heard the police came to your house.
They came to mine too.

912
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,691
Yeah. Well, I didn't
tell them anything.

913
01:14:10,691 --> 01:14:12,691
Then why do you want
to leave the circle?

914
01:14:12,691 --> 01:14:14,691
- I didn't say--
- You don't need to say it.

915
01:14:14,691 --> 01:14:16,692
You're thinking it.

916
01:14:18,692 --> 01:14:21,692
Look, people are dead.
Chris and Ray are--

917
01:14:21,692 --> 01:14:23,693
Those were accidents.

918
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:26,693
- They deserved it.
- Says who?

919
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:28,693
Says me.
You know it's true.

920
01:14:28,693 --> 01:14:29,694
Fine. Whatever. I am out.

921
01:14:29,694 --> 01:14:32,694
Fine. That's fine.

922
01:14:32,694 --> 01:14:35,694
We don't really need
a fourth anymore, do we?

923
01:14:40,695 --> 01:14:42,696
But if you're gonna leave
the circle...

924
01:14:42,696 --> 01:14:44,696
you might want to think
about leaving the school.

925
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:47,696
And maybe the city too.
We're not sure.

926
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:49,697
Or the planet.

927
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:55,698
And please don't do
any more spells on me.

928
01:14:56,698 --> 01:14:57,698
I didn't--

929
01:14:59,698 --> 01:15:02,699
You know, in the old days...

930
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,699
if a witch betrayed her coven...

931
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,700
they would kill her.

932
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:21,702
Bye!

933
01:15:24,702 --> 01:15:26,702
Sweet dreams, Sarah.

934
01:15:26,702 --> 01:15:28,703
How have you been sleeping?

935
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:49,706
Hello?

936
01:15:53,707 --> 01:15:54,707
Yes?

937
01:15:55,707 --> 01:15:56,707
Hello.

938
01:15:56,707 --> 01:15:59,708
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

939
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,708
Oh, darling, what's wrong?

940
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,708
I know I don't know you
very well...

941
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:07,709
but I just didn't know
where else to go.

942
01:16:07,709 --> 01:16:10,709
It's those girls
that I always come in here with.

943
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:13,710
They're trying to use magic
against me.

944
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:15,710
You don't understand.
They killed people.

945
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,710
I tried to do a binding,
and it didn't work.

946
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:21,711
And now, it's like everywhere I turn,
they're all around me.

947
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:25,712
No matter what I do, they're still
there. I don't know what to do.

948
01:16:25,712 --> 01:16:27,712
You understand?
She's inside my dreams.

949
01:16:27,712 --> 01:16:31,712
She knows what's going on inside
my head. She can read my mind.

950
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:36,713
I am so sorry. I just didn't have
anywhere else to go.

951
01:16:36,713 --> 01:16:37,713
Please.

952
01:16:43,714 --> 01:16:44,714
Come.

953
01:17:02,717 --> 01:17:04,718
What is this?

954
01:17:04,718 --> 01:17:07,718
This temple is built
on a place of power.

955
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,719
Sarah, you have
a tremendous light inside you...

956
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,720
more than any witch
I have ever known.

957
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,720
You must not be afraid.

958
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,721
I can't control it.
I always end up hurting somebody.

959
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:29,721
Do you hear
the voice of your mother?

960
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:31,722
What about her?

961
01:17:32,722 --> 01:17:34,722
She's telling you to be strong.

962
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:36,723
She was a witch, too, of course.

963
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:40,723
Didn't you know?

964
01:17:46,724 --> 01:17:48,724
You can defeat
those who challenge you...

965
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:50,725
but you must surrender yourself...

966
01:17:50,725 --> 01:17:53,725
to the higher power.

967
01:18:00,726 --> 01:18:02,727
You must invoke the spirit.

968
01:18:02,727 --> 01:18:05,727
But it made Nancy crazy.

969
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:07,727
She takes it to a dark place.

970
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:12,728
- Don't be afraid. Invoke him.
- I can't.

971
01:18:12,728 --> 01:18:14,728
There is no other way.

972
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:20,729
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north--

973
01:18:29,731 --> 01:18:31,731
It's Nancy.

974
01:18:31,731 --> 01:18:33,731
I can't stay here.

975
01:18:33,731 --> 01:18:35,732
No, Sarah! Stop! Sarah!

976
01:19:03,736 --> 01:19:04,736
Hello?

977
01:19:06,737 --> 01:19:07,737
Dad!

978
01:19:08,737 --> 01:19:09,457
Jenny!

979
01:19:24,739 --> 01:19:26,740
- Hello?
- They're gone.

980
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:29,740
They flew back to San Francisco.

981
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,741
They thought you ranaway
back home.

982
01:19:35,741 --> 01:19:37,741
Look, Sarah...

983
01:19:38,741 --> 01:19:41,742
there's been an accident, man.

984
01:19:41,742 --> 01:19:43,742
What are you talking about?

985
01:19:44,742 --> 01:19:48,743
- What?
- It's been allover the news.

986
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,744
Go look at your TV.

987
01:19:53,744 --> 01:19:57,744
Wreckage from the plane was scattered
over a one-mile square area.

988
01:19:57,744 --> 01:19:59,745
Authorities suspect
severe wind shear...

989
01:19:59,745 --> 01:20:02,745
may have been responsible
for today's tragedy.

990
01:20:02,745 --> 01:20:04,746
FAA officials have retrieved
the blackbox...

991
01:20:04,746 --> 01:20:07,746
and a full investigation is pending.

992
01:20:07,746 --> 01:20:09,746
Once again,
Global flight 321...

993
01:20:09,746 --> 01:20:13,747
from Los Angeles to San Francisco
has crashed with no survivors.

994
01:20:13,747 --> 01:20:16,747
More on this story
as details become available.

995
01:21:11,756 --> 01:21:13,756
Oh, my God.

996
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:08,765
Please. Please stop it.

997
01:22:08,765 --> 01:22:10,765
Stop it!

998
01:22:12,765 --> 01:22:13,766
Stop it!

999
01:22:14,766 --> 01:22:16,766
Go away, please!

1000
01:22:18,766 --> 01:22:20,767
- Stop it!
- Gotcha!

1001
01:22:23,767 --> 01:22:27,768
God, if I was
as pathetic as you are...

1002
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:30,768
I would have killed myself
ages ago.

1003
01:22:30,768 --> 01:22:32,768
You should get on with it.

1004
01:23:21,776 --> 01:23:23,776
Where are my dad and Jenny?

1005
01:23:25,777 --> 01:23:28,777
You will be seeing them soon enough.

1006
01:23:28,777 --> 01:23:31,778
You're going to kill yourself
tonight, my dear.

1007
01:23:32,778 --> 01:23:34,778
No, I am not.

1008
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:38,779
Surprise.

1009
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:42,779
Really?

1010
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:44,780
Look in your eyes tells me...

1011
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:47,780
you might not be so sure.

1012
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:51,781
After all, you have every reason
in the world to do it.

1013
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:54,781
I mean, you killed Chris...

1014
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:57,782
and you killed your mom--

1015
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,782
You killed your mom
when you were coming out of her.

1016
01:23:59,782 --> 01:24:01,782
Now, that is really special.

1017
01:24:01,782 --> 01:24:05,783
Even I couldn't go that low.
Bravo!

1018
01:24:05,783 --> 01:24:07,783
Stop it, please!

1019
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:12,784
What's the deal?
Why doesn't she use magic on us?

1020
01:24:12,784 --> 01:24:14,784
Because she's weak!

1021
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:17,785
Weak, weak, weak.

1022
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:19,785
Stop, please.

1023
01:24:20,785 --> 01:24:23,786
Oh, God, you're so disgusting.

1024
01:24:26,786 --> 01:24:29,787
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.

1025
01:24:29,787 --> 01:24:31,787
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.

1026
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,790
- I didn't write that.
- It doesn't matter.

1027
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,790
Hand writing still looks the same.

1028
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:53,790
What's wrong
with your scars, Sarah?

1029
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:59,791
It isn't real.

1030
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:02,792
Then why are you still bleeding?

1031
01:25:07,793 --> 01:25:08,793
Run!

1032
01:25:08,793 --> 01:25:13,793
Run back up to your room
like the little coward that you are.

1033
01:25:13,793 --> 01:25:15,794
That's right.

1034
01:25:15,794 --> 01:25:18,794
She's so pathetic!

1035
01:25:22,795 --> 01:25:24,795
Stop it!

1036
01:25:30,796 --> 01:25:33,797
- Please, somebody help me!
- I am bleeding!

1037
01:25:33,797 --> 01:25:34,797
Please.

1038
01:25:42,798 --> 01:25:44,798
What can I do?

1039
01:25:51,799 --> 01:25:54,800
Rochelle, go upstairs.
See what's going on.

1040
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,800
No. This whole thing is just--

1041
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:04,801
Get your lazy ass up those stairs
or I will slit your throat!

1042
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:07,802
- Dead as she is.
- Come on. I will go with you.

1043
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:09,802
Little shit.

1044
01:26:12,803 --> 01:26:16,803
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north...

1045
01:26:16,803 --> 01:26:19,804
by the powers of mother and earth.

1046
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:22,804
I invoke thee.
I invoke thee.

1047
01:26:28,805 --> 01:26:31,806
By the powers of three times three,
make them see, make them see.

1048
01:26:39,807 --> 01:26:40,807
Bonnie?

1049
01:26:45,808 --> 01:26:48,808
My hair. My hair!

1050
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:55,809
It's coming back times three.

1051
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,810
Not again.

1052
01:27:04,811 --> 01:27:06,811
What happened?

1053
01:27:06,811 --> 01:27:08,811
Where are you going?

1054
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:17,813
Hail to the guardians of the...

1055
01:27:17,813 --> 01:27:19,813
watchtowers--

1056
01:27:22,814 --> 01:27:25,814
Don't be afraid.

1057
01:27:25,814 --> 01:27:28,814
Reach inside yourself.

1058
01:27:30,815 --> 01:27:32,815
Reach inside yourself.

1059
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:38,816
Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north...

1060
01:27:38,816 --> 01:27:42,817
by the powers of mother and earth.

1061
01:27:42,817 --> 01:27:43,817
I invoke thee.

1062
01:27:46,817 --> 01:27:48,818
I invoke thee, Manon.

1063
01:27:49,818 --> 01:27:51,818
I invoke thee, Manon.

1064
01:29:38,835 --> 01:29:42,835
Did I frighten you, Nancy?
I am sorry.

1065
01:29:43,835 --> 01:29:47,836
What's going on?
Why aren't you dead?

1066
01:29:47,836 --> 01:29:49,836
Came to me.

1067
01:29:49,836 --> 01:29:51,837
Saved me.

1068
01:29:53,837 --> 01:29:56,837
And he wanted me
to give you a message.

1069
01:29:56,837 --> 01:29:58,838
You're in deep shit.

1070
01:29:58,838 --> 01:30:02,838
He says you have abused what he's given
you and now you have to pay the price.

1071
01:30:04,839 --> 01:30:06,839
Did he?

1072
01:30:06,839 --> 01:30:08,839
He did.

1073
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,840
By the way, what happened
to Rochelle and Bonnie?

1074
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:20,841
They rushed out of here
without even saying good-bye.

1075
01:30:20,841 --> 01:30:22,841
That's bad manners.

1076
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:33,843
What's going on?
What is going on?

1077
01:30:39,844 --> 01:30:41,844
Stop it! Stop it!

1078
01:30:59,847 --> 01:31:01,847
Relax. It's only magic.

1079
01:31:05,848 --> 01:31:07,848
Now who's pathetic?

1080
01:31:09,849 --> 01:31:10,849
Look.

1081
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,851
I know I am a little crazy.

1082
01:31:24,851 --> 01:31:26,851
I don't mean to be.

1083
01:31:28,852 --> 01:31:31,852
It all got out of hand,
and I am sorry.

1084
01:31:32,852 --> 01:31:35,853
No more games, okay?

1085
01:31:37,853 --> 01:31:39,853
Sarah, I am so sorry.

1086
01:31:40,854 --> 01:31:42,854
Good.

1087
01:31:44,854 --> 01:31:47,855
- I am gonna go.
- One thing first.

1088
01:31:49,855 --> 01:31:51,855
I bind you, Nancy,
from doing harm...

1089
01:31:51,855 --> 01:31:53,856
harm against other people
and harm against yourself.

1090
01:31:53,856 --> 01:31:55,856
Wait.

1091
01:31:58,856 --> 01:32:00,857
Wait.

1092
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:14,859
I called him before you!

1093
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:22,860
You bitch! You bitch!
I will kill you!

1094
01:32:25,861 --> 01:32:26,861
I will kill you!

1095
01:32:53,865 --> 01:32:55,865
Where are you?

1096
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:00,866
Where are you, Sarah?

1097
01:33:02,866 --> 01:33:03,866
Where are you?

1098
01:33:18,869 --> 01:33:20,869
Tricky. Tricky, tricky, tricky.

1099
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:58,875
I bind you, Nancy,
from doing harm.

1100
01:34:15,878 --> 01:34:17,878
Hi, Sarah. How are you?

1101
01:34:18,878 --> 01:34:19,878
Good.

1102
01:34:19,878 --> 01:34:22,879
Then again,
I can sleep at night, so--

1103
01:34:22,879 --> 01:34:24,879
How are you?

1104
01:34:24,879 --> 01:34:28,880
We want to apologize.

1105
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:33,880
- We feel really bad about--
- Trying to kill me?

1106
01:34:34,881 --> 01:34:35,881
Yeah.

1107
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:39,881
Honestly, we never thought
it would go that far.

1108
01:34:40,881 --> 01:34:41,882
Hi, girls.
How're you doing?

1109
01:34:41,882 --> 01:34:43,882
Hi, Mr. Bailey.

1110
01:34:43,882 --> 01:34:47,883
And you know that thing on TV
about the plane crash...

1111
01:34:47,883 --> 01:34:49,883
was just a glamour.

1112
01:34:49,883 --> 01:34:51,883
It was a practical joke.

1113
01:34:51,883 --> 01:34:52,603
Funny.

1114
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:54,884
Sarah, wait.

1115
01:34:57,884 --> 01:35:01,885
We were just wondering,
do you still have any powers?

1116
01:35:01,885 --> 01:35:03,885
because we don't.

1117
01:35:04,885 --> 01:35:05,605
Sorry.

1118
01:35:06,886 --> 01:35:09,886
So if you ever want
to just hang out...

1119
01:35:09,886 --> 01:35:11,886
and chant or call the corners--

1120
01:35:12,886 --> 01:35:13,887
Maybe.

1121
01:35:13,887 --> 01:35:16,887
Hold your breath until I call.

1122
01:35:16,887 --> 01:35:20,888
She probably doesn't have
any powers anyway.

1123
01:35:51,892 --> 01:35:54,893
Be careful.
You don't want to end up like Nancy.

1124
01:36:05,895 --> 01:36:07,895
It's you. It's you.

1125
01:36:09,895 --> 01:36:10,895
He gave me power.

1126
01:36:12,896 --> 01:36:14,896
I can do whatever I want now.

1127
01:36:14,896 --> 01:36:16,896
I can fly.

1128
01:36:19,897 --> 01:36:22,897
He gave you something, honey,
but it ain't the power.

1129
01:36:22,897 --> 01:36:24,898
But I can fly. I am flying.

1130
01:36:24,898 --> 01:36:26,898
I am flying.

1131
01:36:27,898 --> 01:36:29,898
I am flying.

1132
01:36:29,898 --> 01:36:30,910
I am flying.

1133
01:36:35,739 --> 01:36:38,180
I am flying........

1134
01:36:38,594 --> 01:36:39,490
I am flying.

1135
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:44,821
- I am flying. I am flying.
- I am flying.
