2
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:57,170
Do you...

3
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:00,506
Do you not know that your bodies

4
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,442
are temples of the holy spirit?

5
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:08,247
Who is in you.

6
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,817
Whom you have received from God.

7
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:16,624
You, you are not
your own.

8
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:22,696
You were bought, you
were bought at a price.

9
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,866
Therefore, honor God with your
bodies.

10
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,703
There will be terrible
times in the last days.

11
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:33,874
People will be lovers of
themselves, lovers of money.

12
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,343
Boastful.

13
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:38,846
Proud.

14
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,413
Abusive.

15
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:43,784
Treacherous, rash, conceited.

16
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:45,919
Lovers of- lovers of-

17
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:49,155
Lovers of pleasure rather
than lovers of God.

18
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:53,326
Having a form of Godliness
but denying its power

19
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:57,330
Have nothing- have nothing
to do with such people.

20
00:01:57,363 --> 00:02:01,234
They are the kinds who worm their way

21
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:04,905
into homes and gain control
over gullible women.

22
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:12,478
"Therefore, we will
not fear,

23
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,546
though the earth give way

24
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,516
and the mountains fall
into the heart of the sea,

25
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:18,919
though its waters roar and foam

26
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:21,287
and the mountains quake
with their surging.

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,890
Glad the city of God,

28
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:25,525
the holy place where
the Most High dwells."

29
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:39,539
"He breaks the bow and shatters
the spear.

30
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:42,241
He burns the shields with fire.

31
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:50,450
For persecution or famine
or nakedness or sword.

32
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,021
As it is written.

33
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:57,490
For your sake we face death all
day long.

34
00:02:57,523 --> 00:02:59,960
We are considered as
sheep to be slaughtered."

35
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,985
Sordico, the genus
purpiceps.

36
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,627
The dark-purplish buds
on this head of wheat

37
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:17,396
are the so-called sclerotia of
sordico,

38
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,833
from the genus purpiceps.

39
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,539
This indicates the beginning
of the sexual stage...

40
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:33,080
Once winter is over,
the sordico will sprout

41
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,182
to mushroom-like structures,

42
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,751
which will create the sexual
spore stage,

43
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:42,421
which takes place throughout
the spring season.

44
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:45,993
This stage will be discharged

45
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:48,494
from the fruit bodies
by the fungus and dicem-

46
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:52,132
- I've got purpose, Jim,
god damn it.

47
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,534
I've got purpose, Jim, god damn
it.

48
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,741
I've got purpose, god damn it,
Jim.

49
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,011
Give me...

50
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:06,512
Damn it, Jim!

51
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,716
Give me a fucking chance!

52
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:14,021
Damn it, Jim, give me a, give me
a fu-

53
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,454
- After the
infection takes hold,

54
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:18,424
the asexual spore stage is
created.

55
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,828
This is called the purpolia
stage,

56
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:27,701
which creates its spores in a
honeydew-

57
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,037
- A fucking chance!

58
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,139
Just give me a fucking chance!

59
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,745
Poisoning,
caused by sordico of wheat

60
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,248
is referred to as sordicism.

61
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,917
There are two types of
symptoms that can occur

62
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:45,518
in cases of serious poisoning.

63
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:50,523
I've got a purpose.

64
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,625
Gangrenous
sordicism

65
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,194
is common in grazing farm
animals.

66
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,931
It causes gangrene to
occur by constricting

67
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:00,466
the blood vessels that
lead to the extremities.

68
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,071
Convulsive sordicism is
characterized

69
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,139
by disfunction within the
nervous system,

70
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,911
where the animal twists and
contorts its body in pain.

71
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:15,949
Trembling and shaking.

72
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:20,954
Typically, when a bovid
becomes infected by sordico,

73
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:22,521
it must be put down,

74
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,892
and the entire crops from
that season destroyed.

75
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,271
Symptoms of gangrenous
and convulsive sordicism

76
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:42,009
can occur in varying degrees
in any animal or human

77
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:44,778
who has consumed sordico.

78
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,749
In the Middle Ages, unaware of
the risks,

79
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,185
the common folk of Europe
rarely made the effort

80
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,087
to remove the sordico from the
wheat,

81
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:58,058
so the fungal wheat flour was
often baked into the bread.

82
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,629
There are extensive accounts
of these ignorant peasants

83
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:05,032
suffering from burning
sensations in their limbs,

84
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,533
amputations due to gangrene,

85
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,971
dizziness, nausea, and,

86
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:16,977
if consumed over a long period
of time, gradual insanity.

87
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,250
These symptoms were titled Godly
flames,

88
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:29,256
as many considered them
a punishment from God.

89
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:33,026
A tribulation for the sins of
the people.

90
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,093
- Oh, shit.
- What?

91
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:07,727
The fucking GPS lost
service.

92
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,762
Did you mess with it?

93
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,063
What do you
mean, did I mess with it?

94
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:10,931
What are you doing?

95
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:12,732
I think one of the tires
is low.

96
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,868
- The tires don't feel low.
- Just shh.

97
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,236
It's not
supposed to lose direction

98
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,704
where there's no signal.

99
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:18,638
Did you touch it?

100
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,742
It's literally like two
and a half minutes away.

101
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,911
I'll get us there without GPS.

102
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:26,847
That kid is staring at
us.

103
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,782
- What kid?
- On the bike.

104
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:30,016
What the fuck?

105
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:32,853
I'm gonna
ask him for directions.

106
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:33,920
Sam, no.

107
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:35,822
Sam.

108
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:38,758
Hey.

109
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,163
Do you know how to get to
Bardwells Ferry Road from here?

110
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,099
Hello?

111
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:53,807
Rude.

112
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:00,747
Big weirdy weirdo.

113
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:04,751
You definitely
messed with the GPS.

114
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:05,719
Tire's fine.

115
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:10,924
What?

116
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,772
- What just-
- No idea.

117
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,241
No idea.

118
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,927
Pardon my French,

119
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:24,130
but I didn't come all the way
down here

120
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:26,399
to Albuquerque to get fucked.

121
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,869
To get fucked, bucko.

122
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:30,804
Hey, Jim.

123
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,040
Remember that night in Vegas,

124
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:38,979
when we met those two broads at
Caesar's?

125
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,548
Well, there's something I never
told you.

126
00:11:41,582 --> 00:11:43,316
There's somethin'...

127
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:02,596
Hey, Jim.

128
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:05,932
Hey, Jim.

129
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,835
Hey, Jim.

130
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:15,241
I'm sorry and please pardon my
French,

131
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:19,412
but I just get nervous around
cool guys,

132
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:23,651
and when I got on that plane, I
just-

133
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:25,085
- You hate me.

134
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,252
Hm?

135
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,221
I've just been crazy
pre-occupied.

136
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,522
It's fine.

137
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,358
I swear, it's fine.

138
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:35,028
I swear, I swear, I swear.

139
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:35,995
You hate me.

140
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:38,231
Yes.

141
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:42,168
I 100% don't hate you, it's
totally fine.

142
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:43,903
We're both distracted right now.

143
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,211
I repulse you.

144
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:52,680
I totally get it.

145
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,991
Hell of a haunch.

146
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,493
Thanks to you.

147
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,261
Yeah, that's what eating raw

148
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,964
and burning 35,000 calories
a month will get you.

149
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,999
Yeah, that and a stomach full
of acid.

150
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,435
Did you take your-

151
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,070
- Yes!
- All right.

152
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,546
Ow, what the fuck,
Rylie?

153
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,247
Sorry!

154
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,416
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry!

155
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,963
Hello?

156
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:44,964
Hello?

157
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,142
- Hello?
- Hello?

158
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,013
Anybody home?

159
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:02,315
Yeah, what the-

160
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,516
- Shh.

161
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,251
Yeah, who is, who's there?

162
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,622
Sorry if I scared ya.

163
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:09,690
Can we help you?

164
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:14,695
You're on my property.

165
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,513
Oh, great.

166
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:53,634
Sorry if I scared ya!

167
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,070
This is your property?

168
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,774
500 acres.

169
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,476
Between Cedar and Hillside.

170
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,678
Oh, you're kidding.

171
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:11,050
Nope...

172
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,689
Two of you in there?

173
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:19,359
Huh?

174
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:23,797
Are there two of you in
there?

175
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:24,698
Yeah?

176
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,436
So, do we need to pack up?

177
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:33,741
Yeah.

178
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:39,647
All right.

179
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,183
What, what's your name?

180
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:46,219
Eulis.

181
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,387
What, what was that?

182
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,558
Eulis!

183
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:53,326
I, I can't-

184
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,161
- E-U-L-I-S.

185
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,699
Oh, Eulis.

186
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,334
Do you know anything that
might be open this late?

187
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,836
Like a motel or...

188
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,308
Not right in town that I can
think of.

189
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,580
There might be something further
north.

190
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:26,192
Might be something further
north.

191
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:29,429
Okay.

192
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,296
Thanks.

193
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,670
I'll come back around,
next couple hours.

194
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:39,172
Make sure you're outta here.

195
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,140
Yeah, we'll be out in a bit.

196
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:43,309
Make sure to douse that fire.

197
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:44,510
Yeah, will do!

198
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,782
Get home safe.

199
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:51,652
Yeah, thank you.

200
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:15,643
We're probably gonna have
to drive out a couple miles

201
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:16,877
before we get any service,

202
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,412
but I think I can get
us into town on my own.

203
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:31,925
Nope.

204
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,396
Fucking nope.

205
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,197
Sam.

206
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:39,198
Fucking nope!

207
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:39,967
Sam!

208
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,668
Did you leave the hazards on?

209
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:42,268
Did I leave the hazards on?

210
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:47,373
Once we get to the main road
that should bring us into town.

211
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,509
Worst case, we call AAA from
there.

212
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,411
Be home by five AM.

213
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:52,813
As long as that's the
worst case.

214
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:54,347
Oh, that's the spirit.

215
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:58,351
I have 47% battery, how much do
you have?

216
00:18:58,384 --> 00:18:59,053
30.

217
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,421
- Is it on low power?
- Yes.

218
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,356
- All other apps-
- All apps are off.

219
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:04,725
Brightness all the way
down?

220
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:06,426
Whoa, what the...

221
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,434
Jesus Christ.

222
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,736
What the fuck?

223
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:30,316
We couldn't just do a nice day
hike, nope.

224
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,952
Will you just give it a rest,
Sam?

225
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,822
Just, will you shut up?

226
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,558
- Excuse me?
- Just shut up.

227
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,250
Wait.

228
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:05,853
Sam?

229
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,490
It's okay, I forgive you!

230
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,390
Idiot.

231
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,595
Nice.

232
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,696
- Look.
- What?

233
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:18,732
There.

234
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:22,603
What, the light?

235
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:24,838
No, the darkness surrounding
the light.

236
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:27,875
God, come on.

237
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,869
Coochie coochie coo!

238
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:03,844
Oh, my god, Sam.

239
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:07,380
God, you're really something
tonight.

240
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:08,749
I'm something tonight?

241
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,360
- Not to mention the five-
- Shh!

242
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:24,097
- If you shush me one more-
- Just shh!

243
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,374
What's that smell?

244
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:39,713
- Hi!
- Oh, hi there.

245
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:40,848
Hi.

246
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,082
We're so sorry to bother you.

247
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:46,385
We were just wondering if we
could maybe borrow your phone?

248
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,455
See, we were camping a little
ways in, near the wheat fields

249
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:52,425
and the land owner told
us that we had to leave.

250
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,027
Oh, my goodness.

251
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:57,530
Yeah, so we were all set to
drive home,

252
00:21:57,564 --> 00:22:00,033
and then our car wouldn't
start and we weren't able

253
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,835
to track down any cell service.

254
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:15,949
So, we were wondering if
maybe we could use your phone

255
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:17,885
to call AAA for a jump?

256
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,090
Hi, I'm Sam.

257
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:24,157
Hi, Sam.

258
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:31,198
Should...

259
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:33,667
Oh, please, please!

260
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,702
Where are my manners?

261
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:37,738
Ah, thank you so much.

262
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:39,072
Thank you so much.

263
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:41,141
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

264
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,111
- I'm Karen.
- Hi, Karen.

265
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:50,449
AAA won't do you any good over
here.

266
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:55,856
Take 'em two-three hours just to
get here.

267
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,891
Not worth it just for a jump.

268
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:04,231
Now, my neighbor, Pete, he
could be here in 30 minutes.

269
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:06,633
Settle for a T-bone steak

270
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,970
and a glass of milk for
compensation.

271
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,239
Wouldn't have to spend a nickel.

272
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,206
That'd be great.

273
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,876
Are you sure that he's
awake? It's already-

274
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:16,977
- Pete?

275
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,211
Karen.

276
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,214
I've got a sweet couple here.

277
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:23,684
Had their camping trip wrecked

278
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:26,553
by some scum sucker over by...

279
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:29,156
Did you get his name?

280
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,191
Eulis.

281
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:32,759
You-us?

282
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:33,660
Eulis.

283
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:36,863
E-U-L-I-S.

284
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:39,166
Oh, Eulis.

285
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,500
You know a, a Eulis?

286
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:44,671
Eulis.

287
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:46,773
Eulis!

288
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:52,946
Oh, okay.

289
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,847
Okay.

290
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:56,515
Okay.

291
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:59,619
So I'll see you in a bit.

292
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:02,089
See ya in a bit!

293
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,559
And if you've got your teeth in,

294
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:09,196
I'll fix ya a cut and a fresh
loaf.

295
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:12,699
All right, my dear.

296
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,543
Did he say how long he might
be?

297
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:25,812
Eulis?

298
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:26,847
Pete.

299
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,981
Oh!

300
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:29,649
Pete.

301
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:33,854
- We don't wanna overstay.
- Oh, please, please, please.

302
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:37,157
He shouldn't be more than 30
minutes.

303
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:41,762
Worst case, 45, since he's
gettin' on.

304
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:43,997
No, that's great, that's
perfect.

305
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:49,136
Perfect.

306
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:08,355
Again, thank you so...

307
00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:11,825
Oh, my goodness!

308
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:15,028
Where are my manners?

309
00:25:15,062 --> 00:25:16,930
You two must be stravin'!

310
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:17,631
Actually, a little.

311
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:19,166
Actually, I think we're fine.

312
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:21,168
Oh, you're a couple of sticks.

313
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,937
Come on, come on!

314
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,672
Come on, Rylie.

315
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:26,573
You're a stick.

316
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:43,957
Oh dear, oh dear.

317
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:47,761
I always overshoot at low heat.

318
00:25:51,264 --> 00:25:54,267
Is there any spinach in the
house?

319
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:42,916
It gets so hot when I cook,
so I leave it open.

320
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,117
Have a seat!

321
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,057
Hello.

322
00:26:57,164 --> 00:26:58,031
Hi.

323
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,912
Please!

324
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:15,315
Sit down.

325
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:19,152
Have somethin' for ya in 10-15
minutes.

326
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,093
You like steak?

327
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:30,730
Oh, Sam is actually off
red meat as of recently, so-

328
00:27:30,764 --> 00:27:32,832
- Well, I, I-
- How do you like 'em?

329
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:35,735
No, I'm sorry, he's
actually off red meat.

330
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:39,806
I had a physical a few months
ago

331
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,808
and my cholesterol is not great.

332
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:43,276
It's 270, actually.

333
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,812
- Doctor suggested that I-
- He can't have any red meat.

334
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:48,481
Any dairy, sugar, salt.

335
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:50,417
Maybe a little piece of
chicken once a month, but that-

336
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,985
- A quarter chicken once a
month.

337
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,220
- He suggested-
- You can't have it.

338
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:54,454
Bless you.

339
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:01,194
And I'm actually a
vegan, believe it or not.

340
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:13,240
Oh, boy.

341
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:17,277
I take a three and a half,
but an eight feels so good.

342
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,079
I've gotta get 12s.

343
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,351
Oh, perfect.

344
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:30,423
Do you need some help?

345
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:32,392
- Where's your restroom?
- What?

346
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:34,562
Take a left out of the
kitchen,

347
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:36,296
then a right before the stairs.

348
00:29:56,976 --> 00:29:59,346
So, were you at all
affected by the sordico?

349
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:05,852
Karen?

350
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:14,094
- Hey, Karen?
- What's that, dear?

351
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,096
Were you
affected by the sordico,

352
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,130
a little while back?

353
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:19,132
The sordico?

354
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:22,068
The cattle deaths, from
the Sordico of wheat?

355
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:24,070
Oh, right, right.

356
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:27,006
The sordico.

357
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,275
How do you know about all that?

358
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:31,411
I'm getting my doctorate in
botany.

359
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:36,049
I'm doing my thesis
project on the resurgence

360
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:38,118
of sordico in New England crops

361
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:41,154
and their life cycle in
this particular climate.

362
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,261
Must've really disrupted
the industry over here.

363
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:50,463
At least the meat trade.

364
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:52,031
Oh, sure, sure.

365
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:57,437
We were one of the top meat and
wheat farmers in the county.

366
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,538
Wow, really?

367
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,710
Now we trade with the farmer
nearby.

368
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:07,013
Our veggies for his meat and
grain.

369
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:09,717
Have you ever considered
moving?

370
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:20,427
You like cardamom?

371
00:31:22,162 --> 00:31:23,029
Love it.

372
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:47,053
Would you
like me if I wore a uniform?

373
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:33,500
Great bread.

374
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:49,717
So, is that your daughter

375
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,619
in those pictures in the hall,
Karen?

376
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,403
Sorry.

377
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:12,171
Did something happen?

378
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:15,475
I love Christmas music.

379
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:35,361
So, is Pete pretty close, you
think?

380
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:39,165
- Sam, would you like some-
- Hey, Karen?

381
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,468
You think that Pete is pretty
close?

382
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:47,641
That's 15 minutes
fast.

383
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,244
Wouldn't say more than another
30.

384
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:52,412
He's gettin' on.

385
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,355
He may look like a chunky monkey
now,

386
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:05,358
but he used to come in at an
even 400.

387
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,894
Who's that, Pete?

388
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:07,795
Gunni.

389
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:10,196
My son.

390
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:13,499
Got kicked.

391
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:16,536
By a bull, about six months ago.

392
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,738
Right in the face.

393
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,139
Hasn't been the same.

394
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:22,810
God, I'm sorry.

395
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:28,514
Oh.

396
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:32,218
A little butter won't hurt him.

397
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:35,355
Thank you.

398
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:39,727
Left, right, left, right,
left, right.

399
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,862
- So, what do you do, Sam?
- Well, I'm, uh-

400
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:43,363
- He's an actor.

401
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:44,832
Oh, really?

402
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:46,834
- Waiter/actor.
- Actor/waiter.

403
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,602
In between waiting jobs.

404
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,738
He's just getting too many
auditions.

405
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:51,605
Can never remember the
specials.

406
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,941
I've got the same problem with
scripts.

407
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:59,178
Well, this weekend, he's
my research assistant.

408
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:07,921
Was that your bear trap out in
the woods?

409
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,463
Hey, Karen?

410
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:21,367
Just a nib, Goon
buggy.

411
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:23,737
Oh, come on, buggy boy, just a
peck.

412
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:29,576
Just a peck.

413
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:45,451
Room for dessert?

414
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:48,722
Whole tray of cupcakes in the
fridge.

415
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:50,557
Baked 'em yesterday!

416
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:57,865
Oh, I'm stuffed.

417
00:36:57,898 --> 00:36:59,365
Yeah, me too, thank you.

418
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:40,574
Oh, Sam.

419
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:41,742
Tea?

420
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,118
Sorry again, about Pete.

421
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:55,923
He tends to fall asleep,
just outta nowhere.

422
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,127
Even in the middle of
conversations, sometimes.

423
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,095
- Like a narcoleptic?
- Nope.

424
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,767
You know, we really
don't mind just calling for-

425
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,771
- Oh and if you get a
hankerin' for anything,

426
00:38:10,804 --> 00:38:12,505
go back upstairs!

427
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:15,909
There's plenty of leftov-.

428
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,345
That's our dog, Earl.

429
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:21,648
We keep him in the barn, a
little ways in.

430
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:27,120
Bad with people.

431
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:34,527
There's no, uh, online or
phone service over here,

432
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:37,463
but if you're desperate,

433
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:41,134
you might try a little
further in, that a way.

434
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,905
Cellular phone wise.

435
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:50,476
I think some sorta
tower might reach there.

436
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:52,946
Oh, I think we'll be all
right.

437
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,916
Gunni usually sleeps down
here.

438
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:58,118
I'll keep him up with me
tonight.

439
00:38:58,151 --> 00:38:59,452
Are you sure?

440
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:04,490
You know, maybe we should
just...

441
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:10,197
Come in, come in!

442
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,131
Right this way.

443
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:13,166
Sam.

444
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:18,839
Right this way.

445
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,882
Got your own bathroom back
there.

446
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:32,152
You even have a TV.

447
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:34,554
Think we had a couple of...

448
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:52,873
Oh!

449
00:39:58,278 --> 00:40:01,214
We really appreciate
your hospitality, Karen.

450
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:02,883
You've really saved our butts.

451
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:09,957
♪ Oh my honey, yes, oh my honey,
yes ♪

452
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:14,561

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,782
I'll call Pete, first thing.

457
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:39,553
If he doesn't haul over in 15,

458
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,890
I'll snag his cables myself.

459
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:47,160
- We really appreciate it.
- Yeah, thanks again, Karen.

460
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:53,200

Ah, shoot.

468
00:44:14,034 --> 00:44:14,901
Sam.

469
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:17,871
Sam?

470
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:21,074
Samuel.

471
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:29,182
Why are you getting dressed?

472
00:44:31,451 --> 00:44:32,819
What, are you leaving?

473
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,225
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

474
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:34,381
Oh, mama.

475
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:12,379
Window cleaner!

476
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:29,329
Window cleaner!

477
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:40,073
Oh, Jesus.

478
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,314
Jesus.

479
00:48:00,427 --> 00:48:03,296
Oh, lord.

480
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:41,367
Jesus!

481
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:54,414
Gunni.

482
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,487
You scared me.

483
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:42,630
You keep a secret?

484
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:55,241
I haven't had a grain of salt
in more than three months.

485
00:49:58,646 --> 00:49:59,512
I know.

486
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:06,687
No red meat, no pink meat.

487
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:11,224
The occasional fish.

488
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:15,696
No complex sugars.

489
00:50:17,565 --> 00:50:19,132
No complex carbs.

490
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,334
No starches.

491
00:50:24,537 --> 00:50:26,406
No high-fructose corn syrup.

492
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:42,522
No refined vegetable oil.

493
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:45,358
Or sodium benzoate.

494
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,595
No butane.

495
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,863
Did you know they put
butane in chicken nuggets?

496
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:52,866
No chicken nuggets.

497
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:13,621
Whoa.

498
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:21,427
You all right?

499
00:51:21,461 --> 00:51:25,231
Dah... mah...

500
00:51:25,264 --> 00:51:26,499
...Chalk.

501
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:34,173
Das...

502
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,544
Mah... chalk.

503
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:39,445
Sorry?

504
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:46,185
My.

505
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,388
Chalk.

506
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,595
I'm sorry, I can't...

507
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:55,495
That's magic?

508
00:51:58,699 --> 00:51:59,566
That's.

509
00:52:01,534 --> 00:52:02,368
My.

510
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,238
Chalk!

511
00:52:43,644 --> 00:52:44,510
What?

512
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:55,983
Yeah?

513
00:54:01,454 --> 00:54:02,089
Sam?

514
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:10,463
Come on, Sam.

515
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:14,500
I swear to fucking god.

516
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,077
Sam, consider the consequences.

517
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:32,753
Sam!

518
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,403
Stop this shit or I'm
breaking up with you!

519
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:04,017
Sam, I can't tell you how
unfunny you are.

520
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,503
Come on, Sam, just tell me if
it's you.

521
00:55:39,686 --> 00:55:41,154
Sam?

522
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:20,994
We need to talk.

523
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:27,668
Well, you know it's cooked,
Jimbo.

524
00:56:28,936 --> 00:56:30,503
It's just still in the thing.

525
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:33,472
So don't throw any stones.

526
00:56:33,506 --> 00:56:35,108
I've got plenty of license here.

527
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:38,477
Or baked, or whatever.

528
00:56:39,545 --> 00:56:41,648
Whatever you do, take your
fucking time.

529
00:56:42,548 --> 00:56:43,817
- We need to talk.
- What?

530
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:48,021
God, what would you do if
this place was on fire, huh?

531
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:50,958
I feel bad enough about this.

532
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:56,797
I'm serious, what would you do?

533
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,165
I'd probably be quicker about-

534
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:00,834
- I don't think you would.

535
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,703
I really don't think you would.

536
00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:04,071
They found a lump.

537
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:07,140
A what? A what?

538
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,709
A lump.

539
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,510
Oh, cripes.

540
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:14,681
Oh, cripes.

541
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:18,618
Where?

542
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:19,786
In your tum tum.

543
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:32,766
Window washer.

544
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:33,967
Of course.

545
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,035
Of course.

546
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,171
This is so predictable.

547
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,040
I have zero appetite.

548
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:41,875
Is this place open?

549
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:47,581
What's gonna happen to him?

550
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:48,281
Shh!

551
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:52,886
It's just there are moments

552
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:55,255
hanging in the ether that could
be mine.

553
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:57,124
Oh, for Christ sake.

554
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,600
Oh, shoot.

555
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,735
It really
isn't as bad as it looks,

556
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:09,870
and to be honest,

557
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:13,807
I think you're being a little
bit of a Letdown Larry.

558
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:17,244
Oh, I can't talk to you right
now.

559
00:59:26,379 --> 00:59:28,148
"For Chrissake.

560
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:29,649
For Christ's sake.

561
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,723
I've got purpose."

562
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:41,862
What a piece of shit.

563
00:59:50,904 --> 00:59:51,771
I love you!

564
00:59:58,111 --> 00:59:58,979
Rylie?

565
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:08,889
Rylie?

566
01:00:16,429 --> 01:00:17,297
Rylie?

567
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,072
Rylie?

568
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:31,678
Rylie?

569
01:00:36,183 --> 01:00:37,050
Rylie?

570
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:43,456
Karen?

571
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:01,808
Karen?

572
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,326
Karen?

573
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,158
Gunni?

574
01:02:59,893 --> 01:03:00,561
Gunni!

575
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:06,032
Hey, Gunni, open the door!

576
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:10,337
Hey!

577
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,237
Gunni!

578
01:03:13,073 --> 01:03:13,940
Hey!

579
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:16,343
What're you doin' out here, man?

580
01:03:18,144 --> 01:03:19,245
Hey, open the door!

581
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,316
Hey, Gunni!

582
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:28,355
Where's your mom, bud?

583
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,389
Hey, Gunni, come on!

584
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:32,892
Let's go, we'll go inside!

585
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:39,132
God damn it, Gunni!

586
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:46,973
Hello?

587
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:50,210
Rylie?

588
01:03:54,381 --> 01:03:55,248
Rylie!

589
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,619
Rylie!

590
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,187
Rylie!

591
01:04:04,023 --> 01:04:04,891
Hello?

592
01:04:52,439 --> 01:04:53,574
Come on, come on, come on.

593
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:56,042
911, what's your
emergency?

594
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:59,613
Hi, yes I'm calling
about a girl who's gone missing.

595
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:02,683
My girlfriend just disappeared.

596
01:05:02,716 --> 01:05:05,051
- We're staying with this woman-
- What's the address, sir?

597
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:07,454
Yeah, I think it's,
uh, it's Cormorant Way

598
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,322
between, um, I think

599
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:12,593
between Pleasant Street and
Trouble Street, I believe.

600
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:14,994
I'm going to
need an exact address, sir.

601
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:18,264
Okay, yeah, I don't
know, it's a white house.

602
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:20,266
Sir, I'm gonna
nee...

603
01:05:22,035 --> 01:05:22,703
Hello?

604
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:25,338
Fuck!

605
01:08:36,997 --> 01:08:39,967
Do you not know that
your bodies

606
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,670
are temples of the holy spirit?

607
01:08:43,804 --> 01:08:44,938
Who is in you.

608
01:08:46,974 --> 01:08:50,443
Whom you have received from God.

609
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:51,344
You.

610
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:54,915
You are not your own.

611
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,451
You were bought.

612
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:02,656
You were bought at a price.

613
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:05,826
Therefore, honor God with your
bodies.

614
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,631
There will be terrible
times in the last days.

615
01:09:10,664 --> 01:09:13,232
People will be lovers of
themselves.

616
01:09:14,768 --> 01:09:16,235
Lovers of money.

617
01:09:17,638 --> 01:09:18,504
Boastful.

618
01:09:19,472 --> 01:09:20,339
Proud.

619
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:22,676
Abusive.

620
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:27,948
Treacherous, rash, conceited.

621
01:09:29,016 --> 01:09:34,220
Lovers of, lovers of the planet
rather than lovers of God.

622
01:09:36,824 --> 01:09:40,359
Having a form of Godliness
but denying its power

623
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:44,598
Having nothing, have nothing
to do with such people.

624
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:49,435
There are kinds who worm their way

625
01:09:49,469 --> 01:09:54,273
into homes and gain control
over gullible women.

626
01:10:32,946 --> 01:10:34,280
Rylie.

627
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:42,823
What's going on?

628
01:10:42,856 --> 01:10:44,691
Are you okay?

629
01:12:28,128 --> 01:12:29,528
Don't get up.

630
01:12:32,498 --> 01:12:33,166
Karen.

631
01:12:35,068 --> 01:12:35,936
Karen.

632
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:39,172
What's, what's going on?

633
01:13:04,497 --> 01:13:09,502
Goodness gracious

634
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:22,515
Karen!

635
01:14:06,293 --> 01:14:07,160
Rylie.

636
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:11,164
Sam.

637
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:18,271
We are livin' in a...

638
01:14:19,272 --> 01:14:22,175
Livin' in a time of tribulation.

639
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,946
Eul', darnit with that!

640
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:30,150
To put it simply.

641
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:36,223
We have perverted God's divine
love,

642
01:14:36,256 --> 01:14:38,725
through abuse of his gifts.

643
01:14:40,827 --> 01:14:43,830
We were overindulgent in God's
feed,

644
01:14:45,866 --> 01:14:48,335
and so he took it away.

645
01:14:48,368 --> 01:14:52,039
Forcing us to seek a
more immediate source,

646
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:56,643
so that he may not forsake
us in the end times,

647
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:02,149
which, my babies, are
nearer than you may think.

648
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:09,656
But we have been given an
opportunity for absolution.

649
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:16,196
A second chance to sustain life
entirely

650
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:19,633
through consumption of what we
can access

651
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:23,904
of our own flesh and available
earth,

652
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:26,740
so we may be judged in his
image.

653
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:30,977
Now, that's what I call mercy.

654
01:15:32,312 --> 01:15:33,246
So...

655
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,185
Came up with a sorta
redemption-type program.

656
01:15:39,653 --> 01:15:41,254
A rationing effort.

657
01:15:42,222 --> 01:15:47,227
We've had a number of
participants

658
01:15:47,894 --> 01:15:49,329
over the years.

659
01:15:50,931 --> 01:15:53,633
I think we've worked out all the
kinks.

660
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:56,236
Just about.

661
01:15:57,370 --> 01:16:02,342
This little sweetheart's
been with us for a while now.

662
01:16:11,184 --> 01:16:14,688
If there was ever someone
who needed a good sortin'...

663
01:16:18,024 --> 01:16:21,161
Quite the pig.

664
01:16:21,194 --> 01:16:23,430
But from his gluttony,

665
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:26,133
we were blessed with two cheeks

666
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,402
and a beefy round.

667
01:16:30,605 --> 01:16:34,808
He's also taught us a heck
of a lot about perseverance.

668
01:16:36,376 --> 01:16:41,381
And loyalty.

669
01:16:44,484 --> 01:16:48,054
And now that we're done with his
bottom,

670
01:16:49,289 --> 01:16:51,358
we gotta take from the top.

671
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:02,362
You've probably been wonderin'

672
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:07,334
what the heck is in
this thing.

673
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:29,856
This is our daughter.

674
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:32,058
My god.

675
01:18:32,092 --> 01:18:33,026
Delilah.

676
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,172
She's given us just about
everything

677
01:18:46,206 --> 01:18:48,541
she's got over the years.

678
01:18:48,576 --> 01:18:51,244
A true model of self-sacrifice.

679
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,782
Come on, girlie.

680
01:19:06,126 --> 01:19:11,131
Oh.

681
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,009
All right, all right.

682
01:19:23,043 --> 01:19:25,245
I'm honin' in on breakfast.

683
01:19:27,615 --> 01:19:29,082
Oh, okay, honey.

684
01:19:30,584 --> 01:19:34,854
It's on its way, my love.

685
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:47,167
Ah, that's her language.

686
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,301
That blinkin'?

687
01:19:48,335 --> 01:19:50,638
She's sayin' "feed me, darn it!

688
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:54,874
Feed me that's boy's sweet rear
end."

689
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:07,420
Let's get this old girl fed.

690
01:20:07,454 --> 01:20:08,321
Shall we?

691
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:15,895
See how you compare to Buggy
Boy.

692
01:20:16,996 --> 01:20:18,431
Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy
gifts,

693
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:20,133
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty.

694
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:24,137
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

695
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,378
There you go.

696
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:37,317
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

697
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:39,018
Slow down, darlin'.

698
01:20:41,121 --> 01:20:45,959
She's like, "where the hell's
this been all my life?"

699
01:20:45,992 --> 01:20:49,195
Oh, mama mia!

700
01:20:57,437 --> 01:21:00,373
Yum, yum, yum, gimme, gimme,
gimme.

701
01:21:02,308 --> 01:21:03,543
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

702
01:21:03,577 --> 01:21:05,478
Pace yourself, darlin'.

703
01:21:12,653 --> 01:21:14,988
Grade-A prime cut, Samuel.

704
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,643
All right.

705
01:21:35,676 --> 01:21:37,343
That'll do for now.

706
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:28,428
Made from all the brightest
suns of the Universe.

707
01:22:29,362 --> 01:22:31,030
And volumes beyond.

708
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:03,396
You better believe we're
still aimin' for grand babies.

709
01:23:06,366 --> 01:23:08,802
Bring some sunshine into this
black world.

710
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:13,674
Goon here seems to be working
with an empty cartridge.

711
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:23,283
There's another little piece
here, babies.

712
01:23:25,485 --> 01:23:26,352
Goon bug?

713
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,122
Gunni?

714
01:23:30,658 --> 01:23:31,524
Gunni!

715
01:23:33,894 --> 01:23:36,529
One more little piece.

716
01:23:37,765 --> 01:23:42,603
Eulis here was the go-to farm
vet, once upon a sometime.

717
01:23:43,536 --> 01:23:46,472
He performs all our procedures.

718
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:49,777
We have a little,

719
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:52,145
little sorta security system.

720
01:24:05,258 --> 01:24:06,125
Eulis?

721
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:10,496
Eulis.

722
01:24:15,168 --> 01:24:15,836
Eulis?

723
01:24:18,672 --> 01:24:19,539
Eulis.

724
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,409
I've got money.

725
01:24:27,347 --> 01:24:28,548
I've got money.

726
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:33,486
Money, I have got money.

727
01:24:40,928 --> 01:24:42,195
Money, money, money.

728
01:24:55,441 --> 01:24:57,343
Eulis, please.

729
01:24:57,377 --> 01:25:00,781
Please, please.

730
01:25:00,814 --> 01:25:03,483
- Eulis, come on.
- Shh, shh, shh.

731
01:25:04,918 --> 01:25:05,819
Turn it up, Goon.

732
01:25:09,757 --> 01:25:10,691
Goon bug?

733
01:25:14,293 --> 01:25:16,864
Eulis.

734
01:25:16,897 --> 01:25:17,765
Eulis.

735
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,901
Please, Eulis, please.

736
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:24,672
This is an
orbitoclast.

737
01:25:29,475 --> 01:25:32,579
Wasn't an entirely unpopular way
of

738
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:37,517
giving people an overhaul, at
one time.

739
01:25:39,019 --> 01:25:40,888
Please, Eulis, don't do this.

740
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:42,455
I'll do anything.

741
01:25:43,356 --> 01:25:44,992
Eulis, I'll do anything.

742
01:25:45,025 --> 01:25:47,828
Can't guarantee you
won't try to run off.

743
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:49,195
Oh, look at Gunni there.

744
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:53,767
Sweet as a baby chipmunk, and
happy, too.

745
01:25:54,835 --> 01:25:55,703
Truly.

746
01:25:56,536 --> 01:25:58,839
You're not gonna feel a damn
thing.

747
01:25:58,872 --> 01:26:00,641
Well, a little pressure, maybe.

748
01:26:00,674 --> 01:26:03,543
Then it's bright eyes and sweet
smile.

749
01:26:04,611 --> 01:26:06,647
Not gonna make this
any easier,

750
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,548
whippin' around, Pork Chop.

751
01:26:08,582 --> 01:26:10,918
No more strainin', Sam.

752
01:26:10,951 --> 01:26:14,287
Not one more wracked nerve,
darlin'.

753
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,426
Eulis!

754
01:26:21,862 --> 01:26:22,863
Come on!

755
01:26:23,897 --> 01:26:27,668
Bright eyes and sweet smiles.

756
01:26:28,969 --> 01:26:32,873
No, no!

757
01:26:32,906 --> 01:26:36,309
Bright eyes and sweet
smiles.

758
01:26:44,885 --> 01:26:45,753
Shit.

759
01:26:49,388 --> 01:26:50,958
- Help!
- Help!

760
01:26:50,991 --> 01:26:52,559
Help!

761
01:26:52,593 --> 01:26:53,594
- Help!
- Help!

762
01:26:54,695 --> 01:26:55,896
- Help!
- Help!

763
01:26:55,929 --> 01:26:57,064
You shut it.

764
01:26:57,097 --> 01:26:58,464
You shut it!

765
01:26:58,498 --> 01:26:59,733
- Help!
- Help!

766
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:01,668
You shut it, or she
gets it!

767
01:27:02,535 --> 01:27:03,904
Hey, fellas.

768
01:27:03,937 --> 01:27:06,372
You shut it, or she gets it.

769
01:27:10,343 --> 01:27:11,678
So help me, God.

770
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,759
One more squeak,

771
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:30,329
and she'll pop him, right
between the peepers.

772
01:27:47,714 --> 01:27:51,417
Yeah, no, it's
been a pretty good year.

773
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:53,954
Well, it's good to see ya.
It's always good to see ya.

774
01:27:53,987 --> 01:27:55,354
Yeah, yeah.

775
01:27:55,388 --> 01:27:58,025
...come and check it
out.

776
01:28:01,795 --> 01:28:02,863
Hey, Gunni.

777
01:28:08,902 --> 01:28:09,770
Gunni.

778
01:28:11,705 --> 01:28:12,906
Gunni, come on.

779
01:28:13,874 --> 01:28:16,342
Gunni, take off my mask.

780
01:28:19,746 --> 01:28:22,149
Gunni, go up the stairs.

781
01:28:22,182 --> 01:28:23,717
Take off my mask.

782
01:28:32,893 --> 01:28:37,396
Take off my mask, yeah, yeah.

783
01:28:43,704 --> 01:28:45,572
Gunni, take off her mask.

784
01:28:45,606 --> 01:28:46,707
Yeah.

785
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,909
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
01:28:50,777 --> 01:28:52,846
Yeah, that's good, Gunni.

787
01:28:54,214 --> 01:28:56,449
Gunni, listen to me.

788
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:59,620
Take the tape off our wrists.

789
01:29:01,554 --> 01:29:02,756
Un-tape our hands.

790
01:29:06,226 --> 01:29:07,094
Yeah.

791
01:29:10,998 --> 01:29:12,933
Oh, my god, good.

792
01:29:12,966 --> 01:29:13,967
Good, Gunni.

793
01:29:15,002 --> 01:29:16,069
That's great.

794
01:29:18,872 --> 01:29:19,740
Yeah.

795
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:22,643
Now, Gunni, listen to me.

796
01:29:23,677 --> 01:29:25,178
Listen to me, Gunni.

797
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:26,479
Cut the tape.

798
01:29:35,822 --> 01:29:37,523
Gunni, Gunni.

799
01:29:37,557 --> 01:29:38,491
Look at me.

800
01:29:40,027 --> 01:29:43,030
Pull out the knife and cut the
tape.

801
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:45,699
Yeah.

802
01:29:46,767 --> 01:29:47,634
Yeah.

803
01:29:48,602 --> 01:29:49,535
Right here.

804
01:29:50,737 --> 01:29:51,738
Good.

805
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:54,808
Yeah.

806
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,747
Quicker.

807
01:30:02,015 --> 01:30:04,084
That's it, that's it.

808
01:30:04,117 --> 01:30:04,985
Yeah.

809
01:30:13,026 --> 01:30:15,095
That's good, that's good.

810
01:30:16,263 --> 01:30:17,631
Yeah, yeah.

811
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:20,267
That's great, Gunni.

812
01:30:25,205 --> 01:30:26,907
That's a good boy.

813
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,875
Help her.

814
01:30:28,909 --> 01:30:32,012
Help Rylie.

815
01:30:45,158 --> 01:30:47,260
Get home safe.

816
01:30:49,763 --> 01:30:51,665
- Take care.
- Uh-huh.

817
01:30:58,939 --> 01:30:59,806
Gunni!

818
01:31:02,009 --> 01:31:03,610
Go, Gunni!

819
01:31:05,045 --> 01:31:05,912
Gunni!

820
01:31:07,347 --> 01:31:08,547
Gunni, go!

821
01:31:09,316 --> 01:31:10,183
Gunni.

822
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:12,719
Drop her, darlin'.

823
01:31:19,259 --> 01:31:20,127
Gunni!

824
01:31:21,228 --> 01:31:22,629
Go!

825
01:31:22,662 --> 01:31:23,529
Now!

826
01:31:24,664 --> 01:31:25,565
Gunni!

827
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,875
Go get the truck!

828
01:31:34,908 --> 01:31:36,043
Get the truck!

829
01:33:05,398 --> 01:33:06,700
Gunni!

830
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:13,840
Gunni!

831
01:33:26,987 --> 01:33:27,854
Gunni.

832
01:36:19,959 --> 01:36:22,630
Calling cars
four, three, two, one.

833
01:36:22,663 --> 01:36:26,299
Calling cars four, three, two,
one.

834
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:27,500
Oh.

835
01:37:08,341 --> 01:37:12,011
I wanna see the bottom of that
plate when I come back up.

836
01:37:14,514 --> 01:37:19,352
Mm, yes.

837
01:38:03,496 --> 01:38:05,566
Oh, my goodness gracious.

838
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:34,227
"I don't know," I said.

839
01:38:35,128 --> 01:38:39,365
"Stop asking me so many
questions, for cripes sake."

840
01:38:49,677 --> 01:38:52,145
Oh.

841
01:38:57,383 --> 01:38:59,519
"Ah, how can you tell a thing
like that

842
01:38:59,552 --> 01:39:02,656
about a person who's
just standing around?"

843
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:03,557
I said.

844
01:39:07,761 --> 01:39:09,229
Hi, Sam.

845
01:39:15,068 --> 01:39:16,035
Lunch time.

846
01:39:19,305 --> 01:39:24,310
Let's start with the
yuckies first, shall we?

847
01:39:24,778 --> 01:39:26,412
Get those out of the way.

848
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:31,117
Open up, darlin'.

849
01:39:31,150 --> 01:39:32,352
Come on.

850
01:39:32,385 --> 01:39:34,420
Just like Popeye.

851
01:39:39,325 --> 01:39:40,828
Oh.

852
01:39:40,861 --> 01:39:45,098
Come on now, Sammy boy.

853
01:39:45,131 --> 01:39:46,834
Open up, sweetie.

854
01:39:46,867 --> 01:39:49,135
Come on, my love.

855
01:39:49,168 --> 01:39:52,071
Just a bite to start.

856
01:40:04,484 --> 01:40:05,351
Come on.

857
01:40:07,253 --> 01:40:12,258
You've gotta eat or
you'll turn into a stick.

858
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:17,497
Well.

859
01:40:19,132 --> 01:40:24,103
We'll just get Li Li started
on the goodies, then.

860
01:40:27,273 --> 01:40:29,710
Here it comes.

861
01:40:29,743 --> 01:40:31,210
Here it comes!

862
01:40:46,894 --> 01:40:49,830
If we start with the goodies
first,

863
01:40:50,831 --> 01:40:54,334
you promise to eat every
last leaf on that plate.

864
01:40:59,573 --> 01:41:01,240
Well, let me hear "yes, mom."

865
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:03,476
Let me hear.

866
01:41:05,946 --> 01:41:07,280
"Yes, mom."

867
01:41:14,955 --> 01:41:17,791
Yaaaaaaa

868
01:41:19,627 --> 01:41:21,595
Maaaaaa.

869
01:41:21,629 --> 01:41:23,764
Aww.

870
01:41:30,536 --> 01:41:33,539
Oh.

871
01:41:33,574 --> 01:41:37,243
Tough today.

872
01:41:37,276 --> 01:41:38,679
Like shoe leather.

873
01:41:40,446 --> 01:41:42,215
Oh, gosh.

874
01:41:50,289 --> 01:41:51,391
Oh.

875
01:41:51,424 --> 01:41:55,361
See, now this bit isn't so
tough.

876
01:42:02,569 --> 01:42:06,239
Now, for the extra yummies.

877
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:09,175
There we go.

878
01:42:33,299 --> 01:42:35,468
"Just stop Sis'," I said.

879
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:37,738
Let's take a
little break from the grub.

880
01:42:37,771 --> 01:42:38,972
"Just stop."

881
01:42:39,006 --> 01:42:40,908
For just a tick.

882
01:42:47,014 --> 01:42:48,916
That's it.

883
01:42:53,687 --> 01:42:57,858
Okay, my beautiful girl.

884
01:42:57,891 --> 01:43:01,695
Come here, my sweet one.

885
01:43:01,729 --> 01:43:04,330
Come here, my lovely.

886
01:43:04,363 --> 01:43:06,299
Yes.

887
01:43:06,332 --> 01:43:07,868
There we go.

888
01:43:09,335 --> 01:43:12,271
There we go.

889
01:43:12,305 --> 01:43:14,875
My beautiful, beautiful girl.

890
01:43:37,898 --> 01:43:41,668
Just relax, babies.

891
01:43:41,702 --> 01:43:44,337
Oh, just relax.

892
01:43:46,974 --> 01:43:50,443
Make room for the Lord.

893
01:43:50,476 --> 01:43:53,346
Breathe him in.

894
01:43:53,379 --> 01:43:56,282
Breathe him in.

895
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:02,421
Do you not know that your bodies

896
01:44:02,455 --> 01:44:05,726
are temples of the holy spirit?

897
01:44:05,759 --> 01:44:07,326
Who is in you.

898
01:44:08,061 --> 01:44:11,765
Who you have received from God.

899
01:44:13,466 --> 01:44:15,636
You are not your own.

900
01:44:15,669 --> 01:44:18,672
You were bought at a price.

901
01:44:18,705 --> 01:44:20,574
Therefore...

902
01:44:20,607 --> 01:44:24,510
Honor God with your bodies.
