00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:36,216
Kay. Hi, it's Mike Adler
here from Creswick Police.

3
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,966
Look, I'm just calling about
your mum.

4
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,716
The neighbours haven't seen her
in a few days.

5
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,883
I've been by her house,
without much luck.

6
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,758
And I was just wondering
if you'd heard from her.

7
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:51,883
Could you give me a call
when you can? Thanks.

8
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,383
Gran?

9
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,341
Gran?

10
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,841
Gran?

11
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,300
Mum?

12
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:27,300
Gran?

13
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,466
Wait.

14
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,633
Just…wait out here.

15
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,383
Mum?

16
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,633
You should set up
in my old room.

17
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,425
What?

18
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:45,091
- Kay, what?
- Nothing.

19
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,508
Call straightaway if she…

20
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:48,133
- Yeah, I will.
- OK.

21
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,800
Does your mum
still drive?

22
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:03,383
Sometimes. But her car's
still at the house.

23
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:07,383
- And... any medical problems?
- No.

24
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:09,508
She's in her 80s.
She forgets things.

25
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,925
She managed to flood the house
last Christmas.

26
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,716
And when was the last time
you spoke to her?

27
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,508
It's been a while.

28
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:19,591
Could... you be more specific?

29
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,425
Um…

30
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:22,841
Well, in situations like this,

31
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,216
we... we need to come up
with a time line.

32
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:29,050
When Alex called last night,
he said he hadn't noticed

33
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:32,091
your mum leave the house
for a few days, maybe a week.

34
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,508
So, if we can figure out

35
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,591
who the last person was
to speak to her, we can...

36
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,550
- Yeah, of course, yeah.
- ..figure out exactly who…

37
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,050
Sorry. Um…

38
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,300
It's been a few weeks.

39
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:44,091
Work's been crazy.
You know how it is.

40
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,258
And what did you talk about?

41
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:55,800
Nothing, really. Normal stuff.

42
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,966
She didn't mention anything
about a holiday,

43
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:01,758
appointment out of town,
visiting friends?

44
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,425
No. Nothing like that.

45
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:07,675
We'll organise
the overall search strategy.

46
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:09,133
OK.

47
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,591
- Did you bring a recent photo?
- Yeah.

48
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:23,883
This was taken late last year.

49
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:48,091
Jesus Christ.

50
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:57,300
Great...

51
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:05,425
She's been putting food out
for Chester.

52
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,675
Is your boss OK
with you taking time off?

53
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:19,300
Yeah.

54
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,800
Well, no.

55
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,425
I stopped working
at the gallery.

56
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,050
Since when?

57
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,591
A while.

58
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,925
What are you doing for money?

59
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:39,008
I've got some decent shifts
back at the bar.

60
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,758
Still planning on
going back to uni?

61
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:43,966
I don't know, Kay.

62
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,300
So, what, you're just gonna work in a bar
for the rest of your life?

63
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,258
Yeah, maybe.

64
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,050
I'm glad you're here.

65
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:01,425
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to be doing.

66
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,633
I think you're doing it.

67
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,175
Edna!

68
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,216
Edna?!

69
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:48,008
- Edna!
- Mum!

70
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,383
Edna?!

71
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,675
Edna?!

72
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,716
Mum?!

73
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,633
Edna?!

74
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,050
Edna?!

75
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,633
Edna?!

76
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,925
We'll regroup
first thing tomorrow.

77
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:21,091
We should check
the trail by St Georges Lake.

78
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,716
Gran used to take me there
all the time when I was a kid.

79
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,841
Gran?

80
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,508
Jamie?

81
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,675
Hi, Sam.

82
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,675
What are you up to?

83
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,550
Patrolling.

84
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,716
OK.

85
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,550
Did you find her yet?

86
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,383
No, not yet.

87
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
When was the last time
you saw her?

88
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:53,841
Not for ages.

89
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,133
Dad doesn't like me
coming over anymore.

90
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,716
Why's that?

91
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:07,091
Smells weird.

92
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,550
Can I have a go?

93
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:12,008
I'm allowed.

94
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:15,466
You're 18!

95
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:17,216
When did that happen?

96
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:21,633
Oh!

97
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,591
Thanks, Jamie.
I really needed that.

98
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,383
I might go inside. It's freezing.

99
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:30,675
Do you want to come in?
Make you a Milo?

100
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,591
Nah.

101
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:38,675
That's OK.

102
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,175
It's D after that bit, not E.

103
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:30,050
How do you know?

104
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:32,758
Gran taught me.

105
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,633
Of course she did.

106
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,841
I could never get the curl
of the fingers right.

107
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,341
I think she gave up on me
at a certain point.

108
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,675
Are these locks new too?

109
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,966
I think she was scared.

110
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,258
Scared? Of what?

111
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,258
She called me a few weeks ago.

112
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:02,091
She thought someone
was coming into the house.

113
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
What? Why?

114
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:06,591
Doors were left open,
the lights were left on,

115
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,633
she... the...

116
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,008
..armchair had shifted.

117
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:12,633
Well…

118
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,091
..did you tell the police?

119
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,716
She forgets things.

120
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,258
You know what she's like.
It was her.

121
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:20,133
Well, why didn't you call me?
I could have driven up here.

122
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:21,841
I mean, what if she was…

123
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:25,133
What was that?

124
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:28,216
Kay?

125
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:30,133
Don't know.

126
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:06,966
What is that?

127
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,216
What... what's wrong?

128
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:06,841
Nothing.

129
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:10,216
Go to sleep.

130
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:26,508
Mum?

131
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,175
Where...?

132
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,008
Where have you been?

133
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:53,883
Tea?

134
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:56,716
Are you OK?

135
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:58,425
One sugar, right?

136
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:01,050
- Gran!
- Oh!

137
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,800
About half an hour ago.

138
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:11,216
No, she's... she's not hurt.

139
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:15,175
She's... As far as I can tell.
She won't tell me anything.

140
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:20,133
Whenever I ask, she just changes the subject,
acts like nothing happened.

141
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:22,175
Like she hasn't been gone
for three days.

142
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:26,216
Yeah, I don't wanna push her.
I just... I just hope she's OK.

143
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,341
Yeah. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah, I will. Bye.

144
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,341
- Any chest pain?
- No.

145
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,216
Breathlessness? Dysuria?

146
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:44,966
Dysuria?

147
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:46,550
Does it hurt to pee?

148
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:48,758
Oh. No.

149
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,383
Neither of those things.

150
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:54,383
Would you mind taking a slow walk
to your daughter and back?

151
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:02,133
- Edna, when's your birthday?
- April 10th.

152
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:04,008
And how about
your granddaughter's?

153
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,633
March 3rd.

154
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,716
Good.

155
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,175
See?

156
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,133
This one worries about me.

157
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:14,425
- May I?
- Mm-hm.

158
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:18,716
Do you know
how you got this bruise?

159
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,716
Oh... I must have knocked it.

160
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,175
Clumsy.

161
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:28,091
Just to be safe,
I'm going to recommend

162
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,091
that you not be by yourself
for the next couple of weeks.

163
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,216
- Is that really necessary?
- Sorry, Edna. I insist.

164
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:35,675
House arrest it is, then.

165
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,591
Well, tell them
it's a family emergency.

166
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,050
Yeah, I know that,
but he's perfectly capable.

167
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,591
Uh-huh. A week, maybe two.

168
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,425
Well, what do you expect...?

169
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:16,008
Yeah. Fine. Fine, email it.

170
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:23,133
I've gotta go, Luce.

171
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:41,925
What's that?

172
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:51,133
Do you know
where you were, Mum?

173
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,966
- Where?
- No, I'm asking you.

174
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:59,883
I suppose I went out.

175
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:01,466
Out where?

176
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:04,633
If I'd known you'd call the police,
I would have stayed home.

177
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:07,050
There's blood on your nightgown.

178
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:11,633
Do you need help?

179
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,550
With what?

180
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,383
There are Post-it notes
everywhere, Mum.

181
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,091
It's my house.
I can decorate it however I want.

182
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,550
Just tell me what happened!

183
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:26,508
Look, can we just
take it easy today?

184
00:27:26,716 --> 00:27:28,716
Gran must be exhausted.

185
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,258
Gran?

186
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:20,675
Oh.

187
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:23,675
Got your tea.

188
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:25,550
What service!

189
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:29,425
Sorry about Mum.

190
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:31,258
She was worried about you.

191
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,175
We all were.

192
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:46,758
I had to stop wearing it.

193
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:50,383
They say you shrink with age,
but my fingers just keep getting fatter.

194
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:53,508
It's lovely.

195
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:55,591
It's yours.

196
00:28:58,091 --> 00:28:59,508
Gran, I can't take this.

197
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,383
You might need it one day.

198
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,633
And your mother's
already had a go.

199
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:16,883
Wow, you cleaned up.

200
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:24,425
Please leave it. I've got a system.

201
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:29,258
- What are you doing?
- Work.

202
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:42,050
Look at this.

203
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:53,300
Guess I was.

204
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:56,800
Wow.

205
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:00,675
He could draw.

206
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,175
Yeah.

207
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,716
God, I haven't seen this for years.

208
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:13,716
Wait. What's this?

209
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:14,800
Oh...

210
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:18,383
Oh, that was on the property
when your grandparents inherited it.

211
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,883
My great-grandfather lived there.

212
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:25,466
- By himself?
- Yeah. There were all these stories.

213
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,758
Apparently, his mind
wasn't all there in the end,

214
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:29,925
and nobody knew how bad it was.

215
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,216
I don't think he was cared for
like he should have been, you know?

216
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:36,008
Mm.

217
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,925
I was happy to see it go.

218
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,800
Mum used to threaten to lock me in it
when I was being a brat.

219
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:48,300
Is that the same window as
the one on the door downstairs?

220
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:50,091
Yeah.

221
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,758
Yeah, when they tore it down,
they saved some of the windows

222
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:55,716
and used them to build into this place.

223
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:01,133
Can you keep an eye on her
for a few hours tomorrow?

224
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:03,675
- Where are you going?
- Back to Melbourne.

225
00:31:03,883 --> 00:31:07,008
- You going back to work?
- No. I...

226
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:09,800
I've booked a tour
of a retirement place.

227
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,425
You can't put Gran in a home.

228
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,925
You heard her before.
She doesn't know where she was.

229
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,466
I don't think she can remember.

230
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:20,716
That's not what I heard.

231
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,175
She can't live on her own
anymore, Sam.

232
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,550
- Well, why can't she move in with you?
- Because that's not practical.

233
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:29,966
There's plenty of room at your place.

234
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:32,383
No, it's not about room.
She has to be watched.

235
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,466
Well, isn't that how it works?

236
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:37,591
Your mum changes your nappies
and then you change hers?

237
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:49,258
You need to be on the same side
as me for this.

238
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:53,091
Does Gran even get a say?

239
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,800
This is what's best for Gran.

240
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,341
What noise?

241
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,300
No. I didn't hear any noise.

242
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,383
I told you. I told you it's nothing.

243
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:54,008
There's no-one.

244
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:56,050
You're scaring me.

245
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,675
Mum?

246
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:11,758
Are you alright?

247
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,800
Are you leaving?

248
00:33:17,966 --> 00:33:19,383
No, Mum.

249
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:25,800
That's good.

250
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,175
Will you be alright now?

251
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:45,716
Mum?

252
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:57,758
Mum, what is it?

253
00:34:05,591 --> 00:34:07,091
It's here.

254
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,716
Under the bed.

255
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,883
No, there's nothing
under the bed, Mum.

256
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,133
Are you sure?

257
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:19,758
Yes.

258
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:27,050
Will you check for me?

259
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:33,425
Please.

260
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:39,800
See? Nothing.

261
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,758
You didn't look.

262
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,258
Ow!

263
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:22,966
Shit! Oh!

264
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:25,425
Oh!

265
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,341
You did that on purpose.

266
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,591
- Did what?
- You dropped that on purpose!

267
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,966
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

268
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:35,800
- Did you hit your head?
- Yes! Yes! Yes.

269
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:05,133
Now, you mentioned your mother
has some cognitive impairment?

270
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,466
Yeah,
I... I don't really know.

271
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:11,425
She forgets things.
She's started wandering.

272
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:14,841
Well, the staff here
are on call 24/7.

273
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,716
Think of it as independent living
with the edges taken off.

274
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:26,425
Just in here.

275
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,300
This side of the building
has ocean views.

276
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,508
Handrails in every room,

277
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:34,216
high toilet seat,

278
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,050
mobility aids if your mother needs help
getting in and out of bed.

279
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:42,466
No, she's fine with that kind of stuff.
She's fit, she's active. I...

280
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,258
I'm not even sure she's ready
for a place like this.

281
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:48,341
Well, it's five-star living.

282
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,466
Then there's the lifestyle
and therapy programs,

283
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:55,050
disability support,
computer classes.

284
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,550
Your mum'll make friends
in no time.

285
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,591
The rec room is decked out,
and every Sunday night...

286
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:02,008
Dance with me, Kimmy.

287
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,175
Sorry?

288
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,216
Dance with me, Sammy.

289
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:12,925
- Ah!
- Oh, no...

290
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:15,633
Yes! Here we go.

291
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,675
Oh, boy.

292
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:19,716
- Do you know the cha-cha?
- Absolutely not.

293
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,133
Time for a lesson.

294
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,216
One, two, three.
And one, two, three.

295
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,508
And one, two, three.

296
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:29,633
- And... It's the cha-cha!
- OK.

297
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:33,175
And... under arm for the lady.

298
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:34,925
- Oh, "the lady".
- And again.

299
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,008
And one more for Sammy.

300
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,341
This one always gets me.

301
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:53,716
Do you ever get lonely
out here by yourself?

302
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,716
Jamie doesn't come around here
much anymore, does he?

303
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,341
Who?

304
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,633
Jamie from next door.

305
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:11,383
Oh.

306
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,091
The retard.

307
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:23,466
How...

308
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:26,466
How would you feel about
me moving to Creswick?

309
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,425
Why would you want to do that?

310
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,883
To be closer to you.

311
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:37,925
I could help you out -
cook, clean, stuff like that.

312
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:41,133
Was this your idea or your mother's?

313
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:43,508
Mine.

314
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,216
Where would you live?

315
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:50,008
Here, in the house. With you.

316
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:51,800
I don't think so.

317
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:55,675
I'm not a... project, Kay.

318
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:58,175
I'm... I'm Sam, Gran.

319
00:39:58,383 --> 00:39:59,841
I know who you are.

320
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,675
Well, wouldn't it be better than
moving into an old folks' home?

321
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:05,841
That's where Mum is right now -
checking out a place in Melbourne.

322
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,050
Here, let me help.

323
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:14,925
- What's this?
- What?

324
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,883
- What are you doing with this?
- What do you mean?

325
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:18,966
- This is mine.
- Yeah, Gran, you gave it to...

326
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:20,966
You're trying to steal from me.
You're trying to rob me.

327
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:22,841
- No. Remember when you...
- Give it back.

328
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,466
- Give it back!
- Ow. Gran.

329
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,383
Ow! Ah!

330
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,591
Oh!

331
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:31,383
Fuck. Take it!

332
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,550
Gran?

333
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,383
Are these my school reports?

334
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:31,216
You're throwing these out?
I didn't even know you'd kept them.

335
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,383
Well, I have to make room, don't I?

336
00:42:37,175 --> 00:42:39,175
Room for what, Mum?

337
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:41,383
This one's moving in.

338
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,383
No, she's not. She...

339
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:50,383
I think you're confused, Mum.

340
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:54,008
I'm not sure why you think
it's your decision.

341
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,966
How was Melbourne?

342
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:55,175
Everything alright, Gran?

343
00:43:57,258 --> 00:43:59,133
I don't like this place.

344
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:03,050
Is that why you installed the lock?

345
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,216
I thought this was where it got in.

346
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:08,883
Who?

347
00:44:10,008 --> 00:44:12,633
Whoever was coming into the house.

348
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:18,050
Since your grandfather passed,
this house seems...

349
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:23,300
..unfamiliar. Bigger, somehow.

350
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:31,758
This house is the only thing left.

351
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:35,508
All our memories.

352
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:52,425
I'm glad you're moving in, Sammy.

353
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:25,133
Are you sure?

354
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,716
Gran?

355
00:47:09,175 --> 00:47:10,966
Gran?

356
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,466
Kay?

357
00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:07,716
Mum?

358
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:29,466
What's that noise?

359
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:32,925
I think there's something
in the house.

360
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,175
I need to go downstairs.

361
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:39,008
There's someone down there.

362
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,466
Everything alright in there, Mum?

363
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:55,300
Sammy?

364
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:22,300
I'm not being ridiculous.
I can tell.

365
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:27,425
Sometimes they look at me
and I... I don't think it's really them.

366
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,425
They look like Kay and Sammy,
but it's not them.

367
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,383
They're pretending.

368
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:38,925
You know what I think?
I think they're just waiting for the day.

369
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:42,633
I think they're hoping I'll go to sleep
and I won't wake up.

370
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:45,716
Then they'll dump me
in the ground to rot.

371
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:50,633
I can see you.

372
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,925
Who are you talking to?

373
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:19,925
- Gran, you're bleeding.
- I can do it myself.

374
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:22,050
- You've hurt yourself. Just...
- No!

375
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:24,758
- Gran, stop!
- Get out!

376
00:51:24,966 --> 00:51:26,008
Get out of here!

377
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,966
Get out! Get out! It's my room!

378
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:29,508
- It's my house! Get out!
- I'm sorry!

379
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:00,133
Hi, Sam.

380
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:02,800
- Hey, Jamie. How are you?
- I'm OK.

381
00:52:03,883 --> 00:52:05,966
- Is your dad home?
- Uh...

382
00:52:06,175 --> 00:52:07,841
Dad?!

383
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:12,883
Alex, what happened...
between Jamie and Gran?

384
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:20,175
They were playing hide-and-seek
and it was Jamie's turn to hide.

385
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,716
And he hid, I guess, in a cupboard
with a lock on it.

386
00:52:26,633 --> 00:52:30,883
Well, she came along and locked the closet
and... left him there.

387
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:33,591
I think she forgot they were playing.

388
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:36,591
He was trapped in that cupboard for hours.

389
00:52:37,883 --> 00:52:41,008
When he didn't come home,
I went over there to check on him and...

390
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,550
..Edna said she hadn't seen him.

391
00:52:44,758 --> 00:52:47,925
But I could... I could hear him
screaming from upstairs.

392
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:52,133
He had paint under his fingernails
just from scratching the door.

393
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:56,966
So, we've been keeping
our distance a bit.

394
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,925
Yeah. Nah, of course.

395
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:01,716
I get it.

396
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:08,008
I'm really sorry
Jamie had to go through that.

397
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:09,716
OK.

398
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,966
Mum...

399
00:54:22,966 --> 00:54:24,216
Mum, stop.

400
00:54:24,425 --> 00:54:25,758
Stop!

401
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:29,508
Ow! Jesus!

402
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:32,133
What are you doing, Mum?!

403
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:34,758
No! No!

404
00:54:34,966 --> 00:54:37,258
- Give it back!
- No, Mum! No!

405
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:39,425
I'm still your mother, Kay!

406
00:55:28,966 --> 00:55:31,591
I think these might be safe
out here.

407
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,425
Do you think that's right?

408
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:38,633
Safe from what, Mum?

409
00:55:39,925 --> 00:55:41,675
I don't know.

410
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,633
I knew it was a bad idea.

411
00:55:47,216 --> 00:55:48,633
I hate that window.

412
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,591
I can't bear to look at it
every time I go through that door.

413
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:55,883
There's such a...

414
00:55:57,425 --> 00:56:00,050
..coldness in the house.

415
00:56:02,383 --> 00:56:04,675
This is what I'm like now.
It's all I do.

416
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:06,383
I keep thinking...

417
00:56:06,591 --> 00:56:08,925
..thinking maybe it was
just waiting for me,

418
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:13,925
maybe it's just been waiting
till I was weak enough.

419
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:15,925
Alone enough.

420
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,466
I wish I could bury it myself
so it can't get at me.

421
00:56:29,216 --> 00:56:31,966
I just want to go home.

422
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:38,508
I just wish I... I could turn around and...

423
00:56:40,008 --> 00:56:41,758
..go back.

424
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:49,091
I'm losing everything, Kay.

425
00:56:50,341 --> 00:56:52,841
No. It's alright. You're not.

426
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:57,800
I'm here. I'm here to help you, Mum.

427
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:01,758
Come home with me.

428
00:57:03,383 --> 00:57:06,258
To Melbourne. Will you... will you
move into my place, Mum?

429
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,216
I'm sorry.

430
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:14,966
I'm sorry. Sorry I wasn't here more.

431
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,550
Please let me help you.

432
00:57:21,758 --> 00:57:23,175
Yeah?

433
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:26,008
Yeah.

434
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:32,883
Where's...

435
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:37,133
Where's my...

436
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:41,675
Where's everyone?

437
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:46,925
Your photo album?

438
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:48,633
It's here.

439
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,050
It's right here.

440
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,008
Where's everyone?

441
00:57:56,216 --> 00:57:59,508
They're here. They're here. I'm here.

442
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:01,591
It's alright, Mum.

443
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:07,300
Mum...

444
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:09,175
I won't leave you.

445
00:59:27,008 --> 00:59:29,216
I'll get dinner started.
What do you feel like?

446
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:32,300
Thanks, dear.

447
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,466
Sam, we're back!

448
01:00:02,008 --> 01:00:03,508
What the...?

449
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,841
Fuck this...

450
01:02:12,091 --> 01:02:13,425
What?

451
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:43,383
No, no. No.

452
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,133
Mum?

453
01:02:48,341 --> 01:02:49,466
Mum!

454
01:02:49,675 --> 01:02:50,758
Mum!

455
01:03:01,758 --> 01:03:05,466
You have called 042...

456
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:09,341
Well, her stuff's still here.

457
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,966
You should try to eat
something, Mum.

458
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,716
Mum?

459
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:23,800
Oh, Jesus! Mum!

460
01:04:24,008 --> 01:04:25,508
Mum, come on.

461
01:06:03,883 --> 01:06:05,800
Mum?

462
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:09,383
Mum? Mum?

463
01:06:43,758 --> 01:06:45,675
Mum!

464
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,716
Oh...

465
01:06:59,925 --> 01:07:01,425
Oh, Jesus! Mum!

466
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:03,716
Mum! What are you doing, Mum?

467
01:07:03,925 --> 01:07:06,508
Stop it! Mum! Open...

468
01:07:08,675 --> 01:07:09,841
Mum...

469
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,925
Mum! Open the door
right now! Mum!

470
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:14,300
Oh!

471
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:18,925
Your chest, Mum...

472
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,258
Mum?

473
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,216
Mum?

474
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,966
Mum? Mum, stop it.

475
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,175
Mum!

476
01:08:22,133 --> 01:08:23,216
Mum?

477
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:27,925
Oh, shit...

478
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:46,675
What?

479
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:19,716
What the fuck?

480
01:10:28,133 --> 01:10:29,591
Oh, what...?

481
01:10:56,675 --> 01:10:58,050
Mum?

482
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,633
Mum, please,
can we go back now?

483
01:11:08,883 --> 01:11:10,966
Ah! Oh!

484
01:11:13,216 --> 01:11:14,300
You're not Kay.

485
01:11:14,508 --> 01:11:15,966
Oh!

486
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:18,258
- I don't know you.
- No! Mum!

487
01:11:18,466 --> 01:11:20,091
No!

488
01:11:35,675 --> 01:11:37,091
Aah!

489
01:13:10,383 --> 01:13:12,133
Mum? Mum?

490
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:13,633
Mum?

491
01:13:27,008 --> 01:13:29,841
No... No!

492
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,758
Mum?

493
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:45,841
Aaah!

494
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,258
- Mum?
- Sam!

495
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:49,716
- Mum?!
- Where are you?

496
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:50,966
- I'm down here!
- Where?!

497
01:13:51,175 --> 01:13:52,633
Here!

498
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:55,675
Sam! Sam!

499
01:13:55,883 --> 01:13:57,508
Oh, Sam! Mum is not...

500
01:13:57,716 --> 01:13:59,341
It's not her anymore.

501
01:14:02,925 --> 01:14:04,341
- Mum...
- Yeah.

502
01:14:23,883 --> 01:14:25,091
Here. Give it to me.

503
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,550
Give that to me.

504
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:29,758
Hold that. Hold it!

505
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:51,091
Mum?

506
01:14:55,341 --> 01:14:56,633
Is that you, Gran?

507
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:59,175
It's OK, Sam.

508
01:14:59,383 --> 01:15:00,800
It's OK.

509
01:15:04,758 --> 01:15:06,050
Mum!

510
01:15:06,258 --> 01:15:08,008
Go, Sam, go! Get in there, go!

511
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:10,466
Go! Go!

512
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,758
Get out of here!

513
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:15,883
- Aah!
- Go!

514
01:15:17,675 --> 01:15:19,091
Mum...

515
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:21,300
I got you. I got you!

516
01:15:21,508 --> 01:15:22,383
Pull me...

517
01:15:22,591 --> 01:15:23,883
Aaagh!

518
01:15:24,091 --> 01:15:25,300
You're almost out!

519
01:15:25,508 --> 01:15:26,883
I've got you! I've got you!

520
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
Get me out! Get me out of here!

521
01:15:31,008 --> 01:15:32,258
Pull me!

522
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:41,883
No! Mum!

523
01:15:43,508 --> 01:15:45,091
Mum! Mum!

524
01:15:51,008 --> 01:15:52,550
Mum!

525
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:57,925
Mum!

526
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:32,550
Come on.

527
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,716
Kay.

528
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,633
Mum?

529
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,800
Come on.

530
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:27,550
Mum, what is it?

531
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:37,050
I can't leave her.

532
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,800
What?

533
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,800
Mum!

534
01:17:43,008 --> 01:17:45,966
Please don't!
It's not Gran anymore!

535
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:47,800
It's not Gran!

536
01:17:48,008 --> 01:17:49,133
Mum!

537
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:51,300
Please come back!

538
01:17:51,508 --> 01:17:53,966
Please come back!

539
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,216
Mum!

540
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:59,300
Mum, what are you doing?

541
01:18:01,258 --> 01:18:05,008
Mum? Mum, please, let's just go!

542
01:18:09,258 --> 01:18:10,341
Mum!

543
01:23:09,175 --> 01:23:11,258
Shh...

544
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,133
Shh...

545
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,258
Shh...

546
01:24:14,431 --> 01:24:19,431
