00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,185
Welcome home, Hunter.
This is your house.

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,981
Gonna look out of that window.
There's your front door.

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,275
Hi, Dad.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,402
How are you?

6
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,195
- Happy.
- Hi, little man.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,447
We got to keep him out
of the sun, too, OK?

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,615
Yeah. How are you feeling?

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,035
Guess who changed
the first, like, 15 diapers?

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,494
- This guy, right here.
- Wait, wait.

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,663
Guess who was in labor for a day?

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,956
- This girl.
- I've been in labor for...

13
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,332
- Hi.
- That's your mama.

14
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,419
Hi. Hunter, this is Martine,
your new nanny.

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,254
She will probably
fix your dirty diapers

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,380
- because I won't.
- Can I see?

17
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,882
Yes.

18
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,884
Oh, my goodness. Look at this.

19
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,510
- He's cute, right?
- Isn't he adorable?

20
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,930
He's kind of smooshy looking.
I'm not gonna lie.

21
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,640
He's just newborn,
he's a newborn...

22
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,435
Seriously, the cutest baby ever,
next to me. Second to me.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,395
Just touch him and
cuddle him all day long.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,272
You see how tiny he is?

25
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,776
Do you mind if I take him?
Not if he's sleeping,

26
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,861
but I want to take him
on a tour of the house.

27
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,322
OK. He's not sleeping.

28
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,367
That's Abby.
Gonna be your best friend.

29
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,369
Bye, sweetie.

30
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,164
This is a fireplace.
This is how Mommy seduced Daddy...

31
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,000
- Oh.
- ... and that's how we got you.

32
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,378
And that's why you're watching
this video at 25.

33
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,962
This is your room.

34
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,175
There's your crib.
It's a little sparse right now.

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,635
Just got some
caterpillar action going on.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,846
"Hunter. " See? Pretty cool.

37
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,349
This is your sister's trashed room.

38
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,685
- No, I'll check with him.
- Oh, there she is.

39
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,978
Wassup, brother
from another mother?

40
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,689
- What?
- No, Hunter's in...

41
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,693
You're never allowed to come in
here, ever. Unless I invite you.

42
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,319
In which case, it's gonna be
the best day of your life.

43
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,613
By the way, that's my bathroom.
Don't ever go in there.

44
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,491
That's half your bathroom. It's actually
my bathroom, 'cause I bought it.

45
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,160
All that is mine.
Don't pee on my seat!

46
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,455
This is the living room
that no one ever uses.

47
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,708
Hey, somebody left
the front door open!

48
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,379
Nice.
Don't do that, OK?

49
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,133
This is my first man cave.
That's where all my genius ideas come.

50
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,676
This is the second man cave,

51
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,970
where we're gonna watch
Chargers games together.

52
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,764
This is my 50-inch monster.

53
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,433
Look at that. It's beautiful.

54
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,397
I don't even know
if I swaddled him right.

55
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,774
It's just... Yeah.

56
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,613
Hi, baby boy. Hi.

57
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,906
Hi.

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,911
- He smells good.
- Yes.

59
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,498
You're just like Daddy.

60
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,626
You make poops all the time.

61
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,383
- Is that good?
- Si.

62
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,010
OK.

63
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:01,848
Is a special baby. Si?

64
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,187
- Thank you.
- That is so cute.

65
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,646
I'll get it!

66
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,029
- Hey! Let me see this baby.
- Hi!

67
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,280
- Aunt Katie!
- Where is he?

68
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,865
He's upstairs.

69
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,118
Hi.

70
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,916
Hi. Hi.

71
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,086
You are so precious.

72
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,005
Hi.

73
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,218
I already love you so much.

74
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,303
- My sister did good.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,971
You probably had a little
part in it, I don't know.

76
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,556
- Very little.
- Hi.

77
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,103
It's her boyfriend.
Yeah, he's a big boy, just like his...

78
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,438
Kinda just eating cookies.

79
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,607
Hello, baby.

80
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,693
- Dad, my burger?
- Or whatever.

81
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,403
- Right, sorry.
- Gimme another plate.

82
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,410
- Nice.
- Did you get that?

83
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,954
- I want you to meet my Aunt Katie.
- Wait.

84
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,247
Does it stay on?

85
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,290
It does stay on,
but I didn't want to get it wet.

86
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,210
Oh, no, of course not.
That would be ridiculous.

87
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,920
- That would ruin it.
- That is so...

88
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,339
- Swear to God, I will kill you.
- Look at that, perfect.

89
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,841
Perfect handoff right there.

90
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,386
She's my only niece. Not really,
but I think of her as my niece.

91
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,595
She's my step-niece.

92
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,182
- I'm the evil step-aunt.
- Step?

93
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,435
The evil step-aunt? I'm not sure
how to take that. I'm not sure...

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,770
Well, I'm not really evil,
but I can be evil is my point.

95
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,231
Dad, the face came off!

96
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,488
- There can be only one!
- I will not let you go.

97
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,991
I can't believe he's over a year old.

98
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,243
Where's Micah?

99
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,953
Oh, he...

100
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,205
He wasn't up for hanging out today.

101
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,835
I can't find the tape.

102
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,837
That's fine, I'm just
gonna tape over an old one.

103
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,131
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!

104
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,884
We just got back and the whole
place has been just destroyed.

105
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,595
Nothing seems to be missing.
It's just, everything's really...

106
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,138
But that's what she's telling me.

107
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,474
Make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.

108
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,560
This is our foyer.
The furniture's damaged.

109
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,479
My daughter Ali's room.

110
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,193
It just feels... gross
that somebody was in here.

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,736
Master bedroom.

112
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,656
Yeah, so that's great.

113
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,493
- Your watches are still there?
- Yeah.

114
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,036
Diamonds are here.

115
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,832
The only thing missing is
the necklace my sister made me.

116
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,293
Oh, sweetie.

117
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,295
This is horrible. It's fucking horrible.

118
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,340
It's the nursery.

119
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,927
As far as I know,
this room was not touched.

120
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,517
This is our basement.

121
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,854
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't know if there's anything...

122
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,941
I don't think they did anything
down here. I... What is that?

123
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,861
Is that Abby?
It really stinks, though.

124
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,030
- Oh.
- Well, clothes are still here.

125
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,742
Your bikes are still here.
Not that you're using those.

126
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,119
And your bike is over here, so...

127
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,247
And the epic clean continues.

128
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,665
This looks like we had a party.

129
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,376
Right?

130
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,461
Worst party ever.

131
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,966
I don't know, kiddo.
This is messed up.

132
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,136
What are you talking about?
They didn't take anything. We're fine.

133
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,554
You're fine.

134
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,893
So this is it.
Like I said, about a week ago,

135
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,396
- the place was completely trashed.
- Hello.

136
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,981
- Hello.
- That's our daughter, Ali.

137
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,027
Pretty much every room in the house.
We had both doors locked.

138
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,695
Put one up here, up in the corner,

139
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,865
and then you get the whole stairway,
the front door, this whole hallway.

140
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,285
One over there, facing this way,
you'd get this door and this door.

141
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,746
Or have one in here, getting
all these windows, the sliding...

142
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,372
They run, like, all the time?

143
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,751
Yeah, they're always recording.
You can't get away with anything.

144
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,795
That stuff.

145
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,714
Corner up there, so you get
who's coming in and out

146
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,507
- of this door, that door.
- Bathroom.

147
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,885
And you get to see
the baby at night, too.

148
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,678
You're not putting one
in my bathroom, right?

149
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,263
- Yeah. What?
- Wait.

150
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,474
Put a camera that sees in complete dark.
It'd be perfect.

151
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,517
- Yeah, really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

152
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,312
- Yeah, OK, that'd be sweet.
- They'll look like motion detectors.

153
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,481
Little tiny hole.
I have one I could show you.

154
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,608
- Can you put one in that bunny?
- Very cool.

155
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,611
And then we can,
I can set you up with the...

156
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,739
Yeah, so, I'm gonna close
it up there like that.

157
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,324
It's hidden.
Can't even tell it's a camera.

158
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,909
How many are we getting?

159
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,579
I don't know. But what'd you...?
What, is that... six?

160
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,417
- I don't know.
- One, two, three...

161
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,888
What are you doing
out here, little buddy?

162
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,530
Yeah. Go get it.

163
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,451
You're super fast, big man.

164
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,745
What's Martine doing?

165
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,497
What is she doing?

166
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,210
He's good, right?

167
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,092
You're a good puppy.
What you say, Abby?

168
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,387
Hey, Hunter. Hunter,
you want another fishy?

169
00:09:55,553 --> 00:10:00,308
What are you doing?
What you doing?

170
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:07,649
Oh, buddy, I think it's time for N-A-P.
What do you think?

171
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,360
Yeah?

172
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,530
Come on. Come here, buddy,
let's move this first.

173
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,991
OK. Aw, that's a good baby.
That's a good baby. OK.

174
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,869
Oh! You gotta help me
out here, buddy.

175
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,539
Thank you.
That's a good boy.

176
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,713
OK.

177
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,010
I know. Everything's fine,
you're just superbaby.

178
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,849
Did you do this all by yourself? Man,
Daddy's gonna be so proud.

179
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,269
OK, I'll just clean up the rest
of it when I bring you back.

180
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,234
What's up, Martine?

181
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:56,114
Wassup? What's up, Ali?

182
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,075
What were you doing?
What were you doing earlier?

183
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,579
When you were, like,
talking to yourself?

184
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,540
All crazy like.
Are you going crazy here, too?

185
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,626
- No... crazy.
- You're just getting it from all of us.

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,255
The house is...
There are bad things in the house?

187
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,381
No.

188
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,427
- You're getting rid of spirits. OK.
- Uh-huh.

189
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,595
All right.

190
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,681
The good ones...

191
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,685
- We keep the good ones.
- Yes.

192
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,812
In with the good, out with the bad.

193
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,233
In with the paella, out with the...

194
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,235
Holy crap, that's a lot of garlic.

195
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,199
One, two, three.

196
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,493
One, two, three.

197
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,996
Oh, I almost got him.

198
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,581
One, two...

199
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,837
Oh, my God!
Look at what Martine left!

200
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,965
- Oh!
- Disgusting! I wanna throw up! It...

201
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,009
She put it in the freaking...

202
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,096
- No, you! That was you!
- It's not me!

203
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,681
- Don't blame somebody else!
- Hand to God!

204
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,100
God, there was like a live
crawdaddy in there.

205
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,435
- She clogged it. I can't look.
- That is a stench-ilada.

206
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,230
- That is horrible. You're grounded.
- I'm not capable of...

207
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,731
You are grounded. Awful.

208
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,234
This is the best bath...

209
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,112
- It looks pretty good.
- ... I've... I think it...

210
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,823
Well, if you come in,
it'll be the best bath I've ever...

211
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,536
It's so quiet and, like, there's
nobody here. It's fantastic.

212
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,164
I love Martine, but I'm kind of loving
the fact that she's not here.

213
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,750
- Yeah.
- What time is your sister coming?

214
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,504
What time is it now?

215
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,173
7:20. Something like that.

216
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,843
Oh, like an hour or so.

217
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,637
You should definitely pop in.

218
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,432
I don't want to smash you,
but I kind of want to get in.

219
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,600
You don't want to smash me?
I kinda want you to smash me.

220
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,978
- Really? Oh.
- Yeah.

221
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,855
Let me release the Kraken.

222
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,646
Hey.

223
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,609
You're OK.

224
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,324
I gotcha.

225
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,327
You're OK. You're OK.

226
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,746
Look, it's perfect, right?

227
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,457
- That's a lot of grease in there.
- I'm gonna drain it.

228
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,959
Here, goofy mug.

229
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,128
Do you need anything?

230
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,298
- Hey!
- Are you making breakfast?

231
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,176
- Thank you so much.
- How you doing?

232
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,928
- I was, but, uh...
- Hola.

233
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,055
- Did he keep you up?
- Yeah, yeah.

234
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,640
- He definitely kept me up.
- Yeah, he does that.

235
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,016
I love you so much.

236
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,811
- I love you so much.
- Thank you so much.

237
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,896
- I love you so much.
- That's OK. Aw.

238
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,482
You're amazing. I don't think
I'm really awake yet, though.

239
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,650
There's coffee.

240
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,861
I love my sister
She's the best

241
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,280
Remember that time
you tried to be a vegan

242
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,659
- for like six hours?
- A day and a half?

243
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,369
- That was a difficult time.
- It was for one meal.

244
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,538
- Making bacon?
- Yeah.

245
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,707
- Good morning.
- Yo, yo, yo, what up?

246
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,584
Thank you for loaning out
your beautiful girlfriend for the night.

247
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,421
- What up?
- She made my day.

248
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,506
Tell me that's not yours.

249
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,508
It's not really mine, no.

250
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:44,801
Thanks for not watching
the sausage for us, Ali.

251
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,969
I did watch it!

252
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,470
It's mine and hers.
She uses it most.

253
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,472
Cool. It's HD.
Do I get some love, too?

254
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,809
What?

255
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,853
You scared little Hunter.

256
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,024
How's it going?
Can I get you some coffee?

257
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,484
- Dude, I have a bone to pick with you.
- Yeah?

258
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,320
I went into Burger King,
and I was like, hey, man.

259
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,198
I tossed your name around and they
didn't give me any free food, dude.

260
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,492
I don't own, like, every Burger King.

261
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,122
He's not actually
the king of Burger King.

262
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,248
I'm not?

263
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,001
I'm still in the process of easing him
in to the fact that we live together

264
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,003
and, therefore, the house should
represent the both of us.

265
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,298
Well, yeah, but the both
of us, like, a give and take.

266
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,258
Like you have your beading
thing or whatever it is,

267
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,177
and then I have my area, you know?

268
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,387
- The whole rest of the house?
- Of manliness.

269
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,515
I'm telling you, that baby's gonna be
a rock star when he grows up.

270
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,770
Yeah, get it. Whoa!
Dad, careful, are you watching that?

271
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,022
There was no sign
of forced entry, but...

272
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,317
They trashed our whole house.
I mean, I think it was more vandalism.

273
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,527
See that thing in the corner?
Looks like a motion detector?

274
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,364
- Are you, like...?
- That's a camera.

275
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,699
We're watching you!

276
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,411
You like little wheels that roll.

277
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,291
You're such a ham.
Such a ham. Are you leaving?

278
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,461
Things have gotten a little difficult
since he learned how to open the door.

279
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,174
So are you freaked
out after the break in?

280
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,261
Yeah, I mean, I definitely was.
I don't think I was sleeping very well.

281
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,514
Oh, sweetie? Sweetie.

282
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,808
I would be freaked out,
too, if, you know,

283
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,309
somebody had broken into my house.

284
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,104
Well, it's just, they
didn't take anything. You know?

285
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,855
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

286
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,402
It seemed personal.
It feels like they're always still here.

287
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,445
You know? I don't know, I...

288
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,615
I get this feeling,
like when we were little.

289
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,075
What?

290
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,328
Never mind.

291
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,541
Mac and cheese,
mac and cheese.

292
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,335
Hey, Kris? I'm gonna go out.
I'm not gonna be in.

293
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,254
- Oh, OK. Where are you going?
- Just the mall.

294
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,588
All right, well, have fun.

295
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,633
- Bye!
- Bye!

296
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,636
Mac and cheese.
Mac and cheese.

297
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,430
No?

298
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,084
Hey, what's up there?

299
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,339
Let's look at baby Hunter.

300
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,550
Boy, that one was bad.
That's that bee bonnet that the...

301
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,929
He's like, that was totally humiliating.
Nobody needs to see this.

302
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,555
- Oh, this is crazy.
- What?

303
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,891
- Who do you think that is?
- Is that you?

304
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,519
No, that's your Aunt Katie.
That's...

305
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,104
- That's Katie?
- That's so weird.

306
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,731
I thought we lost all
our pictures in the fire.

307
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,316
That's great.

308
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,529
Yo, Martine?

309
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,575
Kristi and Dad are out
tonight. I'm going out tonight.

310
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,078
You gonna have your
boyfriend over? Have a party?

311
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,665
- Este Brad. Novio.
- Yeah.

312
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,917
He, he boy.

313
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,128
...want handsy, handsy,
touchy. No.

314
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,338
"No. "

315
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,590
- The handsy, handsy, touchy?
- The handsy-handsy, si.

316
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,218
Is that the kind of dance you
were showing me, the Handsy?

317
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,345
Shake it.

318
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,480
I thought I was gonna have
to give him the Heimlich.

319
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,232
Hey, what are you doing?

320
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,110
That's enough, Martine.
Put it down.

321
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,528
Martine, he's fine.

322
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,530
I've asked you
not to do this, OK?

323
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:31,823
It is not good for the baby.

324
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,367
Please,
put it out right now.

325
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,661
No más, no más.
That's enough.

326
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,289
Put it out right now, please.

327
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,416
OK, that's enough.

328
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,503
What are you doing?

329
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,173
- The baby is fine, OK?
- No, no.

330
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,717
The baby should not be breathing that.
Nobody should.

331
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,554
No, I don't...
Just stop doing it, please.

332
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,766
Goddamn it.

333
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,565
God.

334
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,362
OK, that's like two months.
All right?

335
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,914
- OK? I told you.
- Si.

336
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,881
I do understand, OK? I just,
I don't believe in that stuff,

337
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:33,093
OK? It's just... I cannot have that
stuff in my house. OK?

338
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,720
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

339
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,641
Can I give you a great
recommendation, OK?

340
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:40,850
You were very good for us.

341
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,861
Da-da.

342
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,122
Come on, make Daddy proud.
Say, "Da-da. "

343
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,793
Hunter, look over here.

344
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,670
Hunter?

345
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,715
You are so like your dad.

346
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,762
Sweetie. Sweetie?

347
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,473
Come on, come on.

348
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,352
What are you looking at?

349
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,770
Look at Mama.

350
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,064
Look at Mama.

351
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:32,694
Buddy? What? What? Oh.

352
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,030
Look over here.

353
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,240
There's nothing there, goofball.

354
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,118
Where are you going?
Hunter?

355
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,084
I can't see you back there.

356
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,420
We were up in the nursery,
playing, and I was trying

357
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:53,590
to get him to say "Da-da" again,
and he just wouldn't focus.

358
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,468
He was looking at the ceiling and
mirror, everywhere but me.

359
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:00,347
Well, he's a baby. He's got an attention
span of a guppy. You know?

360
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,932
I guess, but there was definitely
something he was focused

361
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,060
on, and it wasn't
my pretty face.

362
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,898
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

363
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,025
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

364
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,985
Check this out.

365
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,446
- Dad, can you please not do that?
- Yeah, night vision.

366
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,032
Cool, I'm gonna get nail polish
on the bed. Please?

367
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,533
You got freaky eyes.
You look like a possum.

368
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,659
Dad.

369
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:24,245
- There we go.
- Painting my nails, Dad.

370
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,539
Why are you in here?
What do you want?

371
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,084
- Sorry, crabby.
- I'm not crabby.

372
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,378
You're Crabby McRumpelstein.

373
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,881
- Why did I fire Martine?
- Yeah.

374
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,716
Because I didn't like her
doing all that weird

375
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,552
- witchy stuff around Hunter.
- It wasn't witchy.

376
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,931
It wasn't witchy...
It wasn't hurting anybody.

377
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,475
It made her feel better,
and she wanted to make us feel better.

378
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,228
She was, like, slaughtering goats
out by the pool, OK?

379
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,854
- No, she wasn't.
- All right.

380
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:54,150
Good luck and it's... Stay in the lines.

381
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,860
- What? Dad!
- Check it.

382
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,904
- On! Stop!
- Off.

383
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,532
Let me get one more. Oh!

384
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,081
Come here.

385
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,666
Come here, come on.

386
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,753
It's OK.
It's OK, buddy. It's OK.

387
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:20,278
No.

388
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,697
It's OK, buddy,
there's nothing there.

389
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,659
Is that what
woke you up, buddy?

390
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:34,519
Daniel!

391
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,564
Daniel?

392
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,901
God. Nasty.

393
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,446
- Dad, don't pick it up with your hands.
- Why not?

394
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,615
Because it could, like...
They can have diseases and stuff...

395
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,034
- It flew into the window...
- It's so sad.

396
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,160
I don't even want to look at it.

397
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,203
- What?
- Its neck is all broken.

398
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,122
Oh, my God,
just put it in the thing!

399
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,999
- I'm trying to...
- Why did you pick it up with tong...?

400
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,792
- I don't know.
- What do you think?

401
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,586
- Stop!
- Medium, medium rare?

402
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,963
- You're really mean.
- It's just a dead bird.

403
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,090
- Oh.
- It was a live bird. And then it...

404
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,134
- It's really sad.
- OK.

405
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:09,512
You like the ball? You like ball?

406
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,099
Ball, ball, hit it. Smack it!

407
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:16,478
What's in there? Get in.
What's in there?

408
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,272
Oh, buddy. Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

409
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,944
Hunter? Oh, shit.

410
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,657
Hunter, come here! Come here.

411
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,677
Fuck!

412
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:29,486
What are you doing
back out here? Go.

413
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,866
Your dog does
not like pool cleaners.

414
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,619
Yo, what's the deal with your dog?!

415
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:41,414
Honestly, we're not really sure.

416
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:47,003
Splash, splash. One, two, three.
Splash, splash, splash.

417
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:49,506
This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

418
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:50,757
Splash, splash, splash.

419
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:55,428
I think I might definitely start to
replace my girlfriend with this camera.

420
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:57,597
- Uh-huh. See? We're scared.
- It's got more features.

421
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,934
Flip the thing, film yourself.
It flips. Oh, yeah, yeah.

422
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,770
- Oh, shit.
- Then it shows you...

423
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,106
No. I'm definitely
getting one of these.

424
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:09,401
I'll bet you guys go
extracurricular with this.

425
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:11,361
Who has time for that?
We've got a baby.

426
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,571
How's Daniel Rey
and his brood doing?

427
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:17,283
Oh, apparently, we have a ghost.
Did you hear about this?

428
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,912
I did not. Please elaborate,
'cause that's a very strange thing to...

429
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,040
A couple pots fell off our pot
hanger thing in the kitchen.

430
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,126
- You definitely have a ghost.
- Straight to ghost.

431
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,752
That's the most logical...

432
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:32,549
She thinks everything is, like,
a ghost or a... Don't you, honey?

433
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:33,967
What?

434
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,302
- Think everything is a ghost?
- You don't have a ghost.

435
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,555
- Yeah, you're definitely haunted.
- No.

436
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,306
You and your sister are, like, freaky...

437
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,768
- Katie, you're into this stuff?
- You don't know this stuff?

438
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,021
They used to do, like, séances
and shit when they were little.

439
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:47,772
- No!
- Yes.

440
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,357
We didn't do séances.

441
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,484
- No.
- Who'd you talk to?

442
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:53,069
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

443
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:56,281
- Katie...
- Babe, it was really no big deal.

444
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,701
- What's no big deal?
- I probably, you know,

445
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,161
I just don't talk about
this stuff anymore.

446
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,370
What stuff?

447
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:04,831
They used to do séances
when they were little kids.

448
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:08,001
It's really not that funny. You're
laughing. It's not a big deal, babe.

449
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,544
The truth is, when we were kids,

450
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,838
we got a little freaked out,
but it's really no big deal.

451
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,049
And we're having a good day
today, so let's just...

452
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,343
- We'll explore this in detail later.
- Let's focus...

453
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,845
What about the Lizzie Borden one?
The axe murderer one?

454
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,598
You're thinking
of every, like, childhood...

455
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:24,434
How, where do, how would I...
Back me up...

456
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,894
How would I know this stuff
if you didn't tell us?

457
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,646
What's your take
on this ghost situation?

458
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,106
I think it's awesome.

459
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,132
Jesus Christ!

460
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:20,800
Fuck!

461
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,845
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

462
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,056
There it is.

463
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:33,855
Ali!

464
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,609
- I thought we said good night, Brad!
- Yeah, no. We did...

465
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:39,861
- Get the fuck out of here right now!
- I'm not even here.

466
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,696
Ali, did you
leave the burner on?

467
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,198
No?

468
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:45,825
You almost burned the fucking house...

469
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,286
Not cool, Brad.

470
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,166
How could I put it up wrong?
It's on a hook.

471
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,919
- Once it goes up, it's up.
- You were probably putting

472
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:59,714
it on the edge of the top part,
instead of inside.

473
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,884
The fact that it fell a second time
probably proves

474
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:06,012
- that you put it up wrong both times.
- OK.

475
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,806
You want me to show
you how to put it up?

476
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,766
No, no, no.
Then why are you putting

477
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:11,810
the pool cleaner
back in every morning?

478
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,353
For the last week?

479
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,021
'Cause it's a pool cleaner, and I want
it to clean the pool.

480
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:18,608
- How does it get out at night?
- How does it get out?

481
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,236
- Yeah.
- Is it taking the car? Is it...

482
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:23,029
Oh, come on, honey.
No, really.

483
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,532
I don't know. I assume somebody takes it
out when they go swimming.

484
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,200
I don't take it out,
and you don't take it out.

485
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,327
Ali, do you take the pool
cleaner out of the pool?

486
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:30,662
- What?
- Do you take the pool

487
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,872
- cleaner out of the pool?
- No.

488
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:35,709
What? So it's crawling
out of the pool?

489
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,211
It's crawling
out of the pool by itself?

490
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,547
I don't know. Let's...
You know what?

491
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:43,425
You wanted all the cameras.
Let's go check the DVR.

492
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:45,885
Fine, let's go check it.

493
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,887
- You serious?
- Yeah, I'm very serious.

494
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,848
We'll find out what else is going
around here at night.

495
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,307
- Can I tape it, though?
- Yeah.

496
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:01,317
- What?
- See?

497
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:03,570
That is weird.

498
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:07,991
Maybe I have it set too high
or something, I don't know.

499
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,200
No.

500
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,579
No, I don't, I don't think
the settings are off.

501
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,256
Maybe the settings are off.

502
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:25,258
That's what we got it for.

503
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,261
It's probably trying to be proactive.
Do the little patio.

504
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:31,681
It's like one of those
vacuum cleaner things you set up.

505
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:34,476
Yeah, it's like a Flowbee, but with...

506
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,396
I don't know if the house is
haunted, but I hope it is.

507
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,483
- You hope it is?
- Yeah.

508
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:44,110
Are you kidding me?
That would be fucking awesome.

509
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:45,612
Why would you hope
that the house is haunted?

510
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,989
That'd be the coolest thing ever.

511
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:50,742
If there was somebody trying to,
like, get through to us,

512
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:53,661
- that would be amazing.
- No, I just...

513
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:57,290
Kristi is obviously not sleeping.

514
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,210
Dude.

515
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:02,003
She doesn't have any...

516
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,174
Her hormones are all kooky.
She's got... paranoid mommy...

517
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,760
...just interpreting them
in the wrong way.

518
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:12,430
Like, she's seeing them as,
as harmful and dangerous.

519
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:15,850
And maybe we should just see them
as something trying to, like...

520
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:18,103
Like, I think we should have a séance.

521
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,730
- We could go full out... What?
- That's a great idea.

522
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,608
Just freaky. I don't...
I don't believe in it.

523
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:26,861
Why do you think that it necessarily
has to be bad, though?

524
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:28,238
That's all I'm asking.

525
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,824
- How would it be good?
- Like, what if it's Mom?

526
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:37,807
- Hey, guys.
- What?

527
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:39,809
There's something you need to see.

528
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,020
- What are you talking about?
- What's going on?

529
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,730
- You're freaking me out.
- You have to see...

530
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:45,899
Honey, what are
you talking about?

531
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:54,074
What are... you talking about?
What is it?

532
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,618
- I don't see anything.
- I don't understand.

533
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:04,042
- Yeah!
- That's not funny.

534
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,335
Yeah!

535
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:11,966
Sweetie?

536
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:16,262
Come on,
that was kind of funny, right?

537
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:19,057
I just, I hate it when you
don't take me seriously.

538
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:21,935
I'm sorry, honey. I do take you
seriously. I was just trying to...

539
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,353
I'm just trying to lighten things up.

540
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,438
I just want us to kind of
get back to normal.

541
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:27,691
Like I was thinking maybe
we could go out?

542
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:29,776
- Like... like grownups?
- Yeah, right.

543
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:33,071
Right. How am I gonna leave?

544
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:35,156
Why, why are
you laughing? We can go.

545
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,992
- Martine's gone.
- No, Ali can watch the baby.

546
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,162
With the break in, and all
the weird stuff going on,

547
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,664
I just don't want to leave him alone.

548
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,667
You know, we can't just
let this affect us that much.

549
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,168
If we do that, the terrorists win.

550
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:49,504
Right?

551
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:53,341
I miss you, you know?
I miss my wife, the fun wife.

552
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:54,968
And I know I've been kind of a tool.

553
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:56,803
And I just wanna...

554
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:59,389
Oh, my God.
He looks so tired. Look at him.

555
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:03,810
He's almost passed out.

556
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:07,022
Yeah, I think somebody has time
for a nap. Come here, buddy.

557
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:11,067
- Bye. Bye, grumpster.
- Oh, I know. Fussy baby.

558
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:12,193
Fussy fussy.

559
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:53,360
God! Hot! Oh, man!

560
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:02,327
Did you leave the heater
on in the hot tub?

561
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:03,912
- No.
- No?

562
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:07,082
- It's like a million degrees in there!
- No. Why would I...

563
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,209
That was two nights ago,
and I turned it off.

564
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,294
- Oh, my God. Are you OK?
- Were you out there with Brad?

565
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:13,838
- Yeah, two nights ago.
- Honey, honey. What's going on?

566
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:17,175
It wouldn't be boiling. The highest
it goes up to is like 90-something.

567
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,260
Give me something cold.
Like, peas?

568
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:22,472
- Are you OK?
- God.

569
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:24,766
God. Boiled my nuts right now.

570
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:28,978
- What exactly...
- I'm gonna call that guy.

571
00:45:29,145 --> 00:45:31,398
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

572
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,860
All right, so all the emergency numbers
are in this cabinet.

573
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,112
Yep.

574
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:42,826
But now his new doctor is in there.
And also his allergist.

575
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:46,079
- And remember, no peanuts on anything.
- I know, no peanuts.

576
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,000
Make sure the doors and the
windows are locked, OK?

577
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,919
Upstairs, in the back,
out front, every...

578
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:54,087
- Go!
- I love you.

579
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,047
- Have a great time with him.
- Bye.

580
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:59,467
- I love you!
- Bye. Have a good time.

581
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:02,345
- Take the money. Coming!
- Bye! Say, "Bye, Mama!"

582
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,390
Bye. Bye!

583
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:07,434
Don't get too wasted!

584
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:09,936
Bye!
Can you say bye-bye?

585
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:27,162
Jesus Christ.

586
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,497
- What the...?
- Hello?

587
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,791
- Did I scare you?
- Yes.

588
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:34,961
Lightly. Have to warm up the board.

589
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,880
You have to warm up the board?

590
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:41,718
If a spirit's present,
will you give us a sign?

591
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,391
Like, literally, anything.

592
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:51,144
- Literally...
- Yeah, no, there's...

593
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:54,230
OK. What do you want?

594
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:03,365
- Brad. Brad.
- I'm not moving it.

595
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:06,326
It's not me.

596
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,329
"P"...

597
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:20,799
..."U"...

598
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:27,555
- Ali, are you doing this?
- No, I'm fucking not.

599
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:32,727
..."S"...

600
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,402
..."S"...

601
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:43,363
- What the fuck?
- Wait, it's still going.

602
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:46,533
It goes to the "Y."
Oh, it spells "pussy. "

603
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,660
I mean, what, what...
Hey, hey, hey.

604
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:49,828
Pussy?!

605
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:52,956
Maybe the spirit...
spirits want some pussy.

606
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:54,124
Spirits?

607
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:57,210
Yes, the spirits might
be horny at the moment.

608
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:00,922
- You never know. I know I am.
- Pussy.

609
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,632
You know what?
We should keep going.

610
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:07,303
- Wait, do you feel that?
- Yes, 'cause you're moving it.

611
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:08,596
No, I'm not moving it.

612
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:10,640
No, this time
I'm really not moving it.

613
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:14,352
- It's...
- Wait. "H"...

614
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:17,272
Pussy-ehh.

615
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:21,443
No, Ali, I'm really, I'm really
not moving it this time.

616
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:22,777
I promise you.

617
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,199
No, what the fuck?
Are you doing this?

618
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,952
No.

619
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:32,412
"N"...

620
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:39,544
- ... "T"...
- "Pussy Hunt. "

621
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,173
It's like the worst
game of Ouija ever.

622
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:46,843
Did you spell that? Are you trying
to tell me something?

623
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:49,012
Yeah, yeah,
I spelled "pussy hunt. "

624
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,805
Would you like me
to go on a pussy hunt?

625
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:52,932
I can do that for
you right now.

626
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:57,645
...only $2.99
a square foot.

627
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:00,523
Complete bamboo flooring as low
as $1.99 a square foot.

628
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:01,858
These deals...

629
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:10,033
America runs on Dunkin'.

630
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:12,619
Lumber Liquidators' warehouse
is full of mill overstocks,

631
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:14,204
bankruptcies,
buyouts and deals,

632
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,164
like six-millimeter
laminate floor...

633
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,173
...incredible prices
on the best quality

634
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:09,551
all-wood kitchen cabinets
in honey oak, hickory,

635
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:11,803
solid red oak and
sumptuous dark chocolate,

636
00:50:11,928 --> 00:50:14,055
all in stock now
at our warehouse stores.

637
00:50:14,222 --> 00:50:16,182
Cabinets To Go doesn't have
fancy showrooms,

638
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:17,976
but they do have
superb qual...

639
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:06,775
Brad?

640
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,031
Come on.

641
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,412
Oh, shit.

642
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:49,317
Shit.

643
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,022
Hi.

644
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:44,242
Ali?

645
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:50,665
Oh.

646
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,087
Oh, there you go,
that's better, right?

647
00:54:57,672 --> 00:54:58,673
Ali?

648
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,717
Is Ali upstairs?

649
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:03,511
- No, she isn't up here.
- She's not upstairs?

650
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,515
Ali? Ali!

651
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,813
Dad? Dad? Kristi?

652
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:15,315
- Where have you been?!
- Oh, my God.

653
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,983
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

654
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:19,027
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry. I got locked out.

655
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:21,237
Why would you even answer the door to
somebody just knocking?

656
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:22,864
- Just open the door?
- No, I thought...

657
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,407
Did you look outside
to see who it was?

658
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:26,284
Yes! Yes, I couldn't.
But that's the thing, see.

659
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:28,745
I couldn't see anybody, and I thought
that Brad was out there.

660
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,997
But if you don't see anybody,
then you don't go outside!

661
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:32,791
Your little brother
was upstairs by himself.

662
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,251
- I know. I was freaking out.
- Right?

663
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:38,213
I know. I didn't,
I've never, I swear to God,

664
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:39,339
I never would
have done that.

665
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:40,674
I don't understand.
What happened?

666
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,218
It wasn't an accident because something
slammed the door behind me.

667
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:45,845
- We were worried sick about...
- What do you mean? Wait...

668
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,724
I took a nap, and I heard somebody
calling my name.

669
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:51,518
- What?
- I felt something,

670
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:54,688
like somebody was calling my name,
and I felt somebody there.

671
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:55,855
Are you sure you
weren't just dreaming?

672
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,190
You weren't there.
You didn't feel it.

673
00:55:57,315 --> 00:55:59,567
- The wind blew the door closed.
- There wasn't any wind.

674
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:02,946
All right? I don't want to hear any more
of this haunted house crap!

675
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,573
OK? That's enough. You guys are
driving me crazy.

676
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,950
End of story.

677
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,416
It was like you said,
with the pots falling.

678
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:15,625
- You know what?
- I was taking a nap,

679
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,712
- and something was calling my name.
- Sweetheart...

680
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:22,257
I'm just gonna go
calm him down, OK?

681
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:26,052
Just go upstairs
and try to go to bed, OK?

682
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:44,029
OK, buddy.

683
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:50,952
There you go. No, no, no.
You're eating breakfast now.

684
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:55,290
You want it
on here instead?

685
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:56,583
OK.

686
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,087
Morning.

687
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:03,256
Good morning.

688
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:10,430
Nice.

689
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:21,107
Bye, little buddy. Hot, hot, hot.

690
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:25,987
OK, Hunter. Got to eat.

691
00:57:26,154 --> 00:57:28,114
Got to eat. Come on, buddy.

692
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:34,454
I'm having these really
fucked up nightmares...

693
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:38,333
...which is not something
that's really new,

694
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,126
but I'm having different ones.

695
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:42,212
There was one in particular.
Well, there were...

696
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:45,882
I've had a couple dreams where my teeth
are falling out, which is really weird.

697
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:48,134
And there's one in particular,
where this guy is standing

698
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:50,178
at the foot of my bed...

699
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:54,432
...watching me sleep,
and it's not like a scary robber dream.

700
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:58,061
I can't see his face or anything,
but he was like...

701
00:57:58,186 --> 00:58:02,023
...about, like, a foot back...

702
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:08,113
...from the bed there. So...

703
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:11,157
That's what's been up.

704
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:14,119
I don't get it.
How can you not want a back rub?

705
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,745
Because I'm concentrating.

706
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:18,206
- But you know you love it.
- Stop.

707
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:21,710
But this site says that if it's,
like, really persistent,

708
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:26,089
which it is, obviously, at this point,
that it's probably not a ghost.

709
00:58:26,214 --> 00:58:29,968
It's probably something else.
And it's possibly a demon.

710
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:32,637
Well, what's the difference
between a demon and a ghost?

711
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:36,433
Because ghosts are dead people,

712
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,143
so they're, like, human energy.

713
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:41,813
And demons are not human.
They're just...

714
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,774
...like, evil.

715
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:47,652
Psyching yourself out,
looking online there.

716
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:48,820
I'm not psyching myself out.

717
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:50,196
Remember when I told you that my mom

718
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,490
thought she had that, like,
that flesh-eating disease?

719
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:54,534
She freaked herself out.
It's kinda like that, you know?

720
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:57,662
- Oh, my God. Babe, here.
- Let me see it.

721
00:58:58,496 --> 00:58:59,873
Like fourth paragraph down.

722
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:04,544
"It has been said that

723
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:07,464
if a human makes a bargain
with a demon for wealth,

724
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:09,549
power, or any other benefit,

725
00:59:09,674 --> 00:59:12,802
they must forfeit
their firstborn male.

726
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:15,221
If the debt is not honored,
the demon will follow the... "

727
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:17,557
Why are you smiling?
It's not funny.

728
00:59:18,516 --> 00:59:21,186
"... will follow the defaulter
and his or her brood

729
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:24,230
until its soul
of an infant is collected. "

730
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,276
So?

731
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:32,781
OK, so this is
the freakiest thing ever.

732
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:34,491
It happened to me last night.

733
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,076
This is the door...

734
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:41,539
...closing by itself.
That's me walking outside.

735
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:44,918
Yeah. Dad!
Will you come in here, please?!

736
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:47,712
OK, please stand over here
and watch this.

737
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,839
Jesus.

738
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:54,344
Don't look at me, look at the screen.

739
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,974
Yeah. The wind blows
the door closed.

740
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,434
- Dad.
- Thank you.

741
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:03,436
Are you serious?

742
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:06,398
- It's happened to me a million times.
- There's no wind!

743
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:08,274
The wind comes from the back
when the windows are open.

744
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:10,318
It's inside the house
and nothing else is open!

745
01:00:10,443 --> 01:00:12,696
Turn it off and stop
messing with the system.

746
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,197
Dad, there's obviously
something in the house!

747
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:15,323
Please, come on.

748
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:16,616
It's the same thing
Martine's been saying.

749
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:17,867
Come get your dinner. It's getting cold.

750
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,380
I think I just heard something
coming from downstairs.

751
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:22,015
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

752
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:26,269
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.

753
01:02:32,877 --> 01:02:34,254
Shit!

754
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,681
It woke me up.

755
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:47,976
Like, it sounded like
the door or something.

756
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:51,021
So I kind of checked it out
and Dad was snoring.

757
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:54,983
And... I caught it on here.
Do you want to see?

758
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:01,948
- Right there, you see?
- That's weird.

759
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:04,534
It's definitely weird.

760
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:07,412
It just freaks me out because
it just reminds me of like...

761
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:11,249
...what Martine was saying
about the house.

762
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:13,501
What did she say
about the house?

763
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:16,129
She said that there were
bad spirits in the house

764
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,673
that she had to clear out. She was
clearing out the bad spirits

765
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,593
and letting in the good spirits.
But something like that...

766
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:25,764
I don't have any other explanation for.
Do you?

767
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:28,308
I don't. I...

768
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:32,270
I remember being scared
all the time.

769
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:34,981
What do you mean "scared
all the time," though?

770
01:03:35,106 --> 01:03:38,109
- I don't know.
- No, but what do you mean?

771
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:41,821
- Like you felt, you felt scared...
- I don't remember.

772
01:03:41,988 --> 01:03:44,532
I mean,
I've been... I'm scared.

773
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:47,660
So what, did she,
like, lock herself out?

774
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:50,538
Well, she said the
door slammed shut on its own.

775
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:52,874
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

776
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:56,127
That's pretty darn creepy.

777
01:03:57,796 --> 01:03:58,797
Yeah.

778
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:03,843
Listen, this is gonna sound
totally crazy, and I know that, but...

779
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:05,929
I've been having this
feeling lately that,

780
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:08,556
that maybe whatever happened
to us when we were little...

781
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:10,350
I think it's starting again.

782
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:12,394
I don't want to talk about this, Kristi.

783
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,562
I don't remember anything.

784
01:04:14,729 --> 01:04:16,231
I just remember being
scared all the time. What...

785
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:19,943
You want to know what I remember?
I remember you crying all the time.

786
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:22,529
I remember you couldn't sleep,
and you got anxiety attacks.

787
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:25,031
I remember that you
stopped talking for months.

788
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:26,741
I remember weird people
came to our house

789
01:04:26,908 --> 01:04:29,077
and our mom was upset all the time.
That's what I remember.

790
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,246
Whatever it was, it thrived on fear.

791
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:34,124
The more we paid attention to it,
the worse it got.

792
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:36,376
You need to leave this alone.

793
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:38,878
You need to ignore it,
or you're gonna end up just like Mom.

794
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:40,380
Do you understand me?

795
01:04:41,464 --> 01:04:43,049
Do you understand me?

796
01:04:45,385 --> 01:04:48,013
Yeah, OK. I will.

797
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:06,322
Wanna go for a walk?
Abby.

798
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:08,074
Come on.

799
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,707
Oh, God!

800
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:54,431
God! Leave me alone!

801
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,585
Yo, Kris?

802
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:08,963
Are you OK?

803
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:12,092
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Did something just happen?

804
01:08:14,302 --> 01:08:17,138
...completely fine.
Everything is fine.

805
01:08:17,305 --> 01:08:18,765
Look at me.

806
01:08:21,309 --> 01:08:22,394
Kristi.

807
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:24,813
Honey, everything is fine.

808
01:08:24,938 --> 01:08:27,148
It's obviously not. Look at...

809
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:33,530
Your Aunt Katie said that we can't
talk about these things, OK?

810
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:36,866
Because if you do,
it just goes... worse.

811
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,993
- Listen.
- What do you mean?

812
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,997
Everything's fine. Ali, just stop.
Everything's fine.

813
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:44,833
OK.

814
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,837
No, but listen to me. That other
website said that some people...

815
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:52,966
...like, make deals with demons
for wealth and power.

816
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:56,386
So what if, what if
Kristi's great grandmother

817
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:59,222
made a deal with a demon
so she could get rich?

818
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:02,434
I went through the entire,

819
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,352
I went through
the entire family line.

820
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:08,773
And Hunter is the first male
to be born on Kristi's side

821
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:11,860
since, at least, the 1930s.

822
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:13,611
Don't tell me that shit
isn't coincidence.

823
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:03,495
Lie down.

824
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,209
Good girl.

825
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:39,924
- Dad?
- Yeah.

826
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,301
Did you hear that?

827
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:43,470
I heard something.
What the fuck?

828
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:47,724
Oh, God, it's Abby. Abby? Abby.

829
01:11:47,849 --> 01:11:49,893
- What's the matter, baby?
- Oh, my God.

830
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:51,394
- Oh, God.
- Is she OK?

831
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,772
Yeah. No, no, no. Honey,
grab my keys and stuff?

832
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:56,441
- Grab my shoes!
- What's going on?

833
01:11:56,566 --> 01:11:58,360
I don't know. There's something
wrong with Abby.

834
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,278
- Dad, I'm going with you!
- She's still breathing.

835
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:02,655
- What can I do? What should I do?
- Stay here with Hunter.

836
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:03,531
OK.

837
01:12:03,656 --> 01:12:04,657
And I'll call you
when we get there.

838
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:05,784
- OK.
- Oh, my God.

839
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,927
Just call me back
when you get this.

840
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,553
Let me know if she's OK.

841
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:28,515
OK, love you.

842
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:32,811
Hey...

843
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:35,855
Is she gonna be OK?

844
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:42,195
I love you. Bye.

845
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:43,149
Oh, God, please!
Let go of me!

846
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:55,203
No, don't! Hunter! Please!

847
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,538
Please!

848
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,247
No, I don't know. They thought
it was a seizure.

849
01:16:21,414 --> 01:16:24,292
No, she's never
had one before, ever.

850
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:26,878
- And she was making this noise.
- Ali?

851
01:16:27,003 --> 01:16:29,422
Babe, I got to call you
right back, OK?

852
01:16:29,547 --> 01:16:31,257
Honey, I'm really sorry
to do this to you.

853
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:32,801
I know this is
really bad timing.

854
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,344
There's something wrong
with Kristi, OK?

855
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:36,471
- I can't get her out of bed.
- What's wrong with her?

856
01:16:36,596 --> 01:16:38,515
...guys from Portland. I've been
putting them off for weeks.

857
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,642
- I can't blow them off.
- OK, please, listen to me.

858
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:42,227
Can I just take
Hunter to Brad's?

859
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:43,603
No, I need you to stay here.

860
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:44,562
And I'll come home
when you come home.

861
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,232
Honey, I know this sucks.
I do, I know, OK?

862
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:48,775
I know you're freaked
out and I'm really sorry.

863
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,735
I'll be there for like
two hours, all right?

864
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,655
And I have to pick
up Abby. OK?

865
01:16:53,822 --> 01:16:55,949
Please? I'm sorry, OK?

866
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:58,743
I... call me. I'll be, like, two hours.
If anything's wrong,

867
01:16:58,868 --> 01:17:00,453
just call me and
I'll be right here, OK?

868
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,371
OK.

869
01:17:01,496 --> 01:17:02,497
I just cannot
miss this today.

870
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:05,041
- Thank you. OK?
- OK, bye.

871
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:07,043
All right, don't worry. Lock
the door behind me, OK?

872
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:09,004
Yeah, I mean, obviously.

873
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:13,216
No, I put him down.
He's sleeping.

874
01:17:14,634 --> 01:17:16,720
She's not here.
She's still at the vet's.

875
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:22,142
No, 'cause they have to run tests 'cause
they don't know what it was.

876
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:24,853
Brad, it was...
like fucking...

877
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:28,231
I've never heard
her cry like that.

878
01:17:28,356 --> 01:17:31,276
Or just tell them that you want to come
over for an hour.

879
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:32,527
Please?

880
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:38,033
Please. No, I just don't
want to be here alone.

881
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:40,410
Yeah, well, basically.
She's sick or something.

882
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:44,998
OK. OK, bye.
Love you, too. Bye.

883
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:42,764
Oh, my God.

884
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,645
OK, so, just found this
on the basement door.

885
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,857
Um... I don't really know
where it came from.

886
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:55,568
I think that that's blood,
but I can't really tell.

887
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:59,114
This comes up pretty high.
I don't think she could get up there.

888
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,866
It kind of looks like letters,
but I don't really know what it means.

889
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:13,962
What the fuck is that?

890
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:30,770
Kristi?

891
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:39,237
Kristi?

892
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:42,532
Hey, sweetpea.

893
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:43,867
What's going on?

894
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,245
Come here, sweetie.

895
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,414
Oh, yeah.

896
01:19:49,539 --> 01:19:51,332
Dad?

897
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:54,961
You have to come home right now. Dad,
you have to come home.

898
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:58,131
Something is really
wrong with Kristi. Please!

899
01:19:58,298 --> 01:20:01,301
Please,
come home, please.

900
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:04,721
Please, just, please, come home.
Please. Please.

901
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:10,685
Kristi?

902
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:16,358
Kristi? Hunter's crying.

903
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:22,489
Don't touch him!

904
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:33,249
What the fuck?

905
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:35,835
What the fuck?

906
01:20:38,713 --> 01:20:40,215
- Are you OK?
- No!

907
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:43,426
- Oh, my. Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

908
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:45,345
She's in Hunter's room.
You can't go up there!

909
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,055
- I have to see if she's OK.
- You can't go up there!

910
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,348
You have to
look at the tape!

911
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:50,016
- I have to check on Hunter.
- She got attacked!

912
01:20:50,183 --> 01:20:52,143
You have to watch the tape! Please!

913
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:53,895
Please, please,
just listen to me!

914
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:58,692
Dad, we have to go right now.

915
01:20:59,901 --> 01:21:04,280
Fuck. Dad? Dad, look at me.
Do you believe me now?

916
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:07,158
Come on! We can't stay here! Please!

917
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,869
Dad!

918
01:21:22,298 --> 01:21:23,633
What are you doing?

919
01:21:23,758 --> 01:21:25,385
She tried to warn me,
and I wouldn't listen.

920
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:28,096
Wait, who are you talking about?

921
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,473
Dad, who are you talking about?

922
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:33,977
What?

923
01:21:37,522 --> 01:21:38,523
Olive oil?

924
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,199
What?

925
01:21:48,908 --> 01:21:50,326
What am I gonna do with this?

926
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:53,913
- This is gonna knock her out?
- Si.

927
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,585
I told you to stay here.

928
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,337
OK, you're kind of freaking
me out right now, OK?

929
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:01,963
Can you please talk to me?

930
01:22:03,381 --> 01:22:05,633
Dad, look at her leg.
Look at the bite.

931
01:22:08,845 --> 01:22:10,680
What the fuck?!

932
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:16,311
No, no. No way, no way.

933
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,438
We can't do this to her.
It's her family.

934
01:22:18,563 --> 01:22:19,981
- Please, please...
- What am I supposed to do?!

935
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:22,609
It's Kristi's fucking sister!
We can't do that to her!

936
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:24,986
We can't do this.
We cannot do this to her.

937
01:22:25,153 --> 01:22:27,364
Look, there is no other way.

938
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:29,491
Yes, there is. We can transfer
it to somebody else.

939
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:31,326
- No, we can't. No, we can't.
- That's what we have to do.

940
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:33,370
OK? Martine said it had
to be a blood relative.

941
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:35,372
OK? That's my wife
and my son!

942
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:38,166
- That is your little baby brother!
- Do we tell her?

943
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,168
- Do we tell her what happened?
- No, we never tell anyone.

944
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:41,795
She's not even
gonna remember, OK?

945
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:43,713
Martine said she's not
gonna remember, OK?

946
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:45,340
And we're not gonna
talk about it, ever!

947
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:48,134
And I don't care if you
agree with me or not, OK?

948
01:22:48,259 --> 01:22:49,969
It's my decision!
I'm doing it!

949
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:51,846
What...?

950
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:58,520
Let's go, please.

951
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:01,314
Please, Dad.

952
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:04,234
Dad?

953
01:23:06,861 --> 01:23:09,948
Dad, please, please, be careful. Please.

954
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,284
Kristi?

955
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,496
Kristi?

956
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:19,165
Dad!

957
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,214
Dad! I can't see anything! Dad?!

958
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,008
- Ali, where are you?
- I'm right here!

959
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:29,175
Where are you?!

960
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,885
I'm right here! I'm right here!

961
01:23:31,052 --> 01:23:32,887
- Here, here, take it.
- Fuck.

962
01:23:34,764 --> 01:23:36,516
Fuck! Where's the...

963
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:39,394
Where's the baby?!

964
01:23:41,312 --> 01:23:42,981
I don't know!

965
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:45,483
Dad, let's get out of here! Come on!

966
01:23:45,608 --> 01:23:47,569
OK, OK.

967
01:23:55,076 --> 01:23:56,578
Stay right there, OK? Just stay there.

968
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:58,371
- No! No, no!
- Stay there!

969
01:23:58,538 --> 01:23:59,998
Just stay behind me, OK?
Just stay right there!

970
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:02,167
OK. OK.

971
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:05,628
What's happening?!

972
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:08,590
Oh, my God.

973
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:16,848
Ali!

974
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:20,101
Oh, my God!

975
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:23,146
- They're in the basement.
- Are you OK?

976
01:24:23,271 --> 01:24:26,107
- Dad?
- Just, just stay there! OK.

977
01:24:45,502 --> 01:24:47,587
Dad. Dad.

978
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:50,840
- Just stay here. OK?
- OK.

979
01:24:57,013 --> 01:24:58,390
Hunter!

980
01:25:01,559 --> 01:25:03,186
Oh, Jesus.

981
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:06,940
I can't see anything.

982
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:11,027
What the fuck?

983
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,377
Jesus! Fuck!

984
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:35,218
Oh! Fuck!

985
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:36,970
Hunter!

986
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:43,393
Damn it.

987
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,244
I almost gotcha. Almost gotcha.

988
01:26:01,369 --> 01:26:03,538
OK, I got you. Oh, God.

989
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:06,332
I got you, little buddy.
Are you OK?

990
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:09,336
OK, you stay there.

991
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,263
All right. Are you ready?
You're gonna like this.

992
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:45,557
I am ready,
I'm thrilled. I'm excited.

993
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:49,060
Is it a tie? Is it...?
Oh! Shocking!

994
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:52,981
So how are things... here?
Is there any more weird stuff

995
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:54,983
- going on or, you know?
- No.

996
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:57,068
- No?
- Everything's great.

997
01:27:57,193 --> 01:28:00,405
Good. I must be losing
my mind. I just...

998
01:28:02,073 --> 01:28:03,783
I feel like there's stuff
going on at our house,

999
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,660
to the point where I actually
told Micah about it,

1000
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:07,704
and I'm sure he thinks I'm crazy.

1001
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:09,622
You should take your own advice.

1002
01:28:09,748 --> 01:28:12,542
We shouldn't talk about this
stuff. It just drives us nuts.

1003
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:15,086
- You're right.
- Sis?

1004
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:16,671
Goodbye, Hunter!

1005
01:28:16,796 --> 01:28:19,299
- I love you, little fella!
- Bye, Auntie!

1006
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:22,802
- Bye, sis. See you soon.
- All right.

1007
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:26,389
What is that?

1008
01:28:26,514 --> 01:28:27,974
Hello, baby.

1009
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:29,517
Hi.

1010
01:28:30,727 --> 01:28:32,645
Is that what I think it is?

1011
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:34,356
Yeah, it's... I don't know
what you think it is,

1012
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:35,982
but whatever it is,
it's pretty sweet.

1013
01:28:36,107 --> 01:28:37,734
I think it's a giant-ass camera.

1014
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:40,236
What happened to, like,
the little handheld?

1015
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:42,489
Easy to move around, versatile.

1016
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:45,492
Are you gonna park the car or are you
gonna stand there, looking at me?

1017
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:48,870
This is... big and impressive,

1018
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,831
and it has a really bright light on it.

1019
01:28:51,956 --> 01:28:54,042
- Kiss the camera, will you?
- I'm not kissing the camera.

1020
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:56,086
- Come on.
- How much did this cost you?

1021
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:57,587
- What?
- How much did...

1022
01:28:57,712 --> 01:28:59,673
I'll kiss you, but I'm not
gonna kiss the camera.

1023
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:29,202
