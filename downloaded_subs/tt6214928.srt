1
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,000
To whom it may concern.

2
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:20,700
My name is Wilfred Leland James,
and this is my confession.

3
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:36,400
The issue that led to my crime
and damnation...

4
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:41,766
was 100 acres of good land
in Hemingford Home, Nebraska...

5
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,700
willed to my wife,
Arlette Christina Winters James.

6
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:50,100
Following the death of her father.

7
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:56,533
It was much my intention to add her 100
to our 80-acre freehold farm,

8
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,300
as it was to someday
pass it all on to my boy,

9
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,600
Henry Freeman James,

10
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,133
and to his thereafter.

11
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,633
- Now, you can still find reverse?
- Yes, sir.

12
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,766
Show me.

13
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,666
- The middle one.
- All right. All right, you're ready.

14
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,366
Maybe not for Omaha just yet or...

15
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:29,400
Even Lincoln, but... you take her slow...
in Hemingford Home

16
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,766
and you ought to be just fine.

17
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,133
All right? What'd I say?

18
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:33,566
Uh...

19
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,433
- Slow.
- Slow.

20
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,533
In 1922, a man's pride was a man's land.

21
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,533
And so was his son.

22
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Mm.

23
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,600
It's not too sour.

24
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,733
Not too sweet.

25
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,566
Nope.

26
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
It's just right.

27
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,033
My wife...

28
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,333
who never did take to the farming life,

29
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,200
wished to cash in her new land

30
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,300
She wanted us to leave all this behind.

31
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,433
So, what do you propose we do
with all this money and no land?

32
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,066
We could move.

33
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,166
To Omaha.

34
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,633
Or even St. Louis.

35
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,166
Cities are for fools.

36
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,033
Ma, I agree with Pa.

37
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,500
I don't wanna live in Omaha or any city.

38
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,000
We can talk about this after supper.

39
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:32,133
If we can't agree,
you should go on to your mother's.

40
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,266
And leave you
my father's land, I suppose?

41
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,133
That'll never happen, Wilf.

42
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Well...

43
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
then...

44
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,466
you let me buy that land from you.

45
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,500
How are you gonna do that?

46
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,200
It'd have to be over a period of time.

47
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,033
Eight years.

48
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,166
Perhaps ten, but I'll pay you, Arlette.
I'll pay you every cent.

49
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,233
A little money coming in
is worse than none.

50
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,700
Farringtons will buy it outright.

51
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,566
Their idea of top dollar
is apt to be far more generous than yours.

52
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,200
Anyway, I've had an idea of my own.

53
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,766
We sell the 100 acres and the farm
to the Farrington combine.

54
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,766
They'd buy it all just to get that close
to the railway line.

55
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:25,733
And then...

56
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,466
we split the money.

57
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Divorce.

58
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
We both know that's what you want.

59
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,666
And, uh...

60
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:45,466
who, uh...?

61
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,700
Which one of us would the boy go with?

62
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Me.

63
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,633
Of course.
A boy of 14 needs to be with his mother.

64
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,333
Now, that ain't fair on him, Arlette.

65
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,633
Now, you taking him away
from everything he knows.

66
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,433
- You would do that?
- Fair? Fair?

67
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:12,466
Life is rarely fair, Wilf.

68
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,066
Especially out here.

69
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:19,566
Hmm.

70
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,433
All right, I need a little...

71
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,700
Just give me a little time
to think that all over.

72
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:10,666
As a husband, I thought of going
to the law on the matter.

73
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,433
And yet something held me back.

74
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,266
It was not fear of neighbors chatter
or country gossip.

75
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,400
No, it was something else.

76
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,500
I had come to hate her.

77
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That was what held me back.

78
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,500
Goddamn it, Wilf.
You scared the life out of me.

79
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
What?

80
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,566
I've decided
that you won't be selling them 100 acres.

81
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,366
Oh, have you?

82
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,633
Not without a fight.

83
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:16,400
The Farringtons
will bring the fight to you, Wilf.

84
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,133
Right to you. And I'll happi...

85
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:03,466
And I believe that there's another man...

86
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,033
inside of every man.

87
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:15,766
A stranger.

88
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,233
A conniving man.

89
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,533
Henry?

90
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:38,333
What you doing down here, bo...?

91
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,733
Shannon.

92
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,133
Mr. James.

93
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,333
Why don't you head on home, girl?
I need a word with Henry.

94
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Yes, sir.

95
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:53,733
See you tomorrow.

96
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:55,700
See you tomorrow.

97
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:00,000
What do you want, Pa?

98
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:04,533
That spring Henry
had grown sweet

99
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,133
on the Cotterie girl from next door.

100
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,766
I've been meaning to pluck these
for a while now.

101
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,233
Henry, they're...

102
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,433
They're beautiful.

103
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:17,566
Heh.

104
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,233
Let's find a vase.

105
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,166
And the conniving man thought
he might use this to his advantage.

106
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:39,766
Shannon wouldn't be
in your life anymore.

107
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,233
Of course, neither would I.

108
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,600
Papa, what are we gonna do?

109
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Well...

110
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,433
Sometimes the only thing to do...

111
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:55,433
is... to take the thing
that you must have.

112
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,233
No...

113
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,466
Even if somebody get hurt.

114
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,366
Even if someone dies.

115
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,066
Papa?

116
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,266
Well...

117
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:11,766
If she was gone...

118
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:16,366
well, everything would be the way it was.

119
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:20,066
And all the arguments, that would cease.

120
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,300
We could live here peacefully.

121
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:40,566
I've offered her everything I can
to make her go, and she won't go.

122
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,733
There's only one thing I can do.

123
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,666
That... we can do.

124
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
Henry!

125
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,133
Give your mama a kiss.

126
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:13,466
What's wrong with you?

127
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,666
Nothing, Ma.

128
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,566
I'm fine.

129
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,166
Can I have some beer?

130
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,166
You can finish that off.

131
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,700
But no more of this tomorrow.

132
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,533
Nor the day after, mind.

133
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,333
Well, a murdered man or a woman

134
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:20,566
dies not on God's time
but on man's.

135
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,000
And if she is cut short
before atoning for sin,

136
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,233
well...

137
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,633
all errors must be forgiven.

138
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,566
But what about us, Pa?

139
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,333
Wouldn't we go to hell?

140
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,500
How can you say so
when you see heaven all around us?

141
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,066
Yet she means to drive us away from it.

142
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,133
And think.

143
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,600
If she does go to Omaha... Well...

144
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,266
she'll be digging her an even deeper pit
in Sheol.

145
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,666
If she takes you...

146
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,200
you'll become a city boy.

147
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,433
Yeah. Just forget all this and...

148
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,733
and start learning city ways.

149
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,066
Begin digging your own pit.

150
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Eat or starve, Henry.

151
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:29,733
The choice is yours.

152
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:34,666
And you, you just sit there.

153
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,733
Leave off.

154
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,642
- What did you say?
- I said...

155
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,333
leave off, so we can be a family again.

156
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:55,366
The lawyer assures me the land is mine...

157
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,233
to do with as I wish.

158
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:00,366
And I'm gonna sell.

159
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:05,133
Now, you can sit here
and smell roasting hogs,

160
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,099
cook your own dinner, make your own bed.

161
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,066
But you, my son,
are coming with me to Omaha.

162
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,566
I am gonna open a dress shop.

163
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,366
That's my idea of fair.

164
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,133
Don't fool with me, Wilf.

165
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,233
I'm not now. Henry and I have had
many conversations about this.

166
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,133
He wants to go.

167
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,400
Least try it on for size.

168
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:10,200
And I thought I might look for work
as a mechanic.

169
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,466
Cars and trucks, but...

170
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,333
Farm machinery mostly. You know.

171
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,166
If I can keep that old Farmall running,
hell...

172
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,533
I guess I can keep anything running.

173
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
You're not fooling?

174
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,166
And Henry talked you into this?

175
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,066
Yeah. He convinced me...

176
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,733
it'd be better to...

177
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,566
take a chance at being happy in town

178
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,766
than to stay out here on my own
in, uh, what would be...

179
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,266
sure misery.

180
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,633
Whoo!

181
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,400
The boy talks sense and the man listens?

182
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,333
At long last.

183
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Hallelujah.

184
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,366
Either that or a hit in the head.

185
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,300
That's not too bad. No.

186
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,400
Henry, come out here!
Let's celebrate.

187
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,600
- Henry.
- Stop.

188
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Finally we're all together.

189
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:20,533
- My men see sense.
- All right. Stop.

190
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Oh!

191
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:23,566
Shoot.

192
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,333
If you're good, Wilf,
you can suck it out of the cloth later on.

193
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,633
Oh, no need to be so prissy.
I've seen you with Shannon Cotterie.

194
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,200
Pretty face and a nice little figure.

195
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Mm.

196
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
If you're not getting a touch of that,
you're a fool.

197
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:45,666
Just be careful. Fourteen's not too young
to marry out here in the middle.

198
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,333
Oh. Yes, ma'am.

199
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,200
Here's to Shannon Cotterie
and her future bubbies,

200
00:19:56,266 --> 00:20:00,366
and if my son don't know the color
of her nipples, he's a slowpoke.

201
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,333
Make sure when you're laying down
with her in the corn

202
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,433
or behind the barn that you're a no poke.

203
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:10,633
Explore all you like
and, you know, rub it with your Johnny Mac

204
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,266
until he feels good and spits up.

205
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
But you stay out of the home place...

206
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,300
lest you get locked in
like your mummer and daddy.

207
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,666
Gotcha.

208
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,666
Get off.

209
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,766
I just wanna go to sleep.

210
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,266
Off you will.

211
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:46,766
All right.

212
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,233
Nearly there.

213
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,233
Almost there.

214
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
There we go.

215
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,533
She can't say those things about Shannon.

216
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh, but she will.

217
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,233
It's just how she is.

218
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,166
And you know that.

219
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,766
Hell, that's how the good Lord made her.

220
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,666
All right?

221
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:12,066
And she'll split you and Shannon up, too.
I guarantee that.

222
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,566
If we let her.

223
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,300
Couldn't you get your own lawyer?

224
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,566
You think the kind that I can afford...

225
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,233
could stand up to them lawyers
that Farrington would throw at us?

226
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,766
And she'd want that 100 acres, too.

227
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,433
And she means for them to have it.

228
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,033
This is the only way, boy.

229
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,533
But you've got to help me.

230
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Will you?

231
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,433
I just wish there was another way.

232
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:58,766
Me, too, son.

233
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,733
Me, too.

234
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,766
This is our house.

235
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:11,233
This is where we belong.

236
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,466
Are you willing to fight for it, boy?

237
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,233
Are you willing to fight for it?

238
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:37,733
Can't you...?

239
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't know...

240
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:42,766
with a pillow or something?

241
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
It would be too slow.

242
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,400
Too painful.

243
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,066
She'd struggle.

244
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:21,566
We'll send her to heaven?

245
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,100
Shh.

246
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,200
It'll be quick.

247
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,666
Come on, boy.

248
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,066
Go on.

249
00:24:58,633 --> 00:24:59,700
Goodbye, Mama.

250
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Goodbye.

251
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,066
No.

252
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,400
Hold her down. Hold her down.

253
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,400
Goddamn it.

254
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:28,666
All right. Get out of here.

255
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,109
- We've gotta move her over.
- Let me go!

256
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,293
Get out of the way.

257
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,700
In 1922...

258
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,266
I murdered my wife.

259
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:02,766
My son...

260
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,200
aided me.

261
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
This is a thing I regret...

262
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,700
even more bitterly than the crime...

263
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,466
for the reasons
that this document will show.

264
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
All right.

265
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,266
Almost there.

266
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,333
That's no grave.

267
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,400
- That's no grave for Mama.
- Boy...

268
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,133
Henry.

269
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,033
Henry.

270
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:56,666
Boy.

271
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Boy?

272
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,400
Okay, darling.

273
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:27,533
Come here.

274
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:30,766
Go on in the house.

275
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Get both wash buckets out of the pantry.

276
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,433
You might as well get them milk buckets
from the barn, too.

277
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:43,033
Fill them up from the kitchen pump...

278
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,433
and suds them up with that stuff
she keeps in the kitchen.

279
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,066
Under the sink. Go.

280
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:51,133
Should I heat the water?

281
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:54,433
No.

282
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,533
Cold water.

283
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,033
It's best for blood.

284
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Go on.

285
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,333
I discovered something that night
that most people never have to learn.

286
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:11,633
Murder is sin.

287
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,033
Murder is damnation.

288
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:18,100
But murder is also work.

289
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:57,333
I don't think I can go to school today,
Papa.

290
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:01,033
I think people might see it on my face.
Shannon especially.

291
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:04,766
You can go to school Monday.

292
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,400
Tell the teacher you had the grippe,

293
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:10,600
didn't wanna spread it
to the rest of the class.

294
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,033
Oh, shit!

295
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,133
Hey!

296
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,466
Get away from her!

297
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,500
In those days,
all sorts of things happened on farms

298
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,500
out in what we called the middle.

299
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,033
Things that went unremarked,
yet alone reported.

300
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:47,266
In those days...

301
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,600
a man's wife was considered
a man's business.

302
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,400
And if she disappeared...

303
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,333
well, there was an end to it.

304
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,000
Taking them all would have been a mistake.

305
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,233
She had left on foot
and only taken what she could carry.

306
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,366
Why hadn't she taken the T?

307
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,733
Because I would have heard her start it
and stopped her going.

308
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,500
Wilfred James?

309
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,133
Andrew Lester. Attorney at law.

310
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,233
Well, before I shake that...

311
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:26,433
you'd best tell me
whose lawyer you are there, Mr. Lester.

312
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:31,766
I'm currently being retained
by the Farrington Livestock Company

313
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:34,133
of Chicago, Omaha and Des Moines.

314
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:38,400
Well, in that case,
you can just go on and put that hand away.

315
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:39,466
No offense.

316
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:41,633
How are you, Lars?

317
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,133
Tolerable fair.

318
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,466
But dry. I could use a drink.

319
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:46,333
Well, go on. You know where it is.

320
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,233
Sweet and cold as ever, I guess.

321
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,700
Mm.

322
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,633
I could use a drink myself, Mr. James.

323
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,266
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

324
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,300
Mending fence is hot work.

325
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,533
Not as hot as riding 20 miles
in Lars' truck, though, I'll bet.

326
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Whoo.

327
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,566
My sit-upon may never be the same.

328
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,266
Perhaps we could drink it inside,
Mr. James.

329
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,199
- It would be a little cooler.
- It would,

330
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:19,033
but I'd no more invite you inside
than I'd shake your hand.

331
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,366
- Hello, Mr. Olsen.
- Henry.

332
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:35,600
I imagine you're here on business, yeah.
My wife's.

333
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,333
I am.

334
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:39,333
Well, why would she send you?

335
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,066
Your wife didn't send me, Mr. James.

336
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:44,066
In point of fact,
I came here to look for her.

337
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:47,000
Mm. Well, that proves it then.

338
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:51,566
Proves what?

339
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,633
She absconded, Mr. Lester.

340
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:55,466
Decamped.

341
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,700
Did a midnight flit.

342
00:34:57,766 --> 00:34:59,333
Whatever you want to call it.

343
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Yep.

344
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,633
But, uh...

345
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,100
I'd have to say...

346
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,433
it sounded to me
like she got as tired of you fellows

347
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
as she did of me.

348
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,566
And the son she gave birth to. Good day.

349
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,600
You... You'll pardon me for saying...

350
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,533
but this all seems very strange to me,
Mr. James.

351
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,033
Very strange indeed,

352
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,133
considering the amount of money
my client is willing to pay

353
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,280
for that piece of property.

354
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:34,000
Let's just say
trying to nail that woman down...

355
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,166
is like trying to nail jelly to the floor.

356
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:41,533
Could I look in the house?

357
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Oh!

358
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:45,366
Hey, Henry.

359
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,100
Tell this man where's your mama.

360
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:52,766
I... I don't know, Pa.

361
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,366
Well, don't tell me. Tell him.

362
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:59,766
Well... you called me out for breakfast
Friday morning...

363
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,100
and that was it.

364
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,533
She was gone. Packed and gone.

365
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,133
Is that the truth, son?

366
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,166
Yes, sir.

367
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:16,033
Can I go back inside? Got schoolwork
to make up from being sick.

368
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,542
Go. Remember it's your turn to milk.

369
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,566
Yes, sir.

370
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,166
This isn't finished.

371
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,333
Did I do it all right, Papa?

372
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,600
You did perfect, son.

373
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:34,633
Are we gonna get caught?

374
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Are we going to jail?

375
00:36:36,466 --> 00:36:39,100
- When are we gonna fill in the well?
- Not yet.

376
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:41,766
But why?

377
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,033
You know...

378
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,400
it's only a matter of time
before he brings Sheriff Jones out there.

379
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,166
A filled in well might make him suspicious
about why it got filled in,

380
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,666
so recent and all.

381
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,600
But one that's still being filled in...

382
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,433
And for good reason.

383
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:08,533
Turn around and watch her ass.

384
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:11,366
Come on.

385
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:12,633
That's it. Come on.

386
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,066
- Come on.
- Pa, we can't...

387
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,400
Come on.

388
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:32,066
Now what?

389
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,066
Make her stop.

390
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,400
Do something!

391
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:41,366
Good day, gents.

392
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,766
Hard choring this afternoon, is it?

393
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:48,233
It's my own damn fault.

394
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,333
One of our cows
fell in the old livestock well.

395
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,166
- Is that so?
- Yes, it is.

396
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,200
Glass of lemonade, sheriff?

397
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,066
It's Arlette's.

398
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,266
Did she decide to come back now?

399
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,666
No. She took her favorite clothes but...

400
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:06,133
she left the lemonade.

401
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:08,100
Henry, go in our house,

402
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,566
- get the... sheriff a glass.
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

403
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,033
Come on up, get some shade.

404
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,333
Shade sounds good,
but I believe I'll stand.

405
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:20,133
Yeah, I guess you know
that I'm not out here on my own hook.

406
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,566
I'm surprised you ain't got Lester
hiding there in the back of your truck.

407
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,133
He wanted to come,
but I put the kibosh on that.

408
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:30,633
He also said he wanted a search warrant,
but I told him he didn't need one.

409
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,433
I said... you'd either let me look around
or you wouldn't.

410
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:39,033
I didn't let him in the house
because I took against him.

411
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,566
Of course,
I'd have taken against John Apostle

412
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:46,000
if he came out here
batting for Cole Farrington's team.

413
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:51,533
Yep.

414
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:56,566
Lovely room.

415
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,700
Gets the early light, doesn't it?

416
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,733
Well... stays cool most afternoons,
you know...

417
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,333
Sun's on the other side.

418
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Here you go.

419
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
There we go.

420
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,066
- Lot of duds.
- Yeah.

421
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,700
Arlette liked her clothes...
and her mail-order catalogs.

422
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,366
But, uh... since she only took
the one suitcase...

423
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:24,409
- We've got two. See the other one...
- Right.

424
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,473
- ...in the back corner right there?
- Yeah.

425
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:30,600
I'd have to say,
she only took the ones she liked the best.

426
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,100
See, she had two pairs of pants...

427
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,333
and she had... a pair of blue denims...

428
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
and those are gone.

429
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,166
But, uh...

430
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,566
she didn't much care for pants.

431
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,466
Well, pants are good for traveling in,
though. Aren't they?

432
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:48,633
Man or woman,
pants are good for traveling in.

433
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:51,666
A woman might choose them.
If she was in a hurry, that is.

434
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,466
I suppose.

435
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:58,333
Well, uh...

436
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,166
She did take her good jewelry and, uh...

437
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,600
her picture of Nana and Pop-Pop.

438
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Did she now?

439
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,300
Well, I suppose she would, wouldn't she?

440
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:10,766
Nice room.

441
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,733
Nice house.
Woman would have to be crazy

442
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,509
to leave a nice room,
a nice house like this one.

443
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:18,533
Well, uh... Mama always talked
about the city a lot.

444
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,500
Uh, she had this idea
to open up a dress shop.

445
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:25,466
- Did she?
- Yes, sir.

446
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,066
But, uh... that would take some money
doing something like that, wouldn't it?

447
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,400
Well, she got them acres from her father.

448
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:41,933
Seems to be a pair
of woman's shoes under there.

449
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:47,600
Broke in, too.
The kind that'd be good for traveling.

450
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:51,266
Don't suppose she, uh, ran away barefooty,
do you?

451
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,233
Hmm.

452
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
No, I think she took her canvas shoes.

453
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,633
Anyway, those are the ones that are gone.

454
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,700
Well...

455
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:10,333
Well, someone must have come along...

456
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:14,000
picked her up, given her a ride...
before her head cleared.

457
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:16,300
- That'd be my guess.
- Yep, mine, too. Mine, too.

458
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Well, sheriff...

459
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:21,633
if we're done in here now...
me and my boy better get back to work.

460
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,733
That useless well should have been
filled in three years ago.

461
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:30,300
Yeah, an old cow of mine
got out of the barn.

462
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Elphis.

463
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Her name was Elphis.

464
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,533
She got out of the barn
and decided to take a stroll on the cap.

465
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,633
Yup.

466
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,333
Didn't have the good grace
to die on her own either.

467
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,400
I had to shoot her.

468
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
Go on. Come on back, I'll show you.

469
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:45,100
Right, no, no. Another time.

470
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,500
Thanks for the lemonade
and for being so gracious.

471
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:50,366
Could've been a lot less so,
considering who sent me here.

472
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:52,033
Oh, no. It's all right, sheriff.

473
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,500
We all have got our jobs.

474
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:02,466
He didn't even wanna look.

475
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,633
If God rewards us on earth
for good deeds...

476
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:20,500
then maybe Satan rewards us for evil ones.

477
00:44:26,566 --> 00:44:30,466
I can't say for sure,
but that was a good summer.

478
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,166
Plenty of heat and sun for the corn
and just enough rain.

479
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:37,166
Got a ways to go.

480
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,366
Come to papa.

481
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,733
Henry wasn't always unsmiling
that summer,

482
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,566
and Shannon Cotterie was the reason why.

483
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,200
Mr. James?

484
00:44:58,633 --> 00:44:59,633
Darling.

485
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:01,166
Is...?

486
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:02,433
Is Henry sick?

487
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,033
Sick?

488
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:06,500
The boy's as healthy as a horse.

489
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:09,300
He kind of eats like one, too, don't he?

490
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,066
Yeah.

491
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,233
I know. It's just...

492
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,400
He's different.

493
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:19,233
I... I always used to know
what he was thinking, but...

494
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:21,100
now I don't anymore.

495
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,366
He broods.

496
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,733
- Does he?
- Yeah.

497
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:28,233
You haven't seen it?

498
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Gosh, uh...

499
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:34,266
he seems like his old self to me.

500
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,433
But he cares for you, Shannon.

501
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:42,666
An awful lot, darling.

502
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,100
So, maybe what looks like brooding to you
feels like lovesick to him. Hmm?

503
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:53,333
Yeah. I know, I've thought of that, but...

504
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Mr. James, if...

505
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,466
If he was, say, sweet on someone else,
one of those girls from school...

506
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,033
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

507
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:04,466
Shannon...

508
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:08,366
any summer's a hardworking time.

509
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,500
And with Arlette gone...

510
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,366
me and Hank been busier
than one-armed paper hangers.

511
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:19,666
So... he hardly has time to spark you,
let alone some other girl.

512
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:22,400
Yeah. No, I just...

513
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,333
He's so quiet now...

514
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:27,733
so moody.

515
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,100
Sometimes I have to say his name twice
or even three times

516
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:34,433
before he hears it and answers.
And I'm trying to...

517
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:39,366
The only thing you need to worry about
is putting him back in his place

518
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:40,533
should he get out of it.

519
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,666
Boys...
get pretty steamed up, you know.

520
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:45,733
Right?

521
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:48,133
Yeah.

522
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Mr. James...

523
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,466
I'm... I'm real sorry about Mrs. James.

524
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:19,700
I know you think I'll slip to Shannon
or that sheriff, but...

525
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:22,266
you don't have to worry about me.

526
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:25,333
All right now. That's enough now, Henry.
Go to bed.

527
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:27,266
Hank.

528
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,266
She hated it when you'd call me that.

529
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,333
All right, Hank.

530
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:40,266
Go to bed.

531
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:49,233
The pipe led to one place
and one place only.

532
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:12,000
Pa? What happened?

533
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:17,666
I just thought I heard a fox
trying to get in the barn.

534
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:18,733
A fox?

535
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:22,066
- I haven't seen a fox for...
- Back to bed, Hank.

536
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,266
Down in the dark they would die.

537
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,166
If not of suffocation, then...

538
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:19,666
Henry returned from school later that day

539
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:21,533
and brought with him some news.

540
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:31,400
She's 15 years old, boy.

541
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:33,066
Others get married that young.

542
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:36,600
Christ. I got no money
to give you a start. You understand?

543
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:40,500
Maybe by '25,
if crops and prices stay good,

544
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:43,433
- but right now, there ain't nothing...
- There would be enough!

545
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,000
If you hadn't been such a bugger
about that 100 acres, there'd be plenty!

546
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:50,466
She would've given me some of it.

547
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:55,233
- She wouldn't have talked to me this way.
- She would've talked to you much worse.

548
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,566
And laughed.

549
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:00,500
Your mother told you...

550
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:03,100
to keep your willy in your pants. Hmm?

551
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:09,100
And although it was as crude and hurtful
as most of what she had to say...

552
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,533
- you should have followed it.
- Mom would've helped me fix it.

553
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:14,700
Money fixes everything.

554
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:24,166
You better make yourself scarce.

555
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:28,100
You forget how tight your mama was
with a dollar

556
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,200
and you forget too fast for your own good.

557
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,100
I'm gonna do my best for you, son.

558
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:37,433
You'd better.

559
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:47,700
Harlan Cotterie prospered more
than most farmers

560
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:51,400
in the years 1916 to 1922.

561
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,033
- It's a beast.
- Mm-hm.

562
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,300
And Harlan had always been good to me.

563
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,433
I'd always considered us
not just neighbors,

564
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,533
but good friends.

565
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:06,500
Yet in that moment I hated him.

566
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:10,700
Not because he'd come out to tax me
about my son.

567
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
No.

568
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:17,233
It was that shiny blue Cadillac he had.

569
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,733
It was the new barn painted bright red.

570
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:24,000
It was the indoor plumbing.

571
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,633
But most of all...

572
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:31,433
it was that plain-faced, biddable wife
whose sweetly given reply

573
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,166
to any problem would be:

574
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,733
Whatever you think is best, dear.

575
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:38,266
First, and right away, she's gonna go

576
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:42,200
to the St. Eusebia Catholic Home for Girls
in Omaha.

577
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:44,706
She doesn't know it yet,
but it's gonna happen. It'll be good.

578
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,466
Sounds like some kind of orphanage.

579
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:49,600
It's not an orphanage.

580
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:54,566
It's a clean, wholesome and busy place.

581
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:55,633
So I've been told.

582
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:59,500
She'll have chores, get her schooling,
in four months she'll have her baby.

583
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:02,566
Then we'll give that kid up for adoption,
then she can come home.

584
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,633
What's my part in all this?

585
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,766
I assume I must have one.

586
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:12,300
Are you smarting on me, Wilf?
Look, I know you've had a tough year,

587
00:53:12,366 --> 00:53:15,566
- but I will not bear you smarting on me.
- I'm not smarting on you,

588
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:19,133
but you need to know
you're not the only one who's mad...

589
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,000
and ashamed.

590
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:25,700
Just tell me what you want.

591
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:29,033
All right.

592
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,300
I know you're not a rich man...

593
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:36,066
but it's time you step up
and take share of the responsibility.

594
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:39,100
The time at that home
is gonna cost me $300.

595
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah.

596
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:46,400
I know you can't get your hands
on $150,

597
00:53:46,466 --> 00:53:48,566
but you better get it on 75.

598
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,133
I can't do that.

599
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:53,600
Arlette, you know, she cleaned me out
when she left.

600
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,533
Well, take another shortie from the bank.
You paid off that last one already.

601
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,466
I had crop money to pay it back with.
Now I don't.

602
00:54:03,266 --> 00:54:04,366
I've got my land...

603
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:06,133
I got my house.

604
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,533
And that's pretty much it.

605
00:54:09,766 --> 00:54:11,466
Well, you'd better find it.

606
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,133
Mortgage this house,
if that's what you have to do.

607
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,366
Seventy-five dollars is yours to share.

608
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,100
Compared to your boy changing didies
at the age of 15,

609
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,633
I think you're getting off cheap.

610
00:54:22,266 --> 00:54:24,733
And if I can't find a way, Harl?

611
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,100
What then?

612
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,700
I'm going.

613
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,433
And I'm not come dunning you for it.

614
00:54:39,633 --> 00:54:42,366
- Mm-hm.
- If you don't... you don't.

615
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,500
But don't say you can't
because I know better.

616
00:54:50,366 --> 00:54:53,166
You should've let her sell that acreage
to Farrington, Wilf.

617
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:55,733
If you'd done that, she'd still be here.

618
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,700
You'd have money in your hand.

619
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:02,200
And my daughter wouldn't be in the...

620
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,700
family way.

621
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,400
They can't send her away like that.

622
00:55:12,466 --> 00:55:14,333
Well, they can and they will.

623
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,133
Now, don't think about doing
nothing stupid or headstrong neither.

624
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:21,366
You'll only make a bad situation worse.

625
00:55:24,066 --> 00:55:25,066
We could run away.

626
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Think about it.

627
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:34,000
I...
If we could get away with what we did...

628
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:37,033
Right?

629
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:44,166
It'd be a shame.

630
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,066
We could get away eloping off to Colorado.

631
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:49,666
You couldn't...

632
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,433
because you've got no money.

633
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,700
Money fixes everything, right?

634
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:59,066
As the wife says
no money spoils everything, boy.

635
00:55:59,133 --> 00:56:00,133
I know that.

636
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,766
Shannon will, too, now that she's got
a baby to watch out for now.

637
00:56:04,033 --> 00:56:06,233
- You'll see.
- Not if they make her give it away.

638
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,300
Now, don't change how a woman feels...
when she got a chap in the belly.

639
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:21,166
You see, a chap makes a woman feel wise...

640
00:56:21,366 --> 00:56:24,433
in ways a man don't understand, son.

641
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,066
Now, I haven't lost any respect for you
just because you gonna have a baby.

642
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:31,100
Or her. You ain't the first.

643
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:32,700
You certainly won't be the last.

644
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,500
But you will not... Hey.

645
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,600
You will not ask
a five-month pregnant girl...

646
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:40,100
to run off with you.

647
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:46,066
You can't tell me what to do.

648
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,166
You couldn't even cut Mama's throat
without making a mess of it.

649
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:55,733
I did...

650
00:56:57,066 --> 00:56:58,600
what I did for us.

651
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:04,633
Now, what good are 180 acres
if I've got no one to pass them on to?

652
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,333
There was another way, Pa.

653
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:14,233
You know there was.

654
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,066
You cursed it all!

655
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:23,633
Boy.

656
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,300
You cursed me!

657
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:27,033
Boy.

658
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:42,200
He went off to school the next day
without any argument.

659
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,500
Probably because I let him take the T.

660
00:57:46,066 --> 00:57:47,400
Once he was gone,

661
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,000
I started searching.

662
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:55,233
I wondered if she had socked
a little something away...

663
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:00,400
just like that story I sold the sheriff.

664
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,600
Each time I found nothing,
I became convinced there was something.

665
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:02,100
Will Hemingford Home and Trust
loan you 35 dollars?

666
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:03,566
You bet.

667
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,466
But... you don't need $35.

668
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:10,766
Oh, I'm sad to say that I do.

669
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:12,100
No, you don't.

670
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:15,066
You need 750. That's what you need.

671
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,266
And you could have it today.
And do you wanna tell me

672
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:21,533
there aren't improvements you could make?
A roof to fix?

673
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,100
A little more livestock?

674
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:27,233
Maybe even indoor plumbing,
like your neighbor down the road?

675
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:32,066
You could end up with improvements
that far outweigh the cost of a mortgage.

676
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:33,366
Value for money, Wilf.

677
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,566
Value for money.

678
00:59:37,066 --> 00:59:39,033
Yeah, this new proposal...

679
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,766
needs a little thinking about.

680
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:47,700
Well, I ought to talk it over
with my boy, Henry.

681
00:59:47,766 --> 00:59:51,233
Or, uh, Hank,
as he likes to be called now.

682
00:59:53,033 --> 00:59:54,033
Yep.

683
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,266
He's getting to an age
where... he needs to be consulted.

684
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:05,500
Well, all I got...
it'll all be his someday.

685
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,760
"Papa, I have taken the truck.

686
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:31,400
I guess you know where I am going.

687
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:33,166
Leave me alone.

688
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,700
I know you can send Sheriff Jones after me
to bring me back,

689
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,633
but if you do I will tell everything.

690
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,066
You might think I'd change my mind
because I am just a kid, but I won't.

691
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:53,500
Without Shan, Pa,
I don't care about nothing.

692
01:01:00,466 --> 01:01:02,433
I love you, Papa,
even if I don't know why

693
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,566
since everything we did
has brought me misery.

694
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:08,666
Your loving son, Henry 'Hank' James."

695
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:45,733
Waiting for a teenage boy
to come to his senses

696
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,233
is like waiting for a broomstick
to sprout flowers.

697
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,533
But what choice did I have?

698
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,666
I had murdered my wife
to keep my home.

699
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:07,233
The only way I was leaving it now
would be in chains.

700
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:35,033
Three days ago, in Lyme Biska,
not far from the rider found your truck...

701
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,100
somebody held up a grocery store
on the edge of town.

702
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,500
Took $23. I got the report on my desk.

703
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,566
Say it was a young fella
wearing old cowboy clothes

704
01:04:44,633 --> 01:04:46,066
with a bandana over his mouth

705
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,400
and a plainsman's hat
slouched over his eyes.

706
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,500
Um, Henry left from school, sheriff...

707
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:01,333
and so far as I remember he...

708
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:07,766
He had on a flannel shirt that day,
had on some corduroy trousers.

709
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,433
I don't... think
he took any clothes with him, and...

710
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:17,600
Anyway, he don't have no cowboy clothes,
if you mean boots and all.

711
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:19,600
He don't have no plainsman's hat neither.

712
01:05:20,566 --> 01:05:24,066
- He could've stolen those, too.
- Now, you don't know anything more

713
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:26,166
than what you said,
and you ought to stop.

714
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:28,366
All right?
Now, I know your friends with Harlan.

715
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:30,700
I know y'all hang at
that Elk's Club or whatever.

716
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:32,200
My son is not a robber.

717
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:35,633
He don't treat women badly,
he don't be mean to people.

718
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,666
He acts like a normal kid.

719
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:40,666
And this is not how he was raised either.

720
01:05:43,433 --> 01:05:45,166
Good day, sheriff.

721
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:51,733
Yeah, it's probably just a drifter
looking for a quick payday.

722
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,633
But I felt that I had to bring it up.

723
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:57,766
And we don't know how people talk, do we?

724
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,200
Talk gets around.

725
01:05:59,766 --> 01:06:00,766
Talk is cheap.

726
01:06:14,466 --> 01:06:19,066
Sometimes work is the only thing
to help drive out bad thoughts.

727
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:26,366
Fixing a leak would only take
a day or two.

728
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,600
I needed work that would keep me
through the winter.

729
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:37,733
The next day I took out that mortgage
for $750.

730
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:43,500
In the end...

731
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,200
we all get caught.

732
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:33,300
Turn, you son of a...

733
01:10:34,366 --> 01:10:37,466
Why are you...?

734
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:40,066
Come on!

735
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:47,266
She whispered secrets to me
only a dead woman could know.

736
01:13:53,766 --> 01:13:54,766
Stay back!

737
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:28,566
Now! Hurry! Close the door!

738
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,700
Back up.

739
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,133
We're gonna get you fixed up, all right?

740
01:15:39,533 --> 01:15:41,366
I'll get some wood.

741
01:15:41,566 --> 01:15:42,666
I'll make it warm.

742
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,100
I'll make it warm.

743
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,066
It's dead... Henry.

744
01:15:58,166 --> 01:15:59,433
No more, please.

745
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:03,433
Just kill me...

746
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,533
please.

747
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:08,033
Please, just kill me.

748
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,533
Just kill me.

749
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,733
Arlette, please, just kill me.

750
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:15,600
Open my throat...

751
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,633
like I opened yours.

752
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,166
Yeah.

753
01:16:26,066 --> 01:16:27,133
Please.

754
01:16:32,366 --> 01:16:37,333
But she wouldn't.
Not till she was satisfied.

755
01:16:59,266 --> 01:17:00,533
Shannon?

756
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,500
Shannon.

757
01:19:44,433 --> 01:19:45,433
Two days ago...

758
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:51,133
a farmer on his way to Lyme Biska
noticed something... in a ditch.

759
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:53,200
Remains of a woman.

760
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,233
A pair of her back teeth were missing.

761
01:20:10,733 --> 01:20:13,133
Was Arlette missing a couple
of back teeth?

762
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
When I, uh...

763
01:20:27,566 --> 01:20:30,433
When I came out that day
just after she ran off...

764
01:20:32,766 --> 01:20:36,300
your boy mentioned
that she took... her good jewelry

765
01:20:36,366 --> 01:20:39,666
and you mentioned something about $200.

766
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:40,733
Isn't that right?

767
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:47,666
Well, there you go.

768
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:51,700
She was robbed on the road.

769
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:53,600
Some bad egg...

770
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,100
picked her up, killed her and...

771
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,466
robbed her of her money and her jewelry.

772
01:21:23,266 --> 01:21:26,733
Henry's body arrived in Hemingford

773
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
by train on the 18th of December.

774
01:21:50,233 --> 01:21:54,433
- Mr. James.
- Tell us what happend.

775
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,300
- Mr. James. Mr. James.
- Mr. James.

776
01:21:56,366 --> 01:21:59,033
- What about your son?
- Describe what you're feeling

777
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,709
now that your son's body
is back in Hemingford.

778
01:22:00,733 --> 01:22:03,700
- Mr. James.
- Just give us something to print.

779
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,133
Mr. James.

780
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:15,366
I'm sorry, Mr. James.

781
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,066
Rats got to them.

782
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,000
Got to both of them
before they were found.

783
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,566
Look what they done...

784
01:22:41,533 --> 01:22:42,633
to my boy.

785
01:22:44,733 --> 01:22:45,733
You...

786
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:49,166
fix him up.

787
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,333
Mr. James, sir...

788
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:56,366
- the damage is...
- Yeah. I can see what the damn damage is.

789
01:22:56,433 --> 01:22:58,233
You fix him up, get him off this...

790
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:01,033
- Sir...
- ...plate here

791
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,700
and put him in a coffin.

792
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,033
A fine coffin.

793
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,133
Your finest coffin.

794
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,733
- Yes, sir.
- I got money.

795
01:23:12,766 --> 01:23:14,166
Certainly, Mr. James.

796
01:23:14,533 --> 01:23:16,000
Now, you cover him up now.

797
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:31,366
My boy.

798
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:38,566
All right.

799
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:46,133
What...

800
01:23:48,466 --> 01:23:49,600
I got money, so...

801
01:23:52,133 --> 01:23:53,166
Whatever it takes.

802
01:23:57,266 --> 01:24:02,000
No father should have to kiss his son
for the last time...

803
01:24:04,266 --> 01:24:07,033
but if any father deserved such a fate...

804
01:24:08,533 --> 01:24:09,533
it was I.

805
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:13,500
"You believe in God,
believe also in me.

806
01:24:14,533 --> 01:24:17,600
Do not let your heart be troubled.

807
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,166
Believe in God...

808
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,300
believe also in me.

809
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:28,166
In my father's house
are many dwelling places.

810
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,266
If it were not so,
I would have told you.

811
01:24:33,566 --> 01:24:34,733
And the way you know..."

812
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:38,033
The attendance was much smaller
for Henry.

813
01:24:38,433 --> 01:24:40,400
"If I go and prepare a place for you

814
01:24:40,466 --> 01:24:43,366
I will come again
and receive you to myself.

815
01:24:45,033 --> 01:24:48,133
That where I am
there you may be also.

816
01:24:48,466 --> 01:24:51,333
And you know the way where I go..."

817
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Um...

818
01:26:43,633 --> 01:26:44,733
Now, just hear me out.

819
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:47,666
Um...

820
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,200
I wanna sell you my 100 acres.

821
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,500
That's good land, Harl.

822
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:02,766
Hard times, huh?

823
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:09,433
Half your house and half your barn
all caved in.

824
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,400
Hermie Gordon says you even got a cow
living in there with you.

825
01:27:22,066 --> 01:27:23,066
Nonetheless...

826
01:27:24,533 --> 01:27:26,000
I wanna give you that land...

827
01:27:27,733 --> 01:27:29,033
for $500.

828
01:27:32,733 --> 01:27:34,700
Arlette's rolling in her grave.

829
01:27:41,266 --> 01:27:42,700
Sallie left me.

830
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:48,633
I don't think she's coming back.

831
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,433
Called me a self-righteous fool
and she's right.

832
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,266
We're in that same broke wagon.

833
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:07,366
Two men who started the year with wives...

834
01:28:09,066 --> 01:28:10,633
ending the year without them.

835
01:28:14,733 --> 01:28:17,266
Two men started the year
with living children...

836
01:28:22,633 --> 01:28:24,366
ended the year with dead ones.

837
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,400
I still got both my hands.

838
01:28:36,033 --> 01:28:37,566
That's something, I suppose.

839
01:28:44,633 --> 01:28:46,133
That land's cursed.

840
01:28:48,433 --> 01:28:49,600
Sell it to the bank.

841
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,600
Well, now...

842
01:28:52,466 --> 01:28:53,466
See, uh...

843
01:28:55,066 --> 01:28:57,300
they'd just turn around
and sell it to Farrington.

844
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,200
Harl...

845
01:29:01,366 --> 01:29:02,500
that stream there...

846
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,433
they'd be filling up with blood...
hog intestines.

847
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,300
That's your stream, too, Harl.

848
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,033
And all I ask is...

849
01:29:15,066 --> 01:29:16,500
they don't get their hands on it.

850
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,500
Not...

851
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,600
Not them.

852
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:25,166
Wilf...

853
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,566
don't come back here ever.

854
01:30:31,366 --> 01:30:33,233
What the hell happened to you, girl?

855
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,466
All right, girl.

856
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:13,466
Take it easy.

857
01:31:16,133 --> 01:31:17,533
All right, easy now.

858
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:19,166
Shh.

859
01:31:22,033 --> 01:31:24,266
It's all right. Easy now.

860
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,666
Shh.

861
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,333
Okay.

862
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,000
Almost over.

863
01:31:34,366 --> 01:31:35,366
Okay, girl.

864
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,266
It's nearly over.

865
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:44,366
Shh.

866
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:46,333
It's okay.

867
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,400
It's okay.

868
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:50,400
Shh.

869
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,533
That was the end of 1922.

870
01:32:32,366 --> 01:32:34,333
I lost the farm, of course.

871
01:32:35,233 --> 01:32:37,300
When the hog-butchers finally swooped in,

872
01:32:37,366 --> 01:32:40,666
I was forced to sell
at an insanely low price.

873
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:57,566
Harlan Cotterie hung on
till about '25 or so...

874
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:02,366
and then the bank took his farm.

875
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,633
I went to Omaha.

876
01:33:08,033 --> 01:33:09,333
A city of fools...

877
01:33:10,633 --> 01:33:13,166
and I hauled pallets for 14 months.

878
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,166
The only reason I stopped?

879
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,733
Whenever I tried to busy myself with work,
to keep out the thoughts...

880
01:33:32,133 --> 01:33:33,333
they'd find me.

881
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:51,066
Took me two solid years
to drink up Arlette's hundred acres.

882
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:01,233
When I wasn't drinking...

883
01:34:06,466 --> 01:34:11,533
I visited the places that Henry had been
during the last month of his life.

884
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:15,433
Can I help you, sir?

885
01:34:16,533 --> 01:34:18,666
There was a robbery here, uh...

886
01:34:20,033 --> 01:34:22,000
oh, about two years back.

887
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,700
You wouldn't happen to know
about nothing like that?

888
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,233
Well, that was my son.

889
01:34:40,266 --> 01:34:41,433
Henry was right.

890
01:34:43,466 --> 01:34:45,300
There was another way.

891
01:34:47,466 --> 01:34:48,733
There always is.

892
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:54,233
But in 1922...

893
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:02,166
the conniving man
inside farmer Wilfred James...

894
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,066
had begged to differ.

895
01:35:17,433 --> 01:35:19,433
But I can't pray now
or ever again.

896
01:35:20,766 --> 01:35:23,633
If I got down on my knees,
I think God would strike me dead.

897
01:35:28,466 --> 01:35:30,033
I hope there is no God.

898
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,033
I imagine all murderers hope there isn't.

899
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,366
Because if there's no heaven,
there's no hell.

900
01:35:41,166 --> 01:35:42,166
Son...

901
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:46,433
...I was the one...

902
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,600
who killed her.

903
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,200
No, Pa.

904
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:57,433
We did it together.

905
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,380
All right, Hank.

906
01:36:05,033 --> 01:36:07,633
I love you... son.

907
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,600
I know.

908
01:36:15,033 --> 01:36:16,400
But I don't much deserve it.

909
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:43,700
Papa...

910
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,666
it'll be quick.

911
01:37:06,566 --> 01:37:07,700
In the end...

912
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,166
we all get caught.
