21
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,658
NAH, I DON'T THINK HOYT
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,597
UH, SAD BUT TRUE,
KIDS ARE KIDNAPPED.

23
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,766
WELL, RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

24
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,302
THEY HAD TO, LIKE, DRAG HIM
INTO COURT AND ALL THAT STUFF--

25
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,638
SO HE'S KIND OF FORCED
TO BE AROUND EVERYBODY
AND ALL THAT STUFF--

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,275
THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE.
AND THERE WAS SOME MEAN
IN HIM THEN, YOU KNOW.

27
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:27,146
I DIDN'T CONSIDER HIM,
UP UNTIL THAT TIME,
A DRUNKARD OR ANYTHING.

28
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,581
I DIDN'T TALK TO HIM AT LENGTH
ABOUT IT, BUT, YOU KNOW,

29
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,818
WE WERE DELIVERING HAY,
AND HE WAS JUST BROKE UP.

30
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,321
YOU KNOW, SHOW IT TO ME
AND THEN I'LL BELIEVE IT.

31
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,558
YOU ASK ME, I THINK HE'S--
HE'S GUILTY.

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,494
MAYBE EVERYBODY'S PROJECTING
THEIR FEAR ON HOYT.

33
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,862
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

34
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,864
THAT'S WHY HE'S LEFT ALONE.

35
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,667
BUT HE'S STAYING THERE
UNTIL HE FINDS HIS BOY.

36
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,574
I MEAN, IT'S SAD.
IT'S SAD AS CAN BE.

YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO.

CODY WAS IN MY
LITTLE GIRL'S CLASS.

41
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,686

OF COURSE, I KNOW CODY, MAN.

46
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,564

BUT IT COULD HAPPEN.

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,897
COULD HAPPEN AROUND HERE IF
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOMEWHERE.

56

THAT'S--I DON'T BELIEVE
ANY OF IT, YOU KNOW.

THIS IS MY FIRST BIG CASE
WITH THEM.

112
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:40,432

I'M SO FAMILIAR WITH THE CATTLE

TELLING YOU ABOUT.

00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,507

NOW, ONE WAS EMPTY
LIKE THE FIRST ONE I FOUND.

00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,945
BUT THE SECOND HAD THIS IN IT.

576
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:57,447
- WHAT IS THIS?
- IT'S A U-MATIC TAPE.

577
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,983
MOSTLY USED IN THE LATE '60S
AND EARLY '70S.

578
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,851
AND, SAM, THAT WOULD CORRESPOND
TO THE TIMEFRAME

579
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,354
THAT MDE SAID THEY WERE
ORIGINALLY ON THE PROPERTY.

580
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,624
I'M NOT SURE OFFHAND
IF WE HAVE ANYTHING ON SITE
I CAN CHECK THIS WITH.

00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:26,943

SAID "FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY."

587
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,546

MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
