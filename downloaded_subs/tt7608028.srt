I wouldn't have reception up here.

Hello?

186
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,724
Oh.

187
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,350
Hi.

188
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,352
Oh, no, no.

189
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,438
Well, you know...

190
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,232

192
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,197

Yeah, I know.

He's okay.

195
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,161
I know.

196
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,247
We're at my sister's house.

197
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,168
It's a big, nice house.

198
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,919

Yeah?

211
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,183
Did you get a chance to sleep today?

212

Not-- not really.

213

Well, you'll sleep like a rock tonight.

First open house is tomorrow,

215
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,820
so we gotta be out of here by 11:00, okay?

216
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,406
Okay.

217
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,076
Honey, are you sure you don't want to keep
that stuff in my room?

218
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,160
No, no, it's okay.

Okay.

220
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,207
Well, I'm gonna head to bed.

Who are you?

228
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,736
What are you doing on our property?

229
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,154
Ma'am?

230
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,531
What do you want?

231
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,868
Ma'am, this is our house.

232
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,370
-Do you need help?
-No!

00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,461
You need to get up right now.
The open house is starting in 15 minutes.

238
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,422
Ed, come on. You gotta get 
the sign-in sheet out of the car.

239
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,175
-You kidding me?
-The open house ends at five.

240
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,010
Ed is gonna be running the show today,

241
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,222
which means he will turn off 
all the lights, he'll lock up.

242
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,183
And Ed, don't forget 
to leave the key under the mat.

243
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,142
Got it.

244
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,103
Oh, okay.

245
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,105
-And do I need to do--
-Oh, God, no, no.

246
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,607
You don't have to do a thing,
except one:

247
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,777
Do not come back here until after five,

248
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:46,031
because we do not want to upset 
any potential buyers.

249
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,409
-Mom, why didn't you wake me up?
-Oh, sorry.

250
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,120
-I got a call and then I didn't--
-They scared the hell out of me.

251
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,580

Welcome.

256
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,451
And if you have any further questions
today, just sign in right there,

257
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,162
and otherwise,
take a cookie, look around,

258
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,788

259
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,556
[Naomi] So, why would she knock?

260
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,391
She's nuts.

261
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,602
Maybe she was lost.

262
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,357
I just don't think the people up here
know what privacy is.

263
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,277
Excuse me? Your card was declined.
Do you have another one we could use?

264
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,529
Oh.

265
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,157
Uh, you know what?

266
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,867
I'll just use cash.

00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,118
Okay.

-What?
-Yeah. Come on, it'll be fun.

Uh, if you won the lottery...

281
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,799
what would you do with the winnings?

282
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,093
I don't wanna play.

283

Fine. Uh...

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,226
I'd...

287
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,812
I'd pay off our debt.

288
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,523
Okay.

We're not that bad off.

290
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,193
But I would let you.

291
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,823
I'd buy us a new house back home.

292
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,201
-Can we have a pool?
-And a track.

293
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,997
I'd go to the Olympics in Japan.

294
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,791
-Can I come with you?
-Yeah. First class.

295
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,753
Other than that, I'd probably 
just give the rest to you.

296
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,297
No.

297
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,382
I don't need it. You...

298
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,762
You'd probably spend it 
on things that matter.

299
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,599
Well, I personally think that...

301
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,939
and owning a home 
with the biggest backyard ever

302
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,650
are things that matter.

303
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:10,944
Thanks.

304
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,655
Okay. My turn.

306
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,870
And then I think I would...

start doing photography again.

308
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,626
-Really?
-Yeah. I think so. I used to love it.

309
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,671
You should...

310
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,007
You should start again now.

-Please.
-You should.

You don't have to win the lottery 
to do that.

722
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:36,479
It's definitely creepy,
but we didn't see anything.

723

Mom...

724
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:43,486
Uh, well, we had an open house here
a few days ago,

725
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,157
so maybe someone found 
a spare key laying around, or...

726
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,117
Or maybe someone stayed.

727
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:56,624
I know it sounds stupid, but other things
have happened before this.

728
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,377
Things moving from one room to another.
Weird phone calls.

729
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,087
From anyone in particular?

730
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,381
No. No one would respond.

731
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,469
Don't look at her. I'm not lying.

732
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,387
Okay, look.

733
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,391
I know that we probably sound
like the crazy new people in town,

734
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:17,312
but this is my sister's house, and we're
supposed to be taking care of it, so--

735
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:20,315
Look, I understand the fear
in these situations.

736
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,524
Okay? I do.

737
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,070
But it's likely the front door was
unlocked and some kids snuck in.

738
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,529
Are you kidding me?

739
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,491
Look at this. 
You think some kids did this?

740
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,327
It's not uncommon. Okay?
Kids get bored. They do weird things.

741
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,371
They were probably trying to scare
the newcomers.

742
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,626
Okay. [clears throat]

743
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:42,045
Is there nothing else you can do?

744
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:47,050
If it makes you feel any better,
we can come by in the morning.

745
