1
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,366
Shit.

2
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,345
Bingo.

3
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,799
Oh, my.

4
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,272
Damn.

5
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,268
Open fire, everybody!

6
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,638
- Come on!
- Take him out! Go!

7
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,504
Incoming!

8
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,882
Hit the deck!

9
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,512
Yes!

10
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,359
Yeah!

11
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,250
I don't think so.

12
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,334
- Good work, Agent Marcus.
- Thank you.

13
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,466
Great shooting, Mahoney.
Now clean up all that shit, huh?

14
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,206
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's it.

15
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,000
ID, please.

16
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,861
All right, sir.

17
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,815
Voorhees, Jason.

18
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,072
This case is eyes only.
Tape is strictly for internal distribution.

19
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,574
Anyone listening must have
C-4 clearance or higher.

20
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,533
If not, you're in a heap of trouble.
Ha-ha-ha.

21
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,436
Mm.

22
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,932
Jesus!

23
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,829
We have a large male Caucasian...

24
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:17,959
with massive tissue loss
due to extreme explosive trauma.

25
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:23,170
Weight, I'd say 230, maybe, unh, 240.

26
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:28,713
And third-degree burns
over 65 percent of the anterior torso.

27
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,506
First and second over...

28
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,143
posterior torso.

29
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,081
In addition to explosive trauma...

30
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,788
the subject is a victim of...

31
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,464
multiple bullet wounds.

32
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,011
At a glance, I'd say
we're looking at well over...

33
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,135
a hundred bullet wounds of...

34
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,015
varying caliber.

35
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,280
This is gonna be a real joy to count.

36
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,297
Yes. Yeah.

37
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,515
In my professional opinion...

38
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,175
this guy's deader than shit.

39
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,479
Uh, strike that last
comment from the record.

40
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:45,770
Evidence upon examination
indicates severe pulmonary edema.

41
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:53,865
I'd say the heart appears
to be twice the size of a normal heart.

42
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,151
It's malformed.

43
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,706
Left, right atria.

44
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:15,547
The heart appears to be filled
with a black, viscous fluid.

45
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,385
Frankly I don't know what the hell It ls.
It's not blood.

46
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,854
- ID.
- You just saw me come out of there.

47
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,114
ID, please.

48
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,542
Oh, one second.

49
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,046
Just-Ha, ha.

50
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,097
Hmm?

51
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,403
You know, Phil, this is actually
kind of an amazing opportunity.

52
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,189
I mean, how many people
actually get a chance...

53
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,030
to say whatever they want
to Jason fucking Voorhees?

54
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,862
Hey, fuck.

55
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:51,368
How you doing, you fat-ass,
maggoty, blown-up fuck?

56
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,296
Suck this. Suck it.

57
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,880
You know what I'd like to do to you?
I'd like to take a crap...

58
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,009
right on your fucking mask.

59
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,345
A big old mango-sized crap.

60
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,887
Yes, that's a probe.

61
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,141
Phil!

62
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,645
Doc, what's the verdict?

63
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,086
Jason gonna be getting up
and walking around anytime soon?

64
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,464
Heh. Yeah, we really nailed that fucker.

65
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,256
He weren't nothing
but a big old pussy, anyway.

66
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,642
<i>Dead or deadly?</i>

67
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,021
<i>These traumatic photos were taken in the
aftermath of the autopsy of Jason Voorhees.</i>

68
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,855
<i>Two security men, dead.</i>

69
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,065
<i>A coroner. Dead.</i>

70
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,072
<i>Another coroner missing.</i>

71
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,532
<i>Are these men victims of a serial killer
only believed to be deceased?</i>

72
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,912
<i>Many say yes.</i>

73
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,665
<i>Hi, I'm Robert Campbell.</i>

74
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,578
<i>For over 20 years, the mere mention
of the name Jason Voorhees...</i>

75
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,624
<i>has been enough to send a shudder of fear
through the hearts of an entire nation.</i>

76
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,885
<i>Born in 1946
to Elias and Pamela Voorhees...</i>

77
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,887
<i>Jason was believed to have drowned
in Camp Crystal</i> Lake...

78
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,798
at the tender age of 11-

79
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,184
<i>Sadly, he did not.</i>

80
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,937
<i>Since then he has been responsible
for 83 confirmed murders...</i>

81
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,315
<i>and speculated scores of others.</i>

82
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,603
<i>Tonight on a very special episode
of American Case File...</i>

83
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,864
<i>we'll show you an interview conducted
with Mr. Creighton Duke...</i>

84
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,571
<i>just one week after
Jason's alleged termination.</i>

85
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,078
<i>You'll remember, Mr. Duke is the bounty
hunter previously responsible...</i>

86
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,832
<i>for the capture of six of this country's
most reviled serial killers.</i>

87
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,664
<i>Let's go to the tape.</i>

88
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,538
<i>For the first time,
our cameras were allowed a glimpse...</i>

89
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,834
<i>of the private training compound
of bounty hunter Creighton Duke.</i>

90
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,881
<i>Duke invited us with the promise of
a very unusual, very expensive proposition.</i>

91
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,346
<i>And I think you'll agree,
in typical Creighton Duke fashion...</i>

92
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,682
<i>he gave us much more
than we bargained for.</i>

93
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,809
<i>Just watch.</i>

94
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,992
I'm gonna say two words to you.

95
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,610
I want you to say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

96
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,270
- Okay.
- You ready?

97
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,531
- Shoot.
- Jason Voorhees.

98
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,198
Well, that makes me think of...

99
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,706
a little gin in a pink dress
sticking a hot dog through a doughnut.

100
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,747
Well, I was actually referring to your claim
that Jason Voorhees rs not truly dead.

101
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,210
What you think of as Jason is not Jason.

102
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,471
That body he's wearing, that's just meat.

103
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,224
That boy knows how to dress.

104
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,477
He wears other people's bodies
like folks wear a suit.

105
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,890
He may get blown up, but that's a
little minor inconvenience for him.

106
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,525
He'll just get himself another body.

107
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,855
Jason Voorhees,
the true Jason Voorhees...

108
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,696
is something you and I
have never seen before, Mr. Campbell.

109
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,697
There's only one way
to put an end to him for all time.

110
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,949
And I'm the only one that knows the way.

111
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:24,456
So if you want him dead, truly dead...

112
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,671
500 grand is my fee.

113
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:32,093
And for that you get the mask,
the machete, the whole damn thing.

114
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,179
<i>Quite a character.</i>

115
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,141
<i>In the week following
our interview with Creighton Duke...</i>

116
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,897
<i>there have been five more
Jason-style murders.</i>

117
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,400
<i>All, perhaps not surprisingly...</i>

118
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,607
<i>on a direct path from the Federal Morgue
in Youngstown, Ohio...</i>

119
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,616
<i>where Jason's remains were flown
to Crystal Lake.</i>

120
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,782
<i>Tonight, in the interest
of public safety...</i>

121
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:59,290
<i>I am prepared to offer Creighton Duke
his sum of $500, 000.</i>

122
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,749
Payable only after he provides American
Case File and the American people...

123
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,131
<i>with incontrovertible proof
of Jason's existence...</i>

124
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,214
<i>and then puts an end
to him for all time.</i>

125
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,631
<i>We'll be back with American Case File
in</i> a <i>moment.</i>

126
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,647
- This is truly sick.
- Tell me about it.

127
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,487
No, this is not sick. Diana.
This is business.

128
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,199
People will come to see Jason's hometown,
and they'll come with appetites.

129
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,365
- Shake a leg, Di, food's up.
- Thanks, Shel..

130
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:44,001
Hey, Ma, do you really want me
to out these like this?

131
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,128
- Yes, I do.
- They look stupid.

132
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:50,508
It's your own dumb-assed fault.
They're supposed to look like hockey masks.

133
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,594
Now watch.

134
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,893
This makes a whole new patty.
Hence, the two-for-one burger sale.

135
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,351
God, I love this woman. Hold me back.

136
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,060
You guys make me sick.

137
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,195
What can I get you?

138
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,954
I'll take a Voorhees burger
and a side of Jason fingers.

139
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,991
- Okay, anything else?
- Yes.

140
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,953
Creighton Duke.

141
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,249
- I know who you are.
- I'm gonna kill Jason Voorhees.

142
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,883
I need you to help me.

143
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,544
Jason Voorhees is dead.

144
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,840
You know he's not. I know he's not.

145
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,474
And he's coming for you.

146
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,391
- Your food will be right out.
- Name your price.

147
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,065
Everyone has a price. What's yours?

148
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,148
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

149
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,028
And you know why I need you.

150
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,075
- Well, I think you need to leave.
- I know everything about you, Diana.

151
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,032
I know who you really are.

152
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,787
What's the problem here?

153
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,450
Oh, I was just making your girlfriend there
a little proposition, chief...

154
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,539
and she's thinking it over.

155
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,374
Right, love?

156
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,164
Come on. Get up.

157
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,670
Why don't you blow me, chief? Hmm?

158
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,052
Rig ht after your girlfriend there
gets through.

159
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,636
That's my lady you're talking about.

160
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,930
Welt, now, see, she is only your lady because
she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.

161
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,942
- Well, damn it!
- Careful, careful, chief.

162
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,273
I don't think you really know who I am.

163
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,437
I know who you are.

164
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,654
The last thing we need around here is
some freako bounty hunter causing trouble.

165
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,491
I want you out of this town
and I want you out now.

166
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:46,123
- Now, that is very colorful, chief.
- Randy!

167
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,831
Take him out to my car.
I'll be out in a minute.

168
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,837
All right, let's go.

169
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,128
He's coming for you, Diana.
And your daughter.

170
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,339
- Lock your doors.
Uh-uh.

171
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,305
I'm sorry if he upset you.

172
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,181
I don't need you to fight my battles.

173
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,934
I don't need any part-time protection.

174
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,101
You Okay?

175
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,607
- Yeah.
- Okay.

176
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,861
Seems to think Jason's, uh. Coming for you.

177
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,398
Steven, I need to talk to you.

178
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:23,327
There's something you don't know about
Jessica, something that you should know.

179
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,581
She was gonna tell you herself,
but, uh, there may not be enough time.

180
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,961
If you still care about her, it you still wanna
make things right between the two of you.

181
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,666
then we should talk.

182
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,581
Okay, let's talk.

183
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,546
Yeah, but not here.

184
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,003
Come to my house tonight at 11.

185
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,547
And don't be late.

186
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,261
- Right.
- Great.

187
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,133
Hi. Thank you so much.
We have been there for an hour.

188
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,301
- Sure.
- Thanks a lot, man.

189
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,814
Sure. So where we heading?

190
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,567
- We're going to Camp Crystal Lake.
- Oh, yeah?

191
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,398
Planning on smoking a little dope...

192
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,406
having a little premarital sex
and getting slaughtered?

193
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,573
A joke. It's just a joke. It's called
a Crystal Lake levity, you know.

194
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,753
- So, uh, why are you going to the camp?
- Well, now that Jason's dead-

195
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,586
We're thinking about smoking some dope,
having a little premarital sex...

196
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,171
and, uh, not worry
about getting slaughtered.

197
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,681
Here's where the camp was. They
tore the cabins down a few years ago...

198
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,971
- but this is the place.
- Excellent.

199
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,773
Hey, thanks a lot.

200
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,612
Come with us.

201
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,868
We're thinking of going
skinny-dipping later.

202
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,411
God, I'd love to...

203
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,951
but, uh, I gotta meet someone tater.

204
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,046
Your girlfriend?

205
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,295
Go on. Have fun.

206
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,473
You don't know what you're missing.

207
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,643
Here she is.

208
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,160
Let's do it.

209
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,297
Oh, my God, that water.

210
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,865
Come here.

211
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,917
Um, do you mind if we use the tent
for half an hour?

212
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,626
No. Actually, take it for the whole night.
I'm gonna sleep out here.

213
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,132
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you know, it's a beautiful night.

214
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,545
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Go. Go. Go.

215
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,260
Go, go, go.

216
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,350
Damn.

217
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,755
Come on, let's do it.

218
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,467
Think you're ready
for Tony the Wonder Llama?

219
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,719
You got a rubber?

220
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,343
In my pack outside.

221
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,097
- I'll get them.
- No, no, no.

222
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,264
Forget it. Forget about it.

223
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,435
I gotta pee anyway.

224
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,363
I gotta go out there anyway.
I'll be right back.

225
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,276
Hurry HP-

226
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,869
I found it.

227
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,959
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

228
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,128
That's nice.

229
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,632
Oh, God, Debbie, I hate these things.

230
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,300
Debbie! Help!

231
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,207
Tango? Tango?

232
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,219
Oh, there you are. Well, come here.

233
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,223
There. Yeah.

234
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,261
Hello, sweetheart.
Yeah, there you are. Yeah.

235
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,874
- Aah!
- Di, it's me, Josh.

236
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,136
I was just going to my car.
I didn't mean to scare you.

237
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,513
- Here.
- It's all right.

238
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,470
- Oh, thanks.
- Here.

239
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,848
Look, hon...

240
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,350
don't worry about Ed.

241
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,268
He'll come around. He's too smart a guy
to let you get away, you know?

242
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,562
Yeah, well, I guess I'm just a little,
uh, too old for going steady.

243
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,605
Yeah, well, so is he and he knows it.

244
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:47,117
Trust me, it'll work out.

245
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,904
- Thanks.
- Good night.

246
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,782
Good night, Josh.

247
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,965
- Hello, baby.
- Hi.

248
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,797
Oh, not here, not here.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

249
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,962
What's the big deal?
Rays bowling go late?

250
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,974
The League changed the damned time.
We've only got till 10:30.

251
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,973
- Get in.
- Ha, ha.

252
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,807
Fuck!

253
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,889
What the fuck are you doing?

254
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,804
You fuck!

255
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,167
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

256
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,578
- Hi.
- Guess what.

257
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,246
<i>- What?</i>
- I have a new boyfriend.

258
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,631
- You'll never guess who.
- Well, what's his name?

259
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,418
- I want it to be a surprise.
- Someone I know?

260
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:14,681
No, but you'll recognize him.
We're gonna come for a visit next weekend.

261
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,558
- Tell her I want to meet her.
- He really wants to meet you.

262
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,561
- Can you hold on just a second? Okay.
- Suns.

263
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,700
Hi.

264
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,580
- How's the baby?
- Great. Have you seen her father lately?

265
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,912
<i>Steven's coming.</i>

266
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,794
- He's <i>still</i> asking <i>about you.</i>
- I don't wanna talk to him.

267
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,756
<i>I don't wanna see him when I'm home.
He can see the baby if he wants.</i>

268
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,714
- Can you tell him?
<i>- I'll tell</i> him.

269
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,219
I love you, Morn.

270
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,301
I love you too, baby.

271
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,717
Um... Aah!

272
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,094
Mom?

273
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,644
Josh, what are you doing? Josh!

274
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,147
Oh, Jesus.

275
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,487
No! No!

276
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,614
You motherfucker!

277
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,838
Yes, hi. Ls Sheriff Landis there?

278
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,676
Uh, this is Jessica Kimble.
Could you please patch me through?

279
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,954
No! No!

280
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,707
Diana?

281
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,206
Oh, shit!

282
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,481
Jesus.

283
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,999
You saw him?

284
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,417
You know who he is?

285
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,255
You have to save Jessica.

286
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,750
Save Jessica...

287
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,090
- ...and the...
- The what?

288
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:45,976
Save Jessica and...

289
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,845
Diana?

290
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,320
It was Josh. He's still outsi-

291
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,695
Where the hell is he?

292
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:05,408
Oh, my dear God.

293
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,493
He was dead. He had to be dead.

294
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,837
You can't think that I...

295
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:31,270
I don't believe that you murdered Diana, no.
I don't know what happened.

296
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,727
And I know you couldn't have done it.

297
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,066
You just sit tight, okay?

298
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,903
I'm gonna take care of this.
I will straighten everything out.

299
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,319
Randy, what am I gonna do?

300
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,206
What's Jessica gonna do?

301
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,643
<i>Jessica.</i>

302
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,235
I'm so sorry. I wanted to have this
cleaned up before you got here.

303
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,820
That's all right. I was just...

304
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,117
Oh, God, Vicki.

305
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,918
Oh, my gosh.

306
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,549
Who's this?

307
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,554
A girl?

308
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,395
She's beautiful.

309
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,101
Is she yours?

310
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,103
Her name's Stephanie.

311
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,773
She has Steven's eyes.

312
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,239
Why didn't you tell me?

313
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,745
I was going to.

314
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,452
I was gonna tell everybody.
I just didn't...

315
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,413
I didn't expect to be back here so soon.

316
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,040
Is Steven around?

317
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:32,972
Yeah. Listen, here's something I need
to tell you about Steven.

318
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,307
Hopefully we won't have to hold you
for more than a day.

319
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,068
I am gonna bust my <i>ass</i>
to prove that you are innocent.

320
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,320
But you're gonna have
to stay cool, Steven...

321
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,234
because otherwise,
Landis is really gonna kill you, okay?

322
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,291
Come on.

323
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,003
The sheriff's right this way.

324
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:19,146
All right, I'll be back later.
Don't do anything stupid.

325
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,184
What am I gonna do?
I'm locked in a fricking cell.

326
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:26,320
I'm gonna get you out of this, okay?
But you just gotta hang tight.

327
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,573
<i>Okay.</i>

328
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,956
Oh, wait.
Uh, everything you need is in this bag.

329
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,541
Yeah. Here you go.

330
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,627
White bottle, 12:00, green bottle, 1, 1:30.

331
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,589
And work our way up to hard liquor
at dinner time.

332
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,389
What time would you like
me to pick her up?

333
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,100
- Um, come by the diner around 8.
- Okay.

334
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,431
- Okay.
- Bye, sweetheart.

335
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,186
Don't you give Vicki a hard time.

336
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,643
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks, Vicki.

337
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,148
- Hey, you lake good care of her.
- Of course.

338
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,063
Jessie, I got a few papers here.

339
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,359
- Gotta get your signature on them.
- All right.

340
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,870
You're about the saddest-looking
sack of shit I've ever seen.

341
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,080
Why don't you just shut up?

342
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,462
Accused of murder.

343
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:30,252
And not just any murder, but the murder
of the mother of the girl you love. Heh.

344
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,422
- I didn't do it.
- Oh, I know that.

345
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:38,685
Problem is, how are you gonna get
anyone else to believe you?

346
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,766
It was Jason that killed Diana.

347
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,435
What did you say?

348
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,651
There's only one way
to put an end to that devil...

349
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,442
and they don't know the way.

350
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,073
And you do?

351
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:06,459
- Tell me.
- Information like that is very expensive.

352
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:07,918
What's your price?

353
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,459
I think you're too much of a coward
to afford it.

354
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,671
Try me.

355
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,901
Give me your hand.

356
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,947
- What?
- Your hand.

357
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,652
Give it to me.

358
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:50,299
See, everything and everyone has a price.

359
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,169
And the cost of this is very, very high.

360
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,513
Are you ready to pay?

361
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,805
What's the price?

362
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,516
Are you ready to pay?

363
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,686
Yes.

364
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,858
Oh, fuck!

365
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,997
The only way in kill Jason Voorhees
is to destroy his heart.

366
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,713
And there's only one person
who can do that now that Diana's dead.

367
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,502
Her daughter.

368
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,717
- Jessica?
- And he will try to get to her...

369
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,177
- ...before she can get to him.
- What does he want?

370
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,809
- Same thing he wanted her mother for.
- What?

371
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,897
You want information?

372
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,400
You gotta pay.

373
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,859
Come on.

374
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,319
Your hand.

375
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,536
- Are you ready to pay?
- Yes.

376
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,076
Are you sure?

377
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,869
Yes.

378
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,423
Oh, jeez!

379
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:23,217
Those FBI idiots destroyed Jason's body,
so now he needs a new one.

380
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,181
The ones he's jumping in and out of,
they can't last.

381
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,813
They get diseased, he gets weak.

382
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,441
Jason needs to be reborn again
and he needs Jessica to do it.

383
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,943
Why Jessica?

384
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,448
Now, see, that is a very,
very expensive question, boy.

385
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:45,080
And I don't think you've got what it takes
to pay the price.

386
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,951
Tell me.

387
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,151
This one's on the house.

388
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:24,077
In a Voorhees was he born.
Through a Voorhees may he be reborn.

389
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:27,409
And only by the hands of a Voorhees
will he die.

390
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:33,120
Jason had a sister,
your girlfriend's mother, Diana.

391
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:38,629
Now that she's dead, he has only two
blood relatives left in the world...

392
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:43,547
with the power to kill him
or make him reborn.

393
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,972
Jessica and her baby.

394
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,305
I've gotta get out of here,
gotta protect them.

395
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:54,975
The only way to do that is to kill Jason,
and you can't, but Jessica can.

396
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,395
Tell Jessica about her birthright.
Make her believe you.

397
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,939
Go to the Voorhees' house. Find proof.

398
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,109
Because if you don't, Jason will kill her.

399
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,610
And your baby.

400
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,619
Randy! Randy!

401
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,917
Oh, God.

402
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,000
- What is going on here?
- That son of a bitch broke my fingers.

403
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,292
Jesus! Shit!
Let me take a look, okay?

404
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:24,053
Here. Come here. Oh, shit.

405
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,508
Shit!

406
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,551
Quiet.

407
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,305
You asshole.
Okay.

408
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:39,444
Carefully, carefully, open the cell.

409
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,570
You wouldn't kill me.

410
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,111
You might be right.

411
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,575
Okay. Okay, Steven.

412
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,343
Steven, listen to me, please.

413
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:08,473
Don't do this.
You escape and they'll shoot you on sight.

414
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,764
That's a chance I'm gonna have to take.

415
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,768
So I lose a bundle today.

416
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,812
So screw it.

417
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,323
I love that lime lady.

418
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:29,156
Don't pretend to be so noble. You should've
closed up until after the funeral.

419
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,538
- Oh, sure. Two days off with pay, right?
- Hey, hey, baby, not now.

420
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:37,202
Believe it or not, I'm hurt too, and not
just financially. What the fuck is that?

421
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,541
- It's Jessica's baby.
- Get it the fuck out.

422
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,673
- This is a restaurant, not a fucking nursery.
- Hey.

423
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,927
I believe that's the sweetest thing
God ever put on this earth.

424
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,010
- You're a little cutie pie.
- It'll be just as cute on the street.

425
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,264
- Now get it out!
- Hey.

426
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,770
Yeah? Yeah.

427
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,889
No shit?

428
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:07,274
Yeah, if I see him, I'll call. Okay.

430
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,737
- What was that all about?
- Hey, the baby can stay.

431
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,323
Now go to the storeroom
and make a crib out of a box.

432
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,864
- Okay; Go! Go! Go-
- Okay..

433
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,286
Steven Freeman escaped. He's got a gun.

434
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,671
Oh, Jesus.
They know where he was headed?

435
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,755
Knowing Freeman,
he turned ass and he bolted to Canada.

436
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,919
But just in case he didn't...

437
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,173
Hey, babe. Hey, hey, hold on.
Let me do it.

438
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,185
Oh.

439
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,726
<i>Jesus, Pookie.</i>

440
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,779
Okay, we got your bear.

441
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,158
I know this isn't a palace,
but it will have to do.

442
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,821
God, so much like your daddy.

443
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,324
Okay, put you <i>m</i> here.

444
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,916
I'll come back and check on you,
make sure you're okay. Okay?

445
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,353
Jesus.

446
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,311
I don't even know your name.

447
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,105
Steven.

448
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,951
This is my baby.

449
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:40,079
It's the first time
I've ever been able to touch my baby.

450
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,501
Take my car. Get out.

451
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,837
- Ward, I...
- Get out.

452
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,795
Thank you.

453
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,157
Christ.

454
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,524
Oh, my!

455
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,447
What the hell?

456
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:52,964
No.

457
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,055
Yeah.

458
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,842
Hey, Reggie, what's happening?

459
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,180
Oh, yeah, I'm there now.

460
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,722
Oh, it's great. It's disgusting.
Look, I am gonna wanna dress it up.

461
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,017
Maybe we can put a few body parts
in the refrigerator?

462
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,895
Well, Reg, I don't know.
Talk to Harry in Props.

463
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,688
You know what we're going for here.

464
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,825
Twisted Secrets
of the Voorhees House Revealed.

465
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,361
Oh, and also one more thing.

466
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,699
Guess what tomorrow's headline
is gonna read.

467
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:13,254
"Body of Slain Voorhees Woman
Stolen From Morgue."

468
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:18,380
Well, uh, last night, I stole Diana's body
and I hid it here in the closet.

469
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:22,422
And then I went home
and fucked her daughter. Ha-ha-ha.

470
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,598
Reg.

471
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,594
Reg, you wanna calm down?

472
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,230
Listen, I'll talk Jessica
into letting us shoot here, right?

473
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,233
I'll bring the police,
they'll discover the body on camera...

474
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,145
and our ratings
will go right through the fucking roof.

475
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,939
How does that grab you?

476
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,192
Jesus!

477
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,672
Robert?

478
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,224
Hello?

479
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,513
Oh, God.

480
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,516
You scared the hell out of me.
Where have you been?

481
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,980
Robert! Robert!

482
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,862
Get away from her.

483
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,781
What are you-7
Where are you taking me?

484
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,738
- Come on!
- What? Let me go! Oh, <i>my</i> God!

485
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,698
Steven, put me down.

486
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,455
I don't want to go. I am gonna kill you.

487
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,833
You put me down this second.
I'm gonna kill you.

488
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,669
- Get in the car. Get in the car.
- Steven. What-?

489
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,957
What is wrong? What is going on?
Will somebody tell me?

490
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,215
Shut up!

491
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,344
No!

492
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,173
Shit.

493
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,308
Oh, my God!

494
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,183
Steven!

495
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,990
God, Steven!

496
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,413
Stop the car! Pull this car over!

497
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,924
Steven, I mean it! Stop this car!

498
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,963
- Are you out of your mind...?
- Calm down. Shut up!

499
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,847
Please, just listen.

500
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,385
All right. Now, you think I killed Robert
back there, right?

501
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,804
No way he could've lived?
I ran the fucker over?

502
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,223
- Steven-
- Just tell me, did I kill him or not?

503
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,357
- Yes, you killed him.
- Wrong.

504
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,735
He is not dead and that is not Robert.

505
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,072
Jess, I did not kill your mother.

506
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:18,236
Yesterday, Josh, or someone
that looked like Josh, killed her.

507
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,366
After she blew off the back of his head.

508
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,998
I stabbed him with a poker right
through the heart, and he still lived.

509
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,409
- Let me go.
- Look, Jess...

510
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,579
you and the baby are in a lot of danger.
I can help.

511
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,914
I won't leave you this time.

512
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,925
- Yeah, you will, Steven.
- I promise I won't.

513
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,557
Jess, let's go get the baby.

514
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:46,313
You killed my mother!
You think I'd let you near my baby?

515
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:50,893
Out! Out! Get out! Get away from me!

516
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,982
Come on!

517
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,063
- Jess, please!
- Get away from me!

518
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,949
- Get away!
- Jess! Jess!

519
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,112
Damn it. No! No.

520
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,789
Ed! Ed! I just left Steven out on Lake Road.
He killed Robert.

521
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,049
- Hey, slow down.
- No! He ran him over.

522
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,005
- You all right?
- I was at my mothers.

523
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,010
- Did he hurt you?
- Not me. Robert!

524
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:21,298
Okay, you said Steven's out on Lake Road.
Where on Lake Road?

525
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,681
I don't know.

526
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,264
- Oh, past the Meyers' place.
- Okay, we'll get him.

527
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,600
You're safe now. Don't worry.

528
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:31,767
Notify all the units on the Lake Road.
I want this kid.

529
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,657
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

530
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,955
Oh, Randy.

531
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,296
Son of a bitch!

532
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,545
Fuck this.

533
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,220
Randy, you okay?

534
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,681
What the fuck?

535
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,116
God.

536
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,118
Damn!

537
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,530
Get in the fucking car, Steven.

538
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,573
You get in the car.

539
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,834
You want me to cuff you?

540
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,207
What makes you think you can?

541
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,713
I got a gun.

542
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,467
Fuck that. I got a gun.

543
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,717
You totally wrecked Jessica.

544
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,721
Jessica. You've seen Jessica?
Yes, I have seen Jessica.

545
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,180
Where is she?

546
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:50,224
At the station.

547
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,558
Cuff me.

548
01:04:56,726 --> 01:05:00,071
Randy just picked Steven up.
He's bringing him in.

549
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,824
Follow Officer Ryan.
She'll give you some clothes.

550
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,236
- All we have are cop uniforms.
- Anything's fine.

551
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,531
One second.

552
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,292
You all right, mister? Wait a second.
What the--

553
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,341
You find her and you find her quick.

554
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,927
Yeah. Well, I will hear from you.

555
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,230
Stop!

556
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,683
Stop right there!

557
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,739
Steven, help me!

558
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,866
Jessica!

559
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:57,958
Move!

560
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,306
What in the hell was that?

561
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:23,276
Officer down! He's breathing.

562
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,736
Let's check this guy at
the end of the hall.

563
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:30,161
Fuck! Christ.

564
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,581
Get the ambulance.

565
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,918
What's it...?

566
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,715
Oh, my God.

567
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:45,006
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Fuck!

568
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,322
- Vick, where's the baby?
- She's fine.

569
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,736
- Where's the baby?
- In back.

570
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:13,496
- What's wrong?
- Hold it right there.

571
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,283
- Don't move a muscle, either of you.
- Joey, I just want-

572
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,578
Shut up! You're with him.
Nobody's gonna touch that ray of sunshine.

573
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:24,045
- Pookie, call the station.
- I'm doing it, baby. I'm doing it.

574
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:28,178
Holy shit. Line's dead.

575
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:32,177
Son of a bitch. Ward, go see
what the hell's going on at the station.

576
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,435
- Don't let him go over there. He'll get killed.
- Shut up! Go on.

577
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,561
- Ma, he just...
- Ward!

578
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,348
Little mister, just in case.

579
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,610
- Honey, watch the willy.
- Ma.

580
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:52,118
- Ward, don't, please.
- Shut up! Keep your hands up. High.

581
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:08,008
Joey, please.
Just let me get the baby and we'll go.

582
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,510
Shut up. You're with a felon.

583
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,548
- Oh, hey, now, babe, watch the language.
- Fuck you!

584
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,105
- Now look what you've fucking clone!
- Give me the baby, Joey!

585
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,016
Fuck you!

586
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:24,730
Sorry.

587
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,737
Stop. I mean it.

588
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:07,565
Go, go, go!

589
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,255
- Come on.
- She's gone.

590
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,778
- Where is she?
- Vicki must have moved her.

591
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:19,072
In here. Come on.

592
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,911
Pookie!

593
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,298
Don't let him through.

594
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,171
Stop!

595
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:37,174
Oh, shit!

596
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,853
Get away from him,
you fucking piece of shit!

597
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,605
She's gotta be in here.

598
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:54,945
Jess!

599
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,241
No!

600
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,141
Go to hell!

601
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:41,113
Oh, God, Vick. Vick?

602
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,579
I'm gonna try and get some help.

603
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,554
Shit.

604
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,024
Jessica!

605
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,185
Jessica, wait!

606
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,104
Fuck! Damn.

607
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:34,379
<i>I have your baby.
Come to the Voorhees' house alone.</i>

608
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,607
Christ.

609
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,123
You're alone.

610
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,993
Good girl.

611
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,754
Jason could have jumped into
anyone by now but you.

612
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,509
We haven't been formally introduced.

613
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,253
My name is Creighton Duke.

614
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:24,720
What the hell do you think you're doing,
grabbing my baby and bringing her here?

615
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:25,929
Hold it.

616
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,896
Duke, Robert is dead.

617
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,728
I know about your bounty...

618
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:37,111
but you're never gonna see
any of that money now. It's over.

619
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,614
Just give me the baby.

620
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,202
Just give me two minutes.

621
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,214
It's not about the money anymore.

622
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:18,194
- What do you want from me?
- Tonight we can get that bastard.

623
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,732
Tonight we can send Jason Voorhees
straight to hell for all time.

624
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:26,403
- You don't need me for that.
- Yes, I do.

625
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,916
Only through a Voorhees can he be reborn.

626
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,673
And only a Voorhees can kill him.
With that.

627
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,426
No, I won't put my baby in any more danger.

628
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:46,306
You will always be in danger
until Jason is dead.

629
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:51,603
He won't stop coming for you
until he gets you, until he's reborn.

630
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:55,603
Then he will kill you and your baby.

631
01:13:56,724 --> 01:14:01,821
If you want this to be over,
if you want your baby out of danger...

632
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:05,275
then you will end it now
before more people have to die...

633
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,864
like your friends, like your mother.

634
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,447
Because until you kill him...

635
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,959
it will never be over.

636
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,170
Oh, are we sleepy?

637
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,291
Yes, we are.

638
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,677
That could be Steven.

639
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,510
Jason will have jumped
into a new body by now.

640
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,925
You can't trust anyone.

641
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,970
- It couldn't be Steven.
- Anyone. Do you understand?

642
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,059
Duke! Unh!

643
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,768
- Jessica?
- Ed?

644
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,028
- Aah!
- Oh, no!

645
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,609
Kill him! Do it!

646
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,445
Ed, is it really you?

647
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,859
- Of course.
- Stay there.

648
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,370
- Give me the knife.
- I thought you were dead.

649
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,451
- You were wrong.
- Don't come any closer.

650
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,365
- Kill him!
- I can't!

651
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:40,287
Freeze! Get the heH away from her, Ed.

652
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,377
- What should I do?
- Kill the both of them!

653
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,217
- No!
- Do it, or die!

654
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,723
Jessica, give me the knife.

655
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,304
- Stay back!
- Jessica!

656
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,526
Shit!

657
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,543
Get off! Get away from her!

658
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,251
Steven!

659
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,694
Where is it?
I don't know.

660
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,248
Duke?

661
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,175
Come on, I'll help you.

662
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,757
- Give me your hand.
- Come on!

663
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,593
I'm coming.

664
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,104
- Here.
- Damn it.

665
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,935
Hurry!

666
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,819
Where's the dagger?
Under the dresser.

667
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,158
Well, get it!

668
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,833
I don't think so. Oh, God.

669
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,585
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

670
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,246
That part about being reborn
through a Voorhees woman.

671
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,290
- Does it have to be a living woman?
- No.

672
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,756
Duke, that thing's in the basement
with Jessica's mother.

673
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,507
Holy Mother of God.

674
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:09,477
Quick, the dagger. Help her!

675
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,695
Get the damn dagger!

676
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,606
- Lift it up, lift it up.
- I'm trying.

677
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,275
God, I can't. Jessica!

678
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:21,330
You son of a bitch. You remember me?

679
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:29,959
Get the dagger!

680
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,927
Duke!

681
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,304
Tonight, my friend, you will...

682
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,056
God, Jessica!

683
01:18:39,057 --> 01:18:40,637
Die!

684
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,561
Duke!

685
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,394
Oh, God!

686
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,245
- Get away from them, motherfucker!
- No!

687
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:22,759
No.

688
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,486
Oh, no.

689
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:45,325
Go to hell!

690
