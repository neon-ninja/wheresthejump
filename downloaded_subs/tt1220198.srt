2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,716
I am actress Milla Jovovich,

3
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,086
and I will be portraying Dr. Abigail Tyler
in The Fourth Kind.

4
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,522
This film is a dramatization

5
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,992
of events that occurred October 1st
through the 9th of 2000,

6
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,620
in the northern
Alaskan town of Nome.

7
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,721
To better explain
the events of the story,

8
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,357
the director has
included actual

9
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,924
archived footage
throughout the film.

10
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,403
This footage was acquired
from Nome psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler,

11
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,068
who has personally documented over 65 hours
of video and audio materials

12
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,269
during the time
of the incidents.

13
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,209
To better
protect their privacy,

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,111
we have changed
the names and professions

15
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,479
of many of
the people involved.

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,018
Every dramatized scene
in this movie is supported

17
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,145
by either
archived audio, video,

18
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,212
or as it was related
by Dr. Tyler

19
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,281
during extensive interviews
with the director.

20
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,020
In the end, what you believe
is yours to decide.

21
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,393
Please be advised
that some of what

22
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,331
you are about to see
is extremely disturbing.

23
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:45,232
Just relax,
and I'll ask you questions,

24
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,863
and whenever, whatever you want
to toss in there.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,430
Okay.
You all right?

26
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,600
Okay.

27
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,267
I'm going to try

28
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:56,077
and make this as painless
as possible.

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,382
Can you state your
name for the camera?

30
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,010
Dr. Abigail Emily Tyler.

31
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,948
Okay, where would
you like to begin?

32
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,357
I guess...

33
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,724
After what happened with Will,
my husband, I...

34
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:20,099
I went to my friend,
who is also a psychologist, Dr...

35
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:25,872
because I was having trouble
dealing with how he...

36
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,905
With how it happened
and who did it.

37
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,884
You don't think
you might need more time?

38
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:39,585
No, this is something... I have to do this.

39
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,819
I have to remember
his face.

40
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,764
I need it for myself to heal.

41
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,867
I have to try, and I have to know that,
for my children,

42
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,532
that I did everything
that I could

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,370
to remember.
...to remember.

44
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,142
You know, since that night,
Ashley still can't see,

45
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,111
and I don't think that she's gonna
get her sight back

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,747
if she doesn't accept
what happened.

47
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,591
Well, I think you both have the same problem,
just different symptoms.

48
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,494
Yeah, and I think
that it could help

49
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,333
if I could just remember
the face of that man,

50
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:31,269
so we could somehow track him down
and set the record straight

51
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,244
and find some closure.

52
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,347
All right. All right.

53
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,582
Do you want it
on video?

54
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,884
Yeah.

55
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:50,055
Counseling a fellow
psychologist is like...

56
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,460
It's like talking to myself.

57
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,799
You always
say that.

58
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,566
I do? Oh, my God.

59
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,874
All right.

60
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:11,409
I guess just try to relax and get
yourself comfortable.

61
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,850
Listen to the sound of my voice
as I count back.

62
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,581
Ten...

63
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,784
Nine...

64
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,588
Eight, seven, six...

65
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,463
Your eyes are
getting heavier...

66
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,330
...and heavier.

67
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,197
Five, four.

68
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,071
They're almost closed.
They're almost closed.

69
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,974
Three, two

70
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,341
and one.

71
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,436
...one.

72
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,709
Very good, Abbey.
Very good.

73
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,774
Very good, Abbey.
Very good.

74
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,713
Let's go back
in time...

75
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,346
Let's go
back in time...

76
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,584
...back into
the past...

77
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,217
...back
into the past...

78
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,292
...to the night of August 2nd
of this year.

79
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,728
...to the night of August 2nd
of this year.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,231
What was the weather
like?

81
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,533
Warm. Warmer than usual,

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,607
even though it's
raining outside.

83
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,942
Okay, good.

84
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,311
Now, let's go back to when you
were with Will,

85
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,286
just before the intruder
entered your room.

86
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,985
We're making love.

87
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,796
It's nice. It's so...
It's so nice.

88
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,874
He's falling asleep.

89
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,940
Mmm.

90
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,117
Good. So what happens...
What happened next?

91
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,283
I'm awake.
I'm wide awake,

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,184
and we're just
lying here.

93
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,257
What woke you up?

94
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,084
Oh, God!

95
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,026
Someone stabbed him in the chest!
Oh, my God!

96
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,296
Blood everywhere.
There's blood everywhere.

97
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,664
Try to see his face.
Try to see his face.

98
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,724
I can't see it.

99
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,134
My husband!

100
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,865
It just feels like I can't move.
I can't see it.

101
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,930
It feels like we're frozen.
I can't see it.

102
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,671
Abbey. Abbey, Abbey, Abbey,
Abbey. Abbey.

103
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,440
It's all over me!
All over me.

104
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,141
Focus on my voice.
Focus on my voice.

105
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,376
You will be awakened and
conscious

106
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,146
in five, four, three,
two, one.

107
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,791
Abbey. Here. Let me.

108
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,557
If I could just
see his face.

109
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,634
He was killed, and I was right there, Abel.
I was right there.

110
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,767
Yeah, you know, it's as natural
to feel guilt

111
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,436
as it is unnatural to
feel it was your fault.

112
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,236
You know that.

113
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,446
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

114
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:49,025
I think you might want to consider
taking some time off.

115
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,893
Real time, you know?

116
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,406
Because it just might help you find clarity
with what happened.

117
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,912
I have to continue this study.
It meant a lot to Will,

118
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,911
and he would have
wanted me to continue.

119
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,815
Now, why did I know
you were gonna say that?

120
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,548
He would have
wanted me to try and finish it

121
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,852
as soon as I could.

122
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,256
It meant a lot to him.

123
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,513
And how long
had it been at this point

124
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,677
since Will had
passed away?

125
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,019
Two months.

126
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,688
And you guys were already
back to school,

127
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,418
and the kids were
already back to school?

128
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:52,124
I had to try and get some normality
back into life.

129
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,262
I didn't know
what else to do.

130
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,568
Is Nome a place you
can drive into or...

131
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,078
No, you have to
fly around.

132
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,170
Okay.

133
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,374
You can't
get there by road.

134
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,364
Any messages?

135
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,102
No, but Scott's waiting
in your office,

136
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,768
and you have
a 1 :00 and a 2:00.

137
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,175
Thank you.

138
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,541
So, how was it
coming in?

139
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,479
It was
a little bumpy.

140
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,450
You'd think as beautiful
as that sky is

141
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,916
that it wouldn't
be so rough.

142
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,248
The stuff that
really shakes us...

143
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,254
We seldom
ever see coming.

144
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,380
I know, I know.

145
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,856
It's a good saying.

146
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,482
Not every week.

147
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,518
Hi, Scott.
Sorry I'm late.

148
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,223
Hey, Dr. Tyler.

149
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,697
I flew up to Anchorage
this morning,

150
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:39,226
so I'm having
a bit of a slow start.

151
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,865
Please, sit down
and make yourself comfortable.

152
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,752
How are you?

153
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,946
I'm all right.

154
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,756
Have you
been sleeping?

155
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,755
It's...
It's worse.

156
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,323
I wake up in the middle of the night
almost every night,

157
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,497
and I just lie there.

158
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,429
What time does this
normally occur?

159
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,632
Around 2:30, 3:00 in the morning.

160
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,706
And there's nothing unusual
waking you up?

161
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,410
No, nothing.

162
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,743
It's just there's...
There's one thing.

163
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,016
There's an owl
at my window.

164
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,685
An owl?

165
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:44,269
A white owl.
It was just looking at me.

166
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,905
How long
was it there?

167
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,112
Hours.

168
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,513
No matter what I did,
it wouldn't fly away.

169
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,818
It wasn't
scared of me.

170
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,951
What was it doing?

171
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,924
Just staring at me.

172
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,730
Had you ever
seen it before?

173
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,671
Yeah.

174
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,280
Once when I was a kid.

175
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,780
That was
the first time?

176
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,975
Uh-huh.

177
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,145
I guess I've
seen it a lot.

178
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,711
How much is a lot?

179
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,983
Every night this week.

180
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,319
Every night?

181
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,628
You mean every time
you go to bed?

182
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,186
I think it came inside.

183
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,256
Was your window open?

184
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,426
No.

185
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,103
I wonder how
it got in.

186
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,670
I don't know, but I remember it
looking down at me.

187
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,309
Over your bed?

188
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,210
Yeah, I think so.
I...

189
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,710
It's really hard
to remember.

190
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,585
It's almost like...
Like it didn't happen.

191
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,521
Like, you know,
in a dream.

192
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,161
Like I just dreamt it.

193
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,961
Can you come see me
tomorrow?

194
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,965
Sure, if you think
I should, or if it's important.

195
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,498
Yeah, I do.
I do think it's important,

196
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,138
and it's nothing
to be alarmed at, at all,

197
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,050
but there have been
some strange coincidences here,

198
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,986
and I just... I feel like I need
to try something new.

199
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,055
What do you mean?

200
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,785
You're not the first patient
I've had

201
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,726
who's experienced
something like this.

202
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,886
I felt so sorry
for my baby,

203
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,629
and I feel responsible.

204
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,895
Can you just
knock it off?

205
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,233
Conversion disorder
is not a phenomenon

206
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,363
that a lot of
people understand,

207
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,740
and we've had to make
quite an adjustment.

208
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,936
When did Ashley
go blind?

209
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,516
After what happened to Will,

210
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,211
she just lost her sight.

211
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,358
Hey, baby.

212
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,691
Hi, Mommy.

213
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,930
How was rehearsal
for the play?

214
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,595
Hey, what's wrong?

215
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,071
Nothing.

216
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,476
Come on.

217
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,781
Come on, cough it up.
What happened?

218
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,428
Ralph called me
a faker.

219
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,987
What? A faker?

220
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,865
He said that
I could see before,

221
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,731
and now I was
just pretending.

222
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,826
What a jerk.

223
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,370
He said that
I just wanted everybody

224
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,464
to feel sorry
for me because of Daddy.

225
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,028
Dear Lord, thank you
for everything we have.

226
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,125
Please continue
to bless our family,

227
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,400
and please continue to help Ashley
overcome her challenges,

228
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,500
and help
all of us to heal.

229
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,010
In Jesus' name
we pray. Amen.

230
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,239
Amen.

231
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,684
Hey, what time
is the game tomorrow?

232
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,152
7:00.

233
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,222
And who are you
playing again?

234
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,986
I already told you, Browerville.

235
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,720
Well, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I must have forgot.

236
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,259
Dad never forgot.

237
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,203
Yeah, and Dad's
not here anymore.

238
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,704
No, he's not.

239
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,950
Can you
accept it yet?

240
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,320
Okay, Ronnie, not in front of
your sister, okay?

241
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,154
We'll talk
about it later.

242
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,284
What do you mean?

243
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,657
Nothing, honey.

244
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,155
How Dad died.

245
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,995
All right, Ronnie.
What is wrong with you?

246
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,001
You go around helping other people
with their problems...

247
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,536
Stop it.
Stop it!

248
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,037
...but you can't even
help yourself.

249
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,801
What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

250
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,170
Ronnie.

251
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,539
Mommy?
What did...

252
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,645
What does he mean?

253
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,677
And do you
think he, in any way,

254
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,510
may have blamed you for
Will's death?

255
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,379
Yes, he did blame me,

256
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:11,284
and he said that
I couldn't help him

257
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,652
or Ashley or anyone,
and he was right.

258
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,296
A small number
continue to experience

259
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,496
debilitating
sleep disorders,

260
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,665
and this seems to be the trend
throughout Nome,

261
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,767
and a cause remains unknown.

262
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,439
Even during the night months,
they can't sleep.

263
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,713
We've seen over 300 people
throughout Nome

264
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,883
who are all exhibiting
the same symptoms.

265
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,118
Around 3:00 in the morning, they are awakened
for no apparent reason,

266
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,959
and they wake up apprehensive,
frightened, panicked,

267
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,632
as if something's
about to happen.

268
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,223
Whether or not
this is related...

269
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,291
Daddy?

270
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,361
...to the missing people
or disappearances...

271
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,303
No, my baby,

272
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,399
it's just a recording
of Daddy's voice.

273
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:44,575
Come over here. I got you.
Come up on the bed.

274
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:49,916
My angel.

275
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,560
Okay, you're doing
real good, Tommy.

276
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:10,074
When I get to one,
you will be asleep,

277
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,942
very, very relaxed.

278
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,278
Four, three,

279
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,947
two and one.

280
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,192
Can you hear me?

281
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,961
Yes.

282
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,297
And when was
the last time

283
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,606
you had trouble sleeping?

284
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,745
Last night.

285
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,586
And did you see the owl?

286
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:57,947
Yeah.

287
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,886
Good.
And what did it look like?

288
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,328
...what did it look like?

289
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,096
Tommy?

290
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,661
I...

291
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,303
I don't remember.

292
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,677
You don't remember
what the owl looks like?

293
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,539
No.

294
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,916
No, I don't see
the owl.

295
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,918
I don't see
the owl now.

296
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,309
It's not there
anymore.

297
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,514
It's not
there anymore.

298
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,578
Did it fly away?

299
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,919
Did it fly away?

300
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,288
No, I think it's...

301
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,520
No,
I think it's...

302
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,354
I don't really
remember it...

303
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,526
I don't really
remember it...

304
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,804
...ever
being there.

305
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,397
...ever
being there.

306
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,317
There's something outside my door.
It's gonna open it.

307
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,682
The door's opening.

308
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,257
Oh, my God.

309
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,829
Oh, my God!

310
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,798
No.

311
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,200
What's wrong?

312
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,268
Oh, Jesus! Tommy,
what's wrong?

313
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,705
No, no, no!

314
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,306
No, no!

315
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,507
No, no, no! No, no, no!
Okay, Tommy, when I count to three,

316
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,567
you will awaken.

317
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,840
No, no, no!

318
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,074
...to conscious...
No!

319
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,410
Three!
No!

320
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,348
No, no! No!

321
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,942
Three!
No!

322
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,855
Tommy,
it's not happening.

323
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,824
It's a memory.
This is not real.

324
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,391
It is real.

325
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,257
Did I do that?

326
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,972
Yeah, you did, Tommy, but it's okay.
It's okay.

327
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,872
What did you see?

328
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,737
Nothing.

329
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,873
What?

330
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,509
Nothing.

331
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,110
You said
you saw something.

332
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,553
No, I didn't
see anything.

333
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,319
I didn't
see anything.

334
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,091
I'm just trying
to help you.

335
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:23,863
If you want to help me,
get me out of this room.

336
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:32,174
I need to go home. I need to go home.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

337
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,378
Tommy, are you trying to convince me
or you?

338
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,282
Did you see
what was bothering you at night?

339
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,849
Did you see the owl?

340
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,958
Can we talk about this
next time?

341
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,864
Yeah, of course.
Sure.

342
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,668
Talk to me when you need to.

343
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,643
Yeah. Okay.

344
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,416
Call in EMTs, Search, everybody.
I want everybody.

345
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,394
Transfer me into that house.
Right now.

346
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:08,895
Tommy here.

347
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,805
Yeah, what's going on
in there?

348
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,408
I want to talk
to Abbey Tyler.

349
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,705
Abbey?

350
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,144
Abbey's not here right now,
but I can help you.

351
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,738
I have to
talk to her!

352
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,912
Hello?

353
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,854
I need you down
here at Tommy's house.

354
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,653
August?
He's gone crazy.

355
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,092
He's holding his family hostage,
and he's asking for you.

356
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,856
Okay, I'll be right there.

357
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,366
Bring her up here.

358
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,468
She's here right now.

359
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,741
We'll walk her up to you, okay, Tommy?
It's gonna be all right.

360
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,009
Just give her the phone. Give her the phone.
I want to talk to her.

361
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,051
Both arms out. Both arms out.
She's here.

362
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,518
Put her on the phone
right now.

363
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,555
I'm gonna do it right now, okay?
Is this really necessary?

364
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,522
I want to talk to her!
Can somebody tell me what's going on?

365
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,615
Where is she?
Take it easy, all right?

366
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,183
I don't see her.
Get her up here! August, what's going on?

367
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,355
I need you to calm him down and get him
thinking rationally.

368
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,626
He's got Sarah,
Timothy and Joe lined up

369
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,998
in the kitchen with
a gun to their heads,

370
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,367
and he wants to talk to you for some reason,
all right?

371
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,462
Watch your step.

372
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,904
Straight this way.

373
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:20,377
Tommy? Tommy, what...
What's going on here?

374
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,940
I'm so sorry,
but I've gotta do this.

375
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,214
I don't have
a choice.

376
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:32,689
It was completely surreal to be there
in the middle of the night

377
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,553
with all those
police trucks.

378
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,853
I don't have
a choice.

379
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,327
No, no, no.
You have a choice, Tommy.

380
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,761
We always
have a choice.

381
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,526
Not this time.
Please, Tommy!

382
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,568
Yes. Yes, you do.
You have the choice

383
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,103
right now to just...
To just stop.

384
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,934
Just put down
the gun, Tommy.

385
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,840
You have it within your power
to just stop.

386
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,003
Please, before
somebody gets hurt.

387
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,172
Tommy, look at
Sarah, Tommy.

388
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,714
Look at...
Look at your wife.

389
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,576
Look at your
children, Tommy.

390
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,675
It's okay.
It's okay.

391
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,016
You would never
let anything happen to them.

392
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,487
You love them
so much.

393
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,786
I know what
keeps us up at night.

394
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,316
And if you saw
what I saw,

395
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,521
you would
understand.

396
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,564
What did you
see, Tommy?

397
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,432
It doesn't matter,
because we're not gonna

398
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,196
have to see it
ever again.

399
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,428
Just wait, Tommy.
I can help you.

400
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,667
Just talk to me, okay?
We'll talk as long as you need to.

401
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,005
We'll get
through this, Tommy.

402
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,806
If anybody's got a clear shot,
take it now.

403
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:28,937
Negative.

404
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,039
I don't have a clear shot, sir.
The wife is blocking him.

405
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,174
And he wasn't
listening to me.

406
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,410
Do you know what
Zimabu Eter means?

407
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,577
And they were
going to kill him.

408
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,486
What? Wait. I can't hear you, Tommy.
What?

409
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,852
Has anybody
got the shot?

410
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:42,415
Zimabu Eter!
Zimabu Eter! Zimabu Eter!

411
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,620
What the hell
does that mean?

412
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,953
Zimabu Eter? I don't know, Tommy.
What the hell does that mean?

413
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,055
Anybody got
the goddamn shot?

414
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,066
But I can find out.
Just give me a little time.

415
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,294
I need to know now!

416
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,494
Just give me
a little time.

417
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,434
I will find out for you.I promise.
Right now!

418
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,631
No, please!

419
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,798
You can't help me.

420
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,340
I love you.

421
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,471
Move, move!

422
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,516
Move, move, move!

423
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,618
Tommy! God damn it!

424
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,276
I'm having a hard time

425
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,647
understanding what
happened here.

426
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,949
I know. I know.

427
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,090
You don't know what he saw?
- So you have no idea what he saw?

428
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,489
He didn't tell me.
He didn't tell me.

429
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,357
What did
he tell you?

430
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,501
That what he thought he saw
wasn't an owl.

431
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,831
That it was
something else.

432
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,505
And that's what was keeping him
up at night?

433
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,233
Yeah.

434
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,606
So he was under hypnosis
when he saw this?

435
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,043
Yeah.

436
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,182
And how do you
know what he saw was real?

437
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,847
I don't know
that it was.

438
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,219
So what you're saying is that Tommy might
have done all of this

439
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,523
based on something
that was imaginary.

440
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,027
All I know is that he believed
what he saw,

441
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,966
and there was more fear
in his eyes

442
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,237
than I've ever
seen in my life.

443
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,473
Had you not
hypnotized him,

444
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,379
do you think he would have
done this?

445
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,147
What do you mean?

446
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,053
I'm just
wondering,

447
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,318
without this
hypnotism,

448
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,894
do you think he still would have
murdered his family?

449
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,327
That is a ridiculous
and offensive question.

450
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,633
No, what's ridiculous
and offensive

451
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,675
is that an entire family is
lying in a morgue

452
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,506
from a murder-suicide,

453
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,670
and the last
meaningful contact

454
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,873
that the murderer
had was with you.

455
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,415
No, what
happened tonight

456
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,008
would have manifested itself
eventually.

457
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,015
He was suppressing
something.

458
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,113
Look, in 13 years
of practice,

459
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,558
I've never witnessed something
to this extent.

460
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,226
Abbey, why didn't
you contact us

461
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,931
if you suspected
he was unstable

462
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,000
after an admittedly
violent episode?

463
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:40,060
He was completely coherent when
he left my office.

464
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,572
Now, I had no reason
to suspect...

465
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,435
I called his wife to ask her to
keep an eye on him.

466
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,238
And now
she's dead.

467
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,980
Okay, I'm not going
to sit here and listen

468
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,647
to how hypnosis-induced
murder caused this.

469
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,622
Jesus, I am trying to find out...
This is ridiculous.

470
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,422
...what caused one of the worst murders
in the history of Nome.

471
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,224
There's something going on in this town
that we don't understand.

472
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,731
There's something happening to people
in their sleep...

473
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,324
Well, I don't know
about any of that!

474
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,232
I don't understand
what you're talking about!

475
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,736
I don't deal
in hallucinations.

476
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,602
I don't deal in the visions
in the ether.

477
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,970
What in the hell
are you talking about?

478
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,736
I'm dealing in real
flesh and blood things,

479
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,278
four of whom
are lying on slabs next door.

480
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,439
How dare you?
My husband was lying on one of those slabs

481
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,674
and you still
haven't found his killer.

482
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,580
Abbey, now, you know damn well
what happened to Will.

483
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,675
That case is closed.

484
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,219
No, you cannot
file things away

485
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,686
without getting to
what really happened.

486
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,054
Now, there are more unsolved murders
and missing people in Nome...

487
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,888
Sit down.
...than any other town in Alaska,

488
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,428
three years of which have been
under your watch.

489
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,726
Now, what is happening in this town
is very real,

490
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,822
and it must be acknowledged.

491
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,492
Sit down!

492
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,206
You stop whatever
this governmental study is,

493
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,181
this hypnosis, whatever it is,

494
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,080
whatever you and
Will were after.

495
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,779
It's bringing nothing but bad news to
a town that's had enough.

496
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,219
Now, I don't care how
important it is to you.

497
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,588
I don't care how hard you've worked on it.
I don't care.

498
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,117
You're not gonna use the people of Nome
for a goddamn rat study.

499
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,043
I felt
responsible
for...

500
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,076
...death,
and his family's.

501
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,713
And at the time,
after all that happened,

502
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,688
I still
didn't know
why he did it.

503
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:45,156
All of the patients reported seeing
the same owl,

504
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:52,935
but Tommy mentioned
that his memory of the owl was wrong

505
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,073
and that he didn't
see it anymore.

506
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,441
It was some sort of
false recollection.

507
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,576
The question is,

508
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,921
if under hypnosis, will the others
feel the same way?

509
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,819
Will they see
what he saw?

510
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,832
We have to proceed
with extreme caution.

511
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:33,637
What happened here
remains unexplained, like Will.

512
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,087
Abel?

513
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:57,100
I heard what happened.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

514
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,965
Hey.
You flew all the way up here?

515
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,698
That's all right.
That's okay.

516
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,262
I'm worried
about you.

517
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,739
You didn't have to.
I'm fine.

518
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,207
Yeah?
Yeah.

519
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,635
You want to talk?

520
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,680
I can't.
I can't cancel my schedule.

521
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,544
Theresa, good morning.
Can you transcribe this for me, please?

522
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,915
Do you want me to
cancel your meetings?

523
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,318
No, no. Thank you.

524
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,185
So, how you feeling?

525
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,753
I feel like
I just need to start my day.

526
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,227
Yeah.

527
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,163
Maybe it's...
You think it's

528
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,166
time that you,
maybe, stepped back?

529
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,233
Maybe consider
it a sabbatical?

530
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,103
I love that word.

531
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,769
It doesn't actually sound like what it means,
which is "time off."

532
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,677
Abbey, listen,
you need to step away for perspective,

533
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,647
clarity on
what's happened.

534
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,417
I mean, you can't
continue like this.

535
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,478
No, I can,
and I have to.

536
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,992
It's the only thing
I have within my power.

537
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,188
It's all I have left,
is to continue,

538
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,855
to find out what's
causing all of this.

539
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,963
I can't...
I don't...

540
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,496
I don't believe that it can be just chalked up
to coincidence,

541
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,867
what happened to Will,
what happened to Tommy and his family.

542
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,705
I don't.

543
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,005
Not in this town.

544
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,446
Do you mind
if I stay on a bit?

545
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,143
Just kept an eye
on you,

546
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,045
since you're not
too keen on doing it yourself?

547
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,048
It's all right.

548
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,867
So, lots to
talk about.

549
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,838
What happened to Tommy?

550
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:43,965
I can't discuss...

551
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,410
He's dead.
You should be able to discuss everything.

552
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,639
It had
something...

553
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:56,779
I believe that it had something to do
with his sleeping habits.

554
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,717
We're really worried,
obviously.

555
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,653
It's the second suicide
in a couple of months.

556
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,097
I understand.

557
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,896
We want you to
hypnotize me, too.

558
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,502
We need to know if there's anything
I'm not remembering,

559
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,701
and I feel...

560
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,939
We feel like the best thing to do
is to face it.

561
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,512
We've already
thought it over.

562
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,820
If you want to
undergo this,

563
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,063
we're gonna have to go about this
very delicately.

564
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,796
Would it be all right if a colleague of mine,
Dr. Campos,

565
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,268
came in
to observe?

566
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,433
Yeah, sure.

567
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,646
Okay.

568
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:03,779
Five. Deeper, deeper.
You're totally relaxed.

569
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:09,792
Four, three,
two and one.

570
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,693
So, when was the last time
you had trouble sleeping?

571
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,964
Last night.

572
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,939
And do you remember
seeing anything unusual last night?

573
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,502
An owl.

574
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,848
Tell me about
the owl.

575
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,383
Tell me about the owl.

576
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:42,287
It's a beige owl.

577
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,056
Its eyes are big,
like...

578
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:53,633
I don't know.
It doesn't look like a normal owl.

579
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,138
It doesn't look
like a normal owl.

580
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,806
Scott?

581
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,540
There is no owl.
It's not...

582
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,284
Honey, honey,
honey, wake up.

583
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,225
You hear that?
Wake up.

584
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,659
She's not...
She's not waking up.

585
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,995
Someone's outside
the door.

586
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,475
Tell me
what you see.

587
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,983
Something's out there.

588
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,609
Can you see
who it is?

589
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:47,448
Not who, what.
I know what they are.

590
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,226
They come all
the time since I was little.

591
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,426
What are they?

592
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,029
They're gonna
open the door.

593
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,439
They get in without
setting off the alarm.

594
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,737
I armed it.
I know... I know I did.

595
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,242
I thought they only come
when I think about them,

596
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,913
but I wasn't thinking about
them tonight.

597
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:34,062
Okay, Scott, I'm gonna count to three,
and you're gonna wake up.

598
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,368
One, two, three!

599
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,202
Scott! Scott!
Scott, wake up!

600
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,472
Here you go.
Go ahead.

601
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,577
I'm sorry.

602
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,952
It's unbelievable.

603
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,220
It doesn't
make any sense.

604
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,928
Scott, you don't
have to rush.

605
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,300
Whenever you're ready,
you can tell us what you saw.

606
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,470
I saw them.

607
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,474
Who's them?

608
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,877
They're not
from here.

609
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,744
What do you mean?

610
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,644
I can't describe it.
I can't see what's in my own mind.

611
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,154
I can't control it.

612
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,128
All I can see
is the owl, but l...

613
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,566
I know it's not an owl,
but l...

614
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:16,368
I remember the smell,
like a... Like a putrid cinnamon.

615
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,276
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

616
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,040
The worst part

617
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,744
was the voice
inside my head, like...

618
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,716
'Cause they
talk to you

619
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,520
so you can
hear them, but...

620
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,853
They also talk
inside your mind,

621
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,659
Iike you're connected
or something.

622
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,237
And they take me away to somewhere,
but I can't remember,

623
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,769
and I can't remember
what they do to me.

624
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,900
Okay, okay, Scott,
that's enough for today.

625
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,443
I'm so sorry.

626
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,811
It's gonna
be all right.

627
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:01,440
Cindy, under
the circumstances,

628
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,248
I'm going to contact Sheriff August

629
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,981
to let him know
that we've met

630
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,886
and let him know
that we've had this session.

631
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,549
Yeah, please do.

632
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,653
Okay.

633
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,989
Now, I know why...
did what he did.

634
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,895
Why?

635
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,706
You'd have to
have seen it,

636
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,403
felt it,
what it is.

637
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,270
What is it?

638
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,072
The worst.

639
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,446
Of what?

640
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,817
That you could...
You could ever imagine.

641
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:47,525
Come on.
Babe, let's go home.

642
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,796
We're going home.

643
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,246
What the hell
was that?

644
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,376
Abel.

645
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,510
Hmm?

646
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:16,216
Do you believe in
abduction theories?

647
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,557
What do you mean,
like kidnappings?

648
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:23,862
Yeah.
No. No, not...

649
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:29,603
Not kidnappings,
but abduction, as in...

650
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,208
You don't mean alien abductions,
do you?

651
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:37,008
Well, you know,
I think that might be what we just heard.

652
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,140
When you look at the statistics, they're
pretty impressive.

653
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:43,209
I mean, Will was kind of into that,
and he did a little research.

654
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,787
You know, there are
over 11 million people

655
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,517
that have either
reported seeing

656
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,652
or know someone
who has seen UFOs since the 1930s.

657
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,524
The idea of any of this stuff being real is...
You can't...

658
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,396
Come on, Abel.
I mean, when something

659
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,766
boasts 11 million
witnesses...

660
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,863
You know, that would
win any court case in the world.

661
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,805
Well, and there are
just as many

662
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,638
explanations and reasons.

663
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:15,384
Weather balloons, atmospheric effects,
optical illusions.

664
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,183
In this case, perhaps,
hypnocognic hallucinations.

665
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,424
Listen, we have to deal with hard,
empirical evidence

666
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,360
and facts.
We can't...

667
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,993
Abbey! Abbey.
The tape.

668
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,460
The tape you gave
me this morning...

669
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,003
Wait. Slow down.
Slow down, Theresa.

670
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,505
What is it?
Did you listen to it?

671
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,172
I don't... I don't know
what this is.

672
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:45,738
I don't know
what's going on.

673
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,081
I don't want to
listen to it again.

674
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,483
That was weird.

675
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,546
Abbey?

676
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,990
That's you?

677
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,025
That's not
my voice.

678
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,057
That's not me.

679
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,600
After you heard that,
what did you, like...

680
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,305
How did you react?

681
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,075
After the initial shock,

682
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,414
I was in denial.

683
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,148
It couldn't be me,
my voice.

684
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,028
So, what
happened next?

685
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,928
I went through
what I could hold onto.

686
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,361
Which were
what?

687
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,926
Which were the facts.

688
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:26,342
I went home to
try and recount

689
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,469
what happened
during the recording.

690
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,605
I was sleeping
in my bed

691
00:47:58,675 --> 00:47:59,699
when my door opened.

692
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,123
Someone or something came
into my room.

693
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,726
Did it cause
that somehow?

694
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,007
Some kind of
allergic reaction?

695
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,200
How long had it
been there?

696
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,944
But whatever, whoever it was,
I fought it.

697
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,184
But it was too strong,
and it took me away.

698
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:46,119
The moment it became too real

699
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,714
was when I looked down
at the floorboards

700
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:53,485
and I saw scratches
leading all the way to the door.

701
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,833
I put myself
back together.

702
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:04,606
I was determined
to figure out what it was,

703
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,209
what came
into my room,

704
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,880
what it was saying,
where it took me,

705
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,614
and what it
did to me.

706
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:18,446
I listened to that
tape over and over

707
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,923
to figure out anything,

708
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:30,794
something to explain what it was.

709
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,033
It wasn't Latin.

710
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,764
It wasn't Greek.

711
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:41,201
It wasn't any language
that I had heard before,

712
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:47,814
and I felt
it was the key

713
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,477
to everything
that was happening

714
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,084
to me, to Will,

715
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,552
and everyone else
in Nome.

716
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,661
And then I found exactly what
I was looking for.

717
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,895
- Hello?
- Hello.

718
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,499
Is this Dr...

719
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,435
Awolowa Odusami.

720
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,133
Yes, this is he.

721
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,799
Hi, I was wondering,

722
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,869
are you familiar with a person named
Dr. William Tyler?

723
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,514
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.

724
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,342
Okay.

725
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,648
May I ask
who's speaking?

726
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,417
I'm...

727
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,686
Will you tell me
your name?

728
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,715
Hello?
- Listen,

729
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,389
there was a man who called me
from this number.

730
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,362
He called himself John.

731
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,432
There's no John here.

732
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,797
Exactly, I know.

733
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:51,536
What was he...
Why was he calling you?

734
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:57,172
He wanted to have
a history lesson on ancient languages.

735
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,817
Look, l...

736
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,983
That was my husband
that you talked to,

737
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:14,530
and he's been murdered.

738
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,656
Dr...

739
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,859
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry to hear that.

740
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,424
...he
listened to me.

741
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,492
Yeah.

742
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,629
He didn't judge me

743
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,140
or try to
analyze me.

744
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:26,566
I just...
I need...

745
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,167
He just listened.

746
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:29,569
I need you
to hear me out.

747
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,240
And then
he flew over to Nome.

748
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,700
I thought it was Akkadian,
but it's not.

749
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,109
It's Sumerian.
I'm sure of it.

750
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,647
This is widely
considered by my peers

751
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:07,842
to be the Holy Grail of
dead languages,

752
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,377
but we haven't
deciphered the entire lexicon.

753
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,228
"Our creation" is
the last two words.

754
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,960
I'm not sure of
the first two.

755
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,632
"Examine" is
the first word.

756
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,976
The last word is
"ruin" or "destroy."

757
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:47,649
"Our creation,"
"examine," "ruin," or "destroy."

758
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,118
Ruin, destroy who?

759
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,559
It's an incomplete
translation.

760
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,427
We can't be sure
of exactly what's being said.

761
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,056
But whatever it is,
it sounds aggressive.

762
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:00,967
I'm sorry, but none of this
is any making sense.

763
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,497
It's a verbalized recording

764
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,768
of the Sumerian
language.

765
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,276
Now, we're talking about
the oldest language in human history

766
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:11,178
for whatever reason recorded in your room.

767
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,606
What was happening?
What was being done to me?

768
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,846
What is unsettling is
that whatever it is,

769
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,819
the vocals,
they don't sound...

770
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,453
Ordinary.
Human?

771
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,086
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

772
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,890
Okay? Let's not fuel
any more of these fires.

773
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,895
Now, there's any number of reasons

774
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,805
for the distortion
in the voice.

775
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,666
I'm not jumping
to any conclusions,

776
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,038
but her voice
sounded fine.

777
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,380
The tape could have
been recorded over, for one,

778
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,146
and part of the old tape could
still be heard.

779
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,448
No, I don't recycle tapes.

780
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,421
Well, maybe this time you did.

781
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,787
And that still
does not explain

782
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,985
why that voice is
speaking a language

783
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,426
that predates
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

784
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,998
Now, I've studied the Sumerian civilization
for most of my career,

785
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:07,662
and what I have
found is intriguing.

786
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,239
You can go into
any Sumerian exhibit

787
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,644
and see what I am
about to tell you.

788
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:21,707
Drawings of rockets that look like Apollo
launching into the sky.

789
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,820
Etchings and sculptures
of men in spacesuits

790
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,220
and what look
like oxygen masks.

791
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:32,217
And this artwork was created in the fourth
millennium B.C.E.,

792
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,320
4,000 years before Christ
walked the Earth.

793
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,957
"Genesis," Noah's ark,
to name a few.

794
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,864
Both of these stories
existed in Sumer

795
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,926
6,000 years before
the Bible was written.

796
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,700
"Genesis" came from
the Sumerian epic of creation.

797
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:46,571
Noah's ark came from
the Sumerian deluge.

798
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,802
The alien-god legend
has its basis,

799
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,779
its origins,
in Sumerian history.

800
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,617
You can find everything I've described
in a museum right now.

801
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:02,683
You know, it is one thing to
entertain wild theories,

802
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,328
but quite another
to invest in them.

803
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:11,290
Yes, and you're
entitled to that reaction,

804
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,734
but as I said from the beginning,
I draw no conclusions.

805
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,168
I'm dealing in facts.

806
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,229
Now, this is drawn
from thousands of years

807
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,741
of data research
and collection.

808
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,207
How this is put together is
open to debate.

809
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,145
Do you honestly
believe you were forcibly

810
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,979
removed
from your bedroom

811
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,512
by members of
an alien race?

812
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,259
Hello?
Abbey, can you
come over? It's Scott.

813
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,229
Something's wrong.
He wants you to come over. He...

814
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:44,323
Cindy? Hold on a second.
Just take a deep breath.

815
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,324
Hi, Cindy.
Hey.

816
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,628
This is Dr. Odusami.
He's here to help.

817
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,724
Good morning.

818
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:19,860
Come in.

819
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:25,630
Scott?

820
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,766
What took you
so long?

821
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,277
I'm sorry.
I came as quick as I could.

822
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,245
Last night was...

823
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,440
Calm down.

824
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:33,880
Calm down?
Scott.

825
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,076
How can l?
You don't...

826
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,846
Scott.
Scott, I'm here, all right?

827
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,889
Now, you've gotta try and breathe for me.
You have to calm yourself,

828
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,720
because I cannot
help you if you're all wound up.

829
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,987
I don't want to talk about it,
but I have to.

830
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,791
Have to, have to,
have to...

831
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,195
I have to, I have to,
I have to...

832
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,690
Scott, why are you...

833
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,030
I have to.

834
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,228
What is this?
How did you get this?

835
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,572
I don't know.
I didn't know it was there. I just...

836
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,440
Okay. Can we set up
the camera, please?

837
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,647
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't need anyone...

838
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,047
I don't want
this getting out.

839
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,449
Scott, we need
to record what's happening.

840
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,215
We need to record
this session for study,

841
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:15,223
so we can find out
what's going on with you.

842
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,257
Okay, I don't want
to go under.

843
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,987
Well, we don't have
to do that.

844
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,464
Just try and relay
whatever you remember.

845
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,302
There's things I have
to remember, but l...

846
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:32,402
But I can't.
I can't without...

847
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,738
You know what?
We can put you under a very light hypnosis.

848
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,505
Okay?

849
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,373
But if you're worried...

850
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,678
I have to.
I have to remember.

851
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,616
I have to get
this out of my head.

852
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,712
It feels like it's
just dug in there

853
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,950
and I can't think
straight anymore.

854
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,622
It's okay.
It's okay.

855
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,923
I have to...

856
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,495
I'll do it.

857
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,624
Are you sure?

858
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,758
Yeah.

859
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:01,228
Okay.

860
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:04,439
Are we ready?

861
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,365
Okay.

862
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,874
It's okay.
Okay?

863
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,114
Relax.
Just relax.

864
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:23,286
There's a lot of people in the room
with you now.

865
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,792
You're not alone.

866
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,355
Relax.

867
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,533
By the time I reach one,
you will be asleep.

868
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,862
Five, four,

869
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:41,176
three, two,

870
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:44,537
one.

871
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:11,897
Scott?

872
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,388
But where are
we going?

873
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,655
North Carolina.

874
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:08,727
North Carolina?
Mmm-hmm.

875
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,026
What's in
North Carolina?

876
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,259
Us, by tomorrow.

877
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,562
But I have
a game tomorrow.

878
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,569
Pack your bags.

879
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,310
Hello? I don't think
she feels like talking to you right now.

880
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,106
Mommy?
Yeah, baby.

881
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,203
What's wrong?

882
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,542
Nothing, sweetie.

883
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,708
We're just gonna
go take a little break, okay?

884
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:28,808
It's Abel.

885
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:29,874
Tell him
I'll call him back.

886
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:30,976
She'll call you back.

887
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,022
He says he has to talk to you.
I'll call you back, Abel.

888
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,954
He's already on his way.

889
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,958
Are we gonna see Grandma
and Grandpa?

890
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,257
No, baby,
Grandma and Grandpa are gone, remember?

891
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,597
Yeah, they're with Daddy.

892
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,360
I mean Grandpa and Grandma Lilly.

893
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,129
No, we're not going
to see them, either.

894
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,863
But why not?

895
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,536
Baby, I'm just gonna sit you
down right here,

896
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:55,042
and you've gotta let Mommy pack, okay?
Thank you.

897
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:57,079
It's 'cause of Dad, huh?

898
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:03,109
Ronnie, I really need you to help me
right now, okay?

899
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,421
Please take your
sister into her room

900
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,581
and help her get ready, okay?

901
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,088
Thank you.

902
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:13,520
Mom?

903
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,720
Yeah?

904
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:16,958
What did you do?

905
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,097
Hold on!

906
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,404
What happened
to Scott?

907
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:28,466
August, I'm sorry.

908
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,307
He's paralyzed
from the neck down.

909
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:34,076
Three of the vertebrate in his neck
are completely severed!

910
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,475
Huh?

911
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,319
I don't know.
Huh?

912
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:38,410
You were there.

913
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,580
I can't explain it.
I can't...

914
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:40,679
Tell me
what happened.

915
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,384
How'd he
break his back?

916
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,450
I put him under,
and there was something...

917
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,156
Something was
inside of him

918
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,200
that twisted his body,
and that...

919
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,996
Something was
inside of him,

920
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,559
and it twisted
his body?

921
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,602
And you have
proof of this?

922
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:59,266
It didn't record.
It was all distorted.

923
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,570
Abbey...

924
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:05,712
How in God's name
am I supposed to believe this?

925
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:06,839
I know what I saw.

926
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,213
Yeah, what you saw?

927
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,546
I know what I saw.
What you saw?

928
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,553
Abbey, what you're doing is
hurting people,

929
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,316
very obviously!

930
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,254
Now, my heart goes out to you,
it really does,

931
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:16,689
what you've been through.
I understand that,

932
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,818
but you leave me
no choice.

933
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,192
You have the right
to remain silent.

934
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,287
What?

935
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,763
Anything you say
or do can and will

936
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,424
be held against you
in a court of law.

937
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,263
No, stop. Stop.

938
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,561
You have the right
to an attorney.

939
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,661
August.

940
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,798
August, please,
don't do this.

941
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,705
Ryan!
Sheriff, no.

942
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,674
Ryan, you can't.
Please. You can't...

943
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,649
You can't take me away from my children.
August, please, don't.

944
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:43,651
August. August,
I know what this looks like.

945
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,779
I know what this looks like,
but I was there.

946
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,350
I saw it.

947
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,120
You were there,
and you saw what?

948
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:52,653
What did you see?

949
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,060
Well, it's the kind
of thing that...

950
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:57,688
Well, you'd have
to have seen it.

951
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,325
No. Bullshit.

952
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,768
Now, this woman is not
capable of committing

953
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,930
any physical harm
to any man.

954
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,563
I don't know what
she is capable of...

955
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,404
She's not capable.
You know. You know. Hey!

956
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,138
Just calm down
for a second and hear me out.

957
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,910
I know that what's happening here in
Nome is frightening.

958
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,075
I know it is.

959
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,714
But whatever you do,
you cannot arrest her

960
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:18,845
for something you
don't understand

961
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,912
just because you're terrified.
Come on.

962
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,958
You're pushing it.
You're pushing it.

963
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,186
I mean, I was there.
I saw it.

964
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,819
Now you're gonna take her away
from her children

965
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,386
for something
that she did not do.

966
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,489
Come on.
Come on.

967
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:31,726
Let's just calm down.

968
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,325
Please. Please.

969
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:37,729
You will be under
24-hour supervision,

970
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,298
and you will not
leave these premises.

971
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:44,678
If you touch that doorknob,
I will arrest you!

972
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,845
I understand.
Thank you.

973
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,317
You're coming
with me.

974
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,155
Thank you.

975
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,695
Hey, look after your mom.
It's okay, sweetheart.

976
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:14,837
Ronnie.

977
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,499
This is Ryan, sir.
I'm stationed in front of the Tyler home.

978
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,595
Over.

979
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,038
Roger that.

980
01:05:55,618 --> 01:06:00,487
But they said they were
questioned by Chief...

981
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:04,158
...reminded him about
the disappearances...

982
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,818
What about them?

983
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,363
Homicides,
missing people.

984
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,624
Dozens of them.

985
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:14,465
It's been happening
there since the 1960s,

986
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:18,469
and the FBI have been dropping in
from time to time.

987
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,632
Would you say...

988
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:20,698
What did they find?

989
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:24,735
Nothing.
It's inconclusive.

990
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,640
To this day,
nothing has been solved.

991
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,574
What do you think
it means?

992
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,349
How do you
put it in perspective?

993
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,115
They have different categories

994
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:40,321
for these types
of things.

995
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,457
Different levels.

996
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,264
An encounter of
the first kind,

997
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:48,961
that's when you
see a UFO.

998
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:54,502
The second kind
is when you see evidence of it:

999
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,372
crop circles,
radiation.

1000
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,379
The third kind
is when you make contact.

1001
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,883
But the fourth kind,

1002
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:11,420
there's nothing
more frightening than the fourth.

1003
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:18,459
You see, that one is
when they abduct you.

1004
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,539
And I think it's all
part of the same thing.

1005
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,933
It's all connected,

1006
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,312
to Will,
the missing people,

1007
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,478
to everything in Nome.

1008
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,244
If this type of thing
was happening to Nome,

1009
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,584
to me, I think

1010
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,492
it's happening
to other people.

1011
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:52,733
Not just there,
but all over the world,

1012
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,767
in towns, cities.

1013
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,872
Most of them
don't even know it.

1014
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,442
Know they're abducted?

1015
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,909
How could they know?

1016
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,211
How could they remember
what they're being forced to forget?

1017
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,095
What the hell?

1018
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:33,929
Holy shit.

1019
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,379
Where are they?

1020
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,446
I don't know.

1021
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,083
I tried to tell you...
You don't know?

1022
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,525
I want the video
played back.

1023
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,529
Sir, it didn't
record.

1024
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:02,689
It did,
but nothing
came out.

1025
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,596
Come on! Bullshit!

1026
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,134
Ryan, pull yourself
together, man.

1027
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,146
Calm down. Mom.
What the hell happened?

1028
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,375
They took my baby.
They took her.

1029
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:21,746
Who?

1030
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,216
They took my baby.
What is she talking about?

1031
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,513
Someone kidnapped
Ashley.

1032
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,316
Okay, I want
this entire house
searched.

1033
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,912
I want everybody
inside, outside

1034
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,015
going through these
premises top to bottom.

1035
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,218
Ronnie, what'd you see?

1036
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,056
Nothing.
I came in here and she was gone.

1037
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,857
What's going on here?
August, listen to me.

1038
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:35,988
I'm listening.

1039
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,726
A beam of light
came down,

1040
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,198
and they took her
into the sky.

1041
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:43,636
They took my little girl up into the sky.
I saw it!

1042
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:44,695
Through the
ceiling?

1043
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:45,831
August, I saw it!

1044
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:46,932
Through the ceiling?

1045
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,772
Yes. They took her
through the ceiling.

1046
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:49,970
What is this craziness?

1047
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:51,069
What the hell
is going on here?

1048
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:52,272
I couldn't stop it.

1049
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,713
Okay. Everybody
clear this room!

1050
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:54,806
I want everybody
out of here

1051
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,147
except Ronnie
and Abbey!

1052
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,982
Ronnie, sit down right there, please.
Okay?

1053
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,851
Abbey, you sit down. Please sit down.
My baby.

1054
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,289
Okay? Sit here.
I want to talk to you, okay?

1055
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,417
You just tell me.

1056
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,188
Listen, less than
five hours after I arrest you,

1057
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,991
your daughter
goes missing.

1058
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,052
I told you.

1059
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,120
Yeah, but
that's horseshit.

1060
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,393
We know that
that's not real.

1061
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:12,525
Tell me
what happened.

1062
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,863
You had an officer
outside my house.

1063
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:14,960
Yes, we had
an officer outside.

1064
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,368
What did he see?
He didn't see anything.

1065
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,338
He says that the videotape wasn't playing.
Now, just tell me.

1066
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,431
Where is she?
Listen, Abbey!

1067
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:20,497
What did he see?

1068
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,043
Get him in here right now!
You listen to me now.

1069
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,476
You know what's real!
I want to know what he saw.

1070
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,342
You know what's real!
You had an officer outside my house!

1071
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,438
God damn it!
Where is she?

1072
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,142
You were supposed
to protect us!

1073
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:32,017
Abbey, where is she, God damn it?
You tell me where she is!

1074
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,220
Where is Ashley?
Where is she?

1075
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,191
Mom!
Can't you stop?

1076
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,548
It's okay.
It's okay.

1077
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,117
Please, just stop!

1078
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:44,097
Abbey, you haven't
been right in the head since Will.

1079
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,199
You just haven't been
right in the head.

1080
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:47,792
You haven't
found his killer.

1081
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,064
What?

1082
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,028
You still haven't
found his killer.

1083
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,301
No,
Abbey, we have.
Yes, we have.

1084
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,536
He's still out there.
He's still out there.

1085
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,671
No. Listen, I'm removing him
from your custody.

1086
01:11:58,781 --> 01:11:59,975
No.
Yes, I am,

1087
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,347
and find a lawyer,
because you've run out

1088
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,407
of all the goodwill
I've got, okay?

1089
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,645
He's not
gonna take you away.

1090
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,154
Guys, get in here.
We're removing Ronnie from Abbey's custody!

1091
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,883
No. No, you're not!
You will not...

1092
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,788
- Let go!
- You will not.

1093
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,417
No. No.
Let go!

1094
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,984
No. No, no.
Baby, baby, no!

1095
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,087
Let go. Let go.

1096
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,598
No, no.
You're not
taking my boy!

1097
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,065
I'm sorry.
You're not taking my boy!

1098
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,931
He'll be safe! He'll be safe!

1099
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,868
You're not
taking my boy!

1100
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,417
God!

1101
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,895
My babies!

1102
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,105
Why are you doing this?

1103
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:04,276
All I realized,
that they weren't going to be able to find her.

1104
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,647
That I would have
to do it on my own.

1105
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,615
But you couldn't leave.

1106
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:14,146
No, that's not what I mean.
I had to...

1107
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,821
To find a way
to go directly to them,

1108
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:24,097
directly to
the source.

1109
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,136
I know what I saw,
but l...

1110
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,708
I can't accept it.
I can't.

1111
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,021
So please don't
ask me to, because I can't.

1112
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,093
I still have to
do this.

1113
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,652
But Scott, you...

1114
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,636
Is this the right way?

1115
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:11,900
I don't know.

1116
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,474
I don't have a choice.

1117
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,374
Yeah.
I know you don't.

1118
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,888
Your eyes are
feeling heavier.

1119
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,389
Seven, six,

1120
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,763
five, four,

1121
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:46,740
three, two

1122
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,367
and one.

1123
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,845
Abbey?
Yes.

1124
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:58,052
Let's go back
three days, to Tuesday,

1125
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:02,581
when you were giving dictation
in your bedroom.

1126
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:04,456
Yes.
Good.

1127
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,427
Now, what happened
after you finished your dictation?

1128
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:15,635
...remains unexplained,
and worse, unsolved,

1129
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,470
Iike Will.

1130
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:22,300
Are you sleeping?

1131
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:23,401
Yes.

1132
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,476
What happened next?

1133
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:33,310
There's an owl.

1134
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:34,650
The owl.

1135
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,691
It's looking down at me.
It's looking down at me.

1136
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,353
Is it the same owl
your patients see?

1137
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,494
Yes.
Yes.

1138
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,732
It's smiling.
It's smiling.

1139
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,200
I don't like it
when it smiles.

1140
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,966
I don't like it
when it smiles.

1141
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,473
What do you mean,
smiling?

1142
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,633
I don't know
what I mean.

1143
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,802
I don't know
what I mean.

1144
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:58,277
I don't want to know.
I don't
want to know.

1145
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:01,783
Well, it's too late
to forget what you already know.

1146
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,215
Tell me what you see.

1147
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,156
It's not an owl.
It's not an owl.

1148
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,988
God, help me! Help me!

1149
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,326
No.

1150
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,027
No! No!

1151
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,530
Help me! Help me!

1152
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,469
Help me! Help!

1153
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,109
Abbey,
what is it?

1154
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:08,182
God, help me.

1155
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:13,412
There are too many of them.
It burns. It hurts!

1156
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:23,495
No, no! Please!
Stop it. No.

1157
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:33,204
It's sticking into my shoulder.

1158
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,045
So what happened
in that room?

1159
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,149
They came,

1160
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,455
and we were...

1161
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:06,958
We were...

1162
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:11,425
They abducted us.

1163
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,193
All of us, but brought us
back that same night.

1164
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,665
We don't remember
where they took us

1165
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,578
or what
they did to us.

1166
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:31,347
Even with hypnosis,
it's black.

1167
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:37,722
Your voice,
or its voice,

1168
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,452
said it was God.

1169
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:44,131
What do
you believe?

1170
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,598
I believe...

1171
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,366
It's hard,
but I believe

1172
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:52,532
the things I've seen,

1173
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,036
the presence I've felt

1174
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,377
inside of me

1175
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:03,841
is beyond anything
you can imagine.

1176
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:06,248
It was

1177
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,947
hopelessness,

1178
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:15,162
so it cannot be God,

1179
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,598
but it can...

1180
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,831
It can pretend to be.

1181
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,996
And what about Ashley?

1182
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:26,540
What about...

1183
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:27,700
And what about
your daughter?

1184
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,504
She...

1185
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,880
I had to recover
from that night.

1186
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:39,080
It took me a couple
of days to wake up.

1187
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:22,627
Abel...

1188
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,028
It's...

1189
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,130
It's okay.
It's okay.

1190
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:28,191
What is this?

1191
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:29,930
Look, I have
to apologize.

1192
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:31,761
I...

1193
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,476
I'm sorry, I really hate to
have to do this

1194
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:40,270
when you're in
this condition that you're in.

1195
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:45,641
It's okay.

1196
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,744
So,

1197
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:50,055
well, I still have that question for you,
Abbey.

1198
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,825
How did Will die?

1199
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,068
He was murdered.

1200
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,109
No, Abbey.

1201
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:15,244
Abbey, he's going to show you something
that will upset you,

1202
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:19,680
but it has to be done.

1203
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,220
Understand?

1204
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,889
This is the head
of a man

1205
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,732
who used this gun.

1206
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:43,369
Okay?

1207
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:52,216
Yeah. It was suicide,
Abbey. It was suicide.

1208
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:56,120
He took a pistol,
shot himself in the head.

1209
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:58,222
There was no intruder.

1210
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:03,092
There was no knife.
Just him with his pistol at the side of your bed.

1211
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,933
He's not that man.
He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that.

1212
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:11,802
He wouldn't do that to us. He wouldn't
do that to his family.

1213
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,507
Tell him he's wrong.
Tell him.

1214
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:24,780
I'm a psychologist, and I would have known...
Christ.

1215
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:28,915
I would have known
if he was gonna...

1216
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,418
Abbey, Abbey.

1217
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:32,755
You can't blame yourself

1218
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:35,660
for something that was
going on in his head.

1219
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:41,865
Who knows what he'd learned,
what he didn't share,

1220
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,268
and finally
what broke him?

1221
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,399
Now you know
the reality.

1222
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,076
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Tell me.

1223
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:58,686
What happened
to Ashley?

1224
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,918
Tell me. Abbey.

1225
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:10,126
You know what happened.
You experienced it.

1226
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:15,563
But we came back and she didn't.
Abel.

1227
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:22,202
Tell him.
Tell him what happened.

1228
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,852
Something took my daughter.

1229
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:42,125
I don't know what.
I don't... I don't know how.

1230
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:49,968
I don't know what it was,
but you have to believe me.

1231
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,304
You have to
believe me, please.

1232
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,238
Please.

1233
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,406
Please.

1234
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:02,039
It's difficult
to go back.

1235
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,547
Go back?

1236
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:11,047
Back over the line from
fiction to reality.

1237
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:19,060
You can't just stop being insane
whenever you want to.

1238
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:25,628
It's the kind of thing that stays
with you forever.

1239
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,902
So Will
committed suicide?

1240
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:35,740
Yes.

1241
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,554
Your credibility.
How do you expect me or the audience

1242
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,146
to believe
anything you're saying,

1243
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:44,157
if you actually
hallucinated

1244
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:45,749
the murder
of your husband?

1245
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,188
They weren't hallucinations.

1246
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:52,726
I just couldn't...

1247
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,063
It can be difficult
to face the truth,

1248
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:00,029
and with Will,

1249
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:03,772
that's how
I dealt with it.

1250
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,642
And no matter
what you believe,

1251
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:10,239
the recordings
do not lie.

1252
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:16,449
We were talking
about things that aren't normal.

1253
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:22,759
...is dead.
...back is broken.

1254
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:27,166
And Ashley,
she's still gone.

1255
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:31,972
These are hard facts.

1256
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,137
They do
appear to be.

1257
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:37,240
No, God damn it,
they are!

1258
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:41,871
You can sit here
and speculate,

1259
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:46,111
but I have to
keep hope alive.

1260
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:51,820
I have to believe
in what we're doing,

1261
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,953
my story,

1262
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:58,759
that it will help.

1263
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,895
I have to believe

1264
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:07,073
that she's still
alive somewhere,

1265
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,876
that she's safe.

1266
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:15,181
I have to believe
that there's a chance

1267
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:18,779
that I'm gonna
see her again,

1268
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:22,753
hold her again,

1269
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,149
hear her voice.

1270
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:33,560
I just want
my little girl back.

1271
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,597
She's all I have.

1272
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:44,834
Let's stop there.

1273
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,849
Dr. Tyler,

1274
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:56,513
we're done
for the night.

1275
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,124
Someone else is interested in Nome,
as well.

1276
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,496
Since the 1960s,
there have been

1277
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,559
over 2,000 visits
to Nome by the FBI,

1278
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:10,626
the highest in Alaska.

1279
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:12,036
Second is Anchorage,

1280
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:15,371
with a population
76 times larger than Nome.

1281
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:18,173
The FBI have paid them
353 visits.

1282
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,281
In the end, what you believe
is yours to decide.

1283
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:24,682
In the end, what you believe
is yours to decide.

1284
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:22,826
UFO Reporting Center.

1285
01:32:22,904 --> 01:32:24,565
Yeah, I got
a doozy for you.

1286
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,000
Okay.

1287
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:31,269
Gonna put me into the hospital,
I tell you that.

1288
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:33,304
What happened?

1289
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:34,678
I'm a truck driver.

1290
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:38,009
I had a load to Salt Lake City
from Banning.

1291
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:42,782
I pulled over, didn't...
I got out of the truck, kind of stretched.

1292
01:32:42,857 --> 01:32:44,848
I looked up
at the stars,

1293
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,052
and I saw
these two...

1294
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:49,153
There were quite a few of them
that were kind of low,

1295
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,664
and they were,
like, flickering.

1296
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:52,790
You know,
what could they be?

1297
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:55,700
And then it occurred to me, maybe
I'm seeing a UFO.

1298
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:58,136
Portland Air Traffic Control Tower
in Portland, Maine.

1299
01:32:58,205 --> 01:32:59,331
Yes, sir.

1300
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,170
I guess
I have a UFO report.

1301
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:05,645
What they drew, and these four people
pretty much agree that,

1302
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:09,410
actually, what they drew,
it looked like a fedora hat...

1303
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:12,782
I saw something
spectacular in the sky last night

1304
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:14,787
that I have no
explanation for.

1305
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:17,790
In fact, I'm sure as many as
50 to 100 people saw it

1306
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:19,689
in different areas
last night.

1307
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,424
I'm sure it had
as many as 20 pulsating red lights,

1308
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,466
one white light
in the front of it.

1309
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:28,900
Like I said, it was
about 100 feet from me.

1310
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:33,135
To me, it looked about,
like, something...

1311
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:38,344
Like I said, right... I remember seeing it,
but after that it just...

1312
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:42,006
I don't exactly
remember too much.

1313
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:45,018
I could see this very bright
red light,

1314
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:47,651
and it would change
to kind of a blue light,

1315
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:49,622
and the reflection
off the clouds.

1316
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,714
Yes?

1317
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,521
And I could also hear this very loud
buzzing noise.

1318
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:55,289
My daughter
is seven years old,

1319
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:58,355
and she said it was in
the shape of a square.

1320
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:02,326
She said she's seen four red lights
in the corner

1321
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:03,529
and a white one
in the middle.

1322
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:06,801
Okay. We had an aircraft
at 35, 000 feet westbound.

1323
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:10,975
They reported
sighting four objects.

1324
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:12,376
Three of them
were at his altitude

1325
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:14,073
and one of them
was a lot lower.

1326
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:17,049
We observed an unknown phenomenon
this morning,

1327
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:19,678
about 1600 Zulu,

1328
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:22,779
and we observed it
for about 10 to 15 minutes.

1329
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:25,124
The targets were approximately
200 miles

1330
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,490
west of San Francisco
over the water.

1331
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:29,893
They flew in what
appeared to be unison,

1332
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:32,296
approximately
90 miles apart.

1333
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:35,563
Their speed was
in excess of 2, 000 knots.

1334
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:39,636
They did a high-speed run
for about 75 miles,

1335
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,300
made a very
abrupt slowdown,

1336
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:44,241
and then
a 180-degree turn,

1337
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:45,778
and tracked back
northbound

1338
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:46,972
in excess
of 2, 000 knots.

1339
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:49,073
It had
fire-engine red lights,

1340
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,744
kelly green lights,
orange lights.

1341
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:55,346
It would shut all them lights down
and turn a bright white.

1342
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,482
It was zigzagging
in and out.

1343
01:34:57,558 --> 01:35:00,925
It was shooting from
one side of the sky to the other side.

1344
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:02,519
It was almost as
if it was rolling.

1345
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:05,690
After eight to
12 seconds of this boiling,

1346
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:07,958
we saw an object
come up out of the water

1347
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,230
and go straight
up into the air.

1348
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:14,570
It was a circular-shaped
object.

1349
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:15,631
To give you
a brief on it,

1350
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,440
I was dispatched
on a UFO sighting.

1351
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:23,413
When I arrived,
what I saw was a real large craft

1352
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:25,418
in the air, circular.

1353
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:28,419
I would say it was
at least 25 yards wide,

1354
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,582
or in diameter
actually, it would be,

1355
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:34,261
and it was hovering over a house,
and it was motionless.

1356
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,489
They're real bright,
like a star,

1357
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:39,624
and when it gets closer to you,
it gets dimmer.

1358
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:43,032
Then when it lands,
it goes into a big, big orange,

1359
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:45,928
kind of like looking at the sun
or something.

1360
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:47,132
Uh-huh.

1361
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,608
And then when
the light goes out,

1362
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:51,736
it's like you turned
down a kerosene lamp.

1363
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:52,801
What exactly
happened was,

1364
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,745
it was myself and a friend
were flying.

1365
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:56,680
I'm a commercial pilot.
- Yes.

1366
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:01,313
And we saw this object,
and it wasn't bright like a light.

1367
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:05,790
It was shining like
polished aluminum,

1368
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:07,623
or polished metal.
Yes.

1369
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,528
Like a point source
that was emanating

1370
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,396
several shafts
of black light.

1371
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:16,602
It was like
negative light.

1372
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:18,661
There's gotta be several hundred people
that saw it.

1373
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:21,503
We had an aircraft
that sighted a UFO.

1374
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:25,471
The pilot reported
an object passed

1375
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,743
approximately one eighth of a mile
in front of the aircraft.

1376
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:32,752
It was described
as being box-shaped.

1377
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:36,986
And as soon as I pulled over, this object
came straight at us,

1378
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:40,515
straight to our vehicle.
It was huge. This thing was huge.

1379
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:43,085
It was black, huge.
It had these triangle lights on it.

1380
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:45,632
I have never been a believer of UFOs
in my entire life,

1381
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:48,167
and I just seen a minimum of nine
this morning

1382
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:49,702
with my own eyes,

1383
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:52,264
and, I mean,
I am a believer.

1384
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:57,504
One orange, and at least
nine of the bright, bright moving lights.

1385
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,976
I was just staring at it,
stopped

1386
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:02,277
in my vehicle,
and it started to move,

1387
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:06,008
and it had lights down each side of it,
like a triangle.

1388
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:08,020
Yes?
And then, next thing I know,

1389
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:10,886
I didn't take my eyes off the damn thing.
It was gone.

1390
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:14,587
My little brother,
he's three, he'll be four next month,

1391
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,562
Iast night he started
talking to my parents,

1392
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:18,461
and I just got done
talking with him.

1393
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:20,625
He told my dad,
"You have to lock the door,

1394
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:22,601
"'cause the creatures
are gonna come get me,"

1395
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,865
and he said,
"The men in the stars,"

1396
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:26,736
he said,
"they're coming to get me."

1397
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:28,206
They follow him.
When he goes outside,

1398
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:29,936
he says,
"The star follows me.

1399
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,102
"The star follows me."

1400
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:32,805
You'd have to
experience this

1401
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,541
in order to believe me.

1402
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,552
I'm afraid to walk outside.
I need help.

1403
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:44,022
I don't know how to deal with this.
It's so strange.

1404
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,022
I'm frightened
to go to sleep.

1405
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,330
What if they come back?
