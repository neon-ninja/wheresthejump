Put some heat on that one.

24
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:20,038
Yeah, I guess
I missed my chance to go pro.

25
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,106
Oh!

26
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:56,721
Tell you what.

27
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,422
Right now, you could walk away

28
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,820
with a prize
from the second level,

29
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:04,088
or you could keep going for
a prize from the third level.

30
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,955
Okay.
What do you think, Addy?

31
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:08,755
Should we stop or keep going?

32
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,787
Don't look at me.
It's your birthday.

33
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:15,787
I want number 11.

34
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,754
- Yeah?
- That one?

35
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,455
- Yeah.
- All right.

36
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,091
Uh, yeah, uh, that one.

37
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,956
- Thanks, man.
- Of course.

38
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:30,521
Yeah.

39
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:33,522
That shirt better not
give her nightmares.

40
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:36,754
In trouble for winning
my daughter a T-shirt.

41
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:38,687
That's a new one.

42
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,455
She was terrified
when it came on TV.

43
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,122
You'd know that
if you were around, right?

44
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:45,454
Who let her watch it?

45
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,489
You know...

46
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:52,488
you know, they're filming
something by the carousel.

47
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,521
You should see if
they're looking for extras.

48
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:56,121
Uh... I need another beer.

49
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:04,955
I can't have a beer now?

50
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:08,521
Hey. How about the Big Dipper?

51
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:10,688
Addy, you want to try it?

52
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,920
Russel, you know she's
not big enough to do that.

53
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:15,020
And I sure as hell
am not doing it, so...

54
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,121
Whac-A-Mole!

55
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:23,122
Yeah, Whac-A-Mole, guy.

56
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:25,620
- That's what I'm talking about.
- How many tickets?

57
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:28,688
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets!

58
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,154
Two tickets!

59
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,155
Hey, Addy,
come to the bathroom.

60
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:34,653
I don't have to go.

61
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:41,054
Russel?

62
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:44,121
Russel! Can you watch
your daughter, please?

63
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,857
I'm watching.

64
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,389
Baby, stay close, okay?

65
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,587
- Glen.
- What?

66
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,720
- Stop it.
- I'm not doing anything.

67
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,088
You keep doing scissors.

68
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,688
Ah, I'm just cruising.

69
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,455
Come on.

70
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:13,020
Um, what?

71
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,821
- This is ridiculous.
- It's too rad.

72
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:16,488
Two knots. Come on, now.

73
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,820
What?

74
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:20,788
- This is... this is impossible.
- Oh, my God.

75
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,823
Don't do it. Don't do it.

76
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:36,720
<i>These, the earth and water,</i>

77
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:40,554
<i>he divided into places
from which life could spring.</i>

78
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:42,721
<i>The mountains and the valleys</i>

79
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:46,820
<i>and the waters
were all where they should be.</i>

80
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,020
<i>Then Sotuknang went to Taiowa
and said,</i>

81
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,721
<i>"I want you to see
what I have done.</i>

82
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:56,587
<i>And I have done well."</i>

83
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:59,154
<i>And Taiowa looked and said,</i>

84
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,054
<i>"It is very good.</i>

85
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:03,820
<i>"But you are not done with it.</i>

86
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,921
<i>"Now you must create life
of all kinds</i>

87
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:10,057
<i>and set it in motion
according to my plan."</i>

88
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:17,520
<i>...and went
into the endless space</i>

89
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,920
<i>and gathered substance
to create his helper,</i>

90
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,987
<i>the Spider Woman.</i>

91
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:25,620
<i>"Look all about you,
Spider Woman," said Sotuknang.</i>

92
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:27,887
<i>"Here now is endless space,</i>

93
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,788
<i>"but in the world,
there is no joyful movement.</i>

94
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,121
<i>The world needs..."</i>

95
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,554
We made it!

96
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:41,520
- Why?! Why?!
- No, Dad!

97
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:44,021
- 'Cause y'all sleep too much.
- All right.

98
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,488
Come on. Let's go.

99
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,755
Careful. Hey, hey, hey!

100
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,553
- Ah, whatever.
- Bags in the house first.

101
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:52,121
Look, look, look, look, look.

102
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:53,987
- Ew.
- Come on.

103
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,587
You're too old.

104
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,820
- You know the drill.
- Don't judge me.

105
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:59,954
Don't judge me.

106
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:01,888
- Little dude.
- The Wi-Fi's not working.

107
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,654
You don't need the Internet.
You got the Outernet.

108
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:05,921
Good one.

109
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:07,621
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

110
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:08,987
Knock-knock.

111
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,821
- Who's there?
- You.

112
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,955
You who?

113
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,453
Yoo-hoo.

114
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:14,721
Open up the door.

115
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,788
My God, what's wrong with you?

116
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,821
- Can we get a dog?
- No, we can't.

117
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:21,387
You should run
while you're here.

118
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:22,520
Jason, eat something.

119
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:23,987
- Something.
- What?

120
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:25,720
- What's with all the attitude?
- For me.

121
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,820
I'm sorry.

122
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:28,654
Yay, track and field.

123
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,988
Whoa. You don't want
to run anymore?

124
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,688
You love track and field.

125
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,554
- Well, what's the point?
- The Olympics.

126
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,154
I'm not gonna make it
to the Olympics, guys.

127
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:39,587
You could do anything
you set your mind to.

128
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:40,854
Can I drive
while we're up here?

129
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,388
- No.
- No.

130
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,721
Well, that's what
I set my mind to.

131
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,488
- You know...
- Where you going, Jason?

132
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,820
- Jason?
- Well, Cara and Haley...

133
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,053
Yeah, I'm gonna get something.

134
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,588
You need to come
and finish your food.

135
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,988
Cara and Haley drove
with parent supervision.

136
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,721
Yeah, well,
you don't need to know

137
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:54,921
how to drive when you're
an Olympic-caliber athlete.

138
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:56,554
- Oh, my God.
- You run.

139
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:58,921
- You run on the sand.
- Why?

140
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,420
Because it's harder, okay?

141
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:02,921
- No traction.
- Mm.

142
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:04,988
Practice on the beach,
you get on dry land,

143
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,053
you take off.

144
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,653
We're going to the beach?

145
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,588
Yeah. Well, later.

146
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,388
Once we get settled.

147
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,121
- What beach?
- Santa Cruz.

148
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:16,453
Josh, Kitty and the girls
are gonna be there.

149
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:24,420
What are you doing?

150
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:25,688
It's a magic trick.

151
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,653
I left it here last year.

152
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:28,790
Okay. Let's see it.

153
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,086
This thing's kind of bullshit.

154
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:40,688
Hey. What, are we cursing
at the table now?

155
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,421
When you point a finger
at someone else,

156
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,791
you have three pointing
back at you.

157
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:49,920
What is that supposed to mean?

158
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,588
It's four fingers
pointing back at you.

159
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,920
What are you talking...?

160
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:55,653
Look. See?

161
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:57,820
One's a thumb,
and it's not pointing at you.

162
00:14:57,822 --> 00:14:59,621
<i>So, what is it?</i>

163
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,387
I think she has
post-traumatic stress disorder.

164
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:05,754
She wasn't in 'Nam.

165
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:08,855
Okay? She got lost.
For 15 minutes. That's...

166
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:10,720
That can be very scary.

167
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:12,554
No, you don't know
what happened to her.

168
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,986
Anything could've
happened to her.

169
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:17,787
Okay, so... so how-how do we
get her to talk?

170
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:20,053
Look, I think
we need to encourage her

171
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:22,920
to draw, to write, to dance.

172
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,987
Anything to help her
tell us her story.

173
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,356
I just want
my little girl back.

174
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,891
It's gonna be okay.

175
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:48,488
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

176
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,788
- Is...
- I'm... I'm gonna...

177
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,857
I need to have a smoke.

178
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,620
I don't get
why we have a summer home

179
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,488
by the beach

180
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,787
and don't go to the beach.

181
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,053
What about the beach
right here?

182
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,954
- What beach?
- There's a beach right there.

183
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,521
That is not a beach.

184
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:41,120
That is a bay.
That is a shore.

185
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,054
I'm talking about a real beach,

186
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:45,487
with people and sand,
amusement park.

187
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,687
There's, like...
It's crowded there.

188
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,688
- Oh, come...
- And, like, there's weirdos

189
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,987
at that beach and...
I-I'm not going to that beach.

190
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:55,421
- We're not going.
- Okay.

191
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,421
I guess I'll just cancel, then.

192
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:59,053
Okay.

193
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:01,653
It just sucks, is all.

194
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,755
I mean...

195
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,454
I know Jason really was
looking forward to it.

196
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:07,987
This is the first summer

197
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,953
we've been back here
since Grandma died.

198
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,886
I know it's been
pretty hard on him.

199
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,019
We leave before dark.

200
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,488
Yeah.

201
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,787
Yes. Yes.

202
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,587
It's gonna be great.

203
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,587
- And you're gonna enjoy it.
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,819
Mm-hmm.

205
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:28,053
Mm-hmm.

206
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:29,920
Are you really not
gonna kiss me?

207
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:30,953
Mm-mm.

208
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:34,120
You're not gonna kiss me?

209
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:37,387
Hmm? Mm...

210
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:43,986
Where's your brother?

211
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:45,787
Your brother... where is he?

212
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,787
I don't know.

213
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,424
Really?

214
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,657
Jason?

215
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,754
Jason?

216
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:28,554
Baby, that's why
you can't play in here.

217
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:31,686
- Didn't this happen last year?
- Zora, please.

218
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:45,153
Yeah!

219
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:48,120
That's right.
What do you think?!

220
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:51,553
Daddy is home, baby!

221
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:55,121
Craw Daddy!

222
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,919
- He's kidding, right?
- He is not kidding.

223
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,421
Got a cassette player
and everything.

224
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:04,387
Leather seats!

225
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,121
Glove compartment!

226
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:09,653
- Wow.
- That's right.

227
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:12,554
It's even got
one of these, baby!

228
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,056
Oh, I got it, I got it.
Guy taught me how to do this.

229
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,656
It veers a little to the left,
so you got to hold on to it.

230
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:32,754
Least I got it really cheap.

231
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:35,086
- Will we all fit, though?
- You know what?

232
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:37,087
Y'all are spoiled.

233
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,689
Spoiled.

234
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,053
Did you know that there's
fluoride in the water

235
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:00,357
that the government uses
to control our minds?

236
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,923
I forgot. Nobody cares about
the end of the world.

237
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:15,521
Maybe you could just tell us
what's supposed to happen,

238
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:17,454
and then we can picture it.

239
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,720
Maybe you can
kiss my anus, Zora.

240
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:22,520
- Ew!
- Whoa, whoa! - What?

241
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:23,652
"Anus" isn't a cuss word.

242
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:25,087
Why are we even talking
about anuses?

243
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:27,120
- Why would you say that?
- I would have

244
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:30,554
actually preferred you use
a curse word in this case.

245
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,719
Mom, I can see you laughing.

246
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:35,521
- I am not laughing.
- Where'd you even learn that?

247
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:37,753

have to be talking.

Where's the efficiency, man?

00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,686
- Hey. Look at you.
- Oh, my God, look at you.

293
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:23,153
- Yes.
- Welcome to paradise.

294
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:24,987
- Of course, man. - Hey.
- You look so pretty!

295
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:26,021
- Hi. How are you?
- Thank you.

296
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:27,120
Oh, the girls are gonna be
so happy to see you.

297
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:29,419
Uh, what do you want?
I can get some beer for you.

298
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:30,587
- Becca! Lindsey! Look who's here!
- No.

299
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,819
- No?
- The answer is no.

300
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,121
- Please.
- He's old enough.

301
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:34,652
- In a couple more years.
- Don't hawk her.

302
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:37,020
- All right, all right.
- Hi.

303
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:38,787
- No shit. You got the boat?
- Yep, I got the boat.

304
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:39,953
- Good for you, dude.
- Boom.

305
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:41,553
That's fucking awesome.
What'd you get?

306
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:43,519
- A dinghy? You get, like...
- Oh, shut up.

307
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:45,453
You got to make sure
you have the essentials.

308
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:47,087
- You got the life preservers?
- Got that.

309
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,819
- You got a fire extinguisher?
- Got that.

310
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,687
Do you have a flare gun?

311
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,687
I knew you'd fucking forget the flare gun.

312
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:56,786
We got to get out there
and do a double excursion.

313
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,154
We're right across the bay
from you guys, for fuck's sake.

314
00:24:59,156 --> 00:25:00,854
Sure you don't want
anything to drink?

315
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:03,419
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- This rosé is delicious.

316
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:06,523
Mm-hmm. I'm sure, yeah.

317
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:10,087
Did you guys have
a good summer so far?

318
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,920
Yeah, it's been great.

319
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:14,687
No, a little bit small,
but a classic design, you know?

320
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:15,853
You good?

321
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:17,919
Yeah.

322
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,355
What?

323
00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:22,719
I have a hard time just...

324
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,786
you know, talking.

325
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:26,552
Oh, I get that.

326
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:28,886
Yeah, no, I totally get that.

327
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:30,987
You guys, uh, want something?

328
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,719
Got a full bar here.

329
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:34,986
No. All good. Water.

330
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:36,587
You want thirds, huh?

331
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:39,086
- Thank you.
- Okay.

332
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:41,452
I'm gonna get my wife
her medicine.

333
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,919
That's beautiful, isn't it?

334
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,154
Here you go.

335
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:45,587
- Just... - Mm, yeah.
- Ah, ah.

336
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:47,686
What do we say?

337
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:48,886
I hate you?

338
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:50,121
- That works.
- Yeah?

339
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:52,754
- Yeah.
- Good.

340
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:54,887
Never stops.

341
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:57,120
I think about
murdering him sometimes.

342
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,719
- So nothing's changed, huh?
- Nope.

343
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:03,789
Oh, actually,
a little something has changed.

344
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,753
Oh, my God.

345
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:09,586
Did you get something done?

346
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:11,486
Just, like, an itsy-bitsy,
little... a little thing.

347
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,786
- Oh, fuck off.
- Yeah.

348
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,587
Well, you look just like
you did last year.

349
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:16,854
Aw, thank you.

350
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:18,487
I mean, that's the idea,
you know.

351
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,919
- Just, like, a little bit can go a long way.
- Mm.

352
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:24,020
Not that you need
anything, whore.

353
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:36,886
- Oh, man.
- Oops.

354
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,786
What was it?

355
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:41,919
Just a stupid tunnel.
That's all.

356
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:44,656
Ugh.
Beach toys are such baby shit.

357
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,753
Your brother's so weird.

358
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:56,889
He just has
a hard time focusing.

359
00:26:58,822 --> 00:27:01,387
Are you going in the water?

360
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:03,552
- No.
- Why not?

361
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,953
Yeah, why not?

362
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,121
- Hey, where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

363
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:09,486
Why don't you pee in the ocean?

364
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,387
Jinx. Double jinx.

365
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:13,053
Triple jinx. Blackout.

366
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:15,620
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

367
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:17,690
Do you ever wish
you kept dancing?

368
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:21,486
Sometimes, yeah.

369
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:23,987
'Cause you were, like,
you were really good, right?

370
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:25,787
Yeah, well...

371
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:27,519
I peaked at 14.

372
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,053
Oh, I mean, didn't we all?

373
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:42,920
I think I could have been
a movie star

374
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:46,620
if the girls hadn't been born
at exactly the wrong time.

375
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:49,087
I went to Stella Adler,

376
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:52,587
and I booked two commercials
before I met Josh.

377
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:53,787
It's just, I stopped auditioning

378
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:54,854
when I got pregnant.

379
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:55,921
Then the move to San Francisco

380
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,587
was a career killer, and...

381
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,653
I was supposed to keep flying
back to L.A.

382
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:04,487
It's just...

383
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:05,722
Jesus. Watch it.

384
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:10,753
Ugh. That's crazy.

385
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,522
Been having so many
crazy coincidences lately.

386
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:35,922
Yeah, that's what he said.

387
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,787
- Anyways, we should go back to our place.
- Sure.

388
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,652
- I think it's vodka o'clock.
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

389
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,419
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, good. Let's pack up.

390
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:05,887
Okay.

391
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,886
Where's Jason?

392
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:11,054
Mm...

393
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:13,786
Jason. Where's Jason?

394
00:29:13,788 --> 00:29:15,587
Gabe.

395
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,619
Where's Jason?

396
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:19,487
Jason?

397
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:22,556
Jason?

398
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,555
- Jason?
- Jason!

399
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:29,790
- Jason?
- Jason!

400
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,653
- Where were you?
- I was in the bath...

401
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:37,520
No! You don't do that.

402
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:39,120
You don't run off
without telling me.

403
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:40,886
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

404
00:29:40,888 --> 00:29:42,652
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, we're good.

405
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:45,456
- We're good. All right.
- You don't do that to me.

406
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:49,452
- Understand?
- Sorry.

407
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,854
I'm gonna get ready to go.

408
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,486
- Okay?
- I think we're gonna head out.

409
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:53,853
- Yeah.
- Okay?

410
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:55,919
- No worries.
- Yeah, we're...

411
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:58,819
<i>The Houston
Astros were essentially short</i>

412
00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:01,553
<i>one everyday player
heading into the season.</i>

413
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:02,887
<i>No incumbent...</i>

414
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,954
You saw their new car, right?

415
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:06,686
He had to do it.

416
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:09,420
He just had to get that thing
to fuck with me, too.

417
00:30:09,422 --> 00:30:10,887
I guess mission accomplished.

418
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:13,419
Don't run inside.

419
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:22,120
Way to freak Mom out.

420
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,686
<i>And here's something you don't</i>

421
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,686
<i>see every day:
extra innings in Minnesota.</i>

422
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:26,953
I'm gonna go say good night.

423
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:29,886
<i>11-11,
tied in the seventh inning.</i>

424
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,786
<i>Yeah, you see, Hollister, known
for his late-inning fastball,</i>

425
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,453
<i>comes in at a cool...</i>

426
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:36,452
You good?

427
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:40,486
I'm just gonna watch
the Giants highlights, okay?

428
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:44,520
I'll see you later
in the magic room.

429
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:46,119
Night-night.

430
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:49,018
- Good night.
- Phone off.

431
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:11,022
Mask off.

432
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,120
You thought I was dead?

433
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:20,419
Um, no. Uh, I just...

434
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:24,119
I just didn't know
if you were lost or...

435
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:26,620
taken or...

436
00:31:26,622 --> 00:31:28,919
By terrorists and perverts?

437
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:37,389
Stick with me,
and I'll keep you safe, okay?

438
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:49,356
Look.

439
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,423
11:11.

440
00:31:59,455 --> 00:32:00,889
Bedtime.

441
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,556
Who's this?

442
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,687
<i>You know, I was thinking about</i>

443
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,619
getting some fishing gear
tomorrow.

444
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:43,786
Four rods, we can all
go fish off the dock.

445
00:32:43,788 --> 00:32:46,553
You know?

446
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:48,755
Of course,
there's the boat, too.

447
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:56,152
I'm just saying, if we could
get out there in open water...

448
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:59,488
I'm not trying to force anyone.

449
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:22,422
Hey.

450
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:26,387
Gabe, I want to go.

451
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:28,520
Where you trying to go?

452
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,620
I can't be here. I...

453
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:33,786
It's too much.

454
00:33:33,788 --> 00:33:35,486
You serious?

455
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,885
Being here, it, um...

456
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:40,420
Hmm.

457
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:42,754
It feels like...

458
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:44,389
there's this, um...

459
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:50,553
...black cloud
just hanging over me,

460
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:53,152
and, uh...

461
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:56,619
I don't feel like myself.

462
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:58,988
I think you look like yourself.

463
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:08,356
Okay. Yeah.

464
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,720
When I was a kid,

465
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:29,756
I went to that boardwalk
with my parents.

466
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:33,486
<i>I wandered off.</i>

467
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,985
<i>I don't know why. I just did.</i>

468
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:38,556
<i>I ended up
in that hall of mirrors.</i>

469
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:43,022
<i>There was another girl
in there.</i>

470
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:48,620
<i>She looked like me.</i>

471
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:51,786
<i>Exactly like me.</i>

472
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,687
But you were in
the hall of mirrors...

473
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:55,885
She wasn't a reflection.

474
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,954
She was real.

475
00:35:00,421 --> 00:35:03,018
She was real.

476
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,553
She...

477
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:14,855
I ran as fast as I could.

478
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:21,921
My whole life, I've...

479
00:35:25,554 --> 00:35:29,888
I've felt like
she's still coming for me.

480
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:32,785
Okay, well, whatever happened,

481
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:35,655
happened a-a long time ago,
right?

482
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:40,886
You know how sometimes
things line up?

483
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,652
- Yeah.
- You know, like coincidences.

484
00:35:43,654 --> 00:35:45,586
Since we've been here,

485
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:48,689
they've been happening
more and more.

486
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:54,519
I think...
I feel like it means,

487
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,754
like, she's getting closer.

488
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,855
Who? The mirror girl?

489
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:05,452
You don't believe me.

490
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,818
I-I... I-I do.

491
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,420
I do.

492
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:11,586
I'm-I'm processing. Okay?

493
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,819
I just...

494
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:19,818
can't believe you kept
all this inside for so long.

495
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,387
Come on.

496
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,452
You know I'm here, right?

497
00:36:23,454 --> 00:36:25,387
I'm pretty sure
I could kick your ass,

498
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:28,552
so if she looks like you,
then...

499
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,786
Okay. Bad joke.

500
00:36:33,788 --> 00:36:35,419
All right.

501
00:36:35,421 --> 00:36:37,520
I'm sorry. My bad.

502
00:36:37,522 --> 00:36:39,520
I'm just trying
to lighten the mood.

503
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:42,786
Oh, shit.

504
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:45,419
We lost power.
Perfect timing.

505
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:48,052
See, this is why Josh has
a backup generator.

506
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:50,953
God! Hell!

507
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,752
Jesus!

508
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,786
Okay, we lost power.
Go back to bed.

509
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:57,453
There's a family
in our driveway.

510
00:36:57,455 --> 00:37:01,718
What? There is not a family
in our driveway.

511
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:08,152
Huh. Who is that?

512
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:09,818
Uh-uh.

513
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,753
Oh, it is a family.

514
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:13,489
What, y'all scared of a family?

515
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:16,452
A bogeyman's family.

516
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:18,719
Okay, all right.
Enough... enough of that.

517
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:19,953
No. Uh-uh.

518
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,619
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Uh-uh.

519
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:23,986
What?

520
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:25,452
Zora, give me your phone.

521
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,651
- I'm not on it.
- Zora!

522
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:28,387
Sorry.

523
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:29,786
Is there someone outside?

524
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:32,786
It's just a family
standing outside.

525
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:35,852
It's probably the neighbors.

526
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:36,686
You're kidding me, right?

527
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,919
- Hello.
- I'm scared.

528
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,452
My name is Adelaide Wilson.

529
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:40,818
Are you seriously
calling 911 right now?

530
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,152
We're at 2311 Seagull Way. Shh!

531
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:43,786
Everything's good.
We lost power.

532
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:45,419
There are four trespassers
on our property.

533
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:46,685
- All right, sure, okay.
- Yes.

534
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:48,085
- You know what?
- What?

535
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:50,420
- I'm gonna fix this.
- No, we don't.

536
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:52,086
- I'm gonna find out who they are...
- What?

537
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:53,952
No, they haven't,
but I know they will.

538
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:55,785
...find out what they want,
and everything's gonna be fine.

539
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:57,552
- Gabe.
- Calm down, okay?

540
00:37:57,554 --> 00:37:59,085
15 minutes?
No, no, no, that's too long.

541
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:00,619
Oh, boy.

542
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:02,420
No, you don't,
you don't understand. We...

543
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:04,785
How about we all just try
to keep calm...

544
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:06,651
- Gabe. - Dad.
- ...keep our heads,

545
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:08,085
and everything's gonna
be all right.

546
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,818
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

547
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,818
Just one sec... Gabe.

548
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:21,052
Trying to have a vacation,

549
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:24,119
and my whole family lost
they goddamn minds.

550
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,618
Hi.

551
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,622
Can I help you?

552
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:38,985
Okay.

553
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:42,152
If y'all are out here
trying to scare people,

554
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,988
I think you picked
the wrong house for that.

555
00:38:48,888 --> 00:38:50,886
Zora...

556
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:52,822
put your shoes on.

557
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:59,585
I... I asked you nice.

558
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,854
Now I need y'all
to get off my property.

559
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,089
Okay.

560
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,485
Okay, let's call the cops.

561
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:36,952
I did.
They're 14 minutes away.

562
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:39,485
What? 14 minutes?

563
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,752
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

564
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:44,551
Okay, okay.

565
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:47,085
- Jason, give me the bat.
- What bat?

566
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:48,786
The baseball bat. The bat.

567
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:50,518
- There's one in the cl...
- Here, here.

568
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,586
- Thank you.
- Gabe?

569
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:52,885
All right, hold on.

570
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:54,519
I got this.
Let's try this again.

571
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:57,752
- Gabe?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

572
00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:59,685
All right.

573
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:02,454
- Gabe!
- I got this. I got this.

574
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,786
Now, I thought
I already done told y'all

575
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:10,853
to get off my property.

576
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:15,852
Okay? So, if y'all want to
get crazy, we can get crazy.

577
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:20,322
Now, the cops are
already on they way.

578
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:27,818
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,055
Hey!

580
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:37,518
Oh!

581
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,954
Sh...

582
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,551
They're going around.

583
00:40:44,553 --> 00:40:46,019
Is the back door locked?

584
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:48,387
- My window's open.
- Gabe... Zora, no!

585
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:50,120
Gabe, Jason!

586
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:06,485
Yo, I'm serious, man!

587
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:08,585
I will break your head!

588
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:10,487
If I were you...

589
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:19,019
Gabe.

590
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:55,719
- The key.
- What key?

591
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,522
- The damn hide-a-key.
- Hide-a-key?

592
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,921
What kind of white shit...?

593
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:10,552
Oh, shit.

594
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:53,585
- Mom?
- Just stay close.

595
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,686
What's going on?

596
00:44:44,788 --> 00:44:46,385
What?

597
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:48,718
It's us.

598
00:44:58,688 --> 00:45:00,652
We don't have anything here.

599
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:02,586
This is our summer home.

600
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:04,885
- Gabe.
- We just got in today, so...

601
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:07,019
Once...

602
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:08,655
upon...

603
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:13,989
...a t-ime...

604
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:20,086
...there was a girl.

605
00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:24,151
And the girl had...

606
00:45:24,153 --> 00:45:26,089
a sh-adow.

607
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:34,551
The two were connected,

608
00:45:34,553 --> 00:45:36,918
tethered together.

609
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,019
When the girl ate,

610
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:43,019
her food was given to her

611
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:46,018
warm and tasty.

612
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,686
But when the shadow was hungry,

613
00:45:49,688 --> 00:45:51,686
she had to eat rabbit,

614
00:45:51,688 --> 00:45:55,452
raw and bloody.

615
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:58,019
On Christmas,

616
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,886
the girl received
wonderful toys,

617
00:46:01,888 --> 00:46:05,085
soft and cushy.

618
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:09,385
But the shadow's toys
were so sharp and cold,

619
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:11,485
they'd slice
through her fingers

620
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:14,053
when she tried
to play with them.

621
00:46:14,055 --> 00:46:18,818
The girl met a handsome prince

622
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,818
and fell in love,

623
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,786
but the shadow,
at that same time,

624
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:27,985
met Abraham.

625
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:32,953
It didn't matter
if she loved him or not.

626
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:37,051
He was tethered to
the girl's prince, after all.

627
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:42,419
Then the girl had
her first child,

628
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:44,718
a beautiful baby girl.

629
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,085
But the shadow,

630
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:50,919
she gave birth
to a little monster.

631
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:54,918
Umbrae was born laughing.

632
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,152
The girl had a second child,
a boy this time.

633
00:46:59,154 --> 00:47:04,486
They had to cut her open
and take him from her belly.

634
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,685
The shadow had to do it all...

635
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:11,552
herself.

636
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:13,017
She named him Pluto.

637
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:16,818
He was born to love fire.

638
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,685
So, you see,
the shadow hated the girl

639
00:47:21,687 --> 00:47:25,152
so much for so long,

640
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:30,118
until one day
the shadow realized

641
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:35,321
she was being tested by God.

642
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:42,521
Excuse me.

643
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:45,854
Excuse me.

644
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,852
What do you want?

645
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:51,952
You could have my wallet.

646
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,785
You-you could have the car.

647
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,518
Gabe.

648
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,455
Yeah.

649
00:47:59,986 --> 00:48:02,551
You can have the boat,
for all I care.

650
00:48:02,553 --> 00:48:05,786
Nobody wants the boat, Dad.

651
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:07,552
How about this?

652
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,552
You take me to the ATM...

653
00:48:19,154 --> 00:48:21,388
What are you people?

654
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:29,354
We're Americans.

655
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:43,552
Tether yourself to the table.

656
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,552
Addy, don't do it.

657
00:48:47,554 --> 00:48:49,385
Maybe I should cut...

658
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:51,421
something off of you.

659
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,354
It's... it's okay.

660
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,055
Just...

661
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:23,722
Don't hurt my children.

662
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:48,385
Yo.

663
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:06,917
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Get your hands off me.

664
00:50:06,919 --> 00:50:08,385
- No. Gabe, no.
- No, wait, no. Dad!

665
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:09,885
Wait. Wait.

666
00:50:09,887 --> 00:50:11,451
Get off me, man.

667
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:13,118
Look, Gabe...

668
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,652
Wait. Gabe.

669
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:17,786
Oh, please,
please, please stop!

670
00:50:17,788 --> 00:50:19,418
- Stop, please!
- Gabe.

671
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:22,819
Stop, stop. Wait. Wait.

672
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:25,785
Wai... Please!

673
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,118
Okay. Okay.

674
00:50:36,086 --> 00:50:38,789
- Mom.
- Little girl.

675
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,888
Run!

676
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:45,754
Go.

677
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:17,552
You want me, right?

678
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,818
No.

679
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,052
- He's not going.
- Careful.

680
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:31,652
He has a t-emper.

681
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,885
No, no, no, no, no, no,

682
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,587
no, no, no, not that shit.

683
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:09,984
No. No.

684
00:52:09,986 --> 00:52:11,921
Okay.

685
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,017
- I'm scared.
- Look...

686
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:16,751
Look at me.

687
00:52:16,753 --> 00:52:19,054
You're gonna be okay.

688
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:26,552
Show him one of your tricks.

689
00:52:26,554 --> 00:52:28,419
Okay.

690
00:52:30,753 --> 00:52:32,452
Go play, boys.

691
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:40,818
Don't burn our house down.

692
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:06,151
Stop, man.

693
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:07,917
Please stop.

694
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:10,088
No, no, stop, stop, stop.

695
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:13,619
Please.

696
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:15,485
Come on, man, stop.

697
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:17,151
Stop it.

698
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,051
I got a family, man.
Please don't. No.

699
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:39,954
What the fuck?

700
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,954
Get off my car!

701
00:55:47,787 --> 00:55:50,785
Are you...?
Come here. Come...

702
00:55:50,787 --> 00:55:53,055
Goddamn it,
get your ass over here.

703
00:55:58,387 --> 00:56:00,851
I said, "Come here."

704
00:56:00,853 --> 00:56:02,550
Kid, I'm talking to you.

705
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,653
What do you want?

706
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,820
What?

707
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,321
What do we want?

708
00:56:33,388 --> 00:56:35,550
We want...

709
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:37,987
to take our t-ime.

710
00:56:39,653 --> 00:56:43,018
We've been waiting for this day

711
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,654
for so long.

712
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,951
I call it...

713
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:53,721
"The Untethering."

714
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,518
That's yours.

715
01:00:51,653 --> 01:00:53,785
It hangs to the left.

716
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:55,988
It hangs to the goddamn left.

717
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:29,720
Jason.

718
01:02:49,453 --> 01:02:51,817
Jason.

719
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:55,884
Baby.

720
01:02:55,886 --> 01:02:57,518
Come on. Come on.

721
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,852
Let's go.

722
01:03:07,054 --> 01:03:08,784
Keys.

723
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:15,717
- Mom! Mom!
- Zora!

724
01:03:19,387 --> 01:03:21,050
This way. Come on!

725
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:22,620
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go!

726
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,117
Hey!

727
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,684
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on,

728
01:03:37,686 --> 01:03:40,451
come on, come on, come on.

729
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,718
Oh. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

730
01:04:30,486 --> 01:04:33,684
- Josh? What was that?
- What?

731
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:35,584
I heard something outside.

732
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:38,451
Okay.

733
01:04:38,453 --> 01:04:40,685
A rustling.
Walking, like a person.

734
01:04:40,687 --> 01:04:42,951
There's a person walking around
outside our fucking house.

735
01:04:42,953 --> 01:04:44,952
It's probably a squirrel.
I don't know.

736
01:04:44,954 --> 01:04:46,688
Would you please get up
and look?

737
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:50,785
I'm busy.
I'm... I'm busy.

738
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:52,354
So...

739
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:57,751
Maybe it's a-a pizza guy.
Maybe the girls ordered pizza.

740
01:04:57,753 --> 01:05:00,150
Get up and take a look.
I'm scared.

741
01:05:00,152 --> 01:05:01,983
Oh, I don't want to.
I want to stay down here.

742
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,685
I want to just stay
in my cozy spot.

743
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:05,417
- Get up and look.
- Jesus Christ.

744
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:07,384
Hey, uh, Ophelia, lights up.

745
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:09,585
Turning lights up.

746
01:05:09,587 --> 01:05:12,017
I feel like I heard the
backup generator go on, too.

747
01:05:12,019 --> 01:05:13,918
What do you know
about the backup generator?

748
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,951
Can you stop being
an asshole for two seconds?

749
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:18,051
- Just look.
- All right. I'm looking.

750
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:19,852
I'll get my binoculars.

751
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:22,751
I see nothing.
I see beautiful stars.

752
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:24,418
Are you really looking?

753
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,550
Yeah, I'm looking.

754
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:28,618
Oh, shit.
No, yeah, I...

755
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,551
- There's something out there.
- Don't fuck with me, Josh.

756
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:32,017
I'm not fucking with you.
I'm serious.

757
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:33,385
There's something out there.
Look.

758
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,017
Look behind the car.

759
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:37,017
- Where? I don't see it.
- It's by the car.

760
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:38,550
- Look.
- I can't...

761
01:05:38,552 --> 01:05:40,050
- Oh, shit.
- What?

762
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:42,751
Oh, my God, it's O.J.

763
01:05:42,753 --> 01:05:45,983
It's O.J. Simpson.

764
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:48,685
What is wrong with you?
Seriously.

765
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:51,450
Ophelia,
give me some Beach Boys.

766
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:52,618
Playing "Good Vibrations"

767
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,784
- by the Beach Boys.
- Really? - Why not?

768
01:05:53,786 --> 01:05:55,684
It's our last night here.

769
01:05:55,686 --> 01:05:57,517
- Let's have a little party.
- Ophelia, turn it down.

770
01:05:57,519 --> 01:05:59,151
Turning down "Good
Vibrations" by the Beach Boys.

771
01:05:59,153 --> 01:06:01,051
Would you chill out, all right?
There's nobody out there.

772
01:06:01,053 --> 01:06:03,051
Just go back upstairs.
I'll be up in a few minutes.

773
01:06:03,053 --> 01:06:04,651
Everything's gonna be fine.

774
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:06,617
What's going on?

775
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:08,151
Uh, nothing.

776
01:06:08,153 --> 01:06:09,550
- Nothing, guys.
- Jesus.

777
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:10,883
The backup generator went on.

778
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,618
We're just trying
to figure it out.

779
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,618
- Go back to sleep.
- Just because we're in our rooms

780
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,050
doesn't mean we're sleeping.

781
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:17,884
Fine. I don't know.
Go back to your rooms.

782
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:19,484
Guys, we have to be out of here

783
01:06:19,486 --> 01:06:20,884
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
sharp, so...

784
01:06:22,686 --> 01:06:24,684
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.

785
01:06:26,985 --> 01:06:28,785
Josh!

786
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:46,618
Please stop.

787
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:50,451
Stopping "Good
Vibrations" by the Beach Boys.

788
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:55,453
Ophelia...

789
01:07:57,786 --> 01:07:59,916
Ophelia, call the police.

790
01:07:59,918 --> 01:08:01,384
Sure.

791
01:08:01,386 --> 01:08:03,984
Playing "Fuck tha Police"
by N.W.A.

792
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,550
Josh, we need your help.

793
01:08:28,419 --> 01:08:30,751
Addy!

794
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:35,983
Addy!

795
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:38,117
No!

796
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:40,685
No! No! No! No!

797
01:08:42,587 --> 01:08:44,853
Go, go, go, go, go, go. Run.

798
01:08:57,786 --> 01:08:59,750
Come here!

799
01:08:59,752 --> 01:09:02,620
Huh? Follow me!

800
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:05,485
Yeah.

801
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:09,518
Let's go, Bad Josh!

802
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,951
Let's go!

803
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:15,950
Hey!

804
01:09:51,986 --> 01:09:54,816
No! No! No!

805
01:13:08,486 --> 01:13:10,683
Come on!

806
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:13,020
Goddamn it.

807
01:15:33,019 --> 01:15:35,716
No, no, no, no. Please.

808
01:15:35,718 --> 01:15:37,951
No, no. No.
No, no. No.

809
01:15:37,953 --> 01:15:39,783
No! No, no.

810
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,616
No, Zora. No!

811
01:15:41,618 --> 01:15:43,816
Please, please.

812
01:15:43,818 --> 01:15:46,549
No! No!

813
01:15:46,551 --> 01:15:48,484
No, please, no!

814
01:15:48,486 --> 01:15:51,784
No, no, no.

815
01:16:16,985 --> 01:16:19,051
It was unlocked.

816
01:16:19,053 --> 01:16:22,816
Boats are done.

817
01:16:22,818 --> 01:16:24,816
I am done with boats.

818
01:16:36,519 --> 01:16:39,083
I can't believe they're dead.

819
01:16:41,052 --> 01:16:43,051
Why are they doing this?

820
01:16:43,053 --> 01:16:45,084
I'm sorry,
but all of our operators

821
01:16:45,086 --> 01:16:46,816
are busy at the moment.

822
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:48,549
Please hold, and the next
available operator will...

823
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:50,151
It's all just craziness.

824
01:16:50,153 --> 01:16:52,649
I'm sorry,
but all of our operators

825
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,086
are busy at the moment.
Please...

826
01:16:55,885 --> 01:16:58,851
How does 911 keep you on hold
all night long?

827
01:16:58,853 --> 01:17:00,917
I just don't get it.

828
01:17:00,919 --> 01:17:03,417
It's too many twins, man.

829
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:12,683
How many of everybody
is there gonna be?

830
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:25,584
<i>The boardwalk
was getting ready to close,</i>

831
01:17:25,586 --> 01:17:26,984
<i>and a bunch of us
had just gotten out,</i>

832
01:17:26,986 --> 01:17:29,650
<i>and we were going to our cars
when the attack happened.</i>

833
01:17:29,652 --> 01:17:30,816
- Oh, shit.
- <i>People were shouting, and...</i>

834
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:32,051
- Don't curse.
- <i>...I-I just thought it was</i>

835
01:17:32,053 --> 01:17:34,517
<i>somebody acting out,
and then we just saw red.</i>

836
01:17:34,519 --> 01:17:36,649
- <i>Uh, you saw red?</i>
- <i>Yes, they were wearing red.</i>

837
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:38,383
<i>They didn't look right.
They had scissors,</i>

838
01:17:38,385 --> 01:17:40,617
<i>and they were just walking up
to people in the crowd</i>

839
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:42,117
<i>and stabbing them.</i>

840
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:44,150
<i>You said
they were stabbing people?</i>

841
01:17:44,152 --> 01:17:45,684
<i>Yeah, it was chaos,</i>

842
01:17:45,686 --> 01:17:47,383
<i>and then we-we just
started running.</i>

843
01:17:47,385 --> 01:17:48,617
<i>Where-where did they come from?</i>

844
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:50,150
<i>What? I-I-I don't know.</i>

845
01:17:50,152 --> 01:17:52,516
<i>Someone said that they were
coming from the sewers.</i>

846
01:17:52,518 --> 01:17:54,483
<i>The sewers?
Okay, how many are...</i>

847
01:17:54,485 --> 01:17:56,417
<i>I'm sorry.
I think they're coming.</i>

848
01:17:56,419 --> 01:17:58,917
<i>Uh, uh, ma'am?</i>

849
01:17:58,919 --> 01:18:01,616
<i>Ma'am?</i>

850
01:18:01,618 --> 01:18:05,650
<i>Um, okay, uh, so we certainly
hope everything is okay there.</i>

851
01:18:05,652 --> 01:18:08,617
<i>It's too early to say
what exactly is unfolding,</i>

852
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:10,750
<i>but it does appear
we are in the midst</i>

853
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,751
<i>of a brutal
and terrifying attack</i>

854
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:15,516
<i>by people who are being
described as wearing red,</i>

855
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:17,149
<i>carrying scissors or shears,
and doing</i>

856
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,784
<i>what can only be described
as wreaking havoc on folks</i>

857
01:18:19,786 --> 01:18:22,616
- <i>just out for a Friday night.</i>
- And they look like us.

858
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:24,617
They don't even know that yet.

859
01:18:24,619 --> 01:18:26,384
<i>Okay, Chris,
I'm gonna cut you off.</i>

860
01:18:26,386 --> 01:18:28,887
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>We have new images coming in here.</i>

861
01:18:31,485 --> 01:18:34,016
<i>Here, we see a man</i>

862
01:18:34,018 --> 01:18:36,816
<i>wearing red who...</i>

863
01:18:36,818 --> 01:18:38,516
<i>Okay, this...</i>

864
01:18:38,518 --> 01:18:41,517
<i>this seems to be
a group of individuals</i>

865
01:18:41,519 --> 01:18:45,851
<i>engaged in some sort
of demonstration or protest.</i>

866
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:48,850
<i>It-it's not clear at this time
if or how</i>

867
01:18:48,852 --> 01:18:50,018
<i>these people are connected
to the attacks.</i>

868
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,883
- What is that?
- <i>They are forming what looks</i>

869
01:18:51,885 --> 01:18:53,549
- <i>like a human chain.</i>
- That's them.

870
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:55,383
What are they doing?

871
01:18:55,385 --> 01:18:56,817
I don't know,
but that would take

872
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:58,987
a shitload of coordination.

873
01:19:00,885 --> 01:19:02,817
<i>So, obviously,
if you have children present</i>

874
01:19:02,819 --> 01:19:05,484
<i>watching us right now,
you should turn them away.</i>

875
01:19:05,486 --> 01:19:07,851
<i>We aren't sure
what is about to happen.</i>

876
01:19:10,085 --> 01:19:13,449
- We have to go.
- What? You're joking, right?

877
01:19:13,451 --> 01:19:15,716
Zora, Jason, help your father.

878
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:18,117
Wait, she's trippin'.
Where would we go?

879
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:19,783
- The police, right?
- No.

880
01:19:19,785 --> 01:19:22,017
We need to move
and keep moving.

881
01:19:22,019 --> 01:19:23,484
We take the coast.

882
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:25,616
- We go to Mexico.
- Mexico?

883
01:19:25,618 --> 01:19:27,583
Okay. Whoa.

884
01:19:27,585 --> 01:19:29,384
Whoa. Whoa!

885
01:19:29,386 --> 01:19:31,917
We got everything we need here.

886
01:19:31,919 --> 01:19:33,716
Food, water, backup generator.

887
01:19:33,718 --> 01:19:36,082
We're as safe here
as we're gonna be anywhere.

888
01:19:36,084 --> 01:19:37,952
Tell that to Josh and Kitty.
They're right here.

889
01:19:41,418 --> 01:19:43,816
- You're scaring the kids.
- Too late.

890
01:19:43,818 --> 01:19:46,751
They think like us.
They know where we are.

891
01:19:46,753 --> 01:19:50,516
They won't stop until
they kill us or we kill them.

892
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:52,784
Then let's make
some traps or something.

893
01:19:52,786 --> 01:19:54,783
Like, some <i>Home Alone</i>
type stuff.

894
01:19:54,785 --> 01:19:55,917
That way, if she comes...

895
01:19:55,919 --> 01:19:57,984
Tell me you did not
just reference <i>Home Alone.</i>

896
01:19:57,986 --> 01:20:00,016
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Gabe.

897
01:20:00,018 --> 01:20:01,851
They've been planning this.

898
01:20:01,853 --> 01:20:03,684
They have the upper hand.

899
01:20:03,686 --> 01:20:05,683
This is the time to run,

900
01:20:05,685 --> 01:20:08,986
not to be sprinkling
Micro Machines on the floor.

901
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:11,583
What are Micro Machines?

902
01:20:11,585 --> 01:20:13,117
What's <i>Home Alone?</i>

903
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:15,784
We're not going anywhere,
and that's final.

904
01:20:15,786 --> 01:20:19,020
You don't get to make
the decisions anymore!

905
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:27,616
So...

906
01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:30,520
does this mean
we get their car?

907
01:20:33,486 --> 01:20:36,083
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

908
01:20:36,085 --> 01:20:37,851
Who's got the keys?

909
01:22:06,018 --> 01:22:07,753
Come on.

910
01:22:10,984 --> 01:22:12,751
- Let's go.
- Get in the car.

911
01:22:12,753 --> 01:22:14,416
Get in the car.

912
01:22:15,786 --> 01:22:17,484
- I'm driving.
- No way.

913
01:22:17,486 --> 01:22:19,049
I told her no.

914
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:20,916
Dad's leg is messed up.
You're handcuffed.

915
01:22:20,918 --> 01:22:22,583
It's not safe.
I'm driving.

916
01:22:22,585 --> 01:22:23,982
Zora, no.

917
01:22:23,984 --> 01:22:25,883
I have the highest kill count
in the family.

918
01:22:25,885 --> 01:22:27,683
You don't have
the highest kill count.

919
01:22:27,685 --> 01:22:28,949
I killed both twins.

920
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:30,816
Wrong.
I just killed the second one.

921
01:22:30,818 --> 01:22:32,517
I killed Kitty.

922
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:35,583
So that's one, one,
one and two. I killed two.

923
01:22:35,585 --> 01:22:37,616
I killed myself and Josh, so...

924
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:38,816
Zo... It doesn't matter.

925
01:22:38,818 --> 01:22:40,483
Zora, get in the back.

926
01:22:40,485 --> 01:22:42,083
- Look! - No.
- Oh, shit, put the windows up.

927
01:22:42,085 --> 01:22:43,653
Put the windows up.
Put the windows up.

928
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:00,016
Okay.

929
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:02,117
You're gonna want to...

930
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:04,019
back up.

931
01:23:05,853 --> 01:23:07,720
- Buckle up.
- Huh?

932
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:12,783
- Zora!
- Whoa...

933
01:23:12,785 --> 01:23:15,849
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

934
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:17,784
Where is she? Did I get her?

935
01:23:29,017 --> 01:23:31,016
She's there, she's there!

936
01:23:31,018 --> 01:23:32,383
Jesus!

937
01:23:39,984 --> 01:23:41,452
Okay.

938
01:23:57,018 --> 01:23:59,949
Zora.

939
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:02,383
Be careful.

940
01:24:03,552 --> 01:24:05,783
Okay, you're going too fast!

941
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:13,085
She's dead now, right?

942
01:24:18,585 --> 01:24:20,450
- What are you doing?
- Mom.

943
01:24:20,452 --> 01:24:22,149
Where's she going?
Wait... And she left.

944
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:24,616
Your mom left the car.

945
01:25:05,585 --> 01:25:07,516
Shh, shh.

946
01:25:17,586 --> 01:25:18,949
Shh.

947
01:26:57,085 --> 01:26:59,683
Whoa.

948
01:26:59,685 --> 01:27:01,882
Is that our car?

949
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:04,049
It's the one
that looks like me.

950
01:27:06,419 --> 01:27:07,683
Shit.

951
01:27:07,685 --> 01:27:09,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, what?

952
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:30,553
Stay in the car.
Lock the doors.

953
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:02,982
What is she doing?

954
01:28:25,452 --> 01:28:27,019
It's a trap.

955
01:28:28,952 --> 01:28:30,818
Get out.

956
01:28:51,151 --> 01:28:52,852
Please.

957
01:29:06,518 --> 01:29:07,986
No.

958
01:29:22,585 --> 01:29:24,852
No.

959
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:51,918
Jason. Jason!

960
01:29:53,418 --> 01:29:55,083
Jason?

961
01:29:55,085 --> 01:29:56,819
Jason!

962
01:29:58,885 --> 01:30:00,682
Jason!

963
01:30:00,684 --> 01:30:02,982
No! No!

964
01:30:02,984 --> 01:30:04,850
- Addy!
- Mom!

965
01:35:07,151 --> 01:35:08,749
Here.

966
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:10,148
- We can hide here.
- Okay.

967
01:35:10,150 --> 01:35:12,649
- They probably got bandages and stuff.
- Okay.

968
01:35:14,952 --> 01:35:16,716
Mom knows what to do.

969
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:27,452
Look.

970
01:35:30,852 --> 01:35:32,552
It's the line.

971
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:39,552
Looks like some kind
of fucked-up performance art.

972
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:10,016
Where is he?

973
01:36:13,717 --> 01:36:17,719
How it must have been
to grow up with the sky.

974
01:36:19,018 --> 01:36:23,382
To feel the sun,
the wind, the trees.

975
01:36:23,384 --> 01:36:26,816
But your people
took it for granted.

976
01:36:26,818 --> 01:36:29,683
We're human, too, you know.

977
01:36:29,685 --> 01:36:32,716
Eyes, teeth,

978
01:36:32,718 --> 01:36:35,552
hands, blood.

979
01:36:36,651 --> 01:36:39,415
Exactly like you.

980
01:36:41,418 --> 01:36:43,515
And yet...

981
01:36:43,517 --> 01:36:46,916
it was humans

982
01:36:46,918 --> 01:36:49,115
that built this place.

983
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:54,048
I believe they figured out
how to make a copy of the body

984
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:56,049
but not the soul.

985
01:36:56,051 --> 01:36:59,949
The soul remains one,
shared by two.

986
01:36:59,951 --> 01:37:02,982
They created the T-ethered

987
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:07,850
so they could use them
to control the ones above.

988
01:37:07,852 --> 01:37:09,419
Like puppets.

989
01:37:10,918 --> 01:37:15,849
But they failed, and they
ab-andoned the Tethered.

990
01:37:15,851 --> 01:37:19,915
For generations, the Tethered
continued without direction.

991
01:37:21,617 --> 01:37:24,018
They all went mad down here.

992
01:37:27,951 --> 01:37:31,983
And then... there was us.

993
01:37:34,417 --> 01:37:36,015
Put some heat on that one.

994
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:38,516
Yeah, I guess
I missed my chance to go pro.

995
01:37:38,518 --> 01:37:40,018
<i>You remember?</i>

996
01:37:45,918 --> 01:37:49,783
We were born special.

997
01:37:49,785 --> 01:37:53,048
- I want number 11.
- Yeah?

998
01:38:38,084 --> 01:38:39,982
Addy, you want to try it?

999
01:39:04,017 --> 01:39:08,948
God brought us tog-ether
that night.

1000
01:39:55,517 --> 01:39:59,384
I never st-op thinking
about you.

1001
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:04,116
<i>How things could have been.</i>

1002
01:40:04,118 --> 01:40:07,749
<i>How you could have
taken me with you.</i>

1003
01:40:11,084 --> 01:40:13,116
Years after we met...

1004
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:17,485
<i>...the miracle happened.</i>

1005
01:40:20,384 --> 01:40:22,848
<i>That's when I saw God,</i>

1006
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:26,782
<i>and he showed me my path.</i>

1007
01:40:26,784 --> 01:40:28,882
<i>You felt it, too.</i>

1008
01:40:31,618 --> 01:40:34,382
<i>The end of our dance,</i>

1009
01:40:34,384 --> 01:40:38,149
<i>the Tethered saw
that I was different.</i>

1010
01:40:38,151 --> 01:40:41,949
<i>That I would deliver them
from this misery.</i>

1011
01:40:41,951 --> 01:40:45,049
I found my faith,

1012
01:40:45,051 --> 01:40:47,885
and I began to prepare.

1013
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:52,649
<i>It took years to plan.</i>

1014
01:40:58,618 --> 01:41:01,018
<i>Everything had to be perfect.</i>

1015
01:41:04,751 --> 01:41:07,515
<i>I didn't just need to kill you.</i>

1016
01:41:07,517 --> 01:41:10,683
<i>I needed to m-ake a statement</i>

1017
01:41:10,685 --> 01:41:13,618
<i>that the whole world would see.</i>

1018
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:19,483
It's our time now.

1019
01:41:19,485 --> 01:41:22,484
Our t-ime up there.

1020
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:36,915
And to think,

1021
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:39,051
if it weren't for you...

1022
01:41:41,718 --> 01:41:44,951
...I never would have
danced at all.

1023
01:46:57,616 --> 01:47:00,116
My baby. My baby.

1024
01:47:00,118 --> 01:47:02,416
I found you.

1025
01:47:02,418 --> 01:47:03,717
Oh!

1026
01:47:06,117 --> 01:47:07,648
Look.

1027
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:09,085
Look, look, look.

1028
01:47:18,118 --> 01:47:21,415
They're all gone now.

1029
01:47:21,417 --> 01:47:22,949
Okay?

1030
01:47:22,951 --> 01:47:24,884
They can't hurt you.

1031
01:47:26,751 --> 01:47:28,818
You understand?

1032
01:47:29,984 --> 01:47:31,914
Uh-uh.

1033
01:47:33,917 --> 01:47:35,815
No.

1034
01:47:35,817 --> 01:47:38,517
Everything's gonna be
like it was before.

1035
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:46,017
Yeah.

1036
01:48:54,816 --> 01:48:57,082
She wasn't in 'Nam.

1037
01:48:57,084 --> 01:48:59,415
<i>Okay? She got lost.
For 15 minutes. That's...</i>

1038
01:48:59,417 --> 01:49:00,949
<i>That can be very scary.</i>

1039
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:02,849
<i>No, you don't know
what happened to her.</i>

1040
01:49:02,851 --> 01:49:05,414
- Anything could've happened to her.
- Okay, okay.

1041
01:49:05,416 --> 01:49:08,381
So how-how...
how do we get her to talk?

1042
01:49:08,383 --> 01:49:11,015
<i>Encourage her to draw,</i>

1043
01:49:11,017 --> 01:49:13,014
<i>to write, to dance.</i>

1044
01:49:13,016 --> 01:49:15,648
<i>Anything to help her
tell us her story.</i>

1045
01:49:17,383 --> 01:49:20,484
I just want
my little girl back.

1046
01:50:29,516 --> 01:50:31,515
<i>Okay? She left.</i>

1047
01:50:31,517 --> 01:50:33,915
- She...
- I told you to look after her.

1048
01:50:33,917 --> 01:50:36,015
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Look at you.

1049
01:50:36,017 --> 01:50:37,915
- It's not my fault she left.
- Look at you.

1050
01:50:37,917 --> 01:50:39,882
It's not my fault
she... Yeah, well, look at me.

1051
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:41,085
Look at you. Look at you!
