00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,883
What happened to you?

180
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:27,982
Your father had a stroke
two months ago.

181
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,822
Why didn't anybody tell me?

182
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,590
You never return my calls.

183
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,056
It's because I never know
what to say to you.

184
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,864
I take it I wasn't the easiest
person to get along with in the past,

185
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,230
- but I've changed.
- Really?

186
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,002
Yes. A stroke can do that
to a man.

187
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,941
Listen, I'm sorry
about your wife.

188
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:50,578
I hear you've
brought her home.

189
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,310
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

190
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,944
I'll call Henry Walker,
make the arrangements.

191
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,783
No, that's okay,
I can take care of it.

192
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,052
Jamie, please. As your father,
it's the least I can do.

193
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,116
You've done the least
you can do my whole life.

194
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,458
It's too late
for charity now.

195
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,460
Is that why you've come here,

196
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,125
to remind me what a bad
father I've been to you?

197
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,898
In light of what has happened, I was
hoping we could put that in the past.

198
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,939
I didn't come
to talk about that, I...

199
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:17,167
I came to ask you something.

200
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,575
Do you remember when I was a
kid, Mom used to read me a poem?

201
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,808
Do you remember what it was?

202
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,550
What poem?

203
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,381
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

204
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,349
"She had no children,
only dolls

205
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,187
"And if you see her
in your dreams..."

206
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,295
"Be sure you never,
ever scream"

207
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,492
You know it?

208
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,661
It's just a scary poem parents would
tell their kids to keep them in line.

209
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,605
No. It's more than just a ghost story.
And the adults believed in it, as well.

210
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:52,006
We live
in a small town, Jamie.

211

Small minds breed
small-minded superstitions.

212
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,582
That's all.
There's nothing else to tell.

213
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,673
Nothing?

214
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,774
Edward,

215
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,816
your son has been
through a lot.

216
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,412
Why don't we make up
a room for him?

217
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,451
No, that's okay.
I'm not staying long.

218
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,918
I got a funeral to prepare.

219
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,929

220
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,324

221
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,833
Won't you stay the night here?

222
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,769
It was nice meeting you, Ella.

223
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,808
Your father's changed. He's not
the same man that you remember.

224
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,137
Really?

225
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,745
You see that?

226
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:33,307
Mom used to be in that picture with
us, until he drove her to kill herself.

227
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,115
Had his second wife
in that one there.

228
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,286
But she was smart enough
to leave.

229
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,722
So, it's a good thing you're
going to outlive him, lady.

to paint you out.

to her family yet?

Only once. We didn't really
talk about casket choices.

on her other final request.

Not only did she ask
to be buried with her dolls,

444

a doll herself.

these pictures?

No, I have to take pictures.
It's part of my business.

the dummy and sent it to me?

killing until the screaming does.

Our family killed her?

529
00:59:29,932 --> 00:59:31,900
Along with others
from Ravens Fair.

530
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:35,961
But she didn't stay dead.

531
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,701
She came back
and took her revenge.

532
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:44,743
One by one, each of the men
involved were killed.

533
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,573
Their tongues ripped out.

534
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,675
And then the same thing
happened to their wives.

535
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,546
And then their children.

536
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,682
And their children's children.

537
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,818
All these years you've resented
me for sending you away,

538
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:02,092
but I did it to distance you
from this curse.

539
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,229
Distance?

540
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,898
Well, it found Lisa!

541
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:09,597
Lisa's death made me realize
we can't run from our fate.

542
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,075
Spirits have long memories.

543
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,338
She'll come for us in the end.

544
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:19,681
Now I'm paying
for the sins of my fathers.

545
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,307
Jamie, I'm sorry.

546
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:25,853
All I ever meant to do was to protect
you, even if it earned your hatred.

547
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,049
I don't know how,
but one way or another,

548
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,319
I'm going to stop this thing.

549
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,828
Please, Son!

550
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,595
Well, hey, there!

551
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,567
I was wondering if you could help
me with a missing person's case.

552
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:40,659
Wait.

553
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:44,497
I'm looking for a male, brown
hair, he's around this tall,

554
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,499
sometimes seen
with a hand up his ass.

555
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:52,144
Actually, his brothers and sisters
have just gone missing, too.

556
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:53,946
What are you talking about?

557
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:55,108
Somebody dug them up.

558
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,577
All 100 of them.

559
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,485
What I want to know is
who did it and why.

560
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,819
So do I!

561
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,495
Don't give me some ghost story about
a woman who kills you if you scream,

562
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:08,789
because nobody in this town
has ever heard of Mary Shaw

563
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:09,991
or your little fairy tale.

564
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,090
They're lying!

565
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,462
They're afraid!

566
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:13,593
Afraid of what?

567
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,334
Afraid of ghosts?

568
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,101
Or are they afraid of talking to the cop
who's investigating your wife's murder?

569
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,473
They have no reason
to protect me.

570
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:24,572
But they believe in Mary Shaw.

571
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,976
That's why they won't answer
your stupid questions.

572
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:30,450
No, it's you who won't
answer my questions, Jamie.

573
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,384
That's why I'm going to arrest
you for stealing evidence.

574
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:33,945
Then I'm going to sit
you down, and you will...

575
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,355
What do you want
me to tell you?

576
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,686
Something less perplexing
than a ghost story. Come on.

577
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:41,996
Jamie, is everything
all right?

578
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,232
It's for you.
They said it was urgent.

579
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:51,666
Go ahead.

580
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,504
<i>- Hello?
- HENRY ON PHONE: Jamie.</i>

581
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,005
Who is this?

582
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,079
<i>Jamie?</i>

583
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,239
Henry?

584
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:04,245
<i>(DISTORTED) I can prove it.</i>

585
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,686
Henry, I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

586
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,288
<i>I can prove it.</i>

587
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:10,985
<i>I can... you didn't kill her.</i>

588
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,425
<i>There's a way, at the theater.</i>

589
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,556
<i>Meet me at the theater.
It's on Lost Lake.</i>

590
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:17,929
Yeah, I know where it is.

591
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:19,933
<i>Now, Jamie.</i>

592
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,164
Henry, wait!
What have you found?

593
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,932
Henry! Henry!

594
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:32,308
That was Henry Walker
from the funeral home.

595
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,712
He says he can prove
I didn't kill my wife.

596
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,877
Convenient time for
him to call. Let's go.

597
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,944
Wait, wait, wait. I'm going
to meet him at the theater.

598
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,045
That's where I'm going.

599
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:41,214
No, you're going with me.

600
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,757
Your appointment
with me comes first.

601
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,259
You wanted answers.
I'm giving you answers.

602
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:48,320
Camp is over. I'm done with
the ghost stories. Let's go.

603
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:52,022
(WHISPERING) Listen, we're talking
about my wife here. Come on.

604
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,196
(WHISPERING)
Do us both a favor, Jamie.

605
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,700
Don't make me cuff you
in front of your mom.

606
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:06,742
Jamie!

607
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,177
Jamie. Jamie!

608
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,354
Hey, you don't want
to make me chase you!

609
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,411
Jamie!

610
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,027
I don't have
a full tank of gas!

611
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,452
LIPTON: Jamie!

612
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,059
Henry?

613
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,331
Jamie!

614
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,345
Hello?

615
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,980
Where are you?

616
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:57,852
Henry?

617
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,157
Henry?

618
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,680
Henry?

619
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:25,286
<i>HENRY: Come on, Jamie.
I'm up here.</i>

620
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,013
I'm coming, Jamie.

621
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,515
Jamie?

622
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,592
I know you're here.

623
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,622
<i>I'm in here.</i>

624
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:31,646
(WHISPERING) Henry?

625
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:49,895
Henry?

626
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,030
Guess again.

627
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,402
He's here.

628
01:06:55,477 --> 01:06:58,378
Nobody's here. Our boats
were the only two out there.

629
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,074
Listen, I'm telling you
he's here!

630
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,275
And I'm telling you

631
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,818
he is not here!

632
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:05,576
<i>HENRY: Yes, he is.</i>

633
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:12,819
If you say I told you so,
I'll shoot you.

634
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,056
Where the hell are you?

635
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:39,678
(MARY SHAW HUMMING)

636
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:44,482
Hang on to this for a second.

637
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:47,426
Where are you going?

638
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:04,944
Remember, whatever happens,

639
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:06,573
don't scream.

640
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:12,649
Jamie. Jamie?

641
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:18,118
Jamie?

642
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:21,554
Jamie!

643
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,460
You follow me.

644
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,631
Yes, sir.

645
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:28,654
All right, Jamie,
where is he?

646
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:41,504
You know, if I see
one more of these...

647
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,648
They're all here.

648
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,100
JAMIE: Yep.

649
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,134
All home.

650
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:29,688
Someone brought them
back here.

651
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,832
All but one.

652
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,400
What?

653
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:51,746
What the hell is that?

654
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,005
Is that a doll?

655
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,536
It's not a doll.

656
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:29,347
It's a boy.

657
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,322
You mean, it was a boy.

658
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,405
- It's me.
- All right, I get it.

659
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:55,808
I think we just solved a
70-year-old missing person's case.

660
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,402
Who was that?

661
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,579
A long-lost relative.

<i>To silence all those
who silenced me.</i>
