1
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>The child is dead.</i>

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,240
<i>He breathed just for a moment.
Then he breathed no more.</i>

3
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,280
<i>The child is dead. Dead. The child is dead.</i>

4
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm afraid it will kill her.

5
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
My God, she wanted a baby so much.

6
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
For such a long time.

7
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,000
What can I tell her? What will I say?

8
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,240
You could adopt a child.

9
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,080
She wanted her own.

10
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,920
If I may suggest,

11
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,440
it even resembles...

12
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,960
Your wife need never know.

13
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,000
It would be a blessing to her
and to the child.

14
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
Are there no relatives?

15
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,960
None.

16
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,200
The mother died, as your own child,

17
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,600
in the same moment.

18
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,440
You said it could be ours, but...

19
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,800
On this night, Mr Thorn,

20
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,480
God has given you a son.

21
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
Here's your boy.

22
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,160
<i>Good morning. Come va?</i>

23
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,600
- What are you doing home so early?
- Just came to start packing.

24
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,480
What?

25
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
<i>We can't waste any time. We're leaving
in the morning. Buongiorno, Carlo.</i>

26
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Please, Carlo.

27
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
What are you talking about?

28
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,280
I am talking about London. I am talking about
the ambassador to the Court of St James.

29
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:29,320
- Well, what about him?
- You're married to him.

30
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,080
I'm what?

31
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,160
It's me. I'm appointed
ambassador to Great Britain.

32
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,280
I've already told them yes.
I loved it the minute I saw it.

33
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,320
Well, it's a bit much.

34
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,440
Well, nothing's too much for the wife
of the future president of the United States.

35
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,760
You know, you're pushy.

36
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,240
Come on. Wait till you see this.

37
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,520
Now this, they call his day room.

38
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
His day room.

39
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
So? How do you like it so far?

40
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,520
- Well, it needs some books. To warm it up.
- Couple of books. Warm it up. Yeah.

41
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,920
- Something in mind, Mr Ambassador?
- Why don't we have a little look upstairs?

42
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,960
Well, there's no furniture up there, either.

43
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,160
You know, you could be
too sexy for the White House.

44
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,679
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I won't be long.

45
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,080
We don't have that much to talk about.

46
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,000
Since when did two old college roommates
not have much to talk about?

47
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,200
Since one of them assumed
the awesome burden of the presidency.

48
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
- Well, give my regards to the first lady.
- I'll do my best.

49
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,640
Why don't you change you mind,
fly over with me?

50
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,400
No, I'd better stay here
and fool around with Damien.

51
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,040
- Where is he?
- He was right behind us...

52
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,920
Damien?

53
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
Oh, my God, Robert.

54
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,480
Damien! Robert, where could he be?

55
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,960
You little monkey.
Don't you ever do that again.

56
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,440
There you are.

57
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,680
- Go.
- Hooray.

58
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,160
- Run out of film?
- Just saving a bit for his canonization.

59
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,200
- How's that?
- He's either the heir to the Thorn millions

60
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,280
- or Jesus Christ himself.
- Want a bite, Daddy?

61
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
Go on, Damien. Smile. A big birthday smile.

62
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,480
Come on. Smile.

63
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,120
Holly.

64
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,120
- I'll take him, ma'am.
- No, I'll take him.

65
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,440
Come on.

66
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,160
One... two... three...

67
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,320
Let me jump on it, Daddy. Let me jump on it.

68
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,120
Hold on.

69
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,520
Damien.

70
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,440
Damien, look at me.

71
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm over here.

72
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
- Damien, I love you.
- Look. There's Nanny.

73
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,320
Look at me, Damien. It's all for you.

74
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
Oh, my God.

75
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,400
Go, Tom.

76
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,720
- Morning. Have you read the papers today?
- No, I haven't.

77
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,960
There was an article on the suicide,
your nanny thatjumped.

78
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,600
- They say that she left a suicide note, sir.
- Not true.

79
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,480
Mr Ambassador,
did you know she was on drugs?

80
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Would you mind?

81
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,160
- Mr Thorn, did she use drugs?
- Not that I know of.

82
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,080
- The article said...
- I don't care what the article said.

83
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm sorry.

84
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,200
I am sorry.
Will you send me a bill for the damage?

85
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,039
No, that's all right, Mr Ambassador.
Let's just say you owe me.

86
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,040
Corporal.

87
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
OK, outside.

88
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,800
Yes?

89
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,480
<i>- There's a Father Brennan here to see you.
- Who?</i>

90
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,880
<i>A priest named Father Brennan from Rome.</i>

91
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,440
<i>He says it's a matter of
urgent personal business.</i>

92
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,600
<i>- Never heard of him.
- He says he just needs a minute.</i>

93
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,720
<i>- Something about a hospital.
- Donation time.</i>

94
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,520
- All right, send him in.
- I didn't know you were such a soft touch.

95
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
On that trip to Saudi Arabia,
why isn't it the right time?

96
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,560
Well, it's personal, Tom. I just
don't feel like leaving home right now.

97
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Yes, Father?

98
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,000
We haven't much time.
You must listen to what I have to say.

99
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,560
All right. What is it?

100
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,160
You must accept Christ as your savior.
You must accept him now.

101
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,720
Forgive me, but didn't I understand that you
have a matter of urgent personal business?

102
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,720
You must take Communion.
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh.

103
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Only if he is within you
can you defeat the son of the devil.

104
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,320
- I see.
- He's killed once. He'll kill again.

105
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
He'll kill until everything that's yours is his.

106
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,760
- Father, would you mind...
- Only through Christ can you fight him.

107
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,040
Accept the Lord Jesus.

108
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,440
Drink his blood.

109
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,200
I've locked the door, Mr Thorn.

110
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,120
<i>- Yes?
- Would you send for a security guard?</i>

111
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,200
I beg you, Mr Thorn.
Listen to what I have to say.

112
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,680
<i>Ambassador Thorn?</i>

113
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,480
I was at the hospital, Mr Thorn,
the night your son was born.

114
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,240
<i>- I witnessed the birth.
- Sir?</i>

115
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
I beg you.

116
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,840
All right. Stand by.

117
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:11,480
- What do you want?
- To save you, Mr Thorn.

118
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,160
So Christ will forgive me.

119
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,720
What do you know about my son?

120
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,000
- Everything.
- And what is that?

121
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,560
I saw its mother.

122
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,960
- You saw my wife.
- I saw its mother.

123
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,840
- You're referring to my wife.
- Its mother, Mr Thorn.

124
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,280
This is blackmail. Come out and say it.
What are you trying to say?

125
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,960
His mother was aja...

126
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,600
- Everything OK?
- You sounded strange. The door was locked.

127
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
- I want this gentleman escorted out of here.
- OK, let's go.

128
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,880
Accept Christ each day.

129
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Drink his blood.

130
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,520
- Just get him off the grounds.
- All right, Father. Come on.

131
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,640
Father.

132
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Thank you.

133
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Come in.

134
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,720
Excuse me. Mrs Baylock is here.

135
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,480
She says she's the new governess.

136
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,360
Well, that's a start. Show her in.

137
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,720
Come in, please.

138
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,560
- Ambassador and Mrs Thorn.
- How do you do?

139
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,800
I know it's a difficult time for you,
so I'll not intrude on your grief.

140
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm here to take away
some of your troubles and anxieties.

141
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,280
We'll soon help your little boy
to forget what's happened.

142
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,160
I'm afraid, sir,
that some of our young nannies,

143
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,920
they get homesick,
or they have boyfriend problems.

144
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,520
I left all that behind a long time ago.

145
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,280
Well, now, if you'll let me see your boy?

146
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,440
Yes, of course. He's upstairs.
I'll show you where it is.

147
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,600
Why don't you just leave us alone at first?
Let us get acquainted in our own way.

148
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,840
- Well, he's shy with new people.
- Oh, no. Not with me, he won't be.

149
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,920
- Well, I don't think...
- I think it'll be fine.

150
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,599
Go on. Give it a try.

151
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,160
All right, then.

152
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,640
- Mrs Horton.
- This way, Mrs Baylock.

153
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Excuse me.

154
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,440
- I like her.
- She seems all right.

155
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,440
Where'd you find her?

156
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,440
- Where did I find her?
- Yeah.

157
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,880
I didn't find her. I assumed you found her.

158
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,119
Round that corner to the right
and it's the door facing you.

159
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,240
- I'll have your things sent up in a moment.
- Thank you.

160
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,439
- Mrs Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

161
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,160
I'm sorry, but we're a little bit confused.

162
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,280
Oh? Why's that?

163
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,600
- Well, we don't know how you got here.
- The agency.

164
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,040
- The agency?
- Well, yes. They read in the paper about the...

165
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,240
well, about your first nanny,
so they sent you another.

166
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,360
- That's it.
- I'll call to confirm that.

167
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,680
- Here are my references.
- Thank you very much.

168
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,720
Well, if I could see your boy, now?

169
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,400
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

170
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
Have no fear, little one.

171
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,320
I am here to protect thee.

172
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,320
- In a minute, Horton, I think.
- Very good, sir.

173
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,760
- Kathy.
- I'm coming. Mrs Baylock.

174
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
- Mrs Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

175
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,320
- Where's Damien?
- If you don't mind,

176
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,720
I think he'd rather go to the park.

177
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,479
- The park? I told you he was going with us.
- He's too young for church.

178
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,920
- He'll cause a fuss.
- You don't seem to understand.

179
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,240
It is my wish and my husband's wish
that Damien accompanies us to church.

180
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,200
- Kathy.
- I'll be there in a minute.

181
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,640
Now, please have him dressed at once.

182
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,120
Well, excuse me
for speaking my mind, ma'am,

183
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,600
but do you really think a five-year-old

184
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,600
will understand the goings-on
of an Episcopal wedding?

185
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,160
Will you have my son dressed and in the car
in five minutes? Thank you very much.

186
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,680
What's the matter, Damien?

187
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,680
It's just a church, that's all.

188
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
What's the matter?

189
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
- Robert.
- Something wrong?

190
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,120
- I don't know. He just seems scared to death.
- Is he ill?

191
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,160
No, he's just...

192
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,960
No, he's just trembling all over.

193
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,840
- Mr Ambassador. Welcome, sir.
- Good morning.

194
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,520
- No!
- Damien.

195
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,720
Damien, stop it.

196
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,320
Damien, stop it. Damien.

197
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,320
No!

198
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,640
Horton, drive on.

199
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,440
Are you sure that
you don't wanna call a doctor?

200
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,080
No, it's just a couple of bruises.
It'll be all right in the morning.

201
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,760
No, I mean for Damien.

202
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,400
Oh, no, he's fine. He's sound asleep.

203
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Just to have him examine him.

204
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,120
Well, he's perfectly all right.
Never been sick a day in his life.

205
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,040
He never has, has he?
Isn't that a little strange?

206
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,480
Is it?

207
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,840
I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox.

208
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,200
- Not even a cough or a cold.
- So?

209
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,480
I just think it's a little unusual.

210
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,320
Look, he's a perfectly healthy boy.

211
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,840
I mean, we have nothing to worry about
with him. Not physically or otherwise.

212
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,880
He just had a bad moment.

213
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,240
You know, like a fright.

214
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,800
Yes?

215
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,880
- I'm leavin' now. Is there anything else?
- Nothing, thank you. Good night.

216
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,640
I think the best thing to do with a bad day
like this is end it. I'm gonna go to bed.

217
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,040
I'll be along soon.

218
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,160
Quiet, now. This is the master of the house.

219
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,000
- What is this?
- Sir?

220
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,280
The dog.

221
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,480
- Beautiful, isn't he? We found him outside.
- Who gave you permission to bring it in?

222
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,800
I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir.
And Damien loves him.

223
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
Gave you a fright, did he, sir?

224
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,320
- Yes.
- Well, you see how good he is.

225
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,960
As a watchdog, I mean. I think you'll be
grateful on your long trips away, sir.

226
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,880
Mrs Baylock, we don't need a dog,

227
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,760
and if we do, I'll pick him out myself.

228
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,800
- Damien's taken quite a fancy to him, sir.
- Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA,

229
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,240
tell them to collect the dog
and find him another home.

230
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
You understand?

231
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,599
Sir.

232
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,119
Come on, boy.

233
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,240
<i>Welcome to Windsor Safari Park.</i>

234
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,120
<i>Animal compound to your left.</i>

235
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,240
<i>Parking, for refreshment and zoo area,
to your right.</i>

236
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,200
<i>When driving through animal compounds,
please keep all car windows closed.</i>

237
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Thank you.

238
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,160
Thank you.

239
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,720
Come on, darling.
Let's go see the monkeys, OK?

240
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,920
- Good morning, Horton.
- Good morning, sir.

241
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,400
<i>Baboons bite. Keep all car windows closed.</i>

242
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,040
<i>Keep all car windows closed.</i>

243
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,400
<i>Baboons are dangerous.</i>

244
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,880
Oh, no.

245
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
- All right, Kathy?
- Yeah.

246
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,120
You're so silent this evening.

247
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Just tired, I guess. Sorry.

248
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,080
- Damien all right?
- Yeah.

249
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,080
- You sure?
- Yes.

250
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,360
If there were anything wrong,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

251
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,600
Wrong? What could be wrong with our child,
Robert? We're beautiful people, aren't we?

252
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,760
There is something wrong, isn't there?

253
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,640
Kathy.

254
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,680
Is it so serious?

255
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,120
Robert, I want...

256
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,840
I need to see a psychiatrist. I have fears.

257
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,239
I have such fears.

258
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,280
What kind of fears? What kind?

259
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,080
If I told you, you'd put me away.

260
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,920
Kathy, I love you. I love you.

261
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,800
Then help me. Find me a doctor.

262
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,480
I will. Of course I will.

263
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,720
Keep that scrum tight.
Get down low. Come on.

264
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,240
Let it go. Let it go.

265
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,400
Bring him down.

266
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,479
Well done.

267
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,640
I don't know what you're clapping for.
You just lost a bet.

268
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,680
- That's right. 27-3?
- Right. That'll be three quid.

269
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,439
- I thought it was two.
- Inflation. Haven't you heard, old boy?

270
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,640
Well done, George. Great stuff.

271
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,120
It was a good game.

272
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,240
Go and have a quick drink with the lads.

273
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,680
That'll give me time
to make sure everything's set up.

274
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,680
Tomorrow, half past two, Bishop's Park.
Five minutes and you'll never see me again.

275
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,520
Your wife is in danger.
She'll die unless you come.

276
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Father.

277
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,880
Thanks again.

278
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Get on with it. Say what you have to say.

279
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,360
"When the Jews return to Zion,
and a comet rips the sky,

280
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,040
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,
then you and I must die."

281
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,280
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore,

282
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,960
turning man against his brother,
till man exists no more."

283
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,040
- The Book of Revelations predicted it all.
- I'm not here to listen to a sermon.

284
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,600
"It is by means of a human personality
entirely in his possession

285
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,960
that Satan will wage
his last and formidable offense."

286
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,480
- You said that my wife...
- Go to the town of Megiddo

287
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,880
in the old city of Jezreel.

288
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,520
There, see the old man Bugenhagen.

289
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,240
- He alone can say how the child must die.
- Look here...

290
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,720
"He who will not be saved by the lamb
will be torn by the beast."

291
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,760
Will you stop?

292
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm here because you said
my wife is in danger.

293
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,720
She is pregnant.

294
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:07,880
- You're mistaken. That's nonsense.
- He will not allow the child to be born.

295
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,800
- He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb.
- What are you talking about?

296
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,200
Your son, Mr Thorn.

297
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,720
The son of the devil.

298
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,320
He will kill the unborn child,
then he will kill your wife,

299
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,640
and when he is certain to inherit all that
is yours, then, Mr Thorn, he will kill you.

300
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,800
That's enough!

301
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,320
With your power, he will establish
his counterfeit kingdom here,

302
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:35,120
receiving his power directly from Satan.

303
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,040
- You're insane.
- He must die, Mr Thorn.

304
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,320
You asked for five minutes,
and you've got five minutes.

305
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,000
Go to the city of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen before it's too late.

306
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,760
Now, I've heard you.

307
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,520
I want you to hear me.

308
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,520
I never want to see you again.

309
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,560
You'll see me in hell, Mr Thorn.

310
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,400
There will we share out our sentence.

311
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,360
No!

312
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,000
Mrs Baylock.

313
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,880
- Anything wrong?
- I just can't stand that noise.

314
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,680
It's not all that bad.

315
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,280
- Good morning, Damien.
- Good morning, Daddy.

316
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,800
- What are we gonna do?
- Hold my hands.

317
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,880
- Right.
- Mrs Baylock.

318
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yes, ma'am?

319
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,760
- Would you take him out of here, please?
- He's only playing.

320
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,520
Would you just get him out of here, please?

321
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,640
Yes, ma'am.

322
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,160
Come along, Damien. Excuse me, sir.

323
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Come along.

324
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,400
Darling, I don't know
what's the matter with me. I just...

325
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,360
I just don't seem to be able to...

326
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,880
I don't know.

327
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Kathy, I love you.

328
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,800
If this is what the doctor's doing to you,

329
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,160
don't you think it's time
I had a talk with him?

330
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Yes, you should.

331
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:37,040
There's something
he wants to talk to you about, anyway.

332
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,120
Oh?

333
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,120
Robert, I don't ever
want to have any more children.

334
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,881
All right.

335
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,160
Then you'll agree to an abortion?

336
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,680
I'm pregnant, Robert.
I just found out this morning.

337
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,600
Yes?

338
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Yes, this is he.

339
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,439
Who?

340
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
Who? But...

341
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,000
Hello?

342
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Hello?

343
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,520
Something about the newspapers.

344
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,399
Well, she knew how much you wanted one.

345
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,040
Now she can't cope. She searches for reasons
that won't make her feel inadequate.

346
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,640
She has these fantasies.

347
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,280
She fantasises that your child is alien
and that your child is evil.

348
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,880
She thinks that the child is evil?

349
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,280
The point is, at this time,
another child would be disastrous.

350
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,000
Well, in what way evil?

351
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,600
Now, this is just fantasy.
She also thinks the child isn't hers.

352
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,440
The most important thing for you to do
is to agree to an abortion.

353
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
No.

354
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,760
I'd like to know your reason.

355
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,240
It was foretold that
this pregnancy would be terminated.

356
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,320
I'm going to fight to see that it's not.

357
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,720
- Forgive me, Doctor.
- Please don't leave.

358
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,200
I'm sorry. I must get home.

359
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,880
Damien.

360
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,479
No, no, no, no!

361
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,520
No! No!

362
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,240
Are there any developments
on the state of your wife, sir?

363
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,560
- How is your wife, Mr Ambassador?
- Is there any news, sir?

364
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,320
- Ambassador Thorn?
- Yes. Doctor?

365
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,600
My name is Becker.

366
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,280
Is she all right?

367
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Well, she will recover.

368
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,680
She's in there. Bed by the window.

369
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,200
She has a concussion
and a broken humerus,

370
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,360
and, well, some internal bleeding.

371
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,080
- Internal bleeding?
- Yes.

372
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,480
But she's pregnant.

373
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,920
No.

374
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,120
- She's lost it?
- Afraid so.

375
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,760
You know, you've got a lot to be grateful for.
She's still alive.

376
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,720
And, with proper care,
she can still have children.

377
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,959
Robert.

378
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,280
Robert.

379
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,720
Don't let him kill me.

380
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,000
Don't let him kill me.

381
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,800
Kathy.

382
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,360
It's all right.

383
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,120
<i>- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you, Ambassador Thorn.</i>

384
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,600
- Who is this?
- My name is Keith Jennings, sir.

385
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,880
The photographer
whose camera got smashed.

386
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,680
Would it be possible
to have a word with you at my flat?

387
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,360
- If it's about the camera...
- No, it's not about the camera.

388
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,240
It's about you, Mr Thorn.

389
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,040
And the death of the priest.

390
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,560
Go on.

391
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,520
Do you notice anything unusual?

392
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,360
No. Sorry.

393
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,160
At first I thought
this was just a fault in the film.

394
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,680
A strange coincidence.

395
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,160
Then it happened again.

396
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,640
Interesting, don't you think?

397
00:55:26,959 --> 00:55:31,400
And this, I took on the day
that you were at the rugby match.

398
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,880
- Same thing?
- Only it's more pronounced

399
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,440
and it's actually
making contact with the body.

400
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,080
The rest, of course - history.

401
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
I can't explain it.

402
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:55,160
That's why I started digging. The coroner's
report shows that he was riddled with cancer.

403
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,280
High on morphine most of the time.
Injected himself two or three times a day.

404
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,840
- He knew that he was dying?
- Apparently, yes.

405
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,520
He said that he wanted
to be forgiven by Christ.

406
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:16,280
Externally, his body was normal, except for
one thing on the inside of his right thigh.

407
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,040
- What is it?
- Three sixes.

408
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,400
Six hundred and sixty-six.

409
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,960
- Concentration camp?
- That's what I thought.

410
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:34,120
But the biopsy says it's a birthmark.
The best is yet to come.

411
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,960
Pages of the Bible. Thousands of 'em.

412
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,880
Every inch of wall-space covered,
even the windows.

413
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,920
He even needed to be close to his church.

414
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,760
There are 47. I counted them.

415
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,760
I think he was trying
to keep something out, don't you?

416
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:15,240
The police thought he was insane. They let
me come here to see if I could find anything.

417
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,840
The first item is a diary.

418
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,479
It didn't say anything about him.

419
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:32,040
It's about you. What time
you left the house, where you went,

420
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,560
what restaurants you had your lunch in,
what time your speaking engagements were.

421
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,720
The last entry says that he was supposed to
have met you in Bishop's Park.

422
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,400
And that was dated the day he died.

423
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:52,160
The important items are here. If we're to get
to the bottom of this, we've got to start here.

424
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,000
<i>This first clipping
is from the Astrologer's Monthly.</i>

425
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,840
Reports an unusual phenomenon. A comet
changed its shape into a glowing star,

426
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,520
like the star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago.

427
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,800
This one was on the other side of the world,
the European continent, five years ago.

428
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,480
6 June, to be exact.

429
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,479
Does that date mean anything to you?

430
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,400
Yes.

431
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,760
Then you'll recollect this other clipping.

432
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,680
It's a birth announcement
from a Rome newspaper.

433
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,040
Also dated 6 June, five years ago.

434
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,520
The day your son was born.

435
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
The sixth month, sixth day.

436
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,880
Was your son born at 6am?

437
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,760
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out
this birthmark. The three sixes.

438
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,640
My son is dead.

439
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,040
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

440
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,839
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to help you try and find out.

441
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,320
No. It's my problem.

442
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,439
No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too.

443
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,320
When I came here with the police,
I took some photographs.

444
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:31,800
I happened to catch sight
of my own reflection in that mirror.

445
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,960
I know you must think I'm crazy,
but I'm so frightened.

446
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:55,120
Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here.
You'll be perfectly all right.

447
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,040
Some all right!

448
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,360
- What about Damien?
- I'll speak to Mrs Horton.

449
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,040
She'll look after him.

450
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,320
Mrs Horton?

451
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,840
- Mrs Baylock.
- Sir.

452
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,440
- Where's Mrs Horton?
- Gone.

453
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,840
- Gone out?
- No, they've gone. They just got up and went.

454
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,160
They left an address for you
to send their last month's wages to.

455
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:39,800
Well, didn't Mrs Horton say anything?
Didn't Horton leave any explanation?

456
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,000
No. But don't worry, sir. I can manage.

457
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,200
- I'll look into this when I get back.
- Just as you wish, sir.

458
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,440
- And Mrs Baylock?
- Sir?

459
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,080
Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room.
I clearly told you...

460
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,000
He's gone now, sir.
They took him away this morning.

461
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,281
No.

462
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:51,439
This is the right address.

463
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,960
Apparently, there was a terrible fire
and the old hospital burned down.

464
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,400
Five years ago.

465
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,640
OK.

466
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,120
But surely the fire didn't destroy everything.
There must have been some records.

467
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,920
I sorry. I think everything was destroyed.

468
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Isn't it possible
there were some papers stored elsewhere?

469
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,280
- I do not know.
- Sister.

470
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,040
This is most important to me.

471
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,680
I adopted a child here.
I'm searching for some records of it...

472
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,640
- There were no adoptions here.
- There was one.

473
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,600
<i>- No, signore.
- It wasn't an actual adoption.</i>

474
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,120
- You are mistake.
- Wait.

475
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,920
Birth records.
If I gave you a date. An exact date.

476
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,760
It's no use. The fire started
in the hall of records in the basement.

477
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,599
All the paperwork was there.
Went up like a torch.

478
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,800
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.

479
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,600
- The third floor?
- The maternity wards. Nothing left but ashes.

480
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,960
- You will excuse me?
- What about the staff?

481
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,680
<i>- Surely some survived.
- Sì, some.</i>

482
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,520
There was a tall man, a priest.

483
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,320
Dark eyes. Piercing eyes.

484
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,760
Yes.

485
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,840
<i>- He was principale.
- Yes, he was in charge. Is he...</i>

486
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,040
- Yes, he is alive.
- Is he here?

487
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,280
- No.
- Where?

488
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,040
<i>He's in a monastero in Frosinone.</i>

489
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,440
Many were taken there. Many die.

490
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,000
Perhaps he is die since,
but he lived through the fire.

491
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,240
<i>I remember people say it was un miracolo.</i>

492
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,959
Frosinone?

493
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,440
- Here we are.
- What is it?

494
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,320
- "When the Jews return to Zion..."
- That's the poem.

495
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,920
"When the Jews return to Zion..."

496
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,880
And there was something about a comet.

497
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,080
Yes, that's here too. "The shower of stars
and the rise of the Roman Empire."

498
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,400
These are supposed to be the events
that signal the birth of the Antichrist.

499
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,520
The devil's child.

500
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:56,280
It's making more sense. The Jews have
returned to Zion and there has been a comet.

501
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,480
As for the rise of the Roman Empire,

502
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,800
scholars think that could well mean
the Common Market, the Treaty of Rome.

503
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,440
- Bit of a stretch.
- What about this? In Revelations it says:

504
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,360
- "He shall rise from the eternal sea."
- That's the poem again.

505
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:14,120
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore."

506
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,560
- That was the beginning of it.
- Theologians have interpreted

507
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,999
the "eternal sea"
as meaning the world of politics,

508
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,400
the sea that constantly rages
with turmoil and revolution.

509
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:31,080
So the devil's child will rise
from the world of politics.

510
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,919
Looks like this is as far as we go.

511
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,000
Let's have a look.

512
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,760
Found him?

513
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,400
His mind is active,
but since the fire he's not made a sound.

514
01:07:44,479 --> 01:07:46,880
We feed him and take care of his needs.

515
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,320
And we pray for his recovery
when his penance is completed.

516
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,880
What penance?

517
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,760
"Woe to the shepherd
who abandons his sheep."

518
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,800
"May his right arm wither
and his right eye lose its sight."

519
01:07:57,919 --> 01:08:00,679
He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why?

520
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,800
For abandoning Christ.

521
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,879
- How do you know he's abandoned Christ?
- He told us.

522
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,800
- But he doesn't speak.
- There is some movement in his left hand.

523
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,480
He was able to write it down.

524
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,280
You will notice the curved line over the head.

525
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:23,240
This indicates the hood of the monk.
His own hood.

526
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:26,400
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign of the devil.

527
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:31,000
- But why three of them?
- We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity.

528
01:08:31,081 --> 01:08:36,640
- The devil, Antichrist and false prophet.
- Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

529
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:42,600
For everything holy, there is something
unholy. This is the essence of temptation.

530
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,320
Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn.

531
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,840
There was a child.
I want to know where that child came from.

532
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,160
- I am afraid that...
- You confessed to them. Now confess to me.

533
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:05,040
<i>- What happened?
- Please, signore.</i>

534
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,480
You said you knew its mother.
Where is she now?

535
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:13,480
- I must insist that you do not...
- I beg you, where is she?

536
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,919
Answer me.

537
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,360
Answer.

538
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:32,000
Excuse me.

539
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,120
Cervet.

540
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,040
Please, does it mean something to you?

541
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,800
Cerveteri.

542
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,800
It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times.

543
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,479
Cripta Sant'Angelo.

544
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,879
- It is nothing but ruins.
- Where is this place?

545
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,440
- But there is nothing there. Only graves.
- Where is it?

546
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,520
You will find it on the map.
It is perhaps 50km north of Rome.

547
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,759
Robert, over here.

548
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,720
Maria Scianna.

549
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,840
My God.

550
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,760
June 6.

551
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,000
Five years ago.

552
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,200
Bambino Scianna.

553
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,680
Infant boy. Same date.

554
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:43,280
"In birth and death,
the generations embrace."

555
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,640
Is my son buried here?

556
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,440
This woman could be
the mother of the child you adopted.

557
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,360
Why here in this terrible place?

558
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,320
- No.
- Oh, my God.

559
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,160
- The other one.
- No. Let's get out of here.

560
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,960
If it's an animal too,

561
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,399
then maybe my child

562
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,280
is alive somewhere.

563
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,200
They murdered him.

564
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,640
They murdered him as soon as he was born.

565
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,280
Murderers.

566
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,080
Murderers.

567
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,160
Come on.

568
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,960
Robert.

569
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,880
Don't run. It's only the smell of the graves.

570
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,241
Run.

571
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,040
Robert.

572
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,520
- Hello?
- Hello.

573
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,640
Kathy?

574
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,359
<i>Hello, Robert. Is that you?
I'm so glad you called.</i>

575
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,720
Kathy, darling.
Now, listen to me very carefully.

576
01:19:28,801 --> 01:19:30,840
Do just what I say.

577
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,160
I want you to leave London right now.

578
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,280
<i>- What do you mean, leave London, darling?
- I've put through a call to the embassy.</i>

579
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:44,360
Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital
and bring you here to Rome.

580
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:48,080
<i>- Robert, what's happened? What's wrong?
- Please, darling. Just do it.</i>

581
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,560
<i>Get ready to leave.</i>

582
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,720
- Robert, I don't think I can move very well.
- Kathy, do it.

583
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,080
OK. Yes, all right, I'll try to be ready
by the time he gets here.

584
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,199
<i>All right, darling.</i>

585
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,399
Who is that? Is that somebody there?

586
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,880
Tom? Is that you?

587
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,240
Yes?

588
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,040
Yes, this is he.

589
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,320
Tom?

590
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,600
Kathy?

591
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,440
Tom,

592
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,640
I can't talk now.

593
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,041
Robert.

594
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,760
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

595
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,000
It's derived from the word "Armageddon".

596
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,520
The end of the world.

597
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,399
It's underground,
about 60 miles south of Jerusalem.

598
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,560
There's some excavation going on there.

599
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,720
If only you could remember the name
of the man you're supposed to see.

600
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,840
It's Bugenhagen.

601
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,280
He was an exorcist. I read about him.

602
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:41,800
That was his name.
And I remember the poem.

603
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,159
"When the Jews return to Zion,

604
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,840
and a comet fills the sky

605
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,280
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,

606
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,799
then you and I must die."

607
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,360
"From the eternal sea he rises,

608
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:02,319
creating armies on either shore

609
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:06,360
turning man against his brother

610
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,640
till man exists no more."

611
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,960
Kathy is dead.

612
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,880
I want Damien to die, too.

613
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,600
Hello, Mr Thorn.

614
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,000
I am Bugenhagen.

615
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,920
- What is this place?
- The city of Jezreel.

616
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,640
Town of Megiddo.

617
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,121
The place where Christianity began.

618
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,680
The little priest - is he dead yet?

619
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,359
Yes.

620
01:25:46,959 --> 01:25:48,960
Yes.

621
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,360
Come along, Mr Thorn.
We had better get to work.

622
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,160
You will excuse us.

623
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,880
This is for Mr Thorn alone.

624
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,640
All right.

625
01:27:07,601 --> 01:27:11,280
It must be done on hallowed ground.

626
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,480
A church.

627
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:19,040
His blood must be spilled on the altar of God.

628
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:26,320
This first knife is most important.

629
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:34,480
It extinguishes physical life
and forms the center of the cross.

630
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,200
The subsequent placings
extinguish spiritual life

631
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,520
and should radiate outward.

632
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:46,561
Like this.

633
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:55,200
This is not a human child. Make no mistake.

634
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,800
- Is there proof?
- Oh, yes.

635
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,160
He bears a birthmark.

636
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,800
A sequence of sixes.

637
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,640
So, says the Bible,
do all the apostles of Satan.

638
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:22,520
- He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

639
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,440
I've bathed him. I know every inch of him.

640
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:33,080
If it is not visible on the body,
it will be beneath the hair.

641
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,400
Remove it.

642
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,040
You must be devoid of pity.

643
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,320
- And the woman?
- She is an apostate of hell.

644
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,561
She will die before permitting this.

645
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:05,080
Look, I want to know what he said.
I've a right to know.

646
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,720
Robert, I want to know what he said.
Look, I'm notjust some bystander.

647
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,640
- I was the one that found him.
- I'm the one that's supposed to kill him.

648
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:17,480
These are knives. He wants me to stab him.

649
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,560
- Wants me to murder a child.
- It's not a child.

650
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,320
How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong.

651
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:28,400
It's insane. I won't have anything
to do with murdering a little boy.

652
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,359
He's not responsible. I won't do it.

653
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,919
Well, if you don't do it, I will.

654
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,760
No!

655
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,000
Run, Damien. Run. Run.

656
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,440
No!

657
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,361
Hold it.

658
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,640
<i>- Panda Four to control.
- MP to Panda Four, come in, please.</i>

659
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:16,439
Panda Four in pursuit.
American Ambassador, white estate car.

660
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,400
Heading north. Seven Hills Road. Over.

661
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,080
Al. We've got a shout.

662
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,200
I'll be back later, all right?

663
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:34,560
<i>MP to Zulu Seven.
You are requested assist Panda Four</i>

664
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,640
<i>in pursuit of white estate car,
north Seven Hills Road.</i>

665
01:40:37,839 --> 01:40:39,640
<i>Possible diplomatic incident.</i>

666
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:49,920
<i>Zulu Seven to Panda Four.
We have taken over your pursuit. Over.</i>

667
01:41:02,959 --> 01:41:06,960
<i>Zulu Seven to MP.
Heading west on Old Church Road.</i>

668
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,520
No! Please, Daddy, no!

669
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,760
- No, Daddy. No!
- God help me.

670
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:07,280
Police! Drop. Drop, or I'll fire.

671
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,440
And so to their final rest do we commit
these two and entrust them unto our Lord.

672
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:31,760
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

673
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,520
Detail, attention.

674
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,520
Present arms.

675
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,759
Ready, aim, fire.

676
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,760
