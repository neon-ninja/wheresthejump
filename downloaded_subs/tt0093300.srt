1
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,439
Stop that!

2
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,324
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.

3
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,365
Ow!
Serves you right.

4
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:57,955
Will you cut that out?
I can't help myself.

5
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,409
You're as sneaky
as your father was.

6
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:02,703
He was the tomato thief of all time.

7
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:05,330
- I know what you're doing.
- I'm hungry.

8
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:08,503
Let me finish dinner
before you eat it. Chop these.

9
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,506
Sorry, fellas.

10
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:16,514
Oh, Mom, tomorrow night we're going
with Tiffany to buy a Christmas tree.

11
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,432
OK, but a small one.
Watch your fingers.

12
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,687
No way, a big one. Ow! Shit!

13
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,730
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, it adds flavour.

14
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:33,733
- Hello?
- We don't want any.

15
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,067
Thea who?

16
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:38,619
I know it's Thea Brody.
How many grandkids do I have?

17
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:42,366
- 'I can call by myself.'
- I know. You're a big girl.

18
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,500
- 'I'm five now, Grandma.'
- I know you're five.

19
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,122
Hi, kiddo.
How're you doin' down there?

20
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:52,428
'I'm fine, Uncle Sean.
I'm taking swimming lessons.'

21
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:55,142
- 'She swims like a fish.'
- Michael!

22
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,223
- Hey, bro.
- The fish. Check it.

23
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,676
- No way! You check it.
- I'm on the phone.

24
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,941
- 'What's going on? '
- Your grandmother is a slave driver!

25
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,819
- Did you get the book?
- 'Yeah. Thanks! '

26
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:11,607
Ask the big doctor about his job.
Tough life, you Bahamian beach bum.

27
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:12,902
'I heard that.'

28
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,694
- He heard that.
- Good.

29
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:17,698
Hey, how come you get to leave early?

30
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:20,702
Cos my desk is closer to the door.

31
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:24,000
- A big one.
- No, your brother won't be here.

32
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,715
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Jim.

33
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:30,005
- Eggnog time Thursday night!
- We'll be there.

34
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,337
We are getting a big tree
for all the old ornaments...

35
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:38,014
- With stockings on the mantle...
- And cookies and beer for Santa.

36
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:42,471
All right! Tiffany, do you realise
what a madman you're marrying?

37
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,480
Yes, I do.

38
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,066
- I gotta check in.
- OK.

39
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:48,481
- See you. Love you.
- Bye. Me, too.

40
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:50,900
- Don't be late!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:58,035
That bad, huh?

42
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,409
We're out of decaf,
petty cash and requisition forms.

43
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,083
Anything to do before I go?

44
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,164
That man keeps calling
about his training film.

45
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:10,000
He won't believe
we don't have a SWAT team.

46
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,881
Good night, Polly!

47
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,967
Amity Police Department.

48
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,425
Hold it!

49
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,387
There's an old dock piling
in the channel.

50
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:25,268
Maybe it'll just keep on
drifting till it goes away?

51
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:29,181
- It's stuck on a channel marker.
- Good night, Polly.

52
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:33,565
Uh-huh. It... Hold it!

53
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:40,532
It has to be cleared
before the fishermen come back.

54
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,909
Where's Lenny?

55
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:45,248
Out to Ben Master's place.
Cow tipping.

56
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:46,579
Cow tipping?

57
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:52,167
Says kids tip over his sleeping cows.
They're not givin' milk.

58
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:55,094
OK, I'll take care of it.

59
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:58,172
Deputy Brody will
take care of it personally.

60
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:00,844
Call home, tell 'em I'll be late.

61
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:04,510
- Uh-huh.
- Cow tipping!

62
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:08,227
# The first Noel

63
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:12,058
# The angels did say

64
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,811
# Was to certain poor shepherds

65
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,486
# In fields as they lay... #

66
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,985
- No, no, no, no! Hold it!

67
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:27,244
Hold it! Together, people!
Together, remember?

68
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:31,837
All right. Let's try it again.
Two, three.

69
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,294
Where the hell are the Wise Men?

70
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,337
Good luck, Harry.

71
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:42,224
I'm gonna need it with this bunch.

72
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:45,183
Sounds better than
when I was a shepherd.

73
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:48,063
Joseph,
where the hell is your robe?

74
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:51,023
You're supposed to be
in costume! Jesus!

75
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,439
I'm over here!

76
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:32,604
All right, clear quickly.
Ready, angels, and...

77
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:24,864
Very good, people. Very good.
And now, again, "Noel," everyone.

78
00:08:58,193 --> 00:08:59,735
Oh, God!

79
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:08,033
Oh, God! Help!

80
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,205
Help me!

81
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,874
Oh, God! Help me!

82
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:43,122
His things.
I thought you'd want them.

83
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:04,943
Grandma! Grandma!

84
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,159
We're here!

85
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:15,028
Grandma?

86
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,664
- Mom?
- We're here.

87
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,161
Thea, get down here. Come on.

88
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,171
Anybody home?

89
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,179
Michael.

90
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:33,131
Where's Mom?

91
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:36,136
She's been out there for hours.

92
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:38,855
How's she doing?

93
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,856
We've just come from Tiffany's house.

94
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,858
Poor girl.
The doctors had to sedate her.

95
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,743
- Hello, Mrs Taft.
- Hi, sweetheart.

96
00:11:55,788 --> 00:12:00,248
I didn't recognise you, Thea.
You're so grown up.

97
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,962
Uncle Sean is dead, you know.

98
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:06,953
- Will he ever come back?
- We'll talk about that more later.

99
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,751
Are you hungry?

100
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,256
I had a hamburger
on the plane.

101
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:16,012
We can do better than that.
How about a funny bone sandwich?

102
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:23,097
How was the aeroplane ride?
Good. I got two lollipops.

103
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:51,747
- It came for him.
- What?

104
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:55,337
It waited all this time,
and it came for him.

105
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:08,814
You guys must be starving.
I'll make some fettuccini.

106
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:12,312
I'm making dinner.
You should sit and relax.

107
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:15,448
Really, Ellen,
there's nothing left to do.

108
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:24,372
I want you to get out of the water.

109
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:25,699
What?

110
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:28,504
I want you to give up
that terrible job!

111
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:31,003
- You can't be serious.
- Damn right.

112
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,291
I'm just getting started.

113
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:37,887
- I don't want you near the water.
- Mom, you're upset.

114
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:41,218
I don't want my family
anywhere near the water again.

115
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:44,637
- Never!
- You can't believe that voodoo.

116
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,061
Sharks don't pick people to murder.

117
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,859
It picked out Sean.
It killed your father.

118
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:53,152
- Dad died from a heart attack.
- He died from fear.

119
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:55,604
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

120
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,447
There's never been a great white
where we live, ever.

121
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:02,329
It's warm water. They don't like it.

122
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:05,289
Your brother's dead.
Your father's dead.

123
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:17,883
It was a piece of wood!
It was a shitty piece of wood!

124
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:19,880
Michael!

125
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:26,187
He was just doing his job.

126
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:32,860
God, he could make me laugh
sometimes.

127
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:36,022
He was always taggin' after me
when we were kids.

128
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:38,528
He always wanted to do
what I was...

129
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:43,740
Hey, where are you going?

130
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,244
Nowhere!

131
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:02,130
"To everything
there is a season,

132
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:06,435
"and a time to every purpose
under heaven.

133
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,352
"A time to be born
and a time to die.

134
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:14,356
"A time to plant,

135
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:18,235
"and a time to pluck up
that which is planted.

136
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,358
"A time to kill and a time to heal.

137
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:26,779
'"A time to break down
and a time to build up.

138
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:30,248
'"A time to weep
and a time to laugh.'

139
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:35,667
"A time to mourn and a time to dance.

140
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,385
"A time to cast away stones

141
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:41,344
"and a time
to gather stones together.

142
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,714
"A time to embrace

143
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:48,426
"and a time
to refrain from embracing."

144
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:52,190
Hey, Tom, wait up!

145
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:57,103
Oh, you're gonna spoil her.

146
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:59,272
That's what grandmas are for.

147
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:04,242
Why don't you come down
to the islands with us?

148
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:06,659
- I... I can't do that.
- Come on, Mom.

149
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:09,660
- Get warm, spend time with Thea...
- Yes!

150
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,745
Come here, you.

151
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:20,631
Wanna know what I think?
I think it's a wonderful idea.

152
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:23,464
- Yes.
- Come on, at least consider it.

153
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,633
- Get away. You shouldn't be alone.
- Yes!

154
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:28,307
- Great!
- Yay!

155
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,472
- We can catch the 4.30 ferry.
- Today?

156
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:32,897
- Today.
- No, I can't.

157
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:34,184
Yes, you can.

158
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:43,441
- Swing me, swing me!
- OK, OK.

159
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:46,113
Oh, my back! I can't do this.

160
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:49,328
I'll take her.
Oh, my God, she's too heavy.

161
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,449
Help us, Daddy.

162
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:54,578
OK, here we go. Aeroplane ride.

163
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,008
I know.
I'm gonna throw you overboard.

164
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,186
Oh, look!

165
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,812
Oh, hey,
I always wanted to ride one of those.

166
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,431
No way.
Chicken.

167
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:04,898
Mom always said if God meant us
to ride parachutes for fun,

168
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:07,783
- we'd be born with tickets.
- I never said that.

169
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,869
Yes, you did. August 1977.

170
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:14,079
Where's the lady who brings the soda?

171
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:16,200
They had them on the big plane.

172
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:18,741
There's some coffee in the Thermos.

173
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:21,369
I'm too young for coffee.
Can I drive?

174
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:23,379
Thea!

175
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:27,469
Sometimes Dad puts me in his lap
and lets me steer the Jeep.

176
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:32,423
Sometimes I let interesting people
sit in my lap and steer the plane.

177
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:34,184
- Oh, really?
- Really.

178
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:35,687
- Hoagie?
- Yeah?

179
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:38,766
Jake says you'll have to fly the rest
of your life

180
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,939
to pay off what you lost at craps.

181
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:45,481
Good news travels fast.
I'll get it back next time.

182
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:48,863
How come it bumps up and down
when there's no road?

183
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:50,238
The wind does that.

184
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:55,154
You been to the Bahamas before?

185
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,911
- No.
- First time's the best.

186
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:01,079
Then you know too much
and nothing's the same.

187
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,578
What makes the plane go up and down?

188
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:07,415
Easy. You go like this,
and the houses get bigger.

189
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:13,640
Then you go like this,
and the houses get smaller.

190
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,888
- Do you wanna go for a ride?
- Yes!

191
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:31,442
# And so I'm offering
this simple phrase

192
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:36,071
# To kids from one to 92

193
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:39,705
# Although it's been said

194
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,538
# Many times, many ways

195
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:45,541
# Merry Christmas

196
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,632
# To you #

197
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,257
Kenny and Tamika are playing
on the dock. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

198
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:02,055
Everybody out!

199
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:06,816
- Come on.
- Kenny, Tamika! I'm back! I'm home!

200
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:09,648
Let me help you
with the bags there, Romeo.

201
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:12,698
- You can take the heavy ones.
- Thanks, buddy.

202
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:16,491
Grandma! Grandma!

203
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,781
Your room's in here.

204
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,916
Grandma, watch me! Grandma!

205
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,452
Thea! Get down from there!

206
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,624
- Grandma, watch me!
- Get down from there!

207
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:31,423
- Mommy lets me.
- It's too dangerous! Don't do that!

208
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,719
- Grandma, watch me!
- Come on, sweetheart.

209
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,887
But you always let me.

210
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,973
Not today. Come on, Thea.

211
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:42,020
The other kids are.

212
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:44,305
Daddy, why can't I?

213
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:49,103
Did you hear what I said?
Come inside the house right now!

214
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:53,531
- I don't want to. I wanna swing.
- Right now you have to unpack.

215
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:58,117
I didn't mean to start all this.
I feel like such a grandma.

216
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:01,496
Come on. I'll show you around.

217
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,457
No! No! Put me down!

218
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:07,706
- Will you stop making a scene?
- I wanna swing!

219
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:12,833
I'll be all right, Michael.

220
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:15,009
Good. So will I.

221
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:26,140
She calls it
"Tourist on the Loose".

222
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:30,140
The local government commissioned it
for the public beach.

223
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:34,027
- You forgot about the store.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

224
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:36,197
We need milk, bread...

225
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:38,656
There's a big unveiling ceremony.

226
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:41,989
- We need beer!
- OK, I'll be right there!

227
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:45,240
Pretty good, huh?

228
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:48,787
Yeah.

229
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:39,421
Grandma?

230
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:04,620
'Will you stop fartin' around?

231
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:07,914
'Michael, what the hell
you doin' down there, eh? '

232
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,913
Jake, stop bustin' my chops.

233
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:13,631
'Listen, you remember
what they look like?

234
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:16,460
'Hard on the outside,
chewy on the inside.

235
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:19,173
'Sometimes they come
with a little grime.

236
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:20,763
'Move your ass, man! '

237
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:23,011
Ah, bingo!

238
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:26,517
Good. How many you got?

239
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:30,641
Come on, Michael, talk to me.
Give me some numbers. How many?

240
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:33,269
- 'Leave me alone.'
- You're full of shit.

241
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:37,860
'You been down there all day,
nothin' to show but excuses.

242
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:40,989
'Michael,
you're taggin' the damn things.'

243
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:44,409
I gotta separate the ladies
from the gentlemen first.

244
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:50,041
No, man, don't. You move too slow.
You got two speeds - slow and slower.

245
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:52,871
Hold your water, Jake.
The females have eggs.

246
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,290
So we're gonna stop everything
and pass out cigars?

247
00:23:56,341 --> 00:24:00,469
We're being paid to see
where they go, how they propagate.

248
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:05,469
If we had decent funding, I'd study
their motor systems, temperature...

249
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:10,094
We'd do a decent report for a change
and really give them something.

250
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:13,645
If you'd leave me alone,
I'd be able to do my work.

251
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:16,147
I know how to tag a damn conch.

252
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:19,194
- Your readings suck, man.
- The tags suck.

253
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:22,488
- No, it's I that made them.
- It's I that put 'em on.

254
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,487
- You put 'em on wrong.
- No, no, no! They leak!

255
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:27,825
A blind man could find more conch!

256
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:30,707
You can't find your ass
with both hands!

257
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:37,038
That's not fair! You go away, come
back a zombie, it's Christmas Eve.

258
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:39,759
- We're working overtime cos of YOU!
- Hey!

259
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:47,840
I'm sorry about your brother, man.

260
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:53,063
Well, just...
just take it easy, will ya?

261
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:00,104
Jake.

262
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,242
C'mon, Jake, don't...
I don't want...

263
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:10,283
- Oh! Put me down.
- I missed you, man!

264
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:14,459
And then he wrote dirty words
all over the garage.

265
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:17,953
He was... your daddy was five.
He was your age.

266
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:20,128
- I'm almost six.
- So is Jake.

267
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:24,961
Oh, look at that face.
OK, do the other one.

268
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:30,298
Now that's closer to the real truth.

269
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:34,480
Oh, you. This guy was always
getting into some sort of mischief.

270
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:36,562
I got no doubt about that.

271
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:40,357
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?
Did you ever spank him?

272
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:48,402
Sharp shirt, Jake.

273
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:51,703
Hey, may your sex life
be as busy as your shirt.

274
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:54,119
Why, thank you.

275
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,325
My tea set! I got my tea set!

276
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:58,251
Oh, let me see!

277
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:01,711
Every lovely lady
should have a tea set.

278
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:04,711
It has a teapot
and cups and saucers.

279
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:07,796
And a sugar bowl
and a creamer.

280
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:12,176
Can I put real tea in it?
Yes, real tea.

281
00:26:12,226 --> 00:26:15,477
Can I make sandwiches?
Yes.

282
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:18,855
Thea, we forgot
the Christmas carols.

283
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,727
Carol from the grocery store?
Oh, will you stop it?

284
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:32,704
I miss him, Mom.

285
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:39,626
- I want you to change your work.
- Mom, please don't start that.

286
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,419
- You could teach or write...
- I'm not gonna quit now.

287
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:53,172
You're all I have left. I don't want
you working in the water.

288
00:26:56,813 --> 00:27:01,521
Mom, what I do is perfectly safe.

289
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:06,026
At the moment,
we're collecting big snails.

290
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:12,402
Jake and I are scientists.
We're almost PhDs.

291
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:16,036
We know what we're doing.
There's nothing to worry about.

292
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,093
Oh, great.

293
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,396
And, well, we have to dig
the ditch really deep...

294
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:46,604
so the water'll go all the way
around and we can swim in it.

295
00:27:46,653 --> 00:27:49,062
You're silly.

296
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:53,028
You know what? Let's pretend
this is Buckingham Palace.

297
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:57,405
And you'll be Princess Di,
and we'll have a parade with horses.

298
00:27:57,455 --> 00:28:00,493
And you'll ride in a golden carriage,
and we'll...

299
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:04,078
And I can invite
Cinderella to the ball.

300
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,713
She'll come
in a golden carriage, too.

301
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:11,673
And we can have
cookies and punch and cake.

302
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:15,054
And I can invite
Prince Charlie and...

303
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,673
What's the name
of the other prince?

304
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:27,941
Grandma? Grandma?

305
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:29,529
What's wrong?

306
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,529
Nothing.

307
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:36,070
Oh, we better get this done
before the tide comes in.

308
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,361
It's not nice to be evasive.

309
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:41,949
My mother says that
to my father all the time.

310
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,042
Hello, you two!

311
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:46,665
Hello.

312
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,292
I don't know why I fish here.

313
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:55,175
I never catch anything.

314
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:59,719
There must be a sign underwater -
"beware, Hoagie's about".

315
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:03,719
- You drive the plane.
- Flies the plane.

316
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:06,893
Mostly, it's like driving.

317
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,935
What's that, an excavation?

318
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:12,272
We're building a sand castle,
and you're invited for tea.

319
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:14,564
You know why you got
no ambition?

320
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:20,198
- Why is that, Jake?
- Your Norman Rockwell life.

321
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:21,742
Norman Rockwell?

322
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,542
That's precisely
your problem, my friend.

323
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:27,159
You weren't exactly a deprived kid.

324
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:30,711
I don't buy that
roots-rock-reggae bullshit.

325
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:33,878
Cut that hair,
you're a three-piece suit.

326
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:38,055
The bottom line is we got three
months left of work and no money.

327
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:39,509
Spent it all on beer.

328
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:44,184
Bahamian Fisheries Department
is not exactly Fort Knox, my friend.

329
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,104
But, on the other hand,

330
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:49,849
Office of Naval Research,
they've got money.

331
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:51,895
No. Forget it.

332
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:54,152
What do you mean? Money is money.

333
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:59,074
- They put bombs on dolphins.
- What you talking about?

334
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,074
I know a guy who got money
from them to study eels.

335
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:04,827
It's hard to put a bomb
on an eel!

336
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,282
Who rattled your cage? Michael, man!

337
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:10,835
We're bustin' our bunghies
to get our degrees.

338
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:13,289
I'm tired of all this paradise shit.

339
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:15,631
It's getting on my last nerve, man.

340
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:17,966
William. Look at you, boy.

341
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:20,683
- What?
- A mental midget reading all day.

342
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:24,389
If mediocrity were fattening,
you'd all be whales.

343
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,014
Knock off that drummin'!

344
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:29,728
Look at you, boy.
What's wrong with you?

345
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:34,104
You think because you been to
university you're smart?

346
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:37,820
I don't know
why I've told you all this.

347
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,283
Sometimes talking
to a stranger is easier.

348
00:30:41,328 --> 00:30:44,947
I can't explain it.
It's just something I feel.

349
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,118
I always listen to my feelings.

350
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:56,626
I think I'm going crazy.
Nightmares and...

351
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,752
Maybe it was an accident.

352
00:30:58,804 --> 00:31:00,632
It was no accident.

353
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:02,590
I'm not saying you're wrong.

354
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:06,426
I'm just saying that maybe
there are other possibilities.

355
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:10,346
When it killed Sean, I knew
with certainty it had come for him.

356
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,273
I knew that!

357
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:13,895
I know it's coming.

358
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:18,145
I know it's coming.

359
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,524
What's it cost to ride on that plane?

360
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:25,828
The water's coming in!
The water's coming in!

361
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:28,827
Depends on where you want to go.

362
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:31,415
- Doesn't matter.
- Hurry!

363
00:31:31,463 --> 00:31:34,795
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

364
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,838
Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Oh!

365
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:43,180
Take the wheel!
I'm sorry?

366
00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:46,390
- Take the wheel.
- No, I can't.

367
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:48,843
- Sure, you can.
- I don't know how.

368
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:51,648
Nobody does till they learn.

369
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:55,770
What are you doing?

370
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:58,986
Better take the wheel
or we'll be swimming soon.

371
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:01,902
Whoa, take it easy!
Take it easy!

372
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:05,201
Hold her gently.
She'll damn near fly herself.

373
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,869
See? Just like driving a car.

374
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,912
Where do I pull off the road?

375
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:20,045
No, you're doing fine.
I'll keep you out of trouble.

376
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:23,049
- Relax.
- Where are we going?

377
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:26,133
One time, I was flying supplies
up the Amazon

378
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:28,260
when I came down in the jungle.

379
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:31,264
- You won't tell me?
- I was picked up by head-hunters,

380
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:32,890
and taken to their chief.

381
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,396
- You are impossible!
- He looked at me

382
00:32:35,443 --> 00:32:37,434
and took me in his hut.

383
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:40,571
Inside his hut,
there was a long pole...

384
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:56,788
What is all this?

385
00:32:56,838 --> 00:33:00,457
Just a little something
I arranged to cheer you up.

386
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:02,050
- No, really.
- What?

387
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,297
- Tell me, what is all this?
- A local festival.

388
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:08,716
It's called a junkanoo.

389
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:12,432
'I'm not hearing
anything up here, buddy.'

390
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:16,394
How many have you tagged, exactly?
How many?

391
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:20,820
Michael... stop busting my bunghie.

392
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:24,480
Yeah, it's OK for you,
but not for me, huh?

393
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:26,906
Have no fear, Jake is here.

394
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:29,953
I just struck the mother lode.
I'm counting.

395
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:34,041
'Watch yourself with
that fancy equipment, buddy.'

396
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:37,204
Such a live wire'll
make your hair stick up funny.

397
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:39,460
That's good, Michael. William?

398
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:41,831
Yeah, there's no hope for that boy.

399
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:45,419
Jake? Jake, that's a joke.

400
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:49,758
Holy shit!

401
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:56,763
We got a big fish down here, man.

402
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:59,187
Oh, yeah? How big?

403
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:05,103
- Jesus!
- Look out!

404
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:10,530
What's wrong?

405
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:15,791
Ellen?

406
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:21,999
Jesus Christ!

407
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:30,675
- Ellen, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine.

408
00:34:30,724 --> 00:34:33,476
- No, you're not.
- I'm terrific.

409
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:43,314
Come on!

410
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:48,064
Give it up!

411
00:34:48,117 --> 00:34:50,274
You can't keep doing this.

412
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:54,574
- I can't keep doing THIS.
- You promised me a drink.

413
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:59,166
Sharks come and go, Ellen.
People have nothing to do with it.

414
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:04,288
- A drink with an umbrella in it.
- Ellen, give it up.

415
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,507
Give it a kick in the arse.

416
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,592
Get on with your life.

417
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:19,597
I know what you've been through.

418
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:22,601
Don't worry.
The nightmares'll go away.

419
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:29,693
Give me my glasses, man.

420
00:35:29,742 --> 00:35:33,359
Boy, I ain't never seen
nothin' so big. Never!

421
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:37,030
I was right next to Michael.
The thing went right past me!

422
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:39,999
Should've gone for you, Jake.
Why did it come up?

423
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:43,458
- What's it doing in warm water?
- What's the difference?

424
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:47,545
It's only a shark.
A big, big, beautiful shark.

425
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:50,510
And it's ours.
Don't say anything to anyone.

426
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:55,845
Fishermen would try to kill it.
Michael, we got us a great white.

427
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:58,135
Now we gonna do some real research.

428
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:02,136
Do me a favour, don't say
anything about this to my mom.

429
00:36:04,276 --> 00:36:08,060
Hey, man, I didn't mean to,
you know, flap my lips, eh?

430
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:34,301
So...
So?

431
00:36:34,347 --> 00:36:38,475
I said to him,
"Where's the disinfectant?"

432
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:44,806
He said, "I've left it in town."

433
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:47,694
So I said,
"What are we gonna do?"

434
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:51,152
So he says,
"I'll tell you what we'll do.

435
00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:55,527
"Come back at lunchtime, all the
flies will be in the kitchen."

436
00:36:58,038 --> 00:37:00,707
Come to bed.

437
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,041
He took her sightseeing.

438
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:07,707
Well, you work. I work.

439
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:11,753
She needs someone to help her
take her mind off things.

440
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:29,314
I'll help you take YOUR mind
off things, sailor.

441
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:43,407
It's soaking.

442
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:47,628
Thank you.

443
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:52,964
Good night.

444
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,381
Good night.

445
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:22,491
Louisa.

446
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:25,327
It's OK, Jake.
I'll check on the table.

447
00:38:27,336 --> 00:38:31,250
- OK, everything rides.
-Ooh, it's Hoagie!

448
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:33,539
Hey, come on, I wanna see this.

449
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:35,750
Oh, that's Hoagie, all right.

450
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:41,928
Everything on the line.

451
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:45,141
- You're not betting it all?
- All or nothing at all.

452
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:48,188
- Here, do you want to throw for me?
- No!

453
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:50,472
Now get ready. Are you ready?

454
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:07,282
- I guess that's bad?
- Depends on your point of view.

455
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:10,417
Ooh, look at that. Come here.

456
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:13,421
Ooh, look at you. You look great!

457
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,337
It's on the house.

458
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:20,090
I knew there was a reason
I could afford this.

459
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:21,548
Thank you, Shirley!

460
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:26,058
My father used to say, "Jake,
you got two loves in your life -

461
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:28,808
"what you do and who you're with."

462
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,890
- Happy birthday, Louisa.
- Happy birthday!

463
00:39:33,943 --> 00:39:37,146
- And a Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year!

464
00:39:37,196 --> 00:39:40,151
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

465
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,773
Don't go weak in the knees
on me tonight, boy.

466
00:39:42,828 --> 00:39:45,578
You're gonna need
all the strength you got.

467
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:47,781
I knew a one-armed piano player,

468
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,537
took two minutes
to play the Minute Waltz.

469
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:56,704
Watch how you talk.
Michael and I are about to be famous.

470
00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:58,087
- Tell 'em.
- Jake!

471
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:00,376
No job talk. You promised.

472
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:02,669
You promised.

473
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,964
Right.

474
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:07,507
Would you risk
a dance with me, madam?

475
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,144
- You'll be sorry.
- So will you. I have two right feet.

476
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,514
That's good, I have two left.

477
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:15,145
Well, that's a set.

478
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:30,571
A little quiet tonight.

479
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,163
- New Year's blues?
- No, not at all.

480
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:36,414
Come on. It's my party.

481
00:40:36,464 --> 00:40:41,043
He's just Michael, he's startin' to
count them damn conch in his sleep.

482
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:43,881
Excuse me.

483
00:40:55,149 --> 00:40:57,475
- Mind if I cut in?
- Please.

484
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,769
The world would be a better place

485
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:02,443
if more sons danced
with their mothers.

486
00:41:08,538 --> 00:41:11,112
Michael, stop pouting.

487
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:16,077
You look like you did when you were
six and didn't get what you wanted.

488
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:19,165
I like him. I enjoy his company.

489
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:23,509
Yeah. I don't like him
chasing around after you.

490
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:25,878
I don't trust him.

491
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:29,554
He's not chasing.
You are being ridiculous.

492
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,518
I've been a pain in the ass
and I'm sorry.

493
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:35,266
I'm not gonna bother you
about your work.

494
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:37,806
- You're not a pain.
- Let me finish.

495
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:40,473
I've been rehearsing this all day.

496
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:44,188
Sean's death almost killed me.
I'll never get over it,

497
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,525
but I refuse to let myself
be run by an obsession.

498
00:41:47,576 --> 00:41:50,827
I can't keep on believing
it was intentional.

499
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:54,075
I finally figured it out.

500
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,165
Good.

501
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:57,919
That's it, "good"?

502
00:41:57,963 --> 00:42:00,917
I thought you'd break out
the champagne.

503
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:03,373
No, I-I-I'm pleased.

504
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:07,340
Come on. Show your mother
what a good dancer you are.

505
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:21,558
Where is everybody?

506
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,818
Down here!

507
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:31,865
- Where is Clarence and William?
- I gave them the day off.

508
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:34,035
What for? We got a job to finish.

509
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:36,489
Why are you making a transmitter?

510
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:38,831
It's all part of the master plan.

511
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:41,168
We're gonna test it out right now.

512
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:45,675
We're gonna learn about
its motor systems, its heart rate.

513
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:51,008
We're going to study
a magnificent animal

514
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:53,726
no one knows that much about.

515
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:58,097
As the sun sets, we bid a
fond farewell to the family of conch.

516
00:42:58,147 --> 00:43:00,721
What the hell
are you talking about?

517
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:05,354
We wrap it up and hand it in.
Why is your heart stronger than mine?

518
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:08,607
We don't write up anything
till we're finished.

519
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:10,817
When I was a boy, my father said,

520
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:14,450
"Never do anything today
you can put off till tomorrow."

521
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:16,828
Them conch gonna be there tomorrow.

522
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:20,326
- When we got the grant, it said...
- No, when I got the grant.

523
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:23,462
- OK, when I signed on, I...
- When I invited you.

524
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:26,714
- We got the grant together.
- When we got it together.

525
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:31,468
We got three months' work left
on this. We can't write a report.

526
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:35,969
Michael, we got a rare bird here.
You know that, huh?

527
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:39,637
Great white don't come down
to the Bahamas, never.

528
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:42,062
Do we let an opportunity
just swim away?

529
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:43,981
My name's on the report.

530
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:48,523
A half-assed job, I don't get
my doctorate and neither do you.

531
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:51,989
I thought we were planning
a rosy future together.

532
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:53,826
So did I.

533
00:43:56,956 --> 00:43:59,114
Hey! Hey!

534
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,242
Michael?

535
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:03,832
Anybody home in there at all?

536
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,213
You better beam down to Earth
with the rest of us.

537
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:11,504
If that shark's still in the water,
it won't be there forever.

538
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:14,674
It's gonna figure out
the water's too warm.

539
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:20,477
Look at me and tell me you don't want
to study that fish as much as I do.

540
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:24,851
Michael? Huh?
This is what we trained for.

541
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:28,152
This is what we studied
them damn books for.

542
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:31,149
Remember,
my name goes on that report, too.

543
00:44:31,198 --> 00:44:34,319
It's as important to me
as it is to you, right?

544
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:37,155
All right,
you like them damn snails?

545
00:44:37,246 --> 00:44:40,615
All right, all right,
I'll make you a deal. Listen.

546
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:43,667
We study that shark,
just for a few days,

547
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:46,284
and it's back
to your lovely snails.

548
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:49,375
Now that's fair, man. That's fair.

549
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:52,675
Come on, indulge me with it, eh?

550
00:44:57,558 --> 00:45:00,131
I don't know shit about electronics.

551
00:45:00,185 --> 00:45:02,677
Boy, you don't know shit
about anything.

552
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,972
It's time you learned.

553
00:45:05,024 --> 00:45:08,108
I'll teach you how to wear your hair,
how to dance.

554
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:10,524
How to box. Come on, follow me.

555
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,776
Get your butt down here, man.

556
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:22,499
This is the third time
you've forgotten to take it out.

557
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:26,160
- I got a lot on my mind.
- You can't remember when they come?

558
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:28,085
My brain is shrinking...

559
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,334
Don't give me that
preoccupied scientist crap.

560
00:45:31,384 --> 00:45:33,756
I'm getting ready
for a big event!

561
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:37,006
I thought artists worked
with their subconscious.

562
00:45:37,056 --> 00:45:39,593
How come it's my responsibility?

563
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:41,266
Because.

564
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:48,396
Oh. OK, now I understand.
All you had to do was explain it.

565
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,726
I take out the garbage... because.

566
00:45:52,779 --> 00:45:55,272
I'm glad we
got that straightened out.

567
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:58,159
We don't have anything
straightened out.

568
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:09,291
You're uptight about something.

569
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,840
What's wrong?

570
00:46:13,885 --> 00:46:17,669
Why should there be anything wrong?
I'm enjoying my day off,

571
00:46:17,722 --> 00:46:22,549
my wife starts yelling at me
about the garbage.

572
00:46:24,479 --> 00:46:26,306
What are we arguing about?

573
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,400
I don't know. I...

574
00:46:34,154 --> 00:46:36,194
I don't know.

575
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,948
Hey.

576
00:46:39,993 --> 00:46:43,908
- No fair, I'm not armed.
- Then don't come any closer.

577
00:46:43,956 --> 00:46:48,997
- Turn it off. Off.
- No. I have work.

578
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:57,926
I've always wanted to make love
to an angry welder.

579
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,802
I've dreamed of nothing else
since I was a small boy.

580
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,434
- Shut the door.
- Uh-huh. Later.

581
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:20,568
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Michael!

582
00:47:20,617 --> 00:47:22,361
Shut the door!

583
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:37,085
You sure you've
done this before?

584
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:41,345
Oh, yeah. Lots of times.
Trust your Uncle Jake, eh?

585
00:47:41,388 --> 00:47:43,844
It's always worked, huh?

586
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:46,512
Well, uh... thus far.

587
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:55,433
OK, take me out.

588
00:47:56,863 --> 00:47:58,772
Little more.

589
00:48:25,014 --> 00:48:27,388
There it is! Comin'! It's comin'!

590
00:48:32,023 --> 00:48:35,390
- You remember how to pull rope, eh?
- Yeah.

591
00:49:15,691 --> 00:49:18,229
Yes! You got him, man!

592
00:49:18,277 --> 00:49:20,400
Ah! Now would be a good time!

593
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:24,862
Did you see that, man?

594
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,907
Let's try to follow it.

595
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:31,530
Now we're gonna see if Uncle Jake's
equipment's really working for us.

596
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,545
Michael!

597
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,470
- Our little island agrees with you.
- I have my own little island.

598
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:56,387
But it's so cold in the winter.
I tried winter once.

599
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,774
Here we are. Burlington, Vermont.

600
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:02,938
I flew a run to New York. Oh!

601
00:50:02,988 --> 00:50:06,737
I have a bone in my left foot
that hasn't thawed yet.

602
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:10,733
- When I was a small boy...
- Not hard to imagine, by the way.

603
00:50:10,787 --> 00:50:13,539
...I dreamed of always being warm.

604
00:50:13,581 --> 00:50:16,452
What do you want?
Whatever we had last time.

605
00:50:16,543 --> 00:50:18,203
Two Bahama Mamas, please.

606
00:50:18,253 --> 00:50:21,871
- Stay. I'll take time off.
- You always take time off.

607
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:24,676
I like to travel.
I'll nick the plane again.

608
00:50:24,718 --> 00:50:28,419
- Won't you get in trouble?
- Not if he doesn't find out.

609
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:33,015
It's just a hop down to the
Caribbean. We'll spend a few days.

610
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,097
There must be a lot of ladies
who'd be glad to go.

611
00:50:36,147 --> 00:50:37,890
Yeah, there are, but...

612
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:42,234
I've grown tired
of one-way conversations.

613
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:49,944
I have an irresistible
urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.

614
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:51,274
Why?

615
00:50:51,328 --> 00:50:54,779
Because it would not
occur to you why.

616
00:50:57,877 --> 00:50:59,619
Blushing suits you.

617
00:50:59,669 --> 00:51:04,794
- Lord... I'm sorry.
- It's nothing to be sorry about.

618
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:09,170
No, this whole thing...
The whole idea is preposterous.

619
00:51:09,221 --> 00:51:11,428
I don't think so.

620
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:16,009
- You sure you don't need glasses?
- I'm a pilot.

621
00:51:16,062 --> 00:51:18,100
My vision is perfect.

622
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:27,318
What are we getting?
Nine knots.

623
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:29,653
Shit! We should be keeping up.

624
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,070
- You sure the throttle's open?
- Wide open.

625
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:38,078
Come on, you overgrown goldfish!
Come to Uncle Jake.

626
00:51:40,169 --> 00:51:43,039
- How long have you known Hoagie?
- What?

627
00:51:43,088 --> 00:51:44,880
How long have you known Hoagie?

628
00:51:44,924 --> 00:51:47,379
- What's he got to do with it?
- How long?

629
00:51:47,426 --> 00:51:49,916
Since he got here.
Bring it to starboard!

630
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:55,224
When did he get here?

631
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:57,306
- Who?
- Hoagie!

632
00:51:57,352 --> 00:51:59,925
Christ!
One day he was just here, that's all.

633
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,432
What do you know about him?

634
00:52:07,278 --> 00:52:08,773
He's after my mother.

635
00:52:08,822 --> 00:52:13,152
- What's so funny?
- He's not good enough for her, eh?

636
00:52:13,202 --> 00:52:16,037
I agree. I'd send her home right now.

637
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,452
Bring her about,
we're going the wrong way.

638
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:22,117
I mean, some of these pilots
are flying drugs down here.

639
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:25,788
- He's always going off somewhere.
- Bring her about, now!

640
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,754
- I am!
- Hurry, man, we're losin' him!

641
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:32,209
- You must know something.
- Christ!

642
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:35,678
He likes gambling,
he likes women, don't bother me!

643
00:52:35,724 --> 00:52:38,132
- He flies charter...
- Damn! We lost him!

644
00:52:40,312 --> 00:52:42,304
Maybe your gear crapped out.

645
00:52:42,355 --> 00:52:46,104
Maybe you crapped out,
flappin' your lips about Hoagie.

646
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:57,244
Maybe he's gone.

647
00:52:59,998 --> 00:53:02,834
All right, Mr Fish.

648
00:53:02,877 --> 00:53:05,546
We'll come back and find you
tomorrow.

649
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:18,096
All he did was kiss me!

650
00:53:18,184 --> 00:53:22,097
- Well, that's a beginning.
- A beginning of what?

651
00:53:22,145 --> 00:53:24,719
To whatever happens next.

652
00:53:24,773 --> 00:53:26,682
Oh.

653
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:30,897
I used to think I could handle these
situations once I was grown up,

654
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:33,483
but I don't even know
if he's serious.

655
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:37,150
Mmm, give it some time, Ellen.
See what happens.

656
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:40,784
Well, part of me wanted to
go off with him.

657
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,491
I couldn't.

658
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:47,999
I don't know why he wants me.

659
00:53:48,046 --> 00:53:49,754
Maybe he's got good taste.

660
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:52,835
He hasn't spent
much time with a woman like you.

661
00:53:52,885 --> 00:53:57,179
I don't know what he thinks.
Or what I think. This is so silly!

662
00:53:57,223 --> 00:53:59,714
I feel too old to be in this thing.

663
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:03,266
I hope not. I am counting on
a long, happy sex life.

664
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:11,895
You said it wasn't polite
to interrupt people.

665
00:54:13,238 --> 00:54:14,862
Yes, I did.

666
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:18,490
- It's time for tea, Grandma.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

667
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:21,156
I didn't.
I put everything in my room.

668
00:54:21,204 --> 00:54:23,328
My teddy bear's joining us.

669
00:54:33,842 --> 00:54:35,633
Michael?

670
00:54:35,677 --> 00:54:40,007
Michael, what is it?

671
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:43,514
Nothing, just a stupid dream.

672
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:47,930
Hmm.

673
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,394
Time for bed, peanut.

674
00:56:56,442 --> 00:56:59,147
- Oh, no!
- Yep. Daddy's got homework.

675
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:01,686
- But you let me last night.
- Yeah, yeah.

676
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:03,981
Mommy's waiting to read a story.

677
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:08,204
- Good night, sweetheart!
- Good night.

678
00:57:08,246 --> 00:57:11,496
Night. Let's put up our feet
and shoot the breeze,

679
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,949
or whatever it is beer drinkers do.

680
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:16,871
I, uh, I got to put
together this report, Ma.

681
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,337
Jake says don't do today
what you can put off tomorrow.

682
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,004
Yeah, Jake's got a lot of those.

683
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:27,133
I'm leaving in a few days.
I don't want to go with you unhappy.

684
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:28,556
I'm not unhappy.

685
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:31,767
I saw you and Thea.
You looked just like your father.

686
00:57:31,812 --> 00:57:35,264
Do you remember when
you guys used to imitate him?

687
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:38,730
Mom, I gotta get this finished, OK?

688
00:57:38,776 --> 00:57:42,525
- I worry about you.
- There's nothing to worry about.

689
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:44,530
I'm your mother. It's my job.

690
00:57:44,574 --> 00:57:48,275
Just cos you're a man
doesn't mean I've retired.

691
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:52,408
I've worked on MY smile.
It's... it's your turn.

692
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,454
That's better.

693
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,004
'Blump, blump! Blump, blump!

694
00:58:01,049 --> 00:58:04,334
- 'Blump, blump! Blump, blump! '
- Jake, knock it off!

695
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:08,085
Blump, blump. OK,
just don't try to renege on our deal.

696
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:11,674
Half a day on the snails,
then a half a day on the shark.

697
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:16,354
You got 17 more minutes, then we're
gonna go look for that shark.

698
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:21,060
It's a big ocean. We could
spend the rest of our lives looking.

699
00:58:21,111 --> 00:58:22,819
'We're gonna find him.'

700
00:58:22,863 --> 00:58:26,481
'I got about a half a dozen.
I'll tag 'em and be right up.

701
00:58:26,533 --> 00:58:28,573
'You, uh, hearin' anything? '

702
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:33,115
Nothin' at all. Just another cool,
calm, tickly day in the Bahamas.

703
00:58:33,165 --> 00:58:37,244
Just stay within a quarter mile.
I got a three-mile monitor radius.

704
00:58:37,293 --> 00:58:41,837
Within three miles, there's plenty of
time to beam your ugly ass up.

705
00:58:53,393 --> 00:58:54,721
Michael, I got him.

706
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:58,268
'He's comin' towards you.
You better get out now.'

707
00:58:58,314 --> 00:59:00,721
All right, I'm comin', I'm comin'.

708
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:27,754
Shit!

709
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,304
Jake!

710
00:59:35,226 --> 00:59:37,052
Jake!

711
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:43,100
Michael! Michael!

712
00:59:44,903 --> 00:59:46,895
'Michael! '

713
00:59:51,617 --> 00:59:55,864
Michael, what's goin' on?
Michael, can you hear me?

714
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:02,161
'Michael! Michael, can you hear me? '

715
01:00:29,613 --> 01:00:31,523
Michael!

716
01:01:45,314 --> 01:01:48,186
Son of a bitch! Oh, shit!

717
01:01:48,235 --> 01:01:49,776
Jesus Christ!

718
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:53,697
Ah!

719
01:01:57,995 --> 01:02:00,200
Uh!

720
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:06,666
It's over there!

721
01:02:06,877 --> 01:02:09,334
Shit! Get the bang sticks,
we're goin' down.

722
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:12,049
- They're no good.
- Get another one!

723
01:02:43,747 --> 01:02:46,535
Come on, come on! Michael!

724
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:49,834
- Get him up! Watch his arm!
- Lay him down gently!

725
01:02:49,879 --> 01:02:53,413
We need a tourniquet
to stop his bleeding.

726
01:02:53,466 --> 01:02:56,171
- Try this!
- Get the wet suit off.

727
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:58,544
Keep cool, don't worry.

728
01:02:58,596 --> 01:03:02,546
Michael, how are you?
I think he may be in shock.

729
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,557
Clarence, move it!

730
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:42,633
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what you doin', man?

731
01:03:42,683 --> 01:03:46,430
No one goes in the water
till we know where that fish is.

732
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:49,265
You fall off the horse,
you get right back on.

733
01:03:49,314 --> 01:03:52,563
Hell, what kind of bullcrap
you talkin'? Huh?

734
01:03:52,608 --> 01:03:56,938
- Anybody's in the water, it's me.
- Jake, I'm gonna go down.

735
01:03:56,988 --> 01:04:02,030
All right, so what about Carla's gig?
It's almost time, man.

736
01:04:06,664 --> 01:04:09,664
Michael, I can't just let you
go back down.

737
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:13,961
I'm scared shitless.

738
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:17,588
What the hell do I do
if I can't go back in that water?

739
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:22,088
All right, be careful.

740
01:04:35,277 --> 01:04:38,977
Clarence, get up on that shack.
Give us some lookout.

741
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:43,526
- I hope he knows what he's doing.
- He's doin' what he's got to do.

742
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:02,045
Jake, are you gettin'
anything on the shark?

743
01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:09,256
No, everything's cool.

744
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:12,809
I'm thinkin' about yesterday.
It's probably a mistake.

745
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:16,723
- He was hungry. You look tasty.
- But how come only me?

746
01:05:16,776 --> 01:05:21,354
- Maybe he just like white meat.
- You're a funny guy, Jake.

747
01:05:25,118 --> 01:05:26,493
Jesus!

748
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:42,960
It is about art
that I wish to speak today.

749
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:48,761
The raw material of art
surrounds us all,

750
01:05:48,807 --> 01:05:53,137
catching in the net that each
and every one of us casts

751
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:55,641
into the current of life.

752
01:05:57,066 --> 01:06:00,565
- But it takes the art...
- Where the hell are they?

753
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:02,403
They'll be here.

754
01:06:02,446 --> 01:06:04,688
- Can I go on the banana boat?
- Shh!

755
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,074
Margaret's going.
She's with her mother.

756
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:10,526
- OK.
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

757
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:13,414
- Thea, you be careful.
- I will, I will!

758
01:06:13,457 --> 01:06:16,661
- Thea!
- It's OK. Banana boats are fun.

759
01:06:17,753 --> 01:06:22,048
Oh, we should be so lucky.
I wish we were out with her playin'.

760
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:24,416
Margaret, wait for me!

761
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:29,047
"Get to the point, man,"
as my wife now says.

762
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:36,971
OK. Well, in short, art is grease
for the wheel of life.

763
01:06:37,021 --> 01:06:43,392
Today we are privileged
to dedicate a work of art.

764
01:06:43,445 --> 01:06:45,189
Carla Brody,

765
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:50,197
an artist of growing reputation,

766
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:56,614
was commissioned to express
our way of life in permanent form...

767
01:06:56,667 --> 01:07:00,368
to show the world what we all know
right here on this beach:

768
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:03,376
That it is better in the Bahamas.

769
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:11,639
- Absolutely.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Carla Brody!

770
01:07:11,682 --> 01:07:15,596
Thank you, Commissioner Witherspoon,
Mrs Witherspoon.

771
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:25,021
Thea!

772
01:07:31,827 --> 01:07:33,321
Oh, my God!

773
01:07:35,872 --> 01:07:37,153
Thea!

774
01:07:40,002 --> 01:07:43,206
Stop! Come back! Bring her back!

775
01:07:45,425 --> 01:07:46,753
Oh, my God!

776
01:08:01,607 --> 01:08:04,393
Stop! Thea! Thea!

777
01:08:04,442 --> 01:08:05,772
Thea!

778
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,061
Somebody do something!

779
01:08:13,035 --> 01:08:14,315
Thea!

780
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:21,834
Oh, no! My God!

781
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:36,221
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Thea!

782
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:41,762
Somebody get a doctor!
Get a doctor now!

783
01:08:41,815 --> 01:08:43,771
Quickly!

784
01:09:49,465 --> 01:09:52,798
- I'm sorry I missed you.
- Where have you been?

785
01:09:52,843 --> 01:09:54,919
What's the matter? What happened?

786
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:57,093
Thea was attacked by a shark.

787
01:09:57,139 --> 01:09:59,131
Oh, my God.

788
01:10:00,225 --> 01:10:03,226
The doctor said she should be OK.
She's in shock.

789
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:07,101
Sweetheart? Sweetheart?

790
01:10:07,148 --> 01:10:10,185
I'm so sorry.
I should've known. Jesus.

791
01:10:10,277 --> 01:10:12,186
Should've known what?

792
01:10:15,824 --> 01:10:18,493
- We tried to keep track of him.
- Of...

793
01:10:18,535 --> 01:10:20,494
The shark.

794
01:10:20,538 --> 01:10:23,207
- You knew?
- Yeah. Thought it went away.

795
01:10:23,248 --> 01:10:26,334
- Came after me.
- She could've been killed. You knew?

796
01:10:26,377 --> 01:10:29,543
And you didn't tell us?
You let your mother think...

797
01:10:29,588 --> 01:10:30,833
Where is she?

798
01:10:30,881 --> 01:10:33,633
- How could you do that?
- Where's my mother?

799
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:36,249
- Where's my mother?
- Why didn't you tell us?

800
01:10:36,303 --> 01:10:39,838
- Where's Jake?
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

801
01:10:42,892 --> 01:10:44,767
Michael!

802
01:10:48,273 --> 01:10:49,815
Jake!

803
01:10:49,858 --> 01:10:52,396
- Jake!
- What?

804
01:10:52,444 --> 01:10:54,900
Come on! I need you! Hurry up!

805
01:11:14,925 --> 01:11:17,879
Hoagie! Did you see our boat?

806
01:11:17,928 --> 01:11:20,882
- I just got here.
- My mother took it.

807
01:11:20,931 --> 01:11:24,881
- I hope she's a good sailor.
- A shark attacked Thea.

808
01:11:24,935 --> 01:11:27,011
She went after the damn thing.

809
01:11:27,103 --> 01:11:30,555
- She's gone after it?
- Yeah, we gotta stop her.

810
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:34,521
In that?
Lt'll take all day in that bathtub.

811
01:11:34,569 --> 01:11:35,648
Got a better idea?

812
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:42,200
I'll radio her position.

813
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:45,529
The rescue boats will pick her up,
so don't worry.

814
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,778
She'll be fine.

815
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:49,916
She'll never find that bloody shark.
We couldn't.

816
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,163
It'll find her.
What do you mean?

817
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:56,000
She said it was coming.

818
01:11:56,049 --> 01:11:59,383
- What do you mean?
- What do you know?

819
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:02,843
She thinks the shark
that killed Martin and Sean

820
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:04,550
is following the family.

821
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,968
Hey, he's not talkin'
about our shark, eh?

822
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:11,021
What do you do when
you're not flying people?

823
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:14,061
I deliver laundry.

824
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:18,854
Hold on. What's that?
Let's have a look.

825
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:26,745
Oh.

826
01:12:28,582 --> 01:12:31,073
It's a big ocean out there.

827
01:13:08,997 --> 01:13:11,536
Can't this thing go any faster?

828
01:13:11,584 --> 01:13:14,702
Any faster, this thing'll be
a flying Cuisinart

829
01:13:14,752 --> 01:13:16,829
and we'll be diced into oblivion.

830
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:47,400
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch.

831
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:56,253
There she is.
That's her right there.

832
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:00,373
Is that what I think it is?

833
01:14:02,552 --> 01:14:04,839
- Mom...
- Hold on!

834
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:17,306
Oh!

835
01:14:32,246 --> 01:14:35,995
'Thomas, you there?
This is Zero-Papa-Alpha here.'

836
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:38,284
'Hoagie, where are you? '

837
01:14:38,337 --> 01:14:42,833
12 miles southeast of Emerald Key.
Look for Neptune's Folly.'

838
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:49,468
I need two boats fast and somebody
who can kill a shark - a big one.

839
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:52,717
'What're you doing? '
Practising landing.

840
01:14:52,767 --> 01:14:55,259
Hang on to your socks, lads.

841
01:14:55,312 --> 01:14:57,981
Wait! You sure you know
how to do this?

842
01:14:58,022 --> 01:15:01,723
Of course not!
What kind of pilot do you think I am?

843
01:15:15,874 --> 01:15:17,831
- Christ!
- Hell, not half bad.

844
01:15:17,876 --> 01:15:19,868
Get out, I'll keep it busy.

845
01:15:19,919 --> 01:15:24,083
No, it'll come for the plane's
electromagnetic impulse.

846
01:15:24,132 --> 01:15:26,801
Get the bloody hell out!

847
01:15:26,843 --> 01:15:28,088
Michael!

848
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:44,067
Damn passengers! You're all the same.
Complain, complain...

849
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:45,687
Oh, shit!

850
01:15:48,156 --> 01:15:49,235
Hoagie!

851
01:15:52,202 --> 01:15:55,155
Hoagie! Hoagie!

852
01:16:16,016 --> 01:16:19,053
Why'd you come out here?

853
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:23,976
Why'd you come out here?

854
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:26,267
- Why did you bring him?
- Mom, Mom!

855
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:29,237
- Why'd you take the boat?
- It kept coming!

856
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:32,780
- Didn't you realise?
- There was nothing else to do.

857
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:36,201
- You shouldn't have done it.
- I tried to tell you.

858
01:16:36,246 --> 01:16:38,737
I tried.

859
01:16:43,461 --> 01:16:46,462
Hey!
Give me a hand, for Christ's sake!

860
01:16:46,506 --> 01:16:49,590
- Hoagie!
- How the hell did you do that, man?

861
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:52,551
- It wasn't easy, believe me.
- Get him up.

862
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:58,013
You all right, man?

863
01:16:58,059 --> 01:17:01,427
- Oh! Bloody hell.
- Get it started!

864
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:04,564
- The breath on that thing!
- You are alive!

865
01:17:04,607 --> 01:17:07,144
Let's get out of here,
Ellen Brody. Oh!

866
01:17:07,192 --> 01:17:09,566
Good, this thing's still working.

867
01:17:10,697 --> 01:17:13,069
That's your engine, pal.
I'll have a look.

868
01:17:16,828 --> 01:17:19,117
Oh, shit, he's close, man.

869
01:17:19,164 --> 01:17:22,414
- What is that sound?
- The shark's heartbeat.

870
01:17:22,459 --> 01:17:26,327
Hoagie, try to finish.
Michael, gimme a hand, I got an idea.

871
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:30,459
We're taking water down here.
Ellen, start pumping here.

872
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:34,587
Ellen! Get the bilge pump!

873
01:17:34,638 --> 01:17:39,216
Take the radio transmitter out
and hook it to the strobe.

874
01:17:39,267 --> 01:17:42,849
- We gotta get the engine started!
- Just do it!

875
01:17:42,895 --> 01:17:45,980
We're gonna feed that big boy
a meal he won't forget.

876
01:17:46,024 --> 01:17:50,520
You better have something good going.
We've got a rotten hose.

877
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,985
There's a spare one.
What you wanna do with this?

878
01:17:54,031 --> 01:17:59,274
I'm riggin' the receiver. We get it
inside that bastard and set it off.

879
01:17:59,328 --> 01:18:03,457
I got it. We rig an antenna on this,
we can shock the hell out of him.

880
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,042
Right! You're learning.

881
01:18:08,463 --> 01:18:10,005
He's getting closer!

882
01:18:10,048 --> 01:18:14,876
They spend their lives looking for
food, they don't care what it is.

883
01:18:14,928 --> 01:18:17,882
Maybe he's got indigestion.
He's eaten my plane!

884
01:18:19,933 --> 01:18:22,139
It's not food he's after.

885
01:18:22,185 --> 01:18:25,139
Michael, turn on your switch.
I need a test.

886
01:18:25,188 --> 01:18:28,189
- Anybody tell you you're nuts?
- All the time.

887
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:31,317
If it responds
to external electrical impulse,

888
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:35,227
it might respond to one inside -
confuse him, drive him crazy.

889
01:18:35,281 --> 01:18:38,033
OK, a test... Good.

890
01:18:42,038 --> 01:18:45,905
You'd better get up here!
The heartbeat's stopped!

891
01:18:51,588 --> 01:18:53,249
Shit.

892
01:18:53,299 --> 01:18:56,964
Either he's gone
or your gear's crapped out again.

893
01:18:58,055 --> 01:19:02,467
That's bull. My equipment
don't crap out. He'll be back.

894
01:19:02,517 --> 01:19:05,304
Get me the boat hook.

895
01:19:05,353 --> 01:19:10,145
Maybe he had a heart attack.
Humans are full of cholesterol.

896
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:12,350
- Give me that.
- Shit! Where is he?

897
01:19:14,487 --> 01:19:17,524
Give me that line, Michael.
Right there.

898
01:19:18,617 --> 01:19:20,110
There he is!

899
01:19:22,036 --> 01:19:24,610
Ellen, try the engine.

900
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:28,405
Ellen! Try to start the engine!

901
01:19:33,255 --> 01:19:36,375
Son of a bitch.
Let's get out of here.

902
01:19:36,425 --> 01:19:40,637
No, it's too late, Hoagie.
Give me a hard port.

903
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,471
Right!

904
01:19:42,515 --> 01:19:47,391
Here, give me that.
No! No time for that!

905
01:19:47,437 --> 01:19:50,521
Jake! You can't go out there
without a line!

906
01:19:53,276 --> 01:19:56,111
Keep it steady.
It's gonna come back!

907
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:16,755
Damn thing's disappeared. He's gone!

908
01:20:53,545 --> 01:20:59,997
Jake!

909
01:21:28,162 --> 01:21:31,447
We're taking too much water.
It'll stop the engine.

910
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,666
Ellen, take the wheel.
We've got to outrun it. Ellen!

911
01:21:51,769 --> 01:21:55,601
- That thing gonna work?
- It'll work.

912
01:21:55,648 --> 01:21:59,064
If Jake says so, it will.
This charge will drive it crazy.

913
01:23:03,048 --> 01:23:06,252
Sweet Jesus,
we're headed straight for it!

914
01:23:06,302 --> 01:23:08,792
Ellen, come about!

915
01:23:14,852 --> 01:23:18,601
We're gonna hit it!
Hold on!

916
01:23:18,648 --> 01:23:20,190
Hold on!

917
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:23,690
Smile, you son of a bitch!

918
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:51,418
- Michael!
- Come over here.

919
01:23:55,642 --> 01:23:57,100
Michael!

920
01:23:57,143 --> 01:23:59,896
It's all right! I'm OK!

921
01:23:59,938 --> 01:24:03,188
Anybody there? Over here!

922
01:24:06,529 --> 01:24:07,809
Jake!

923
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:13,202
Michael, you got a minute?

924
01:24:13,244 --> 01:24:15,782
It's Jake!

925
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,705
Son of a bitch!

926
01:24:31,637 --> 01:24:33,546
Jesus, Jake.

927
01:24:37,142 --> 01:24:40,974
What took you so damn long, man?

928
01:24:41,021 --> 01:24:43,511
What the hell are you doing alive?

929
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:47,433
I told you Uncle Jake's
equipment don't crap out, eh?

930
01:24:50,281 --> 01:24:54,324
You're not going to do something
stupid like die on me, are you?

931
01:24:54,367 --> 01:24:58,034
No, man. I'm way too mean for that.

932
01:25:05,213 --> 01:25:08,416
So from now on,
we're going to study snails, eh?

933
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:10,126
Yeah.

934
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:17,338
Come to Amity this summer.

935
01:25:17,391 --> 01:25:20,595
We'll be there.
You make sure they come.

936
01:25:20,645 --> 01:25:23,349
I will.
I'll miss you, Grandma.

937
01:25:25,107 --> 01:25:28,143
Get in, Ellen Brody.
You'll miss your plane.

938
01:25:28,193 --> 01:25:30,767
- Goodbye, Grandma!
- OK.

939
01:25:30,863 --> 01:25:33,235
- Be careful.
- OK. See ya.

940
01:25:34,366 --> 01:25:36,822
- Take good care of Jake.
- I will.

941
01:25:38,329 --> 01:25:40,997
You gonna be OK?

942
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:44,159
- Yeah.
- OK.

943
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:48,786
When I come back,
remind me to tell you about the time

944
01:25:48,839 --> 01:25:51,164
I took a hundred nuns to Nairobi.

945
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,673
There they were,
100 nuns, playing guitars

946
01:26:00,726 --> 01:26:04,806
and singing, "The hills are alive
with the sound of music."

947
01:26:04,855 --> 01:26:08,639
Then suddenly,
one comes up to me and she says,

948
01:26:08,693 --> 01:26:11,776
"There's smoke coming
from the engine."

949
01:26:11,821 --> 01:26:14,691
But I never
took them seriously,

950
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,944
until they all started singing
"Nearer My God to Thee."
