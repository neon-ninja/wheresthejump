1
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:25,761
Lullaby and goodnight

2
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:31,441
With roses bedight

3
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:36,961
With lilies o'er spread

4
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:42,961
Is baby's wee bed

5
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:49,041
Tomorrow morn, if God deems

6
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,761
You will wake from your dreams

7
00:00:55,361 --> 00:01:00,841
Tomorrow morn, if God deems

8
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:07,841
You will wake from your dreams

9
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,281
Good night.

10
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:34,801
You're it!

11
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,921
One, two, three, four...

12
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,281
Five!

13
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,641
Lukas?

14
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,281
11, 12

15
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,681
13, 14

16
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,961
15,16

17
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,921
17, 18

18
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:20,201
19, 20...

19
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,001
Lukas?

20
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,481
Lukas?

21
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,441
- Mom?
- Mom?

22
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,121
Mom?

23
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,041
That's a fine hello.

24
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,641
Look at your clothes.

25
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:32,001
Filthy. Take them off right now.

26
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,561
Not here!

27
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,161
Undress by the washing machine.
And then take a shower.

28
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:41,641
Move it!

29
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,161
There you are.

30
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,401
Thanks.

31
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,521
Lukas wants some too.

32
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:40,961
Then he can ask me himself.

33
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:45,361
You only made supper for me.

34
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,441
You know why.

35
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,081
You should apologize.

36
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,081
- Am I a person?
- No.

37
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:25,961
- Am I a thing?
- Yes.

38
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,601
- Am I a cell phone?
- No.

39
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:33,401
- Am I a pair of pants?
- No.

40
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,601
- Can you wear me?
- No.

41
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,081
- Can you eat me?
- No.

42
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:42,801
- Do you need me every clay?
- Yes.

43
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:54,041
- Am I hair?
- No.

44
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,801
It's a thing.

45
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,121
That's needed in daily life.

46
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:02,441
You use it almost every clay.

47
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:04,241
Do I?

48
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:08,161
Not by yourself, but...

49
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,521
- A car?
- Yes, right.

50
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:15,281
You got it.

51
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,641
- Am I an animal?
- No.

52
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,281
- Am I a thing?
- No.

53
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,321
Am I a person?

54
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:42,761
Yes.

55
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,281
- Am I a man?
- No.

56
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,761
- Am I a woman?
- Yes.

57
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,641
- A grown-up?
- Yes.

58
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,801
Am I still alive?

59
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,081
Yes.

60
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,761
Am I on TV?

61
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:00,041
Yes.

62
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,281
Am I...

63
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,281
a TV hostess?

64
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:04,881
Yes.

65
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,361
- Am I on German TV?
- No.

66
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,561
Austrian.

67
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,441
Am I famous?

68
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,801
Well, sort of.

69
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,561
Barbara Karlich?

70
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:25,881
No.

71
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,441
A clue?

72
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,561
You like animals.

73
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,081
You like animals.

74
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,441
Come on!

75
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:58,121
You like animals.

76
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,241
Another clue.

77
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,561
You have two kids.

78
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,681
How do I know who has two kids?
Do I know the person?

79
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:14,801
Yes.

80
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:02,441
Lukas!

81
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,321
That's enough.

82
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:44,801
That's it.

83
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:46,681
- Come on!
- Mom!

84
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:48,281
I have something to say.

85
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:50,201
We were playing!

86
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,441
I don't care.

87
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,121
Dad lets us play.

88
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:55,561
I don't care what your clad does.

89
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:58,201
This is important.

90
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:00,441
I want you to look at me.

91
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:05,121
- So start already.
- Excuse me?

92
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,561
Nothing.

93
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,841
The doctor said I need rest.

94
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:14,681
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.

95
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:18,521
I want absolute quiet in the house.

96
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:21,041
I have to sleep. If it's important,

97
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,481
knock.

98
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:24,801
And no visitors.

99
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,321
If anyone asks,

100
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,921
Mom is ill.

101
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,761
We'll keep the blinds closed.

102
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:32,681
I have to avoid sunlight.

103
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,481
You'll play only in the garden, quietly.

104
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,281
Bring nothing inside.

105
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,641
No branches, no animals...

106
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:41,161
What are you doing?

107
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,321
We'll start over.

108
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:45,881
Right?

109
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,841
We need to hold this family together.

110
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,601
One from me and one from Lukas.

111
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,441
Very nice.

112
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:58,321
I'm serious about what I just said.

113
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:00,561
We won't forget, right?

114
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,441
Good.

115
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,761
It's bedtime now.

116
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,161
Good night.

117
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:22,001
- She's so different.
- Well...

118
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:24,121
It's just the operation.

119
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,321
You think?

120
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:27,961
Yeah.

121
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,441
I don't know.

122
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,921
How would you feel

123
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:36,361
if you'd had an operation like that?

124
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:38,961
I don't know.

125
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,721
She's not like our mom.

126
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,521
Play it again.

127
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,321
I'm giving you lots and lots of kisses.

128
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:00,161
I can't wait until I'm back.

129
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,601
Pull the covers up and close your eyes.

130
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:09,001
Can you count the stars that brightly

131
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,521
Twinkle in the midnight sky?

132
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:16,841
Can you count the clouds, so lightly

133
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:20,401
O'er the meadows floating by?

134
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:24,641
God, the Lord, doth mark their number

135
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,761
With His eyes that never slumber

136
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:32,681
You He sees and you He loves

137
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:37,161
You He sees and you He loves

138
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,681
Good night.

139
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:49,241
Get Mom.

140
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:35,961
Mom?

141
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,401
Lukas?

142
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,041
Lukas?

143
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:09,321
- Hello?
- Hi, good morning.

144
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:14,241
You sure placed a killer order.
So much, all at once.

145
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:17,161
- Someone having a party?
- No.

146
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,521
Who's all this pizza for?

147
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:23,921
Pepperoni, pepperoni?
Is that your favorite?

148
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:28,201
Pepperoni pizza. You must love it.

149
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,041
Yeah.

150
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,281
Bought enough for a year.

151
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:35,481
There we go, it's all in there.

152
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,001
Open up.

153
00:27:57,881 --> 00:27:59,281
What in hell...

154
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,440
Since when do we lock doors?

155
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:03,601
Sorry.

156
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:53,561
Why is there a lighter in here?

157
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:56,201
I wanted to burn some books.

158
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:59,281
Don't act smart.

159
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:14,881
Get off!

160
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:18,081
Let him go!

161
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:22,961
OUR WEDDING

162
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:39,241
FOR SALE: STYLISH RETREAT,
PRICE ON REQUEST

163
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,441
Lukas!

164
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,361
Leg?

165
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:45,841
Time for your chores!

166
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:00,081
Leg?

167
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,241
I've other worries.

168
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:31,081
I won't play along anymore.

169
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:35,201
I have to make him stop.
He has to face it.

170
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,041
Wait a second, sorry.

171
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:09,721
Not here either.

172
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:13,121
Leg?

173
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:27,121
Lukas, look.

174
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:34,921
What's wrong with him?

175
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:38,721
Leg?

176
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,481
I'm sure it was Mom.

177
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:20,841
Well?

178
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:27,161
Fine.

179
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:32,721
Are you crazy?

180
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:35,881
Stop that.

181
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:38,321
What's going on?

182
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:40,241
What is going on?

183
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,281
- We want our mom back.
- What?

184
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,241
We want our mom back.

185
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:47,121
Have you gone crazy?

186
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:50,641
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:53,801
Clean this up and go to your room!

188
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:56,241
You're not our mom.

189
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,441
To your room!

190
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,361
Show us your birthmark.

191
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,681
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.

192
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,161
I've had it.

193
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:11,401
Anything else, maybe?

194
00:42:28,601 --> 00:42:31,241
I want you to say 10 times
that I'm your mother.

195
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,161
- Open up!
- Say it.

196
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:35,841
- You're my mom.
- Properly.

197
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,721
You're my mom.

198
00:42:37,841 --> 00:42:38,721
Look at me.

199
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:40,961
You're my mom, you're my mom...

200
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:42,761
Louder.

201
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:44,801
You're my mom.

202
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:50,721
Stop this foolishness!

203
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:53,401
I'm not playing along anymore.
Understand?

204
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:56,161
There'll be only one breakfast
and one set of clothes.

205
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,681
And promise me not to talk
to your brother!

206
00:42:59,801 --> 00:43:00,801
No.

207
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:02,881
Promise me.

208
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:08,761
I'm going to get so mad!
Promise me!

209
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,601
Give me your cell. Now!

210
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:24,241
Stay in your room!

211
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,841
She wants to tear us apart.

212
00:44:22,841 --> 00:44:23,961
Does that hurt?

213
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:26,441
- Does that hurt?
- No.

214
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,081
Does that hurt?

215
00:46:05,601 --> 00:46:07,521
Mom, please come back.

216
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:11,441
I'll do anything you want.

217
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:14,201
Please come back.

218
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:22,361
All I wish for is that you'll come
back to us.

219
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,121
Elias?

220
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:30,681
Trim around your ear.

221
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:32,081
Here?

222
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:42,201
Better?

223
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,641
Now we look the same.

224
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:49,961
Now she won't be able to tell us apart.

225
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:10,081
It's me. Open the door.

226
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:14,361
Are we friends?

227
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:16,841
I'm not mad anymore.

228
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,041
Please open the door.

229
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:46,921
Well?

230
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:01,841
Are we friends again?

231
00:51:17,321 --> 00:51:18,801
I have something.

232
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:25,321
Thanks.

233
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:27,201
Thanks.

234
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:29,561
- Great, huh?
- Yes.

235
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:34,001
Can we go outside and try it?

236
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:37,641
Yes?

237
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:48,521
Yes?

238
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:54,001
What is it?

239
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:55,761
Can you help us?

240
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:56,921
Yes.

241
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:02,801
What's it about?

242
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:08,481
- Are you the priest?
- No, I'm the sexton.

243
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:11,641
Where's the priest?

244
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,201
He's not here.

245
00:55:17,921 --> 00:55:20,481
- Can we call him?
- Yeah.

246
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:25,081
Sure you can.

247
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:51,801
Can you come inside
the police station with us?

248
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:55,401
And talk to the policeman

249
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:56,961
and explain it to him?

250
00:55:57,281 --> 00:55:58,921
Yeah, no problem.

251
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:02,641
Open up!

252
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:13,241
Come out of there! Come out!

253
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:24,921
Thank you.

254
00:57:31,921 --> 00:57:34,681
Would you like to explain?

255
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:42,041
It was all a bit much.

256
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,441
The accident. The separation.

257
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:14,921
What's going on?

258
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:20,841
What's going on?

259
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:24,641
Where is our mom?

260
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:30,681
I'm going insane. Insane.

261
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:35,881
How do I get up?

262
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:37,961
You don't.

263
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,721
Where is our mom?

264
01:01:46,241 --> 01:01:49,241
Lukas said, "Where is our mom?"

265
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,681
Untie me now.

266
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:54,601
No.

267
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,281
It hurts. Untie me.

268
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:57,401
No.

269
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,721
Tell us where our mom is.

270
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:03,281
I'm your mom!

271
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:08,081
No.

272
01:02:19,161 --> 01:02:20,681
Who's she?

273
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,041
Where are the scissors?

274
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:30,241
Who is she?

275
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:39,161
A friend.

276
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:42,161
We always dressed the same.

277
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:47,921
Who is she really?

278
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:53,961
Answer.

279
01:02:56,921 --> 01:02:58,121
Please answer.

280
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:35,961
Hi, I'm from Vienna.

281
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:40,241
What should I say?
It's my first time doing this.

282
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:43,921
I like to cook, watch movies.

283
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:47,921
But I also enjoy spending
the evening watching TV.

284
01:03:48,401 --> 01:03:49,721
Look.

285
01:04:01,561 --> 01:04:02,561
Go away!

286
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:05,721
Help me.

287
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,161
Stop it!

288
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:16,641
Stop!

289
01:04:17,681 --> 01:04:20,241
- I don't see it.
- What are you doing?

290
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:21,521
Take another look.

291
01:04:22,361 --> 01:04:25,201
What is this? What is this?

292
01:04:25,601 --> 01:04:29,001
- In the video your eyes are brown.
- What?

293
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,641
They're contacts, Christ!
They're in the bathroom.

294
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:53,161
Why are you lying to me?

295
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:01,401
I thought we agreed not to believe her.

296
01:05:01,721 --> 01:05:03,881
So? I changed my mind.

297
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,441
Do you believe her, you retard?

298
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:08,041
You're the retard!

299
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:32,921
Help!

300
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:41,361
Where are the damn scissors?

301
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:44,921
Do you understand? Get the scissors!

302
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:57,001
Lukas?

303
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:05,321
Elias...

304
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:08,321
Lukas?

305
01:06:10,641 --> 01:06:12,881
Sit beside me. Come on.

306
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,761
Come, Elias. Sit here.

307
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:21,081
Come sit beside me, Elias.

308
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:27,521
Come on, sit down. So we can talk.

309
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:31,041
Look.

310
01:06:36,441 --> 01:06:37,601
Elias...

311
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:41,521
You know I'm your mom.

312
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:58,361
I can't untie myself.

313
01:06:58,601 --> 01:07:03,921
Just go to the bathroom,
get the scissors and cut me loose.

314
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:11,321
Nothing bad's happened. Cut me loose.

315
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:17,441
I want you to say 10 times,
"1 won't listen to my brother."

316
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:20,321
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...

317
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:21,841
Louder, please.

318
01:07:21,961 --> 01:07:25,041
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...

319
01:07:25,201 --> 01:07:26,601
I said louder.

320
01:07:28,201 --> 01:07:30,281
Our mom wouldn't do that.

321
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:31,481
More clearly.

322
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:33,521
Elias...

323
01:07:35,881 --> 01:07:37,201
I'm sorry.

324
01:07:37,761 --> 01:07:38,761
Again.

325
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:40,881
I'm sorry, Elias.

326
01:07:51,241 --> 01:07:52,561
Come now.

327
01:07:53,481 --> 01:07:55,241
Please. Cut me loose.

328
01:08:02,921 --> 01:08:04,481
What happened to your nose?

329
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:07,601
Nothing. Nothing serious.

330
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:09,921
There, you see?

331
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,401
You'll cut me loose

332
01:08:15,881 --> 01:08:17,641
and I'll make you breakfast.

333
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,721
Cut my feet loose, they hurt.

334
01:08:26,441 --> 01:08:27,481
Lukas?

335
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:31,481
I know it's hard, but we'll make it.

336
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:34,441
Come, just cut my feet loose.

337
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:42,481
Come on, it'll take a sec.
I'll make breakfast.

338
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:48,201
Just cut it.

339
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:52,001
That's it.

340
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:57,481
What are you doing?

341
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:07,641
There.

342
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:10,681
What?

343
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:17,201
What is it?

344
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:21,881
Stop.

345
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:26,321
They had to remove it in hospital.

346
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:28,801
They're dangerous.

347
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:30,881
Liar!

348
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:33,961
They had to. They had no...

349
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:36,761
Admit that it's a lie.

350
01:09:38,681 --> 01:09:40,881
Just cut me loose, please.

351
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:51,921
Stop.

352
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:53,561
Stop!

353
01:10:19,121 --> 01:10:21,041
Tell us where our mom is.

354
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:29,001
Tell us where our mom is!

355
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:29,881
It's open.

356
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,881
Hello, Red Cross!

357
01:12:35,441 --> 01:12:36,521
Hello?

358
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:40,081
Red Cross. Care to make a donation?

359
01:12:40,561 --> 01:12:42,001
Is anybody home?

360
01:12:45,481 --> 01:12:46,921
I'll have a look.

361
01:12:50,361 --> 01:12:51,401
Hello?

362
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:53,041
Red Cross.

363
01:12:56,721 --> 01:12:57,961
Nobody's there.

364
01:13:01,761 --> 01:13:04,761
It was unlocked, someone must be home.

365
01:13:10,681 --> 01:13:11,761
Hello?

366
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:16,041
Maybe they're upstairs.

367
01:13:22,601 --> 01:13:24,001
Red Cross.

368
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:28,801
- Hello?
- Hello!

369
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:30,681
Hello.

370
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:36,881
Is your mom home?

371
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:39,361
No, she's not home.

372
01:13:39,521 --> 01:13:41,721
Not upstairs? We heard something.

373
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,841
No, that's our dog.

374
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:45,761
- She's not home?
- No.

375
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:47,121
It's our dog.

376
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:51,201
When will Mom be back?

377
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:58,601
She'll be home soon.

378
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,241
Can we wait?

379
01:14:01,761 --> 01:14:03,161
Where should we wait?

380
01:14:13,761 --> 01:14:17,561
Hand me the list.
I'll see how much we've collected.

381
01:14:17,641 --> 01:14:20,561
- The money too?
- Yeah, I'll count it.

382
01:14:21,201 --> 01:14:23,681
- Really bad handwriting.
- Yeah.

383
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:26,801
You'd swear a doctor had written it.

384
01:14:26,961 --> 01:14:28,721
It's barely legible.

385
01:14:30,361 --> 01:14:32,481
Looking forward to school?

386
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:34,841
- Well...
- It starts soon.

387
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:42,721
- Where did you go to school before?
- In Vienna.

388
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:47,361
A lot more going on there.

389
01:14:52,561 --> 01:14:55,241
We've already collected a tidy sum.

390
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:58,241
If somebody else gives as much as him,

391
01:14:58,481 --> 01:15:01,001
we'll have done pretty well.

392
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:06,081
We'll see how much more we get.

393
01:15:06,521 --> 01:15:08,761
What do you do all clay?

394
01:15:09,081 --> 01:15:10,521
Not much.

395
01:15:20,481 --> 01:15:22,361
I have to go to the toilet.

396
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,401
Is your mom back?

397
01:15:53,601 --> 01:15:54,801
Not yet.

398
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:58,121
Is that your own money?

399
01:15:58,361 --> 01:15:59,401
No.

400
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:07,001
- Will your mom be OK with this?
- Yes, I'm sure she will.

401
01:16:08,121 --> 01:16:10,121
She always gives that much.

402
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:14,441
We don't want any trouble.

403
01:16:14,561 --> 01:16:16,081
You realize that...

404
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:21,001
We usually don't
accept money from children.

405
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:22,961
That's a lot of money.

406
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:24,881
No, we're allowed.

407
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:28,201
Well, it is a nice house. Just look.

408
01:16:28,321 --> 01:16:30,801
I guess they can afford it.

409
01:16:36,601 --> 01:16:38,841
As a thank-you for the donation,

410
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:40,801
here's a band-aid.

411
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,161
Help!

412
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:51,441
Help! Help!

413
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:54,481
Help! Help!

414
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,721
Stop! Stop!

415
01:20:16,241 --> 01:20:19,321
Please prove you're our mom.

416
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:32,201
Ask her what my favorite song is.

417
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,561
What's Lukas' favorite song?

418
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:47,121
Lullaby and Good Night?

419
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:20,081
Don't!

420
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:40,161
Can you count the stars that brightly

421
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:44,201
Twinkle in the midnight sky?

422
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:49,121
Can you count the clouds, so lightly

423
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:53,441
O'er the meadows floating by?

424
01:21:54,161 --> 01:21:58,321
God, the Lord, doth mark their number

425
01:21:58,641 --> 01:22:02,441
With His eyes that never slumber

426
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:06,361
You He sees and you He loves

427
01:22:06,921 --> 01:22:10,041
You He sees and you He loves

428
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,001
Where's our mom?

429
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,161
Don't you know when you
have to pee?

430
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:39,921
We're not changing them.

431
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:42,601
Hello?

432
01:23:47,081 --> 01:23:48,401
Untie me.

433
01:24:44,641 --> 01:24:46,361
Now change the bed.

434
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,281
Take off the sheets.

435
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:52,961
Come on, take them off.

436
01:26:54,321 --> 01:26:55,361
Elias?

437
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:57,961
Where's our mom?

438
01:26:59,761 --> 01:27:01,201
Elias, come here.

439
01:27:02,641 --> 01:27:04,161
Where is she?

440
01:27:10,721 --> 01:27:11,721
Fine.

441
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:15,721
Elias, let's make a deal.

442
01:27:17,081 --> 01:27:18,681
I'll play along again.

443
01:27:20,161 --> 01:27:22,201
I'll talk to Lukas again.

444
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:25,321
Lukas will be alive.

445
01:27:30,481 --> 01:27:32,521
I'll make you both breakfast,

446
01:27:32,721 --> 01:27:36,201
put out your clothes.
We'll do things, like before.

447
01:27:36,321 --> 01:27:38,401
But you have to believe me

448
01:27:39,001 --> 01:27:40,601
that I'm your mom.

449
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:45,921
You won't really do that.

450
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:52,361
I promise.

451
01:27:54,161 --> 01:27:55,281
Elias...

452
01:27:57,081 --> 01:27:59,881
It's not your fault Lukas died.

453
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:04,481
The accident wasn't your fault.

454
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:08,441
Do you really believe her?

455
01:28:16,801 --> 01:28:17,801
She's lying.

456
01:28:23,921 --> 01:28:26,521
Let her prove she's our mom.

457
01:28:32,881 --> 01:28:34,361
What am I doing?

458
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:37,321
What's Lukas doing?

459
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:44,321
But I can't see him!

460
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:46,441
What's he doing?

461
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,401
Elias...

462
01:28:56,881 --> 01:28:58,881
Mom would know that.

463
01:29:00,281 --> 01:29:02,081
Mom could see him.

464
01:29:04,241 --> 01:29:06,401
She'd know what he's doing.

465
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:17,401
No, Elias. Don't!

466
01:29:19,481 --> 01:29:20,841
Elias, don't!

467
01:29:21,401 --> 01:29:23,081
Elias, do you hear me?

468
01:29:36,161 --> 01:29:38,161
Help! Help!

469
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:38,641
God, the Lord, doth mark their number

470
01:31:39,081 --> 01:31:42,801
With His eyes that never slumber

471
01:31:43,161 --> 01:31:46,841
You He sees and you He loves

472
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:51,561
You He sees and you He loves
