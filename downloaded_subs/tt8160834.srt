[exhales]

00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:44,694
[up-tempo music plays]

4
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,329
What up, kids? It's Cole.

5
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:48,465
This is ERL.

6
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:50,433
I just got out of the bathroom.

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,069
And I am so high.

8
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:54,671
30,000-feet-in-the-air high!
Sorry.

9
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:58,910
Anyway, this month marks ten
years of having doing this.

10
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,611
Ten! What?!
[imitates beeping sound]

11
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:05,749
You better buckle those safety belts because
ten years of filming is a ton of footage.

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,955
<i>And before we left on this
trip, I went through all of it.</i>

13
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,355
<i>Or most of it.</i>

14
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:13,490
<i>Or some of it.</i>

15
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,358
<i>There's just so much!</i>

16
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,494
Did you see that?

17
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:19,663
<i>It's hard to believe how many
adventures we've been on together.</i>

18
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:23,034
[growls]

19
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,402
<i>Before any of that stuff,
my parents were filming me.</i>

20
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,004
[Cole's dad] Cole, Cole, Cole.
Watch out! Hold on. Hold on, buddy.

21
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:29,372
[Cole] <i>All the time.</i>

22
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:31,741
- <i>Hey, look. It's tiny me.</i>
- [Cole's mom] Happy birthday, Cole.

23
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:35,046
[Cole] <i>Once I got my hands on a
camera, I was filming everything.</i>

24
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,848
- [Cole screams]
- [Cole's mom screams]

25
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,816
- [Cole's mom] Come on, Cole, you got it!
- Oh!

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,684
- [Cole] <i>Ouch.</i>
- Thomas, keep your eyes on the road.

27
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:43,486
<i>And when I got older,
I started this channel</i>

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,157
<i>and began sharing my videos
with you and it blew up!</i>

29
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,392
<i>Now I get to do this
for a living!</i>

30
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:52,163
<i>Which is nuts!</i>

31
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,397
<i>I traveled all over the world,</i>

32
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,068
<i>looking for the wildest
experiences to entertain you guys.</i>

33
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:00,104
A 100,000... 250...
Half a million followers.

34
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:04,441
I'm in Brooklyn! Birmingham, Alabama.
I'm in Detroit.

35
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:05,642
ERL is in Nepal.

36
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,044
[crowd cheers]

37
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,479
<i>You watched, commented...</i>

38
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:10,915
[chuckles]

39
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,183
[Cole] <i>and told me
what to do next.</i>

40
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,051
What up, kids, it's Cole.

41
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,553
I challenge all of you to find
something that scares me.

42
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,122
I dare you! Come on!

43
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,091
[grunts]

44
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:21,792
<i>And I listened!</i>

45
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:23,127
Hey. Hi.

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,462
OK, go, go. Shit.

47
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:27,664
- Sir, you can't film here.
- I'm not, it's not on.

48
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:29,599
I'm in a coffin
being buried alive.

49
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,534
[dirt hitting coffin]
OK, it's not so bad.

50
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,705
Hello? Oh, shit.

51
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,440
<i>Looking at all this crazy shit</i>

52
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,442
<i>we've done together,
and this escape from real life,</i>

53
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:41,645
<i>none of this would've been
possible</i>

54
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,580
- <i>if it wasn't for this vlog and for all of you.</i>
- [Cole] Shi...

55
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:44,815
<i>So thank you.</i>

56
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:45,950
Woo! [laughs]

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,818
<i>All right, the nostalgia trip
is over.</i>

58
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:49,552
<i>So, if you remember back
in August,</i>

59
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,089
we asked you to vote
on where we should go

60
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:54,125
to celebrate this amazing
occasion.

61
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:56,426
Over a million of you
weighed in and...

62
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,829
Moscow.

63
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:00,798
My friends pulled all the
stops

64
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,532
and they hooked us up
with first-class tickets!

65
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:04,567
That's right!

66
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,670
As usual, I'm taking you somewhere
you've probably never been

67
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:08,505
to show you something
you've never seen.

68
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,107
I know where we're going

69
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:12,642
but I have no idea
what we're doing

70
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:14,511
because they won't tell me!

71
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:15,780
- Dash!
- Evening!

72
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,647
- Samantha!
- Yo. Yeah.

73
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,716
Actually, Samantha wasn't
supposed to be here because

74
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,584
she's usually training
for the X Games,

75
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,586
But for the first time in
forever, she didn't qualify.

76
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,056
[female] Ooh! Oh!

77
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:27,091
- Ouch!
- Fuck you, OK?

78
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,591
- Hey, hey, hey. Children are watching.
- [Samantha chuckles]

79
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,628
- And... Erin is here!
- Hi, guys!

80
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,596
Yeah, it's her first time
out of the states.

81
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,665
- Are you serious?
- [Erin] Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,101
- Besides Mexico.
- [Samantha chuckles]

83
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,769
Which does not count.

84
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:41,738
But you can plan on seeing
a lot more of her!

85
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:42,773
Really?

86
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:43,808
Yes, they will.

87
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,276
So, we're almost there

88
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,743
and then you kinda have to
tell me, OK?

89
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:47,878
I think I've waited
long enough.

90
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,280
OK. Not a chance.

91
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,182
[Cole] OK, fine.

92
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:52,183
You know what?
That's all for now.

93
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,683
No, wait, wait, wait!

94
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:54,752
- I'm turning this off.
- Wait, wait.

95
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:55,820
Get ready.

96
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,687
[screams]

97
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,190
Oh, my God!

98
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:01,192
This is my best friend
in the world, Thomas!

99
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:04,195
Oh, yeah! First class.
I see you, big dog. OK! [chuckles]

100
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,864
Dude, wait, where were you
this whole flight? [chuckles]

101
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,631
Coach. I wanted it
to be a surprise.

102
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,034
Thank you so much.
You guys are the best.

103
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,668
[Thomas] Thanks, bro.
Anything for you.

104
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,037
[Erin] Here, let me get this.
[Thomas] OK.

105
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,872
[Cole] All right.
[Thomas] Happy ten!

106
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,173
[Dash] Happy ten years, buddy.
[Thomas] Love you, man!

107
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:17,108
You guys are
the best friends ever.

108
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,242
Cheers!

109
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:28,219
[indistinct chatter]

110
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,290
[Dash] Oh, finally.
He's finished.

111
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:34,859
Oh, look who's done.

112
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,331
[Cole] All right. [sighs]
What the hell we doing?

113
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,599
'Cause, 'cause, like,
come on.

114
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,601
I've been waiting, so...

115
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,303
you... you, like, tell me,
like, for real.

116
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:47,338
You gonna tell me, or...?

117
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,939
All right. So...

118
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:52,176
I have a buddy in Moscow
named Alexei.

119
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,311
This guy is next-level loaded.

120
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,946
And when I told him you're
coming,

121
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,747
he watches ERL. Loves you, bro.

122
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,582
He wants to take us everywhere.

123
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,852
I'm talking the best clubs,
the best restaurants,

124
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:05,756
And when I mean "the best," this
guy's so rich, that everything he does

125
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,925
is legitimately the best.

126
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,960
OK, OK.
Clubs and restaurants,

127
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:13,964
but like what are we
actually doing there?

128
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:16,033
- [Thomas] Are you done?
- Yes, go ahead. Sorry.

129
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:20,337
We are taking you to an escape
room experience in Moscow.

130
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,673
[chuckles] Seriously?

131
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:27,845
You're serious?

132
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,746
That's what it is? Yeah?

133
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,782
We're flying all the way to
Russia to go do an escape room?

134
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:35,352
- I've been to escape rooms, man. Come on.
- No, no. Yeah.

135
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:37,321
[Cole] Dude, I can't vlog an escape room.
What are you, nuts?

136
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,390
I get it, you been to an escape
room but not one like this, bro.

137
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,258
This one you have to be
personally invited to.

138
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,626
It's custom-made.
It's scary as hell.

139
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,864
And that means it's
perfect for you.

140
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:49,800
OK. No one else
could do this.

141
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,402
They built it for us.

142
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,702
[Dash] Swear to God.

143
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,843
- [Cole] OK.
- [chuckles]

144
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:00,845
[Cole] OK! OK. OK.

145
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,348
All right,
say that one more time.

146
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:06,683
You're taking me to
an escape room?

147
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,685
- We're...
- For those of you who don't know what an escape room is,

148
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,288
it's a game where they lock
you and your friends in a room

149
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:13,390
and you have to solve puzzles
to try and get out.

150
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:15,159
- [blows raspberry]
- [Dash] Why does that need to be explained?

151
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,394
Oh, and they don't have
the same rules we do, so...

152
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,232
Exactly! Thank you.
Which means, Cole, dear friend of mine,

153
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,299
you can't be a pussy!

154
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,868
Oh, dude! Come on, man!

155
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,870
You know that I am up
for anything!

156
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,405
Oh! Give me that!
You guys heard him, he said anything!

157
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,074
Give it! All right.

158
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,708
They're letting us tie into
their cameras,

159
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,444
which means, you guys are
gonna be able to see it.

160
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,913
OK. How do you know
this Alexei guy?

161
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,848
His dad is some politics
or some shit,

162
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,316
I don't even know.
But the last time I met him,

163
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,252
he was throwing around
money like an idiot, bro.

164
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:43,020
It was insane.

165
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,289
We ended up on a yacht
for, like, a fuckin' week.

166
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,791
[chuckles] Oh, shit.
Delete that last part.

167
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,859
No, dude. This is live.

168
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,029
Samantha's responsible for me.

169
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,465
So there you go.
Mystery revealed.

170
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,301

Have you ever wondered
what's back there?

[All] No, not once ever. No.

197
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,346

[speaking Russian]

348
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:06,683
Motherfucker.

349

[speaking Russian]

350
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,622
You and your friends
are fucked!

351
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:15,292
[speaking Russian]

352
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,526
I'm watching you, you bitch.

353
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,930
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah.

354
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:20,497
Who the fuck were those guys?

355
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,901
Hey, you OK?

356
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:27,038
- Yeah. Let's just go.
- OK.

357
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,371
Sorry about that.

358
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,573
Let's get the fuck out of here.

359
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:31,042
Let's go. Come on.

360
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,709
[Cole] Let's get the fuck
out of here. Now. Go.

361
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,913
- What was that? What the fuck?
- Let it go.

362
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:38,515
Come on. Ooh!

363
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:44,021
I apologize for not
coming sooner.

364
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:47,657
I wouldn't know what would've
happened if you didn't get there.

365
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,426
I mean, like, who were those
fuckin' guys?

366
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,561
I feel like they knew Alexei
or something.

367
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,397
Those clubs are [in Russian].

368
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,533
How you say? A bad type.

369
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,936
Mr. Koslov should know better.

370
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,671
Well, thank you.

371
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:03,507
For, you know... Thanks.

372
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,878
Eh, [speaking Russian]

373
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:09,613
I wonder if Alexei
got any of that on camera.

374
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,353
Sorry.

375
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:22,894
I'm just glad that we're all...

376
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,628
safe, you know?

377
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,735
[sighs]

378
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,696
[inaudible dialogue]

379
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,007
- [Erin] Cole.
- [Cole sighs]

380
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,743
[Erin] <i>You've gotten used to all
of these people following you</i>

381
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:17,347
<i>and watching everything you do.
And it's exciting.</i>

382
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:22,419
<i>But I finally get to be
a part of it with you.</i>

383
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:25,455
<i>I'm not sure what these trips
are normally like.</i>

384
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:28,625
<i>But it looked like
we were in real danger.</i>

385
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:30,694
<i>And you were too busy
with your fans to notice.</i>

386
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:34,832
<i>That guy pulled a gun on us.</i>

387
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:38,635
<i>And afterwards, I couldn't tell if
you were more concerned about me</i>

388
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:41,973
or how many people
were watching.

389
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:45,642
<i>I know there are
two sides to you.</i>

390
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:48,779
<i>The public Cole.
And the real Cole.</i>

391
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:50,647
<i>My Cole.</i>

392
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,450
<i>They both have their place,
but...</i>

393
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:57,487
<i>I always thought you knew
the difference.</i>

394
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:07,098
[sighs]

395
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,535
[Dash and Mina chuckle]

396
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,639
- [Dash] Don't forget. At Dash.
- [Mina] OK.

397
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:18,175
- [Dash] Dash! Don't forget to call me back. Cool.
- [Mina] Mm-hmm.

398
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,813
[Erin and Cole] Good morning.

399
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,681
- Morning!
- Good morning.

400
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,853
[sighs, then moans]

401
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,589
[Samantha] Morning, guys.

402
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:34,025
[Erin and Cole] Morning.

403
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:35,725
[Cole] How was last night?

404
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,095
[chuckles] Now you know
your boy can't drink.

405
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,629
He's still in
my room, asleep.

406
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:41,165
Oh, he ended up
in your room?

407
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,100
I kicked him out of
my place last night.

408
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,535
You have no shame at all.

409
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,138
No, no. Did you see her?

410
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,472
Exactly. You would've
done the same thing.

411
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,008
[chuckles]

412
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,810
Oh, I think Alexei's sending
a car for us at two.

413
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,845
Yeah.

414
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,514
Oh, do you guys mind if
I steal him for the day?

415
00:19:57,547 --> 00:20:00,117
- [Dash] What?! No, I thought we were gonna go sight-seeing.
- [Samantha] Absolutely.

416
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:03,854
Thomas is not getting up no time soon.
We can just do our own thing.

417
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:06,257
[tsk] Fine, whatever.
Who needs you guys?

418
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,126
We have a fireplace.
We have a spa.

419
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,828
We have room service.
That's all paid for, yeah?

420
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,229
[chuckles]

421
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:13,798
[Dash] Yeah, we don't need
you guys.

422
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,736
It's two o'clock.

423
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,507
It's the only car here.

424
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,742
I guess this ours?

425
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:26,944
[Erin] Obviously. [chuckles]

426
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:35,585
Hi. Are you here for Cole...?

427
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:37,221
Cole. Turner.

428
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:40,925
Please, step inside.

429
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,593
- Um...
- [engine starts]

430
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,629
Please, step inside.

431
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,165
Thank you.

432
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,610
That's so pretty.

433
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,584
- Should we get out and walk? The Red Square's right up here.
- [Cole] Oh yeah.

434
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:10,821
Mr. Alexei told me to stay
with you. I wouldn't want to...

435
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:12,555
Yeah, but that's OK.
Stop right up here.

436
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:13,891
Yeah, yeah, stop right up here.

437
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:16,827
It's perfect. We'll meet
you back here later.

438
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:20,730
Uh, can you unlock the door,
please?

439
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:27,604
Can I just take you to the place I
was told to take you? And then...

440
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:31,275
She... she wants to see Red
Square, and we're kinda tourists.

441
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:33,010
So we'll meet back here later.

442
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:38,949
OK. OK, I'll pick you up
on the far side.

443
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:40,351
Perfect.

444
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,852
Baby, we haven't exchanged
currency yet.

445
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:42,887
Uh, do you know where we
can get...?

446
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,988
You don't have any rubles?

447
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,795
How about 100 dollars?
No worries.

448
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:54,697
Most places will not
take credit.

449
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,900
Thanks, bro.

450
00:21:57,368 --> 00:21:58,903
I need to have you by eight!
You...

451
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,286
[inaudible dialogue]

452
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:37,208
[Erin] So it's 6:15 here,
that means at home it's...

453
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,844
8:15 AM.

454
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:42,346
I always keep the watch
on LA time. Ha!

455
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:43,881
You're so weird.

456
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,952
I thought I'd have
terrible jet lag and...

457
00:22:47,985 --> 00:22:50,955
Mm. Everything last night.

458
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:52,689
Hm.

459
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:54,258
Oh, that bed was so comfy.
I slept like a rock.

460
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,759
Me, too.

461
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:59,029
I'm glad I get you almost
to myself today.

462
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:00,898
[both chuckle]

463
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:04,034
So am I. This was good.
I'm glad we stumbled in here.

464
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:05,436
Imagine that.

465
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:06,937
Oh, my God.

466
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:08,906
Not having to ask anyone.

467
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,975
- I mean, I'm actually really proud of you.
- Thank you.

468
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:13,377
- How will anyone even know that we were here?
- I don't know.

469
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,778
I mean, that we had so much fun?

470
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:15,946
And it was so beautiful.

471
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,948
- OK. OK.
- [Erin chuckles]

472
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:20,985
[speaking Russian]

473
00:23:21,018 --> 00:23:22,086
Oh.

474
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,790
- Thank you.
- [speaking Russian]

475
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:33,397
Hey, uh, how much, uh...

476
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:35,933
[Erin] What's wrong?

477
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,802
Well, it's not US dollars.

478
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,138
- [distant]
- [Erin chuckles]

479
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:44,942
[distant] Cole?

480
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,312
Do you have cash?

481
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,081
Uh, [scoffs].
Do I have enough cash?

482
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:52,715
[clicks tongue]

483
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:53,951
OK.

484
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:55,152
Oops.

485
00:23:57,755 --> 00:23:58,822
[grunts]

486
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,960
Looks like it.

487
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:04,395
You're really cool.

488
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:05,429
Thanks.

489
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:06,830
You get that a lot?

490
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,199
I do.

491
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:10,100
Yeah, you clearly like
the lifestyle. I get it.

492
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,802
I'm slowly picking up on that.

493
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,305
I'm Russian-rich.

494
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:16,840
Um, Mr. Koslov
has taken care of your meal

495
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,109
and the driver
is waiting outside.

496
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:21,011
Wait, Alexei?

497
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:24,381
OK.

498
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:25,482
Oh!

499
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,387
This is yours.

500
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:31,455
Huh?

501
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:38,996
What is this?

502
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:40,730
Mm.

503
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:46,470
Hey. How did Alexei
even know where we are?

504
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:48,005
[Erin] I don't know.

505
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,873
Is that cool or creepy?

506
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,042
Uh, yeah,

507
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,911
A little, yeah.

508
00:24:53,944 --> 00:24:55,446
Excited for tonight?

509
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,348
You know me,
I'm gonna hype anything.

510
00:24:57,381 --> 00:25:00,017
But I hope that
it is big enough.

511
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,518
No, I wouldn't worry
about that.

512
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:03,153
Like, just wait.

513
00:25:03,187 --> 00:25:04,221
Oh, my...

514
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:08,092
Cole.

515
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,159
Yeah?

516
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,398
What?

517
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,066
This is all for you.

518
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,035
So if tonight gets too intense,
I hope you know...

519
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:20,104
Too intense?
We're going to an escape room.

520
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:23,040
Come on. Stop.

521
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:24,174
All right. [sighs]

522
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,175
What?

523
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,910
OK.

524
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,379
Do you remember who you're
talking to right now?

525
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:30,581
Oh, shut up.

526
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,249
Come on, let's go.

527
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:41,191
Actually, hold on.
Wait, for real.

528
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,529
Hey, kids. It's Cole.

529
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:48,165
I just wanted to hop on
really fast and thank everybody

530
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:53,070
so much for their suggestions.
AlisaV34, the Bolshoi was mmm...

531
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:55,472
Amazing! Yes!

532
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:58,409
And I don't know why everybody
shit-talks Russia so much,

533
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:02,012
besides all the guns and
gangsters, actually not that bad.

534
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:09,219
It's not!

535
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:10,554
You know.

536
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:11,588
OK?

537
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:15,859
So anyway, in three hours,

538
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:19,096
we will be going live from
this mysterious escape room.

539
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:23,167
See what happens
9 PM Moscow time.

540
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,635
- [Erin] Let's go.
- [Cole] And we out!

541
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,503
- [Erin] This is stupid.
- [Cole] OK, OK.

542
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,521
[Erin indistinct]

543
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:46,190
Oh, actually...

544
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,460
Hey, thank you so much.

545
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:51,595
No, Mr. Cole.
Uh, you keep it.

546
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:53,997
I... I insist, please.
You keep it. Please.

547
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:54,998
Oh.

548
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,100
Shit!

549
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:02,139
[Alexei] You two ready?

550
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:03,173
[Erin] What?

551
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,274
Hey.

552
00:27:06,577 --> 00:27:08,112
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

553
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:09,246
He didn't give you
any trouble, did he?

554
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,914
'Cause I will fucking fire him.

555
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:12,549
No, no, no. It's no big deal.

556
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,551
- Want to stay here? I should
get changed before we go.

557
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:15,919
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

558
00:27:15,953 --> 00:27:17,955
OK, then. [speaks Russian]

559
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,657
I am so happy for you.

560
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:22,626
I wish I could go again.

561
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,294
You can't go twice?

562
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:25,562
No.

563
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,264
This is all he could talk about

564
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:30,200
for a month after we went.

565
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,569
About how intense it was.

566
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:34,705
And how it gave him life.

567
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,508
Hey. [speaking Russian]
OK?

568
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,010
Yeah? [speaks Russian]

569
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:46,083
[speaks Russian]

570
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,218
[speaks Russian]

571
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,628
Hey, man.
What'd you get into today?

572
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:00,230
Oh. Room service.

573
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,599
Fire. I got a massage.

574
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,968
I know you're jealous.
I know.

575
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:08,005
I'm on vacation, baby.

576
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:11,708
About to get ready
for tonight. [chuckles]

577
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:26,290
[sighs]

578
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:28,725
- Hey.
- Hm.

579
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,397
[Dash] Oh, this place is fire.

580
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,035
[Thomas] Oh, yup,
this has got me out.

581
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,677
OK, now.

582
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,248
Remember. As real
as everything might seem,

583
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:53,717
OK?

584
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:55,986
You're safe.

585
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,355
OK?

586
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,359
That's dramatic.

587
00:29:04,428 --> 00:29:05,395
Let's do it.

588
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:08,198
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

589
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,168
[Alexei] OK.

590
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:13,203
[buzzing]

591
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:20,344
OK.

592
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:27,017
[Thomas] Not sketchy at all.

593
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,789
Tonight! In true ERL fashion,

594
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:33,690
we are taking you to the most
intense,

595
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:39,429
the most hyper-exclusive,
escape room in Moscow.

596
00:29:39,463 --> 00:29:42,432
That's right! Just for you,
they're letting us tie

597
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:44,101
into their cameras

598
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:45,770
so you all can watch
what's happening live.

599
00:29:45,803 --> 00:29:51,208
And because every experience
is completely different,

600
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:53,110
You never know what's gonna
happen! Oh, my God.

601
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:54,846
Alexei, come here, come here.

602
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:57,114
Is there any way they can find
this place online

603
00:29:57,147 --> 00:29:58,515
Do you have a website?
Do you have a profile?

604
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,384
Do you have a hashtag?
Do you have any...

605
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:03,420
- [Alexei] No.
- No, you don't! Because ERL is the only place

606
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:05,122
you can get this content.
That's right! Uh!

607
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:07,190
[laugh]
- [Cole] You guys ready or what?

608
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:10,727
- Not as much as you. Jesus Christ!
- All right, let's do this.

609
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:12,696
[Alexei] OK, Cole,
they will begin streaming it

610
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:16,133
- directly into your device.
- Let's do it.

611
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,200
OK.

612
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:21,171
All right.

613
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:24,708
[Cole] Don't lose that.
Don't lose that phone.

614
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:30,380
[Alexei] They are good to go.

615
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:33,751
[Cole] My backup phone.
Hope they don't find all my nudes.

616
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:35,686
Just kidding, just kidding.
Erin, stop.

617
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,354
It's a joke.

618
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:38,422
[Erin] But how much fun
would they be?

619
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:42,392
- Scared?
- No. [chuckles]

620
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:44,762
So, what do you think
they're doing?

621
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,730
I don't got a clue.

622
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:47,832
- [chuckles]
- It's like that.

623
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:51,735
Fuck.

624
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,303
[Samantha] Who are these guys?

625
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:54,504
[Alexei] They'll be
taking you inside.

626
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:56,306
But they only speak
Russian.

627
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,275
So I told them I'd give you
instructions in English.

628
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:01,712
You're being held
in a Bolshevik prison.

629
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,915
This is a facility where
enemies of the state

630
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:08,151
were tortured, questioned
and killed.

631
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,788
The last man executed
is still inside.

632
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:15,292
He stole the cell block key and
hid it in the only place he could.

633
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:17,795
They tortured him.
Starved him.

634
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,263
But he never gave it up.

635
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:22,800
You must release
your companions

636
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,401
before the timer runs out.

637
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,572
And they are executed.

638
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,392
Fuck.

639
00:32:23,627 --> 00:32:24,862
[sighs]

640
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:45,917
[Cole] What?

641
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:50,587
[chuckles] This is crazy.

642
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,389
[chuckles]

643
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,559
[alarm sounds]

644
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:04,568
Ugh.

645
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:29,894
Yo, guys, this place is legit.

646
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,528
[Thomas] Hey, Cole!

647
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,832
Yeah?

648
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:37,334
Is anybody else
down here?

649
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,535
[Thomas laughs] Yeah, me.

650
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:40,403
[chuckles]

651
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,074
[Thomas] I'm... I'm strapped
into some kind of... machine.

652
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:44,341
OK.

653
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,312
Ugh.

654
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,680
[Thomas] Cole!

655
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:52,349
OK, hang tight!

656
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:55,585
OK.

657
00:34:00,724 --> 00:34:01,759
Oof.

658
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:05,729
This guy real?

659
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:10,768
Holy shit.

660
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:17,008
I think I'm supposed to
cut this guy open?

661
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:25,615
This is really weird.

662
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,685
Super creepy. I, uh,
am feeling a little weird about it.

663
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,089
No one's gonna stop me?

664
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:36,726
[whispering]
Oh, my goodness.

665
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:39,696
I got this.

666
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,398
All right.

667
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:43,134
This is so sketch.

668
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,668
All right.

669
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:48,572
I'm gonna do it.

670
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,375
Oh, shit.

671
00:35:00,084 --> 00:35:01,118
Ugh.

672
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,486
Ew, weird.

673
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,834
Uh... I don't know
what I'm looking for.

674
00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:19,837
OK, it's not there.

675
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:22,739
Sorry, man, it's weird
for me, too.

676
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:32,149
[chuckles]

677
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:34,118
This is so sick.

678
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,854
Oh.

679
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:43,660
Oh!

680
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,067
Ugh.

681
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:52,602
[sighs]

682
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:10,687
[grunts]

683
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:27,104
Erin!

684
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:29,572
Erin! Are you OK?

685
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,108
[muffled] This is
so fuckin' crazy.

686
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:36,579
[muffled] The key. The key.
I don't know what to do.

687
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:38,783
[man] Hello!

688
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:41,218
OK. I'll be right back.

689
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,789
OK.

690
00:36:58,702 --> 00:36:59,870
[chuckles]

691
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:02,139
Hey, Sam.
How you doin'?

692
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:03,874
Nice to see you
doin' good.

693
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,076
Man, this shit
is uncomfortable.

694
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,144
Hey, Alexei was not joking.

695
00:37:07,178 --> 00:37:09,213
Do you guys think
this is a real prison?

696
00:37:09,246 --> 00:37:10,915
I think it's a real prison.

697
00:37:10,948 --> 00:37:13,583
[Alexei over speaker]
<i>Ha ha! I told you!</i>

698
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:16,519
Oh, so you guys are watching.

699
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:18,289
[Alexei over speaker]
<i>Better get going, baby face.</i>

700
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:20,758
<i>Your friends don't have</i>
<i>much time left.</i> [chuckles]

701
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:24,594
Baby face.
Hey, everybody.

702
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,563
I'm gonna solve
all these puzzles quick.

703
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:27,697
Watch this.

704
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,835
[Dash] Hey, something's
happening down here.

705
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:32,269
'Kay, coming.

706
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:33,670
[Thomas] Hey, seriously.
Get down here, man.

707
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:34,772
This is starting to hurt.

708
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,841
[gears spinning]

709
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:39,910
Finally.

710
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:42,079
Wow. Look at you guys.

711
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:43,781
Where's Erin and Sam?

712
00:37:43,814 --> 00:37:45,116
You guys are all in
different torture devices.

713
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:46,817
Sam's in an electric chair,

714
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:49,887
and Erin is down there
in some sort of a tank?

715
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,858
Oh, OK.
Yo, what happened to your hands?

716
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,625
The key that I used
to get in here,

717
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:59,230
I had to cut out
of a guy's stomach!

718
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:00,697
This is blood!

719
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,665
Like a real dude?

720
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,336
Yes, Dash.
Like a real dead Russian.

721
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:06,904
From the war.

722
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:11,175
No! I don't know, man!
I don't know.

723
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,243
- I don't know.
- [Dash laughs] Crazy.

724
00:38:12,276 --> 00:38:13,944
I mean, look where we are.

725
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:16,213
You had me, though.
Not gonna lie. You had me.

726
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:17,948
Guys. O-OK,
serious, though.

727
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:20,583
Uh, when that door opened,
this started pulling.

728
00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:23,620
- This door?
- [Dash] Hey!

729
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:25,688
This thing right here
is starting to close.

730
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,158
[Cole] O-OK.

731
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:28,926
Uh, each of the rooms
across from you guys

732
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:31,328
have puzzles and those are
the only doors that are open.

733
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:32,595
I guess I just need to
solve them and... and

734
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:33,964
I'll get you guys out.

735
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:36,834
Just stay right there.
Don't move.

736
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,701
[Dash] OK. I mean, we
can't go anywhere but, yeah.

737
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:39,870
- Hang tight.
- [Thomas and Dash] Cole!

738
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,372
- I know.
- [Thomas] Jesus!

739
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:47,278
Huh. So these probably connect
to Dash's cell.

740
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:51,949
And then there's more
in that room. Huh.

741
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:54,584
OK, please hurry.

742
00:38:59,957 --> 00:39:02,860
[Dash] Hey... Yo, where are you going, bro?
These things are sharp!

743
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:04,261
[Cole] You'll be fine.

744
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:05,695
[Dash] Hurry!

745
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,864
Oh, yeah.

746
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:11,335
What up, kids?
I'm using gears to solve puzzles

747
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:13,070
to save my friends' lives.

748
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,207
- Lives are at stake.
- Hey, Cole!

749
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,707
Yeah, buddy.

750
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,276
I don't mean to sound
like a wimp

751
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,878
but this is starting
to get uncomfortable.

752
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:22,813
[Dash mocking] Aww, Thomas.

753
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,281
Is this a little scawy for you?
[Thomas] Man, whatever, G.

754
00:39:24,315 --> 00:39:25,748
You sound like a wimp!

755
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:26,749
I'm gonna need you
to hang tight.

756
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:31,654
[grunts] Oh! Ah!

757
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:32,790
Oh, boy.

758
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:33,824
Hold on!

759
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:34,959
[grunts]

760
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,227
This is gonna be
a piece of cake.

761
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,161
- [alarm sounds]
- What was that?

762
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:38,229
Sorry.

763
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:39,330
Sorry.

764
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:40,865
OK, all right.

765
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,665
Dude, these things
are coming close.

766
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,068
- [grunts]
- [Dash] I think now's a good time

767
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:45,836
to let you guys know
I'm claustrophobic.

768
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,737
Yup! I think it's this one.

769
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,407
[Thomas]
Cole, it's tightening!

770
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,309
[grunts] Oh!

771
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:53,743
Cole!

772
00:39:53,777 --> 00:39:55,446
I got it.

773
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,047
[Thomas] Get me out
of this shit!

774
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:58,782
Oh! Uh, yeah, man.

775
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:00,284
You probably should speed up
for his sake.

776
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,019
- OK, whoa. Whoa.
- [Thomas yells]

777
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,720
Yeah, hold on!

778
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:07,958
- [Thomas screams]
- [Dash] Whatever you did, don't do it.

779
00:40:07,992 --> 00:40:09,059
It's getting faster!
It's getting faster!

780
00:40:09,093 --> 00:40:10,261
Yes! Almost done!

781
00:40:10,294 --> 00:40:11,862
Yo, where are you going?

782
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:12,930
- Where are you running?
- [Thomas grunts]

783
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:14,798
I gotta do the other side!

784
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:16,133
[Thomas yells]

785
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,836
Seriously, this is starting
to hurt!

786
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:19,970
[grunts] So heavy, dude.
Hold on.

787
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,072
OK, whoa. Whoa.

788
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:23,941
Uh, this is not OK.

789
00:40:23,974 --> 00:40:25,009
- [alarm sounds]
- Oh, dammit!

790
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:28,012
- [Thomas] Ah!
- [Cole grunts]

791
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:29,346
[Dash] Fix my shit first!

792
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,048
OK, OK, OK...
B-b-b-b-b-back!

793
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:33,050
Ooh-ooh. Great. OK.

794
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,752
[grunts]

795
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:36,754
This is starting to get
a little fucking painful!

796
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:37,888
Hey, Thomas, hold on!
[chuckles]

797
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:40,024
Hold on! [grunts]

798
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:41,158
[grunts]

799
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:44,161
B-b-b-b-b-b!

800
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:46,163
[screams]

801
00:40:46,497 --> 00:40:47,965
[Dash] Whoa-whoa-whoa!

802
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:52,870
[screaming and yelling]

803
00:40:52,903 --> 00:40:53,971
Last one!

804
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:55,873
[screaming]

805
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:56,974
- [machines stop]
- [Dash] Oh!

806
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,743
Ooh-oh. Oh! Oh, shit.

807
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:02,179
[grunts]

808
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:04,815
Thank God. That was
way too fucking close.

809
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:07,918
[Cole] Oh. It worked.

810
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:09,787
Guys! I think I did it.

811
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:13,090
[Dash] Let me tell you how
claustrophobic I was getting.

812
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,360
[pants]

813
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,962
[Cole] All right! Thomasito,
I'm coming for ya.

814
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:21,966
Cole, get me out of this shit.
[pants]

815
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:24,535
[Dash] I know Alexei said this was
gonna hurt, but that shit was intense.

816
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:26,837
Look, we're running
out of time.

817
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,072
[Alexei over speaker] <i>Oh,
you better get moving, guys.</i>

818
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:29,340
Even he saw that.

819
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:30,874
Come on. Phantom Alexei.

820
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:31,875
[Thomas] Get this shit
over with.

821
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,077
[Dash chuckles]

822
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,379
[laughs]

823
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:36,981
Oh, God. This is
even kinky for you.

824
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:38,482
- I'm not gonna lie.
- Just get me out of here.

825
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:42,019
- We can't hear you.
- Get me out of here!

826
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:44,955
[muffled] Guys, I ain't
fucking... [indistinct]

827
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:46,790
Just come on, man.

828
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:49,893
All right.
We'll be back.

829
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,962
Unless you don't want us
to help you. Do you need help?

830
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:53,230
Come on, man.
Fuck you, man.

831
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:54,832
- What?
- Nothing. Get me out of here!

832
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:57,067
You... you like the chair?

833
00:41:57,101 --> 00:41:59,169
You like... [laughs]

834
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:01,038
- [Samantha] You play too much, come on!
- [Dash] What?

835
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:02,840
[Thomas] All right, this looks
pretty straight-forward.

836
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:05,175
- [Dash laughs]
- Yeah.

837
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:08,012
- It's just a maze.
- Duh, it's a maze, Cole.

838
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:09,913
This is pretty cool, though.

839
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,415
OK, so...

840
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,450
You gotta go this way, yeah?

841
00:42:13,484 --> 00:42:15,185
I guess it goes around?

842
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:16,387
- [sharp metal sound]
- Damn!

843
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,554
[Samantha screams]

844
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:19,089
[Dash] Whoa! Yo.

845
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:21,425
I think you just shocked her.

846
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,193
[Alexei over speaker] <i>Hey,
you should be more careful with that, huh?</i>

847
00:42:23,227 --> 00:42:25,195
[Dash] Oh, OK. Let me see
this. Move, move, move.

848
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:27,931
Yeah, but, hey. But did you
hear what they said?

849
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,134
- Yeah.
- You got to be careful.

850
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,169
- [mocking] Be careful.
- Guys, guys. Come on. Let's get out of here.

851
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:34,004
All right. OK.

852
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:36,440
All right, so what'd you do
to shock her? You just... that?

853
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,541
- [electricity buzzes]
- [Samantha yells]

854
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:40,611
Oh ho. Whoops!

855
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,413
- [electricity buzzes]
- [Samantha yells]

856
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:43,580
[chuckles]

857
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:45,182
Easy, easy, easy.

858
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:46,417
- [electricity buzzes]
- [Samantha yells]

859
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,618
This is crazy. Look.

860
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:49,086
Dash! Dash, stop! Stop!

861
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,554
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

862
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:52,222
[Samantha moans]

863
00:42:52,256 --> 00:42:53,223
- [Thomas] Stop, guys! Easy!
- Thomas, relax.

864
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:54,625
-Yo, what the fuck?

865
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:55,893
Look! I think it's actually
hurting her!

866
00:42:56,593 --> 00:42:57,861
[groans]

867
00:43:00,064 --> 00:43:01,565
Relax, bro! It's a game!

868
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:04,468
Samantha, is this hurting you?

869
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,869
[grunts]

870
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:06,904
Should we get them
to stop this game?

871
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,208
What the fuck?
Here, give it to me.

872
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:14,978
- Be easy!
- Stop! No! Let go.

873
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,980
- It goes this way.
- I know where it goes.

874
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,382
[Thomas] I'm just tryin' to
tell you, I mapped it already.

875
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:20,017
- Make a right!
- It's all right, I got it.

876
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,918
[Thomas] Be quick about it.
Make a right.

877
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:21,885
[Samantha] No!

878
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:24,221
[electricity buzzes]
[Samantha yells]

879
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,255
Come on,
come on!

880
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,591
Easy, there.
You got a right.

881
00:43:27,624 --> 00:43:29,360
- [electricity buzzes]
- [Samantha screams]

882
00:43:29,393 --> 00:43:30,227
- [Thomas] Easy, easy!
- [Dash] Sorry, sorry, sorry.

883
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,261
Left.

884
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:32,463
[Dash] OK!

885
00:43:32,496 --> 00:43:33,931
[Thomas] Make a right.

886
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:35,065
Shit.

887
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,667
[grunts]

888
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,002
You got a right,
and then a left.

889
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:40,070
[electricity buzzes]

890
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:41,405
[Samantha screams]

891
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:42,539
You guys, how you doing
in there?

892
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:44,041
I'm trying, shut up!

893
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:45,242
I'm trying to help you!

894
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:47,277
[electricity hums]
[grunts]

895
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:49,513
[Thomas] Now you gotta make a
right up here and then a left.

896
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:51,215
- [electricity buzzes]
- [Samantha yells]

897
00:43:51,248 --> 00:43:52,616
Come on, you got it.

898
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:54,218
You're close, you're close,
you're close.

899
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:55,619
[Dash] H-hey!
[Cole] You got it!

900
00:43:55,652 --> 00:43:56,887
Let's go!

901
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,089
[cries and moans]

902
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:03,160
Get this off me, man.

903
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:06,930
[Dash] What just happened?

904
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:07,965
I'm so sorry, Sam.

905
00:44:07,998 --> 00:44:08,966
How bad was that?

906
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:10,100
I feel sick.

907
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:14,705
[gasps] That shit wasn't
right, man.

908
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:16,607
That shit wasn't right at all.

909
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,309
Well, Alexei said that this
was gonna be pretty intense.

910
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:21,311
- Fuckin' Alexei, man.
- This place is pretty intense.

911
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:23,247
Y'all think this is funny, huh?

912
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,282
Yo, yo, Sam. It's a game.
It's supposed to be...

913
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:30,020
Fuck that, Cole! This shit don't
feel like no game no more, man.

914
00:44:30,053 --> 00:44:32,089
Sam, if you want to leave,
we can just leave right now.

915
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:33,490
You know I want to leave, man.

916
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:34,725
I don't wanna stay here no
more, Dashell.

917
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:37,194
I wanna go!

918
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:38,429
Look, why is nobody
answering us?

919
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:40,197
I don't know.
Alexei, hello?!

920
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,199
Guys! Hello?! Hello?!

921
00:44:42,232 --> 00:44:43,700
What do you mean you don't
know? This is your guy.

922
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:44,735
- You were just talkin' to him.
- [Dash] yeah.

923
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:46,036
Where's he at now?

924
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:47,604
I don't know him all that well!

925
00:44:47,638 --> 00:44:49,339
- What do you mean you don't know him that well?
- What?

926
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:51,708
I don't know, I met him
and he said he loved his vlogs.

927
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:53,610
He's some rich guy.
He said he did this before.

928
00:44:53,644 --> 00:44:55,112
There's no way
this kid did this, man.

929
00:44:55,145 --> 00:44:56,547
I don't know
what to tell you guys.

930
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,048
All I know is just as much
as you guys.

931
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,550
They change it every
single time.

932
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:00,717
It's intense.

933
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:02,019
But it's a game!

934
00:45:02,052 --> 00:45:04,288
Dash. We're in Russia

935
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:06,089
with some guy
that you barely know

936
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:08,325
in some old prison?
Or wherever we are.

937
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:11,728
Are you fucking crazy?

938
00:45:11,763 --> 00:45:13,697
How could I be
so stupid?

939
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,767
- This is so like you.
- What do you mean? Fuck... Fuck you!

940
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,501
What do you mean
"it's like" me?

941
00:45:17,534 --> 00:45:19,603
You came on this trip, too.
Just fucking chill.

942
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,672
He's probably laughing at you right now.
He's messing with us.

943
00:45:21,705 --> 00:45:23,440
He's not messing with us, Dash.

944
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,009
[Thomas] Guys?

945
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:27,110
What?!

946
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:28,145
[Thomas]
Get over here.

947
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:37,387
Oh, my God. Erin!

948
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:39,189
- [Dash] Shit!
- [Cole] Erin, are you OK?

949
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:40,724
How long do you think
it's gonna take to fill up?

950
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:42,092
[Dash] I don't know, if she's
OK... Are you OK?!

951
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,360
[muffled]

952
00:45:43,393 --> 00:45:44,628
She doesn't know
what's going on.

953
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,663
She didn't even see
what happened to me.

954
00:45:46,697 --> 00:45:47,698
- That's true.
- [Cole] I don't think she can even hear us.

955
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:49,666
Erin! Can you hear us?!

956
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,702
Cole. Can you hear her?

957
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:53,403
Fuck!

958
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:54,338
All right, where did you guys
just start from?

959
00:45:54,371 --> 00:45:56,139
From down there.

960
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:59,076
Our devices hurt but not as bad
as that electric chair.

961
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:00,410
I bet.

962
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:03,313
Alexei, what gives, bro?!
What's next?

963
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,648
Are you even there?

964
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:05,817
Hello?!

965
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,050
Dash, they're not
gonna help us.

966
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:08,118
We're on our own.

967
00:46:14,826 --> 00:46:16,059
OK.

968
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:18,095
This is just like
the other rooms.

969
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:22,165
We need to figure it out and
get her out now!

970
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,267
Now, now, now!

971
00:46:24,434 --> 00:46:26,470
We're gonna be
right back!

972
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:30,407
[Cole] Uh...

973
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,075
What the hell
is this?

974
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:33,377
Ugh.

975
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,849
OK. Uh, three L, five L

976
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,183
Well, it's like that thing
from <i>Die Hard</i>.

977
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:42,152
I mean, then we also did it
at school once, too.

978
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:43,487
What?

979
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,688
Come on, man. We used to
love that movie.

980
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,256
It's an old puzzle.

981
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,859
Well, just, get her out
of there, OK?

982
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,560
- Let's solve it and get her out.
- All right.

983
00:46:49,593 --> 00:46:51,528
OK, I got this, guys.
Use the three-liter jug

984
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:54,231
and the five-liter jug to get
precisely four liters of water.

985
00:46:54,264 --> 00:46:56,400
So first we need to fill up
the five-liter jug.

986
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,672
[Cole] How she doing
over there?

987
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:03,206
[Dash] She's not freaking out,
so that's good.

988
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,475
Great. Now we pour
the five-liter jug

989
00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:08,412
into the three-liter jug.
We need to fill that all the way up.

990
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:09,713
Help me out here.

991
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:10,747
That's in the three-liter.

992
00:47:10,782 --> 00:47:12,149
Try to help me, all right.

993
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:13,483
Thank you.

994
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,753
Careful, we can't waste
any of this.

995
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:18,522
All right, stop.

996
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:21,325
Now.

997
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:22,794
That leaves us with two
liters of water

998
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:24,661
in the five-liter jug.

999
00:47:24,695 --> 00:47:26,296
So now we need to empty out
the entire three-liter jug.

1000
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:29,399
Um...

1001
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:33,470
[Samantha]
Come on, Thomas.

1002
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:35,907
Great. Now quickly.

1003
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,708
Let's put the two liters
in the three-liter jug.

1004
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:38,810
Help me out again?

1005
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:43,380
Great, keep going.

1006
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,149
Yup.

1007
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,718
- All right.
- [Cole] OK.

1008
00:47:47,752 --> 00:47:49,620
[Thomas] Sweet!

1009
00:47:49,653 --> 00:47:51,488
All right. Now two liters are
in the three-liter jug, OK?

1010
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:53,825
Which gives us room
for one more liter.

1011
00:47:53,858 --> 00:47:56,159
Let's fill up the
five-liter jug...

1012
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:03,768
All right. Now time to top off
the three-liter jug.

1013
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:05,402
Last step, guys.
Come on.

1014
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:07,805
Thank you.

1015
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,941
You remember all this from
<i>Die Hard</i>?

1016
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:11,241
And perfect. Stop!

1017
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:12,309
All right, great.

1018
00:48:12,342 --> 00:48:13,878
That should leave us with

1019
00:48:13,911 --> 00:48:17,849
exactly four liters of water
in the five liter jug.

1020
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:19,951
- Come on, Thomas.
- [Thomas] How are we lookin'? How's Erin doing?

1021
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,284
[Cole] You're really
cuttin' it close.

1022
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:22,352
[Thomas] I know, I know.
Hold on.

1023
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:28,558
There.

1024
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:32,396
[gate unlocks]

1025
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:38,535
- [Cole] Oh, my God, Erin!
- [Thomas] Shit!

1026
00:48:38,568 --> 00:48:40,704
[Cole] Erin!
Are you OK?

1027
00:48:40,737 --> 00:48:41,973
[Dash] All right, we need
to get her out of here.

1028
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:43,206
How are we supposed
to do that?!

1029
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,307
[muffled] This is the key!

1030
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:45,442
The key, the key, uh...

1031
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:46,978
Is there a latch
or something?

1032
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:48,278
- [Cole] I don't see anything.
- I don't see any.

1033
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:50,547
Hey, there's a hatch on top!

1034
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,648
OK, uh...

1035
00:48:53,617 --> 00:48:54,852
Here, grab one!

1036
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:57,855
- [Cole] Dash!
- [Dash] She has the key.

1037
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,658
Hold on.

1038
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:09,867
[grunts]

1039
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:13,004
It's rusted shut!

1040
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,705
What do you mean
it's rusted shut?

1041
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:16,540
- It's rusted shut, man!
- It's not rusted shut!

1042
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:17,909
- Just pull harder!
- That's what I'm doing, man!

1043
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:19,010
Turn it! Turn it at the same time.
Come on!

1044
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:20,277
[grunts]

1045
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:22,279
God, fuck!

1046
00:49:22,312 --> 00:49:23,346
Oh, my God.

1047
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:28,652
Come on!

1048
00:49:28,685 --> 00:49:30,320
[Cole] Ah, it should be
fucking opening!

1049
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:32,355
What's going on?

1050
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:33,858
She's gonna fucking drown!

1051
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:35,258
Find something to
break this open, Cole!

1052
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:36,560
Erin!

1053
00:49:38,628 --> 00:49:40,630
[whimpering]

1054
00:49:40,664 --> 00:49:42,566
Fuck. I don't know
what to do.

1055
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:43,835
I don't know what to do.

1056
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:44,936
- [screaming]
- I know.

1057
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:48,371
[Samantha] Cole, she's gonna
fucking drown!

1058
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:50,273
Alexei, what the fuck!

1059
00:49:50,307 --> 00:49:51,441
That's enough!
Stop the game!

1060
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:52,877
We can't get her out!

1061
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,912
Alexei! Victoria!

1062
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:57,647
Stop the game!
We can't get her out!

1063
00:49:57,681 --> 00:49:58,715
Fuck!

1064
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:04,856
Alexei!

1065
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:06,289
Anyone?

1066
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:10,293
[screaming]

1067
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:18,970
Fuck!

1068
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:20,270
Alexei! Anyone!

1069
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:23,507
[Dash] Erin!

1070
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,741
No, no, no, no!

1071
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,379
Alexei! Where the fuck
are you?!

1072
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:33,416
Fuck, man.

1073
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,684
We're never gonna
get this off!

1074
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:40,024
Shit. Shit.

1075
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:44,996
[grunts]

1076
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:47,597
[screams]

1077
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:48,766
Move! Move!

1078
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:52,369
[grunts]

1079
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:54,105
[cries]

1080
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:55,572
Fuck!
[grunts]

1081
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:56,673
[gasps]

1082
00:51:01,678 --> 00:51:02,612
[grunts]

1083
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:03,680
[gasps]

1084
00:51:03,713 --> 00:51:05,783
Erin! [shouting indistinct]

1085
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:08,753
[gasps]

1086
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:11,354
[grunts]

1087
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,992
Help me! Help me!

1088
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:16,093
Help me!

1089
00:51:18,562 --> 00:51:19,629
Erin!

1090
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:26,436
[grunts] Help me!

1091
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:29,073
Yeah. Oh, God.

1092
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,376
Erin! Erin! Erin!

1093
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,678
Slow, slow, slow.

1094
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:36,379
Watch her head.
I don't know.

1095
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:38,548
[Cole] Erin! Erin!

1096
00:51:38,582 --> 00:51:39,583
[Samantha] Oh, my God.

1097
00:51:39,616 --> 00:51:42,019
Erin!

1098
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:43,087
- Erin!
- [Samantha] She's not breathing!

1099
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,454
[Dash] What do we do?

1100
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:45,722
[Samantha]
Give her mouth-to-mouth!

1101
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:47,524
[coughs]

1102
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:49,060
[all] Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, my God!

1103
00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:52,596
Oh!

1104
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:54,698
Get her up, get her up,
get her up.

1105
00:51:54,731 --> 00:51:56,466
[Dash] Thank God
you're OK.

1106
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:57,567
[coughs]

1107
00:52:03,174 --> 00:52:04,441
Thank God, thank God.

1108
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:05,642
[alarm sounds]

1109
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:06,811
What the fuck is that?
Is it over?

1110
00:52:08,445 --> 00:52:10,047
Fuck that.
Are you OK?

1111
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:11,715
[coughs] I'm OK.

1112
00:52:13,184 --> 00:52:14,417
OK, OK. She...
[Erin] I'm OK

1113
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:15,953
- [Cole] You good?
- Uh-huh. OK.

1114
00:52:15,987 --> 00:52:17,654
Fuck!

1115
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:18,789
I don't get it. Why the fuck
didn't they come?

1116
00:52:18,823 --> 00:52:20,557
Why did they say?

1117
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,425
I tried to... I... We
couldn't do anything!

1118
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:24,427
Because Alexei was helping us
and then he was just gone!

1119
00:52:24,461 --> 00:52:26,496
We was yellin' to them the
whole entire time, Erin.

1120
00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:27,530
We... we... Let's go.

1121
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:29,166
[Cole] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,567
Wait, hey, hey. That's...
that's gotta be the key

1123
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,136
for the end
of the hall.

1124
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:34,138
Yeah, let's go.

1125
00:52:34,171 --> 00:52:35,172
Let's go.

1126
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:36,473
- Can you get up?
- Mm-hmm.

1127
00:52:37,808 --> 00:52:39,709
[coughs]

1128
00:52:43,513 --> 00:52:44,581
Fuck this place.

1129
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:54,158
Alexei, what the fuck?

1130
00:53:00,697 --> 00:53:01,698
What the fuck?

1131
00:53:01,731 --> 00:53:02,800
[Dash] Whoa, shit!

1132
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,668
Alexei?

1133
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:06,670
Hello?

1134
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:08,105
[Erin] What the hell is this?

1135
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,206
[Dash] Alexei?

1136
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:11,876
[Thomas] Dash,
the door, the door!

1137
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:12,810
- [Dash] Fuck!
- [Cole] Fuck!

1138
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:13,911
No, no.

1139
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:15,246
[Thomas] What happened here?

1140
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:16,746
I... I don't know.

1141
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:18,883
But whatever it was,
it was bad.

1142
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,517
- We were just talking to Alexei and then he stopped.
- [Erin] OK.

1143
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,086
What if this is
still part of it?

1144
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:23,520
No, fuck, no. We lost.

1145
00:53:23,553 --> 00:53:24,688
Look at the timer.
It's over.

1146
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:26,523
Someone should be here.

1147
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:28,159
Someone should've been here
a long time ago

1148
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:29,760
after what happened in there.

1149
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:32,129
Maybe the audience saw it
on my feed and they're

1150
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:33,764
sending help or...

1151
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:35,665
I don't think so.
I don't see any cameras.

1152
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:37,268
- There's blood on the wall.
- What?!

1153
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:38,568
Fuck!

1154
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:40,603
-[Erin] Cole!

1155
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:43,808
What do we do?

1156
00:53:43,841 --> 00:53:45,142
What do we do?

1157
00:53:45,176 --> 00:53:46,877
Uh, I don't know. Uh...

1158
00:53:46,911 --> 00:53:48,545
It's jammed, the door's locked!

1159
00:53:48,578 --> 00:53:50,081
[Dash] This won't open either.

1160
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:52,216
OK, hold on.
Let me try.

1161
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:53,884
[Cole] Shit!
[Dash] OK, think.

1162
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:55,152
Maybe we can
break the lock.

1163
00:53:55,186 --> 00:53:57,254
OK, hold...

1164
00:53:57,288 --> 00:53:59,223
Maybe we should
stay here.

1165
00:53:59,256 --> 00:54:01,624
[Dash] If there's actual danger,
this is the best place to be.

1166
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:03,526
We'll just wait for the security
to come back.

1167
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,628
[Thomas] Yeah, he's right.
That makes sense.

1168
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:06,730
[Dash] What are you doing?

1169
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:11,634
Cole.

1170
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:15,806
[all] Cole! Cole! Wait! No!

1171
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,241
Dude, what the fuck?!

1172
00:54:17,274 --> 00:54:18,742
We're getting out of there now.

1173
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:19,877
Fuck that, I'm not
going out there.

1174
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,145
None of us should.

1175
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:22,746
Everybody, listen.

1176
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,782
We don't have any
identification.

1177
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:26,183
We are in a strange country.

1178
00:54:26,217 --> 00:54:27,717
We don't have our phones,
our wallets,

1179
00:54:27,752 --> 00:54:29,619
our passports, anything.

1180
00:54:29,652 --> 00:54:31,654
We need to leave now!

1181
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,190
We're gonna stick together
and find help!

1182
00:54:33,224 --> 00:54:34,557
[Erin screams]

1183
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:35,658
Oh, what the fuck?!

1184
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,294
Oh, my God.

1185
00:54:37,328 --> 00:54:40,865
[woman cries]

1186
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,835

[speaks Russian]

1189
00:54:55,312 --> 00:54:56,579
- [speaks Russian]
- [Dash] No, no, no! Wait!

1190
00:54:57,882 --> 00:54:58,849
[screams]

1191
00:54:58,883 --> 00:55:00,051
Oh, my God!

1192
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:02,820
[grunts]
[Cole] Erin? Thomas?

1193
00:55:02,853 --> 00:55:04,088
[speaks Russian]

1194
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:05,588
[Cole] What are you
doing to us?

1195
00:55:05,622 --> 00:55:07,324
What do you want?
Where's Alexei?

1196
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,662
[speaks Russian]

1197
00:55:12,695 --> 00:55:14,965
[Cole] What do you want
with us?

1198
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:17,968
[Cole] Let go of me!
Where are my friends?

1199
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:20,670
[speaks Russian]

1200
00:55:20,703 --> 00:55:21,972
[Erin] Oh, my God.

1201
00:55:30,014 --> 00:55:31,048
Oh, my God.

1202
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:35,986
[grunts]

1203
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,288
[speaks Russian]

1204
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:40,657
Hello, Cole.

1205
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:42,927
Who... who is that?

1206
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:45,662
How do you know my name?

1207
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:51,936
[gasps]

1208
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,907
Who are you?

1209
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:59,376
What is this?

1210
00:56:01,312 --> 00:56:02,379
Oh, my God.

1211
00:56:03,713 --> 00:56:06,283
Please, please, please.

1212
00:56:07,952 --> 00:56:10,387
[man] You fucking Americans.

1213
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:15,426
This is... this is a mistake.

1214
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,760
[man] You think you're so safe?

1215
00:56:16,794 --> 00:56:17,895
M-misunderstanding.

1216
00:56:17,928 --> 00:56:19,296
[man] Mm?

1217
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,730
I don't know...
I don't know who you are.

1218
00:56:20,764 --> 00:56:23,334
When a man is shot
in the head,

1219
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:25,369
there's so much blood.

1220
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:29,773

[Dash] <i>Yeah, we got drinks,

01:24:42,532 --> 01:24:44,401
[chatter and laughter]

1585
01:24:44,434 --> 01:24:46,703
[Alexei] <i>Every experience
is tailored to the player.</i>

1586
01:24:46,736 --> 01:24:47,905
[Dash] Oh, my God.

1587
01:24:47,939 --> 01:24:49,774

1588
01:24:52,442 --> 01:24:53,945
[cries]

1589
01:24:53,978 --> 01:24:56,680
[murmuring]
Oh, my...

1590
01:24:56,713 --> 01:24:59,083
[Igor on recording] <i>I need
to have you back by eight!</i>

1591
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:02,385
<i>This is yours.</i>

1592
01:25:05,122 --> 01:25:07,959
[Cole on recording] <i>That's enough!
Stop the game! We can't get her out!</i>

1593
01:25:07,992 --> 01:25:09,526
Oh, my God.

1594
01:25:09,559 --> 01:25:11,528
[Cole on recording]
<i>Where are you!</i>

1595
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:15,432
<i>Help! Fuck!</i>

1596
01:25:27,144 --> 01:25:30,714
[gasps]

1597
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:39,757
[man on recording] <i>Erin, Samantha, Dash.
We're taking you...</i>

1598
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,458
- [Cole panting]
- [Dash on recording] <i>So sick!</i>

1599
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:45,796
<i>Ah!</i>

1600
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:47,731
[laughter]

1601
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:53,536
[panting] What the fuck?

1602
01:25:58,109 --> 01:26:03,114
[panting heavily]

1603
01:26:12,656 --> 01:26:15,126
Hey, babe.
Where are you?

1604
01:26:15,159 --> 01:26:16,660
Oh, great, you're almost here.

1605
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:18,095
We'll see you
in a second. Bye.

1606
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:19,629
He just pulled
in the driveway.

1607
01:26:22,767 --> 01:26:24,035
[Cole] You want anything?

1608
01:26:24,068 --> 01:26:25,535
No, I'm good.

1609
01:26:25,568 --> 01:26:27,637
FaceTime Thomas.

1610
01:26:27,671 --> 01:26:29,106
- <i>Hey, what up, Dash?</i>
- All right, so he still doesn't know.

1611
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,641
So just tell everybody to keep
it on the low.

1612
01:26:31,675 --> 01:26:33,210
<i>Dude, this is gonna be crazy.
He's not gonna even see it coming.</i>

1613
01:26:33,244 --> 01:26:34,845
When's the last time you
guys even seen each other?

1614
01:26:34,879 --> 01:26:36,479
<i>Must've been some years, bro.</i>

1615
01:26:36,513 --> 01:26:38,115
OK, I'm gonna have to
let you go. He's coming.

1616
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:39,716
<i>OK, sounds good.
I'll see you soon.</i>

1617
01:26:39,749 --> 01:26:40,851
All right, see you, bud.

1618
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:46,824
What's up, guys? Dash here.
And check this out.

1619
01:26:46,857 --> 01:26:48,491
- We just picked up Thomas!
- Hey!

1620
01:26:48,525 --> 01:26:50,094
He still has no idea.

1621
01:26:50,127 --> 01:26:51,661
[Dash] We got Alexei.

1622
01:26:51,695 --> 01:26:53,530
<i>Hey. See you soon.</i>
[speaks Russian]

1623
01:26:57,201 --> 01:26:58,836
It'll be so crazy.
Oh, my gosh.

1624
01:26:58,869 --> 01:27:02,139
I can't believe he
just has no idea.

1625
01:27:02,173 --> 01:27:03,740
- You don't think he does?
- What's up?

1626
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:08,212
[Dash] He's gonna know
that this is fake.

1627
01:27:08,245 --> 01:27:10,815
[man] He won't, trust me.
I'm taking care of everything.

1628
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:15,119
[Erin] Aren't we worried
this isn't too much?

1629
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:17,755
[Dash] He's always looking for
something to actually scare him, right?

1630
01:27:17,788 --> 01:27:19,757
If we pull this off,
this is it.

1631
01:27:20,925 --> 01:27:23,294
<i>There's no turning back now.
Remember, dude. We love you.</i>

1632
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:25,229
This is crazy even for you.

1633
01:27:25,262 --> 01:27:26,897
- [Dash chuckles]
- You'll love it, bro.

1634
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:28,165
- All right, man, good luck.
- Peace.

1635
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:29,233
Peace.
