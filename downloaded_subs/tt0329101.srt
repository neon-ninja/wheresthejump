3
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,359
from the very beginning...

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,928
it was the children
who gave me my power.

5
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:41,032
The Springwood Slasher...

6
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,066
that's what they called me.

7
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,494
My reign of terror
was legendary.

8
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,701
Dozens of children
would fall by my blades.

9
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:22,138
Then the parents of Springwood
came for me...

10
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:32,155
taking justice
into their own hands.

11
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,358
When I was alive, I might
have been a little naughty...

12
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,196
but after they killed me,

13
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,692
I became something much,
much worse--

14
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,865
the stuff nightmares
are made of.

15
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,475
The children
still feared me...

16
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,606
and their fear gave me the power
to invade their dreams.

17
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:58,016
And that's when the fun
really began!

18
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:06,793
Until they figured out
a way to forget about me...

19
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,853
to erase me completely!

20
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,694
Being dead wasn't a problem.

21
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,963
But being forgotten--
now, that's a bitch!

22
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,203
It's only a dream!

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,730
Die, motherfucker!

24
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,006
I can't come back
if nobody remembers me!

25
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:29,379
I can't come back
if nobody's afraid!

26
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,251
I had to search the bowels of hell...

27
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,192
but I found someone...

28
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,993
someone who'll make 'em remember.

29
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:48,695
He may get the blood,
but I'll get the glory.

30
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:53,230
And that fear is my ticket home.

31
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,735
Mike?

32
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,511
Is that you?

33
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,148
All right, fuck you, then.

34
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,174
I'm heading in.

35
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,127
Mike?

36
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,195
Come on, it's not funny anymore.

37
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,253
No!

38
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,700
Jason.

39
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:13,311
I should've been watching
them, not drinking...

40
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,338
not meeting a boy
at the lake.

41
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,144
I deserve to be punished.

42
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,677
We all deserved
to be punished.

43
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,418
Jason.

44
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,488
My special, special boy.

45
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,896
Do you know what
your gift is?

46
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,490
No matter what they do to you...

47
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,661
you cannot die.

48
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,193
You can never die.

49
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,765
You've just been
sleeping, honey.

50
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:46,871
But now the time
has come to wake up.

51
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,075
Mommy has something
she wants you to do.

52
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,347
I need you to go
to Elm Street.

53
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:00,122
The children have been
very bad on Elm Street.

54
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,788
Rise up, Jason!

55
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,128
Your work isn't finished!

56
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,000
Hear my voice and live again!

57
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,373
Make them remember me, Jason.

58
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,477
Make them remember
what fear tastes like.

59
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:33,883
I've been away from my children
for far too long.

60
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,036
Marry, fuck, or kill?
Your choices are--

61
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,628
your choices
are the Three Stooges.

62
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,832
Go, Kia.

63
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,205
Oh, God...

64
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,370
Which one had
the super-bad toupee hair?

65
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,471
Harry, Mar--

66
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,311
No! No, no, no.
It was Moe.

67
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,216
Either one, I'd kill him.

68
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,344
OK, who'd you fuck, then?

69
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,684
This is stupid, y'all.

70
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,484
Come on. Come on.

71
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,649
Oh, God. Whatever, look.

72
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,181
I'd fuck the bald guy,
and I'd marry Larry.

73
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,456
Jesus. Is this what
we're doing all night?

74
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,861
'Cause, y'all,
this is really stank.

75
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,161
Hey! Gibb, what are you doing?

76
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,223
I thought you were gonna quit.

77
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,825
I only smoke when I drink now.

78
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,496
But you're always drinking.

79
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,164
Yeah, well, I'll work
on that next.

80
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,670
Hey, OK.

81
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,675
I got another one.

82
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,507
Fred, Scooby, or Shaggy?

83
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,911
Oh! I'm not answering that
and neither is she.

84
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,745
Do you guys think
I should get a nose job?

85
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,978
Oh, my God.

86
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,646
Oh, please, Kia, what you need
is a lobotomy.

87
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,318
I think I'm gonna
get some candles.

88
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,988
I'm gonna get some beer.
Do you guys want anything?

89
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,994
Are you sure you
should be driving?

90
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,830
I'm so under the limit, Lori.

91
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,296
Surprise.

92
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,964
Oh, Trey.
You answered my prayers.

93
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:26,995
Thank you.

94
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,975
Whoa, babe!

95
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,135
What'd I tell you
about kissing me...

96
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,474
after you've smoked, huh?

97
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,138
Lighten up.
They're menthols.

98
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,478
Yeah. I brought Blake.
Where's Linda?

99
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,914
It's Lori.

100
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,316
This is her house,
so don't be a total cocksmith.

101
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,341
Whatever.

102
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,182
Where are the ladies?

103
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,921
Relax, they'll be here.

104
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,485
I'm relaxed, man.
I'm just wet.

105
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,326
Did you know they
were coming over?

106
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,832
Listen, you gotta be quiet.

107
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,165
Hey, we knew you were be here
all alone this weekend.

108
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,172
Blake's cute.

109
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,072
He's not my type.

110
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,508
Oh! Who is? No one's
ever gonna live up...

111
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,535
to the fuzzy memory
of your first love, Lori.

112
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,377
You were fucking fourteen,
so get over it.

113
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,939
Yeah, I know
we were young...

114
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,076
but what Will and l
had was real.

115
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,110
Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

116
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,816
but didn't Mr. Real
just drop-kick your ass...

117
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,757
without so much
as a good-bye handshake?

118
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,489
He ever even call or maybe even
write to you after he moved?

119
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,791
Send you an e-mail?

120
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,161
No.

121
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,257
You see my point?

122
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,495
It's time to leave
the convent, Lori.

123
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,265
You need to meet a guy.

124
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,419
Hey, Lori...

125
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,723
I like the...
flow of your place.

126
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,695
Got good feng shui.

127
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,595
Yeah.

128
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,698
You know about feng shui?

129
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,107
Oh, oh!

130
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,110
Oh, you should see her bedroom!

131
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,942
-Hmm?
-Great flow in there.

132
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,710
Lori, why don't you go upstairs
and show Blake your feng shui?

133
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,081
Shut up!

134
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,047
I got a kink in my neck.

135
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,751
Come on.
You can massage it out for me.

136
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,118
I think I need
a few more drinks...

137
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,426
before there'll be
any massaging.

138
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,395
What do you see in him?

139
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,369
I don't know,
but he has a cute ass.

140
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,805
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

141
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,342
So, Lori...

142
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,406
am I gonna get that
grand tour or what?

143
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,748
Yeah.

144
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,310
You know, why don't you
start in the kitchen...

145
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,514
and get us some beers?

146
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,920
Cool.

147
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,324
Oh, my God, Kia,
he is a total idiot.

148
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,352
Get him out of here.

149
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,661
Oh, Lori, come on,
give him a chance.

150
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,860
I don't like him.

151
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,869
You know what?
You don't like anybody.

152
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,632
I mean, Lori, you've
barely gone out since--

153
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,798
Since what?
Since my mom died?

154
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,535
Yeah, well, you know what?
My dad needs me.

155
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,566
So I can't just go out
with guys all the time...

156
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,910
and if I did, it would not be
with somebody like Blake.

157
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,516
Yeah, fuck me, baby!

158
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,472
Your back door was open.

159
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,599
I closed it.

160
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,074
Mmm.

161
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:27,546
Babe, you know I don't like
to be touched after, OK?

162
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,242
Fine. I'll go have
a shower then.

163
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,551
Good.

164
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,919
Your hair smells like
menthols, anyway.

165
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,652
Asshole.

166
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,414
Trey!

167
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,283
What the hell are you doing?

168
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,097
Help us! Help us!

169
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,837
Oh, my God!

170
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,107
Over here!

171
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,046
Please help us!

172
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,048
Help us!

173
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,413
You kids need
some assistance?

174
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,543
What the fuck
do you think?!

175
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,485
We need to lock this down now.

176
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,045
Keep it contained, you hear me?

177
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,613
Killed in bed.

178
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,387
Jesus.

179
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,861
It's even the same damn house.

180
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,386
1428 Elm.

181
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,262
It's gotta be him, right?

182
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,857
It's gotta be
Freddy Krueger.

183
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,868
Hey! Don't even say...

184
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:29,869
that son of a bitch's
name out loud.

185
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,098
Let's just keep it together.

186
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,606
We've been through too much
to let this thing spread now.

187
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,131
Take all the kids
down to the station.

188
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,700
Keep them separate.
Do it now.

189
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,143
Yes, sir.

190
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,441
We'll be in touch.

191
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,471
Thank you.
Let's go home.

192
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,652
So?

193
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:49,916
She doesn't know anything.

194
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,447
None of them do.

195
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,584
I'm pretty sure we're good.

196
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,685
Pretty sure?
You better make damn sure...

197
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,888
none of those kids
knows anything...

198
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,296
or I'll send your ass up
to Westin Hills with them.

199
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,731
Knows what?
What do you mean?

200
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,701
Good work there tonight, Stubbs.

201
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,828
Right place, right time.

202
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,771
But we'll take it
from here, all right?

203
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,746
Your father's on his way.

204
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:17,909
Do they know who did this?

205
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,010
No, not yet.

206
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,179
But I thought I heard...

207
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,916
one of the officers
mention a name.

208
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,548
You know, to tell
you the truth, Lori...

209
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,786
I--I just moved here
about a month ago...

210
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,226
but if they have a suspect,
I'd be the first to know.

211
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,025
But they asked me all these
really weird questions...

212
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,361
Iike about my dreams--

213
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,636
What was the name?

214
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,402
What was the name?

215
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,180
Freddy.

216
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,469
Hello?

217
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,250
Are you OK?

218
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,131
His name is Freddy Krueger...

219
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:20,936
and he loves children,
especially little girls.

220
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,568
Freddy's coming back.

221
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,238
Soon he'll be strong enough.

222
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,612
It's OK to be afraid.

223
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,742
We were all afraid.

224
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,276
Warn your friends.
Warn everyone.

225
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:49,624
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you

226
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,435
Three, four,
better lock the door

227
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:57,807
Five, six, grab a crucifix

228
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,678
Seven, eight,
try to stay up late

229
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,810
Nine, ten, never sleep again

230
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:10,380
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you...

231
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,021
Blake, we have to talk.

232
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,364
What the hell were you
doing over there?

233
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,773
You were supposed to be
watching your sister.

234
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,334
Were you drinking?

235
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,347
My best friend was
just killed, Dad!

236
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:39,078
So how about giving me
some fucking space?

237
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,014
You watch yourself, boy.

238
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,336
I'm gonna get him for you, Trey.

239
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,703
Cop let it slip.

240
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,298
It was somebody named Freddy.

241
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,436
I'm gonna take him out
myself, Trey.

242
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,777
I swear to God.

243
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,326
Who is that?

244
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,163
Someone there?

245
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,569
Jesus.

246
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,115
I'm OK. I'm all right.

247
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,859
Not strong enough yet.

248
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:00,388
Well, I will be soon enough.

249
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,698
Until then...

250
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,933
I'll let Jason have some fun.

251
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,411
Dad?

252
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,170
Hypnocil.
What does this shit do, anyway?

253
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,839
How come we all
have to take it?

254
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,577
It keeps you nice and docile
while I kick your little ass.

255
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,679
I'm fine with that.

256
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,255
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

257
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,262
After tonight's murder...

258
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,127
in this neighborhood
of Springwood...

259
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,825
the Sheriff's Department
has confirmed...

260
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,857
that there is one victim...

261
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,163
Hey, turn that up, man.

262
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,262
Remain sketchy,
but the sheriff--

263
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,830
Sorry, Will.
You know the rules.

264
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,898
Turn that back on.

265
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,206
I know somebody
that lives in that house.

266
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,109
Come on, turn it back on, man!

267
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,443
I never ask for anything.

268
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,006
Just turn on
the fucking TV, please!

269
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,620
Fuck you, man!

270
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,815
What the fuck is your problem?

271
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,051
What are you doing, man?

272
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,423
You want 10ccs of that pink
tranquilizer in your ass?

273
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,052
That was Lori's house.

274
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,995
They said something
about a murder.

275
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,122
I gotta go to her.

276
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,792
I gotta see if she's OK.

277
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,892
Back to Springwood?

278
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,199
Do you want me to start
having nightmares again?

279
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,206
Don't start with that
dream demon shit again.

280
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,869
OK? You know that's all
just in your head.

281
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,277
Yeah, yeah, and who are you,
the poster boy for sanity?

282
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,302
You're the one
that told the cops...

283
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,940
Lori's dad killed his wife.

284
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,541
Yeah, right, and now it
looks like someone else...

285
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,710
got killed in the same house.

286
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,276
You think that's
a coincidence?

287
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,845
Two murders in one house?

288
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,291
Kurt, how many times
do I have to tell you, man?

289
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,021
I don't do checkers.

290
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,052
I'm an UNO guy, all right?

291
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:15,033
So go grab the fucking UNO deck
and we'll play, OK?

292
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,466
Please. Thank you.

293
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,134
Look at us, Will.

294
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,199
Look around you, man.

295
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,234
We're institutionalized.

296
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,941
We're stuck here.
We're not going anywhere.

297
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,019
I do miss my family, man.

298
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:48,057
I mean, it's been four years
since I've seen 'em, you know.

299
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,000
All these years,
and you're still convinced...

300
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,401
you saw her father do that?

301
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,234
I know what I saw, Mark.

302
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,400
Fuck what the doctors try
to get me to believe.

303
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,433
I need to know if she's OK.

304
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,388
You want to play?

305
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,737
Sweet dreams, monkey boy.

306
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,779
What the hell
was that for, man?

307
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,615
Heh heh heh!

308
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,490
You're a fucking lunatic,
you know that?

309
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,052
I know you are,
but what am l?

310
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,274
Are you sure
you didn't see anyone?

311
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,409
No, Dad, none of us did.

312
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,386
I already went over this
with the police.

313
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:24,653
It's just...

314
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,631
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

315
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,190
You're all I have left.

316
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,030
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

317
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,707
I promise.

318
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,039
Look at you.

319
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,339
You're exhausted.

320
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,074
Lori.

321
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,241
We need to get you to bed!

322
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,112
I don't want to
go to sleep, Dad.

323
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,679
I just want to see my friends.

324
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,521
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to go to school today.

325
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,584
You've just been through
a very traumatic experience.

326
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,926
Dad, please...

327
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,488
I just need to get
out of the house, OK?

328
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,866
I'll be fine.
I promise.

329
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,044
Well, at least drink your juice.

330
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,883
Will Rollins
and the Davis boy...

331
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,819
escaped from Westin Hills
last night.

332
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,118
Oh, Jesus.

333
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,420
It's all coming apart again.

334
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,087
Don't worry.
We'll find them.

335
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,187
Keep this thing contained.

336
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,604
Lori!

337
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,976
Oh, my God! God, you guys,
I'm so glad you're here.

338
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,878
Blake's dead, too.

339
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,042
What?

340
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,382
Yeah, he--

341
00:25:56,088 --> 00:26:00,047
He was stabbed
to death late last night.

342
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,219
Same with his dad.

343
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,990
What?

344
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,000
Shit, shit!
This is bullshit!

345
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,558
The police are blaming
everything on Blake...

346
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,628
Iike its some kind
of Columbine thing or something.

347
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,434
They're saying he went crazy.

348
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,499
Killed Trey, killed his dad,
and then took his own life?

349
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,773
This is so fucking messed up.

350
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,336
This is messed up.

351
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,181
Excuse me. Sorry.

352
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,706
Lori?

353
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,218
What is it, Linderman?

354
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,720
Um, well, I heard
what happened,

355
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,619
and I just wanted to
express how, um...

356
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,250
well, to tell you
how sorry I was.

357
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,556
Thank you.
That's sweet.

358
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,495
Right. Actually if you need
anybody to talk to or maybe--

359
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,692
Whoa, Linderman,
let me give you a tip.

360
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,667
Place your hormones
back in the box...

361
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,293
and quit while
you're ahead, OK?

362
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,167
We don't have time
for Date-a-Dork right now.

363
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,365
Thanks.

364
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,370
Right. Sorry.

365
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,309
I swear, every day
it's the same thing.

366
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,902
He's like one of those
fucking froufrou dogs...

367
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,379
that keeps humping your leg.

368
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,548
Give a couple to some ladies.

369
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,846
Thanks, man.

370
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:00,852
I see what
you're saying, Gibb...

371
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:01,910
but that's exactly
why you should go.

372
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,683
I mean, be amongst friends,
where it's safe.

373
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,019
There's gonna be a whole lot
of loving there for you...

374
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,218
and my boy Trey, all right?

375
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,954
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I should go.

376
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,791
I could use a few dozen drinks.

377
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,797
That a girl.

378
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,628
Let your freak flag fly.

379
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,258
See you there.

380
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,290
You want to go?

381
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,235
No, I don't think so.

382
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,738
I--I didn't get much
sleep last night...

383
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,240
and when I did sleep...

384
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,901
I had the most
terrible nightmares.

385
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,104
Lori, you had to sleep
at a police station.

386
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,510
I'd have nightmares, too.

387
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,070
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that.

388
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,048
I mean, this was really real.

389
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,710
I mean, there was this man...

390
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,776
but he more like
a monster really...

391
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,185
and they kept
calling him Freddy...

392
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,019
-and he was so real.
-Shh!

393
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,422
What did he look like?

394
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,256
He--he had this...

395
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,125
dark brown hat, and...

396
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,563
his skin was
terribly burnt...

397
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,931
and on this right hand
he had this like these...

398
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,458
razor fingers, and--

399
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,799
You must be tripping.

400
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,997
No, no, no!

401
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,437
And then there were
these little girls...

402
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,270
It's OK.
It was a bad dream.

403
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,640
They were singing like
this--this song like--

404
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,808
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you.

405
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,942
You know why they sing that?

406
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,545
Because that's when
he comes for you...

407
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,555
in your dreams.

408
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,750
You're lucky to be alive.

409
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,019
Who is he?

410
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,617
He's a child murderer...

411
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,720
that some parents
from around here burned alive...

412
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,027
but then he came back.

413
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,398
Back for revenge
in our nightmares.

414
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,096
Funny no one ever
told us about him, huh?

415
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,365
-OK, thank you!
-No!

416
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,497
You want some free advice?

417
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,370
Coffee.
Make friends with it.

418
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,966
Mark!

419
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,170
That's enough.

420
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,236
You're scaring her.

421
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:41,446
Will?

422
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,648
Hey.

423
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,251
I thought you might
be in trouble, so we--

424
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,786
Lori! Oh, my God!

425
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,956
Lori, honey, wake up!

426
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,466
Someone get help, please!

427
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,093
Someone get some help, please!

428
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:01,129
The principal!
Will, let's go, let's go!

429
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,936
Please, somebody help her.
Lori?

430
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,783
How much longer
is it gonna take?

431
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,446
-ls she OK or what?
-Shh!

432
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,284
Tsk!

433
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,345
For nose jobs,
what kind of anesthesia...

434
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,009
do the doctors use?

435
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,711
They put you
all the way under, right?

436
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,830
Got your nose!

437
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,500
Strong work, man.

438
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,669
I came to make sure she's OK...

439
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,043
and you put her
in the infirmary.

440
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,174
What were you
thinking about...

441
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,982
telling her
all that stuff, man?

442
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,249
I mean, we're not in group.

443
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,448
Because I'm thinking
for the first time in my life...

444
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,390
that maybe I'm not crazy...

445
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,915
that my brother wasn't crazy.

446
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,928
She had the same dream, Will.

447
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,930
Will Rollins!
Mark Davis!

448
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,774
This doesn't make any sense.

449
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,208
There's nothing on Krueger.

450
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:48,270
Not his arrest, his death,
not even a birth certificate.

451
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,043
Whole sections of
the records are gone.

452
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,382
Look at all these
blacked-out obituaries.

453
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,090
January eighteenth.

454
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:07,428
That's the day my brother
committed suicide.

455
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,457
Why isn't that in here?

456
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,167
I don't know!

457
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,538
But I'm sure there's
a good reason.

458
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,500
Remember in group
when they told us...

459
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,910
not to jump to conclusions?

460
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:22,106
Listen to yourself.

461
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,978
You're holding onto
that psychobabble bullshit...

462
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,576
Iike it's some kind of
security blanket, man.

463
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:30,247
Let it go.
They've covered him up, Will.

464
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,722
They never told us
about Freddy...

465
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,657
because that's how they
decided to beat him.

466
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,593
They treated him like he
was a fucking disease...

467
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,652
and they locked up
all the kids...

468
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:38,663
who had made
contact with him...

469
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,426
so they wouldn't
infect the others.

470
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:41,660
That's crazy.

471
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,168
Is it?

472
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:46,467
How come we were
never allowed...

473
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,973
to call any of
our friends, man?

474
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,407
How come none of our
friends ever called us?

475
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,469
We were in a fucking
quarantine, man.

476
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,981
That's what
Westin Hills was for.

477
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,381
Well, even if all
you're saying is true...

478
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,818
then why didn't
Freddy kill Lori?

479
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:04,414
Maybe he's not
strong enough yet.

480
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,084
My brother said it's our fear
that gives him his power.

481
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,457
Yeah, well,
you sure as hell...

482
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,985
spread enough fear
today at school.

483
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,020
Holy shit.

484
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,631
You're right.

485
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,834
They wanted to forget Freddy so
they wouldn't fear him.

486
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,469
What if I screwed up
the town's plan?

487
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,543
Fuck! This fucker's gonna spread
like the plague, man!

488
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,812
Kids are gonna start
falling asleep, it's gonna--

489
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,284
Let's leave, man.
Let's leave right now.

490
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,286
No, I can't leave.

491
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,480
Why not?

492
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,456
I gotta go talk to Lori.
I gotta see if she's OK.

493
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,787
Well, is she worth dying for?

494
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,350
Because if you fall asleep,
you ain't waking up.

495
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,693
If that's the case,
how come you're not dead?

496
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,925
Or any of the freaks at Westin?

497
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,196
When's the last time
you even had a nightmare?

498
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,725
I don't know.

499
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,704
I can't remember
my dreams anymore.

500
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,266
Look, just give me
one night, OK?

501
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,245
Just let me find Lori,
and then we're out of here.

502
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,739
I swear.

503
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,076
All right.

504
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,916
If your ass isn't back here by
dawn, I'm gone.

505
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,980
We clear on that?

506
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:15,858
This baby's my brother's
pride and joy, so be careful.

507
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,584
Oh, shit.

508
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:50,617
Linderman!

509
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,722
Shack, I don't drink.

510
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,578
Hi, Lori. Didn't think
I'd see you here.

511
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,317
Can I get you
something to drink?

512
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,986
Smooth opening, but, you know,
we're already taken care of.

513
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,359
What happened
to your clothes?

514
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,489
Oh, this.

515
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,623
I was playing
a drinking game...

516
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,999
with some
of the lower primates...

517
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,526
and I guess I'm penalized
for my ability...

518
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,198
to read above
a fourth-grade level.

519
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,968
Linderman, you know,
I always pictured you...

520
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:38,499
as a straight up bedwetter.

521
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,511
You know what, Kia?

522
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,012
I used to think you hated me...

523
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,776
because you thought
I wasn't good enough for Lori...

524
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,077
but that's not it.

525
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,347
You tear me down
to make yourself feel better...

526
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,785
because you really
hate yourself...

527
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,515
which is kind of pathetic
when you actually...

528
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,715
stop and think about it,
assuming, of course...

529
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,588
you can think
with all that makeup...

530
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,650
weighing down your head.

531
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,624
The cops said Blake
committed suicide.

532
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,227
Apparently,
it was grief over Trey.

533
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,498
No, man, that's bullshit.

534
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,506
I heard some guy Krueger
killed them both.

535
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,508
Said his name to my parents,
they almost shit themselves.

536
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:11,509
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
and I heard...

537
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,010
that Freddy freak,
he used to live here.

538
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:15,479
Fucking gutted Trey like
a Goddamn turkey, man.

539
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:19,450
Like I heard his intestines and
shit was on the floor--

540
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,647
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

541
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,384
Oh, my God.

542
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:30,020
Look who's here.
Look who's here!

543
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,563
What are you looking at?

544
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,904
Come on, come on, let's dance.

545
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,376
Come on, Linderman, let's go.

546
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,402
Where have you been, Will?

547
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,176
Didn't you get my letters?

548
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,580
What letters?

549
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,585
They must've never
even mailed them.

550
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,588
Who?

551
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:01,888
The...doctors at Westin Hills.

552
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,358
I've been in
a psychiatric hospital.

553
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,865
Mark was with me there.

554
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,663
Some other kids, too.

555
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,693
I don't understand.

556
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,667
Well, I saw on the news
the other night...

557
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,801
I mean, that kid that was
killed at your house.

558
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,608
I mean, I needed to know
that you were safe.

559
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,238
What happened?

560
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,771
I don't know.
I don't know.

561
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,681
Nobody knows.
Nobody saw what happened...

562
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,185
and the police have been
acting really weird...

563
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,653
Iike they know something...

564
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,849
and I heard them
mention some name.

565
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,619
Some...

566
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,058
Freddy. Freddy Krueger.

567
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,959
Where was your dad?

568
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,429
Out of town.

569
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,761
Are you sure?

570
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,391
What is going on, Will?

571
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,095
Well, look, four years ago,
I thought l--

572
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,296
Enough with
this bullshit talk.

573
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,305
Let's go shake our ass
on the dance floor.

574
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,636
Come on!

575
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,059
I'm dead one day...

576
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,119
and you're already out
getting shit-faced?

577
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,289
Same old Gibb!

578
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,960
Trey, l--
I can't believe it.

579
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,731
Come on, let's go.

580
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:24,333
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

581
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,841
Now!

582
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,757
Trey?

583
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,405
No!

584
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,273
Open the door!

585
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,141
Please, the door--

586
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,281
No! No!

587
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,043
You're the one
that killed Trey!

588
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,747
Oh, don't worry about
my little errand boy.

589
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:54,487
The only to fear
is fear himself!

590
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,078
No!

591
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,274
She's mine.

592
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,651
Mine! Mine!

593
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:41,190
This everclear
is kicking my ass.

594
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,256
This--

595
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,239
Check out this fucking guy.

596
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,511
Well, hey, Jethro!

597
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,577
This is a rave,
not a Halloween party.

598
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,522
Why don't you go
find yourself a pig to fuck?

599
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,116
Yeah!

600
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,560
Invite only, cornpoke,
and you weren't invite--

601
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,655
Son of a bitch.

602
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:24,900
Yeah!

603
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,776
Burn, motherfucker!

604
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,659
No!

605
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:17,850
Run, man, run!

606
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:32,434
Freak!
You killed my brother!

607
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,289
Gibb! Oh, my God!

608
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,191
Oh, Gibb! No!

609
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,695
Let's go!
Let's go, come on!

610
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,463
Was that him?

611
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,735
The guy you were talking about--
Freddy Krueger.

612
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:04,503
No, that wasn't
the guy in my dream.

613
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:05,566
That was somebody else!

614
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,511
Who cares about some
fucking dream guy, OK?

615
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:10,411
That psycho
in the hockey mask was real.

616
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,746
Dude, that goalie was
pissed about something.

617
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:13,944
We need to find the police.

618
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,283
No, no! Fuck the police!

619
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,845
Just take me home, Will.

620
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,090
Gibb, l--

621
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,601
I can't believe she...

622
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:32,796
I know.

623
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,368
Look, call me later, OK?
Please.

624
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,935
Just to check in.

625
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,753
Bye, Will.

626
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,221
Be careful.

627
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:12,576
Will, I'm gonna go inside now.

628
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,545
I think that's the last thing
you should do right now.

629
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,343
Oh, Will, please.

630
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,474
After everything
that's happened...

631
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,483
I just want to go to--

632
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:22,247
There's more
to it than that.

633
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:25,814
Look, I tried to tell
you this earlier.

634
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,449
The reason
I was sent to Westin...

635
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:31,929
is because I saw
your dad kill your mom.

636
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,622
Will, my mom died
in a car accident.

637
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,067
No, that's what he
wanted you to believe...

638
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,296
but I was there, Lori.

639
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,602
I was sneaking up to your room,
like I used to do.

640
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,471
Only you weren't there.

641
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:49,511
I saw him kill her.

642
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,283
Dad!

643
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:53,750
Get out of the van.

644
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,412
Get out of the van!
Where were you?

645
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,420
What are you doing?

646
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,853
I've been looking
all over for you!

647
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,049
Get away from her!

648
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,421
You're in a helluva
lot of trouble, you know that?

649
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,016
Like I give
a shit anymore.

650
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,254
Get in the house!

651
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:04,556
You! I'm taking you
back to Westin.

652
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,586
No! No way!
You can't trust him, Lori.

653
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,428
Whatever you do,
don't go home with him!

654
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,093
No, listen to me!

655
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,068
He was the one
who had me committed!

656
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,627
You didn't understand.

657
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:15,161
You still don't.
You were confused!

658
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,173
Stop it!

659
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,799
Both of you, stop it!

660
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:19,434
Damn it, Will!
I am not gonna let you...

661
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,342
endanger my daughter again!

662
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,609
Not after everything
that's happened!

663
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,946
Stop it! Stop it! Fuck!

664
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:28,384
Lori!

665
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,653
I--l--

666
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:38,628
Did Mom die
in a car accident?

667
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,824
Yes. Of course she did.

668
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:42,332
Prove it.

669
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:43,994
Show me a death certificate.

670
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,367
Show me an autopsy report.

671
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,998
Lori, I don't think now
is the right time--

672
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,007
Really, Dad?

673
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,804
Because I think
it's a perfect time!

674
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,504
Why didn't you tell me
about Westin Hills?

675
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,011
Do you work there?

676
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,207
Because I thought you were
a fucking general practitioner!

677
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,216
Yes, l...

678
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,741
I do some consulting
there now, but...

679
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:03,515
it's--it isn't
what you think.

680
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:07,115
Oh, my God.

681
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,059
So you knew about Will
this whole time.

682
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:13,655
Lori, listen to me.

683
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:17,896
You're upset.
We both are.

684
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,903
Now I think what you need now...

685
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:23,202
more than anything
is to get some rest.

686
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:24,902
Why don't I give you
some pills...

687
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,603
and that'll help you sleep...

688
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,135
and then we talk
about it in the morning?

689
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,011
I don't want
to sleep, Dad!

690
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:33,142
I want to know why
you've been lying to me!

691
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,242
We'll talk about it
in the morning!

692
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,014
Now do what I say!

693
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:37,487
Lori! Lori!

694
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,290
Open this door.
Open this door!

695
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,727
Go away!

696
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:46,730
Damn it, Lori!

697
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:48,391
Let me in!

698
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,565
Goddamn it!

699
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,454
It's OK, it's me.
It's me, shh! Shh!

700
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,625
You OK? Are you OK?

701
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,794
It's me, all right?

702
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:29,671
I don't know how your father's
connected to all this...

703
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:30,969
but I think
Mark was right.

704
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,841
There's some kind of cover-up
going on here with Krueger.

705
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:38,145
We can't trust the police.

706
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,512
We can't trust
any of the adults.

707
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:45,321
So what do we do?

708
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,119
We gotta get to Mark.

709
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,052
He's the expert in all of this.

710
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,082
He'll know what's going on.

711
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:05,270
You always looked out
for me, bro.

712
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,708
Hey, Mark.

713
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,513
I gotta stay awake.

714
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:04,262
Shit!

715
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:18,210
Hey, Mark.

716
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:19,812
You didn't forget
about me, did you?

717
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:21,220
Oh, God.

718
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:23,282
Oh, that's right!

719
00:50:23,326 --> 00:50:24,657
Everyone forgot!

720
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:27,128
That's why they weren't
afraid anymore!

721
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:28,653
That's why I needed Jason
to kill for me...

722
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:30,791
to get them to remember.

723
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:36,100
But now he just won't stop,
that hockey puck!

724
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:47,271
This isn't...real.

725
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:53,281
Somebody, please, wake me up!

726
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:54,619
Please!

727
00:51:05,468 --> 00:51:08,266
Mark! Mark, wake up!

728
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:11,137
I need you to send
a little message for me.

729
00:51:11,173 --> 00:51:14,506
That's all,
just a little message.

730
00:51:14,543 --> 00:51:16,443
I'm not gonna do it.

731
00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:18,106
I won't do it!

732
00:51:18,147 --> 00:51:20,672
No?!

733
00:51:20,716 --> 00:51:23,617
I won't do it.

734
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:37,864
I'll have to pass that message
myself, won't l?

735
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:44,835
Oh, my God!

736
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:52,313
Let go of me!

737
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:53,906
Help...me.

738
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:55,576
Mark!

739
00:52:06,095 --> 00:52:10,361
Pass on a little
message for me, will ya?

740
00:52:21,844 --> 00:52:24,813
Sheriff,
I've been compiling info...

741
00:52:24,847 --> 00:52:26,781
based on eyewitness reports
of the hockey mask killer.

742
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:28,545
We already know who did this.

743
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,575
Sheriff, we closed
down the school...

744
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,382
and set up a curfew
for anyone under eighteen.

745
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:33,513
Good.

746
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:35,319
Now I want twenty-four-hour
roadblocks set up.

747
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:36,949
Nobody leaves town,
nobody gets in.

748
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:38,516
We're gonna contain
this son of a bitch...

749
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:39,755
before he spreads any further.

750
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:41,990
Yes, sir.

751
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,931
Sir, shouldn't we have
the F.B.I. come in and--

752
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:46,127
No outsiders, Stubbs.

753
00:52:46,168 --> 00:52:48,636
We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.

754
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:50,901
OK, I'm a little lost here.

755
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,339
Stopped who before?

756
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:55,571
We don't say his name out loud.

757
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:57,545
You're not from around here.

758
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,547
I don't expect you
to understand.

759
00:52:58,581 --> 00:53:00,640
With all due resect, Sheriff...

760
00:53:00,683 --> 00:53:03,277
I think we have a copycat
of the old Jason Voorhees...

761
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:04,684
Crystal Lake killer
on our hands--

762
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,017
You listen to me.

763
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:08,489
We do things around here
a certain way for a reason...

764
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:10,890
and that's given us
four years of peace.

765
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,985
So you either do your job
and keep your mouth shut...

766
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:15,223
or, so help me God,
I will lock you up!

767
00:53:15,264 --> 00:53:17,596
Do you understand me?!

768
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:21,796
Yes, sir.

769
00:53:32,515 --> 00:53:34,380
Why don't we all just leave?

770
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:39,149
No, even if we leave,
Freddy can still get us.

771
00:53:39,188 --> 00:53:42,624
We all know about him.
We're all afraid of him.

772
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:49,092
It was our fear that
gave him his power.

773
00:53:49,131 --> 00:53:51,725
We're marked now.

774
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,564
Man, screw that clown.

775
00:53:53,602 --> 00:53:55,069
I mean, what kind
of a pussy...

776
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:56,765
comes after you
in your dreams anyway?

777
00:53:56,806 --> 00:53:59,832
Now, that big-ass mother fucker
back at the cornfield...

778
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,036
all right, that's who
we should be afraid of.

779
00:54:02,077 --> 00:54:04,272
Tell me who
the fuck that was.

780
00:54:04,313 --> 00:54:06,713
His name was Jason Voorhees.

781
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:09,980
Shit, man...um...

782
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:12,954
How'd you know
we were here?

783
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:15,218
Nothing personal,
but the Scooby van out back...

784
00:54:15,257 --> 00:54:17,054
wasn't exactly subtle.

785
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:19,424
And never keep
your keys in the door.

786
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:21,725
Great, so now we're
completely fucked.

787
00:54:21,764 --> 00:54:23,629
No, you're not.

788
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,191
I'm here to help you.

789
00:54:26,235 --> 00:54:29,033
Now, this Jason Voorhees
supposedly drowned...

790
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:31,562
at Camp Crystal Lake
back in 1957...

791
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:33,336
when he was
eleven years old.

792
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,173
The counselors weren't
watching him...

793
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:39,010
then they made the mistake
of killing his mother.

794
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:41,175
The legend has it...

795
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,708
that Jason kept returning
from his grave...

796
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:45,583
to punish whoever
returned to the camp.

797
00:54:45,621 --> 00:54:48,522
I think we're dealing
with a copycat here.

798
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:50,149
No. No. No, no, no.

799
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:51,682
He's not a copycat.

800
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,354
I've seen what he can do.
He's the real Jason.

801
00:54:53,395 --> 00:54:55,693
That's impossible, Linderman.
Jason is dead.

802
00:54:55,731 --> 00:54:58,859
You'd better start thinking
outside your little box, dude...

803
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:00,562
'cause somebody's
definitely breaking...

804
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:02,628
the fucking reality rules, OK?

805
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:04,036
It makes sense in a way.

806
00:55:04,073 --> 00:55:07,600
I mean, what if Freddy
brought Jason back...

807
00:55:07,643 --> 00:55:09,907
because he was too weak
to go after us on his own...

808
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:12,505
so he used Jason.

809
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:14,607
I mean, he knew that
we'd think it was him...

810
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,174
that we'd spread
the fear again.

811
00:55:16,218 --> 00:55:17,412
And now that it's working...

812
00:55:17,453 --> 00:55:20,013
it's like he can't
shut Jason back down.

813
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:21,682
Wait a minute.

814
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:24,750
Freddy died by fire,
Jason by water.

815
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:26,852
How can we use that?

816
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:29,694
I think we should
concentrate on Jason first.

817
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:31,427
But I thought we decided...

818
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:33,162
that Freddy was the one
pulling the strings.

819
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:35,636
Shouldn't we go
after him first?

820
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:38,299
I don't know, maybe
what we need to do is...

821
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,934
to offer Freddy
a sacrifice.

822
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:42,534
Yeah, yeah, totally.

823
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:45,809
Like a virgin, right?
Someone pure.

824
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,620
Dude, don't look at me.

825
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:56,124
Even if you pay for it,
it still counts.

826
00:55:56,158 --> 00:55:58,217
Oh, come on.

827
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,058
Look, we all know who
the real virgin is here.

828
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:03,758
-Kia!
-Oh, come on, Lori.

829
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:05,596
I know you never
made it with Will.

830
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:10,435
Why would he want to when
he can fuck somebody like me?

831
00:56:15,878 --> 00:56:17,470
Let's tie the bitch up.

832
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:22,440
What?

833
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:27,253
Don't worry, angel.

834
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:28,950
You've still got me.

835
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:31,459
Come on, give daddy a kiss.

836
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:39,828
Your eyes say no-no...

837
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:44,305
but my mouth says yes-yes.

838
00:56:48,744 --> 00:56:50,371
Lori, are you all right?

839
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:51,572
You fell asleep.

840
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:01,781
Oh, shit!

841
00:57:05,627 --> 00:57:07,618
I pulled that out of my dream.

842
00:57:07,663 --> 00:57:09,654
How is that possible?

843
00:57:09,698 --> 00:57:11,723
Anything is possible now!

844
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:13,029
God, you just don't get it!

845
00:57:13,068 --> 00:57:15,195
Oh, God, y'all, two killers?

846
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:17,137
We're not safe awake or asleep.

847
00:57:17,172 --> 00:57:19,003
It's not the sleep
that's killing us...

848
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,008
it's our dreams.

849
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:22,704
At Westin, Mark and l
never had dreams.

850
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:25,475
Were you on any drugs?

851
00:57:25,514 --> 00:57:27,914
Yeah, but there's
something called hypnocil.

852
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,009
They never told us
what it was for...

853
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:32,077
but everyone there
was taking it.

854
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:36,817
Experimental drug...

855
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:38,417
not even approved yet
by the F.D.A.

856
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,257
Oh, shit.

857
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:44,197
Used for...
suppression of dreams.

858
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:47,725
We need those pills,
enough for all of us.

859
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,897
Can you get us
back to Westin Hills?

860
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:11,817
All right,
this isn't it, guys.

861
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,691
Come on, let's go.

862
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:14,696
Hey, dude.

863
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,061
Let's take a little
J-break, huh?

864
00:58:16,098 --> 00:58:18,760
No, man. He's a cop.

865
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:21,292
Come on. What's he
gonna do, arrest me?

866
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:23,668
Hold up.
Hang on a second.

867
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:25,070
Fuck.

868
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,880
That's better.

869
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:53,294
Where's Freeburg?

870
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:54,324
Come on. Come on!

871
00:59:12,121 --> 00:59:13,281
This is "D" wing.

872
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:16,018
These are the ones
who wouldn't stop dreaming.

873
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:25,294
Are they dead?

874
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,639
They're in a coma.

875
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:34,471
It says they were given
too much hypnocil.

876
00:59:35,844 --> 00:59:37,709
Who would do this to people?

877
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:40,374
Your dad's name
is at the bottom...

878
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,973
of both of these charts.

879
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:52,458
Cool...yeah.

880
01:00:02,437 --> 01:00:05,065
What the fuck?

881
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:20,253
Nice.

882
01:00:27,963 --> 01:00:29,760
Oh, yeah.

883
01:00:34,203 --> 01:00:35,898
Hold up, man.

884
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:48,940
What?

885
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,117
What do you want?

886
01:00:59,294 --> 01:01:02,923
No, I don't know where
the hypnocil is, OK?

887
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:15,341
I can't pour these
down the drain.

888
01:01:15,377 --> 01:01:16,810
We need this stuff.

889
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:34,994
Freeburg!

890
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:37,966
Freeburg!

891
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,262
What are you doing?

892
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:40,427
We need those drugs!

893
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:42,698
Dude, no! Dude--

894
01:01:49,678 --> 01:01:51,305
Go on! Get out of here!

895
01:01:51,346 --> 01:01:53,007
Go!

896
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:10,130
What was that?

897
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:14,959
Let's go check it out.
Let's go.

898
01:02:16,238 --> 01:02:20,436
Get back! Shit! Hell!

899
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:21,999
Fucker!

900
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:23,443
Help me!

901
01:02:40,529 --> 01:02:41,826
Shit! They're all empty!

902
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:42,830
We gotta keep looking.

903
01:02:42,864 --> 01:02:44,229
Maybe there's some down here.

904
01:02:44,266 --> 01:02:46,257
Damn, it's gotta
be here somewhere.

905
01:02:56,878 --> 01:02:57,970
Freeburg, come on!

906
01:02:58,013 --> 01:02:59,913
Come on! Come on!

907
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:02,178
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

908
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:04,344
Freeburg, time to go.

909
01:03:04,386 --> 01:03:06,684
We gotta go!
Now! come on!

910
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:09,384
Let me handle this, bitch.

911
01:03:09,424 --> 01:03:11,085
What?

912
01:03:12,627 --> 01:03:14,424
Come on, come on!
OK, let's go!

913
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,162
Let's go.

914
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:18,291
No, wait, wait!

915
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,322
Look.

916
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:24,563
Come to Freddy.

917
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:28,574
These are my children, Jason.

918
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:31,468
Go back where you belong!

919
01:03:42,157 --> 01:03:44,352
Fuck you!

920
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:48,062
Linderman...

921
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:53,298
These are my children, Jason.

922
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:55,803
Go back where you belong.

923
01:04:08,116 --> 01:04:11,950
Jason...Jason.

924
01:04:11,987 --> 01:04:15,320
My special, special boy.

925
01:04:19,694 --> 01:04:22,060
I'm disappointed
in you, Jason.

926
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:23,997
You disobeyed me.

927
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:25,727
You were supposed
to come back home...

928
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:27,530
just kill a few of them!

929
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:29,764
But I blame myself.
I should've known...

930
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:31,932
you wouldn't be able
to stop killing!

931
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:37,138
You are like a big, stupid dog
who can't stop eating...

932
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:41,616
even though your master
said you've had enough!

933
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:52,159
Now it's time to put
this bad dog to sleep...

934
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:55,689
for good!

935
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:04,463
Not my arm!

936
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:33,067
Welcome to my nightmare.

937
01:05:53,154 --> 01:05:55,384
Penny for your thoughts, chief!

938
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:59,386
Oh, scary.

939
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:20,509
Tilt.

940
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:46,400
Why won't you die?

941
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,159
Come on. Come on!

942
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,749
So you are afraid of something
after all, huh?

943
01:07:46,034 --> 01:07:48,662
How in the fuck did I let y'all
talk me into this?

944
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:50,796
Why don't we just
try and do it here?

945
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:52,830
Why go all the way
to Crystal Lake?

946
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:54,933
Best-case scenario: Jason wins.

947
01:07:54,976 --> 01:07:57,740
He'll already be home,
back where he belongs.

948
01:07:57,779 --> 01:07:58,973
I mean, why follow us anymore?

949
01:07:59,014 --> 01:08:00,675
And if Freddy wins?

950
01:08:00,715 --> 01:08:03,707
At least Jason
has home-field advantage.

951
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:32,210
Aww...how sweet.

952
01:08:33,348 --> 01:08:35,509
You ugly little shit.

953
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:40,385
Now there's a face...
only a mother could love!

954
01:08:42,724 --> 01:08:43,918
Yeah!

955
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,858
Now we're getting somewhere.

956
01:08:45,894 --> 01:08:48,522
Let's see
what really scares you.

957
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:58,436
And dig a little deeper.

958
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:32,573
I'm dying to see what skeletons
are hidden in your closet.

959
01:09:49,424 --> 01:09:51,722
We're seriously running
out of tranq here, guys.

960
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,991
I got maybe one dose,
plus enough for Lori.

961
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:56,257
Well, we're almost there.

962
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:57,696
Then I better get going.

963
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:58,960
No, no, just...

964
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:05,336
I don't want you to go.

965
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:06,897
I'm coming back.

966
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:09,603
Just give me fifteen minutes,
then wake me up.

967
01:10:09,644 --> 01:10:11,874
I'll bring that bastard
Freddy back through.

968
01:10:11,913 --> 01:10:14,643
Just make sure
Jason's waiting for him.

969
01:10:19,287 --> 01:10:22,415
Now I lay me down to sleep.

970
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:48,278
Freak show! Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

971
01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:49,806
Bull's-eye!

972
01:10:53,922 --> 01:10:55,947
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

973
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,389
Try this on!

974
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:01,687
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

975
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,033
Stupid!

976
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:12,306
Aren't you gonna help the kid?!

977
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,865
Can't you see I'm busy here?

978
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:16,342
You mean you're not coming?

979
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,545
It's not my fault this bitch
is dead on her feet.

980
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:32,951
It's been five minutes.

981
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:35,189
Well, that was the last
of the tranq, OK? We're out.

982
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,164
Calm down, OK?
Just relax!

983
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:52,879
Heeeeelp!

984
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:56,543
Wait! Give me your hand!

985
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:59,348
Give me your hand!

986
01:12:00,855 --> 01:12:01,947
Help!

987
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:04,254
Jason?

988
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,055
Jason Vorhees?

989
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:18,706
Y'all...y'all...

990
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:19,764
Y'all, something's wrong.

991
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,001
It's like he's drowning
or something.

992
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:22,407
Freddy must be killing him.

993
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:23,410
We need him alive!

994
01:12:23,444 --> 01:12:24,536
Dude, what do you
want me to do...

995
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:27,047
Iike, give him
mouth-to-mouth or something?

996
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:36,620
Hell no.
Why are you--

997
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:39,126
No! No, I'm not
gonna do that. No!

998
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,422
Kia, look, I would
do it myself...

999
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:42,156
but I've had asthma
since I was six, OK?

1000
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,663
I don't have the lung power.

1001
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:45,131
No.

1002
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:47,498
Kia, he has asthma!

1003
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:50,060
Ooh! Ooh...

1004
01:12:51,306 --> 01:12:53,001
Look, you can do this, OK?

1005
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:54,167
You can do this.
You just--

1006
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:57,939
Shut up! You're not the one
that has to do this.

1007
01:12:57,979 --> 01:12:58,968
I know, but l--

1008
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:00,378
Shut up!

1009
01:13:03,451 --> 01:13:05,510
Oh, my God.

1010
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:09,923
Ohh, God!

1011
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:16,824
Oh, man.

1012
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:19,856
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1013
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,651
You!

1014
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:01,570
What's wrong, Lori?

1015
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,509
Miss your wake-up call?

1016
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,241
Wake me up!
I got him! I got him!

1017
01:14:13,354 --> 01:14:15,481
No!

1018
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:16,547
Lori, come on! Wake up!

1019
01:14:16,591 --> 01:14:18,252
Lori, wake up, please!

1020
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,691
Look!

1021
01:14:19,727 --> 01:14:21,217
Guys, look.

1022
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,022
We're almost there.

1023
01:14:24,065 --> 01:14:26,863
Help me. Come on.
We gotta get her up.

1024
01:14:28,136 --> 01:14:30,195
Come on. Start running.
Start running.

1025
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:32,138
Wake me up!

1026
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,536
Daddy, don't!

1027
01:15:01,903 --> 01:15:04,428
Daddy!
No, daddy, don't!

1028
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:06,303
Freddy!
It was you!

1029
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:08,433
I've always had a thing...

1030
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:11,274
for the whores
that live in this house.

1031
01:15:21,456 --> 01:15:22,480
Lori, wake up!

1032
01:15:25,426 --> 01:15:26,757
Oh, shit.

1033
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:33,132
It's him. He's here.

1034
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:34,759
Lori, come on!
You gotta wake up!

1035
01:15:39,507 --> 01:15:41,134
Oh, yes.

1036
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:48,182
My God!

1037
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:51,976
Come on, Lori, wake up!

1038
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:53,611
Lori, please. Wake up!

1039
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:55,246
Lori, please.
Lori, please.

1040
01:16:01,696 --> 01:16:02,720
Go! Go, go, go!

1041
01:16:05,766 --> 01:16:07,063
Lori!

1042
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,331
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

1043
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,501
Goddamn it!

1044
01:16:19,547 --> 01:16:22,573
Welcome to my world, bitch.

1045
01:16:24,819 --> 01:16:27,549
I should warn you, princess...

1046
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:30,182
the first time tends
to get a little...

1047
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:33,552
messy.

1048
01:16:50,578 --> 01:16:51,567
Get away from her!

1049
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,052
Linderman.

1050
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:08,423
Oh! Oh, no!

1051
01:17:16,137 --> 01:17:18,799
Die, you little bitch.

1052
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:15,594
Jesus, Linderman.
You--you're really hurt.

1053
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,461
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry about me.

1054
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:18,624
Just a scratch.

1055
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:19,792
Just go get help, OK?

1056
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:21,859
What? You don't think--

1057
01:18:21,902 --> 01:18:23,699
Look, I'm just gonna
rest here a minute.

1058
01:18:23,738 --> 01:18:26,036
-Linderman--
-I'm fine, Kia.

1059
01:18:26,073 --> 01:18:27,335
Really.
Now get out of here.

1060
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:28,899
-Go get help.
-But you--

1061
01:18:28,943 --> 01:18:30,467
Just go.

1062
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:35,037
OK, but I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

1063
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:16,284
Lori!

1064
01:19:16,324 --> 01:19:18,656
Think you're so smart,
huh, bitch?

1065
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:21,492
Freddy!

1066
01:19:31,038 --> 01:19:33,131
How sweet...

1067
01:19:33,174 --> 01:19:35,074
dark meat.

1068
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:37,976
-No! Kia!
-Let's go!

1069
01:19:38,012 --> 01:19:39,479
Nooo!

1070
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:41,845
So you're the one
everyone's afraid of?

1071
01:19:44,118 --> 01:19:46,143
Tell me something.

1072
01:19:46,187 --> 01:19:47,882
What kind of faggot...

1073
01:19:47,922 --> 01:19:50,550
runs around
in a Christmas sweater?

1074
01:19:51,926 --> 01:19:54,258
I mean, come on. Get real.

1075
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:55,956
You're not even scary.

1076
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,759
You're not even scary.

1077
01:19:57,798 --> 01:20:01,632
And let's talk about
the butter knives.

1078
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:03,466
What is with the butter knives?

1079
01:20:03,504 --> 01:20:06,598
You trying to compensate
for something?

1080
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,107
Maybe coming up
a little short there...

1081
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:11,202
between the legs,
Mr. Krueger?

1082
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:12,405
Hmm.

1083
01:20:12,446 --> 01:20:15,973
I mean, you got these
teensy-weensy little things...

1084
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:21,454
and Jason has got this
big ol' thing that's like...

1085
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:31,487
Kia!

1086
01:20:31,532 --> 01:20:33,432
-No! No!
-Come on!

1087
01:20:38,806 --> 01:20:39,795
Come on, Lori.
Let's go.

1088
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,864
We can't help her anymore.

1089
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:42,535
No! I'm staying!

1090
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:45,136
Are you crazy?
You got what you wanted.

1091
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,010
You pulled Freddy out,
and now he's fighting Jason.

1092
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:48,241
Come on!
What more do you want?

1093
01:20:48,282 --> 01:20:50,147
He killed my mother, Will!

1094
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:51,549
It was Freddy.

1095
01:20:51,585 --> 01:20:53,917
My dad covered it up
to protect me.

1096
01:20:53,954 --> 01:20:54,921
He didn't do it.

1097
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:56,479
Look, he has taken
everything from us!

1098
01:20:56,524 --> 01:20:58,856
He has ruined
both of our pasts...

1099
01:20:58,893 --> 01:21:02,260
and I am not leaving
until I see him die!

1100
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:32,822
Man the torpedoes.

1101
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:58,578
Hey, asshole!

1102
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,747
Up here!

1103
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:10,159
Aha!

1104
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:28,613
Yeah.

1105
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:41,124
Ah, give me a break.

1106
01:23:06,854 --> 01:23:08,287
Oh, no.

1107
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:12,281
Ohh, noooo!

1108
01:24:36,377 --> 01:24:38,311
Lori, get the tanks!

1109
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:43,311
Give it up!

1110
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:12,169
Freddy!

1111
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:15,112
Go to hell!

1112
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:06,158
It's OK. It's OK.

1113
01:27:37,558 --> 01:27:39,185
You...

1114
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:13,925
Welcome to my world, bitch!
