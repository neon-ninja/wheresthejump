00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:05,969
APOLLO 18

2
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:11,519
JULY 20, 1969- APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUT
NEIL ARMSTRONG...

3
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,900
...IS THE FIRST MAN TO WALK ON THE MOON

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:18,976
IN 1970 APOLLO MISSIONS 18, 19, 20 WERE
CANCELLED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONCERNS

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,503
7 DECEMBER, 1972- APOLLO 17...

6
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:24,811
...THE FINAL OFFICIAL LUNAR LANDS
ON THE MOON

7
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:30,093
IN 2011, 84 HOURS OF CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE

8
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:33,794
...IS UPLOADED TO WWW.LUNARTRUTH.COM

9
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:39,218
THIS FILM WAS EDITED FROM
THAT FOOTAGE

10
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,399
This's a lot of at stake here,
you know.

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,744
Talking, nation versus nation.

12
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,804
The race's still on.

13
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:01,746
It's a lot to discover up there.

14
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:05,160
I guess the call came in on a Friday.

15
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:07,270
They've never been to a barbecue.
JOHN GREY COMMAND MODULE PILOT

16
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,027
Just few beers you know,
or more than a few.

17
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:14,295
Could Vince's cooking, he
definitely need few.

18
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,377
Nate took the call from Milton.

19
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,325
And Milton said, "Eighteen is back on"

20
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:25,216
But it was classified D.O.D.,
top secret.

21
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,191
Asked him "are you OK with that?

22
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:31,523
And it was like "are you kidding me?"

23
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:34,514
I come from a family military pilots.

24
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:37,939
Duty can sometimes pound on
private life.

25
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,487
Make choices. Keep going forward.

26
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:44,022
NASA already has like 800 pounds rocks.
Nathan Walker; Mission Commander

27
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,731
So why we need more, I don't know,

28
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:48,990
...but, hey, if it means a
trip to the moon.

29
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:52,936
Placing cameras, we have these
Westinghouses all over the place.

30
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:55,491
Well, I think the way it's been
explained is...

31
00:01:55,492 --> 00:02:00,467
...they're using a Saturn 5 to launch
classified D.O.D payload.

32
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:04,083
...which's meant to be very large
very heavy and...

33
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,495
...apparently unmanned.

34
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,459
Apparently.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,603
Placing these high frequency
transmitters because...

36
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:17,914
...really warning anti-missile defense
system of Soviyet Union.

37
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:21,437
These PSD 5 are kind of like
high-tech radar scanners.

38
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,979
They should pick up and track
anything we can't.

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,395
To keep an eye on the Russian's air.

40
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:30,735
It would be nice to tell my wife.
Benjamin Andersen-Lunar Module Pilot

41
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:33,266
Or been by my side whole time
and then.

42
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:37,206
She thinks I'm doing training exercise
with the Japanese space agency.

43
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,816
Brian, my boy, it would be nice to tell
him his father's going to the moon.

44
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:44,900
I'd love brought to him a souvenir.
Maybe, a moonrock.

45
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,519
I don't know, may be one day.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,130
Ben was always the first in his class.
And I was always running at his heels.

47
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,071
I mean, I'm jealous that he will
walk on the moon with Nate...

48
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,295
...while I'm alone in an orbit flight.

49
00:02:57,638 --> 00:03:02,359
My job is essentially to make sure
I'm bringing us home safely.

50
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:05,867
Look, let's face it. These missions
are result-oriented.

51
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:09,450
And we can't afford the failure
you know, can we?

52
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:11,734
Things can go wrong... things to go
wrong happen.

53
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,695
These things you're gonna push
them out of your mind.

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,364
It's just not an option.

55
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:23,924
I'm proud to do for these guys,
and proud to do for my country.

56
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:29,721
Ten, nine, eight...

57
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:33,107
seven, six, five...

58
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:37,877
four, three, two, one.

59
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,873
Apollo 18, it looks good.

60
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,380
Christmas lights.

61
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,749
- Bring the Christmas lights back?
- I don't know. Not me.

62
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,216
- Have you seen anything like that before?
- No, sorry.

63
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,576
It's amazing.

64
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:17,519
The earth in all her glory.

65
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,965
There is a good-looking boy.
You sure he's yours?

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,128
Watch it.

67
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,080
He's a good kid.

68
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:27,394
It has a large space to fill.
Play on Moon Boots.

69
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,799
Nate, you've waited all this time to
put your foot on the moon...

70
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,601
...and you need to be number 13.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,724
How do you feel about that?

72
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,461
Are you gonna be OK
with staying behind John?

73
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,149
Oh, you know, would be nice to have
some alone times here.

74
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,729
It's crowded in here.

75
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:47,444
I keep a light on for you boys.
Don't stay out until late.

76
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:51,932
- In a couple days.
- Roger that.

77
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:54,734
See you in a couple days.

78
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:06,559
Houston, this is Freedom. We're
preparing to unboard the Liberty.Over.

79
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:11,014
OK,18. you can go front
dock in four minutes.

80
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:14,812
John, is the tunnel vented?

81
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,921
Roger that. The tunnel is vented.

82
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:21,637
OK, we are ready. We'll send you
an updated state background on that.

83
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:25,620
Roger Houston. We're coding the data.
The computer is all yours.

84
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,124
I wish you come with us, John.

85
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,409
- Now, you be careful down there.
- Don't worry about it

86
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:39,674
- Got a good visual around here
- OK, 18. You're ready for that.

87
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,904
We go to the moon.

88
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:46,691
1400 feet.
44 down.

89
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:49,544
OK, good. Down to 1000 feet.

90
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:55,878
54 LPD.

91
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:58,642
20 feet down. Repeat, 20 feet down.

92
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:01,522
OK, good.

93
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:05,850
Mission Elapsed Time:
Four days, 6 hours and 33 minutes.

94
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,252
Roger.

95
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,775
Here we are.
Take it down.

96
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:14,166
- Carefull with the line. Over.
- Where?

97
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,513
After that next crater.
4 o'clock.

98
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:19,807
It seems pretty rocky area. Mark it.

99
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,898
430 feet.
Down 15.

100
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:29,089
Houston, we have a program alarm
1201.

101
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,505
- You have go to 1201 Liberty.
- Roger. Go to 1201.

102
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:38,933
Do you want to take about
reversing that approach?

103
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,980
Negative. We miss the window.
The moon isn't...

104
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:46,739
- We're closing now. Three, two, one.
- How does it look?

105
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,127
- We're coming in too fast.
- Try to stabilize.

106
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,757
Negative Houston.
The range is long. We go to manual.

107
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,748
- Contact Light.
- Standby everyone.

108
00:06:58,783 --> 00:06:59,853
Stay. No stay.

109
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:04,035
Stay where you are Liberty.

110
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:10,753
Houston, give that man a cigar.

111
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:14,677
- Looks great.
- Excellent landing.

112
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,598
You talking to me or to Nate?

113
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:21,570
I'm talking you both, kid.

114
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,571
25 December, 1974.

115
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:26,313
EMD... 4 days
nine hours, 23 minutes.

116
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,858
Commander, Nathan Walker.
Ministry of Defense, Mission Report 1A.

117
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:32,820
For day one of our two-day mission...

118
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:34,682
This is Thomas Young of
Apollo Mission Control.

119
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:37,313
- Managed to move our 16 mm cameras.
- Copy.

120
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:43,398
Looks like 5 reels 10,000 feet
Kodachrome.

121
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:47,278
Houston, we're prepared for OA1.

122
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,902
Copy Liberty. You are go for
decompression chamber.

123
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:56,682
But not good boys.
We don't want anyone catching cold.

124
00:07:56,907 --> 00:08:00,380
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

125
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:05,569
I look after him.
Hope that the hose is long enough.

126
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,042
Houston...

127
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:24,703
...we take now the first step
on the South Pole.

128
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:30,710
I had prepared a speech but
I don't have much audiences anyway.

129
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:35,126
Do not worry about it.
You will have opportunity soon.

130
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:39,004
There are rock formations
everywhere.

131
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,121
The sun is low on the horizon.

132
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,556
Maybe.

133
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:49,764
Freedom, do you hear?

134
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,914
Freedom receiving you loud and clear,
Liberty. Over.

135
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,950
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

136
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:06,682
You call that a salute?

137
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:09,990
OK. Let me get a shot of you with
that LEM in the background.

138
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:14,199
It's more like a naval salute.

139
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,317
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got to get this.

140
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:21,764
I promised Lauren and Brian
Christmas to spend with them.

141
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:24,923
This's all going back to the
Department of Defense.

142
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:29,186
We're placing Westinghouse
cams.

143
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,249
WESTINGHOUSE MOTION
DETECTION CAMERA

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,110
Sounds good, Nate.
Standby.

145
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:39,524
Motion cencor is tracking you
perfectly, Nate

146
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:43,242
Captain says that we will
test the audio when you get back.

147
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,928
I'm checking the payload
in the missile unit.

148
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:07,028
What was that?

149
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:18,048
Houston, need check that panel
for anything that interferences.

150
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,655
Roger. You need to walk to procedure
location 1 and initiate the procedure.

151
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,302
Copy. We're on our way.

152
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:28,878
Hey, take a look at that.

153
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,142
Makes you think, doesn't it?

154
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,653
It's dusty.

155
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:38,950
Leave the camera here, so
you get better view Tommy.

156
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:52,370
It's hard to believe that the sun
never shines in some places.

157
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,617
Careful now, fellows.

158
00:10:57,652 --> 00:11:00,783
If you are in any of
those craters, you can call to her

159
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:09,682
- PSD5 in place.
- Copy that.

160
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:12,801
You recorded signal frequency
on the PSD5 in your training?

161
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,893
- It was without that, wasn't it?
- I thought, it was.

162
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,235
I think they have changed it.

163
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,203
That's the coordinates: 4.3 on Z and...

164
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:27,301
Inititating sequence is completed.

165
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:38,192
If we gonna get noise
from the high tech again?

166
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:39,930
Don't worry.

167
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,547
A good geological sample
and what appears to be...

168
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:46,341
...an impact crater.

169
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,622
Samples feel...

170
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:55,826
...strange.

171
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:11,612
Let's get out of here.

172
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,674
EMD...four days,
14 hours and 48 minutes.

173
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,418
Commander Nathan Walker.

174
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,270
D.o.D mission report 3C.

175
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,757
Day 1, DVA 1 complete.

176
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,768
I'm starving.
What's the menu tonight?

177
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:30,155
- Carrots or peas?
- I'll take carrots.

178
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,180
- Get the peas.
- Perfect.

179
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,866
I am many proud of you boys.

180
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,984
- You have good time out there?
- You know we have.

181
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:46,452
There is much noise in this frequency.
See if I can isolate it.

182
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:49,285
Cleared up a little bit.

183
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:52,611
Copy that.

184
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:05,506
<i>Astronaut Brian Anderson,
with his dad, flies through space.</i>

185
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:08,296
<i>- Honey, what are you doing?
- Just playing mom.</i>

186
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:11,185
<i>Don't play with your dad's stuff.</i>

187
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,782
<i>- Is this a recording?
- I'm sorry, Dad. I love you.</i>

188
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:20,441
Beverley is in panic because
hairdresser appointment ran over.

189
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,921
Stan and Gene already over,
nothing is ready, so...

190
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:26,302
I offered to help in cutting
the peppers.

191
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:28,990
Couple minutes later I'm in
the bathroom taking a leak...

192
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,279
...and with all these peppers
in my hands...

193
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,472
Next thing I know, my crotch is
on fire.

194
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:39,813
- So, I'm in the bathroom howling in pain.
- They can not hear you.

195
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:43,024
They all heard me.
Stan's wife is a nurse, so...

196
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,927
she sends me back into the bathroom,
with a cup of milk.

197
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:49,628
Hey, I guess you're about to tell me that
you have your balls in a glass of milk?

198
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:53,057
- Hey, no knock it. It works.
- Jalapeno dick!

199
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,650
I can't believe that you've
never heard that story?

200
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:59,478
- Beverly's back to Miami?
- Yes. I heard that.

201
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:01,946
Hear, you divorced because
you snore, right?

202
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,813
I do not snore.

203
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,477
Every time!

204
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:10,083
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

205
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:12,828
- Bumped your head?
- Again!

206
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:14,123
It's big head.

207
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:17,204
Good night guys.
Great first day.

208
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:23,476
- Good night, JD.
- Never should told you that, litle prick.

209
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,547
- Nate?
- Yeah, I hear it.

210
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:22,776
- What can that be here?
- Give me a second.

211
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:27,625
Should be on the cam.

212
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,129
What is that?

213
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,486
- Hear that?
- Yes.

214
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,380
I don't think it comes from here.

215
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:58,689
It does not sound right.

216
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:03,131
- I can't find down here.
- It's army.

217
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:06,558
You think this interference can
be coming from the PSD5?

218
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:10,970
We don't see any obvious.
We double check with the D.o.D.

219
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:23,337
We'll look into it.
You go get some sleep.

220
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,914
I am up.
Turn off the noise.

221
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,553
Good morning, Liberty. We took care of the
interference a couple hours ago.

222
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:26,319
It should be OK now.
Do you get ready for OA2?

223
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:37,034
EMD... five days, 8 hours and 34 minutes.
And I'm Ben Anderson.

224
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,972
I need to document this.

225
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:45,877
Nate says he never snores in his sleep.

226
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:49,413
I got proof.

227
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:03,679
Hello boys, just to let you know...

228
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:06,139
...Freedom, we're going to around the
corner to the back side.

229
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:09,614
- No communication a while.
- Roger that.

230
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:17,339
- I've made you breakfast.
- What do I got?

231
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,032
- Scrambled eggs.
- Again.

232
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,586
- What do you got?
- A delicious hamsbread.

233
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:28,400
It's all yours.

234
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,985
Just like Mom makes.

235
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:39,919
Hey, did you remove one of my samples?
One of my samples is on the ground.

236
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,034
What does that mean, Ben?

237
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,999
I don't know.
I bagged and tagged everything.

238
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:01,715
Look, let's go back in there
giving a scoop.

239
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:08,763
Oh, damn! This one is contaminated.

240
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:11,887
- I don't understand. How did it get here?
- I don't know.

241
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:14,946
- This's really bad. How did it get here?
- I don't know.

242
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,725
D.o.D's checked around the interference
with the first payload.

243
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,373
So found diagnostics...

244
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:35,096
Houston, do you copy?

245
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,644
- There is no communication.
- Probably get some blokage.

246
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,785
I see some big craters.

247
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:45,168
Five days, ten hours, 40 minutes
since we left off.

248
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,336
I'm commander Nathan Walker.
We are on DVA 2.

249
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,465
Initiating day 2 receiver cell.

250
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,217
Activated PSD5 transmission
signal to go.

251
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:05,958
Houston, do you copy?
This is Liberty. Over.

252
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:09,374
Still down.

253
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:15,049
There's something with that frequency.
Communication can't be down like that.

254
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:18,934
- Not for this like the time.
- Where are you going?

255
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,571
What the hell?

256
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,439
- Nate.
- What is it?

257
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:31,588
- Tracks.
- What?

258
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,722
That's impossible.

259
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,700
These are not ours.

260
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:47,698
EMD... five days, 11 hours, 7 minutes.
Alan P. Anderson.

261
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:58,030
Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?

262
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:05,835
Houston, it's 18.
Do you hear?

263
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,998
John is on the back side.
No communication with him either.

264
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,952
Let's see where they lead.

265
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:18,656
- Impact Crater.
- Feel that?

266
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:22,261
Yeah, temperature's dropped.

267
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:29,614
Look at the footprints.
It makes no sense.

268
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:33,060
Like it runs in circles.

269
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,586
Disoriented.

270
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:43,020
- How should you do that?
- I don't know.

271
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:46,623
They go from this direction.

272
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:52,655
Come over here.

273
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:05,328
Holly shit!

274
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:16,586
- It is Russians.
- What the hell?

275
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:32,763
How can be Russians on the moon
and nobody know about them?

276
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:41,182
We are on the moon
and nobody knows about it.

277
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:45,069
Something is not right.

278
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:51,590
I'll look inside.

279
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,550
The lights are out.

280
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:31,747
Somebody's lost it in here.

281
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:37,045
Everything is crashed.

282
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,162
Their system isn't different
from ours.

283
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:50,737
The power is on.
Oxygen reserve is good.

284
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:54,417
I can't tell whether they
fully operational though.

285
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,878
- Where the hell did they go?
- I don't know.

286
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,572
- I want to take a look around.
- Stay close.

287
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:08,819
Those Russians could be anywhere.

288
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:15,947
What the hell?

289
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:21,142
There is blood. A lot of blood.

290
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,303
Someone's got hurt pretty bad.

291
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:32,562
I don't like this.

292
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:42,642
I think I see something inside the crater.

293
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,737
I'll go down.

294
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,903
Wait, Ben. The suits are no
ready for that kind of cold.

295
00:24:58,884 --> 00:25:02,118
No cape. The crater is so deep.

296
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,143
It's so cold.

297
00:25:08,144 --> 00:25:11,511
I'll see around.

298
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:16,087
The ground is different.

299
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:19,291
It is soft.

300
00:25:20,023 --> 00:25:22,934
Get out of there.

301
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:32,330
Oh, my god!

302
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:36,320
It's so cold.

303
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:41,174
Get out of there.
Ben!

304
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,551
OK, I'm get out of here.

305
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:46,545
Holy shit!

306
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:51,407
It's a dead cosmonaut.

307
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,204
I'm on my way up.

308
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:04,497
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm get to go.

309
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:08,330
What happened here?

310
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,323
- Maybe the other cosmonaut?
- Do you think killed him?

311
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:23,238
- There is a crack.
- What are you doing?

312
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:26,590
Get your head out of there.

313
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,335
Wait. Something..

314
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:33,110
What the hell was that?

315
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:44,083
It's a rock.

316
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,606
Have it in his jacket down here.
I don't know.

317
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:49,984
Let's get out of here.

318
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:56,129
We're on the point of no turning back.
If we don't go now, we're just as dead.

319
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:04,789
- I don't like someone has died up here.
- I know.

320
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:19,591
This is a secure line.
I'm just talking to you, right Tommy?

321
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:22,475
You're just talking to me.

322
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,577
The Russians have been to the moon.

323
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:27,058
Say that again?

324
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,863
The Russians have landed on the South Pool.

325
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:33,375
We've found their LK Proton lander.

326
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,974
It has not ended well for the cosmonauts.

327
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,442
- We find the crash of the Russians?
- They didn't crashed.

328
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:45,991
- We found his body in a crater.
- You found a dead cosmonaut?

329
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:48,445
Somebody didn't know this?

330
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,677
We landed less than 2
clicks of the Soviets, OK?

331
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,220
You still believe they
did not know we were here.

332
00:27:57,665 --> 00:28:00,496
We know they scrapped a manned
flight programme in '69.

333
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:02,293
That was the official word.

334
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:07,170
Did you know they were here?

335
00:28:10,114 --> 00:28:11,759
Tommy?

336
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:13,299
This is a D.o.D mission Nate.

337
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,679
I'm just bringing down what I need
to know. That's all I can tell you.

338
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,430
Say that prick from the D.o.D
to give me a call.

339
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,897
Get some rest. I get the go D.o.D
over here and talk to you soon.

340
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,639
Tommie is straight here.

341
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,107
I knew something's wrong
from the beginning.

342
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,754
OK, what do you think?

343
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,598
D.o.D's taken over.
Lying to our families.

344
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,387
And the Russians up here for what?
To set up some listening devices?

345
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:45,476
I don't know.
That makes no sense.

346
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:49,017
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
That was our president for God's sake.

347
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,528
And you don't think the
D.o.D which is lie to us?

348
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:55,250
So what are we doing up here?

349
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:58,675
What we're really doing?

350
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:05,288
This can be spooky a little.

351
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:10,159
Strange beauty in the backside.

352
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:14,194
I do not know if my mind plays
tricks on me...

353
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:16,649
...but every so often you go
to those little windows...

354
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:19,536
...get this sense as if
something is looking back.

355
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:22,418
Looking back to you.

356
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,302
Nate, look at this.

357
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:19,102
- What?
- Look at this!

358
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,527
The flag is gone.

359
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:28,746
- This isn't right.
- Houston, this is 18. Over.

360
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:31,918
Houston, Liberty.

361
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:35,187
Did you see anything unusual in the
Westinghouse last night?

362
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:40,010
We had some interferences.

363
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,128
Our flag has gone.

364
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:44,616
Repeat again.

365
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,376
Repeat once.

366
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:55,665
Maybe the other cosmonaut
took it.

367
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:57,724
If there is another cosmonaut...

368
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,245
...he would need oxygen for
minimum 10 to 12 hours.

369
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:06,788
- What do you think, John?
- There is no way.

370
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:09,071
He can not carry that much.

371
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:10,803
So, how can he survive?

372
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:13,383
Maybe there is not a 'he'.

373
00:32:13,418 --> 00:32:15,772
You're saying the Soviet flew
one man mission?

374
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:18,807
- It would not be the first time.
- One cosmonaut...

375
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,650
But who took the flag?
Who killed the other cosmonaut we found?

376
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:26,264
Please get the D.o.D online.

377
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:27,737
Now.

378
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:31,329
We suspect that the Soviets are
there, but we have no confirmation.

379
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:32,967
The Intelligence warned that
they might be...

380
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:35,895
...disguising the machines as
routine satellite launches.

381
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:37,794
Why the hell did not you tell us?

382
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:39,419
National security.

383
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:42,251
We carried out the card pretty close
to the desk. No other option.

384
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:43,760
I'm sure you can understand.

385
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,434
Maybe a little too close.

386
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,111
We were concerned that they
might ride to the sky first.

387
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:54,085
That would be a national security disaster.

388
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:55,978
So, where the hell is
the other cosmonaut?

389
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:58,627
They're just gonna leave
him here?

390
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:03,142
Our intelligence suggests
there was only one cosmanaut.

391
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:03,758
Oh, God!

392
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,402
The mission is complete.
Time to get you boys home again.

393
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:10,500
So, that's it?

394
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:16,590
First we return home
and ask questions later.

395
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,787
- What was that?
- Let's get out of here.

396
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:37,223
It looks pretty good.

397
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,640
Ten seconds.

398
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,610
Ten seconds.
Wait for my mark.

399
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:43,276
- Eight...
- Time to go home.

400
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:44,609
Seven, six...

401
00:33:57,434 --> 00:34:00,760
- That's the alarm.
- We can't go. No go. We are no go.

402
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,448
Save this damn thing.

403
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:04,152
I try.
I got a power glitch.

404
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:05,777
Use the spare oxygen.

405
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:07,695
- We have a leak somewhere.
- I try to isolate the tanks.

406
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,493
See if I can stop it.

407
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:10,331
Houston, do you copy?

408
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:13,508
Houston, do you copy?
We lost communication.

409
00:34:13,864 --> 00:34:16,041
Dropped out. Closed.

410
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:18,731
- No, no.
- What the hell is going on?

411
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,400
Houston, this is Liberty. Over.

412
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:43,199
We just lost communication.

413
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:49,573
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.

414
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:52,295
Maybe hit the LEM,
or a meteor rain.

415
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:55,133
There's no way no tell.
I'm gonna to the air.

416
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,474
Are you sure about this?

417
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:00,513
We need communication
to get home.

418
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,516
You just stay here and wait.

419
00:35:03,747 --> 00:35:06,050
- Look, I served in the army...
- Shut up.

420
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,885
Go down the platform.

421
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,724
Nothing on the bottom.

422
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:16,420
EMD...Six days.

423
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:20,091
13 hours, 46 minutes.

424
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:24,336
Commander Walker is performing
an unplanned DVA...

425
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,868
...to repair the antenna on the Roover.

426
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:32,726
We experience...we experience
some unexplained...

427
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:35,357
...malfunctions.

428
00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:42,721
The whole installation seems damaged.

429
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:47,798
Could be the brief impact
but I don't see any meteor residue.

430
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:57,204
- This reaped to pieces.
- Something crashed it?

431
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,190
I can't tell.

432
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,826
We get the same sound each time
we activated the communication..

433
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:05,302
- Go to a different frequency.
- Frequency is blocked.

434
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:07,427
I never heard anything like it.

435
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:09,594
Wait. Wait.

436
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:18,424
Nate, talk to me. What do you see?

437
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:20,529
Footprint tracks.

438
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:24,154
Footprints?
Maybe there is another cosmonaut.

439
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,558
No.

440
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:31,062
Mission Duration:
Six days, 13 hours, 47 minutes.

441
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,174
Commander Nathan Walker.

442
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:38,590
We witness tracks that could be
evidence of extraterrestial contact.

443
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,636
We witness tracks that could be
evidence of extraterrestial contact.

444
00:36:44,897 --> 00:36:47,177
Do you know what you're saying?

445
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:50,544
These tracks are not human.

446
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:55,608
I found the flag.

447
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,212
It's shreded.

448
00:36:58,213 --> 00:37:00,964
And the motion censor camera gone.

449
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:05,830
That looks OK.

450
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,323
I'm turning the Roover back up.

451
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:24,944
The connection looks good.

452
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:29,271
Try contact to Houston or Freedom.

453
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,354
Freedom, copy?

454
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,426
Houston, do you copy?

455
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:39,940
Dammit.

456
00:37:40,463 --> 00:37:43,110
- No, looks not working.
- OK. Let me try something.

457
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:57,275
Wait.

458
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,536
- Something is moving.
- What?

459
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:06,880
- I don't see anything
- There's something in my boots.

460
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,635
It's in my helmet.

461
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:15,576
- OK, listen to me. Go back to the lab.
- I can't get it out!

462
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:18,159
- Listen.Go back to the lab. OK?
- I can't get it out.

463
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,742
There is nothing inside your suit.
Go back to the ship.

464
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:21,963
It's in my helmet.

465
00:38:21,964 --> 00:38:24,034
Don't take it out!

466
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:27,425
Nate!

467
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,397
Jesus Christ!

468
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:45,592
Nate!
Nate!

469
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,591
Nate!

470
00:38:56,592 --> 00:38:57,907
You need oxygen.

471
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:04,930
Come on Nate! Keep moving.

472
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:08,095
We're almost there.

473
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,213
Keep moving.

474
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:15,047
Almost there. Come on.
Come on. Almost there.

475
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,225
Pull yourself up.

476
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:36,582
The door is closed.

477
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:42,962
Cabin press auto,
4.5 psi.

478
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,083
You don't get enough oxygen.

479
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,748
Breathe! Breathe!

480
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:00,750
One.

481
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:05,055
Look at me in the eye.
You'll be fine.

482
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,469
Two.

483
00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:14,334
Two and a half.

484
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:19,803
The cabin pressure is stable.
It's okay.

485
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,661
So, you OK?

486
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,520
I'm fine.

487
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:34,735
What happened out there?

488
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,312
You've started screaming, I've come out
there and you're on your back.

489
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:53,290
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?Over.

490
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:58,339
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

491
00:41:03,947 --> 00:41:06,424
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you hear me?

492
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,123
We hear you, John. Over.

493
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:09,664
I can't receive the Liberty, Tommy.

494
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:12,792
Copy that Freedom.
We have the same problem down here.

495
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:14,780
Have you tried to change the frequency?

496
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:20,234
No. We had some sort of interference.
Could have something to do with those PSD5.

497
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:24,619
We are not sure yet that PDS5
are the source of the problem.

498
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,682
I want to switch shut down the
receivers to see what happened.

499
00:41:28,683 --> 00:41:30,931
Negative.

500
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:34,136
Why not? We got two men
down there Tommy. Come on.

501
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,008
Tommy?

502
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:39,474
Are you there?

503
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,987
We are working on the problem.
We'll keep you adviced.

504
00:41:43,307 --> 00:41:46,373
Oh, you're working on it.
That's great.

505
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:49,314
God damn it.

506
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:54,436
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

507
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:01,372
EMD...
Six days, 16 hours, 12 minutes.

508
00:42:01,373 --> 00:42:04,825
Post DVA 1,5 hours
with Commander Walker

509
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:07,089
I've already told everything
I remember.

510
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,391
Come on.

511
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,574
Are you paranoid, Ben?

512
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:14,852
I thought I saw something...

513
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:20,991
I thought I saw something on
the corner of my eye. I was wrong...

514
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:23,853
...and then there was a shrieking voice...

515
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:26,359
...and caught off guard.

516
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:28,170
I must have hit a rock.

517
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,388
That's it.

518
00:42:32,894 --> 00:42:35,231
You said something was in your
helmet.

519
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:37,037
You yelled.

520
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,055
I don't remember that.

521
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,002
Christ! You're bleeding.

522
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:56,037
Look at your shirt.
You bleed.

523
00:42:56,939 --> 00:43:00,523
Jeez.
Take the first aid kit.

524
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:10,982
You said that something was
inside your suit.

525
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,831
That's what you said.

526
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:20,000
You said inside your helmet.

527
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,756
I wonder
how did you get that wound.

528
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:32,771
If there is something in your suit,
where the hell did it go?

529
00:43:33,757 --> 00:43:35,573
Wait a second.

530
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:40,365
Nate, I can feel it
right here.

531
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,711
Oh, man! Something's inside.

532
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:46,401
- What are you talking about?
- Look, it's just below the skin.

533
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:54,907
I need to get that out. OK?

534
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:59,151
Yeah. OK.
Just make it quick.

535
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,016
Everything is right.

536
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:19,249
Hang in there!

537
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,978
Damn, it seems to be moving.

538
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:27,599
Get it out.

539
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,454
- I got it! I got it!
- Get it out!

540
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:32,507
Jesus!

541
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:37,811
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.

542
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:43,163
Put this on it.

543
00:44:46,488 --> 00:44:49,021
It looks like one of my samples.

544
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:58,034
You said you felt something's
moving in your helmet.

545
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:03,354
I don't understand,
how did this get in...

546
00:45:04,554 --> 00:45:08,275
Goddamn, you contaminated the entire ship.

547
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:15,817
Liberty, do you copy?

548
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,129
Houston, we hear you.

549
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:24,605
Liberty, do you copy?

550
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,668
Dammit Houston, we hear you.

551
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:30,260
Liberty, do you receive?

552
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,492
They can't hear us.

553
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:37,666
Liberty, do you hear?

554
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:56,387
Those PSD5's...

555
00:45:58,472 --> 00:46:00,886
...what if they're not there
to spy on the Russians?

556
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,448
What do you mean?

557
00:46:05,234 --> 00:46:08,245
They told us that the transmitters...

558
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:11,722
...pick up any frequency,
but they don't.

559
00:46:11,755 --> 00:46:14,958
They're blocking our communication,
transmitting a signal.

560
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:25,802
Alright.

561
00:46:26,654 --> 00:46:28,592
And why would they do that?

562
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:30,448
No, keep filming. Keep filming.

563
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,193
We need to document this.

564
00:46:34,512 --> 00:46:38,352
To attract the Soviets, made the tracks is

565
00:46:41,734 --> 00:46:43,928
...whatever killed the cosmonaut.

566
00:46:47,085 --> 00:46:49,598
All these cameras, man...

567
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,594
...they're watching us.

568
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:57,986
We are alone.

569
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:01,890
We are guinea pigs.

570
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,950
That's why they sent us here.

571
00:47:06,328 --> 00:47:08,635
We have to turn off those
transmitters.

572
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,418
PSD5's destroyed.

573
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:17,873
Brilliant.

574
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:25,294
Nice tracks.

575
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:31,867
They were here.

576
00:47:37,682 --> 00:47:39,542
Let's check on the other sides.

577
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:45,688
Liberty, do you copy?

578
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:49,800
Liberty, do you copy?

579
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:53,534
Liberty, do you copy?

580
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:03,564
Something's down here.

581
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:12,878
It's gone.

582
00:48:14,886 --> 00:48:16,859
Hey, what are you looking at?

583
00:48:19,434 --> 00:48:20,998
This was a bad idea.

584
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:24,551
You need to get rest, Nate. OK?
We're get to back to lab.

585
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:27,449
We need to get back, Nate.

586
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:37,729
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.

587
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:41,616
It's in your blood stream.

588
00:48:43,857 --> 00:48:45,993
The previous wound seems to...

589
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,042
...become infected.

590
00:48:49,973 --> 00:48:52,560
Eyes are extremely bloodshot.

591
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:00,658
I do not know how to treat it.

592
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:07,343
Houston, this is Freedom.

593
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:10,095
I haven't be able to reach Nate or Ben.

594
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:11,672
Communication's still down with Liberty.

595
00:49:11,673 --> 00:49:13,555
We have no communication
with the crew...

596
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:15,959
...we're receiving data from the LEM.

597
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,038
We're trying to restore the
communication now. Standby.

598
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,806
Liberty, this is Houston.

599
00:49:22,189 --> 00:49:25,154
Looks like you can hear us,
but we can't hear you.

600
00:49:25,156 --> 00:49:29,731
Block the Westinghouse
and survival craft's getting land down.

601
00:49:29,935 --> 00:49:32,772
We estimate 12 hours left
on your live support...

602
00:49:32,773 --> 00:49:34,936
...and we are now sorting out the
engine problems.

603
00:49:34,937 --> 00:49:37,767
We'll do everything we can
to get you home.

604
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:40,832
... and we are now sorting out the
engine problems.

605
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:42,297
We'll do everything we can
to get you home.

606
00:49:42,906 --> 00:49:44,982
They're lying.

607
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,802
No, they'll get us back.

608
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:57,902
Thay'll get us back.
They want that footage.

609
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:04,577
- What about the Russian ship?
- The poor Russian bastard.

610
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:09,187
It looks infected.

611
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:11,117
Just like me.

612
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:13,649
I'm getting worse.

613
00:50:13,703 --> 00:50:16,872
Ben...

614
00:50:16,907 --> 00:50:20,364
- ...you must leave me here.
- No.

615
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,374
- No one leaves anyone.
- You have to.

616
00:50:30,014 --> 00:50:31,942
Forget it. We won't die uphere.

617
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:36,845
Fate has renamed.

618
00:50:37,629 --> 00:50:41,539
The men who went to the moon
to export peace...

619
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,009
...remained on the moon
to rest in peace.

620
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,210
What the hell are you talking about?

621
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:51,820
I feel my toughts...fragmenting.

622
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:01,028
I can be attracted to them.

623
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,926
I'm so tired.

624
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:15,459
EMD
Six days, 22 hours, 23 minutes.

625
00:51:16,084 --> 00:51:18,535
Alan B. Anderson. Doctorial

626
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,281
There were no further
communication with Houston.

627
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:24,635
Oxygen levels are low.

628
00:51:27,415 --> 00:51:30,812
Nate's being sleep for about an hour.

629
00:51:32,017 --> 00:51:36,392
The sickness seems brougth fatigue.

630
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:42,032
We're not gonna make it here.

631
00:51:43,944 --> 00:51:47,170
If Houston doesn't come up with the
plans in the next couple hours, we'll..

632
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:54,517
...we'll abandon Liberty and
go to the Russian LK.

633
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:57,416
Their communications and oxygen
are our only hope.

634
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:03,603
Just pray to God.

635
00:52:15,117 --> 00:52:17,241
Jesus Christ!

636
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:30,704
Jesus!

637
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,876
Partial respiration.

638
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:36,894
Upper left rib...

639
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:40,594
The infection's spreading.

640
00:52:41,968 --> 00:52:43,525
God damn it.

641
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,656
Must be the same thing that
happened to the Russian.

642
00:52:49,451 --> 00:52:53,261
- Nate!
- I don't let you kill me!

643
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:55,550
It's me. Listen to me. Look at me.
It's me. Ok?

644
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,687
I'm just trying to help you.
You're getting worse.

645
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,705
Don't ever touch me!

646
00:54:40,942 --> 00:54:44,131
- Nate, please, what the hell are you doing?
- They are everywhere.

647
00:54:44,132 --> 00:54:47,765
- Please, Nate, you'll kill us all!
- Stop watch us!

648
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,801
Nate!

649
00:54:50,897 --> 00:54:52,997
You're not gonna watch
how I die!

650
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:58,033
What are you doing? Stop!

651
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,162
Stop!

652
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:02,349
Come on! You...

653
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:06,720
Stop there!

654
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,103
Stop that!

655
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:32,102
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?

656
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:38,267
Liberty, this is Freedom.

657
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:43,905
I don't know if you hear me, but
I'm gonna be in the comm range soon.

658
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:47,749
Guys, we need to get you
out of there. There is...

659
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,997
Do you copy?

660
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,989
Come on, guys,
Don't make me leave you here.

661
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:01,672
Freedom, you read us?

662
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:06,924
John...John, can you hear me?

663
00:56:07,181 --> 00:56:09,582
Please, anyone...
can you hear me?

664
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,727
We are leaving Liberty.

665
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,347
- Come on.
- I had to do it.

666
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:34,152
Take the camera.

667
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:36,926
We have 25% of the tank.

668
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,097
We can use some reserv.

669
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:40,997
We'll get there.

670
00:56:41,032 --> 00:56:42,897
I get to get the films.

671
00:56:45,832 --> 00:56:48,453
Black box of the D.o.D

672
00:56:51,058 --> 00:56:53,566
I get to go down.
It's clear.

673
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:10,715
Come Nate, we go.

674
00:57:16,647 --> 00:57:20,227
They are everywhere.
You can't help me.

675
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,186
You don't have to be here.

676
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:31,534
That's OK.

677
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:36,731
- It's gonna be OK.
- Alright. We're gonna make it.

678
00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:45,386
They're waiting for me.

679
00:57:46,645 --> 00:57:48,222
We are not safe here.

680
00:57:53,273 --> 00:57:55,839
- Get rid of me.
- Hang in.

681
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,742
What the hell are you doing?
Hang on!

682
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:26,484
Nate!

683
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:31,170
Nate!

684
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,789
EMD
I don't know...

685
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,971
Roover has been destroyed.

686
00:58:40,544 --> 00:58:42,982
There is no sign of Commander Walker.

687
00:58:57,243 --> 00:59:01,204
American astronaut,
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.

688
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:10,199
Oxygen is getting low.

689
00:59:17,493 --> 00:59:19,959
I'm...

690
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,631
I'm gonna search for the Russian later.

691
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:26,670
Hey, Commander Walker.

692
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,042
Nate!

693
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:47,040
Go away from here, Ben.
This is where they're coming from.

694
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,649
There's nothing here, OK?
You get to come with me.

695
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,013
God damn it! We need get moving.

696
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:55,270
Ben, listen to me.

697
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:58,034
We're running out of time here,
please.

698
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:02,630
You must find the LK? Their system is
identical with ours. Save yourself.

699
01:00:03,695 --> 01:00:06,087
No, Nate! I'm not going.
You're coming with me.

700
01:00:06,088 --> 01:00:08,909
You have to leave me here.
Just get the John.

701
01:00:08,944 --> 01:00:11,731
- I'm not leaving here!
- You can't help me.

702
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,019
But you can save yourself...

703
01:00:13,293 --> 01:00:14,808
Nate!

704
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:16,436
Nate!

705
01:00:17,122 --> 01:00:18,742
Can you hear me?

706
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:21,576
Nate!

707
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:22,808
Answer me!

708
01:00:24,772 --> 01:00:27,654
Do you hear me?
Say something Nate.

709
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,489
Nate, where are you?

710
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:06,729
No! No!

711
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:10,063
My god. No!

712
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:25,455
John, Nate is gone.
Repeat, Nate is gone.

713
01:01:27,304 --> 01:01:29,379
Please, can somebody hear me?

714
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,342
Oh, my God!

715
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,374
Nate!

716
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:18,922
Come on!

717
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,950
Frequency is completed.

718
01:02:45,445 --> 01:02:47,839
This is an American astronaut.

719
01:02:47,873 --> 01:02:50,505
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.

720
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,012
Been copy?

721
01:02:54,075 --> 01:02:57,272
This is Apollo 18. Do you copy?

722
01:03:03,137 --> 01:03:05,120
Anyone, do you copy?

723
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:09,436
Anyone, please. Do you copy?

724
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:14,574
Anything, anybody, do you copy?

725
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,850
Damn!

726
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,995
Confirming Commander Walker.

727
01:03:31,996 --> 01:03:34,562
- Acknowledge.
- This is Captain Ben Anderson...

728
01:03:34,563 --> 01:03:36,643
Do you copy?

729
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:41,995
This is Ben Anderson.
Copy, anybody?

730
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,319
Anybody, please! Do you read me?

731
01:03:49,098 --> 01:03:52,499
Captain Anderson, this is the
Deputy Secretary of Defense.

732
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,946
What?

733
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:56,063
D.o.D? Yes.

734
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:58,487
Yes, this is Captain Ben Anderson.

735
01:03:59,027 --> 01:04:02,920
We communicate with the Russians
and they're putting me through you.

736
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:06,045
We're aware of your condition that...

737
01:04:06,354 --> 01:04:09,045
...and we have decided.

738
01:04:09,828 --> 01:04:13,180
- ...we can't you home.
- No. No, no!

739
01:04:13,181 --> 01:04:15,395
Listen to me please.

740
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:17,899
Nate get a cut on his body. He's infected.

741
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:20,189
There's nothing on me. Please,
have to come and get me.

742
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:25,627
We can't get you.
We can't get you.

743
01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:29,636
Please...

744
01:04:29,637 --> 01:04:34,167
Listen, I...I...got a family
and I need my family.

745
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:40,103
We'll let your family know
you died a hero.

746
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:42,174
I'm sorry Captain.

747
01:04:46,263 --> 01:04:49,764
You have to get me out of here!
And you fucking do it right now!

748
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:53,056
I will not give up
until you get me home!

749
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:03,435
Houston, please.

750
01:05:04,339 --> 01:05:08,302
We'll stay in on this channel with you
but the decision is final.

751
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:12,859
You've done a great service for
your country, son.

752
01:05:27,755 --> 01:05:30,171
EMD...

753
01:05:31,184 --> 01:05:33,351
Still no communication.

754
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:40,365
Astronaut Brian Anderson, with his dad,
flies through the space.

755
01:05:41,531 --> 01:05:44,656
- Brian, what are you doing?
- Just playing, mom.

756
01:05:44,657 --> 01:05:46,811
Do not play with the your dad's stuff.

757
01:05:46,812 --> 01:05:50,692
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.

758
01:05:53,546 --> 01:05:58,124
- Is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad, I love you.

759
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,215
...love you.

760
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:03,756
...Dad, I love you.

761
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:05,785
...love you.

762
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,907
This is Freedom,
are you hearing me?

763
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:29,816
- This is Freedom...
- John, it's Ben. I hear you.

764
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:31,885
Ben, is that you?
Do you copy?

765
01:06:31,886 --> 01:06:34,748
Yes, John, I am.
I hear you.

766
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:39,667
I got you on the VHF, partner.
Where the hell are you?

767
01:06:40,137 --> 01:06:43,964
- Soviet's LK.
- Yes. Good for you.

768
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:46,732
They left me, John.
Left me here!

769
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,560
Where is Nate? How's he?

770
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,886
Get sick, he did not make it.

771
01:06:54,817 --> 01:06:56,935
There's something down here, John.

772
01:06:57,786 --> 01:07:01,790
And they knew about it. You hear me?
Those bastards knew about it!

773
01:07:02,745 --> 01:07:05,175
Forget about the D.o.D, man.

774
01:07:05,592 --> 01:07:07,465
Ben, I'm get you out of there, OK?

775
01:07:07,466 --> 01:07:10,369
Did you figure out that thing?

776
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:13,005
I don't have much choice. Do we?

777
01:07:16,826 --> 01:07:18,421
Powers look good.

778
01:07:18,422 --> 01:07:20,506
And there is plenty fuel.

779
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:22,650
Okay, buddy. You're gonna be
in the darkness yet...

780
01:07:22,684 --> 01:07:25,207
...you're gonna need to get your
synchronized orbit...

781
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:27,845
...then you need a little space for.

782
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:31,079
Safely on board.
How does that sound?

783
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:33,027
Sounds beautiful Johnny.

784
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:36,628
Sound very beautiful.

785
01:07:39,468 --> 01:07:42,465
I don't mean rush you partner
but we're running out of time.

786
01:07:42,561 --> 01:07:44,313
Get that thing in the orbit.

787
01:07:44,348 --> 01:07:46,926
We can run into it.

788
01:07:48,877 --> 01:07:51,554
I got it! I got it, John.

789
01:07:51,555 --> 01:07:53,857
Seven. Six.

790
01:07:54,386 --> 01:07:55,851
Five.

791
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:59,473
- Holy shit!
- Open this door.

792
01:07:59,474 --> 01:08:02,292
Nate, you know I can't do that.
Please, you'll kill us both!

793
01:08:02,293 --> 01:08:04,227
I can't let you in.

794
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:06,648
- I'm coming there.
- No, no!

795
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,391
Nate, please!

796
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:11,307
- Nate, stop this Nate!
- What'd you mean? - It's Nate!

797
01:08:15,406 --> 01:08:17,481
- What is happening?
- Come on buddy! Stop!

798
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,028
Stop!

799
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,517
- What's going on?
- Don't do this! -What do you think?

800
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,587
Jesus Christ! No!

801
01:08:28,596 --> 01:08:32,534
Nate!
Nate!

802
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:36,156
Oh, my God!
Nate!

803
01:08:37,409 --> 01:08:39,119
No!

804
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,213
No, no, no!

805
01:08:42,613 --> 01:08:44,839
You can launch.
You must do it now.

806
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,332
Our window is almost gone.
You have to launch.

807
01:08:47,869 --> 01:08:50,361
Dammit, they were kind of
too close.

808
01:08:50,362 --> 01:08:52,976
We're going home!

809
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:58,747
Ben, listen to me now.

810
01:08:58,748 --> 01:09:00,627
We're going to go home.

811
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:03,488
Heard that? We're going to go home.

812
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:08,533
I'm going home.

813
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,889
We lifted up!

814
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,850
Freedom, do you read?

815
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:22,031
This is the Deputy Secretary of Defense.

816
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:25,082
Ben has been contaminated.
Do not try to rescue him.

817
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,515
I repeat. You will not recover him.

818
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,746
Contaminated by what?
D.o.D?

819
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:35,686
- What do you say? Where is Tommy?
- You will not recover Anderson.

820
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:37,166
This a direct order.

821
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:43,645
I'm on my way.

822
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:52,137
John, you're abording the rescue
immediately.

823
01:09:52,172 --> 01:09:55,772
Captain Anderson has been
contaminated.

824
01:09:55,773 --> 01:09:58,826
You knew something was down there
and you sent them anyway!

825
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:00,958
I'm coming home.

826
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:04,906
I'm coming home.

827
01:10:05,374 --> 01:10:07,041
D.o.D to Freedom

828
01:10:07,076 --> 01:10:09,441
If you're not abording in 60 seconds...

829
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:11,975
...transmittion will be terminated.

830
01:10:12,072 --> 01:10:14,478
You'll not receive updated statement.

831
01:10:14,513 --> 01:10:17,834
You'll run out of life support craft
and you'll not return home.

832
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:23,425
You have 45 seconds
to abort the rescue.

833
01:10:24,526 --> 01:10:28,336
John, we have no choice.
We're begging you. Do not rescue!

834
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:29,949
God damn it, Ben!

835
01:10:31,796 --> 01:10:33,854
We're going home.

836
01:10:38,951 --> 01:10:41,836
I'm in the orbit.

837
01:10:56,123 --> 01:10:58,235
Ben!

838
01:10:59,826 --> 01:11:02,208
They tricked me.
John, get out of here.

839
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,817
Ben, you're coming in too fast!

840
01:11:08,249 --> 01:11:10,331
Ben, your impact, slow it down!

841
01:11:13,424 --> 01:11:16,064
Ben!

842
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:17,885
Ben!

843
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:21,343
Ben!

844
01:11:33,232 --> 01:11:37,778
According to all official reports
Apollo 17 was the final mission.

845
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,471
Official Report
LI. Colonel John Grey...

846
01:11:47,506 --> 01:11:50,393
...was kiiled in a crash during a
training mission over Tallahassee. FL.

847
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:53,955
His body was never recovered.

848
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,624
Official Report
Cmdr. Nathan Walker's F-14 crashed into...

849
01:12:01,659 --> 01:12:04,191
...the Pacific Ocean near Kadena Air
Force Base.

850
01:12:04,224 --> 01:12:06,437
His body was never recovered.

851
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:18,448
Official Report
Cpt. Benjamin Anderson was killed...

852
01:12:18,483 --> 01:12:21,262
...was killed during a mid-air evacuation
over the East China Sea.

853
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:24,365
His body was never recovered.

854
01:12:24,366 --> 01:12:28,788
We chose to go to the moon
in this decade and do the other things.

855
01:12:28,789 --> 01:12:32,477
Not because they are easy,
but because they're hard.

856
01:12:32,478 --> 01:12:38,063
Apollo Missions brought 378 kg Moon Rock
Samples To Earth.

857
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:42,398
Hundreds Were Given Away To
Dignitaries of Foreign Countries

858
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:47,153
Many of These "Gifts" Were Stolen
or Are Now Missing

859
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:53,039
The voyages of Apollo
dramatized the risks.

860
01:12:53,052 --> 01:12:57,200
The men of Apollo identify
the character...

861
01:12:57,235 --> 01:13:01,804
...that accept the danger
and surmounted.

862
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:07,154
There is the spirit that
built America.
