The police is still looking

after twenty-one years
College student Heather Price.

3
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,577
She has been missing for three days,

4
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,580
after last
a friend had visited in "Mills Falls"

5
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,708
At the time of her disappearance
she wore a striped sweater,

6
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,873
a dark blue jeans and sneakers,
The police are looking for anyone who notes

00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:45,670

Photo will be uploaded

9
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,906
The time has come.

10
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,197
Kill Kristy,

11
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:19,291
Kristy: Female first name
Latin origin.

12
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,910
Kristy means follower of Christ.

13
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,751
Kill Kristy, then you kill God.

14
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:35,054
Kristy is pretty,
innocent and sheltered

15
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,765
Find them,

16
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,196
Follow her,

17
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,819
Recognize your fear,

18
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,540
mobile phone jammer

19
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,886
Photo will be uploaded

20
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,019
Let all partake of your work

21
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,269
Together we are strong.

22
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,944
They are weak.

23
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,585
You are Kristy.

24
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,870
To see the world in a grain of sand
and heaven in a wild flower,

25
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:11,441
hall infinity in your hand
and the hour is for eternity.

26
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:15,486
A robin in a cage
calls the wrath of heaven ...

27
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,157
Can not you even be serious?

28
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,618
I have to laugh.
because you sound so bored.

29
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,033
No, I think it's not boring.
I just do not know how to unravel it.

30
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,753
This is poetry, you nerd
No dry physics.

31
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:30,122
Did you just "nerd"
said to me? - Yes.

32
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,006
This is not an equation
or a formula, but interpretation.

33
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,255
As for poetry,
can hold a candle Hardly Blake.

34
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,973
Therefore, the best way is perhaps
mentally to slip into his skin.

35
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,393
Not in all of us
slumbers a writer

36
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,974
A dormant writer

37
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,604
Sounds interesting. - Okay,
a two in the course can I forget.

38
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,230
I focus
on the other subjects,

39
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:58,074
I save at least my
Scholarship. - I'll help you.

40
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,945
You wanted to start driving time
remember?

41
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,163
Sulking because someone?
You did not come.

42
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,701
Everything good, Aaron. You got me
? achgelegt, now you can go.

43
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:08,834
Take with Nicole, if you want

44
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,294
Is it idiotic,
Thanksgiving hang out here alone?

45
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,926
A long weekend, two girls
innocent and alone, you can find idiotic?

46
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:19,171
Actually, this sounds hot. - That's right!
Too bad that you can not be there.

47
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:20,763
Down there! - Just you wait. you!

48
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,487
Heisenberg dealt with the limits
the Predictable. When light for example.

49
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:43,862
We know exactly what happened,
when sodium nitrate meets water. Boom!

50
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:46,832
But no, the turbulence
Qualms of the previously calculated.

51
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,380
I know, Mom., We have already
discussed. The flights are really expensive.

52
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:00,424
Every time for the holidays
explode prices.

53
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,676
No, I just said, explode prices
Yes, I'll see you at Christmas.

54
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,426
And you've got to happiness
Tammy and the baby.

55
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,020
Should I leave the lights on, Justine?

56
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,776
No, you can make it quiet
I'm also almost finished.

57
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:16,234
Come on, come with me.
I swear to you, she lets you in peace

58
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,863
I will never forget the 4th of July
where they asked me

59
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:21,031
as for my career
as a dishwasher so runs.

60
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,036
Since she has misunderstood what.
- But she already understands that some people

61
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,871
for their livelihood
have to work. - Now is time well.

62
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,493
My goodness,
sometimes you're something of stubborn.

63
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:32,081
What should I do
so are you satisfied?

64
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,967
I want you to stay here.
With me. Just this once.

65
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,055
You know my family
I must go there.

66
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,059
Einstein's universe
is a universe of order,

67
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:54,100
in principle, everything is predictable
Whereas Heisenberg theorized,

68
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,194
the world is chaotic by nature
and ultimately not predictable.

69
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,401
Your missing me terribly.

70
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,070
Hey, Justine!

71
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,695
That was Scott the caretaker

72
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,704
You're also soon end, yes?

73
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,630
So then I wish you a nice
Thanksgiving. - I wish you well, Greg.

74
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:23,967
A famous quote that Einstein at least
is attributed, is: God does not play dice.

75
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,557
In contrast, according to Heisenberg's approach
dices God continually,

76
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,728
Say it. - What can I say?

77
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,389
You know.

78
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,608
Your high-tech weapons
not work for me unfortunately.

79
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,697
Say it. - Come on, Aaron.

80
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,366
I love you.

81
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,789
I raise you, Justine,

82
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,470
Have a good trip,

83
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,186
Come on.

84
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,618
Until then.

85
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,076
Hi, Wayne, how are you?
- Hey! Well, you alone at heart?

86
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:57,491
I console myself with wash laundering and
Then I stick my nose in the books.

87
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,902
Oh shit!
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.

88
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:37,829
Are you okay? - Yes, all right.
But this light makes me really ready.

89
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:42,210
Say. is this the whole weekend
remain so? - Well, as I know my luck.

90
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:43,374
God

91
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,626
There you go, who says's it.

92
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,715
Do you still have space in the machine?

93
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,799
You're the best.
And do not forget the sweets.

94
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,639
No, never.
as I could. - See you soon!

95
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,267
The windows were smashed and the
Tire was found dried sludge residues.

96
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:03,606
The investigators gave further known
that her body

97
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,272
in a nearby
Has found dumpster.

98
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,067
They assume,
that a connection

99
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:12,152
to the recently reported disappearance
of two other women there.

100
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,161
Hello, Anna. And?
You fly to London today?

101
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:22,451
No, only to friends in the north.
Nicole and you, will you really stay here?

102
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:26,455
Yes. the turkey pie
sizzles already in the oven. - Doswidanje.

103
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,081
Happy Thanksgiving.

104
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,002
Yes, all good.
I know, Dad

105
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,651
If it breaks up
I can do that too.

106
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:38,425
Okay. then we long afterwards,
I love you too.

107
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,100
You're not serious? - Please do not be angry,
my dad has suddenly appeared.

108
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,975
As a surprise, he has
the whole family invited to Aspen.

109
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,022
Okay.
- I'm about to pick up.

110
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,271
Come with me also.
A plane ticket I'll get you yet.

111
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,865
No, thank you.
- You can not stay here all alone.

112
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,951
Hi, Jus! - All good.
I get by, honest

113
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,031
I'm really sorry. I swear
I wanted to hang out with you.

114
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,032
But my dad has an extra
interrupted the campaign

00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:06,252
and the whole family will be there.
And it's Aspen. - All good, Nicole.

116
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,170
I understand that but everything
Family is family.

117
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,550
But promise me. that you do not
all the time on campus hang around.

118
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:15,091
Driving times and get some fresh air,
somewhere into the green.

119
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,474
You can take my baby,
- Better not, because if something goes wrong.

120
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:23,060
Please, take it now already.
I know you're very keen on it.

121
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,224
Thank you.

Thank you for your understanding. okay

Thank you.

Until then.

It is very quiet here
Quiet and peaceful.

00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,801
What does it say on the price tag?

170
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,774
I would like a discount.
- Student card?

171
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,857
I want a discount.

172
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,531
All right, I'll pay that.

173
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,245
Do I like.

174
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,158
But I want nothing from you.

175
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,383
Since you liked something nice for someone to do
and then you get it from a shit.

176
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:02,598
You've still never
stuck in the shit, Kristy.

177
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,722
Now it's your turn.

178
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,055
What is this ?!

179
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,428
Hey!

180
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,264
Are you okay?
- Some people I understand not easy.

181
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,728
On holidays
so turn some people on the wheel.

182
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:59,275
Probably. - Was there trouble?
If you followed someone? - No, I do not think so.

183
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,567
The situation was just kind of weird
as someone wanted to make me afraid.

184
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:07,192
Alright. But I pass on to you
you know that. I'm here.

185

Yes. I know.
And I take care of yourself.

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,865
Then nothing can happen yes.

Hey, all right with you? - Yes.

189
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,701
I just wanted to ...
No idea, just to hear your voice.

00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,958
Me is there something funny happened.
- What was that?

191
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,177
Are you alone?

192
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,805
Yes, Nicole is still driven away.

193
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,390
Why is that?
- Any family affair.

194
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,689
Why you gave me
not members know?

195
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,601
I wanted to give you no

Then I come to you now.

198
00:27:57,212 --> 00:28:00,020

Do me a favor,
enjoy the time with your family.

We'll see you again soon.

203
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,055
Oh well.
If that's really okay with you.

204
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm a grown-up girl.

205
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,521
Everything is fine.

206
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,530

Error: Server not found

213
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,526
Why not does that?

214
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,273
A beautiful room.

215
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,369
A handsome boy.

216
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,369
You really have everything. Kristy.

217
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,444
Wayne ...

218
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,778
Wayne! - Carry you to safety.

Kristy!

221
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,483
No, my name is Justine
- You are Kristy.

222
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,785
The hunt has begun.

223
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,837
Running rid of God, Kristy.

224
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,817
Scott e

225
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,151
Hey, Scott! Help!

229
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,832
Help!

What's the matter, Justine? - Closing the
Door, quickly. You should lock the door!

232
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:09,461
Off, Titus!

233
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:11,718
Who killed who?
Who are you talking about?

234
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,850
The line is also dead.

235
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:19,807
Nothing works.
We can call the help no more. - Okay.

236
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:21,814
Now please stop me sometimes too well.

237
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,729
So, you tell me now
again very slowly, what happened

238
00:43:25,764 --> 00:43:28,072
because I'm just stoned namely total.

239
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:29,316
Okay.

240
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,820
There are people. - Yes, dwell

241
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,494
And these people have
Dave and Wayne killed.

242
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:40,459
This is a crazy killer gang
Where did you get your phone?

243
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,380
Where is your cell phone, Scott?
Where is your damn phone!

244
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,792
Now not rotating through
- They're still there.

00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,429
Scott

246
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,141
I have a motion detector.

247
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:05,684
The light goes on,
when someone approaches the house.

248
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:08,192
You sit down at best.
Sit quietly go there.

249
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:10,613
I'll be right back
Titus, you stay here.

We can not wait until the police

00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,662
You are here

255
00:45:47,697 --> 00:45:49,255
Titus, good dog.

256
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,925
How many are there of those?
- Four. Four at least.

257
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,757
You stay here with Titus, okay.

My name is Justin Wills.
I'm here in the "Birch-College '.

Kristy ...

289
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,023
Your bad luck,

290
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:26,990
is found everywhere on campus.

291

Time to Die

296
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,012
Give me a smile, Kristy.

297
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,518
But I'm not Kristy.
Why do you do such a thing?

298
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:26,855
Beautiful hair you have
And a nice car.

299
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,275
Aaron ...

300
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,155
Aaron!

301
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:06,368

308
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,522
Justine?

309
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,444
Aaron!

310
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,401

Are you okay?
Now tell me, will you ...

316
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,804
No!

317
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:08,350
No! No ...

318
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,655
No!

319
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,612
Go to hell!

320
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,743
Go to hell,
you lousy piece of shit!

321
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,098
Come on.

322
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,552
Come on, Aaron

00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,929
I love you.

324
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,224
I love you. Justine,

325
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,070
You can do it.

326
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:54,970
nails

327
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,429
Did you Kristy killed?

328
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,563
Yes,

329
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,865
I wait in the car.

330
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,161
I'm coming.

331
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,502
Think of the photos for the album.

332
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,301
Connect

333
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,966
the album

334
01:13:07,001 --> 01:13:09,264
Kill Kristy,

335
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:14,979
Kristy is pretty,
innocent and sheltered

336
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,269
loading video

337
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,709
Six die in Austin.

338
01:13:41,744 --> 01:13:43,885
Eight in Portland.
Tucson wants to see blood.

339
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,639
Hell opens up.
Slaughter the innocent.

340
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:52,726
Neither God nor the law
can they protect.

341
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,665
I would not do.

342
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,996
What is this?

343
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,673
The boundary of the Predictable.

344
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:49,303
Ever heard of Heisenberg heard?
Your people are dead.

345
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,757
