1
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,125
Mom! Mom!

2
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,916
Mom!

3
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,666
Mom!

4
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,833
Mom! Mom!

5
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,625
<i>Dude, it pays more, bet on that.</i>

6
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,500
<i>Bro, listen.
The deal here is...</i>

7
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:54,000
<i>You gotta keep your odds low, okay?
Then you'll play to win big.</i>

8
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,000
-Got it?
-You're telling me?

9
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,416
Son, I was doing this
when you were still a baby.

10
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,916
Good for you, brother!

11
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,875
-Okay, okay. Write it. Mallorca.
-Mallorca.

12
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,125
-Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid.
-Arda Turan!

13
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,375
-Who cares about Arda? Barcelona it is.
-Barcelona.

14
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,583
-Exactly. I agree.
-They won the championship last season.

15
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,125
Dude, I like Catalans.
Catalans are good.

16
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,375
-Messi will score. Barcelona it is.
-Barcelona, okay.

17
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,250
-Write it down.
-Alright.

18
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,750
-Zaragoza vs Girona.
-Girona? (Enter this)

19
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,375
-I like this name. It's like "enter this bet".
-Okay, that's a likeable team.

20
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,708
-The name says it man: "enter this!".
-What about the odds?

21
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,875
-Okay, let's bet on this.
-Girona 1.9, Zaragoza 1.4.

22
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,416
-Okay, dude.
-Girona! (Enter this).

23
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,208
-Enter this bet! Yes.
-Okay, the last one. The last game.

24
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,375
No way I'd bet for Albacete,
I wouldn't play anyway.

25
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,583
Seyfi! Are you in, man?
You want to bet?

26
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,541
-Dude! Hello?
-Seyfi!

27
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,750
Seyfi, do you still have that headache?

28
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,375
Boss, enough with your fucking bets.

29
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,541
-My head's all fucked up because of you.
-Oh, man!

30
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,583
Bro, watch your words
or I'll fuck you like a chicken now.

31
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,541
Yavuz,
I bet you actually fucked a chicken before.

32
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,166
-What?
-Chicken, man, you know.

33
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,416
Chief, please,
not in front of the newbie.

34
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,666
Alright, alright. Just kidding man.
Don't get offended so easily.

35
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,041
-But I have plenty friends who fucked chicken.
-You and your friends, man!

36
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:37,333
Look, it's not about fucking the chicken.
No, it's about catching it.

37
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,541
Chief, why don't you tell us
about your first time?

38
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,916
-Was it with a goat or a cow?
-It was with an elephant!

39
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,333
My first was an elephant! OK?
Cut the crap now.

40
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,958
-Come on!
-Chief, come on.

41
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,916
-Arda!
-Hey, go easy on your chief.

42
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,750
-Come on!
-Who fucks an animal for their first time?

43
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,791
Son... haven't you served in the army?

44
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,625
70 percent of all Turkish men,
lose their virginity by fucking an animal.

45
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,875
-Whoa!
-Make it more like 20 percent chief!

46
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,750
He's a city boy, this one.
I bet his daddy took him to a brothel.

47
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,083
Did he?

48
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,708
Nah. It was some senior students
in high school, who took us to one.

49
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:23,416
Dude, I'm seasoned with brothels,
whores, and whatnot, boy.

50
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,625
Let me tell you a story.
He already knows this one.

51
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,958
-What?
-The one with the string.

52
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,083
Listen to this one.

53
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,000
I was heading down from Maslak highway.
I saw this chick, right.

54
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,750
And what a chick she was!
She was like amazing!

55
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,458
She was... how should I put it?

56
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,083
What was that called...
Victoria's... Sectr- or whatever.

57
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,958
-You mean the Victoria's Secret models?
-Yes! She was like one of them.

58
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,458
So hard to find, yeah.
Anyways, I picked her up... driving.

59
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,916
You picked her up?
Just like that?

60
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,208
-What do you mean?
-You say Victoria's Secret.

61
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,166
A Victoria's Secret model
in your car!

62
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,458
-She was a whore, man.
-Oh... Ok. Go on.

63
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,291
I picked her up, driving.
She had a mini skirt on.

64
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,125
She was wearing a low-cut top,
earrings and everything.

65
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,541
She was gorgeous.
Unbelievable.

66
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:10,250
Anyways. We arrived at the hotel,
we went upstairs to the room.

67
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,250
She started to get undressed.
She took off her skirt, the earrings.

68
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,458
She took off her high heels.
By the way, the room is dark.

69
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,833
And I was excited as hell.

70
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,125
I could hardly control myself.
She was so hot man!

71
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:27,708
Anyways. Finally,
I decided to make my move.

72
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,458
Slid my hand between the legs,
and there it was

73
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,250
a huge cock.

74
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,000
I was shocked,
and she laughed like you do now.

75
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,333
It was a cock man. A frigging cock!

76
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,125
-Fuck off! How the hell?
-What do you mean "how"?

77
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,750
Look, there was a string.

78
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,916
She pulled it up to her belly
and tied the string rope around her waist.

79
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,708
-It was huge too.
-What did you do?

80
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,458
What could I have possibly done?

81
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,958
Since we were already there,
I went all the way.

82
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,875
But next thing you know...
While I was doing my thing

83
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,958
...the son of a bitch started
jerking off, while I do him!

84
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,666
I was like "what the fuck!"

85
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,250
It was dirty enough as it is.

86
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,041
But she didn't stop.
I said "Cut that shit bro!"

87
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,791
So I'm pretty seasoned with
all kinds of this shit, boy.

88
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,166
Our religion teacher once said
it was awesome.

89
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,250
We asked him about anal sex right?
He replies:

90
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,791
“My son, why enter a shithole
when you have a rose garden next to it?"

91
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,916
Maybe I'm an ass man!
What do you care?

92
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,125
Our religion teacher also said
something very similar.

93
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,416
Do you prefer ass, Seyfi?

94
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,166
Yavuz, so, end of the day,
that woman gave it to your hand?

95
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,041
Stop it!

96
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,250
What if she'd said,
"Okay, my turn, bend over"?

97
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,250
-I have hemorrhoids.
-Wow! You mean you'd do it otherwise.

98
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,708
-That's right, he would.
-What's up, kiddo? Why are you laughing?

99
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,666
Sir, because you were laughing...
That's why.

100
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,708
-So, we entertained you with our jokes.
-No, sir, it's not like that.

101
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,791
-It was a funny story.
-What's so funny about it?

102
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,125
The woman turned out to be a man,
tying his junk.

103
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,041
-That's what I laughed at.
-So, you are saying that I fucked a guy.

104
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,750
-I didn't mean it that way, sir.
-No, you did.

105
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,708
-Right? He said that I fucked a guy.
-Yeah, Yavuz.

106
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,583
-He said that you fucked a guy.
-Okay, Yavuz, okay.

107
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,208
-No way, sir.
-Are you calling me a faggot?

108
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,125
-No, sir. No way.
-Wait. Come back here.

109
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,208
-Yavuz, leave the kid alone.
-Wait a minute.

110
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,041
-Akif, come here.
-Remzi, wait a minute.

111
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,875
Step away.
Officer, the boy didn't mean it.

112
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,166
He's not a boy anymore.
He can defend himself, okay?

113
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,375
Sir, go easy on him.
He's just a kid.

114
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:44,833
-What is this? Why are you touching me?
-Sir, he's just a kid.

115
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,625
-Step aside.
-I apologize on his behalf.

116
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,125
-Dude, you're getting on my nerves.
-Please, sir. Please.

117
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,583
-Look!
-Take it easy, sir.

118
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't get on my nerves!

119
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,041
-Don't piss me off!
-That's enough! Cut it out!

120
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,083
-Okay, we're leaving. Come on.
-Come on, Arda.

121
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,458
-Come on, let's go.
-Come on.

122
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,291
-Watch it.
-Come on.

123
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,458
If only you weren't cops.

124
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,666
-What did you just say?
-He didn't say anything, sir.

125
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,250
-The kid's talking to himself.
-You're totally getting on my nerves now.

126
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,291
-Please, sir.
-You're totally getting on my nerves!

127
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,000
-Sir, can you please just leave?
-Dude! You're pissing me off right now!

128
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,291
-Enough already!
-Please, sir.

129
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,291
Step away, man.

130
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,625
I'm curious...
let's see what you are going to do.

131
00:13:55,708 --> 00:14:00,208
Go on.
Do whatever you want.

132
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,833
What happens here stays here.
Right, Apo?

133
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,833
-Totally.
-Come on.

134
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,625
Go on, hit him.

135
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,500
Go on. Show us your moves.

136
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,375
Hit him already!

137
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:28,416
Son, what did you say to me?
The boss here is telling me to hit you.

138
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,041
Why don't you behave?

139
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,041
Hit him, hit him!

140
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,250
-Look, look.
-Who do you think you're messing with?

141
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,875
-Seyfi! What the hell is going on?
-Seyfi!

142
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,750
Pass me the lighter.

143
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,625
Give it back, you weasel.

144
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,333
All he says is that he felt like
losing his mind for a second.

145
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:48,750
He says it's not claustrophobia or anything.
He's feeling a bit better now.

146
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,041
Boss helped him calm down.

147
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,958
-Has this happened before?
-No.

148
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,250
One time, he felt dizzy in an elevator.

149
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,833
It wasn't like this, though.
This is different.

150
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,833
Claustrophobia could have
this kind of effect, sir.

151
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,916
-Are you okay, man?
-He's okay. Let's go.

152
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,083
I'm fine, sir.
I can drive. Come on.

153
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:28,458
-Boss?
-I said I could drive.

154
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:33,583
Seyfi, you should rest in the back.
Yavuz can drive. Come on.

155
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:38,541
Boss.
Why are you all looking at me like that?

156
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,000
I learned to drive when I was four.

157
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,541
I was sitting at the wheel of a bus,
on my dad's lap.

158
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,416
-Please. You're offending me.
-You're the man!

159
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Come on. Let's go.

160
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,125
-Such a diva!
-Stop talking nonsense.

161
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,291
-I feel really safe now!
-Come on, come on.

162
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,000
-You're fine.
-God bless him. He's fine.

163
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,916
I'm fine, okay.

164
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:40,750
<i>By the riverbank,
trees reaching into the air.</i>

165
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:46,000
<i>Green leaves everywhere.</i>

166
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,791
<i>If I can't have the one I want,</i>

167
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:56,166
<i>Death should come and claim her heart.</i>

168
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,875
<i>Come to me from the grapevine.</i>

169
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:06,291
<i>In a blooming dress, you look divine.</i>

170
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:11,125
<i>My love, let's go far away.</i>

171
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:16,000
<i>Before the patrols arrive.</i>

172
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:21,083
<i>Persian girl, Chechen girl,
You wear white and I wear pearl.</i>

173
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:26,833
<i>Let's go high up the mountains,
You smell the roses, I smell the iris.</i>

174
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:31,708
The night is black, and the cops are dark.
When in trouble, I am who you mark.

175
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:36,500
My name's Apo, call me and say "hello".
Knock, knock! And I'm there.

176
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,791
You are the man!

177
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:43,833
<i>We're not afraid, no way.</i>

178
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:51,208
<i>My dear love, come sway.
We're not afraid, no way.</i>

179
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,416
There you go!

180
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:30,541
<i>All units. We have responded to a call
from the Inceagac neighborhood.</i>

181
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,666
<i>We are waiting for backup.</i>

182
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,583
<i>Nearby units, be advised:
4455 is at the scene.</i>

183
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,875
<i>I repeat:
4455 is at the scene.</i>

184
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,875
What is it?
What is he saying?

185
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,625
We're on our way to the scene.

186
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,416
I'll let you know once we arrive.
Over.

187
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,666
-What is it, Apo?
-4455, bro.

188
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,625
They're calling for backup in Inceagac.

189
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:59,208
Seyfi. Inceagac is near, right?
Somewhere up there?

190
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,916
Yes, sir. It's really close.
I'll get us there.

191
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,458
Okay, it's official now,
we won't be getting any sleep tonight.

192
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,666
Beggars cannot be choosers.

193
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,875
I remember this Inceagac, but...

194
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,833
-Where did I hear about it?
-Look, sir.

195
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,875
I heard many stories about that place
when I was a kid.

196
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,083
Well...

197
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,875
-God, it's late and everything.
-What stories?

198
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,791
-I heard nasty stories.
-Wait, I know.

199
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,708
There's a famous shrine there, right?

200
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,208
Yes. There are many.
There are three just in that area.

201
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,291
Dude, stop talking nonsense.

202
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,791
How can there be nasty stories
in a place full of shrines?

203
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:53,833
Boss, it's not like that.
But that place is no good.

204
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:58,625
Weren't you in shock just a minute ago?
When did you wake up, pussy?

205
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,583
Dude, you don’t worry about me.

206
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,833
God damn it.
We've been on this road forever.

207
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:23,750
There was supposed to be a right turn,
but there's still no fucking sign of it.

208
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,083
You piece of shit radio!

209
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,208
Look, chief.
There's no communication at all, right?

210
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:33,750
-This radio is broken. Get rid of it.
-No, son. Look.

211
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,208
I receive signals.

212
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,166
And this asshole is supposed to know
how to get there.

213
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,791
Yavuz, cut the crap, man!

214
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,125
Chief, I've been driving on this road
for 10 years

215
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,166
but I have no memory of such a place.

216
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,250
Fuck!

217
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,416
Fuck!

218
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,791
-Seyfi, what happened?
-A man... A man passed by.

219
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,458
-What man?
-He was completely naked.

220
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,833
-So, where is he?
-I don't know!

221
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,833
-There's no one here, dude.
-Where is he? Show yourself!

222
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,458
Who's there?

223
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,333
-Shit.
-Hey!

224
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,500
-Shit.
-Hey! You assholes!

225
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:29,375
-Who are you, you son of a bitch?
-Come out, you bastard!

226
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,458
You bust our balls,
we'll rip your balls off!

227
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,208
We'll fuck you motherfucking son of a bitch!

228
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:46,250
-Sir, what's this?
-What's what?

229
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,708
Were they here before?

230
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:53,000
-No, I'm seeing them for the first time.
-What are these scratches?

231
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,375
It's nothing.
Kids must have scribbled some shit.

232
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:59,333
-Who did this?
-You're asking million-dollar questions.

233
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,458
What the hell?

234
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:23,625
So? Was it the frogs then?
All jump up together and hit the van?

235
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:37,250
Boss.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

236
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,000
Come on, bro.

237
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,916
-I'll catch you!
-Okay.

238
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,875
-I'll catch you, you sons of bitches!
-Yavuz, it's okay. Come here.

239
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,000
Dude.
Are you sure you saw a man?

240
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:33,500
-Shut your damn mouth.
-Man... Maybe it was animal?

241
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,583
It was a fucking frog! Alright?
A frog!

242
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:50,125
<i>-What is this?
-I don't know.</i>

243
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,541
<i>-Pass! Is it over?
-Yes. Come on.</i>

244
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,416
<i>-Alright. How many did I get right?
-I don't know.</i>

245
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,541
<i>-How much time do I have left?
-1.5 minutes.</i>

246
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:58,625
<i>Okay.</i>

247
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,458
Whackjob!

248
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:38,291
My father used to say you shouldn't
talk about your dreams at night.

249
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,708
Good one.

250
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,833
When my mother was six months pregnant with me,
my name came to my father in a dream.

251
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,958
They hand him a baby and
say "This is Arda".

252
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,375
My parents are really into dreams.

253
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:59,416
So they didn’t even think twice
about it. They named me Arda.

254
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,791
God bless their souls.

255
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,833
Boss, I'll tell you something,
but you can't tell anyone.

256
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,291
Okay.

257
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,708
-Promise?
-I promise.

258
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,791
When I was a child, I had this close friend.
His name was Coskun.

259
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:36,000
He would come to our house
every once in a while.

260
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:39,416
We'd go out, go to Kadikoy,
to the movies and stuff.

261
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,125
One day, after seeing a movie,

262
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,916
his dad had died recently.

263
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,041
He told me about how
he was in the room when his dad died,

264
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,500
and that he saw his soul rise
from his dead body.

265
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,875
-He said he actually saw it.
-Saw what?

266
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:58,208
The soul rising, leaving the body.

267
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:02,416
-He was crying the whole time.
-The soul leaving the body?

268
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,166
He said he saw the man's soul.

269
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:13,208
His older brother was also there,
but he didn't see anything. He swore.

270
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,125
Anyways, we said to each other:

271
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:21,791
Whoever dies first, shall appear to the other
without scaring him.

272
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,875
We made a promise.

273
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,250
We were on a dark alley.
There was no one around.

274
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,625
We scared ourselves.
And we hastily left the alley.

275
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,208
I walked him to the ferry.

276
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,625
I saw him go through the turnstiles.
I saw him get on the ferry.

277
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:45,500
Then I went home.
Maybe 15 minutes later,

278
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,833
my parents were not home,

279
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:53,541
I went to my room and changed.
I got in bed.

280
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:58,083
But I couldn't sleep.
I was still a bit restless.

281
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:02,625
-I pulled the duvet up and passed out.
-So what, kid?

282
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:07,458
I had this dream.
There are lots of people around me.

283
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:10,625
They are all glaring at me.

284
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,291
You know how you fear something in your dream
but you don't quite know what it is?

285
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:17,000
I feel such a fear inside.

286
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:21,375
Then Coskun comes out from the crowd.

287
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,875
He comes and holds my hand.

288
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,375
He says: "Don't be afraid, Arda.
It's me. Coskun."

289
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,583
Then, I wake up, soaked in sweat.
But I'm still dreaming.

290
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:41,375
I hear moans
coming from my mom's room.

291
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,750
I listen.

292
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:53,208
Suddenly, it stops.
As if the people inside disappeared.

293
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:59,416
I look at the living room.
The TV is on, but there's only static.

294
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,041
I go turn it off.

295
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:08,458
I look towards the hallway.
There's someone in my room! I can feel it.

296
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:16,708
Coskun is in my room.
The thought of seeing him scares me.

297
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,791
I run to my mom's room.

298
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,958
I keep banging on the door,
screaming "mom, mom".

299
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,291
Then, I woke up for real this time.

300
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,333
That afternoon, we received a call.

301
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:44,375
I could tell from my mom's voice
on the phone. It was so weird.

302
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:48,791
-Coskun had been hit by a car that night.
-Holy shit!

303
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,083
I swear to God.

304
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:56,041
Mom says I couldn't function for 10 days.
But I don't remember anything.

305
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,000
She says
she left food in front of my door.

306
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:03,708
I've kept having that same dream.
I had it this morning as well.

307
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,625
It's like I'm still dreaming.

308
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,916
You're the first person
I've told about this, Boss.

309
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,291
When was this,
how long before your parents' deaths?

310
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:28,583
I lost them about a year later.
Car crash.

311
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,541
Arda, I have something to tell you.

312
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:40,250
I've been meaning to tell you this
ever since the day I met you.

313
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,500
The day when your uncle
placed you in my care.

314
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,083
What is it, Boss Remzi?

315
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:51,958
You still don't realize it.
If only it could stay that way.

316
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,583
What is it?
What are you talking about?

317
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,958
-Do you see anyone here, other than us?
-The guys.

318
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:11,708
Look around. But not like that.
Look around, taking it all in.

319
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:15,750
-Is there anyone here, other than us?
-What am I supposed to feel?

320
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,916
Boss Remzi, who is that?

321
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,541
This is the first time
someone other than me is seeing it.

322
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,250
Get away you!

323
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,083
-Arda, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

324
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,458
-Breathe.
-I'm fine.

325
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,875
Take deep breaths, son.

326
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,083
-I'm okay. Where's my gun?
-Are you okay?

327
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,041
How is everyone?
Any broken bones?

328
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:54,458
-Fuck you and your driving!
-I'll fuck you up serious, Yavuz!

329
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:57,791
And you're still talking!
Look at us, asshole!

330
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,750
Fuck off!

331
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,041
Were you the ones
who got in front of the van?

332
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,916
Who did then?

333
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,291
Come on, move it.

334
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,291
Move it.

335
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,416
Why the fuck is he laughing?

336
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,541
Did you fall into the creek, Sir?
Did you have an accident?

337
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,583
Why the hell are you laughing?
Why the hell are you laughing!

338
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,583
Don't do it, Sir. Don't hit him.
He's a bit slow.

339
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,500
Fuck this shit!

340
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:22,166
God.
Who did we hit?

341
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:27,125
Seyfi, Yavuz, come with me.

342
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,666
We ran over that man.

343
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:14,000
-Where is it, bro? What did we hit?
-We hit something, dude.

344
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,458
-We ran over the guy.
-We hit him. There were noises.

345
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:19,708
-Are you sure?
-What do you mean?

346
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:22,458
-Then where is he?
-How the hell should I know?

347
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,958
He sure as hell didn't fly away!

348
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:27,291
I don't fucking know!
We hit that man, and he's gone now!

349
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:36,833
-Seyfi, your face is bleeding.
-So is yours.

350
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,666
-Where?
-Your face. It's bleeding.

351
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:57,083
No radio. No phone.
We properly fucked up the van!

352
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,958
Do you people have a phone?

353
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,500
What is this damn place called?

354
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,916
Inceagac.

355
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:17,250
This is Inceagac. It's the way to the woods.
You should go through the grove.

356
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:20,541
-We've arrived then.
-You mean the place behind those trees?

357
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,625
Yes, behind that grove.
200 meters at most.

358
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,708
-Cut the fucking crap. Come on.
-What? Where, sir?

359
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,541
We'll follow you.
You'll lead the way.

360
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:32,208
-You should sit for a while and rest, Sir.
-Sister, we've got work to do. We're going now.

361
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:36,583
I said it for your own good.
If you have work to do, you should go indeed.

362
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:41,041
-It's your bread and butter after all.
-Hey, what the hell is the matter with you?

363
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,541
Move it!

364
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:41,166
Chief, isn't that our guys' car?

365
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,791
-Back in the Ottoman days...
-Shut up!

366
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,041
Okay, okay, Yavuz.
Let him speak. Speak!

367
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:52,291
Back in the Ottoman days,
this place was a police station.

368
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:58,250
When I was a child, it was a stable.
No one comes here now. Deserted.

369
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,916
What are you doing here, Sir?

370
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Seyfi, did you know about this place?

371
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:11,125
Chief, I heard about it
when I was a kid.

372
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,416
It was a police station
back in the Ottoman days.

373
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,708
-Chief. Come on, let's check on our guys.
-Okay.

374
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:23,208
Everybody be careful, okay?
Come on.

375
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:36,375
Your uncle placed you under my care, Arda.
Don't worry, I have the key to all this.

376
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,083
What the hell is this?

377
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,583
All units! All units!

378
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,458
It's not working.

379
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:34,958
-Nothing works in this car!
-Seyfi, enough! Get a grip!

380
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:43,083
Seyfi. Calm down, dude. Calm down.
We have the gun, we have the badge.

381
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,666
-Okay?
-Okay, chief.

382
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,625
-How does our national anthem begin?
-"Fear not".

383
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:51,875
Just like that!
Come on, boy.

384
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,458
Hey! Stop!
Don't run! Asshole!

385
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:00,333
Fuck the police.
You goddamn sons of bitches.

386
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:19,583
-Chief, I'm going in.
-Boss, come on. We're going in.

387
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:22,208
Watch the back.
Come on.

388
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,375
Easy.

389
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,291
What the hell is this smell?

390
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,125
There's nothing here.

391
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:36,958
-Can anybody hear me?
-Is anybody there? Hello?

392
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:41,166
-Is there anybody in there?
-We're talking to you, damn it!

393
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,083
Shit!

394
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:40,916
What the hell?
What's going on here?

395
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,583
Look over here.

396
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,833
Look at us, damn it!

397
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,791
Who the hell are you?
Where is your unit?

398
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:58,083
Stop your crying!

399
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,916
Where is your unit, dude?

400
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,625
Yavuz, check for his ID.

401
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,666
There's nothing on him.

402
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:26,666
What have you done to yourself?

403
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,333
Were you the ones who called for backup?

404
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:35,375
-What the fuck is going on here?
-Son, where is your unit?

405
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,375
Where is your unit?

406
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,208
-Seyfi.
-Yes?

407
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,500
Come here, take him to the car.

408
00:47:56,583 --> 00:48:00,083
-Now! Move it!
-Alright, sir.

409
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,250
Come with me, man.

410
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,291
Fuck.

411
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:48,333
Bro, it's pitch black down there.
There's no way in hell I'm going down.

412
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:55,791
Yavuz, you stay here with Arda.
Apo and I will go check.

413
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,541
-Come on, Apo.
-Boss, I'm coming too.

414
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,666
Are you sure, man?

415
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:26,291
Fuck this shit!

416
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:38,458
Brother, what's your name?
Did you call for backup?

417
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:23,708
Fuck!

418
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:27,500
Fuck! Fuck!

419
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,166
Fuck

420
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:52,416
Fuck...
What the hell is this?

421
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,666
Boss, let's get out of here.

422
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:47,208
What the hell have you done here?

423
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:49,208
Boss, run! Run!

424
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,625
Arda, run!

425
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,916
Remzi! Remzi!

426
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,916
Remzi!

427
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,125
Easy, boy.

428
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:38,416
I felt like...
I was about to pass out.

429
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,416
You're fine. Come on.
We'll leave after the coffee.

430
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:47,583
-We have a long way to go.
-I feel so weird.

431
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:53,291
Where am I? What am I doing?
I'm all dizzy. I don't understand.

432
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:57,125
Not everything has a clear answer, Arda.

433
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:03,125
Let me put it this way:
Tonight, we're at a crossroads.

434
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:07,875
Maybe it's just you and me,
maybe just you, maybe all of us.

435
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:10,000
I don't know.

436
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:16,416
We were summoned here tonight.
There was no call for backup.

437
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:20,375
-We were summoned here tonight.
-What, who?

438
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:27,333
I felt it the moment we stepped in.
But I thought it was not possible. I was wrong.

439
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:32,083
So, you know what's going on right now?

440
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:36,625
When I was a kid, I used to see them
with my grandmother. We used to talk.

441
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,333
Someone is looking for something.
So, it keeps wandering.

442
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:43,291
It's haunting.
I can feel it.

443
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:47,750
You can too.
You can feel it on the back of your neck.

444
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,500
You just know that something's up.

445
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:54,041
This has been happening to you
since you were a child, Arda.

446
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,458
Don't you see?

447
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:54,708
Who the hell are you,
you son of a bitch?

448
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:57,708
How dare you chain the police?
Bastard!

449
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:46,583
Who the hell are you, you son of a bitch?
Speak, damn it!

450
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,583
Don't you have a tongue?

451
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:36,208
I see you're here to join us tonight.

452
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:42,291
And we're here to welcome you
the best way we can.

453
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:57,916
On a night like this,
when doors open and realms unite,...

454
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
...we're here in this chamber together.

455
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:12,750
Hell is not a place you go.

456
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:22,041
You carry Hell with you at all times.

457
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:30,208
You carry it inside you.

458
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:41,208
We are your humble companions
on the road that fate chose for you.

459
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:53,375
While the stones fall into place,
we can only be shepherds for you.

460
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,916
And tonight,...

461
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,375
...if fate put you first among the creatures
that we are going to herd,...

462
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:10,291
...there's nothing else we can do
but guide you.

463
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:07,208
Don't do it! Don't do it!

464
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:12,875
-Apo! Apo!
-What are you doing? Son of a bitch!

465
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,791
Apo...

466
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:21,000
-Son of a bitch!
-Apo, don't worry!

467
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:23,333
It's going to be okay.

468
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,166
Stop it!
You son of a bitch!

469
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,625
Don't do it...

470
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,666
Don't! No!

471
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,791
Bro! Bro!

472
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:17,166
What have you done?
What have you done!

473
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:26,250
You die as you sleep,
you resurrect as you wake up.

474
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:31,750
So, fear not.

475
01:09:39,916 --> 01:09:45,166
-Son, what is your name?
-We are the goddamn law!

476
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,416
Do you think your law is here?

477
01:09:57,208 --> 01:10:05,375
-What is your name, son?
-Yavuz. Damn it, it's Yavuz!

478
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:15,333
Yavuz, you look like a tough young man.
You're scared, but you look tough.

479
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:20,458
The human soul is corrupt.
It only worships power.

480
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:24,833
It keeps searching
for new things to worship.

481
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:31,333
Because it has boundaries,
drawn by its masters.

482
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:34,166
Who the hell are you?

483
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:43,000
Are you insane? Are you insane?

484
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:56,083
-Boss Remzi!
-Yavuz, close your eyes.

485
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:59,291
-Close your eyes, Yavuz!
-Boss!

486
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:04,875
Are you ready to stop worshipping power and
unite with us?

487
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:08,125
Are you ready to be one
with the cosmos?

488
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:15,333
Are you ready to give up your worldly eyes
and open your eyes to what's beyond?

489
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,041
Open your heart to me, son.

490
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:23,416
-Open your mind to me.
-I can't. I can't.

491
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:28,416
Please, don't.

492
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:50,541
-Open your mind to me, son.
-Please, don't.

493
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:54,583
Don't do it.
I'm begging you, please.

494
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:07,625
Yavuz.

495
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:44,666
Open the eyes of your heart, Yavuz.

496
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:14,166
Don't let me down, Yavuz.

497
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,166
Let's begin.

498
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:46,875
Come on, Yavuz.
Show us that you are the right passenger.

499
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,583
I'm begging you, don't do it.
Don't do it.

500
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:14,083
Open your heart to us, Yavuz.
Don't stop, and it will open.

501
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,958
Open your mind.

502
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:25,958
Don't stop, and it will open, Yavuz.
Open your heart to us, son.

503
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:33,125
Come on, dear. Come on, Yavuz.
Come on, Yavuz. Come on.

504
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:36,166
Come on!

505
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:18,791
Yavuz, you're not opening your heart.
You're not.

506
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:22,958
It should be wide open.
Otherwise, it's no good.

507
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:28,375
Open your mind.

508
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:30,125
No... No...

509
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:10,250
Maybe the honor will be yours, Arda.

510
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,708
Come to me! Come here!

511
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:21,291
He's just a kid!

512
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,250
I wasn't wrong, Arda.

513
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:34,625
Come...

514
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:53,833
Remzi, I thought it was just you.
But you're two passengers here.

515
01:20:53,916 --> 01:21:00,791
A thousand thanks to you, son.
You took care of this boy, you helped him.

516
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:06,958
And now, he's ready to understand himself.
I can see it in his eyes.

517
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:09,541
You saw it too, right?

518
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,083
Boss! Boss!

519
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:49,208
Remzi! Remzi!

520
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:52,625
Remzi! It's okay.
Everything's okay.

521
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,458
Backup's on its way. Just look at me.
Look into my eyes.

522
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,000
Hang in there...

523
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:08,958
"Whoever dies first, shall appear to the other
without scaring him."

524
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:14,708
-Remember, Arda?
-Don't do this! Don't go!

525
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:20,166
I made a promise to your uncle.

526
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:28,375
If you get harmed,
he'll hold me responsible in the afterlife.

527
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:42,791
-He's here, man. He's here.
-You don't need to be afraid.

528
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:50,458
I have only one key in this life.
And it's yours now.

529
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:25,416
Arda...

530
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:29,833
Everything ends, but...

531
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:33,000
everything starts anew.

532
01:25:36,041 --> 02:51:09,410
Everything ends, but...
