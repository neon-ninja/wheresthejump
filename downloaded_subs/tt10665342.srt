1
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,346
"W" who?

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:17,350
WURG 94.9, the Urge,

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,269
Haddonfield's home for rock.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,770
I'm Willie the Kid,

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,856
and there's n-n-nothing
you can do about it.

6
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,066
Corey, you're a lifesaver.

7
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,567
Hi.

8
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,152
How've you been? Come on in.

9
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,573
Roger! Corey's here!

10
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,909
Sorry this is last-minute,
but Andrea got a stomach bug

11
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,120
- and literally just called me.
- Oh, it's okay.

12
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,788
It's Roger's company
Halloween party,

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,457
and I could care less, but...
Roger!

14
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,918
Hope he's better at childcare
than he is at yard work.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,128
You know, next spring,

16
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,212
you should consider
some perennials.

17
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,839
Hydrangeas could really

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,590
- balance out that dogwood.
- Saving for college?

19
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,384
- Where did you say you're going?
- Oh, I'm applying

20
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,136
to a few different
engineering programs.

21
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,304
Just saving money this year
so I can go next fall.

22
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,682
Jeremy, the sitter's here!

23
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,272
Jeremy!

24
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,988
Jeremy!

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,490
Ah! You! I'm gonna get you!

26
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,119
I'm gonna get you.

27
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,164
Crash landing! Kaboom!

28
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,373
Oh!

29
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,791
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,002
Can you show me how to make
a Thunder Bomber?

31
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,503
Number one of all time.

32
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,964
- My dad can do the best.
- No pressure.

33
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,924
Yeah, I'll sure give it
a shot, little dude.

34
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,509
You gonna be good
for Mr. Corey?

35
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,762
- Corey. Could I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,555
Here comes the Thunder Bomber!

37
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,016
I'm gonna put the candy
on the porch.

38
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,602
Trick-or-treat kids
can help themselves.

39
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,896
Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

40
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,315
She made zucchini
bread. It's actually good.

41
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,359
You have my number.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,860
- Okay.
- If there's an emergency,

43
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,653
but we'll just be
right down the street.

44
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,489
Crash!

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,866
And there is one thing
I need to tell you.

46
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,702
Since last Halloween...
All the events and,

47
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,206
you know, the headlines
of Michael Myers...

48
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,041
Jeremy's been afraid
of the dark.

49
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,460
He's been
wetting the bed at night.

50
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,047
And, um, bedtime has been
difficult.

51
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,465
I can hear you!

52
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,175
Uh, I can read him a story
or something.

53
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,886
- Does he have a favorite book?
- Then once he goes to bed,

54
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,471
he talks in his sleep.

55
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,931
Says he hears voices.

56
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,724
He's just really
sensitive to things

57
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,559
- that give him bad dreams.
- Right. All that just sounds

58
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,436
like normal kid
imagination stuff, right?

59
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,274
No TV and no more candy.

60
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,112
You guys can play
till 8:30, 8:45.

61
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,447
Then he should go to bed.

62
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,282
- Easy money.
- Yes.

63
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,368
Gonna come play with me or what?

64
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,453
That sounds like a threat.

65
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,247
It's Halloween.

66
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,582
We're gonna have
a good time tonight.

67
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,757
Oh.

68
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,217
- Ugh.
- Look, man, we can

69
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,428
shut it off if you're scared
of monster movies.

70
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,638
No. No. You're scared.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,016
I'm 21 years old.
I don't get scared.

72
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,226
You're scared because you know
Michael Myers is...

73
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,186
still out there.

74
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,564
Boogeyman's gonna get you.

75
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,774
He's not gonna get me.

76
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,736
Michael Myers kills
babysitters, not kids.

77
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,952
Okay, that's actually
pretty disgusting

78
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,954
and probably not appropriate
for kids.

79
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,622
Why don't we
shut this off, and...

80
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,041
we can play hide-and-seek
before bed.

81
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,625
Your parents are gonna
be home soon and...

82
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,627
I don't want to play
no hide-and-seek.

83
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,005
It's stupid.
I want to watch this movie.

84
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,507
And I don't really feel like
pretending to be best friends

85
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,801
with an ugly-ass boy babysitter.

86
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,641
Okay, five minutes,
and then you're going to bed.

87
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,977
You suck at babysitting.

88
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm not a babysitter.

89
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,307
Jeremy!

90
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,559
Turn that movie off!

91
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,064
Jeremy?

92
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,069
What are you doing?

93
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,496
Jeremy?

94
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,310
Jeremy!

95
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,649
Jeremy?

96
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,193
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

97
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,034
Boo!

98
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,080
This isn't funny, Jeremy.

99
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,088
Jeremy!

100
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,694
Jeremy?

101
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,873
Help! Corey, help!

102
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,119
Jeremy?

103
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,627
Jeremy?

104
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,966
Jeremy?

105
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,762
He's gonna get you!

106
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,265
He's gonna get you
when you least expect it.

107
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,526
- Is it your bedtime, Corey?
- Okay, Jeremy...

108
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,570
"Come out,
come out, wherever you are."

109
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,572
You got me, buddy.
Okay, let me out.

110
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,032
- Are you scared?
- Okay?

111
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,950
"I'm 21. I'm not scared."

112
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,327
Jeremy, let me out. Let me out!

113
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,623
You little shit!
Let me out of here!

114
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,125
Michael Myers.

115
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,210
Jeremy, it's not funny, okay?

116
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,133
Hey, you're gonna
get us both in trouble.

117
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,805
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!

118
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,849
You little shit!

119
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,060
I'm gonna kill you, Jeremy!

120
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,853
Boo!

121
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,606
What was that?

122
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,235
Jeremy!

123
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,322
- Oh, no! Oh, God, no! Please!
- Jeremy!

124
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,783
- Oh, no. Oh, God.
- Jeremy!

125
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,701
Oh, my God! Jeremy!

126
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,331
- Jeremy.
- Jeremy!

127
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,125
God, please, no!

128
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,754
What have you done?!

129
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,191
Haddonfield was a peaceful town.

130
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,778
And then one Halloween night
many years ago,

131
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,405
all of that was lost.

132
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,369
Michael Myers was pure evil.

133
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,704
He took our dreams

134
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,498
and turned them into nightmares.

135
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:56,049
As he was locked away
in his prison...

136
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,803
...I disappeared into mine.

137
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,313
And then, as I predicted,

138
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,191
40 years later, he escaped,

139
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,902
and Haddonfield was once again
forced to confront

140
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,987
this man in a mask.

141
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,916
His senseless brutality
ravaged my community...

142
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,962
...and killed my daughter.

143
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,301
And then he vanished.

144
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,847
Impossible?

145
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,932
Perhaps.

146
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,978
Truth would evolve into legend

147
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,398
as people searched
for motive and meaning,

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,526
looking in the shadows
for their boogeyman.

149
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,659
It was an accident.

150
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,287
In the years that followed,

151
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,248
the people of Haddonfield
descended into a plague

152
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,668
of grief, of blame, of paranoia.

153
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,212
Do you think he's come back?

154
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,049
Michael doesn't use guns.

155
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,718
The suffering Michael caused

156
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,179
became an infection
passing on to people

157
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,222
who never even crossed his path.

158
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,809
And as the town
turned in on itself,

159
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:33,897
I made a promise not to let
fear rule my life anymore.

160
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,983
I bought a home.

161
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,487
A place to live
with love and trust.

162
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,905
Not a trap.

163
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,115
Not a place to hide.

164
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,619
Hey.

165
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,287
It has been four years

166
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,040
since I last saw my monster.

167
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,797
So here I am, a survivor
attempting to share my story

168
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,299
and find healing.

169
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,263
Michael Myers was
the personification of evil.

170
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,019
It's theirs.

171
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,271
It's their wedding rings.

172
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,652
It's up to each of us

173
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,862
whether or not we lock the door

174
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,115
and find our resolve...

175
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,535
...or let him inside.

176
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,423
Let it inside.

177
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,515
Let evil...

178
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,267
inside.

179
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,898
Allyson! Darn it!

180
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,651
- Honey, I'm so sorry!
- What is it?

181
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,069
Oh, fuck!

182
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,489
Um, it's my pie.
I put a pie in the oven.

183
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,241
Oh, shit!

184
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,618
Oh, I must have forgotten
to set the timer.

185
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,328
Damn it!

186
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,831
Darn it!
No, no, no, no, Oh, no.

187
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,499
I can get a pie from the store.

188
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,086
No! I wanted to bake you
a pumpkin pie.

189
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,796
It's a Halloween tradition.

190
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,511
- Are you...
- I got to go.

191
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,096
- I'm late for work.
- Okay.

192
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,057
But do you have your costume
for the party?

193
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,100
I told you,
I don't want to go alone.

194
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,935
So I'm not going.

195
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,356
Oh.

196
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,280
Giving you the Urge,
with Willie the Kid.

197
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,324
Haddonfield's home for rock.

198
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,701
It is four days until Halloween.

199
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,745
Can you believe it?

200
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,456
It's time to lock your doors,
grab your knife for the fight.

201
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,999
You ready? You ready in case

202
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,126
the Boogeyman decides
to come out and play?

203
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,670
I know I am.

204
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,755
But let's talk about that
Michael Myers for a minute.

205
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,424
How does one man get shot at,
stabbed up

206
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,260
and then he fall
down the street and get back up

207
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,180
to scare the piss out of
everybody in Haddonfield?

208
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,808
Let me tell you how...
'cause this isn't a man.

209
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,687
This is more than a man.
This is a beast.

210
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,522
One that doesn't bleed...

211
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,483
I'm pretty sure
that was in the change order.

212
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,735
Hold-hold on a second, Shannon.

213
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,570
Hey, Corey, you're late!

214
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,531
You're late again!

215
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,574
It's been four years.

216
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,534
Where y'all at?

217
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,494
Training for the big day,
perhaps?

218
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,579
Getting yourself in the spirit?

219
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
This Boogeyman been sitting
in hibernation,

220
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,126
but trust me, y'all,
he'll be back.

221
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,046
I'm Willie the Kid,
and I'll be creeping it real

222
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,381
on 94.9 WUR...

223
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,383
Corey, you got a second?

224
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,099
What do you think?

225
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,768
Yeah.

226
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,353
Get it registered.

227
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,272
Get some new plates.

228
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,358
- I got no use for it no more.
- Are you serious?

229
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,527
With a good engine pushing you,
finally make it

230
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,696
to work on time,
you know what I mean?

231
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,197
Does it work?

232
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,325
Yeah, it works,
just kind of shitty.

233
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,957
Hey, uh, Ronald?

234
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,126
Thanks.

235
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,878
No problem, kid.

236
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,774
You're under arrest.

237
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,859
For being the prettiest girl
I know.

238
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,194
That's nice, Doug.

239
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,571
Is that why you pulled me over?

240
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,074
No. I pulled you over
'cause I miss you.

241
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,533
You miss me?

242
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,077
Just kidding.

243
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,328
Pulled you over
'cause it looks like

244
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,746
your muffler's about
to fall off.

245
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,247
Better get that fixed
before you have a bigger

246
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,541
problem on your hands.

247
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,338
You gonna buy something or what?

248
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,427
I could've drove here.

249
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,970
Chill.
I'm the designated driver.

250
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,347
- I know how to drive.
- Don't mess up my car, please.

251
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,807
- I'm not gonna mess up your car.
- All right?

252
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,642
- Don't mess it up.
- Chill.

253
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,269
- His dad is...
- I got my license.

254
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,354
It's no hating on. Come on.

255
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,648
- Billy. I.D.?
- So what's the plan?

256
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,775
- Give me the I.D. 
-I.D.?

257
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,235
- Yeah.
- It got confiscated last week.

258
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,570
- I told you.
- She's got the money.

259
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,821
- You don't have your I.D.?
- Wait. You what?

260
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,031
- Wait. Hold on. Hey, yo!
- I lost it.

261
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,241
Wait. New friend.

262
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,702
What, drinking a little milk.

263
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,454
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I like milk, too.

264
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,330
Look, here's the deal, man.

265
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,041
We're seniors, okay?

266
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,335
We've been practicing for our
show the whole year, you know.

267
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,337
Loading up for,
uh, tonight's game and...

268
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,630
Well, we're in
the fucking marching band.

269
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,300
We were just hoping you could
be a cool new friend, you know.

270
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,843
Just buy us
a couple of six-packs.

271
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,184
Just-just for me and my crew.
Come on, man.

272
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,977
Uh, no.

273
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,563
No?

274
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,106
No-no, thank you? What?

275
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,566
- No, I can't.
- Oh, wait.

276
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,735
- I know who you are.
- You did something messy.

277
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,945
- I can't believe they let you off.
- Well, who is he?

278
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,489
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

279
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,033
You're that psycho babysitter.

280
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,326
He killed that kid, didn't he?

281
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,994
- Yep.
- Killed a kid and too pussy

282
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,371
- to buy us some fucking beer?
- Guys, you know what?

283
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,622
Let's just fucking
forget about it.

284
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's just go to the game, okay?

285
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,625
- You're just a little pedo.
- Look at him.

286
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,668
- Let him know, Terry.
- That what you are?

287
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,919
A little fucking pedo creep?

288
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,379
- That's right.
- Get in his face, Terry.

289
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,963
What kind of
fucked-up kid are you?

290
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:14,756
- That's right. -Right.
- So where's your next victim?

291
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,841
- Whoa!
- What the fuck?!

292
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,842
Are you kidding me, man?

293
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,219
Oh, shit.

294
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,473
- Look at you.
- What the fuck, Terry?

295
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,891
Got fucking milk everywhere.

296
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,601
- Holy shit.
- Look what you did.

297
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,145
Hey! Assholes!

298
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,730
Knock it off!

299
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,898
- We're not doing anything.
- We're just talking, miss.

300
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,733
- We're messing around.
- Ma'am.

301
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,485
Hey, guys.

302
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,736
Would you look at this?

303
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,446
I mean, a psycho
meets a freak show.

304
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,781
- Wow.
- Can't believe it.

305
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,408
This is a match made in heaven.

306
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,159
- Hey, come on. Look at me.
- Ta-ta for now.

307
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,619
Let's go, y'all.

308
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,413
Michael Myers.

309
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,086
Are you the psycho
or the freak show?

310
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,922
Hey, Margo, do you want to go
to the school play on Saturday?

311
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,757
- Yeah, sure, Terry.
- Have fun.

312
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,931
So, do you want to do it,
or you want me to?

313
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,110
Look at it.

314
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,111
Are you kidding?

315
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,320
It looks great on you.

316
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,031
I'm sure it does,
but I'm not going.

317
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,950
Once you put the whole outfit
on, you'll love it.

318
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,245
I say if it's not sexy,
it's not Halloween.

319
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,915
Well, someone's getting into
the spirit of things.

320
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,796
This gentleman had an accident
and needs a little fix-up.

321
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,923
You have
significant inflammation.

322
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,135
Um, I'm gonna be nice
and numb it here

323
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,304
so my assistant can
clean it up really well,

324
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,682
and then I will get back
and close it with a suture.

325
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,521
You're gonna feel
a little bit of a pinch here.

326
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,150
Cute, isn't she?

327
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,485
I don't... Ow!

328
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,320
- Jesus Christ!
- Sorry. Sorry.

329
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,905
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Allyson, what are you doing?

330
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,281
- It's my fault. Sorry.
- Allyson!

331
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,407
- No.
- Sorry, sorry.

332
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,159
No. No, my fault.
It was my fault.

333
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,994
- I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez.
- What a mess.

334
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,455
Just clean it up
and get a goddamn sterile kit.

335
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,040
And give him a tetanus shot.

336
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,042
I'll be back.

337
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,511
You shouldn't let that guy
talk to you like that.

338
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,766
It's gonna make you sad, even
if you don't think it does.

339
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,644
I've dealt with much worse.

340
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,022
But thank you.

341
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,526
Anyway, I've just been
dealing with it.

342
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,779
Well, I'm supposed to
get this promotion.

343
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,573
- But either way, it's just...
- Is it worth it?

344
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,536
What'd you do?

345
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,246
- Uh...
- To your hand?

346
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,748
Uh, I was at work, and then
I had a little accident.

347
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,709
- So your job sucks, too.
- Hmm?

348
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,460
Where do you work?
What do you do?

349
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,879
- Oh, a mechanic shop.
- Don't move.

350
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,549
Don't want to get infected.

351
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,217
So my car's been rattling.

352
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,927
- Rattling?
- Yeah.

353
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,179
Uh, it's just your exhaust
system clamp's come loose.

354
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,973
It's an easy fix.
It takes like five minutes.

355
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,017
Super cinchy.

356
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,770
You just need a lift
and two screws.

357
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,938
"Cinchy"?

358
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,399
You don't
have to fix it right now.

359
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,777
Yeah, I don't have
my stuff, but...

360
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,988
I am at the shop tomorrow.

361
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,197
I can fix it then.

362
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,575
Why can't the bicycle
stand on its own?

363
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,076
No, no. It can.

364
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,619
It's got a kickstand.

365
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,414
'Cause it was too tired.

366
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,043
Yeah.

367
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,046
Oh, I'm actually
getting rid of the bike,

368
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,089
so if you want it,
you can have it.

369
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,591
I got a motorcycle.

370
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,384
- Oh, a motorcycle?
- Yeah.

371
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,636
Teach me to ride it?

372
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,306
Yeah.

373
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,600
You have shit on your back.

374
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,478
I'll get it.

375
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,275
We should go out sometime
and do something.

376
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,527
- With me?
- With both of us.

377
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,945
I mean,
we'd both have to be there.

378
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,448
Otherwise, it wouldn't be
a very good time.

379
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,869
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

380
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,081
Uh, I'm gonna be late
for dinner.

381
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,336
But, uh, I appreciate the hand.

382
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,588
It feels better already.

383
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,465
So you did that on purpose.

384
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,466
What?

385
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,842
He was injured,

386
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,636
he needed medical attention,
and Dr. Mathis

387
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,054
- is the best in town.
- Do you believe her?

388
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,764
Do not believe a word she says.

389
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,391
- You know, she's a strategist.
- Fine, fine, fine.

390
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,642
She's just trying to play Cupid.

391
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:36,559
Thought he was cute.
Seemed nice.

392
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,602
Are you gonna call him

393
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,645
and invite him to her party,

394
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,063
or you gonna just go alone?

395
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,731
Now pick a card. Mm-hmm.

396
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,191
Oh, no. I got the death card.

397
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,984
- No, that's not bad in tarot.
- Mm-mm.

398
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,862
No, that just means
a major phase is ending

399
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,280
and a new one is about to begin.

400
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,825
So, that pretty much puts
a nail in the coffin

401
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,993
with that police officer
you were dating.

402
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,788
Ugh, Doug.

403
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,290
You know, you need to find
someone that can let go.

404
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,292
That makes you want
to rip off your shirt

405
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,753
and show grief
your fucking tits and say,

406
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,755
"You know what? Let's go."

407
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,717
This is delicious.

408
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,177
Corey. Is it infected?

409
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,054
Is your hand infected?
What did the doctor say?

410
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,514
He said
it's gonna be fine, Mama.

411
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,974
He said that
you don't need to worry,

412
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,684
and he said it would be
terrific is what he said.

413
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,519
Well, I just might have to send
him back to the call center

414
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,188
to work for Devon if you can't
give him proper supervision.

415
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,482
I can't keep my eyes
on every second.

416
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,030
What the hell are you doing?

417
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,115
Who's that calling you
under the dinner table?

418
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,409
Uh, it's no one, Mama.

419
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,454
Who's that person
you're texting?

420
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,707
It's no one.

421
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,796
Boys who keep secrets
don't get custard for dessert.

422
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,720
Don't tell her about
the motorcycle, then.

423
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,241
Ford station wagon.

424
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,536
Hold on one second.

425
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,997
Something I can help you with?

426
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,125
Corey said I should bring it in.

427
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,884
Get on.

428
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,305
Okay, so...

429
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,767
Okay.

430
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,103
Uh, right hand, gas.
Left hand is your front...

431
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,354
Fuck. Uh, sorry.

432
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,982
Right hand is gas,
also your front brake.

433
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,610
And then left hand
is your, uh, clutch.

434
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,946
Right foot is your back brake.

435
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,282
And, uh, left foot is
the shifter thingy.

436
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,492
Simple.

437
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,703
Doesn't sound simple.

438
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,371
Yo, Corey!

439
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,498
Come give us a hand.

440
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,291
- Hey, Ron.
- Hey, Terry.

441
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,043
I'm sorry
to bother you with this shit.

442
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,254
My goddamn son drove
three miles on a fucking flat

443
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,964
'cause he doesn't know
how to change a tire

444
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,757
on a goddamn automobile.

445
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,800
Fucking genius.

446
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,594
Uh... I got it.

447
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,888
Yeah, and fucking smarten up.

448
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,852
I'm gonna go help Ronald
and then fix the rattle.

449
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,437
Your rattle. Your car's, uh...

450
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,982
I don't care about the rattle.
I came to see you.

451
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,650
We'll take care of her.

452
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,360
Just got to be
a little smarter, kid.

453
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:36,072
Three pounds of ground chuck,
right here on the top.

454
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,074
- Thank you.
- Be right back with the lean.

455
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,827
Jesus, Frank, have you ever
heard of a vegetable?

456
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,412
Well, look who it is.

457
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,833
- They're good for you.
- Well, I like to

458
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,002
mix meats and make croquettes
for the guys at the station.

459
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:52,213
Okay,
that just sounds disgusting.

460
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,092
I like your hair.

461
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,927
Thanks.

462
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,847
Thanks. I, uh...

463
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,391
I just sort of
chopped it one day.

464
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,603
It just was... It felt like time.

465
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,021
Wow.

466
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,314
Somebody else fixed it.

467
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,690
- Help.
- Yeah.

468
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,025
There goes your lean.

469
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,735
- Ah. Thank you, Travis.
- Have a good day.

470
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,612
- Okay.
- See ya.

471
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,865
But I tell you, I-I feel like
I won an extra life.

472
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,326
- Mm.
- I really do.

473
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,203
I got myself a guitar
at the pawnshop,

474
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,913
and I've been
fiddling around with that,

475
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,207
and my niece gave me
a Rosetta Stone,

476
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,001
- and now I'm learning Japanese.
- Mm.

477
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,256
- What does that mean?
- It means I lost my shirt.

478
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,717
I think. Or I lost my hat.

479
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,761
I don't know. I...

480
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,429
Uh...

481
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,681
Thanks.

482
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,058
Uh, who knows?

483
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,060
Maybe I'll fly over
for the cherry blossoms.

484
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,437
Test it out on the locals.

485
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,317
You still got your nose in
that, uh, book you're writing?

486
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,904
Your fault. It was your idea.

487
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,198
It was?

488
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,533
- No, I'm...
- Got a title?

489
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,784
Just set up my office.

490
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,369
You know, I have a house
with Allyson.

491
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,830
We're living together.
It's nice.

492
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,040
Uh...

493
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,669
You know, she's been
talking to this guy.

494
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,380
You probably know him.

495
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,589
Corey Cunningham.

496
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,009
Oh, yeah. I do know.

497
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,678
He's a good kid.
Had a tough break.

498
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,765
It's nice to know somebody's
out there looking out for him.

499
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,225
I like your face.

500
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,310
I mean, I like seeing your face.

501
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,311
So do you.

502
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,272
I mean...

503
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,066
I do, too.
I like seeing you, too.

504
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,827
Hi.

505
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,584
Hey.

506
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,960
What you smiling about?

507
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,212
What did you buy at the store?

508
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,342
- I'm sorry?
- "I'm sorry?"

509
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,428
I'm s... I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

510
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,305
Do you see what he did
to my sister?

511
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,975
He killed her husband,
and he stabbed her.

512
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,143
Took her voice!

513
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,938
She cannot speak because of you!

514
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,523
You were her neighbor,

515
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,400
and you don't even know
her name, do you?

516
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:21,196
You tempted
and you provoked that man

517
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,657
when you should've
left him alone.

518
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,372
Laurie.

519
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,505
Hey.

520
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,676
You okay?

521
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,094
Yeah.

522
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:47,222
I would like to see
those cherry blossoms.

523
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,100
And I think you'd like 'em, too.

524
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,397
Whoo!
Who knows what to believe?

525
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,816
I think the man who escaped
Smith's Grove in 1978

526
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,276
was not the same man
who killed all those people.

527
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:01,903
The real Michael Myers
was murdered that night,

528
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,364
and the heavy breather
with the mask was the same man

529
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,990
who poisoned Pope John Paul I.

530
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,844
- There you are!
- Hi.

531
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,722
I thought I missed you.

532
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:30,181
Who's under the mask?

533
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,809
Uh... I'm a scarecrow.

534
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,144
What?

535
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,396
I said I'm a scarecrow.

536
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,274
Are you supposed to be scary?

537
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,317
I'll be right there.

538
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,944
I'll be right back, okay?

539
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,738
I'm gonna get us a drink.

540
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,121
Watch it!

541
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,041
Hey, scarecrow.

542
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,667
See anything you like?

543
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,004
Hey, Lindsay.

544
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,672
- Two vodka sodas.
- Two vodka sodas.

545
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:05,008
Lindsay, guess who
Allyson's scarecrow is.

546
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,218
The guy that fucked the
old lady at the nursing home.

547
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,929
Deb, drop it.

548
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,097
I'm kidding.

549
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,099
It's actually Corey Cunningham,

550
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,768
the guy that killed that kid.

551
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,353
Don't listen to her, Allyson.

552
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:19,314
You can be with
whoever you want to be with.

553
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,066
Yeah.

554
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:22,776
And right now,

555
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,486
I'm with him.

556
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,515
Yeah!

557
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,721
Hey, man. Can I get a beer?

558
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,809
Hey.

559
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:25,398
You're just here dancing
and having a good time?

560
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,693
I'm sorry.

561
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,111
You're sorry? Oh.

562
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:33,281
Sorry?
Sorry for killing my son?

563
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,452
I wake up every day,

564
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,621
and I can't get past the pain.

565
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,916
It kills me. Do you understand?

566
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,417
You think you can come here...

567
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,252
No, you don't understand
if you think you can come here

568
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,629
and take off your little mask

569
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,631
and have a good time
with your friends.

570
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,425
A judge might have said you're
innocent, but I know you.

571
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,094
I know it was no accident.

572
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,428
It was no accident!

573
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,556
You pushed my little boy
because you got mad,

574
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,434
and you lost your fucking mind!

575
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,145
Innocent people don't do that!
No!

576
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,649
Evil people do.

577
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,067
Evil.

578
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,447
Corey!

579
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,575
Corey, watch out! Corey!

580
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:20,995
Corey!

581
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,455
- Stop. Talk to me.
- Why'd you take me in there?

582
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,207
It's why I don't go out.

583
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,334
- What?
- You just, you...

584
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,169
you threw me in the middle
of it, and then you...

585
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,463
Where were you?

586
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,757
I didn't know
what was happening in there.

587
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,218
I-I was just trying, I was just
trying to help you to just...

588
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,386
I'm not your fucking project,
Allyson!

589
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,264
I just... Corey, I know!

590
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,475
Okay?
I know what it's like to have

591
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,477
everybody looking at you,
thinking that they know you,

592
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,271
thinking that they know
what you've been through,

593
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,605
but they don't.

594
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:52,944
But when I look at you...
When I saw you the other day,

595
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,487
I just saw a person.

596
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:57,949
Just a person just trying
to figure it the fuck out.

597
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,327
Trying to wake up every day
not scared and alone.

598
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,415
But the difference, Allyson,
between me and you

599
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,917
is that people look at me like,

600
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,253
"Who is this guy?
Who is this monster?"

601
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,423
And they look at you like...
They see you like a survivor.

602
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:14,841
What are you talking about?

603
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,594
I get it.
You survived Michael Myers.

604
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,180
You're a hero with
your struggles, and ask anyone.

605
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,974
I'm the psycho babysitter.
I'm the fucking kid killer.

606
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,604
And you think you can fix me,
but you can't.

607
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,857
I'll spare you the heartache.

608
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,421
Corey!

609
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,884
Hey, cool kid. What's up?

610
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,511
Where you going?

611
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,930
There you are, man.
I've been looking for you.

612
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,391
- Terry.
- I want to apologize, okay?

613
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,725
Ugh, Jesus Christ.

614
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,769
So what do you say, Corey? Huh?

615
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:10,939
How about this?
Handshakes and friendship.

616
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,027
Don't leave him hanging, dude.

617
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,953
What is your problem
with this kid?

618
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,082
- This guy fucked up the LeBaron.
- Hell yeah.

619
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,126
Dollar store designer frames?

620
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,044
Oops.

621
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,796
Hey, let me
help you up. Come on.

622
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,758
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

623
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,218
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Get the fuck back!

624
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,428
- Hey! Hey!
- Get back!

625
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,762
- Get back!
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

626
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,514
- I'm just trying to help.
- Get back!

627
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,307
You gonna murder us?
Same way you killed that kid?

628
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,351
You little psycho bitch.

629
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,936
You don't know
what you're talking about!

630
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,813
You don't know what you're talking about.

631
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,440
You just act like
a goddamn asshole

632
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:54,941
because your father
treats you like one.

633
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,944
It's contagious, right?

634
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,195
Shit.

635
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:00,780
- What did you just say to me?
- That's right.

636
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,782
I know what it looks like
when somebody hates you.

637
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,909
And your father
fucking hates you.

638
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,245
Hmm? He hates me?

639
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,621
- Billy.
- He hates me, huh?

640
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:09,706
- He hates me, right?
- Hey!

641
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,624
Billy, knock it off. Billy!

642
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,001
He hates me?

643
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,753
Terry, what the fuck?!

644
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,921
Oh, shit!

645
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,007
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

646
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,842
- Oh, shit.
- Terry, what did you do?!

647
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,136
- He fell.
- Little dick busted it.

648
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:24,971
- Is he dead?
- Go down and look.

649
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,140
- No, you go down and look.
- What the fuck?

650
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:29,517
I didn't push nobody. He fell.

651
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,602
- Bullshit.
- He fell?

652
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,145
Yeah, that's my story.

653
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,147
Let's get out of here.

654
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,441
Who's the psycho now,
Terry? Who's the psycho?

655
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,650
Little prick deserved it.

656
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:38,985
Get in the car, Margo.

657
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,278
We killed a kid, man.

658
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,988
Come on.

659
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,856
Hey, what's happening?

660
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,108
Just... I can't get
this fucking thing to turn on.

661
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,776
Okay, okay. Take a breath.

662
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:20,694
- Okay, take a deep breath.
- Just let me be mad!

663
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,696
Why can't I be mad?!

664
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,447
You can.

665
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,032
You can be mad.

666
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,742
You can be very, very mad,

667
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,369
And you can smash things.

668
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,371
Just be careful.
It's addictive.

669
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,300
You were right.

670
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:45,593
I liked him.

671
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,387
Yeah.

672
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,817
You see that man in there?

673
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,738
He take people in there
now and then.

674
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,742
Why'd he let you live?

675
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:15,994
I say you go back.

676
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:19,205
You go back in there,
and you get me that mask.

677
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,499
I'm Michael Myers.

678
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,960
The fuck?

679
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:27,589
He not done with you,
you little fuck.

680
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,668
Hey!

681
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,961
Where have you been?

682
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,131
I have been worried sick!

683
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:14,094
Corey, I almost called
the missing persons.

684
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:15,970
What is going on with you?

685
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:18,306
Corey, I'm talking to you.

686
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,142
She's no good, damn it.

687
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,727
Open the door.

688
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,689
Open the door!

689
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,108
Are you trying to kill me?

690
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,444
Corey? Corey?

691
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,671
No hard feelings
about the promotion, right?

692
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,131
Course not. You deserve it.

693
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,008
I thought for sure Dr. Mathis

694
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,968
was gonna make you
the charge nurse.

695
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,762
Deb, can I speak to you
a minute?

696
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,145
Okay, Deb, I'm gonna
tell you once...

697
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,739
People create their own stories

698
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,824
and make their own choices.

699
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,619
They believe
what they want to believe.

700
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:24,164
I'm hopeful, with perspective,

701
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:27,208
that my experience
will help others heal.

702
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,797
You have to ask yourself,
"Am I in control,

703
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,342
"or do the elements control me?

704
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,093
"Life or death.

705
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:41,431
Suicide or cherry blossoms."

706
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,091
Hi.

707
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,509
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

708
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,135
I'm just waiting for Allyson.

709
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,472
Corey?

710
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,269
Everything okay?

711
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:32,607
Uh, I got jumped
on the way home last night.

712
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,859
These guys...

713
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:41,241
Those kids from the gas station
that were messing with me...

714
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:44,285
I tried to stand up for myself,
and they, um...

715
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,289
Oh, I'm sorry.

716
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:53,962
I just came 'cause
I wanted to talk to you.

717
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,214
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
and there's...

718
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,465
no excuse.

719
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,592
But if you could, please,
if you could just

720
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:01,678
take a walk with me.

721
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,805
Please?

722
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,993
I killed someone.

723
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,000
We were making paper planes,

724
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,836
but he wanted to watch
a monster movie.

725
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,633
Everything happened so fast.

726
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:28,390
I just wanted it
to be a fun night.

727
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,937
That's all, just...
a good night.

728
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,444
And then it all went bad.

729
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,617
I heard what happened.

730
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,246
I know it sounds crazy,
but when...

731
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,958
people would talk about it,
it was like I knew you.

732
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,336
Like I was looking for you.

733
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:00,588
And then she brought you to me.

734
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,015
Has he done something bad?

735
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,474
I don't understand
why you're here.

736
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:14,269
No, no. He's seeing
my granddaughter.

737
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,062
I introduced them, actually.

738
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:17,897
Your granddaughter
should be so lucky

739
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:19,733
as to be with a boy like Corey.

740
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,027
He's handsome. He's sensitive.

741
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,070
I don't like it
when he stays out

742
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,948
all night with girls,
but he's grown.

743
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,284
He can do what he wants.

744
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,079
Yes.

745
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,585
I know he's had
his difficulties.

746
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,795
My son.

747
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,213
This town turned against him

748
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:43,923
after the accident
with Jeremy Allen.

749
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:45,342
They would've felt for him.

750
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:46,718
They would've helped him heal.

751
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,596
But because your boogeyman
disappeared,

752
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:51,639
they needed a new one.

753
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,645
I'm sorry.

754
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,691
After my mom
and dad were killed,

755
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,943
I just wanted
to burn it all to the ground

756
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:06,446
- and get away from Haddonfield.
- Why not leave?

757
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,114
Why stay?

758
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,617
All my memories are here.

759
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,162
I think both your parents
got killed

760
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,955
and your grandma
feels guilty about it,

761
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,415
so she's making you her child.

762
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,626
If you could've seen her
before therapy,

763
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,628
sobering up, and me...

764
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,380
I'm just terrified to think
what would happen

765
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:25,131
if she were all alone if I left.

766
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:27,050
So, what, you got to stay here,
protect her

767
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,635
from herself forever?

768
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,598
Look...

769
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,017
I'm sorry I lost my head
at the party

770
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,144
and I walked away.

771
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,105
That was a mistake.

772
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,525
When I look at you, I...

773
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:48,154
I know I can tell you the truth.

774
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,323
I'm not afraid of these people.

775
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:52,492
I'm not afraid anymore.

776
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,662
You tell me that you want
to burn it down,

777
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,580
or you tell me you want
to burn it to the ground.

778
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,834
Hey. Twice in one week.

779
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,503
Pretty cool. Hot diggity.

780
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,005
Hey, you said you, uh...
you were gonna call.

781
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:06,923
You were... you were gonna call,
but you didn't call.

782
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,092
No, I owe you a call.

783
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,302
Did I... did I do
something wrong or...

784
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:12,721
I'm with someone.

785
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:14,389
Oh. Oh.

786
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,391
Oops. Uh, sorry for that.

787
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:17,976
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

788
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,270
Well, um, you know, it's, uh...
it's Joe Grillo's, uh...

789
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:21,980
Hey, Joe! Hey.

790
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,690
Joe Grillo's birthday today.

791
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,608
And Joe Ross, uh,
he made a sponge cake.

792
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,736
You two want to stop by,
get a slice

793
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:30,113
- after whatever you guys are doing?
- We're good.

794
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,948
Oh. Okay, you're good.

795
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,241
Let me tell you, it's, uh...

796
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:34,868
If you change your mind,
there's...

797
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,536
She said we're good!

798
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:43,168
Hey, buddy, you got a problem?

799
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,087
We're good.

800
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,549
Oh, shit.

801
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,426
Allyson.

802
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:54,929
So you call
Mr. Aggravated Manslaughter

803
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:56,806
at night when you can't sleep?

804
00:50:56,848 --> 00:50:58,266
Hmm?

805
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:01,311
When you see the Boogeyman
in your nightmares?

806
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,646
You feel safe with this guy?

807
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,203
Hey, man.

808
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:20,705
Messing around.

809
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,457
Allyson.

810
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,085
Nah, nah, nah.

811
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:26,586
- Psycho.
- You good, Mulaney?

812
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,421
It's all good. It's all good.

813
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,298
We need to go kick
somebody's ass?

814
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,717
No, no. I got this.

815
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,308
Just burn it all to the ground.

816
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:43,103
I'll light the match.

817
00:52:16,928 --> 00:52:18,680
Do you want to come in?

818
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:23,226
Another night.

819
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:20,301
Ah, fuck!

820
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,242
Hey!

821
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,661
You don't fuck
with Doug Mulaney!

822
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,723
Where are you? Huh?

823
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:10,060
You say it was an accident.

824
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,063
But I know what you did.

825
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:21,571
I'm gonna fuck your face up,
you little shit.

826
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:33,500
The fuck is that?

827
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,571
Help.

828
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:06,032
Show me how to do it.

829
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,327
Get up, get up, get up.

830
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,037
Get up!

831
00:57:36,414 --> 00:57:38,083
Who is it?

832
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:40,001
It's me.

833
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,587
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

834
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,839
I don't know
what's happening to me.

835
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,137
What's going on?

836
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,060
Look at me.

837
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:04,317
Who did this to you?

838
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,111
Hey.

839
00:58:07,195 --> 00:58:08,655
Look at me.

840
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:11,116
Did Michael Myers let you live?

841
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,034
Or did you escape?

842
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:24,963
Does it hurt?

843
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,717
No. No.

844
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,638
My mother saved me.

845
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:24,898
You're fucking him, aren't you?

846
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:27,901
It's, like, the perfect story
of Haddonfield in a way.

847
00:59:27,942 --> 00:59:29,903
Cute young girl falls
for local creep.

848
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:31,279
Imagine if your grandmother had

849
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:33,281
fallen in love
with Michael Myers.

850
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,866
But she didn't.
I heard she stabbed him

851
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,409
in the neck with
a fucking knitting needle.

852
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:37,744
What's your problem, Deb?

853
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:39,204
You talk to me
like I'm not even here.

854
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:41,623
Do you ever just shut
your goddamn mouth?

855
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:43,750
I know, right?

856
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,418
I know I talk too much.

857
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,630
I just get so excited about
all that Boogeyman bullshit.

858
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:52,092
Uh-uh. No.
I-I'm vetoing that trade.

859
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:54,594
Your second receiver
for Mark's last-place defense

860
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,096
reeks of collusion.

861
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:58,515
It's not a straight-up swap.

862
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:00,517
You want to win
the championship with class?

863
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:01,976
Stop cheating.

864
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,854
Stop cheating.

865
01:00:05,438 --> 01:00:07,732
I keep seeing his eyes.

866
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:09,609
Are we talking about Michael
or this kid?

867
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,696
Michael's eyes in Corey.

868
01:00:12,737 --> 01:00:16,658
Lindsay, I was so sure.

869
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:19,869
Just like the first time.

870
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:21,663
Hey, Roger.

871
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:25,917
There's someone
I want you to meet.

872
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,628
I always liked Corey.

873
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,297
You know, some kids, you can
tell they're a pain in the ass,

874
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:33,008
but Corey was a good kid.

875
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,093
And I just couldn't imagine
he'd be capable

876
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:37,345
of hurting anyone on purpose.

877
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:38,847
But with the trial, I...

878
01:00:38,888 --> 01:00:42,434
just started spinning
with theories, and...

879
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:43,852
and eventually I thought,

880
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:45,311
"Give it up.
You're never gonna get closure.

881
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:46,896
There's no such thing."

882
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:49,983
A couple of years go by, and
I'd see him every now and then,

883
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,901
see the way people avoided him

884
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,279
or how they made faces
behind his back,

885
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,489
which, if I'm honest,
pissed me off.

886
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:59,743
Because I felt like
they took my pain...

887
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:03,955
...my despair,

888
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,999
and they made it about them.

889
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,711
And then, yesterday,
I'm on my way to work.

890
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,212
There he is.

891
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:14,674
And I think,
"I'm gonna say something,

892
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:16,092
"prove my wife wrong.

893
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:19,471
Let's find a way
to forgive this kid."

894
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:24,601
And I pull up next to him,
and he looks at me,

895
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,062
and it's not him.

896
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,190
At least not in the eyes.

897
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:33,902
And I don't know, man.

898
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:37,030
The hairs on the back
of my neck stood up.

899
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,535
Right then, I felt like
I got my answer.

900
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:46,748
The kid who used to mow
our lawn didn't kill my son.

901
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,416
I know that.

902
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,753
But the guy I saw
on the side of the road

903
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,464
was down a dark path.

904
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:57,926
Did the town do this to him
after the accident?

905
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:00,261
Or was it always there?

906
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:07,060
You're just
laughing at all my jokes,

907
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:09,646
aren't you?

908
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,731
Oh, my God.

909
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,067
All right, Alexa.

910
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:17,237
Play "Tell Me With Your Eyes"
by Rob Galbraith.

911
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:18,697
Here's
"Tell Me With Your Eyes..."

912
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:21,574
This house is so...

913
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:22,867
rich.

914
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:30,583
Baby, I have been waiting
all day for this.

915
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:34,337
I've been saving this bottle
of Au Bon Climat.

916
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:36,965
You looked so fucking hot
at the office today.

917
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:39,467
Hmm.

918
01:02:39,509 --> 01:02:40,635
Mind if I...

919
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,470
Bedroom's down the hall.

920
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:44,055
Clean up. Take a shower.

921
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,516
In fact, I'll meet you in there.

922
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:50,562
Yes, yes.

923
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,316
Mm-hmm.

924
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:57,318
Yes.

925
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:27,057
Holy shit.

926
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,184
Is there a doctor in the house?

927
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:35,190
Yeah, baby. All right.

928
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:36,858
Got the cheese.
We got the crackers.

929
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,068
We're ready.

930
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,033
Dr. Mathis?

931
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:50,914
Dr. Mathis?

932
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:57,253
Dr. Mathis?

933
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,310
Dr. Mathis?

934
01:04:54,602 --> 01:04:58,064
Please, please, please, please.
Please, please, please, please.

935
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:06,865
911...

936
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,466
After the accident,

937
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:51,594
I'd ride my bike over here
and I'd sit up on this roof.

938
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:56,182
And I'd look up at that tower.

939
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:58,226
Wonder if I could climb
to the top.

940
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:01,521
It was summoning me.

941
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:05,775
Like a watchtower or beacon
calling me to live my old life.

942
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,068
To be happy again.

943
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:13,742
I have something like that, too.

944
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:17,579
It always gave me hope,
you know, things would...

945
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,497
Well, maybe somehow
things would go back

946
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,666
to the way they used to be.

947
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:25,754
Before everything changed.

948
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:31,092
Infected.

949
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:35,180
I got to get away from
everybody who knows me.

950
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:38,725
But I don't, I...

951
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:41,811
I don't want to go alone.

952
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:50,153
Corey, come on.

953
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,863
Stop.

954
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:54,157
I think you're scared that
you don't have enough bandages

955
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:55,992
to keep me together.

956
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,118
Corey, what are you...?!

957
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:04,209
Are you okay?

958
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,543
What, are you insane?

959
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,379
What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

960
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,464
I'm not interested
in immortality.

961
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,432
The hell is going on out here?

962
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:21,393
Yo, this is private property.

963
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:23,895
Not safe to be doing
whatever the hell you do...

964
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:27,232
Corey Cunningham.

965
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,775
What you doing out here,
you ugly motherfucker?

966
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:31,069
- Corey, stop it.
- You gonna scare all the kids.

967
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:32,445
You stop.

968
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:36,324
I don't know
who the fuck you talking to,

969
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:39,828
but, uh, I know who you are.

970
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:42,789
Yeah, I know
the Laurie Strode story.

971
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,168
She teased a man with brain
damage, and then he snapped.

972
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,712
Look at you.

973
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:50,797
You gonna make a little name
for yourself now, huh?

974
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,091
Walking around with
this dumb bitch right here.

975
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:54,300
You never shut up.

976
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:55,427
Hear his voice everywhere.

977
01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:57,429
Oh, you're goddamn right you do.

978
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,972
And once Willie get in your ear,

979
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:02,642
it's like your favorite song
stuck in your head.

980
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,231
Y'all get the hell
up off my property

981
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,691
before I fuck y'all up.

982
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,154
All right.

983
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:16,656
You're right.

984
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:19,284
Let's do it.

985
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,995
I don't want to be
in Haddonfield anymore.

986
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:23,997
I want to be with you.

987
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,600
I can smell her on you.

988
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:46,311
She's trying to take you
away from me, isn't she?

989
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,021
That's where you go every night.

990
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:50,774
Well, I say go.

991
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,903
You go right now!

992
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,988
Get out of my house!

993
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:01,785
Oh, no. No.

994
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:13,421
I hope you find love.

995
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,361
Allyson?

996
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:45,954
It's nice to see you.

997
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:57,757
You know,
there are two kinds of evil.

998
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,595
There's the evil that exists
as an external force

999
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:05,473
that threatens the well-being
of the tribe.

1000
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:10,979
Survival depends on
understanding and awareness

1001
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:15,567
and fear of physical threat
to our daily lives.

1002
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:18,653
The other kind of evil
lives inside us.

1003
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:23,491
Like a sickness or an infection.

1004
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:29,539
It's more dangerous because
we may not know we're infected.

1005
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:37,922
Am I a bad person?

1006
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:41,926
Are you?

1007
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:43,511
Well...

1008
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:47,474
...we're both fucked-up.

1009
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:51,853
I want to help you, Corey.

1010
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:53,146
Let me help you.

1011
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,315
Or let me find help for you.

1012
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:56,858
You can't have her.

1013
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,819
Allyson is not equipped
for this relationship,

1014
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:02,113
and I will not let her get hurt.

1015
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:04,074
So stay the fuck away...

1016
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,950
You started this!

1017
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:08,870
You brought me in!
You invited me!

1018
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:13,375
But you're the one to blame.

1019
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,879
"You want to do it,
or you want me to?"

1020
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,388
If I can't have her...

1021
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,891
...no one will.

1022
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:35,480
You want to help Allyson?
Let her live her life.

1023
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:40,568
She has me now.

1024
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,494
You should give in.

1025
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,540
You should surrender
to that feeling you had

1026
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,084
the first time
you ever looked into his eyes.

1027
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,633
You secretly hope
Michael comes back for you.

1028
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,099
I'm the psycho.

1029
01:13:12,183 --> 01:13:14,436
You're the freak show.

1030
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,640
What's wrong?

1031
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:53,767
We need to leave.

1032
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:56,603
I can't right now. I'm working.

1033
01:13:56,644 --> 01:13:58,772
Tonight, then.

1034
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:02,609
Will you meet me at 9:00?

1035
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:04,903
At the diner off 74.

1036
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,155
We need to talk about
your grandmother.

1037
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,117
She wants to kill me.

1038
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,078
- What?
- Yeah.

1039
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,121
I can't take it anymore.

1040
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:17,916
It's time to say goodbye
to Haddonfield.

1041
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,800
You got something I need.

1042
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:53,868
You're just a man
in a Halloween mask.

1043
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:55,662
What are you gonna do now?

1044
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,603
Call him after.

1045
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:21,896
I don't want
to go to your house, man.

1046
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:23,273
Your dad always
fucking yells at us.

1047
01:15:23,314 --> 01:15:24,733
Too fucking bad.
You should've got your own.

1048
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:26,359
Shouldn't have
any of these anyway.

1049
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,028
Why can't we go to her house?
She's the one that's rich.

1050
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:29,195
- Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot.
- What the fuck?

1051
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:31,031
What?

1052
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:36,119
He's dead! Get in!

1053
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,579
Oh, shit. Shit.

1054
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:54,262
Did you find
what you're looking for?

1055
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:56,598
I imagine you're going
on a wonderful trip.

1056
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,477
- Were you gonna tell me?
- What difference does it make?

1057
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:01,895
It makes a big difference,
Allyson.

1058
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,731
I feel he is capable
of real harm.

1059
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,983
Is that what bothers you?

1060
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,904
Is it suspicion or paranoia?

1061
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:12,906
Intuition? An inkling?

1062
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:14,157
You got an inkling?

1063
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,618
I went to his home.
I met his mother.

1064
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,912
I know. He told me.

1065
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:21,581
So, you're what?
You're stalking him now?

1066
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,166
- No.
- And you're threatening him.

1067
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:25,627
- What did you say to him?
- I-I see the same thing in him

1068
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,921
- that I saw in Michael.
- Michael.

1069
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:29,673
Michael Myers is who you are.

1070
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:31,549
You're not listening to me,
Allyson.

1071
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:32,926
I am trying to protect you.

1072
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,427
I don't want your protection!

1073
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:38,556
But you-you can have
a good life, Allyson.

1074
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:39,891
A good life.

1075
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,685
Just not with him.

1076
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:44,771
You pretend like you moved on,
but it's bullshit.

1077
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,481
You're actually just obsessed
with death,

1078
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:47,899
like it's some sort of game.

1079
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:49,609
And you're not gonna rest
until you've finished it

1080
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,237
or until everybody else is as
fucking miserable as you are!

1081
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,948
I need to get out of here
before this town kills

1082
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:57,826
the one person that actually
makes me feel something.

1083
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,955
He is on a dark path!

1084
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:03,623
I'm not gonna
let this happen to you!

1085
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,166
You have to believe me!

1086
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:07,919
Believe you?

1087
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,963
You want me to believe you?

1088
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,091
Because of the hysteria
that you caused

1089
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,761
when I trusted you,
my friends are dead.

1090
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:18,304
My parents are dead.

1091
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:22,267
You're the one
that's capable of fucking harm!

1092
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,406
You sure
he turned in here, dude?

1093
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:38,033
Yeah, it's like
his hideout or something.

1094
01:17:38,074 --> 01:17:39,492
It's where he works.

1095
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:42,120
- His work is a dump.
- It actually is a dump.

1096
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:43,955
Okay, no,
but seriously, where is he?

1097
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,290
- There's the bike.
- Shit, dude, pull over.

1098
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:47,917
This is gonna be so crazy.

1099
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,837
- Let's go.
- Billy, can you hurry up?

1100
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,464
- Corey!
- You're squishing me.

1101
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,174
- God.
- Where'd he go?

1102
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,383
Come out, Corey!

1103
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,262
Corey, I just want to kiss
and make up, my man!

1104
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:00,930
- Come on!
- Stop being a punk!

1105
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:02,849
- Corey!
- Where you at, man?

1106
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,101
I'll show you what happens when
you mess with my dad's car!

1107
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:06,978
Can we hurry this up, man?

1108
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,524
Oh, I got an idea.

1109
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:14,152
Billy, back the car up.

1110
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:15,111
Bet.

1111
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:16,529
Grab that chain. Let's go.

1112
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:19,366
Terry, there's somebody
in the office.

1113
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:20,867
Stop being a chickenshit.

1114
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,452
Run it through the wheel.
All right?

1115
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,454
We're gonna tie it
to the back of the car,

1116
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,498
and then we'll drag it
till there's nothing left.

1117
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,084
Dusty-ass bike.

1118
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,003
Shit.

1119
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:34,756
- Let's go, Billy. Billy!
- Come on, Terry. Hurry up, man.

1120
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,758
- Someone's here.
- Billy!

1121
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:41,096
Come on, Billy!
Let's get this punk!

1122
01:18:41,137 --> 01:18:42,055
Let's go!

1123
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:43,723
Oh, my God. Billy.

1124
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:46,226
Billy, what are you trying
to do, man? Suck your own...

1125
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:47,811
Oh, my God!

1126
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:48,978
What the fuck?!

1127
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,855
Terry?

1128
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:52,774
What's wrong?

1129
01:18:52,816 --> 01:18:54,109
Billy's dead!

1130
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:55,527
- What?
- What?!

1131
01:18:55,568 --> 01:18:56,986
What are you talking about?!

1132
01:18:57,028 --> 01:18:59,739
Oh, shit.

1133
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:02,450
Stacy? Stacy?

1134
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:04,577
What... what's happening?!

1135
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:12,419
Damn it!

1136
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,756
Stacy!

1137
01:19:41,656 --> 01:19:42,949
Help, help, help, help!

1138
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:45,952
Help! You got to help me!
Help me!

1139
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,871
Margo!

1140
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:49,247
Oh, my God!

1141
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:52,000
Margo! Margo!

1142
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,585
Speak to me.

1143
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:56,254
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1144
01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:59,799
Stay calm.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1145
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,343
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out.

1146
01:20:01,384 --> 01:20:03,011
Try to be calm.

1147
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,307
It's loaded.

1148
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:09,184
Stay here.

1149
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:27,494
I don't want to die.

1150
01:20:27,535 --> 01:20:29,954
- Help me! Help me!
- Hey, hey!

1151
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:31,956
Hold on. Hold on. Hold still.

1152
01:20:31,998 --> 01:20:33,750
Hold still!
I'll get it off you.

1153
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,878
There he is!

1154
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:39,547
Corey?

1155
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,883
I got you!

1156
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:45,512
- I got you, you fucking psycho!
- No, don't!

1157
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:56,356
Stacy. Stacy.

1158
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:58,066
God.

1159
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:00,110
Oh, my God.

1160
01:21:01,903 --> 01:21:03,321
- Terry.
- Margo!

1161
01:21:03,363 --> 01:21:04,447
Terry.

1162
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:06,741
God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1163
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:08,034
Where's Stacy?

1164
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:10,245
Stacy's dead.

1165
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:12,831
You're dead, too.

1166
01:21:12,872 --> 01:21:14,708
- What?
- Terry!

1167
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,393
No.

1168
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:35,562
Oh, shit.

1169
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:48,116
It's the zest of a lemon peel.

1170
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,118
Gives a little fresh twist.

1171
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,328
So the blueberries, obviously,
are really hot.

1172
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,830
And then when it's
all ready to go,

1173
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:55,749
we'll go and freeze the custard
and then whip...

1174
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:57,250
Ronald?

1175
01:21:58,001 --> 01:21:59,294
Ronald?

1176
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:03,131
I have laundry.

1177
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,926
I can put it in your dresser,

1178
01:22:06,968 --> 01:22:08,636
or I can leave it
in this basket here.

1179
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:10,597
...this container
and put it in the freezer

1180
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:12,640
for about, oh,
half an hour to an hour

1181
01:22:12,682 --> 01:22:13,975
so it'll firm up.

1182
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:15,477
Now we're gonna eat it.

1183
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:17,270
That looks good.

1184
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:19,064
A little ice cream,
a little cookie...

1185
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:23,777
Ooh, the hotline is open,
and we are taking requests.

1186
01:22:23,818 --> 01:22:26,071
Songs for the resurrection.

1187
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:28,114
What's gonna get
our monster out?

1188
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:29,824
Give us something
to scream about?

1189
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:32,452
Caller, you're on the air.

1190
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:34,204
Willie, you should be

1191
01:22:34,245 --> 01:22:36,414
ashamed of yourself
exploiting these tragedies.

1192
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:39,709
There are three missing people
right now in Haddonfield.

1193
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:42,587
"Beware," sir,
"that when fighting monsters,

1194
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:45,090
"you yourself do not
become a monster,

1195
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:47,801
"for when you gaze long
into the abyss,

1196
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:50,261
the abyss gazes also into you."

1197
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:54,265
Nietzsche also said,
"Without music..."

1198
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:58,395
"...life would be a mistake."

1199
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:14,828
Can I help you?

1200
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:32,929
Hey, man, who the hell are you?

1201
01:23:32,971 --> 01:23:34,389
Hey, what the f... Oh!

1202
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:49,881
Allyson, I'm sorry.

1203
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:52,092
I'm sorry for what I said.

1204
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:54,511
I'm sorry. Please.

1205
01:24:54,552 --> 01:24:56,763
And I just want you
to come home.

1206
01:27:18,822 --> 01:27:20,782
- 911.
- Yes.

1207
01:27:20,824 --> 01:27:24,119
I would like to report
a suicide.

1208
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:28,415
1206 Mill's End Road.

1209
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:21,885
Did you really think
I'd kill myself?

1210
01:28:41,696 --> 01:28:44,491
I have tried so hard...

1211
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:48,620
...to have compassion
and find mercy.

1212
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:54,542
But what's the point?

1213
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:06,137
You came here to kill me,
so do it.

1214
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:33,164
You know, we all learn the truth

1215
01:29:33,206 --> 01:29:34,916
about each other eventually.

1216
01:29:38,169 --> 01:29:40,463
Did you really think

1217
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:44,759
that Allyson
was gonna be with you?

1218
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:48,096
If I can't have her...

1219
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:52,767
You son of a bitch.

1220
01:30:11,703 --> 01:30:13,747
What did you do?

1221
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:15,749
What did you do to him?

1222
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:17,625
No, no.

1223
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:24,758
No. No.

1224
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:27,927
Why did you do this?

1225
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:30,513
- No.
- Corey, come back. Come back.

1226
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:34,476
No, no.

1227
01:30:40,523 --> 01:30:42,150
You!

1228
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:54,407
Allyson, where's Laurie?

1229
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:57,619
We're responding to a call.
She called in a suicide.

1230
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:43,600
No!

1231
01:37:02,822 --> 01:37:05,033
I've run from you.

1232
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:08,370
I have chased you.

1233
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:13,208
I have tried to contain you.

1234
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:18,380
I have tried to forgive you.

1235
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:27,305
I thought maybe
you were the Boogeyman.

1236
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:29,099
No.

1237
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:33,603
You're just a man
who's about to stop breathing.

1238
01:37:57,002 --> 01:37:58,545
Do it.

1239
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:00,880
Do it!

1240
01:38:12,934 --> 01:38:13,977
Do it.

1241
01:38:16,062 --> 01:38:18,064
No!

1242
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:26,614
I'm not gonna let this
happen to you.

1243
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:51,222
It's okay.

1244
01:39:08,323 --> 01:39:10,492
Get out of the way. Stay here.

1245
01:39:10,533 --> 01:39:12,202
Just stay back.

1246
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:15,663
Laurie!

1247
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:48,446
Michael.

1248
01:39:49,197 --> 01:39:51,324
He's dead.

1249
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:55,787
Not dead enough.

1250
01:39:56,621 --> 01:39:58,498
This isn't how we do it.

1251
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:01,167
- You're all crazy.
- What are you doing?

1252
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:02,585
Where are you taking him?

1253
01:40:02,627 --> 01:40:04,754
Time for Haddonfield
to start healing.

1254
01:40:04,796 --> 01:40:07,340
Let's show them all.

1255
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,263
This is not how it works.

1256
01:40:14,055 --> 01:40:15,849
It is tonight.

1257
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:17,851
Uh, stronger on radio silence.

1258
01:40:17,892 --> 01:40:19,144
That's got to be a command.

1259
01:40:19,185 --> 01:40:20,854
- Copy that.
- Copy.

1260
01:40:20,895 --> 01:40:23,857
Let's go.

1261
01:42:50,712 --> 01:42:52,672
The body of Michael Myers

1262
01:42:52,714 --> 01:42:55,008
was disposed of
in a midnight procession.

1263
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:58,261
There would be no tombstone,
no memorial.

1264
01:42:58,303 --> 01:43:00,764
The mysteries were put to bed,

1265
01:43:00,805 --> 01:43:04,476
and the story as we told it
was to fade with time.

1266
01:43:08,646 --> 01:43:11,649
You were right about Corey.

1267
01:43:13,234 --> 01:43:15,779
I know he killed those people.

1268
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:22,702
He was consumed by evil.

1269
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,709
The events of Haddonfield

1270
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:32,545
that created so much violence
and bloodshed

1271
01:43:32,587 --> 01:43:34,964
finally had resolve.

1272
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:43,556
Reports now confirm
that Michael Myers

1273
01:43:43,598 --> 01:43:47,268
has indeed been killed dead
after an attempted assault

1274
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:49,896
of Haddonfield resident
Laurie Strode.

1275
01:43:49,938 --> 01:43:52,899
What an incredible story
of survival

1276
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:55,193
through decades of disturbances
in our local community.

1277
01:43:55,235 --> 01:43:56,611
Finally...

1278
01:44:02,992 --> 01:44:05,787
New beginnings lay ahead.

1279
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:08,748
Fear moves through all of us,

1280
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:11,459
and we decide when to surrender.

1281
01:44:12,585 --> 01:44:15,922
I've said goodbye
to my boogeyman,

1282
01:44:15,964 --> 01:44:18,758
but the truth is
evil doesn't die.

1283
01:44:19,634 --> 01:44:21,720
It changes shape.

1284
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:43,491
I wanted you to know
I was thinking about you.

1285
01:44:43,533 --> 01:44:45,702
I want to thank you
for what you did.

1286
01:44:48,455 --> 01:44:50,373
Enjoy.

1287
01:45:01,801 --> 01:45:05,513
What was it you were saying
about those cherry blossoms?
