1
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:41,412
               Stop Right There!

2
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,748
   Stop Right There
   And Surrender Your Weapon.

3
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:47,417
    Now You'll See--

4
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:19,883
        [Groans]

5
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:39,619
 <I>[People Chattering]</I>

6
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:53,032
Ladies And Gentlemen,
That Concludes The Film Portion
Of Our Presentation.

7
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,401
                I'm Sure You All
                Have Questions.

8
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:57,771
   So Let Me Introduce You
   To The Head Of Development

9
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:00,057
       For Secure-Tronics
       Unlimited--

10
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:02,009
        Dr. Stan Simon.

11
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,897
      Thank You Very Much.

12
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:12,168
 Before I Open The Floor,
 I'd Like You All To Meet
 Your Brand-New Security Team--

13
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:15,338
 <I>The Protector 101</I>
 <I>Series Robots.</I>

14
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:17,374
One Week From Tonight
At Closing,

15
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,277
 <I>The Protectors Will Begin</I>
 <I>Their Patrol Of The Mall.</I>

16
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:23,746
            Paul, They Look Like
            The Three Stooges.

17
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:27,801
Each Assigned To One Of
The Three Upper Shopping Levels.

18
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:31,604
I Don't Know, Mary,
The One In The Middle Has
An Unpleasantly Ethnic Quality.

19
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:33,807
         Now, Are There
         Any Questions?

20
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,109
            Yes, Dr. Carrington.

21
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:40,263
So What Do Your Machines There
Do Besides Kill Criminals?

22
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:43,032
    First Of All,
    The Protectors Do Not Kill.

23
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,519
               I Wonder If They
               Kill Cockroaches.

24
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:47,654
They Could Probably
Be Programmed To.

25
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:50,523
And Merely Detain Intruders
Until The Computer,

26
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:53,810
 <I>Located On The Roof,</I>
 <I>Can Patch Into</I>
 <I>The Mall Phone System</I>

27
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:55,461
And Send The Alarm
To The Police.

28
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:58,231
I Don't Know.
That Guy Looked
Awfully Dead To Me.

29
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,801
     Just Neutralized.
     Protectors Can Achieve
     This Function

30
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:02,736
      In A Number Of Ways.

31
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:05,939
  At Close Range, Sleep Darts
  Fired From Here And Here

32
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:08,625
    Can Knock A Man Out
    In Less Than 30 Seconds.

33
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:11,478
  However, The Likelihood
  Of An Intruder Gaining Entry

34
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,813
  Is Greatly Minimized
  By The Steel Security Doors

35
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:17,417
 <I>Which Are Time-Locked</I>
 <I>From Midnight 'til Dawn.</I>

36
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:19,503
   Um, They Seem So Violent.

37
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,872
 If They're Called Protectors,
 What Do They Protect?

38
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,942
           <I>Plenty. For Starters,</I>
           <I>As Seen In The Film,</I>

39
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,112
 The Protectors Do Their Work
 In The Mall Proper,
 Not In The Stores Themselves.

40
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:32,232
 <I>Maybe We Could Use One</I>
 <I>At The Restaurant--</I>

41
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,667
Get Rid Of People
We Don't Like.

42
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:36,920
    For Instance, Lasers
    Positioned Here

43
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:39,222
    Can Cut Through
    Any Sort Of Debris.

44
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,759
Well, That's All Very Well
And Good, But What About
Those Who Work Late?

45
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:47,497
How Can Your... Things There
Distinguish Between The Good
Guys And The Bad Guys?

46
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:49,816
    That's Very Simple.

47
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:53,086
    Watch.
    This Is Simon.

48
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:56,039
    <I>Bring Number One On-Line.</I>

50
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,144
             Whoa!
                       Wow!

          [Murmuring]

52
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,239
 May I See Your
 Identification Badge, Please?

53
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,910
It's Scanning.

54
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,680
They Remind Me Of Your Mother.
It's The Laser Eyes.

55
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:22,549
 <I>[Robot]</I>
 <I>Thank You.</I>
 <I>Have A Nice Day.</I>

                 There. You See?

57
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:27,153
The System Is
Absolutely Foolproof.

58
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,206
    Now, Everyone Connected
    With The Mall Has Been
    Issued An I.D. Badge

59
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:32,408
 <I>So That When The Mechanism</I>
 <I>Goes On-Line,</I>

60
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:36,846

In The State.

 <I>Absolutely Nothing</I>
 <I>Can Go Wrong.</I>

                     Ow!

67
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:14,838

 <I>That's What I'm Afraid Of.</I>
