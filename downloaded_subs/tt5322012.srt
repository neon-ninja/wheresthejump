00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,316
Jo!

2
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,150
Mommy!

3
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,040
- Mommy!
- Clare.

4
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,839
Mommy!

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,070
How far can I go?

6
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,554
Just down the street and back.

7
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,637
- You gonna visit the nest for me?
- Yes!

8
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,030
Okay.

9
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,630
Go on, big girl.

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,870
Whee!

11
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,950
Come on, Max.

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,713
Hey, I'll keep an eye on her for you.

13
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,714
Max! Max!

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,670
I win.

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,472
Come on, back in.

16
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,556
Come on!

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,316
Come on, boy!

18
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,120
Max, come on!

19
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,630
Come on.

20
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,954
Mrs. Deluca they hatched!

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,953
That is so great sweetie!

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,996
Come on, Max!

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,190
Momma?

24
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,950
Mommy?

25
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,470
Momma?

26
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,710
Morning!

27
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,314
Aw, you look so nice.

28
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,273
- Bye!
- Bye, Mrs. Deluca.

- No, I'll get the paper.

I'm trying to drive here!

Ow!

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,950
Oh, gosh...

47
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,271
Are you alright?

48
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,510
Yeah, you know. It's...

49
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
it's Monday.

50
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,797
Here you go.

51
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,360
- Thanks
- Yeah.

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,631
See you around.

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,957
I'll check these. See if there's...

54
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,113
You've gotta be kidding me.

55
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,116
Come on!

56
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,551
Check it out.

57
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,111
Dad!

58
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,430
You serious?

59
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,637
What'd I do now?

60
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,230
You promised
that you wouldn't do this at my school.

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,030
We're not at your school.

62
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,395
We're across the street from your school.

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,551
Yeah, but people can still see you.

64
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,710
Well, who the hell's watching?

65
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,632
Yeah, her dad's a dumpster driver.

66
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,040
Hey, what happened there?

67
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,435
I fell at Uncle August's house,
he saw the whole thing.

68
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,872
What did I tell you
about talking to Uncle August?

69
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,917
You said not to. But I really don't see why.

70
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,512
Dad, you're killing me, okay?

71
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,951
Hey!

72
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,514
Come on, let's roll out, Shannon.

73
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,031
Thank you.

74
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,750

what do you guys think?

79
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,871
So good.

80
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,759
- How long it take you?
- Ah, yeah, like weeks.

81
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,672
Clare, you try way too hard, dude.

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,593
Jesus, it's better than not trying at all.

83
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,797
- Will you guys help me hang it?
- I got you.

84
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,439
Yeah, just give me one sec.

85
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,076
What is she doing?

86
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,875
It's called <i>Monster Mutant Slayer.</i>

87
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,550
Dumbest game ever.

88
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,474
Hey! Don't mock
what you don't understand dude, okay?

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,517
If I kill Lurching Louisa and Hacked-Up Harry

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,954
I level up to Mutant Killer.

91
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,513
And if I get Malformed Molly,
I'm a Monster Mutant Master, man!

92
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,080
I know. Awesome? Yes.

93
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,639
Got it.

94
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,632
- Stop!
- Sorry. Don't mind him.

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,831
My bad.

96
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,320
Seriously? Bird ass!

97
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,396
Recycle first.

98
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,676
Recycle first.

99
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,271
Hey, Clare.

100
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,870
I liked your banner.

101
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,234
Yeah, I liked it too.

102
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,955
Hey, Carl!

103
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,951
Look at this!

104
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,560
That would fetch a ton at the swap.

105
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,354
I have a better idea.

106
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
- Jesus, what's...
- It's so bad.

107
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,759
Put it away.

108
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,880
I mean she's seriously smeggy.

109
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,076
Like ultimate smeggy.

110
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,634
- I know!
- What was that?

111
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,631
Um...

112
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,391
nothing. No.

113
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,597
Um. Mm. But you were laughing.

114
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,830
Which is co-signing.

115
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,111
And we wanna know
what you were laughing about.

116
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,590
Go ahead.

117
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,111
Everyone's listening.

118
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,831
Okay.

119
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,517
Clare, come on.

120
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,080
Go Clare. Yeah, do it.

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,991
What's so funny, winner?

122
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,600
Yeah, what's funny...

123
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,353
is that you're smegma.

124
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,596
But like...

125
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,319
ultimate smegma.

126
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,799
What does that even mean?

127
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,113
- Oh, Clare. I got it.
- Well..

128
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,231
Thank you.

129
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,674
Yeah, this is great. Um...

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,874
Smegma. It's a noun.

131
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,439
"A malodorous, opaque,
white or yellow substance

132
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,274
produced by the sebaceous glands
of male and female genitalia."

133
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,714
It's found beneath the foreskin and glands
of the penis in males,

134
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,756
and in the folds of skin surrounding
the clitoris in females.

135
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,071
Oh, I... I...

136
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,837
I'm so sorry. Would you like me to define
"ultimate" for you?

137
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,991
Oooh!

138
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,078
Come on. Yeah.

139
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,833
You got it, Clare!

140
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,792
Get up! Get up!

141
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,952
Beat her up, Clare!

142
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,431
Drop her like a red-headed baby
fresh out of the vagina!

143
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,358
Get away from her! Let her go!

144
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,991
Ooh!

145
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,759
Son of a bitch! Get back here!

146
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,471
What's in it?

147
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,552
It's broccoli, apple, lemon and ginger.

148
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,279
'Cause we don't want you to bruise.

149
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,631
You know what you need.

150
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,435
Please don't say it. Please.

151
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,916
A nice boy.

152
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,472
- You said it.
- Or a nice girl.

153
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,914
Come on, come on, come on.

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,990
You must like someone.

155
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,995
I do, but...

156
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,389
So what's his or her name?

157
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,951
Paul.

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,912
I think he said hi to me once.

159
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,151
Well, that's something.

160
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,031
In the fifth grade.

161
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,396
Hi, Max.

162
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,636
Hey.

163
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,791
There you go.

164
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,033
Man, you got the green stuff.

165
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,230
It's called "salad".

166
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,793
It's healthy and you're welcome.

167
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,434
I got you a little something, buddy.

168
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,556
It's up on your bed.

169
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,360
Dad, please...
we've talked about this already.

170
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,351
You've your space

171
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,954
- and then there's my space.
- I know!

172
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,511
I just found it at this fancy place.
It's got Chinese writing on it.

173
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,272
Figured since you're taking Chinese...

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,079
If you don't want it, Carl'll take it.

175
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,510
Shit, you're damn right.

176
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,793
Just consider it an early birthday present.

177
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,200
Come on, Max.

178
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,111
Whoa!

179
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,794

<i># And a little part, #
# Of the fear is gone... #</i>

187
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,550
Of course that would happen.

188
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,871
<i># When you say goodnight... #</i>

189
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,035
<i># These Night Lies #
# Ya little bit of my heart... #</i>

190
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,559
Seven wishes...

191
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,755
Why not?

192
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,039
I wish that...

193
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,874
Darcie Chapman,

194
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,151
would just...

195
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,916
I don't know, but just, like, go rot!

196
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,471
Max?

197
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,316
Come on! Come here!

198
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,874
Okay.

199
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,676
Oh, my God!

200
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,791
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

201
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,996
Oh, my God!

202
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,920
Oh, my God.

203
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,916
Oh, my God!

204
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,351
Darcie?

205
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,510
Darcie!

206
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,114
Oh! Ah!

207
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,954
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

208
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,919
Necrotizing fasciitis.

209
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,109
- No!
- Yeah.

210
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,156
- What?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,072
So apparently, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

212
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,833
picked up a case of it at the spa.

213
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,195
And now she's at the ICU.

214
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,755
She might lose her toes, part
of her leg, and part of her face.

215
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,320
How sweet is that?

216
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,518
Ah, she's rotting!

217
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,511
Yeah.

218
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,638
Apparently Karma is a bigger bitch
than Darcie Chapman.

219
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,756
Who knew?

220
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,117
Oh!

221
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,030
- It's for Darcie.
- Oh!

222
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,277
You said that like we should care.

223
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,953
Um, we're starting a GoFundMe.

224
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,917
Go fund this.

225
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,877
Yeah.

226
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,278
- Go on. Scooch. Bye.
- It's fine. It's fine.

227
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,317
- Meredith.
- It's whatever.

228
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,672
- Oh, my God!
- You're proud.

229
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,353
- I gotta go.
- All right.

230
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,152
Definitely have my attention, lucky box.

231
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,440
Max, come here.

232
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,351
Max?

233
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,196
Max?

234
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,636
Where are you?

235
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,951
Max?

236
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,477
Ma...

237
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,034
Max, are you in there? Buddy?

238
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,471
Buddy?

239
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,831
You in there?

240
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,471
You know you're not supposed to be down here.

241
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,270
Ow.

242
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,436
Max?

243
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,556
Max!

244
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,590
He was a good dog.

245
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,720
Mom gave him to me.

246
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,469
I know, buddy.

247
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,631
But the majority of the characters
are written in Ancient Chinese.

248
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,431
If you want an accurate translation,
you'll probably have to talk to a scholar.

249
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,159
- Got it. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

250
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,396
My cousin could hook it up.

251
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,519
Ancient Chinese is her thing.

252
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,640
She'd help you out, for a price.

253
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,279
I don't really have any money.

254
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,430
Who said anything about money?

255
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,510
He'll take a tit pic.

256
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,511
- Uh...
- And so will I.

257
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,997
- What?
- Um...

258
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,036
Never mind.

259
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,031
Sorry.

260
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,158
Offer still stands if you change your mind.

261
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,272
- Dude, seriously?
- Just kidding.

262
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,396
<i>Hey guys, do you feel that?</i>

263
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,477
It's like the darkness has been lifted

264
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,836
ever since Bitchface-Since-Birth
left the building.

265
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,392
I heard they had to amputate
a few of her toes.

266
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,950
Sweet.

267
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,998
Guys, we shouldn't be happy about this.

268
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,797
Clare, I never said I was happy.

269
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,512
I'm freaking ecstatic, man!

270
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,920
Almost like being here.

271
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,040
<i># Laying me down #</i>

272
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,715

279
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,399

280
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,677

281
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,274
I wish that

282
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,593
Paul Middlebrook
would fall madly in love with me.

Oh!

288
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,311
Hey.

289
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,190
Hey.

290
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,550
- Paul?
- Yeah.

291
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,114
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

292
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,236
- So I...
- Bell ringing.

293
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,595
I'll see you around Claire.

294
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,670
Yep!

295
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,513
Oh, my God. Oh, My God.

296
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,719
<i>And now, this news just coming in.</i>

297
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,030
- <i>A local resident...</i>
- Hey.

298
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,630
<i>...owner of the iconic
glass house estate in Gates Mills</i>

299
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,040
- What's going on?
- <i>August Anderson,</i>

300
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,272
<i>was found deceased
in his residence this afternoon.</i>

301
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,314
Are we going to the funeral?

302
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,671
Hey, as far as I'm concerned, good riddance.

303
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,720
What's gonna happen to all of his stuff?

304
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,480
If there's a will, trust me, we ain't in it.

305
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,391
Yeah.

306
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,471
Course not.

307
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,230
Ow! Dammit, Dad! Come on!

308
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,791
- What?
- We don't have room for all of this crap!

309
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,109
Hey, hey, hey.

310
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,554
- What?
- I'm going to use those.

311
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,393
What do you need these for, huh?

312
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,472
Dad, seriously.
You can't get rid of anything!

313
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,475
What would Mom say, huh?

314
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,871
Dad.

315
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,949
Dad! Are you listening to... God!

316
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,432
You never listen to anything I say!

317
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,509
Come on.

318
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,311
I wish...

319
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,278
I wish that Uncle August
would leave me everything.

320
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,431
So there.

321
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,557
God, Clare, you're so stupid.

322
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,393
Uh, thank you for calling.

323
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,471
What's going on, Dad?

324
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,630
You're never gonna believe this.

325
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,871
What?

326
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,679
Apparently, you weren't cut out of his will.

327
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,720
How much do we get?

328
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,991
All of it, buddy.

329
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,397
No way.

330
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,914
Yes... way.

331
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,230
Yes!

332
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,990
Yes! Yes! What?

333
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,031
Yes!

334
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,356
You're gonna...

335
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,353
- take the sax with us?
- Why not?

336
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,280
No, you just you haven't played since mom...

337
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,791
You never know.

338
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,319
I'm so happy for you.

339
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,116
Sweetheart.

340
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,278
Come visit, or you'll hurt my feelings.

341
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,513
- Of course.
- Okay.

342
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,193
- Dad?
- Down here, bud.

343
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,951
- What are you waiting for? Get in!
- Okay, okay, okay.

344
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,640
Oh, my God!

345
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,995
Call the girls.

346
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,160
<i># 'Cause all we ever wanted #

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,758
Um, Clare, that thing is,
like, eight hundred dollars.

352
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,876
I know.

353
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,633
Yeah, so if you buy it, you're an asshole.

354
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,831
Totally.

355
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,511
You want one?

356
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,434
No! Wait, I'm not that psycho shallow,
dude. Come on.

357
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,071
June?

358
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,638
I love you. You're my bestest friend ever.

359
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,154
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

360
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,191
Damn!

361
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,070
Peer pressure.

<i># All we ever wanted #

363
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,514

<i># All we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

366
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,200
<i># Feel like this it's all we ever wanted #</i>

367
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,712
- Bye, guys!
- Bye!

368
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,231
Hmm...

369
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,438
I found something you might like.

370
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

371
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,034
They're your mother's.

372
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,830
I found them when I was packing up our stuff.

373
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,753
Wow.

374
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,232
I forgot how good she was.

375
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,439
Where do you think you get it from?

376
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,954
Some of these are so happy.

377
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,791
So was she.

378
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,356
Until she wasn't.

379
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,080
Why do you think she did it?

380
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,277
Buddy, I've been asking myself that
every single day for the last 12 years.

381
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,310
Still don't have an answer.

382
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,634
Do you think I'm like her?

383
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,909
Course you are.

384
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,795
No, no, no, sweetie, no.

385
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,716
Not like that.

386
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,710
What I mean is, you're smart and funny,
you don't take people's crap.

387
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,593
Well, statistically, if you have a parent
that committed suicide...

388
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,400
Clare, she was a good woman,
but she had a rough childhood.

389
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,354
And secrets, honey.

390
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,716
I think that...

391
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,191
I think maybe...

392
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,870
her secrets were too big to live with and...

393
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,519
it was easier to just let go.

394
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,200
I'm sorry. Come here.

395
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,120
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just not into it any more.

396
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,993
It's not you... It's just...

397
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,120
Are you breaking up with me?

398
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,998
I can't date someone
I don't have feelings for.

399
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,951
Right.

400
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,231
Right.

401
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,791
Oh!

402
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,551
Oh!

403
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,310
So, will you?

404
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,396
Will I, what?

405
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,391
Go out with me?

406
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,071
Look...

407
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,151
I know this is short notice but

408
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,960
Senior Scavenge is coming up,
I thought it would be fun if we went.

409
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,196
Paul, you just broke up with your girlfriend.

410
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,036
Plus, I already have a team... but thank you.

411
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,160
But, we can still go.

412
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,235
Yeah, I'll think about it.

413
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,879
Yeah.

414
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,280
Oh! Um...

415
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,111
I'll see you around.

416
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,671
Nice.

417
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,155
Whoo!

418
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,030
- That's it.
- Ryan!

419
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,951
What's the price?

420
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,951
Of?

421
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,070
Your cousin helping me translate something.

422
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,719
Ah... well.

423
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,435
She's a slut for wontons.

424
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,476
Oh?

425
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,596
Done, yeah.

426
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,637
- When can we go?
- Let's go right now!

427
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,151
Awesome.

428
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,394
<i># Baby, I was so sad #</i>

429
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,351
<i># Stuck on the couch #</i>

430
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,477
So... I'm waiting.

431
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,717
For?

432
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,154
An apology. Been waiting for years.

433
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,990
What did I do?

434
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,277
First grade. Sharing circle. You farted.

435
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,589
I did not fart!

436
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,751
You farted and you blamed it on me

437
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,799
and everyone called me McFarts
until, like, the sixth grade.

438
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,471
I'm sorry.

439
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,435
Are you really?

440
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,036
Yeah.

441
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,955
Then apology accepted.

442
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,834
But maybe in the multiverse,
it never happened.

443
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,519
Or it did happen and you farted,

444
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,990
blamed it on me and I got called McFarts.

445
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,391
Wait.

446
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,670
You dig on multiverses?

447
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,840
Yeah, I mean, the theory that,
you know, another you exists

448
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,990
in different circumstances

449
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,232
under different planes of reality,
yada, yada, yada.

450
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,551
Yeah, I dig.

451
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,356
Well, maybe in the multiverse,
neither of us farted.

452
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,960
Maybe we're even dating.

453
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,070
Maybe.

454
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,796
Maybe not.

455
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,273
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

456
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,750
This.

457
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,391
Bitchin'.

458
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,872
Yeah, I don't know anything about it.

459
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,871
And I can't...

460
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,552
I can't really read what it says, but...

461
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,960
Can you open it?

462
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,399
Well, it looks like a
version of a Chinese Wish Pot.

463
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,556
They're pretty common actually.

464
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,791
You take a piece of paper,
write down your wish,

465
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,917
put it in the pot,
and wait for it to come true.

466
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,719
Let's see. This one.

467
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,590
It's heavy.

468
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,070
Okay, it promises to grant seven wishes.

469
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,034
And there are rules.

470
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,754
"Lay your hands upon me."

471
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,150
I guess you have to be touching it
to make a wish?

472
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,439
"Abandon, lose, or sell me
and all your wishes will be undone."

473
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,671
Huh.

474
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,477
Yeah, and what does... What does this say?

475
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,791
That is not a word. It's a name.

476
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,311
"Lu Mei"?

477
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,672
"The legend of Lu Mei."

478
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,431
"In 1910, bubonic plague swept through
mainland China.

479
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,360
Lu Mei and her family were suspected
of being infected

480
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,557
so they were quarantined in a train car

481
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,439
where they died of heat stroke
and dehydration.

482
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,399
Lu Mei was the only survivor.

483
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,751
Local legend says she took the only
valuable thing the family owned,

484
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,432
a music box, and went to a temple
to pray for revenge.

485
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,319
She prayed for seven days and seven nights

486
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,074
and on the seventh night,
a <i>Yaoguai</i> answered."

487
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,071
<i>"Yaoguai"</i>?

488
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,231
A demon of the Chinese persuasion.

489
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,312
If you believe in that sort of thing.

490
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,554
It says, "Lu Mei became very wealthy
and her enemies were vanquished.

491
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,111
In 1922, she died.

492
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,111
Suicide.

493
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,551
Opium."

494
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,991
Romantic.

495
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,196
So...

496
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,033
what do these numbers mean on the bottom?

497
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,800
I have no idea.

498
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,036
A mystery.

499
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,309
Um... It also says,

500
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,479
"When the music ends..."

501
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,474
something happens.

502
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,911
Like?

503
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,592
I don't know.
It could be a few different things but

504
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,718
my guy Mike at UWA, he's pretty smart, so

505
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,757
I will let you know what he says.

506
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,440
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

507
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,273
- Here, get this.
- Thanks.

508
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,871
All right. Well, me and my 'tons
need some time alone.

509
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,917
I prefer to destroy them in private.

510
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,071
Need anything else?

511
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,799
- No. We're out.
- Cool.

512
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,197
- It was great to meet you.
- You too.

513
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,475
Thanks.

514
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,436
Hey, hey.

515
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,434
She's cute. Ask her out.

516
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm trying.

517
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,998
Good luck.

Wha... What are you talking about?

I'm just hanging out with Carl,
picking up some stuff.

Dad, we live in a fricking mansion.
What else do you need?

00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,990
Clare.

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,631
Ryan.

546
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,157
Can I say something totally inappropriate?

547
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,680
Sure, go for it.

548
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,196
Your dad is, like...

549
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,559
serious hot sauce.

550
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,433
Like Sriracha hot.

551
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,310
Yes!

552
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,953
<i>Yo, it's Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

553
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,717
Hey, it's Gina.
I got that translation for you and...

554
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,074
it's messed up.

555
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,879
Fuck! Um...

556
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,633
it's so messed up,
it's actually beginning to freak me out.

557
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,116
So, ah, call me back
as soon as you can and...

558
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,833
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

559
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,949
Hello?

560
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,756
Gina!

561
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,876
Gina!

562
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,915
Gina?

563
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,836
No. No, no, no, no!

564
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,391
Fuck!

565
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,031
Oh, my God!

566
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,591
- Oh, hey. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

567
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,478
- I'm well. Where you going?
- Um...

568
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,832
just the class that we're in together.

569
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,480
Oh, yeah. Duh! I'll walk you there.

570
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,199
Sounds great. Thanks.

571
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,556
- Clare!
- Oh, hey, I'll see you at class.

572
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,270
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Ryan, where have you been?

573
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,316
Is everything okay?

574
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,357
Can I ask you something?
It's gonna sound so...

575
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,435
stupid and so crazy but, um...

576
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,114
You know that wish box your dad got you?

577
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,554
Have you made any wishes?

578
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,078
- What? Why?
- So, have you wished?

579
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,239
Why do you keep asking me that?

580
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,231
Why don't you answer?

581
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,920
Has it played any music yet?

582
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,229
Ryan, who cares? I...

583
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,310
"A blood price."

584
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,477
That phrase Gina couldn't quite translate.

585
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,471
It says...

586
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,873
"When the music ends,
the blood price is paid."

587
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,789
Um...

588
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,030
tell her I said thanks.

589
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,675
What? What is it?

590
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,910
Ah, she's, uh...

591
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,315
She's dead, Clare.

592
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,991
Oh, my God!

593
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,791
I'm so sorry. When did...

594
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,271
A few nights ago.

595
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,919
I don't even know what to say...

596
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,394
Did it play its music then?

597
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,234
I don't know what you're talking about.

598
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,000
How'd you get to live in that mansion, again?

599
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,191
We're gonna be late for class, Ryan.
Are you coming?

600
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,511
Have you?

601
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,076
Clare!

602
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,717
<i>We're going to be studying
southern China, the area of Guangzhou.</i>

603
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,918
<i>First we're going to start
with the northernmost state...</i>

604
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,351
Clare!

605
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,471
Come join us.

606
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,754
- Um, Paul...
- Okay.

607
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,114
Oh, did that just happen?

608
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,271
I think so.

609
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,911
- Oh, oh.
- Oh! Burn.

610
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,320
Still a nobody.

611
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,950
How's it feel, winner?

612
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,710
We're outta here.

613
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,436
Haters gonna hate.

614
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,193
There's not much you can do about it.

615
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,312
I wish that I was
the most popular girl in school.

616
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,514
Yeah. That'd be awesome.

617
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,349
<i># You wake the wild-hearted rebel in me #</i>

You coming with me, right?

629
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,193
- Where?
- Senior Scavenge.

630
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,716
- Yes.
- Finally. Say it again.

631
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,839
Yes.

632
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,479
- What?
- Nothing.

633
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,555
I was trying to think of something
dope to say before I kissed you.

634
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,109
That wasn't it.

635
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,957
<i># This path is difficult we travel on #</i>

636
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,115

640
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,631
Hey!

641
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,632
Hey! Wait, hey!

642
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,196
Hello?

643
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,715
Who are you?

644
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,870
Hello?

645
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,837
- Clare.
- Oh!

646
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,240
What's going on?

647
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,389
Nothing. I just...

648
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,436
Um...

649
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,999
I think that someone's following me.

650
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,436
- What? Since when?
- Um...

651
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,716
Since I got the music box.

652
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,399
Mrs. Deluca, are you home? It's Clare.

653
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,636
Mrs. Deluca?

654
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,031
Ugh!

655
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,871
Hello?

656
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,075
Hey. What's up?

657
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,511
- So cute.
- Beyond cute.

658
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,231
I don't know, Clare.

659
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,433
Why don't you go ask your new friends?

660
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,513
I mean, seriously, I don't get it.

661
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,558
Why is everyone so into you lately?

662
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,956
You're not that special.

663
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,270
Truth.

664
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,030
Hey.

665
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,031
What's wrong?

666
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,997
I need to talk to you guys about something.

667
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,638
I don't know what's going on and...

668
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,635
I don't know what to do.

669
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,071
This is it?

670
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,595
Don't... kick... that!

671
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,399
Don't do that! Okay?

672
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,675
Will someone say something?

673
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,711
All right.

674
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,553
I mean, have you ever heard of coincidence?

675
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,552
- Oh, my God!
- That's all this is, Clare.

676
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,756
Coincidence.

677
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,879
Yeah, Clare. I don't know.

678
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,111
I'm telling you,
I don't think so. I really don't.

679
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,112
You wanna know what I think, Clare?

680
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,831
Yeah.

681
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,189
I think you're a selfish bowl of bitch sauce.

682
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,917
If I had seven wishes,
you know what I'd have done?

683
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,229
I would have wished for world peace

684
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,119
and I would cure cancer.
I mean, you've used four whole wishes.

685
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,032
- Five wishes.
- Five whole wishes already.

686
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,316
And you didn't wish for anything
for me and June.

687
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,278
Nothing. We're your best friends.

688
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,273
Come on! Like, you didn't think, like...

689
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,910
"Oh, well, I know Meredith wants
an internship at Everest Games

690
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,319
- and June wants to get into Brown."
- You don't believe in this anyway!

691
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,039
- So?
- Guys, are you serious?

692
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,190
Do you think that if...

693
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,872
if I believed this from the very beginning

694
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,032
that I wouldn't have wished for my mom to...

695
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,280
over you guys? I...

696
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,759
It's okay. Say it.

697
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,390
Nothing.

698
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,953
Nothing. I just... I don't...

699
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,192
think that I should be wishing anymore.

700
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,234
I think you should throw it away.

701
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,035
Doesn't that make the most sense?

702
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,440
- Just get rid of it.
- Yeah.

703
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,917
It says if I get rid of it,
all of my wishes will be undone.

704
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,719
But if you really think people have died...

705
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,197
aren't you a bad person if you keep it?

706
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,193
Yeah. By "bad person"
June means, "psycho bitch."

707
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,637
Oh!

708
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,315
Nauseating Norma's outside,
and I'm so over this conversation.

709
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,879
Just throw it away.

710
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,390
You'll feel so much better.

711
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,239
I mean, it hasn't really worked.
I still feel miserable.

712
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,830
Toss it and it's done.

713
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,755
You won't have to worry about it anymore.

714
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,232
<i># I been up all night thinkin' #
# 'Bout what we got in store tonight #</i>

715
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,757
<i># It's about to be a celebration #
# Ain't no fakin' #</i>

716
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,796
I'll be right back.

717
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,712
- I'm gonna get us some cotton candy.
- Okay.

718
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,871
<i># Let you know #</i>

719
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,872
<i># Ain't no fear we letting go #</i>

720
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,396
- Clare, hi.
- Hi.

721
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,995
Check this out.
Junie and I are still alive, dude.

722
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,560
- Go figure, right.
- Okay.

723
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,075
Just ignore her, Clare. So, did you do it?

724
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,990
Did you throw it away?

725
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,914
Yeah, right after you guys left.

726
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,836
- Cool.
- Come on!

727
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,071
Hey, where you guys going?
The hunt's about to start.

728
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,759
Yeah. We'll be right back.

729
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,910
Hurry up.

730
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,719
Okay, be right back.

731
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,790
- Okay.
- Kids, man.

732
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,157
<i># Lightning in the fire #</i>

733
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,430
<i># Somehow it always feels #
# Like the first time #</i>

734
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,759
Wait, hang on. Paul, stop.

735
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,390
Ow.

736
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,231
What's this?

737
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,231
Nothing.

738
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,514
Let me see your phone.

739
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,795
Now, or I'm out.

740
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,436
They're just pictures of you.

741
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,194
You're even cute when you're sleeping.

742
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,314
You've been spying on me.

743
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,471
- Well, yeah.
- What is wrong with you?

744
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,710
Are you mad?

745
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,120
Yes, I'm mad.

746
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,919
You're smokin' when you're mad.

747
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,719
I think maybe that we need a break.

748
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,029
I don't.

749
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,634
I was just trying to be nice.

750
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,798
Paul, I'm breaking up with you.

751
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,432
- I gotta get out of here.
- Clare, wait.

752
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,837
This isn't over. Clare!

753
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,351
Where is she? It's about to start.

754
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,397
What? No.

755
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,755
Hey, what happened?

756
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,435
Junebug almost just got barbecued
and I saved her.

757
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,840
Hey, got ninja, right?

758
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,316
Ow-wah.

759
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,959
Wait, guys. I just got the first clue.

760
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,759
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

761
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,670
Hey, buddy. It's Dad.

762
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,878
I got a gig outside town so
I'm gonna be home around midnight. Okay?

763
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,431
I love you.

764
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,954
Shit!

765
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,160
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

766
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,435
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

767
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,631
Look.

768
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,554
- What goes up, must come down.
- Yes.

769
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,074
You get it? Alright.

770
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,040
Come on, guys, let's get this selfie.

771
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,835
Boom. Five down, five more to go.

772
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,957
Saxon's goin' down tonight.

773
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,960
All right, where to next?

774
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:20,951
Oh oh oh!

775
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,157
- Holy... ballsack.
- What?

776
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,913
Malformed Molly's in the building.

777
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,872
Twenty-sixth floor. I gotta go.

778
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,150
Are you kidding me?

779
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,920
Don't hate. Don't hate.

780
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,673
Meredith! Come on!

781
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,992
Clare! Just give me five minutes, alright?

782
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,200
And when I'm back,
Monster Mutant Master. Right here.

783
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,756
Dammit.

784
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,551
I didn't do it.

785
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,190
Do what?

786
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,991
The box. I still have it.
I couldn't throw it away.

787
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,350
That's messed up, Clare.

788
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,551
I know.

789
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,957
I tried, I just... I couldn't do it.

790
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,030
Aw man! I'm the shit!

791
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,431
Great!

792
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,151
Shit.

793
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,835
- Meredith?
- Hey. Um...

794
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,716
Clare, I'm stuck, okay?

795
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,520
<i>Please get someone to help me.
I'm stuck in this stupid elevator.</i>

796
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,831
Uh...

797
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,310
Yeah, sure.

798
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,471
Argh.

799
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,550
Crap!

800
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,715
Hey, um, never mind.

801
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,389
Dammit!

802
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,391
No!

803
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,590
Clare!

804
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,160
Meredith!

805
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,360
Meredith!

806
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,996
Meredith!

807
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,919
This is your fault.

808
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,830
All your fault.

809
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,511
Hey, come on.

810
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,439
No.

811
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,553
Come on. Let's get you outta here.

812
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:26,991
Come on.

813
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,111
You know the number on the box
that we couldn't figure out?

814
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,751
Well, I did.

815
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,474
It's a military ID number belonging to
an airman by the name of Arthur Sands.

816
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,471
That's him.

817
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,470
He was stationed in China
at the end of World War ll.

818
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,110
A few years later he opened up a
very successful car dealership in Jersey.

819
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,751
He lost his best friend in a freak accident.

820
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,477
Here's the kicker.

821
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,190
That's him six months later.

822
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,916
Oh, my God!

823
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,120
After his suicide,
his wife was institutionalized.

824
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,796
She swore a music box
had destroyed her family.

825
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,515
In the last five years or so...

826
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,271
the box resurfaced again in Cleveland,
with a man named Lawrence Hart.

827
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,517
<i>He wins the lottery, marries his high
school sweetheart and has two daughters.</i>

828
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,750
<i>A perfect life.</i>

829
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,153
<i>Until people around him start dying off.</i>

830
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,759
<i>His daughters drowned,
his wife died in a car accident</i>

831
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,153
<i>and Hart lost his mind.</i>

832
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,877
<i>He barricades himself in his house and
that's where he dies, in a massive fire.</i>

833
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,231
<i>You know what's weird?</i>

834
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,914
<i>What's left of his estate is
a few blocks from your house, Clare.</i>

835
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,080
There was another phrase on the box
I don't think you saw.

836
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,354
<i>It was a warning.</i>

837
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,917
<i>"After seven wishes,
the</i> Yaoguai <i>claims the soul."</i>

838
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,270
That's its final price.

839
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,800
- Hey.
- What?

840
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,235
How many wishes have you made?

841
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,514
I've made five wishes.

842
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,037
Jesus, Clare.
What the hell is wrong with you?

843
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:37,991
I'm sorry, but...

844
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,077
"But" how is there a "but?" People are dead!

845
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,470
It was just nice to be normal for a while.

846
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,391
That's your excuse?

847
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,675
What'd you wish for, anyway?

848
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,830
- That nice house?
- No.

849
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,998
Oh now, bullshit! People are dead, Clare.
You can't just wish that away.

850
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,150
You can't take that back.

851
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,993
I know, and I said I was sorry.

852
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,037
I didn't know that any of this would happen.

853
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:54,997
Know what I wish?

854
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,231
I wish I never met you. That's what I wish.

855
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,190
It's my fault.
And I know that I have to get rid of it.

856
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,513
Will you please help me?

857
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,030
Please, Ryan?

858
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,240
Okay, let's do it.

859
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,830
Okay.

860
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,230
Bitch!

861
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,120
She was my best friend, Clare.

862
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,470
I'm sorry.

863
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,911
What are you doing here?

864
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,798
Why haven't you answered my texts?

865
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,473
You need to leave right now.

866
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,750
What if I said...

867
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,594
I don't want to live without you.

868
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,670
And I don't want you...

869
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,796
to live without me.

870
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,392
Please. Just, just leave.

871
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,797
- So, we're done?
- Oh, my God!

872
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,311
Yes.

873
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,310
I love you, Clare.

874
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,671
Where is it?

875
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,112
What, what do you mean?

876
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,629
I don't know.

877
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,430
It's...

878
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,512
I don't know. It was right there last night.

879
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,710
It was right in there. I...

880
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,791
Oh...

881
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,236
What does that mean?

882
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,591
I...

883
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,796
Maybe it's done with you.

884
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,116
Maybe it's over.

885
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,480
Well, what now? What would I do? What...

886
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,880
You move on with your life.

887
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,477
You can do it.

888
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,994
That's easy to say, Ryan.

889
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,753
No, it's easy to wish.

890
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,275
I liked it. I liked having it.

891
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,034
It made me feel special.

892
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,075
Is there anything you wished for
that you can't live without?

893
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,399
- No.
- See, you don't need it.

894
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,311
Dad?

895
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,351
What's going on?

896
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,713
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

897
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,960
It's unbelievable. I mean, who forgets
to pay their taxes for ten years?

898
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,832
Your mother's crazy Uncle August.

899
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,838
Well, here we are.

900
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,353
Home sweet home.

901
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:53,953
<i># You're a curse #
# A disease, and I caught it #</i>

902
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,557
<i># Like a drug, slowly pulsing #</i>

903
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,233
Happy birthday, Clare.

904
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,554
<i># And I don't want it anymore #</i>

905
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,840
<i># My feet on the dash, take a drag #</i>

906
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,074
<i># I go round #</i>

907
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,357
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

908
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,751
<i># Wondering why you don't gain #</i>

909
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,679
<i># I'll stay this way for longest way #</i>

910
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,920
Recycle first.

911
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,316
Gross.

912
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,554
Mmmm, hot.

913
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,236
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

914
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:54,232
<i># They're always telling you, #
# You're going somewhere #</i>

915
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,109
<i># You're going nowhere #</i>

916
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,599
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

917
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,479
<i># They're always telling you #</i>

918
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:13,557
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

919
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,354
You stole it?

920
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,197
You couldn't get rid of it.
You saw what it did to Meredith.

921
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,794
I'm just trying to protect you, okay?

922
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,793
Okay, so you think that you can control it.

923
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,200
You think you can, Clare?

924
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,791
Really?

925
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,315
Are you crazy?

926
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,831
Why would you bring it here
in the first place?

927
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,957
'Cause I have two little sisters at home.

928
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,680
Give it back. Right now.

929
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,159
After everything that's happened?

930
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,960
Yes, June.

931
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,400
What's wrong with you?

932
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,795
No! Clare, no, stop it. Clare!

933
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,673
You see what it's done. This is a bad idea.

934
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,320
- June, go away.
- Stop, listen to me! Just stop!

935
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,790
Clare, come on! No, no, no. Clare, come here.

936
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,315
- Just give it to me, Clare. Stop.
- Let go, June!

937
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,551
- Let go! Let go!
- Clare?

938
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,875
- Clare!
- No!

939
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,830
June?

940
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,556
June? Is she going to be okay?

941
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,994
What is wrong with you?

942
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,471
Clare?

943
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,517
- Go away!
- I thought we were done with this.

944
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,590
I'm not ready yet.

945
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,194
You can't keep it. You know that.

946
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,999
- You have to get rid of it!
- You don't understand.

947
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:50,991
I'm not ready yet!

948
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,355
What about everything we talked about?

949
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,556
I won't wish anymore, okay?

950
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,319
Okay, it'll be fine. I just won't wish.

951
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,880
I'm gonna hang on to it for a while.

952
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,553
Clare, please, you're not hearing yourself.

953
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,438
You can't control it. It's controlling you!

954
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,631
Go away! Okay?

955
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,279
Please go away.

956
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,030
I have two wishes left
and if you do not go away,

957
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,954
I will use one on you,
I swear I'll use it on you.

958
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,711
Go away!

959
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,559
You can't keep running from this!

960
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,479
I know, I know what to do.

961
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,031
I know, I know what to do,
I know when to... Okay.

962
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,595
Okay.

963
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,399
If I had... No.

964
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,115
If I just don't make any more wishes,
everything will be fine.

965
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,318
Everything will be fine.

966
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,673
Clare? School just called.

967
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,159
Clare? What's going on?

968
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,990
Get down here!

969
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,550
Okay.

970
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,593
I have two wishes left.

971
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,598
I have two wishes left.

972
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,631
Two wishes.

973
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,074
I wish my mother never committed suicide.

974
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,915
Oh, God.

975
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,431
Clare?

976
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,750
Mom?

977
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,877
Mom?

978
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,834
I missed you so much!

979
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,038
You missed me so much? What?

980
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,116
Happy birthday! We got you cake!

981
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,437
- Sssh!
- And presents!

982
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,273
Okay, come on. What's the holdup?
Downstairs, kiddo. Chop-chop.

983
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,717
Al'right. Here it is.

984
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,120
Yay!

985
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,238
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

986
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,955
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

987
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,359
Happy birthday, kiddo.

988
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,351
Thank you, Dad.

989
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,231
Make a wish.

990
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,790
Clare?

991
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,396
I'm up here.

992
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,319
Come open your presents.

993
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,751
Okay.

994
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,154
<i>Mommy! Come on, Max!</i>

995
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,355
This is your fault.

996
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,600
This is your fault. Everything is your fault.

997
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,236
Oh, my God!

998
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:58,996
What?

999
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,269
No. No!

1000
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,990
Yeah, right there is good.

1001
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,119
- Yeah.
- You think so, man?

1002
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,795
No, no, no, no!

1003
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,032
Dad! Dad!

1004
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,952
Dad!

1005
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,838
Dad!

1006
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,956
- Oh, my God! My God!
- No!

1007
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,310
Jon!

1008
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,230
No...

1009
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,476
Argh!

1010
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,553
- No!
- Are you...

1011
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,597
What happened? Are you...

1012
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,115
Jonathan! No!

1013
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,314
No! No!

1014
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,357
I've got one wish left.

1015
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,878
I know how to beat you!

1016
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,430
I wanna go back!

1017
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,552
I wanna go back before I got you!

1018
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,196
I wanna go back.

1019
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,560
My final wish is I wanna go back
to the morning my dad found you.

1020
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,317
I wanna go back right now!

1021
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,435
Max?

1022
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,231
Hi, Max!

1023
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,479
Mmm... hi.

1024
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,360
Oh, who's a good boy!

1025
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,676
Wait.

1026
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,031
Wait, wait, wait. Wait! Wait!

1027
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,716
Wait! Wait!

1028
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,792
Wait! Hang on, hang on!

1029
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,871
<i>I'm not awake right now.</i>

1030
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,952
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- Nothing. Hi.

1031
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,316
I just wanted to, you know, hear your voice.

1032
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,996
<i>Seriously? You don't need a kidney
or some ridiculous words of wisdom?</i>

1033
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,833
- No, I just, no...
- <i>Alright, you know</i>

1034
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,958
- <i>I'm gonna go back to sleep, okay? Night!</i>
- Okay, okay.

1035
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,276
Dad!

1036
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,950
- Hey!
- Hey. What's all this?

1037
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,514
Um, nothing. I just... um I was just
wondering if I could go with you guys.

1038
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,955
You know, like old times.

1039
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,153
- Yeah. Get in.
- Awesome.

1040
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,110
Sure, it'll be like old times.
Be our good luck charm.

1041
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,719
Aw, you look so nice.

1042
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,555
Clare, you find anything?

1043
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,869
I found...

1044
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,760
I found these. I don't know
what you could use them for.

1045
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,910
Maybe around the house?
I don't know, they're kind of neat.

1046
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,998
- Yeah, I can do something with these.
- Yeah?

1047
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,037
Hey, Carl. Check it out.

1048
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,040
Told you my kid has an eye.

1049
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,118
You always were my good luck charm.

1050
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,156
You gotta come with us again.

1051
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,271
Yeah, maybe I will.

1052
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,760
I have to get to school,
but have fun today. Love you.

1053
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:54,751
Love you too, buddy.

1054
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,359
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- You got it.

1055
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,680
Let's go buddy.

1056
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,954
Ryan! Ryan, hey.

1057
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,550
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, sure.

1058
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,990
Okay, um...

1059
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,032
First off, I just wanted to say, um...

1060
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,030
I'm sorry for the whole McFarts thing.

1061
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,876
Wait. What? Really?

1062
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,560
Yeah. Um...

1063
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,953
But you know what, maybe in the
multiverse, that didn't happen.

1064
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,474
- Hold on, you dig on multiverses?
- Yeah.

1065
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,951
And, also, maybe in the multiverse,
we're really good friends.

1066
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,711
Maybe... we're even dating.

1067
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,637
Well... have we done it?

1068
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,476
No, not yet.

1069
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,470
I have also met your cousin, Gina.
Hung out in her loft and everything.

1070
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,911
Okay, you're freaking me out right now.

1071
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,990
Yeah, good.

1072
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,955
'Cause I need a favor.

1073
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,192
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy but...

1074
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,914
please don't open this.

1075
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,674
Just... just bury it. No shortcuts.

1076
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,559
Uh... okay.

1077
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,790
What's in it for me?

1078
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,435
Dinner, if you want?

1079
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,073
And maybe we could talk more
on this whole multiverse thing?

1080
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,034
Yeah, and you can tell me how you
know my cousin and that she has a loft.

1081
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,995
- Done.
- Cool.

1082
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,591
Dude!

1083
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,111
I'll see you around.

1084
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,949
I didn't see her.

1085
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,800
I just didn't see her.
