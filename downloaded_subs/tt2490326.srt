1
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,410
Shh.

2
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,925
<i>It's a beautiful
summer day in Chicago today.</i>

3
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,491
<i>Temperatures expected
to reach the upper 80s.</i>

4
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,579
<i>In recent news, a health advisory was
reported from Happy Poultry Farms.</i>

5
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,255
<i>They're telling us
they're issuing a full recall</i>

6
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,461
<i>for their pre-cooked chicken tenders
and also their buffalo chicken tenders.</i>

7
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,387
<i>This only applies to chicken
that was packaged Friday</i>

8
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,387
<i>and delivered to Fort Chicken
and Danville.</i>

9
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,595
Morning, honey.
- Ahem.

10
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,896
Rise and shine.

11
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,098
- Morning, Mum.
- How's the book going?

12
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,776
Good. Yeah, I've been working
really hard on it.

13
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,981
Rewriting it. It's a first draught,
you know. Did you get a chance

14
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,863
- to read the manuscript?
- I did and I loved it.

15
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,697
- Oh. Any thoughts? Criticisms?
- No, I thought it was wonderful.

16
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,668
I won't become a better writer if I don't
get constructive criticism. Please.

17
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,121
- I'm begging you.
- Well,

18
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:53,382
um, I did think the characters
were a tiny bit unlikeable.

19
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,631
- That's more like it. Noted.
- And it was a little slow.

20
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,433
I found myself a little bored,
to be honest.

21
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,354
- And I heart honesty.
- I also didn't know what was going on

22
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,898
or where we were.
It wasn't explained well.

23
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,068
I couldn't figure out the plot.
It was kind of insulting.

24
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,238
And there was no specificity
in terms of time and place.

25
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,193
- And where was the inciting incident?
- OK, OK, this is... Wow.

26
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,327
Thank you, heh.

27
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,827
But mostly I loved it.

28
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,002
Now, get up and teach those summer
school kids how to write like you.

29
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:34,548
Chapter one. The boat was evil,
but he loved the boat.

30
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:41,639
Chapter one. The boat was evil,
but he didn't know just how evil.

31
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,515
The boat was evil,

32
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,393
but it was an acceptable level of evil.

33
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,477
Chapter one. The sea-faring vessel,
<i>The Schooner,</i> was evil.

34
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,650
Ah. It's getting there.

35
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:07,251
Jesus. I've come full circle.
How very, very utterly depressing.

36
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,459
What's up, amigo? Hey.

37
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,042
- You're not my dealer.
- No, I'm Clint...

38
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,005
- Hey, you don't sell shrooms do you?
- No. I'm Clint Hadson.

39
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,930
<i>Is that Hudson?</i>

40
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,801
- Hadson.
- Yeah, it's him. I'll let him in.

41
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,019
- Oh. So that's a no on the shrooms?
- Right.

42
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,995
Excuse me.

43
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,327
I'm having trouble...

44
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,388
Don't you forget, you're grounded.

45
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,769
When school's over
you come straight home.

46
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,317
- Fuck you, Mum.
- Oh, yeah? Fuck you.

47
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,147
- I'm just gonna miss you so much.
- Can't I take it off?

48
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,483
No. The playground is a war zone.

49
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,363
- Watch it.
- Sorry. Didn't see you there.

50
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,950
Well, maybe you should take in
your surroundings more.

51
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,077
Yeah.

52
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,926
- Mr. Hudson.
- Hadson.

53
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,049
- Hi. Uh, call me Clint.
- Righteous.

54
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,221
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

55
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,392
Mrs. Kenner is down with the flu,
or maybe she's pregnant.

56
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,720
She is Mormon, so that's a possibility.

57
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,057
I'm vice principal Simms.
Principal Hodges is in the Bahamas.

58
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,561
You know what they say.

59
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,440
When the cat's away, the vice principal
becomes acting principal.

60
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,816
I forgot they say that.

61
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,897
Teacher's lounge is across the way.

62
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,076
Go get a cup of joe.
It's not strong enough for my taste.

63
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,121
To deal with these terrors I need
the high-octane stuff. Isn't that right?

64
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,574
Heh, she's hilarious.
A lot of personal tragedy.

65
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,412
Come on in to this office.
Pull up a ball chair.

66
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,667
Got a cell phone?

67
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,836
Um, yeah.

68
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,463
- I'm gonna have to take it.
- Are you serious?

69
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,423
Yep. This is a no cell-phone campus.
We can't ask the kids to give up

70
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,476
something we're not willing to.
So hand over that crackberry.

71
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:35,524
Booyah. Now, I gotta warn you,
I run a pretty tight ship.

72
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,897
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

73
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,901
Heh, it's funny you should say that.
I'm actually writing a book about a ship.

74
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,403
Well, it's more of a boat.
I have it with me.

75
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,986
If you're asking me to describe
my pedagogical "philosophy"

76
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,663
- I'm not.
- Some charter schools out of Boston

77
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,243
are "absolutely" "revolutionising"
"education."

78
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,579
I'm not sure you know
how air quotes work.

79
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,460
I wanna bring these kids back
to a pre-digital era.

80
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,840
No cell phones, and I don't care
if it's raining labradoodles,

81
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,513
I wanna get those kids outside
during recess.

82
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,557
Heck, I'll lock them out.
And I will do that.

83
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:13,558
Now, here's a map of the school.
Mrs. Kenner is in Room 12.

84
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:18,359
Oh, I don't need that.
I actually used to go here. Class of '88.

85
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,779
Hey, you know what that is?
That's out of sight.

86
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,448
- All right.
- Shouldn't joke about guns though.

87
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,945
- No.
- Not in a school.

88
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,652
- Yeah.
- That's not funny.

89
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,532
My partner's name is David.
He is awesome.

90
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,870
He's a little bit older,
but really has this amazing body.

91
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,955
If I'm being completely honest,

92
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,667
he does have these fantastic balls
that I just love to play with.

93
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,425
They're firmer and fuzzier, so...

94
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:53,639
Heh, tennis partner.
Heh, David's my tennis partner. Heh.

95
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,726
Hi there. Um, you know which
one of these is Mrs. Kenner's?

96
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,483
Buddy, I don't know
what that bitch drinks out of.

97
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,190
Here's what I do know.
I know that this is a rape button.

98
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,572
It emits a shit-crazy alarm
that will inform local police,

99
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:15,123
who'll arrive within two minutes should
you decide to get touchy and/or feely.

100
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,042
Wanna know why I have a rape button?
Don't answer.

101
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,747
Because the State of Illinois
doesn't trust the citizenry enough

102
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,084
to pass safe, sensible,
conceal and carry laws.

103
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,964
OK.

104
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,304
So any of these then?

105
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,684
Hm. She's a little tightly wound, huh?

106
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,072
Oh, my God.

107
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,955
Lucy? Lucy McCormick?

108
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,253
- It's Clint Hadson.
- Oh, my God.

109
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,706
- Wow, what are you doing here?
- I'm subbing for Mrs. Kenner.

110
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,504
Oh, my God. Amazing.

111
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,427
I heard you lived in New York.

112
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,675
Yeah, I did. In Brooklyn.

113
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,054
But now I'm in town for a while.
Staying at Charman's.

114
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,260
Oh.

115
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,937
- Who's Charman?
- My mum.

116
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,608
But it's the guesthouse, so it's...

117
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,486
So you're a teacher now?

118
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,401
No. Well, I mean yes.

119
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:35,158
I subbed a little in New York,
but I'm a writer.

120
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,863
That's great.

121
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,625
God, it's a scorcher out there, huh?

122
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,373
Unseasonably warm.

123
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,422
Yeah.

124
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,010
Uh, Wade, have you met Clint?

125
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,849
I have not. Wade Johnson. Pleased
to meet you with meat to please you.

126
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,771
Actually, we kind of met earlier.
You parked me in.

127
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,733
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. It's... It's fine.

128
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,608
It's just that, um, you parked so close
that I couldn't get out of my car.

129
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,813
My truck's got a dual real wheel.

130
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,907
- I'm sorry?
- Dual real wheel.

131
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,283
Dual real... Dual real...

132
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:22,334
Dual real real. Dual real...

133
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,998
Dual real wheel.

134
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,546
Dual real... Real real.

135
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,051
It's got a dual real wheel.
Dual real wheel. Dual real...

136
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,933
- Dual real.
- I don't understand.

137
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,309
It's got two extra wheels
on the back part of it.

138
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,815
Dual rear...

139
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,736
So, Clint, heard tell you were a writer,
hmm?

140
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:54,316
- What have you written?
- Ah. Nothing that you've read, yet.

141
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,992
I'm actually working on
my first novel.

142
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,116
- Really?
- Yeah.

143
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,414
Oh, yeah, well, that's actually
why I'm home.

144
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,994
You know, just to hunker down
and bang out that story.

145
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,001
But, uh, I need a few shekels.

146
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,713
Shekels.

147
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,594
- Hebrew for...
- Doug.

148
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,593
...currency. Yeah. OK.

149
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,967
- Wow. Good for you. That's so exciting.
- Thanks.

150
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,927
What's it about?

151
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,264
Oh. Uh, well, it's a horror novel.

152
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,894
Um, it's about a guy who buys a boat,

153
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,945
but the boat turns out
to be possessed.

154
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,072
Like <i>Christine.</i>

155
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,485
- I'm sorry?
- <i>Christine</i> by Stephen King.

156
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,162
The guy buys a car
and it's possessed.

157
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,535
- Um, but this is about a boat.
- So it's like <i>Speed 2?</i>

158
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,708
Starring...?

159
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,132
Sandra Bullock, yes, of course, and...

160
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,795
- Keanu Reeves?
- Jason Patric.

161
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,677
- I am the biggest Jason Patric fan.
- Jason Patric, heh.

162
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,181
- <i>Lost Boys.</i> Kiefer.
- "They're not lost, they're vampires."

163
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,071
- They got lost.
- All right. Let's roll.

164
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:14,233
Your classroom is actually right next
to mine. I can walk you if you want.

165
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,281
Um, yeah. That would be great.

166
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:27,793
You are so fucking ugly.

167
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,421
If my butthole had a butthole,
that's what you'd look like.

168
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,171
Yeah, you look like my butthole's ass.

169
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,218
You look like you got chicken pox.

170
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,671
If chicken pox was made out
of haemorrhoids.

171
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,974
Yeah, if chicken pox
was made out of my ass.

172
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,269
And here we are.
Fourth grade, that's me, heh.

173
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:50,349
And you're right up there. Good luck.
Holler if you need anything.

174
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,685
Or you can ask Wade.
The athletic office is right down there.

175
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,318
Yeah, what's with that guy?
He seems like a bit of a dick.

176
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,775
Heh. He's my boyfriend.

177
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,656
Sorry, I'm late.
I was helping a friend out.

178
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,616
Eric, what is that?
You just put that right down now.

179
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,758
Hey, did somebody order a sub?

180
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,382
Tough crowd, heh.

181
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,642
My uncle's cancer

182
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,516
took his stomach.

183
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,347
But his divorce

184
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,975
took his mind.

185
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,857
Anyhoo...

186
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,023
That was my weekend.
Let's begin class.

187
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,201
Maybe we were created
by an all-knowing God

188
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,280
who sent down his only son
to die for us,

189
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,366
or maybe we were monkey people
who sat around

190
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,794
crapping in each other's mouths
until one day we were like:

191
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:57,090
"I don't like all this hair.
Just on my head and crotch, please."

192
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,004
Who can say?

193
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:04,430
I can't, because the State of Illinois
doesn't allow me to, Hank.

194
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,680
I know I'm the substitute,
but I'm also a friend.

195
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,141
It wasn't so long ago that
I was sitting exactly where you are.

196
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,567
In fact,
don't tell those other teachers,

197
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,145
but I want you to call me
by my first name.

198
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,196
- "Cunt"?
- What?

199
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,577
No. You can't say...

200
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,251
OK, no. Uh, my name is Clint.

201
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,999
You know what?
Just call me Mr. Hadson.

202
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:44,721
I'm not really a teacher.
I'm only substituting to pay the bills.

203
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,892
I'm actually writing a horror novel.
Pretty cool, huh?

204
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,388
Yeah, real cool, asshole.

205
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,104
- Excuse me? What's your name?
- Patriot.

206
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,273
- He got held back.
- Shut up.

207
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,359
Your name is Patriot?

208
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,478
That's right.

209
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,654
I was born on September 11th.

210
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,233
God sent me on that day.

211
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,739
That's why on my 18th birthday,

212
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,198
I'm joining the Marines
just to kick some towel-head ass.

213
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,118
Wow. A lot to unpack there.

214
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,125
First off, could you keep
the language down, please?

215
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,047
Otherwise, I'll send you outside.

216
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,878
Yeah, while you were talking,
I just looked at like a hundred vaginas.

217
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,053
- All right. Give me that.
- Why?

218
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,303
You're not allowed to have it.
Your principal told me.

219
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,727
How about I start crying
and suggest to my parents

220
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,726
about how you touched me
inappropriately?

221
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:43,939
Wait. You didn't happen to write
on a Prius this morning, did you?

222
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:52,497
OK. So I actually have the first
draught of my new novel with me.

223
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,959
Who would like to come up here
and read the first chapter?

224
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,252
And then you guys can
give me some notes.

225
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,329
- Great. What's your name?
- Ahem. Douche.

226
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,629
- Calvin.
- Calvin, come on down.

227
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,263
Go ahead.

228
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,730
"Chapter one. Trent always loved boats,
but when he spent his life savings

229
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,810
on the <i>Anna Marie,</i> he didn't know
he'd just charted a course to evil.

230
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,020
It was an easy money transaction..."

231
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,980
You'd be good in a horror novel.

232
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,662
Hey.

233
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,123
You listening to me?

234
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,227
All right. Everyone calm down.
Stay here.

235
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,681
I'm gonna take Patriot to the nurse.
Come on. Come on.

236
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,440
Don't be a baby.

237
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,857
Come on, Patriot. Let me see.
Come on.

238
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,072
This is going to need stitches.
There's nothing I can do about it here.

239
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,371
- He's gonna have to go to the hospital.
- That's OK.

240
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,948
Patriot can handle it.

241
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,999
Right, Patriot? You're a Marine.

242
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,193
Beautiful, beautiful shrooms.

243
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,994
So one of my students tried
to eat another one's face off.

244
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,543
How's your day going?
I'm really sorry about this morning.

245
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,542
- What happened?
- Uh, I called your boyfriend a dick.

246
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,716
I didn't know you guys were dating
and now I feel awkward.

247
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,044
No, in your classroom.
What happened?

248
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,131
Oh. This girl went ape-shit on this kid.
She was biting him.

249
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,592
- I sent him to the nurse.
- Did you send her to the principal?

250
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,020
You kidding? I wanted to give
her a high-five. That kid's a dick.

251
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,410
Hey.

252
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,580
You bit my friend's face.

253
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,752
What, are you sick or something?

254
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,803
Hey, you bitch.

255
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,011
I just wanted to say to them, like,

256
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,014
"Guys, I'm a writer
who moved here from New York City.

257
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,721
"Like, I'm way cooler than
your regular teacher."

258
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,433
- This day could've been super fun.
- Kids are always rough on subs.

259
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,315
This is different from
what we were like growing up.

260
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,112
They're, like, not even kids.

261
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,502
The fuck?

262
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,789
He can't be that funny.

263
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,620
So single. Ooh-la-la.

264
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,002
Yeah, I'm such a catch.

265
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:55,383
You'll be beating off the women
in Fort Chicken.

266
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,585
Oh, yeah. Fort Chicken girls.

267
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,295
Yeah, the hottest.

268
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,391
What is happening here, kids?

269
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,196
Goddamnit.

270
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,616
What is wrong with me?

271
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,296
Oh, no, you didn't.

272
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,669
<i>Vice Principal Simms?</i>

273
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,631
Yeah, you're go for Simms.

274
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,212
I'm under some

275
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,514
medication for a medical condition

276
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:47,514
So I may not be seeing things
correctly.

277
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:53,316
<i>But I'm pretty sure I might be seeing
some of your students</i>

278
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,395
possibly eating Mr. Peterson.

279
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,316
<i>Again, it could be the medication.</i>

280
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,498
OK. All right. Shaw's over.

281
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,878
Hey, I may be acting principal,
but you all are acting crazy.

282
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,584
Hey, don't... Don't...

283
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,962
I have bursitis.
I have bursitis in my elbow.

284
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,719
Who...? Who is your homeroom?

285
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,208
Get... Get out of there.

286
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,708
- It's so good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

287
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,259
Oh, look. Carnage.

288
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,849
- Somebody call the police.
- Wait. Oh, hey, my button.

289
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,026
Come on, Johnson.
What the fuck is happening?

290
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,276
What the fuck is happening?

291
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,748
Wait, there's Wade. Wade.

292
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,706
Oh, God.

293
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,791
All right, listen up.

294
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,761
I'd back off if I was you.

295
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,340
I was an all-state football champion,
y'all are a bunch of kids.

296
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,350
Look, we've all wanted to do that
to Vice Principal Simms, OK?

297
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,271
I know I have.

298
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,433
But a...

299
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,143
A line has been crossed.

300
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,158
You can't eat the teachers, man.

301
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,487
Calm down right now.

302
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,549
Come on, Johnson.

303
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,423
Run, Johnson.

304
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,978
They attacked the vice principal.

305
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,022
<i>Ma 'am, you need to calm down.</i>

306
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,692
Then they started chas...
Hello? Hello?

307
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,114
The phones are dead.

308
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,918
Those kids are fast.

309
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,292
I was twice voted running back
of the year,

310
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:06,171
Cary County,
and should've went a third year,

311
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,802
but it was political...

312
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,176
- What the fuck are you trying to say?
- Do not go out there. Those kids...

313
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,561
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, no, no. It's Angela.

314
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,310
Hi, Angela. It's me, Mr. Lacey.

315
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,854
Oh, there's Dave. Dave's coming.

316
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,362
See, everything's gonna be fine.

317
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,326
Shit, man. Five-0.

318
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,328
Fuck it. I ain't going down.

319
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,664
All right, kids. Settle down.

320
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,795
You little guys need to tell me
what's going on.

321
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,548
You all eat cherry pie for lunch
or something? What's going on?

322
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,262
I'm here to help. Think of me
just like Batman. I'm a helper.

323
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,775
What the fuck?!

324
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:31,176
- Fuck this. I gotta do something.
- No. You can't go back out there.

325
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,720
- No. Let me alone.
- Wade?

326
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,635
Oh, my God.

327
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,311
Oh, God.

328
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,941
What the fuck, freak?

329
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,980
- He's gonna bite your face.
- I can see that.

330
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,738
He'll tear your goddamn face off.
You'll look like that chimp woman.

331
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,244
You're achieving nothing.

332
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,624
- Help me!
- Let me burn his face!

333
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,259
Who is that lady?

334
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,964
- Anybody have a key?
- Probably not.

335
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,810
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

336
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,310
- We can't just leave her there.
- Come on.

337
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,902
Move. Move.

338
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,275
Come on.

339
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,650
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
Follow me. I do CrossFit.

340
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,905
- No, don't do it.
- You sons of bitches.

341
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,371
Fuck.

342
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,498
- Go, go, go.
- Wade, what...?

343
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,917
In here.

344
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,215
- Kill him! I hate it! Kill him!
- No. Wait. He's not like the others.

345
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,639
And I'm not saying that because
you're the only black student.

346
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,637
- Differences make life beautiful.
- What's going on?

347
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,687
- Kill him!
- No, wait. Tracy's right.

348
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,857
Calvin, are you OK? You don't have
a thirst for blood or anything?

349
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,276
Why would I?
I'm studying for my test.

350
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,899
- Great. How's it going?
- OK, fuck the test.

351
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,153
- We gotta seek out higher ground.
- OK. Come on, Calvin.

352
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,200
You come with us.

353
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,463
We're clear. In here, come on.

354
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,916
- Come on.
- Close the door. Close the door.

355
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,467
- Close the door.
- Get it.

356
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,341
- Hey, hey. Is everyone OK?
- I think so. Yes.

357
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,139
- Are you OK?
- Can we please take a moment...?

358
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,263
Get in here. Come on. Come on.

359
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,265
She has blisters.

360
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,731
We're safe. The door is locked.
They can't get through these windows.

361
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,524
The phone's out in here too.

362
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,025
Can somebody explain to me
what is going on? What is going on?!

363
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,571
I blame rap music.

364
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,776
I hated my teachers in school.
But I never tried to kill them.

365
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,202
- They got cooties.
- What?

366
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,950
That's what they're always saying that
girl Shelly has. Cooties. She's dirty.

367
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,587
- Calvin, that's not very nice.
- No, he's right.

368
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,004
In a... In a way.
If you'll follow me, you'll see...

369
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,381
- You're not hurt, are you?
- No, I'm good.

370
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,885
...she has the raised blisters of a vi...

371
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,224
A virus.

372
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,177
I'm OK. We're safe here, right?

373
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,390
Everybody feels OK?
And we're all safe.

374
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,601
It's pretty interesting actually.

375
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,771
I knew we'd work it all out, heh.

376
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,999
I would love to get inside your head.

377
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,622
Oh.

378
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,126
She's gone to commit murder
somewhere else.

379
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,797
All right, ladies, here's the plan.

380
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,504
We get down on that ledge,
jump to the ground,

381
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,182
hightail it like linebackers
to our cars, boom.

382
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,181
I thought you tried to outrun them.

383
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,855
- You said they were too fast for you.
- Yeah, but that was before

384
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,557
I had a weapon.

385
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,102
A violin?

386
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,232
Not just a violin.
It's an instrument of death.

387
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,197
I propose we create
a symphony of death.

388
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,575
Everyone grab an instrument.
Here. You take this.

389
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,124
- Oh, yeah, that'll be real effective.
- I'm offering leadership.

390
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,999
What are you offering, besides
throwing hot pots of coffee at people,

391
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:39,299
or a stupid book no one wants to read
about a guy who wants to fuck a boat?

392
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,843
It's not about a guy
who wants to fuck a boat.

393
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,593
- It's about obsession and possession...
- He wants to fuck the boat.

394
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,720
- Listen...
- Listen, Stevie King...

395
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:51,303
There's an invention called a cell phone
that your school confiscated.

396
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,185
We need to get to the office,
grab our phones

397
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,268
and call someone who can help
quarantine these kids.

398
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,945
We're in a lockdown
in case you haven't noticed.

399
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,945
We have been breached. There are
little cootie kids out in the hallway

400
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,369
who will fucking rip your face off
with their little teeth.

401
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,322
- Well, shit...
- Their big teeth haven't come in yet.

402
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,839
You carry on
with your symphony of death.

403
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,758
I'll sneak around the school
where there aren't kids.

404
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,212
Oh, you sneak around, huh?
Sneak around like a little hobbit.

405
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,923
I'm taking the fight to them
like a fucking orc.

406
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,225
That's the difference
between you and me.

407
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,474
I don't wanna scurry.
I don't scurry like a common squirrel.

408
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,932
Both of you be quiet! The only way
we're gonna get anywhere

409
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,361
is if we turn our frowns upside down
and try to get along. OK?

410
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,485
You know how I beat
the terrorists after 9/11?

411
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,693
- With a positive attitude.
- It's true. She did.

412
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,536
I don't think going back for our
cell phones is necessarily a great idea.

413
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,586
Even though it's wonderful that you're
trying. We welcome all suggestions.

414
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,335
- Wait, I just thought of something.
- What is it?

415
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,169
Um, it's just an idea for <i>Keel Them All.</i>
The hero's trapped on the boat

416
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:08,426
and my mum doesn't understand why
he wouldn't just call for help. I got it.

417
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,632
He left his phone on the dock.

418
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,968
What are you talking about?

419
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,178
Oh, sorry. My book.

420
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,142
Are you fucking kidding me?

421
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,901
- Unbelievable.
- Your book is called <i>Keel Them All?</i>

422
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,605
OK, can we convene the book club
a little later on, please?

423
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:29,990
Wade, I think maybe your idea is
maybe an unwise idea also.

424
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,072
- Seriously, Lucy?
- I'm sorry.

425
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,331
So, what do you propose?

426
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,536
That we wait here until 3.00.

427
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:44,379
Um, OK, what happens at 3.00?

428
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,302
At 3.00 the parents will come
to pick up their kids.

429
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,755
We get on the roof
and signal them for help.

430
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:53,558
- I like that idea. It's a good one.
- Better than your fucking idea.

431
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,137
- Anything's better than your idea.
- Oh.

432
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,477
Clint, are you OK? That sounds...

433
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,854
Yeah, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

434
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,435
What happened to your arm?

435
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,066
- Oh, it's nothing...
- Ah.

436
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,241
- Oh, shit.
- What? It's just a scratch.

437
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,569
- He's infected.
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

438
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,700
You got cooties, motherfucker.
Time for a quarantine.

439
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,498
- No. I'm feeling fine.
- You're coming with me.

440
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,043
- Stop resisting. Don't resist.
- I feel fine.

441
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,497
- Quarantine.
- Wade. Wade.

442
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,384
Let me out, asshole.

443
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,629
Nobody else go in there.

444
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,098
I'm going in.

445
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,521
Doug, don't... I don't care-.

446
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,191
<i>We have
some breaking news developing</i>

447
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,451
<i>in the suburb of Fort Chicken
this morning...</i>

448
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,082
- What if he...?
- Excuse me. Listen up, please.

449
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,163
Could everybody please listen up?

450
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,258
Guys, don't make me ask again.
Quiet. Quiet, please.

451
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,512
- Please, be quiet.
- None of us are talking.

452
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,514
Rebekka.

453
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,061
Quiet, please.

454
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,770
Thank you. It is my opinion

455
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,602
- that Clint has been infected with...
- I knew it.

456
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,610
- ...whatever those kids have out there.
- Oh, my God.

457
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,317
It doesn't seem to be
affecting him the same way.

458
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,654
He's only exhibiting
mild stomach-flu symptoms.

459
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:43,415
Nausea, cramps, a little diarrhoea,
vomiting, mild anal leakage.

460
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:48,715
But it is my hypothesis
that we are safe from him for now.

461
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,590
He will not attempt to murder us
or tear us limb from limb.

462
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,297
- He just has the flu.
- Hold on a second.

463
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,974
How do you...?
How do you know all this?

464
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,102
Well, Rebekka,
I just examined his fluids

465
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,478
with two of histories oldest
scientific instruments. My hands.

466
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,855
Doug.

467
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,108
- Heh, don't worry. I'm wearing gloves.
- Oh, no, you're not.

468
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,235
- No.
- No, you're not.

469
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,697
- Damn it, Doug.
- Keep it together.

470
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,744
I see.

471
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,989
OK, OK, it doesn't matter.

472
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,370
Listen, the sub stays locked
in the closet.

473
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,125
He gets a clean bill of health at 3.00,
then we'll talk.

474
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,390
Go time.

475
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,109
- Keep your distance, Grisham.
- There's vomit there.

476
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,654
- Sorry. Watch your step.
- Are you all right?

477
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,777
- How you feeling? Come on.
- Um, better.

478
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,575
- OK. That's yours.
- Oh, thank you.

479
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,449
Wait. Oh, I know that car.

480
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,655
That's the PTA president,
Racer Dopkins' mum.

481
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,786
She gets here early
to open the gates.

482
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,742
- Hey, hey, over here!
- Hey!

483
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,248
- Hey!
- Hey!

484
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,874
Hey!

485
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,673
- Call for help!
- Use the phone!

486
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,929
This could fall apart.
I'm just thinking about the children.

487
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,630
- Hey!
- 911!

488
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,933
Those little bastards
are gonna kill her.

489
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,305
- She's gonna be fine.
- Wait, there he is.

490
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,228
- No, no.
- Don't open the door.

491
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,604
- She doesn't even see him.
- Don't let him in! Don't let him in!

492
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,071
Who's Mummy's angel?
Who's Mummy's angel?

493
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,490
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

494
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,408
- Get out of the car!
- No!

495
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,532
- You tell Simms that $300 won't cut it.
- Mrs. Dobkins!

496
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,409
Mrs. Dobkins, don't do it!

497
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,536
God, Steve. Don't even give me that.

498
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,868
I know what's going on
in the school 24/7.

499
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,293
Come on, Racer. Let's go.

500
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,034
You wanna go to soccer practise
or not, honey puckle?

501
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,378
I'm not gonna be the one holding the
book at the book ride again this year.

502
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,463
No. You...

503
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,476
Racer, what the hell are you doing
to your brother back there now?

504
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,728
- They go right for the face.
- I told you.

505
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,779
We have to warn the others.
They'll be here any second.

506
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,527
They'll massacre the other parents.

507
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,030
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

508
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,615
- Oh, my God!
- Help me.

509
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,038
- She's not one of them.
- How do you know?

510
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,991
Look at her face.
It's not covered in pox.

511
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,915
- Help her.
- Oh, God. They're coming.

512
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,541
They're coming.

513
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,418
They're coming.

514
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,672
They're getting up on the roof.
They're in the tree.

515
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,720
Move!

516
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,260
- Come on!
- Go, go, go!

517
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,638
- Where do we go?
- Go, go, go.

518
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,640
To the auditorium.

519
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,723
Don't give up. Let's go.

520
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,357
Move, move, move.

521
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,527
Help! Get it off me! Get it off!

522
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,332
Wade, I...

523
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,797
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

524
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:51,135
Tammy, why don't you and Calvin
come on over here with me?

525
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,437
- That guy always cheated off me.
- Calvin.

526
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,311
I'll make sure
all the doors are secure.

527
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,781
Why...? Why is his blood black?

528
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,659
I don't know.

529
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,998
That's what I wanna find out.

530
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,789
I think I'm gonna dissect him.

531
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,964
Hey, look at us.
We're fine. We're fine.

532
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,795
You know, we're still us, because...
You know why?

533
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,723
Because none of us got bitten
or scratched.

534
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,262
I did.

535
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:35,641
Oh.

536
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,314
It's fine. We'll go to the washroom
and wash it out with soap

537
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,271
so it won't get infected, OK?
What do you say?

538
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,661
Oh, God.
I can't believe you're doing this.

539
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:59,290
I can't believe boys pee in those.
I mean, that's disgusting.

540
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,791
That's disgusting?

541
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,716
It's not disgusting to have boys
staring at each other's penises?

542
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:08,762
What's wrong with that?
OK, we got bigger things to worry about.

543
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,713
Well, this is interesting.

544
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,924
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

545
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,510
- Oh, God.
- I'm gonna extract the brain.

546
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,642
- Oh, that's just rude.
- Damn it.

547
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,647
<i>The preliminary
reports have been confirmed.</i>

548
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,196
<i>Children are for some reason
violently attacking their parents</i>

549
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,398
<i>in front of Fort Chicken Elementary.</i>

550
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,780
<i>We have reports of victims
around the city.</i>

551
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,112
<i>Authorities have no idea
what is going on.</i>

552
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,200
<i>Stay inside, stay in your cars,
do not go out...</i>

553
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:44,422
<i>Dude, this is totally tripping me out.</i>

554
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,216
Are you on shrooms too?

555
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,807
Hey.

556
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:06,023
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd really rather be left alone, Lucy.

557
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,323
Wade, can we please talk?

558
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,400
I don't wanna talk.

559
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,451
I know you don't, but I do.

560
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,202
Why don't you talk
to your boyfriend about it?

561
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,917
Clint and I went to school together.

562
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,416
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

563
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,997
I walked in this morning,

564
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,505
the guy was fucking hitting on you
and you were eating it up.

565
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,757
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

566
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,634
You can't even deny it. Deny it.

567
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,967
Clint and I were just talking.

568
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,307
And I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I didn't mean to.

569
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,481
- Oh.
- Look, I'm sorry.

570
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,026
I know neither of us thought
this was how the day was gonna go

571
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,729
- when we woke up this morning.
- No, we didn't.

572
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,656
I thought today was gonna go
way different than this.

573
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,361
You have no idea.
I bought you a ring yesterday, Lucy.

574
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:04,332
Then I walk in and I see you laughing
and smiling at that little asshole.

575
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,121
And you know what I thought?

576
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,711
I thought, "Wow,
she looks so pretty when she smiles.

577
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,716
"How come she never smiles at me
like that?"

578
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,263
I'll talk to you later, Lucy.

579
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,190
And go fuck yourself.

580
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,661
Prognosis is not good.

581
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:46,749
As you can see, most of the grey
and white matter has been...

582
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,462
Rebekka, quiet please.

583
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,589
Most of the grey and white matter
has been severely infected.

584
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:57,093
It's showing the beginning stages
of necrosis and decomposition.

585
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,845
All these black areas
are basically dead.

586
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,474
I mean, they can run, jump, eat,
but they're not human anymore.

587
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:07,399
- Not really.
- Once again, how do you know all this?

588
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:12,024
I learned all about the brain when I had
a 6" spike lodged in my skull as a child.

589
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,572
Which is the reason why,
you may have noticed,

590
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,445
sometimes I use the wrong rowboat.

591
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,448
- Word.
- Word.

592
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,581
Now, bacteria can't cross
the blood brain barrier.

593
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,585
So I'm thinking
this is more likely a virus.

594
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,830
What kind of virus would do that?

595
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,752
A pretty nasty one.

596
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,551
Calvin said Shelly Lanker
was the first to bite.

597
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,048
- Right?
- Yeah.

598
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,132
What about Clint and Tamra?
All it did was make them sick.

599
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,137
I have a theory about this.

600
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,514
Hold on a moment.

601
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,685
- Tamra?
- Yeah?

602
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,358
- Have you achieved menses?
- What?

603
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,273
No, he's...

604
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,900
...asking you
if you've had your period yet.

605
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,321
- Um, I really don't wanna say.
- You wear a bra, right?

606
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,369
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

607
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,036
I gave you an A in sex ed, Tamra.

608
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,868
Little disappointed
you don't know what menses are.

609
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,544
Why is sex ed always taught

610
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,373
- by the creepiest teacher?
- Clint, quiet please.

611
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,130
It seems the virus is susceptible
to androgens.

612
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,213
The pre-pubescent body
has testosterone and oestrogen,

613
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,640
but at puberty the body's glands
create a feedback cycle

614
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,185
- that increases gonadotropins...
- What are you trying to say?

615
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,639
Talk like a person. Please?

616
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:35,024
The virus is only dangerous
if you haven't gone through puberty.

617
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,166
- What's going on? How'd they do that?
- Everyone stay calm.

618
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,370
Calvin. Oh, shit. Calvin.

619
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,126
- Calvin.
- Over here, guys.

620
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,082
Calvin? Wake up. Wake up.

621
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,792
- Calvin.
- Quit slapping me.

622
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,048
He's diabetic. He needs to eat.

623
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,346
We need to get him a candy bar
or a soda.

624
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,924
Wade, do you have any snack bars
or something?

625
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,102
- I got creatine powder.
- He needs something with sugar.

626
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,599
This body is a no-carb zone.

627
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,227
What was that?

628
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,481
Probably one of the demented children
that's been trying to murder us all day.

629
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,107
It's coming from over there.

630
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,075
- They're in the boiler room.
- They can't be.

631
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,619
I've checked all these doors.
They're locked.

632
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,795
Oh, my God. They have keys?

633
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,876
You said they couldn't do stuff
like that.

634
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,463
They're gonna get in.
We're all going to die.

635
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,765
This can't be the end.
I'm not published.

636
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,434
Wade, I thought about it
and I can't marry you.

637
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,099
- Jesus, it's the fucking janitor.
- Hitachi?

638
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,935
- What are you doing here?
- The lights are out.

639
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,693
- We gotta move.
- Go.

640
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,570
Come on!

641
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,953
Move it, move it.

642
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,251
Watch your step.

643
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,292
What the hell?

644
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,253
- You live down here?
- Yes.

645
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,010
- Where are we?
- Oh, my God.

646
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,590
We have a kid who needs help.
He's diabetic. Do you have any food?

647
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,805
Seaweed.

648
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,516
I'm afraid that won't work. No.

649
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,477
The microwave.

650
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,905
<i>This is
the emergency broadcast system</i>

651
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,699
<i>for the township of Fort Chicken,
Illinois.</i>

652
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,402
<i>Effective immediately,</i>

653
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,080
<i>the mayor of Fort Chicken has
announced mandatory evacuations</i>

654
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,533
<i>of neighbourhoods

00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:58,042
<i>Authorities are reporting the spread

656
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,622
<i>Reports say...</i>

657
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,134
We're alone.

658
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,926
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

659
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:30,738
No. No, we're not. There's a snack
machine in the teacher's lounge, right?

660
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,414
- Yeah.
- How many people can fit in your truck?

661
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:38,745
Told you, it's a dual real wheel.
Dual real... It's a dual real whe...

662
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,921
- Probably eight.
- Where are the keys?

663
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,873
- With my jacket.
- Which is where?

664
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:47,132
Back in the teachers' lounge
which is impossible to get to.

665
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,599
Where does that lead?

666
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,565
Conditioning of air.

667
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,609
So this duct takes us
to the teacher's lounge?

668
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,528
We take the duct to the lounge.

669
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,982
We get something from the vending
machine and grab Wade's keys.

670
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,820
We get back here, fix Calvin up
and take the duct to the parking lot.

671
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,826
If we're near the office
we should grab our phones too.

672
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,160
But who's going up into that thing?
Who's teensy, weensy enough to fit...?

673
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,958
Me? No, no, no.

674
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,964
No, I... No, I definitely don't
do brave stuff.

675
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,717
I've never even been camping.
I have a blog.

676
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:35,677
I get excited about Apple products.
That's what I'm comfortable with.

677
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,473
Here we go.

678
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:51,572
By letting you guard this,
I'm trusting you with my entire life.

679
00:51:55,321 --> 00:52:00,828
Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot.

680
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,673
- It'll protect you.
- Thanks, Tamra.

681
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:37,572
<i>Remember,
Clint. If you fail, we're all gonna die.</i>

682
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,913
<i>I appreciate the update.</i>

683
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:48,041
- You're doing great. Just trust yourself.
- Yeah, and your cock is girthy too.

684
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,875
- <i>Fuck off, Wade.</i>
- You fuck off.

685
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,677
Both of you out it out.

686
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,926
You know who you sound like?
You sound like your students.

687
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,974
<i>I don't have students.
I'm not a teacher. I'm a writer.</i>

688
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,019
Yeah, self-published, writer.
I'm self-published too.

689
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,097
Doug, you wanna buy my book?

690
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,650
There are no words on this.

691
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,354
- You know what? I'm going to...
- Lucy, what are you doing?

692
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,821
- No. No, you are not...
- You can't do anything to stop me!

693
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,529
If I wanna go in the fucking
air-conditioning duct, I'll go.

694
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,911
I'm just gonna die anyway
just like the rest of you assholes.

695
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,585
So maybe I'm gonna try
and do something brave.

696
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:30,007
A final pointless gesture of kindness
in this cruel shitty world

697
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:35,429
that likes taking gestures of kindness
and shitting and peeing on them.

698
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,008
You know what else? Since you're
all gonna be dead soon anyway,

699
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,559
I should tell you

700
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,229
I hate every single one of you.

701
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,582
It's me. It's me! I'm coming with you
whether you like it or not, so shut up.

702
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,125
OK.

703
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,957
This makes me so nervous.

704
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,966
He paces like this late at night
when he's on the phone too.

705
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,668
It's just ridiculous.

706
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:15,298
How do you know that?

707
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,465
You'd better not let anything
happen to her.

708
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,519
That's funny. I was thinking of letting
really bad things happen to her.

709
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:26,313
I will squeeze up in there
and slap your dick off.

710
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,569
- Thanks for coming to help me.
- No problem.

711
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,921
I think this is it.

712
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,685
Careful.

713
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:50,366
- Oh. Um, do you have a dollar?
- Yeah.

714
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,381
There's Wade's keys.

715
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,178
I'm gonna go check and see
if there's a phone.

716
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,631
- No, wait for me.
- No, we don't have time.

717
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,183
You get the candy bar.
I'm gonna get a phone.

718
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,885
OK, be careful.

719
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,808
Come on.

720
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,110
Come on.

721
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,074
Shit.

722
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,693
- Clint, get in! Get in!
- I'm working on it. Come on.

723
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,698
Hurry up!

724
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,089
We're not gonna make it.
Go left.

725
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,349
Guys, head's up.

726
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,220
They did it.

727
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,556
Hey, look what we got for you.

728
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,574
Put it back, put it back.

729
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,532
The desk! The desk!

730
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,366
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

731
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,673
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

732
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,631
- Miss Stanford.
- Jesus.

733
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,055
After the fifth half-eaten corpse
you see,

734
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,684
it's still horrifying,
but somehow slightly less horrifying.

735
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,610
Shit.

736
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,444
Look out. They're in the vents.
They're heading your way.

737
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,828
- I'll get the locks.
- OK.

738
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,122
- More stuff. Come on.
- Here.

739
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,995
- Here.
- Let's go. Come on.

740
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,002
- Keep it coming.
- Here.

741
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,627
Straps.

742
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,889
Come on.

743
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,592
Got it.

744
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,607
Why do they pound?
What does the pounding accomplish?

745
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,902
<i>Are you guys OK?</i>

746
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,446
Yeah, we're all good.
Thanks for the heads-up.

747
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,490
We're not all good.
We are trapped in here.

748
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,864
Oh, God, those kids
are gonna come in here.

749
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,446
- They're gonna rip us to shreds.
- We get it.

750
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,749
You've got to calm down right now.

751
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,956
- I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Calm.

752
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,544
I'm fine.

753
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,126
- I'm calm.
- OK. Thank you.

754
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,544
Calm down.

755
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,466
I'm calm!

756
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,719
I already said I was calm!

757
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,596
This is like the worst Monday ever.

758
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,926
This probably isn't
the greatest timing,

759
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,721
but I have a confession to make.

760
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,470
When I saw you this morning,
I was only pretending to be surprised.

761
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,679
I knew you taught here.

762
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,693
Really?

763
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:16,241
Yeah, I've been pretty depressed lately
and I just wanted to see you.

764
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,988
It's stupid. We haven't had
a conversation in like 15 years.

765
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,416
I guess I kind of missed you somehow.

766
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,918
- Sorry, that's so creepy.
- No, it's not creepy.

767
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,748
I'm just surprised.

768
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:36,463
I heard you were in New York
following your dream being a writer.

769
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:43,473
I have another confession to make.

770
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:48,224
Remember when I said
I wasn't a teacher?

771
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,892
That was a lie too.

772
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,541
That's what I was doing in New York.

773
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,860
Really?

774
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:03,239
Yeah. Yeah, I've been teaching
first grade for two years.

775
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:11,130
I mean, I thought I would have free time
to write, um, on my free time,

776
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,299
but as it turns out
there is no free time.

777
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,843
Teaching is the hardest job
in the world.

778
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,837
And I would...

779
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,722
...look out at the kids in my class

780
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,473
and I found myself
getting jealous of them.

781
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,814
They have the whole world
ahead of them.

782
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,642
Their whole lives ahead of them.

783
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,354
They have all these opportunities
that have already passed me by.

784
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,945
What?

785
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:45,247
Nothing. I was gonna tell you, you were
wrong, but you sort of have a point.

786
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:48,621
Oh, that's super comforting. Thanks.

787
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,094
Oh.

788
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,809
- I probably shouldn't have done that.
- I know. I know.

789
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,315
I can't just barge into your life
like that.

790
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,362
Even if I do kind of
hate your boyfriend.

791
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,031
Just need a bottle of wine.

792
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:26,238
Right? One of those backpacks
must have some beer in it.

793
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,416
Definitely Ritalin.
Probably Adderall too.

794
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,754
Wait.

795
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,840
There's still so much I haven't done.

796
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:46,847
Like... Like I've also wanted
to fire an Uzi. I don't know.

797
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,103
I wanted a bunny.

798
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,773
I always wanted a bunny growing up
and never got one.

799
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,975
You know what I want?

800
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,439
I wanna know why my brother-in-law
makes ten times what I do.

801
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,775
You know what he does for a living?

802
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,111
He makes giant foam fingers
for football games.

803
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:10,074
You tell people you're a teacher
and they look at you like

804
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,500
you must've wanted
to do something else.

805
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,671
It's like, "Fuck you, man.
I'm raising your kids."

806
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,795
I love my job.

807
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,918
- And teachers deserve respect.
- Yeah.

808
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,928
I'm sorry that it took me until today
to realise this,

809
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,353
but I really actually like you guys.

810
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,978
I always wanted to have sex
with a prostitute who was non-white.

811
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,778
Is anybody there?

812
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,076
Wade?

813
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:50,789
- <i>Hey. You OK?</i>
- Yeah.

814
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:54,542
<i>Hey. Listen, Lucy, about today...</i>

815
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,870
Wade, we can talk about this
another time.

816
01:05:57,078 --> 01:06:00,503
- Let's not talk about this now.
- <i>No, I wanna talk about it.</i>

817
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:05,304
<i>Lucy, I love you and I'm so sorry
that I was an asshole today.</i>

818
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,757
Clint's not listening, is he?

819
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,719
- No, it's just me.
<i>- Good.</i>

820
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,852
<i>Because... Look, I know you're
not crazy about your hometown.</i>

821
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,730
And this is not what you pictured
growing up

822
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,982
that you'd be dating
some PE teacher.

823
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,738
<i>I guess I just got jealous that
some fancy-pants New York writer</i>

824
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,410
- <i>was gonna swoop in...</i>
- No, wait.

825
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,739
<i>I know you've always wanted
to live there.</i>

826
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,995
<i>- I don't know that that's something...</i>
- Wade, it's Clint.

827
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,704
<i>- Damn it, put Lucy back on.</i>
- I'm not a fancy writer from New York.

828
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,711
I'm a bad writer from Fort Chicken.
I live with my mum.

829
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,667
I sleep in a bed I used to pee in.

830
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,843
You're a handsome guy
who Lucy likes,

831
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,548
and if you guys are meant
to be together I'm all for it.

832
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,804
I'm sorry I got in the way.

833
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,520
You really think I'm a handsome guy?

834
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,857
<i>Listen. Thanks, Clint.</i>

835
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,405
Just...

836
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,238
Can you put Lucy back on, please?

837
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,530
<i>Wade, I love you, but I...</i>

838
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,490
- <i>Wade, it's me again.</i>
- Goddamnit!

839
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,200
I have an idea. Listen up.

840
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,127
Oh, dear lord.

841
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,258
Is the coast clear?

842
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,970
If by clear you mean
full of terrifying imagery

843
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,927
that will take me years of therapy
to unsee.

844
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,478
Hey.

845
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,647
Hey, sweetie.

846
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,731
OK, go for it.

847
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:48,907
Look, drugs. You hungry for drugs?
Want some Ritalin? Some Adderall?

848
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,533
Do you remember how
in that movie <i>Commando,</i>

849
01:07:54,737 --> 01:08:00,039
and every other eighties action film
there was that suiting-up montage?

850
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,666
- Well, this is that scene.
- Yeah.

851
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:07,216
Now, they've got us outnumbered,
outgunned and out...

852
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,755
...numbered, but there's one thing
we have that they don't.

853
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,136
The drive to win.

854
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,431
They seem very driven to me.

855
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,479
We need to turn this room inside out.

856
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,650
Look under every shelf,
inside every box,

857
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:26,941
gather anything you
or someone else could use.

858
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:31,195
We've got to collect everything.
We've gotta have bats and tools

859
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,026
and ropes and pointy things.

860
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:37,114
Anything that has a spike on it,
anything that's serrated.

861
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,826
We're not playing defence anymore.
Darn fourth graders.

862
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,128
You can forget about them.
They're gone.

863
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:46,548
Forget who you think
you're fighting. We're going to war.

864
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:49,251
I used to be a champion.

865
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:53,214
I'm a little fatter now,
I'm a little balder too,

866
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,674
but I've still got that spirit.

867
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,011
And they are not taking
that away from me.

868
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,595
Ever.

869
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:05,267
I've played dodgeball a million times
with these little shits.

870
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,354
Go for the face. It's their weak spot.

871
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:14,276
Huh. I guess they really can
overdose on that stuff.

872
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,930
<i>OK,
looks like the Adderall did the job.</i>

873
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,910
<i>They should be knocked out
for a while.</i>

874
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,333
When we say go,
rendezvous in the main hall,

875
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:27,334
<i>head straight for the back door, then
haul ass to Wade's truck. Ready?</i>

876
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,791
We are good to go. We can do this.

877
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:34,721
Between us we've got
18 regional-championship trophies,

878
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:39,051
three MVPs,
and one state-championship ring.

879
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,885
<i>Wade, those are all your awards.</i>

880
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,222
Exactly, and I'm a part of this team.

881
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,057
That makes us all champions.

882
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,812
Now, are we ready?

883
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,314
- Ready.
- Ready.

884
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,237
- I'm gay.
- I fucking knew it.

885
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,110
Hitachi, you ready?

886
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,860
Yes, Hitachi ready to die.

887
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:00,948
My father told me story once.
Story of frog and caterpillar.

888
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:06,207
Story goes, it was winter and frog
is sitting on snow-covered branch.

889
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,539
The frog saw the caterpillar
and asked...

890
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,795
OK, this story is taking way too long.
Let's play some dodgeball.

891
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,060
Hey, guys.

892
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,666
OK, I got this.

893
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:53,208
Come on.

894
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,762
Fuck, yeah. Let's go.

895
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,928
Go, go. Move it.

896
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,226
- Let's go.
- OK. Go, go, go.

897
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,640
Damn it, I'm out of balls.

898
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,241
Oh, shit.

899
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,506
Fuck.

900
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,511
Rock 'n' roll!

901
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,783
Get back.

902
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,157
- Lucy? Where's Lucy?
- I don't know.

903
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,547
Come on. Come on.

904
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,772
You motherfuckers!

905
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,743
- Thanks.
- Take me to Subway some time.

906
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,416
- Lucy.
- OK. OK.

907
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,870
Get behind me. Get back.

908
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:37,584
Get back. Get back.

909
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,385
Give me the keys.

910
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,888
- Get those kids to the truck.
- Go, go, go.

911
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,475
Get off him!

912
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,773
Come on, let's go.

913
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,147
He's behind us.

914
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:07,406
Get in. Get in.

915
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,408
Hey, Danielle Steel.

916
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,046
Take care of her.

917
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,167
No!

918
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,386
- No, no, no, Lucy. No.
- No. Wade.

919
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,684
- No, no, no. Hang on, Lucy. Lucy, no.
- Wade! No! No!

920
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,408
No!

921
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,418
No, we gotta go. We gotta go. Go.

922
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,916
- Get in.
- Oh, my God.

923
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,498
Oh, God.

924
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,882
Wade?

925
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,304
No!

926
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,364
Lucy, I'm sorry.

927
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,749
What about these kids' parents?

928
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,253
What about our parents?

929
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,937
Shit.

930
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,815
- What?
- What?

931
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,608
We're almost empty.

932
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,615
Everybody hold on!

933
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,874
Must have been in the back
the whole time.

934
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,606
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

935
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,135
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

936
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,468
Ram him!

937
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,730
Eat a cock.

938
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,580
Well, that ought to do it.

939
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,465
Guys, up ahead. It's Danville.

940
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,548
At least it's not Fort Chicken.

941
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,526
Oh, no.

942
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,445
Jesus.

943
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,498
They got out.

944
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,375
Well, I'd feel worse

945
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:47,422
if all these dead people
weren't from fucking Danville.

946
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:57,799
Well, now we're really out of gas.

947
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,106
Everybody stay close.

948
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,325
- Wait. Where's Doug?
- There he is.

949
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:25,368
- Doug, come on.
- No, you come here.

950
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,088
They're everywhere.

951
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,100
That's Indiana.

952
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,933
That's Ohio.

953
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,855
It's an epidemic.

954
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,024
Actually the correct term
is pandemic.

955
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,694
A pandemic covers
a much wider geographical...

956
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,817
That's the Fort Chicken factory.

957
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:00,991
Is there anything from that factory
served in the school cafeteria?

958
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,572
Chicken nuggets.

959
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,578
Of course. A food-borne virus.

960
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:08,912
If I could get homing endonucleases,
each one targeting a different specific...

961
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,417
You're doing it again.
You're doing it again.

962
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,545
Rebekka, quiet please.

963
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,127
OK, see, that time
I was actually talking.

964
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:20,010
If we could isolate the virus
and kill it while preserving the capsid...

965
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:23,809
- Please dumb it down.
- If I could find one of the nuggets,

966
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,432
maybe I could make a vaccine
for the virus.

967
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,565
Everybody look for an open door.

968
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:43,199
- Guys, hurry up. Get in here.
- Go, go, go.

969
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,663
Everyone OK?

970
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:55,833
OK, we're here. We made it.

971
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:58,214
Oh, I fucking hate Danville so much.

972
01:19:58,419 --> 01:19:59,921
Everyone stick together.

973
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:07,011
I can't... I can't see anything.

974
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,388
Someone find a li...

975
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,271
- It's me.
- Jesus.

976
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,944
These things are great.

977
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,526
Let's go this way.

978
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,824
Oh, my God.
Those are the nuggets.

979
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,783
You'll come in handy, little one.

980
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:35,248
Nugget out of here.
Nugget out... Nugget out of here.

981
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,464
OK. Come on.

982
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:03,321
Come on.

983
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,875
Where are we?

984
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,309
- I hate to say it, guys.
- Oh, shit.

985
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:38,861
Oh, shit.

986
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,886
Somebody order a bad-ass?

987
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,058
Wade!

988
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,554
Now, Hitachi.

989
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,356
Now the time for the frog
to fuck the caterpillar?

990
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:17,809
Whatever, Hitachi.

991
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:24,573
- They're coming.
- Let's go!

992
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:28,243
Get in the van!
Let's go. Move, move, move!

993
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,620
I thought you were dead.

994
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:33,540
It was just half time, baby.

995
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:37,582
Go to the van! Run! Run! Run!

996
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:01,651
Hurry! Let's go. We can make it.

997
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,730
Help me wedge this in here.

998
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,034
Clint, go. Get out of here.

999
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:16,162
- Kids, kids, go, go, go.
- Oh, my God.

1000
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,960
Is this one of those
really intense drug interventions?
