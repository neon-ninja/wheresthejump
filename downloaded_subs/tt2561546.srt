1
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,705
<i>In the spring of 1946,</i>

2
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:41,293
<i>in the small town of Texarkana,
on the Texas-Arkansas border,</i>

3
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:44,145
<i>a series of horrific murders
were committed</i>

4
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,800
<i>by a masked assailant known
only as "The Phantom Killer."</i>

5
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:53,955
<i>For three harrowing months, the Phantom
stalked the back roads of Texarkana,</i>

6
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:58,106
<i>following young couples
looking for privacy to isolated areas,</i>

7
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:01,563
<i>where their screams for help
would go unanswered.</i>

8
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:05,967
<i>Though several arrests were made
in connection with the brutal slayings,</i>

9
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,369
<i>which ended as suddenly as they began,</i>

10
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,706
<i>the killer's identity
was never confirmed.</i>

11
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:15,143
<i>Indeed, many people who lived
through that nightmare time</i>

12
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:18,980
<i>believed the Phantom
spent the rest of his days free,</i>

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,186
<i>walking the streets of Texarkana
quietly, anonymously,</i>

14
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,577
<i>until his assumed death.</i>

15
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,893
<i>In 1976, a film inspired by the infamous
Moonlight Murders was released.</i>

16
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:35,363
<i>Every year, on Halloween,
The Town That Dreaded Sundown</i>

17
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:38,200
<i>is screened somewhere in Texarkana,</i>

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,467
<i>in tribute to the Phantom's legacy
of death and blood.</i>

19
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,142
<i>Today, Texarkana
is a place haunted by its past,</i>

20
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,179
<i>defined by a mystery
that was never solved,</i>

21
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,616
<i>and a tragedy
that could never be forgotten.</i>

22
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:59,351
<i>The following happened
in Texarkana last year.</i>

23
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:24,941
<i>Sammy! Sammy!</i>

24
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:30,150
You're not enjoying this, are you?

25
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,588
Oh, I just don't like
these kinds of films so much.

26
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,155
Why didn't you say so?

27
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,093
We can go.

28
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,195
Really? Do you mean it?

29
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,943
<i>Stop it!</i>

30
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,415
I mean, man, the last time I saw
this movie was when I was, like, 12.

31
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,456
God bless you and the Texarkana
Fellowship Church invites you

32
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:11,223
to stop the Devil with gospel.

33
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:19,934
Hello, sister.
You take a look at this now.

34
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,271
This is a godless film
that you're watching here.

35
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,574
And I want you to listen
to my broadcast on Friday

36
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:31,177
and come to church on Sunday.
I'll tell you all about it.

37
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:38,620
<i>Welcome back.
This is KYGL, Oldies on the Border.</i>

38
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,822
<i>It's Halloween night,
so if you're sitting at home,</i>

39
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:44,793
<i>waiting for the trick-or-treaters to come by,
we'll keep you company with our usual...</i>

40
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,962
Real people died, you know, young man.

41
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:51,532
Real people died.
That's right. That's right.

42
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:56,150
It's a godless film and I want to see you
on Sunday. We welcome you.

43
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:01,042
That's good. You leave.
This is a godless film.

44
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,531
It's good that you're leavin'.

45
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,209
What?

46
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,779
I'm just having a good time
with you, Jami.

47
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:14,048
The only reason I play football
is to get a scholarship and go to SMU.

48
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,850
Yeah?

49
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,651
And how about you? Where'd you apply?

50
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:23,557
You did apply, right?
You're, like, super smart.

51
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,296
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
I applied to UT Austin,

52
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:32,000
NYU, and Cal State.

53
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,936
Wow. That's impressive.

54
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:37,472
Oh, I probably won't get in,
but, you know, aim high.

55
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:39,706
You should.

56
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,847
My dad used to write
for the Gazette, actually.

57
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:47,916
My grandma says it's in my blood, so...

58
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,852
Even though no one reads it,
I like writing for the paper.

59
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,755
I could do that from here
and stay close to my grandma.

60
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,923
- If I don't get in.
- Right.

61
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,795
Well, I'm glad you finally said yes.

62
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,898
Me, too.

63
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,097
- Wait.
- What?

64
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:33,595
Did I... did I do something wrong?

65
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,969
No.

66
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,042
What the hell is he doing?

67
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,709
He's just a Peeping Tom.
He's not gonna do anything.

68
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,044
Corey, we don't know that.

69
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,850
But look.

70
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,004
See?

71
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,544
He just wanted a show.

72
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,791
He's just some asshole
from the drive-in.

73
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:10,431
Let's just go, though. Is that okay?

74
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,194
Yeah.

75
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,538
- Get out of the car.
- Don't, Jami. Stay in the car.

76
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:21,642
Get out of the fucking car
or I'll shoot her in the face.

77
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:38,687
Do your momma and daddy know
where you were tonight, boy?

78
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:40,963
The movie. Yes.

79
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,365
Well, what about yours?

80
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,268
They're dead.

81
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,306
Take your pants off.

82
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,910
- What?
- Take off your fucking pants.

83
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,413
Corey, just do it.

84
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:01,216
Okay, all right.

85
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,486
- Come on, man.
- Get down on the fuckin' ground.

86
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:09,061
- Corey.
- Okay. All right, I am.

87
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,327
I'm not gonna run anywhere.

88
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,909
Now... Now, please, can...

89
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,298
can you just let her go?

90
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,367
No.

91
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:21,071
Please don't kill him.

92
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,737
You.

93
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,727
Turn around. Do not look back.

94
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,083
All right, if you want money,
I can get you money.

95
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,118
- I don't want money.
- What do you want?

96
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:39,622
I said don't look back.

97
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,824
What are you doing?
What are... What are you...

98
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,492
- Shut the fuck up!
- What are you doin'?

99
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:48,029
- Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up!
- What are you doing?

100
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,739
- What the fuck are you doin'...
- Corey!

101
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:56,069
- Please, no! No, please!
- No!

102
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:59,060
Please.

103
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,124
No.

104
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,423
You looked.

105
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,925
This is for Mary.

106
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,196
Make them remember.

107
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:07,277
<i>What are you doing?
No, please, don't hurt me.</i>

108
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,431
- Who is that?
- What?

109
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:57,037
Oh, no. Please don't hurt me.

110
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:03,230
<i>This is Texarkana 911.
What is your emergency?</i>

111
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,635
<i>We're at the Twin Star Drive-In.
We need an ambulance and the police.</i>

112
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,073
<i>Is someone injured?</i>

113
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:13,507
<i>Yes. A girl and maybe her boyfriend,
I don't know. She is hysterical.</i>

114
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,627
<i>All right. All right.</i>

115
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:21,145
He was on top of me.
He could have killed me, but he didn't.

116
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,484
You say the Phantom told you something?

117
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:28,254
I don't know why, but he said
he was doin' it for someone named Mary.

118
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,493
- Were you drinkin'? Doin' any drugs?
- No.

119
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:34,495
Did the doctors find any drugs in her?

120
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:39,866
Well, as a precaution, we're gonna
have someone in front of your house.

121
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,800
I... I can do that.

122
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,972
- Thank you.
- Until we get some more information,

123
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:51,245
Jami, we'd like to ask you not to discuss
any of this with the press.

124
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:55,050
They've been all over this story,
as you can imagine.

125
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:04,292
<i>Once again, for those just joining us,
24 hours after the shocking</i>

126
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:08,162
<i>Phantom-inspired murder
of a 17-year-old high school student,</i>

127
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,130
<i>no arrests have been made.</i>

128
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,703
<i>It is unreasonable to try and find meaning
in this grotesque and godless crime,</i>

129
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:19,106
<i>but that is exactly
what we must do as a community.</i>

130
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,943
<i>Like a lost reel
from The Town That Dreaded Sundown,</i>

131
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:26,180
<i>the attack on Halloween night took place
in a secluded, wooded cul-de-sac,</i>

132
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,754
<i>just off Highway 6, an area
that used to be called Lovers' Lane.</i>

133
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,367
Grandma, do you remember
anything about the murders?

134
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:50,905
Oh, dear girl, barely.
Just what I heard later.

135
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:54,240
You know, your... great-grandpa
and your great-grandma

136
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,911
lived in this house when it happened.

137
00:12:57,011 --> 00:13:00,848
I remember my momma once said
that it was like the town was being tested

138
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,383
and nobody knew why.

139
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,320
Even the grown-ups were scared.

140
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,357
He was the bogeyman, they said.

141
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:14,995
Can't catch the bogeyman.
Can't kill the bogeyman.

142
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:18,668
His father is the devil
and his mother is a whore.

143
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:24,205
You know, before that summer,

144
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,641
everybody would leave
their doors unlocked.

145
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,314
And after the summer,
you saw a stranger,

146
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:36,350
you wouldn't wave hello.
You'd just cross the street.

147
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,086
And what about when they made the movie?

148
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:43,159
- What about it?
- Were people still afraid?

149
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,928
The Phantom? No, that faded.

150
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:51,799
Nobody knew exactly
who he was or what he did,

151
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,169
just that... he'd lived in this town

152
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:59,340
and attacked some teenagers
on Lovers' Lane.

153
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,944
And then the movie brought it all back.

154
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,428
This is for Mary.

155
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,036
<i>Humility, devotion, sacrifice.</i>

156
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,181
Mr. Holland...

157
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,316
I just wanted you to know
that he was so brave.

158
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,451
You left my baby boy!

159
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,020
- Margaret.
- You slut!

160
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,722
- Margaret.
- You slut! You left him!

161
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,124
It won't bring him back.

162
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:33,293
- You left my baby boy!
- It won't...

163
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,829
I want my baby!

164
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,631
Given what you've been through,

165
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:42,169
I'd like to prescribe a mild
anti-anxiety medication to help you...

166
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,672
No, ma'am. No, thank you.

167
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:47,305
I've spent the last seven years
on all different kinds of medication

168
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:51,211
after my parents passed away.
I'm not interested in anything like that.

169
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:56,063
In your file I read
that you applied to colleges.

170
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:59,070
- To study...
- Creative writing.

171
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,416
I'm not sure it's something
I'm ready for, or made for that,

172
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:04,928
and leaving town... I...

173
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,860
I don't want to. Especially not now.

174
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,531
What about these dreams
you've been having?

175
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:15,870
- What do you think they're about?
- About Corey.

176
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,207
Well,

177
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,679
Corey asked me out and I was flattered.

178
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,281
I don't get asked out all that much.

179
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,119
So I just wanted to show him that...

180
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,223
I...

181
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,260
That I was...

182
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,966
- Grateful?
- Yeah.

183
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,062
So...

184
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:50,266
when he suggested
that we leave the movie,

185
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:51,939
I thought we could go someplace.

186
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,376
And even if we just kissed
for a little while, he would like me more.

187
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,107
You didn't do anything wrong, Jami.

188
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,578
He was just a really good person.

189
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:14,498
He was just a really good person
and he didn't deserve that.

190
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,799
He tried to protect me.

191
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,361
Jami.

192
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:26,073
Try writing about this.

193
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,439
It might help you find a way through it.

194
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,955
Baby!

195
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,941
Glad you made it home safe, baby!

196
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:02,732
Yes!

197
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:13,588
Oh, baby. I'm sore. I need a break.

198
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,424
<i>...four in a row for you on KYGL.</i>

199
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,860
There's a machine by the stairs.

200
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,729
If they got cookies,
get me some cookies.

201
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,665
I need the sugar.

202
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,500
I love you, baby.

203
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,886
I love you, baby.

204
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:44,720
Hey, knock when you come back.
So I know it's you.

205
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,685
Help me! Help!

206
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,746
Help!

207
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,459
No!

208
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,652
Hello?

209
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:05,025
<i>I'm going to do it again and again
until you make them remember.</i>

210
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,945
I think I need to tell someone.

211
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,632
Well, you just did. Me.

212
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,801
I mean, like a reporter
at the news or something.

213
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:16,250
He said he was gonna do it again,
and if he has a message

214
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,273
and he's using me to get it out,
I have to say something. It's...

215
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:25,680
And he's using you why?
'Cause he likes you?

216
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,252
I don't know.

217
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:37,900
Miss Lerner, I promise you...

218
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,362
we will investigate this. I will personally
make sure that it's investigated.

219
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,499
Thank you.

220
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,871
I just don't understand
why he thinks we deserve this.

221
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,510
Well...

222
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,543
I'll tell you what,
I wasn't born in Texarkana,

223
00:22:56,643 --> 00:23:00,447
but I've been around here
long enough to know one thing...

224
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,683
And that's that just about everyone
around here

225
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:05,987
has got some kind of blood
on their hands.

226
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,727
<i>Three weeks after the shocking death
of high school senior Corey Holland,</i>

227
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:18,465
<i>the town of Texarkana has awoken yet again
to another gruesome act of violence.</i>

228
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,567
<i>This time, two people were found dead.</i>

229
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,805
<i>Corporal Daniel Torrens was coming home</i>

230
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:25,922
<i>to spend Thanksgiving
with his girlfriend, Kendra Collins,</i>

231
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:27,357
<i>when they checked into this motel...</i>

232
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:31,011
<i>At a few minutes past midnight,
the couple was attacked and killed,</i>

233
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,747
<i>their bodies mutilated
almost beyond recognition.</i>

234
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,866
<i>A heart full of hate, that'll do it.</i>

235
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:38,619
A soul consumed by vengeance. Sin.

236
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,191
<i>The Sheriff's office has been in contact
with the Texas Rangers</i>

237
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,774
<i>to help with the investigation.</i>

238
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:46,829
<i>But in the meantime,
a Town Hall meeting has been scheduled.</i>

239
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,933
Reverend Cartwright,
will you lead us in a word of prayer?

240
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:03,777
Our Dear Heavenly Father, we ask you
to deliver us through this trial,

241
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:07,614
shield us during this time
of fire and blood,

242
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:10,083
of confusion and despair.

243
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,586
We ask you to lend us
some of your strength

244
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,724
and give it to these fine young men
and women that they may help guide us

245
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,760
through this forest
of fear and darkness...

246
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,089
<i>This town, where I was born,
where I grew up,</i>

247
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:27,196
- <i>is the only place I've ever known.</i>
- Amen.

248
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:34,032
The Mayor's asked us to hold
this forum to give you an update

249
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:36,310
- and hear your concerns.
- Well, an update would be great!

250
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,068
<i>People are saying the Phantom is back.</i>

251
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,997
<i>That after 60 some years he's come back
and that we need to be ready.</i>

252
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:42,716
Ma'am, he'd be 100 years old.

253
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,920
Every time we show that GD movie,
there's a GD party out there!

254
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,321
<i>The Phantom is our dirty secret.</i>

255
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:51,815
That movie will never be shown
in Texarkana again.

256
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:55,796
- Not on the Texas side.
- And not on the Arkansas side, either.

257
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:58,799
And while you're at it, why don't you
tear down that statue of Jim Bowie?

258
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,969
Isn't he holding one of them GD knives?
Why don't you rip that down?

259
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,719
<i>Everyone knows some piece
of the story, but...</i>

260
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:07,486
- <i>the whole truth has been all but buried.</i>
- Oh, We're all so surprised

261
00:25:07,586 --> 00:25:10,911
that the Phantom's back?
Of course he is.

262
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,613
You can't leave a candle
burning in a window for someone

263
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,316
and then be surprised
when he finally shows up!

264
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,852
Amen. Amen, sister, Amen.

265
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:21,922
<i>Most of the people alive back then
are no longer with us.</i>

266
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,523
<i>Or they just don't want to remember.</i>

267
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,560
- Then you shutter the bars.
- <i>But everything comes back.</i>

268
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,763
<i>The past is alive, all around us.</i>

269
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,097
Order!

270
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,737
"Disciples of Evil."
That's what my daddy said.

271
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,886
Hi.

272
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:55,188
The library's paper archives
only go back for 10 years.

273
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,739
They said I should come here if I was
looking for articles in the Gazette

274
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,060
- from the '40s and '50s.
- Stuff about the Phantom?

275
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,498
Yes.

276
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,667
All the best stuff is upstairs.
In the jail.

277
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,390
Listen up!

278
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,681
As of this moment,

279
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:25,722
the Texas Rangers are in charge
of this investigation. Specifically, I am.

280
00:26:25,822 --> 00:26:29,380
They moved everything in here
when they decommissioned the prison.

281
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,291
Now we just use if for storage.

282
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:35,829
All of our archives and files.
It's in here.

283
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,551
Trust me,

284
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:40,300
I understand how you feel right now.

285
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,337
I once had a Texas Ranger
come into my house, and it wasn't easy.

286
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,809
Sparkplug, give us the room.

287
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,613
Now, let's get down to business.

288
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:57,617
I want open, clear lines of communication
between Texas and Arkansas.

289
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,599
One person from each side
reporting directly to me.

290
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:04,224
So are you just casually
interested, or...

291
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:06,193
I don't think we'll figure out
who the Phantom is now

292
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,107
unless we figure out
who he was back then.

293
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,364
- Cool.
- We have two jobs, friends.

294
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,866
To capture this bastard

295
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:16,336
and to keep the good people of Texarkana
from killing each other out of fear.

296
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,572
We are not huntin' a ghost.

297
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:24,043
We are after a flesh and blood,
cold-blooded killer,

298
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,814
who, up to this point,
has not made one mistake.

299
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:30,951
- Due respect, Ranger Morales...
- Call me Lone Wolf.

300
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:33,936
I think very highly of myself,

301
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:36,656
and I've also earned it.

302
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:39,759
Due respect, Lone Wolf,
he was videotaped.

303
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,596
I'd like to see that footage.
Oh, and the movie.

304
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:47,138
Believe it or not, I've never had
the pleasure of seeing it.

305
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:53,341
Everything from 1945 to 1952
is gonna be in here.

306
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,091
You know how that works? The microfiche?

307
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,026
They were gonna throw it out,
and I said, "Hey, why?

308
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,832
"You know, it works. Bring it here."

309
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,738
Well...

310
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:24,949
Well, thanks.

311
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,989
Yeah. Good luck.

312
00:28:57,303 --> 00:29:01,038
Oh, shit, sorry.
You're Jami Lerner, aren't you?

313
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,877
I'm Nick.

314
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,248
I went to Evans High with you.

315
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:11,517
We were in the same chem class.

316
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:12,635
We were?

317
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:15,989
Yeah, you sat in the front to the side.
I sat in the back to the other side.

318
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,894
And when I recognized you, I thought...

319
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:23,960
"Holy shit, that's her,
and I hope she's okay."

320
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:32,180
That's all. I just wanted
to see if you're okay.

321
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:34,741
Yeah, I am.

322
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,844
And... give you this.

323
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:40,780
It's the greatest hits the Gazette
published back when it was happening.

324
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,549
And then they did a retrospective.

325
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:44,539
It's usually $12 for xeroxing,
but you can...

326
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:47,254
Don't worry about it. Just go ahead.

327
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:50,917
Thanks.

328
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,631
Well, I'll just be downstairs,
manning the desk, if you need anything.

329
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,966
<i>From the KYGL on the Border family</i>

330
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:52,585

334
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,922

00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:53,279
<i>"I come and go as I please.
I kill when I please.</i>

337
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:57,149
<i>"You may think I'm a horrible,
sick murderer,</i>

338
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,627
<i>"but I'm not, I love my neighbors.</i>

339
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:04,424
<i>"I wish they would stop
and let my soul rest in peace."</i>

340
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:09,286
"For you see, I am the soul of Texarkana.
I am the reckoning foretold."

341
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:13,566
Look, I can understand
how this can be upsetting,

342
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,970
but it's also most likely a fake.

343
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,272
Well, the Zodiac, he sent
a manifesto to the press and...

344
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:23,076
Yes. And so did the Son of Sam,
and the Axeman of New Orleans,

345
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,778
but to reporters, not teenagers.

346
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:28,214
We all realize it could be
a hoax, Deputy.

347
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:33,023
But until it's 100% confirmed, we will
take it and this young lady seriously.

348
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,722
I want my entire team to hear
what you have to say.

349
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:38,625
If you think it's important,
we think it's important.

350
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,630
Well...

351
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:46,199
I've been researching the original case,
and going through the court transcripts.

352
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,234
Do you know who Benjamin Sewell is?

353
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:51,738
He was a car thief, arrested
in 1946 in Texarkana

354
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:53,473
for possession of a stolen automobile.

355
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:55,975
A lot of people think
that he was the Phantom because...

356
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,743
Well, the killing stopped
once he was arrested.

357
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:01,014
- How long was he in for?
- Thirty years.

358
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,150
And then Benjamin Sewell died,
Ms. Lerner.

359
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,754
Yes, sir. He died last summer.
In a hospital in Fort Worth.

360
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:12,375
I spoke to a nurse that worked at the
hospital, since before Benjamin died...

361
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:14,126
- Come on, we don't have time for this.
- Hold on.

362
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,864
She said a young man used to visit him.
His son, they thought.

363
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:21,134
What if it's him? That the passing
of his father set him off

364
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,839
and he came back here
to finish his father's work?

365
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:31,474
Benjamin Sewell did have a son, Ms. Lerner,
but he died in a bar fight two years ago.

366
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:33,350
He did?

367
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,532
It's all right, Jami.
We went down that same rabbit hole.

368
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:44,624
<i>This is KYGL, Oldies on the Border,
and if you've got us on,</i>

369
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:47,527
<i>you're probably getting ready
for the big football game this weekend.</i>

370
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:51,164
<i>The Texas High Tigers versus
the Arkansas High Razorbacks.</i>

371
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:54,908
<i>It's gonna be a blood match, folks.
But as always...</i>

372
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,176
He said he'd shoot me
if I got any closer.

373
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,780
Well, that's his job.

374
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,326
How'd it go at the station?

375
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:12,218
- Not so well.
- It's no surprise.

376
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:14,554
- Grandma, this is...
- Nick Strain.

377
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:16,722
I went to the same high school as Jami.

378
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,260
- And now?
- I work at the archives. Researcher.

379
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,563
I found you some really cool stuff
from back when they were making the movie.

380
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:25,498
You know, some of those people
are still around.

381
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:29,501
- No college?
- Just making some money first.

382
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,831
- Family?
- Grandma.

383
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:36,008
My parents moved to Denton last year,
so I'm living with some buddies.

384
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,481
- I'll be in in a minute, okay?
- All right.

385
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:46,919
Sorry about that. You want to sit down?

386
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:49,188
You know, they did tons
of research for the movie.

387
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,759
The director and his son.

388
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:56,629
Thanks for bringing me this stuff.

389
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,364
Yeah.

390
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,035
Can I ask why
you're helping me with all this?

391
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:07,059
I always wanted to talk to you.

392
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:12,410
Why didn't you?

393
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:17,654
Didn't think I'd get very far.

394
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,036
I never saw you with a...

395
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:23,623
boyfriend or friends or...
I asked around and...

396
00:35:23,723 --> 00:35:25,742
I was like, "What's her story?"

397
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,929
- Then someone told me about...
- About my parents?

398
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:31,630
Or...

399
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,100
that for the last seven years
I've been totally out of it and...

400
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,904
Both.

401
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:40,656
My parents didn't really move to Denton.

402
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:43,306
I just said that 'cause...

403
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,613
I didn't want your grandma
to think I was this... you know,

404
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,106
basket case.

405
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,586
Which, of course,
now I really seem like one.

406
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,456
Where are they?

407
00:35:56,556 --> 00:36:00,382
Well, my dad killed himself last year.

408
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,873
He was an... an alcoholic, and...

409
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:10,123
my mom... kinda...

410
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:14,646
She just got lost after that.

411
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:20,353
She's at Trans-Allegheny.
Well, it's a loony bin.

412
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:24,476
Oh, hey...

413
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:28,398
they're having a vigil
tonight at the school. For...

414
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:31,115
the soldier and his girlfriend.

415
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,537
And for Corey.

416
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,130
You wanna go?

417
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,238
<i>You don't mean that fellow
they call the Lone Wolf</i>

418
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:49,460
- <i>of the Texas Rangers?</i>
- That's right.

419
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:54,774
<i>Since I'm in charge of this investigation,
things are gonna have to be handled my way.</i>

420
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:59,299
<i>We got a cold-blooded killer here.
A man who nobody sees.</i>

421
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:02,812
<i>A Phantom who... so far
hasn't made any mistakes.</i>

422
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:13,148
<i>What are you doing?
No, please, don't hurt me.</i>

423
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:15,204
<i>Please.</i>

424
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:20,806
I guess it was crazy of me to think
I could help the police,

425
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,875
but I'm gonna keep researching.

426
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,977
Keep writing.

427
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,854
Their stories need to be told, so...

428
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:54,567
- Arrest him.
- On the ground!

429
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,906
He killed Danny.
But I got him. I got his ass!

430
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:05,811
- Jami.
- No! No, Nick...

431
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,346
Wait! No! I need to know!

432
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:47,772
Excuse me. May I, please?

433
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,426
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sheriff Underwood has just informed me

434
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:58,614
that the man who killed Corey Holland,
the man who killed, viciously, that couple,

435
00:39:58,714 --> 00:40:01,032
that man has been shot, I'm told.

436
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:05,371
And I don't know what his condition is,
but I do know that no one else was hurt.

437
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:10,142
And that that, finally, is something
that we can give thanks for.

438
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,979
Reverend Cartwright,

439
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,316
would you please lead us
in a brief prayer of gratitude?

440
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,386
Sweet Heavenly Father,
we have been delivered.

441
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:24,023
We praise the men and women
who have led us through this darkness.

442
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:26,792
Sweet Jesus, thank you for your mercy.

443
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,961
- Amen.
- Amen.

444
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:31,013
Now, we've had a quiet night here.

445
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:34,033
But I do believe
that it would be appropriate

446
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:37,705
for us to have a little music
that we could dance to, so, gentlemen,

447
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:39,305
I'm gonna lead you off.

448
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:42,662
One, two... One, two, three, four.

449
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,991
- What was she doing?
- "A one..."

450
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:02,023
The worst dance moves ever.

451
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:07,413
- Straight home now.
- Yes, sir.

452
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:20,936
It's right here.

453
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:35,528
Remember when we used to come over here
and smoke cigarettes?

454
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,464
Thought we were such hot shit.

455
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,522
So...

456
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,527
So how does this work?

457
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,528
I don't know.

458
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,764
I thought maybe you could...

459
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:14,366
You know.

460
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,334
What?

461
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,471
You know.

462
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,472
Go down there,

463
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,010
and suck it.

464
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,581
Suck it?

465
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:30,199
I don't know. Maybe a little?

466
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,084
What, is it hard?

467
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:36,123
- Yeah. Isn't yours?
- Yeah.

468
00:42:40,256 --> 00:42:41,435
You first.

469
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,029
And then I'll do you.

470
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,863
Maybe we could...

471
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,561
jerk off together.

472
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:53,107
Dude, drive! Come on! Hurry up, come on!

473
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,063
Run, Johnny! Run!

474
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,079
No! No!

475
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:58,817
Hi.

476
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,569
- Who was that guy at the vigil?
- Name's Paul Mason.

477
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:07,532
A freshman over at Texarkana College.

478
00:45:07,632 --> 00:45:08,956
He's a messed up kid but...

479
00:45:09,056 --> 00:45:10,976
- He's not the Phantom?
- No.

480
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:14,613
Some stupid teenager
went out looking to get shot.

481
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,983
Left a suicide note in his dorm room.

482
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,934
But just because he wanted to die
doesn't necessarily mean

483
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:23,597
- he's not the Phantom, right?
- Hell, Jami...

484
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:34,699
I... I did not want
to tell you this but you're...

485
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,071
There was another murder last night.
It was two boys.

486
00:45:39,171 --> 00:45:40,973
We're checking
security cameras at the scene,

487
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:44,579
but it does look like it happened
after Paul Mason was shot.

488
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:54,820
<i>It was Sunday, March 3rd, 1946.</i>

489
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,424
<i>The beginning of a reign of terror
for the people of Texarkana</i>

490
00:45:58,524 --> 00:46:01,245
<i>and surrounding areas
of Arkansas and Texas.</i>

491
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:05,834
Well, that's the most god-awful thing
I've done in a long while.

492
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,134
They asked me if their...

493
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,537
their sons...

494
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:14,900
were dead before
he mutilated their bodies.

495
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,041
I lied.

496
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:21,147
I... told 'em as far as I could tell,

497
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:24,287
they had passed before the worst of it.

498
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:26,359
Maybe they had.

499
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,554
They cried.

500
00:46:28,654 --> 00:46:32,615
These two grown men, I've known 'em...

501
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:34,983
all their lives.

502
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,496
Since they were boys.

503
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:42,033
We catch him, we kill him,
that'll make it better.

504
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,583
- That'll at least bring them peace.
- I agree.

505
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,055
To that end,

506
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:53,977
after our friend kills those kids
with the trombone,

507
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,382
who does he go after next?

508
00:46:56,582 --> 00:47:01,620
In the movie, after the trombone killin',
there's a double homicide at the farmhouse.

509
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,823
Every damn house out here
is a farmhouse.

510
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:09,109
<i>Texarkana looked normal
in the daylight hours</i>

511
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:12,319
<i>but everyone dreaded sundown.</i>

512
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:15,868
Maybe I was wrong, Nick.

513
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:21,473
Maybe there is no connection to the past
and the Phantom is just the bogeyman.

514
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,810
Like my grandma says.

515
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,579
<i>The first time I heard about the Phantom,
I was eight years old.</i>

516
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,056
<i>I was at a sleepover
at my friend Chrissie's house.</i>

517
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:43,006
<i>I called my parents to come pick me up.</i>

518
00:47:46,581 --> 00:47:48,595
And that was the night of the crash.

519
00:47:57,242 --> 00:48:00,713
That night in the woods,
he was on top of me

520
00:48:00,813 --> 00:48:04,316
and I thought, "This is it."

521
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,001
You know, it should have happened
when I was eight years old.

522
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:09,942
It's finally caught up to me now.

523
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,967
<i>Death.</i>

524
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,889
It's following me
and it's only a matter of time.

525
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,254
- I guess I'm a little messed up.
- I don't think you are.

526
00:48:22,354 --> 00:48:25,090
- Yeah, that's just 'cause you are, too.
- Good.

527
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:31,677
- Nick, what are you doing?
- It's okay.

528
00:48:31,777 --> 00:48:33,378
No, it's not okay!

529
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:37,314
- I thought that...
- I can't believe you just did that.

530
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:39,551
Look, I'm sorry,
I just thought that we had this...

531
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:41,920
I need you to get out
of the car right now.

532
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,851
Nick, I mean it! Get out of the car!

533
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,398
Are you serious?

534
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:14,552
Oh, that looks just fine.

535
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:15,921
That's very nice.

536
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:18,957
You got everything now, the scallops?
The potatoes and the ham?

537
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:23,862
Ranger. Hank.

538
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,154
Well, Merry Christmas.

539
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,159
- Merry Christmas, Reverend.
- Merry Christmas, Joe.

540
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,703
Well, what can I do for you gentlemen?

541
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:35,509
Is there a place the three of us
can go and talk, Joe?

542
00:49:42,444 --> 00:49:45,327
I didn't send this e-mail.

543
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:49,754
Well, the FBI traced it
back to you, Joe, so...

544
00:49:50,184 --> 00:49:52,724
Why'd you send it to the girl?
To muddy up the waters?

545
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,194
I don't know what to tell you.

546
00:49:55,294 --> 00:49:58,197
Here's what I think,
I don't think you killed anybody.

547
00:49:58,297 --> 00:50:02,186
But I do believe you sent this message.

548
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:06,172
See, I hear you at night, preachin'.

549
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:08,874
Nothin' much for me to do
in my hotel room, so...

550
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:11,577
I wonder, "Are you doing this
for publicity, or..."

551
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:15,447
He chose that girl to be his herald.

552
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:19,952
His messenger.
He is doing the Lord's work.

553
00:50:20,448 --> 00:50:22,121
He's killin' our kids, Joe.

554
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:26,492
My church is more full
than it has been in years.

555
00:50:26,592 --> 00:50:31,162
People are coming to me
asking for redemption, for salvation.

556
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:33,215
They're scared, Hank.

557
00:50:33,315 --> 00:50:36,118
They want to walk
on the righteous path again.

558
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:39,987
Now, I want to call the Mayor.

559
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,686
And then I want to call my lawyer.

560
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,267
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.
- Merry Christmas.

561
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:54,390
I was wondering if Jami's around.

562
00:50:57,773 --> 00:51:00,315
He's kidding, right?

563
00:51:06,014 --> 00:51:07,988
I'm sorry about what I did.

564
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:12,186
No, I'm sorry. I can't believe
I made you walk home.

565
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:15,181
I took the bus.

566
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:22,127
Hey, I wanted to tell you.

567
00:51:22,227 --> 00:51:25,300
I found out Charles Pierce, Jr.
is alive.

568
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,704
- He's the son of the director of The Town...
- The Town That Dreaded Sundown?

569
00:51:28,804 --> 00:51:31,506
Look, I know it's a long shot, but...

570
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:36,541
I mean, the movie defined Texarkana
just as much as the murders did.

571
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:41,243
Anyway, he lives here, in Texarkana.
Near here, out by the dredge.

572
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:45,020
- You talked to him?
- No, I've been asking around about him.

573
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,442
He does odd jobs for the city,
doesn't even have a cell phone.

574
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,891
But worth a try. Right?

575
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:53,705
- If I can get in touch with him?
- Yeah, definitely.

576
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:57,072
- Thanks.
- All right.

577
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:02,013
This is for you.

578
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:05,884
Nick.

579
00:52:30,265 --> 00:52:32,027
Thank you.

580
00:52:33,966 --> 00:52:38,053
<i>This one's for all the brave men and women
who are out there each and every night</i>

581
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:40,215
<i>patrolling the streets,
doing everything they can...</i>

582
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:44,880
<i>We do not, and I repeat, we do not believe
that Reverend Cartwright is the Phantom.</i>

583
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,216
<i>We have taken Reverend
Joseph Cartwright...</i>

584
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,986
Get me started, Elmer.

585
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:57,787
Every Christmas, Ardele.

586
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:01,129
They don't have you working tonight?

587
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,722
Well, I just arrested one of Texarkana's
most prominent citizens

588
00:53:07,822 --> 00:53:10,585
for sending an e-mail, so...

589
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:14,328
That's enough for tonight.

590
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:22,541
Hank. Hank!

591
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,097
Mark it.

592
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:27,639
Action, Bud.

593
00:56:33,274 --> 00:56:37,680
My daddy was a genius visionary.

594
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,348
Could have been the next Orson Welles
if he'd gone to Hollywood,

595
00:56:40,448 --> 00:56:45,386
but he wanted to stay in Texas
and tell our stories.

596
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:49,624
You know, Texas stories.
Not all that Hollywood bullshit.

597
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:54,495
Oh, that. Yeah, that's pretty cool.

598
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:57,391
Yep. That's the original.

599
00:56:58,096 --> 00:56:59,734
Go ahead and touch it if you want.

600
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,455
- No, thank you, sir.
- Go ahead.

601
00:57:02,555 --> 00:57:06,243
- That's okay. I don't... I don't want to.
- Okay.

602
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:13,882
Mr. Pierce, I'm writing something
about the Phantom,

603
00:57:13,982 --> 00:57:17,762
- about his legacy in our town and...
- Well, I can tell you who the killer is.

604
00:57:18,886 --> 00:57:20,378
Would that be interesting to you?

605
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:24,289
- Sure, yeah.
- Well, all right.

606
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:30,665
Well, my father, when he was doing
his research, he talked to everyone.

607
00:57:30,765 --> 00:57:33,635
Most people believe
that Benjamin Sewell was the Phantom.

608
00:57:33,735 --> 00:57:37,072
No, he wasn't. No, no, no, no.
Sewell was not the killer.

609
00:57:37,172 --> 00:57:38,723
No, they railroaded
that poor son of a bitch.

610
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:40,909
No, the police just wanted
someone to be the killer.

611
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:45,726
- How do you know that for sure?
- How do I know? I don't know.

612
00:57:45,826 --> 00:57:48,072
You can't know.

613
00:57:51,186 --> 00:57:55,276
You know, I'll tell you a story
that my father...

614
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:59,391
- told me about Hank McCreedy.
- Hank McCreedy?

615
00:57:59,591 --> 00:58:03,798
A few days after the last murder
at the Stark farm,

616
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:07,856
the police on the Arkansas side,
they found a body...

617
00:58:07,956 --> 00:58:09,918
all in pieces.

618
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,676
It'd been run over by a train.

619
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:18,179
Now, this is the Arkansas police
who say, "Oh, it's the Phantom.

620
00:58:18,279 --> 00:58:21,282
"He committed suicide." No more Phantom.

621
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:25,220
- Based on what?
- Nothin'. It was based on nothin'.

622
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:30,725
But Hank McCreedy's pregnant wife,
she demands an autopsy.

623
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:32,827
And then it come out.
He wasn't run over.

624
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:35,597
He was stabbed
more than two dozen times,

625
00:58:35,697 --> 00:58:38,008
right next to the tracks.

626
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:41,603
My daddy, he had a theory about that.

627
00:58:41,703 --> 00:58:45,907
He said that the Phantom
killed McCreedy,

628
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:50,678
you know, his last victim,
his final goodbye.

629
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:54,082
And then he hopped
a train to California.

630
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:56,518
Mr. Pierce, I've read everything
there is to read on this.

631
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:59,054
I've never even heard
of this Hank McCreedy.

632
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:00,455
It should have been front-page news.

633
00:59:00,555 --> 00:59:04,559
But while the Arkansas police
were findin' McCreedy,

634
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:07,763
the Texas police,
they were arresting Sewell

635
00:59:07,863 --> 00:59:11,266
and so you got two different camps
each saying they got the Phantom.

636
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:13,144
And what neither of them
is piecing together

637
00:59:13,244 --> 00:59:16,738
is that Sewell was in custody
when McCreedy was killed,

638
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:18,409
proving that neither one
was the Phantom.

639
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:22,377
So Sewell was in jail,

640
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:24,502
and then, did anything
ever come from McCreedy?

641
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,280
Oh, he's dead.

642
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,183
Yep, and dead men don't complain much.

643
00:59:29,283 --> 00:59:32,287
But his pregnant wife, Mary,
she's pissed as shit.

644
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:36,224
- Her name was Mary?
- My daddy tracked her down in 1974.

645
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:38,493
And, oh, she was still bitter.

646
00:59:38,893 --> 00:59:42,964
She said that Texarkana had done
worse than killed her husband.

647
00:59:43,064 --> 00:59:44,833
It had shat on his memory.

648
00:59:44,933 --> 00:59:47,468
And in the process,
it was shitting on her life.

649
00:59:47,568 --> 00:59:49,304
It was shitting on her son's life.

650
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:52,106
Who... you think is the Phantom?

651
00:59:52,206 --> 00:59:55,009
No! No!

652
00:59:56,008 --> 00:59:57,502
Sorry.

653
00:59:57,602 --> 01:00:02,166
Hank McCreedy's dead.
His son is dead. His grandson...

654
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:05,591
is still alive.
That's your Phantom, right there.

655
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:09,052
- You're making this shit up.
- No! Boy, listen to me.

656
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:12,026
I am telling you what I know to be true.

657
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:16,998
That Mary McCreedy did pour poison
about Texarkana into Hank Jr.'s ear.

658
01:00:17,098 --> 01:00:18,967
Hank did the same thing to his son!

659
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:23,122
They did, consciously or unconsciously,
they bred themselves a killer!

660
01:00:24,337 --> 01:00:27,976
Mr. Pierce, do you have
any proof of this being true,

661
01:00:28,076 --> 01:00:30,510
or is this just something
that your father told you?

662
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:46,112
My daddy asked me
to make a sequel to Town,

663
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:52,047
to finish the story he started and to set
the record straight about the McCreedys.

664
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:59,498
He was my best friend.

665
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:03,273
Now he's deceased.

666
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,283
I tracked down Mary McCreedy in 1986.

667
01:01:08,383 --> 01:01:11,552
I found that scary old bitch
on her deathbed,

668
01:01:11,652 --> 01:01:13,474
and she warned me.

669
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:19,452
She said that her grandson would do
what her son didn't have the balls to do.

670
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:23,713
Make Texarkana pay for its sins.

671
01:01:25,864 --> 01:01:28,269
Yeah. And no one else
has thought of this?

672
01:01:28,369 --> 01:01:33,107
Not like the police, or the FBI,
or the goddamn fucking Texas Rangers?

673
01:01:33,207 --> 01:01:35,478
Do you believe his story?

674
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:39,410
Are you kidding me?
The man lives on a boat.

675
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,944
Wait, do you believe him?

676
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:45,030
I don't know.

677
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:48,923
Hey, I'm just saying,

678
01:01:49,023 --> 01:01:50,925
if McCreedy did have a grandson,

679
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:54,595
he'd probably be in his 20s
or his 30s, at least. Nick.

680
01:01:54,695 --> 01:01:56,119
Come on.

681
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:15,083
As far as we know, fucking Charles
B. Pierce, Jr. could be the killer.

682
01:02:15,183 --> 01:02:16,784
He doesn't have a reason to be.

683
01:02:16,884 --> 01:02:19,954
His story was told,
his father's story was told.

684
01:02:20,054 --> 01:02:23,157
- Yeah, up until the sequel.
- But they're a part of the legend.

685
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:24,792
They're in the movie.
They're there somewhere.

686
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:26,567
- All of them except for...
- McCreedy.

687
01:02:27,795 --> 01:02:30,698
Now, his name wasn't even
mentioned in the papers.

688
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:32,467
He doesn't have a plaque anywhere.

689
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:36,118
He's not even in the movie that
they show every damn year. It's...

690
01:02:36,218 --> 01:02:39,423
- It'd be upsetting.
- It's an injustice, Nick.

691
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:43,046
Hank McCreedy's grandson
would see it as an injustice.

692
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:52,154
<i>Now, this is a very sad day</i>

693
01:02:52,254 --> 01:02:53,454
<i>for us all.</i>

694
01:02:53,554 --> 01:02:59,060
<i>It always is when you lose an officer
of the law in the line of duty.</i>

695
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,663
<i>Now, I did not work
with Deputy Tillman long,</i>

696
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:05,266
<i>but you all know him
a lot better than...</i>

697
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:10,638
How many of these have you gotten?
This is the second notice of acceptance.

698
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:12,256
Grandma, I just met somebody
and I think...

699
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:16,849
I am not gonna let this mess
be the most important thing in your life.

700
01:03:17,649 --> 01:03:19,280
Grandma, it already is.

701
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,782
I have talked to your uncle
in California

702
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,672
and he said that we can stay
with him as long as need be.

703
01:03:25,485 --> 01:03:27,620
Pack up.

704
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,942
We'll leave before daybreak.

705
01:04:08,529 --> 01:04:09,776
Tomorrow for sure?

706
01:04:11,997 --> 01:04:13,922
I'm already packed.

707
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,409
You couldn't wait a day?

708
01:04:32,086 --> 01:04:35,764
- I'm not gonna see you.
- I hate that.

709
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:40,137
I could come visit, though.

710
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:43,838
Yeah, of course.

711
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:47,383
Are you okay?

712
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,502
Yeah.

713
01:08:14,909 --> 01:08:17,633
- Grandma. I'll just be a second.
- Okay.

714
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:23,094
So, I'm not sure if anyone told you,

715
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:25,286
but my grandma and I are gonna
take off for a little while.

716
01:08:26,127 --> 01:08:28,521
Yeah, she mentioned that.

717
01:08:28,621 --> 01:08:29,960
Can I show you something?

718
01:08:30,324 --> 01:08:34,497
It could be nothing, but I just think
it should be investigated by someone.

719
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:41,135
- Who's he?
- His name's Hank McCreedy.

720
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:45,389
He was the original Phantom's last victim
but he's sort of forgotten about.

721
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:47,042
I heard a story about him,
so I did some research,

722
01:08:47,142 --> 01:08:48,976
and he's got a grandson somewhere.

723
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:51,061
I've been writing an article.

724
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:53,881
I'm gonna try and finish it
when I get to California.

725
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:56,183
I'll look into it for you, I promise.

726
01:08:56,283 --> 01:08:58,572
Jami. Come on, hon.

727
01:09:01,855 --> 01:09:04,046
Drive safe.

728
01:09:27,648 --> 01:09:30,730
Never left Texas my whole life.

729
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,735
Isn't that somethin'?

730
01:09:54,802 --> 01:09:57,770
Do you want anything else?
Just a coffee?

731
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:02,050
A Danish. And... get some water.

732
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:14,128
<i>Good morning.
It's New Year's Day here at KYGL,</i>

733
01:10:14,228 --> 01:10:17,756
<i>and for you early birds,
here's a classic.</i>

734
01:11:18,523 --> 01:11:20,533
Grandma?

735
01:11:22,227 --> 01:11:24,261
Grandma.

736
01:11:33,672 --> 01:11:35,543
Grandma, no! No!

737
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:40,387
No! No! Don't...

738
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:43,285
Help me, please, somebody!

739
01:14:00,787 --> 01:14:02,956
The Phantom, he's...

740
01:14:03,056 --> 01:14:05,994
Like a dog with a bone, ain't ya?

741
01:14:56,209 --> 01:14:57,176
What?

742
01:15:12,893 --> 01:15:18,956
Oh, my God. Oh, God,
oh, God. Oh, no, no. No.

743
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:25,587
The fuck...

744
01:15:40,754 --> 01:15:42,304
Foster.

745
01:15:48,996 --> 01:15:51,033
Go on, show her, boy.

746
01:15:56,169 --> 01:15:58,203
- No!
- Hey, Jami.

747
01:15:58,603 --> 01:16:00,173
No!

748
01:16:00,673 --> 01:16:02,693
No!

749
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:06,350
No! I saw him die!

750
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:09,367
- I watched you die! I know...
- If you remember,

751
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:11,217
you actually missed most of it.

752
01:16:11,752 --> 01:16:13,921
They found his body.
They found his body.

753
01:16:14,021 --> 01:16:16,540
No, I found his body.

754
01:16:17,783 --> 01:16:19,356
The poor runaway kid.

755
01:16:19,793 --> 01:16:23,366
Cut up his face, knocked out
his teeth, left two of mine.

756
01:16:25,032 --> 01:16:28,769
Are you Hank McCreedy's grandson?
One of you is Hank McCreedy's grandson.

757
01:16:28,869 --> 01:16:30,932
I am.

758
01:16:31,799 --> 01:16:33,769
And now,

759
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:36,494
thanks to you,

760
01:16:36,594 --> 01:16:39,431
they're gonna remember my granddaddy.

761
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:41,251
Corey.

762
01:16:41,748 --> 01:16:46,671
All those people died. My grandma.
Why did you do it?

763
01:16:48,553 --> 01:16:51,150
Born in Texarkana,

764
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,811
buried in Texarkana.

765
01:16:56,296 --> 01:16:58,500
Well, not me, God damn it.

766
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:03,388
But I knew we were the same, you and me.
Both of us trapped.

767
01:17:03,488 --> 01:17:05,973
No. We are not the same.

768
01:17:06,073 --> 01:17:08,575
Didn't this town decide who you were?

769
01:17:08,675 --> 01:17:11,979
The crazy girl, with the...
the dead parents?

770
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:14,785
Oh, it was the same with me.

771
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:17,903
I was the golden boy. A football star.

772
01:17:18,103 --> 01:17:22,987
I'd go to college like my dad
and I'd come back like my dad.

773
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:24,180
Well, fuck that!

774
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,227
I wanted to be a part
of something special.

775
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:30,330
I wanted to be remembered!
Like the Phantom.

776
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:33,333
When people talk about
what happened in Texarkana,

777
01:17:33,433 --> 01:17:37,487
about how the Phantom
came back, oh, I'll know!

778
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:41,043
I'll know that I, I made that...

779
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:45,946
They're gonna keep looking for you.

780
01:17:46,046 --> 01:17:49,192
- They're gonna keep looking for the...
- Jami!

781
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:58,579
Why would they?

782
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,928
- No!
- When I tell 'em...

783
01:18:01,028 --> 01:18:04,063
that I caught the two kids who did it.

784
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:09,164
Who were so obsessed with the Phantom,
that one faked his own death.

785
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:10,637
She killed her own grandma.

786
01:18:10,737 --> 01:18:13,518
- No! No, fuck you!
- And you know what?

787
01:18:13,618 --> 01:18:17,038
They'll believe me. Only because...

788
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:24,050
everybody in this town just wants
to believe this whole thing is over.

789
01:18:42,368 --> 01:18:43,861
It is over.

790
01:19:11,098 --> 01:19:15,802
<i>This story is about Texarkana.
A town that is really two towns.</i>

791
01:19:15,902 --> 01:19:20,673
<i>Two sheriffs. Two mayors.
And in the end, two Phantoms.</i>

792
01:19:21,473 --> 01:19:23,877
<i>After I came out
of the Redwater Bayous that night,</i>

793
01:19:23,977 --> 01:19:26,546
<i>Ranger Morales and his men went back in.</i>

794
01:19:26,646 --> 01:19:30,884
<i>They wanted to close the most
terrible chapter in our town's history.</i>

795
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:35,138
<i>Some people say
the swamp took Deputy Foster,</i>

796
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:38,308
<i>that the swamp gave him
the only burial he deserved.</i>

797
01:19:38,408 --> 01:19:40,755
<i>Others believed I hadn't killed
the Phantom 'cause he was something</i>

798
01:19:40,855 --> 01:19:44,538
<i>that couldn't be killed...
a demon or a spirit.</i>

799
01:19:44,638 --> 01:19:46,633
<i>People believe
what they need to believe.</i>

800
01:19:46,733 --> 01:19:49,369
<i>They make up whatever story
they need to keep living sanely.</i>

801
01:19:49,469 --> 01:19:51,052
<i>...I did the Bootleggers,</i>

802
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:54,207
<i>and The Legend of Boggy Creek
and this is my third one, Winterhawk.</i>

803
01:19:54,307 --> 01:19:56,910
<i>The hardest thing for my town
has been the wrestling to understand</i>

804
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,396
<i>how Clayborn Foster
and Corey found each other</i>

805
01:19:59,496 --> 01:20:01,841
<i>and put on those masks</i>

806
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:04,584
<i>and did those inhuman things.</i>

807
01:20:04,684 --> 01:20:07,854
<i>Their lives were investigated
and there was nothing linking them.</i>

808
01:20:07,954 --> 01:20:11,691
<i>They had nothing in common
except the darkness in their souls.</i>

809
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:16,195
<i>And I swear, that will keep the Phantom
alive as much as anything else.</i>

810
01:20:16,295 --> 01:20:17,931
<i>As for me,</i>

811
01:20:18,031 --> 01:20:21,066
<i>I did what my grandma always wanted.</i>

812
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:23,455
<i>I left Texas.</i>

813
01:20:23,555 --> 01:20:25,660
<i>I moved away.</i>

814
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,774
<i>To a new life,</i>

815
01:20:27,874 --> 01:20:32,093
<i>to a place where no one knows
who I am, or what I survived.</i>

816
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:35,282
<i>Where I'm the only person that knows
that as quickly and as senselessly</i>

817
01:20:35,382 --> 01:20:38,585
<i>as death came to Texarkana in 1946,</i>

818
01:20:38,685 --> 01:20:41,629
<i>and then again late last year,</i>

819
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:43,622
<i>it could come back</i>

820
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:46,347
<i>the next time the sun goes down.</i>
