burns them out in the field.

in her head that she ate something,

Is that a deal?

00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,673
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

502
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,201
I'm sorry about this.

503
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,261
You must not be happy now.

It's okay, Pop Pop. I'm okay.
We're just here till Saturday.

00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,957
He was a great director.

520
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,268
I made you cheddar biscuits, dear.

521
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,257
Was the old coot getting ready
for the costume party again?

522
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,384
BECCA: Yeah, he was.

523
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,720
He's crazy.

524
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,448
I'm just doing some chores in the barn.
I'll be in in a minute.

525
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,328
Something happened to your computer.

526
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,274
I spilled some biscuit batter on it.

527
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,751
I tried to clean it with cleaner.

528
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,587
I'm sorry.

529
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,743
TYLER: <i>She's weird during the day,</i>
and then gets even weirder at night?

530
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,703
I'm telling you it's okay.

531
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,888
I downloaded the definition
of "Sundowning."

532
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,250
You wouldn't understand half the words
I'm reading. The word "YOLO" isn't in it.

533
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,921
It's got to do with neurological
reactions to sunshine and moonlight.

534
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,523
It's literally a chemical reaction.

535
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,052
"Sundown Syndrome: a term
for disorientation, agitation,

536
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,845
"a general worsening of mental symptoms,

537
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,932
"classically described in the elderly
at dusk or nightfall."

538
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,101
It's normal old-age problems.

539
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,078
People are scared
of old people for no reason.

540
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,605
What about the computer?

541
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,690
The only thing messed up
is the computer camera.

542
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,275
There's something else going on.

543
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,110
She used oven cleaner,

544
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,672
and now the tiny camera
on the screen doesn't see anything.

545
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,783
You don't find that odd at all?

546
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,201
She made a mistake.

547
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,721
Just come to accept they're old people
and things won't be as weird.

548
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,415
MOM: <i>We're on the upper deck.</i>

549
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,126
<i>Miguel has entered
a hairy chest competition.</i>

550
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,895
<i>He's getting oiled.</i>

551
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,480
(CHUCKLES)

552
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,608
<i>It's so weird I can't see you.</i>

553
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,135
(SIGHS) I think I can clean it off.

554
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,071
<i>Tyler, why are you quiet?</i>

555
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,701
Nana and Pop Pop are acting strange. Ow!

556
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,455
<i>What kind of strange?
Becca, did you hit Tyler?</i>

557
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,915
No.

558
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,334
<i>Kids?</i>

559
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,239
Pop Pop wears diapers
and he keeps them in an outhouse,

560
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,824
and Nana walks around
at night without her clothes,

561
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,927
and Pop Pop thinks
strangers are following him.

562
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,331
(EXHALES) <i>I knew we were gonna have
this call. They're old, Tyler.</i>

563
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,958
I've discussed this with him.

564
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,294
<i>Old people have trouble
with their bodies sometimes.</i>

565
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,839
<i>They also aren't very self-aware.
They can get paranoid, too.</i>

566
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,340
<i>Becca, how strange are they acting?</i>

567
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,509
They haven't been mean one second.

568
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,178
- Nana crawled after us under the house.
- Playing hide-and-seek.

569
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,389
<i>You guys played hide-and-seek
under the house? I used to love that!</i>

570
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,515
Carrie Underwood.

571
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,309
<i>T, just bear with it
for a couple of days.</i>

572
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,061
<i>My parents were strange back then.
Mom was a hippie.</i>

573
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,272
<i>She used to sunbathe in the back yard
without warning back then.</i>

574
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,857
I'm already partially blind.

575
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,527
<i>I used to get so embarrassed.
They're just weird people, honey.</i>

576
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,713
<i>What level of problem is this?</i>

577
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,965
One.

578
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,326
One.

579
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,410
See?

580
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,345

00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,814
<i>I got to go. I wish I could
see your faces clearer.</i>

585
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,178
Hi, honey.

(WATER RUNNING)

587
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,936
Nana, could I ask you about Mom?

588
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:16,765
Maybe you'd be okay to talk
for a minute in an interview?

(FAUCET CLOSED)

590
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:37,135
Would you mind getting
inside the oven to clean it?

591
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm sorry? (SIGHS)

592
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,100
I'm too big. I can't reach back there.

593
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,562
The kitchen's got to be clean.

594
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,566
The oven's off.

595
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,904
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure.

596
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,542
Get farther in there.

597
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,843
All the way in.

598
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:35,694
Okay, I'll star in your movie.

599
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,950
BECCA: If you could be any animal,
what would you be?

600
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,561
Is there a right answer?

601
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:48,123
No, these questions are intended
to get you loosened up.

602
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,666
Oh.

603
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,170
- A grizzly bear.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

I think we're warm.

605
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:01,011
Mom told me that you and Pop Pop
were very much in love.

606
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,638
Where did you first meet Pop Pop?

607
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,792
In a garden.

608
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,919
And what did you think of him?

609
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,588
Oh, he was handsome.

610
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,592
He has a very strong personality.

611
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,719
This is great.

We'll come back to that.

Right now, I want to talk
about something else.

00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:27,579
I know it happened a long time ago,
but what happened on the day Mom left?

615
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,999
She won't tell me.

616
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,546
Did she do something?

I don't wanna star in your movie.

Okay. It's Wednesday night.
Three nights left.

what exactly is going on.

00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,360
I'm putting the camera
out tonight. Okay?

628
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,070
It's like we're living with a werewolf.

629
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,405
You can't record her.

630
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,573
Swerve.

631
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:22,492
I know you won't understand this because
your brain isn't fully developed yet,

632
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,202
but you can't do this.

633
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,720
Why?

634
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,498
It's exploitative.
I have cinematic standards.

00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,043
(LAUGHING) No. No one gives a crap
about cinematic standards, okay?

It's not the 1800s.

Have you seen reality TV?

in the event, we can't record it.

It's just what's ethical.

00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,808
No offense to Ryan Seacrest or whoever
came up with the <i>Housekeepers of Houston.</i>

You think you're so great, don't you?

talking in their sleep.

You used to talk in your sleep

No, but Dad is hilarious. Dad's funny.

Do you remember that?

What do you mean "stuff happens"?

678
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,183
People leave.

679
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,629
Because they find something
they like better.

Make me believe you.

00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:10,446
So, I'm on the Titans pee wee

It was at the end and we were leading.

00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,343
So if we stop them,
we probably win the game.

688
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,121
Give me context. How old are you?

00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,643
So, I'm free safety.

691
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,920
Which means that I'm supposed
to tackle the guy

692
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,274
if he makes it past
the people on the line.

693
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,925
- So, their running back punches the hole...
- Okay.

694
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,069
Am I supposed to be
following these terms?

695
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,405
Are these phrases supposed
to mean something to me?

696
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,948
Just listen.

697
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,869
So their running back, who's big,
makes it past the line,

698
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,606
and I'm the only one left to tackle him.

699
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:45,732
All I got to do is tackle him,

700
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,251
put my hands around him
and tackle him, but...

701
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,547
I just stand there.

702
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,285
They call it "freezing"
and I could hear everyone yelling.

703
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:01,347
Coach Daugherty, Dad.
All my teammates, and...

704
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,500
He gets the first down
and runs and runs,

705
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,563
and the other team is celebrating,
and I'm still standing there.

706

707
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:19,265
Then the assistant coach
came and got me,

708
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,476
and Dad patted me on the shoulder
and then went to the car,

709
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:25,246
and he never told me
he was angry or anything.

710
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,692
You think Dad didn't
say anything and left

711
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,587
because you didn't tackle
another eight-year-old in a game

712
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,380
five years ago?

713
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,763
