1
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,411
I told you to
keep an eye on her!

2
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:50,017
I was. It came on so suddenly.

3
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:00,099
Get some towels
and another pillow.

4
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,456
There may still be a chance.

5
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:18,027
Get her ready.

6
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:33,418
She's the last one.

7
00:01:57,187 --> 00:02:01,094
Where's my baby?

8
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,296
Where's my baby?

9
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,132
I'm sorry, Mrs. Slater.

10
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,507
No.

11
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,344
No!

12
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:18,687
No!

13
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:50,388
Does anybody have a hairbrush?
I can't find it anywhere!

14
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:53,661
I just hope there are enough
bags to carry all this.

15
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,432
Well, we moved it on
here in the same bags, Mom.

16
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,775
Does anyone ever
clean that pool?

17
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:05,311
Hardly.

18
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:08,450
Mrs. Slater says she's not paying
anyone to clean it if we never use it.

19
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,786
How are we supposed to use it
if it's always dirty?

20
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,558
Yeah. It sounds like
Mrs. Slater, all right.

21
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:15,227
Well, we've just had the
pool man over,

22
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,329
so you can swim all summer
while you're at home.

23
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:24,373
I'm not moving back home, Mom.

24
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:25,876
This has nothing
to do with you.

25
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:29,416
I just have a lot
to think about.

26
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,220
Like what I'm going to do
with the rest of my life.

27
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:35,911
Well, don't you think
after four years of college

28
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:38,763
you'd have a start
in those decisions?

29
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,765
Katie, stop packing!

30
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,271
Hi, Mrs. Rose,
how you doing?

31
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:47,943
Katie, come here a second.

32
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:51,250
I just want you to stay till
Friday to help set things up.

33
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,452
How about it?

34
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,927
By Friday, we're going to have
this place looking outrageous!

35
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,663
Come on, yes or no?

36
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:04,736
All six of us are staying.

37
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,838
Ok.

38
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,474
Great!

39
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:10,545
By the way, don't worry
about a date for Friday night.

40
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,416
-I went ahead and fixed you up!
-You what?

41
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,654
No need to
thank me! Ciao!

42
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:52,544
Yes?

43
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:59,922
Thank you. You can send
her right in.

44
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:01,726
They're just
asking for talks.

45
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:02,992
You've got to reconsider.

46
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:04,663
My mind
is made up.

47
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,368
I intend to spend this summer as
I've spent all the rest.

48
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,636
But the environment
here is so much more helpful.

49
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,074
I told you,
there'll be no one at the house.

50
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:14,411
It was closed for
three months today.

51
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,515
I understand, but
anything might happen.

52
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:23,625
At least here, we're
prepared to handle it.

53
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,031
His condition is getting worse.
You know it as well as I do.

54
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,900
We both knew the risks.

55
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:33,541
For 20 years, you've been
blaming me for what happened.

56
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:34,842
Don't you see?

57
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,780
You're living in
a fantasy world.

58
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,648
You've got to
forget the past.

59
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,952
Live with what
you have today.

60
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:43,490
You have done a good
job of forgetting.

61
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:45,394
Well, I never will.

62
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:49,065
If you try to stop me from
living as I please,

63
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,635
I'll see that what you
did is remembered.

64
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,548
I've had a
new tag made.

65
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,151
This must be worn
at all times,

66
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:05,022
just in case there
are any problems.

67
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,693
There'll be no problems.

68
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:08,995
Good day.

69
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,056
Vicki, where
you taking me?

70
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:35,837
Just wait.

71
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,074
Holy shit, look
at this place.

72
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,612
Is it deserted
enough for ya?

73
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:41,812
Come on, let me try it.

74
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,853
Do like I told you,
though, all right?

75
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,990
Yeah, yeah,
I will, I will.

76
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,060
Aim it at that
sack over there.

77
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:54,165
Ok.

78
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,008
Will you get off me?

79
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:05,116
Go on, pull the trigger. Just...

80
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,042
All right, all right.

81
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,581
Come on, come on up front,
I'll start this time.

82
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:29,086
-Ok.
-A toast to law school.

83
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:33,693
May it be the three shortest
years of my life.

84
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,630
I hope so!

85
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:36,832
Ok, ok.

86
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,370
Here is to reaching
my fullest capacity.

87
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,206
Bout a quart and a half!

88
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:48,315
Here's to Pan Am,
my new employer.

89
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:51,654
May they never find out
I'm scared of flying!

90
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,918
To my mother,

91
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,800
who never let me forget I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

92
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:04,273
Mama, you were wrong...
It's up my nose!

93
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,873
Come on, Katie.

94
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:27,143
Ok.

95
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,446
I wanna thank you all.

96
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:30,981
Noo, no

97
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,483
No, I'm serious.

98
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:38,460
I wanna thank you all for
helping me become what I am today.

99
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:40,228
Wasted!

100
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,246
Morgan, it's your turn.

101
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,220
We realize this takes a
lot of thinking, Morgan.

102
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,990
Ok.

103
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:02,429
A toast to... to...

104
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:09,006
God, I'm... excuse me!

105
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:12,880
God!

106
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,117
What are you girls doing here?

107
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:17,387
Who, us?

108
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,257
The house is closed.

109
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:21,326
What are you girls doing here?

110
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,497
Well...

111
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,031
You tell her, Diane.

112
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,302
It's all very
simple, Mrs. Slater.

113
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:30,875
We had to move the graduation
party from the Silver Bear.

114
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:32,244
Move it?

115
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,281
Insufficient funds.

116
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:36,917
So, we...

117
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,955
We're having the party here.

118
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:40,588
Really?

119
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:42,391
We're only staying a
couple of extra days

120
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:43,828
to set it up.

121
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,999
And whose idea was all this?

122
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:51,439
Well, Vicki thought the house would be
the perfect place, and we all agreed.

123
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,209
Vicki.

124
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:54,979
Where is she?

125
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:58,049
We haven't seen her.

126
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,888
I'll speak to her later.

127
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,392
As for you girls,

128
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:08,365
how could you even think of
having a drunken spree in my house?

129
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:12,104
There'll be no party here.

130
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:13,473
The house is closed.

131
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:16,612
I want you all out by tomorrow.

132
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:20,318
Good night.

133
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,861
Sheesh.

134
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,331
The wicked witch of the
west strikes again.

135
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,067
She can't kick us out, can she?

136
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:34,138
No way. The bylaws
say we can stay.

137
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,876
Like always, she's just
flapping her wings.

138
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,915
Why does she always close
the house on June 19th?

139
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,984
Every other house stays
open through the weekend.

140
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,387
Who knows?

141
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,023
-She's retiring, anyways.
-Nuh-who said?

142
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,594
-I heard talk about it.
-I can't believe it!

143
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:52,033
-She's an institution around here.
-She's the sorority mascot.

144
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:55,571
Yeah, the house jackass.

145
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:58,376
Well, maybe this place'll
finally get a normal house mother.

146
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:01,825
The kind who sits in her
room and drinks tea.

147
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,763
She is different.

148
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:06,802
Just a shame she's
gotten so weird.

149
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,338
She used to lend a little tradition
to the house, you know?

150
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,311
Slater is the last
of her breed.

151
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:16,117
When she goes, the
species'll be extinct.

152
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,353
Let's propose a toast.

153
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:20,923
To Mrs. Slater.

154
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:24,462
The house mother to end
all house mothers.

155
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:30,072
Yeah, that's for sure.

156
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,976
Wait a
minute. Not here.

157
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,145
Why not?
We always do it here.

158
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:20,916
Not tonight.

159
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,555
Count to 20, I'll
meet you upstairs.

160
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:30,164
-What?
-Count to 20, Rick.

161
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,449
Vicki?

162
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:46,625
Vicki?

163
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:51,465
Vicki?

164
00:15:55,037 --> 00:16:00,046
Look what daddy bought
his little girl.

165
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:52,554
You filth!

166
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:57,562
Trash like you doesn't
belong in my house.

167
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:04,406
Slater, I'm
going to kill you!

168
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,809
You bitch!

169
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,418
I'll get back at you if
it's the last thing I do!

170
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,793
You hear me, goddamn it!

171
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:23,839
-Vicki, what are you doing?
-Bitch!

172
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,712
Vicki, what
are you doing?

173
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,415
We can't swim
the damn thing, anyway,

174
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,816
what's the difference?

175
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,292
Jesus.

176
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,630
How was that romantic
little skinny-dip last night?

177
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,099
You shut up.

178
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:43,335
-Chill out.
-My water bed got slashed to pieces,

179
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,506
and all I should
is joke about it?

180
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,542
I'm telling you guys,
she tried to kill me!

181
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:49,479
Come on, Vicki,
you deserved it.

182
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,817
Can't you fuck anywhere else?

183
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,585
Mrs. Slater really flipped.

184
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:55,723
She's never gone
that crazy before.

185
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:56,792
Wait till the party.

186
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,927
God, when she sees the liquor,
she'll have a stroke.

187
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,064
To hell with her.

188
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:04,904
Sick of worrying about
what Slater thinks.

189
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,773
We run this house!

190
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,745
For four years, we've had to
put up with her and her shit!

191
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,884
She's right, that lady's
been a royal pain in the ass.

192
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,519
Yeah, well there's
been a million times

193
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,790
that bitch has
screwed us all over.

194
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:20,696
We can't let her get away
with this time, right?

195
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:24,434
Do you have something in mind, or are
you just exercising your mouth again?

196
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:25,972
Yeah, I do have
something in mind.

197
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:29,711
Slater wants things to be
as they used to be, right?

198
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,246
Ok.

199
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,487
Well, how about if we give her a
good old-fashioned sorority prank?

200
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,956
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

201
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,692
What, are you kidding?

202
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:44,769
-Like what?
-Wait a minute. Let me think.

203
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:46,237
How about we
T.P. her room?

204
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:47,072
No, no, no.

205
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:49,476
How about the old dog shit
in a paper bag routine?

206
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:51,445
No, we did that
freshman year, no.

207
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,947
How about a bucket
of water over her door?

208
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,115
So when she comes
in, she gets it?

209
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:56,553
Tomorrow morning, we
could short-sheet her bed?

210
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:58,021
No, no, no, no.
I got a great one.

211
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:00,594
Let's spread glue on
her toilet seat!

212
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,595
I got it!

213
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,532
It's perfect!

214
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,802
Well, are you interested or not?

215
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:08,006
This is silly.

216
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,577
I mean, we're supposed to be
mature adults by now, right?

217
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,983
One more fling won't
set us back any.

218
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:18,121
Ok.

219
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:21,203
We'll do it on Friday, right
before our party starts?

220
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,728
Ok, sounds great.

221
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,863
Evaluation as follows,

222
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:45,898
Condition clearly stems
from Mrs. Slater's

223
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:48,503
extremely difficult and
traumatic delivery.

224
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:52,043
Since that point, the
slow progression towards

225
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:54,213
a psychotic break
has been evident.

226
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,718
X-rays taken after
an errant cephalogram

227
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:01,223
reveal the cortex undergoing
a process of decay.

228
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:07,767
Patient's advanced age is
aggravating the condition.

229
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,743
My recommendation is for
immediate advanced treatment.

230
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:17,183
The next three months must be spent
under complete clinical supervision.

231
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:20,185
Allowed to live in an
uncontrolled environment,

232
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,794
there's a good chance that any traumatic
episode could act as a stimulus

233
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:28,134
for the patient's
latent violence.

234
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:45,862
Vicki, where'd you
get this thing?

235
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:49,667
I have my sources.

236
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,771
-Is it loaded?
-Of course not.

237
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:05,160
Go ahead, it's not
going to bite you.

238
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:06,930
Bam!

239
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:09,934
That's not funny.

240
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:11,402
Vicki, this is crazy.

241
00:23:11,436 --> 00:23:14,775
I mean, a joke is one
thing, but a gun?

242
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:20,050
Trust me, Katie, have
I ever been wrong?

243
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:23,056
Right before
the party starts,

244
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:26,895
Slater's going to be in for
one very big surprise.

245
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:45,458
Hold it,
hold it up here.

246
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,429
Well, it's heavy.

247
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,231
Ok.

248
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,900
I think we're going
to have to go up.

249
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:54,205
Ready?

250
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,115
-You got it?
-Ok, don't drop it on me.

251
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,897
Take all that junk down!

252
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:11,999
It's a disgrace!

253
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,304
I want all of you to
pack your belongings

254
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:15,974
and leave this
house at once.

255
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,877
Do you hear?

256
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:21,047
What if we don't?

257
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,254
You have a lot to learn
about this world, young lady.

258
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:28,327
Mrs. Slater, you seem to
be missing something.

259
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,130
Where is it?

260
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:36,172
Go check out by the pool.

261
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:02,982
Go ahead, take a swim.

262
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:05,320
You like getting
people wet, right?

263
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:07,088
I should teach you
a lesson or two.

264
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:10,260
Are you threatening me?

265
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:15,234
If that gun is real,
you are all in serious trouble.

266
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:17,906
We thought you might need
a little persuading.

267
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,441
What's wrong with a swim?

268
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:24,417
Come on, it's not much to ask for four
years of putting up with your shit.

269
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,155
Now, go on.

270
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:30,158
-Get out of my way.
-Go on!

271
00:25:30,192 --> 00:25:33,197
Vicki...

272
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,204
What the hell
are you doing?

273
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:38,606
I know exactly
what I'm doing!

274
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,042
Vicki, it's not
funny any more!

275
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:41,077
Shut up, Liz!

276
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,912
You all want this
as much as me.

277
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:44,482
Someone's gonna hurt.
Give me that gun!

278
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:50,591
She's all right.

279
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:53,128
Ok, Slater.

280
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,365
Move it!

281
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:59,272
-Vicki, you don't want to do this!
-Come on!

282
00:25:59,306 --> 00:26:01,676
Shut up! Go on!

283
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:04,413
-Vicki, Vicki, give me the gun.
-All the way in.

284
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:07,385
Vicki, I don't
think you wanna do this.

285
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:08,954
Vicki, what
are you doing?

286
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:11,058
No! Stop!

287
00:26:11,092 --> 00:26:12,560
Vicki, don't!

288
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:13,562
Vicki, no!

289
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:24,712
You
didn't really think...

290
00:26:24,746 --> 00:26:27,617
-You're wonderful!
-You don't believe us?

291
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:42,541
My God.

292
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:44,144
Get a blanket, somebody!

293
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:46,181
Quick, quick!
Get her out!

294
00:26:46,214 --> 00:26:49,085
All right, all right, easy, easy.
Watch her head, watch her head.

295
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:53,025
God, come on.

296
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,196
Where is the blanket? Come on!

297
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:57,031
Put her on a blanket!

298
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,232
Ok, ok, who knows
what to do?

299
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,038
Stevie, know what to do?

300
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,239
Roll her over!
Roll her over!

301
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,474
-This is impossible!
-Watch her head!

302
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:08,216
-Shut up, Vicki!
-I don't think she's breathing, Stevie!

303
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:09,618
She's not breathing!

304
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:11,122
Try and get an
ambulance, move it!

305
00:27:11,154 --> 00:27:11,988
Wait a minute.

306
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:13,025
What good's an
ambulance gonna do now?

307
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,625
There might still
be a chance, hurry!

308
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:15,827
Don't you realize
what we've done?

309
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:20,302
-It was an accident!
-That doesn't matter!

310
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:25,411
We killed her.

311
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,117
My God,
the band's here.

312
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:32,688
Vicki?

313
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:34,424
Morgan, run to the
door and stall the band!

314
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:38,365
-Hurry!
-Ok.

315
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:44,275
Ok, shit.
She doesn't have any relatives.

316
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,811
We either hide the body,
or face the police.

317
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:50,783
I am calling an ambulance.

318
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:54,657
Katie! Katie!

319
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:58,362
If you call now,
it's over for all of us!

320
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,401
Please, Katie,
please do what she says.

321
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,036
I don't wanna get in trouble.

322
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:10,648
Katherine, listen to Vicki.
You've got to!

323
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:11,818
Come on, Vicki!

324
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,322
What are we gonna do with her?

325
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:14,856
Come on, let's hurry!

326
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,125
Let's hide
her in the house.

327
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,164
No, no,
someone'll find her.

328
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,767
The pool.

329
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,138
It's perfect for now. We can
get her out tomorrow morning.

330
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:25,573
She's gonna float!
Won't she float?

331
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:28,411
-Stevie, won't she float?
-How the hell should I know?

332
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:30,575
I have an idea. Diane, run
to the porch and get as many

333
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,552
towels as you can find,
something to sink her with.

334
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,257
Stevie, go to the pool house, get a
rope, and something to cut it with.

335
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,590
Hurry up!

336
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,227
-Help me!
-Ok!

337
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,296
Got it.

338
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:44,571
Katie, you, too, come on!

339
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:46,173
Jesus.

340
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:54,985
Put it underneath her!

341
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,220
I can't reach over...

342
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:58,022
-Lift her head.
-I can't!

343
00:28:58,056 --> 00:28:59,991
-Just move her!
-Yes, you can. Lift it up a bit.

344
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:01,460
Goddamn it, give it to me.

345
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,695
-What about that down there?
-Put it through here.

346
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:05,097
Tie this all through.

347
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,333
-Make sure she's not gonna get out.
-It's ok.

348
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:14,174
God!

349
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:27,555
Get out of here.

350
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:34,761
Zeta, Eta, Theta,
lota Lambda, Moo, Nu...

351
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:38,667
-You forgot Kappa.
-Zeta...

352
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:40,736
Yeah,
I heard Finzer failed.

353
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:41,804
What?

354
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:44,373
What do you care?
I thought you hated him.

355
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:46,774
I do, but I copied
all his answers.

356
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:48,143
Are you in a frat?

357
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:49,511
Yeah, I'm a Beta.

358
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:52,114
Really? You don't look
like a Greek.

359
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:57,319
-Kata, Omicron, Pi.
-Hey, look at him.

360
00:30:57,353 --> 00:31:01,524
Yeah.
He is cute.

361
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,190
Bobby?

362
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,560
It's over this way.

363
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,694
It's over here.

364
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,165
My favorite tree in
the whole world.

365
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:43,736
You gotta watch out for squirrels here,
cause they can jump real high.

366
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:50,278
Here, you can use this one.

367
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:52,179
Bobby?

368
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:26,885
Vicki, where's Katherine?

369
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:32,924
Peter... Katie's upstairs.

370
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,385
Hi.

371
00:32:58,417 --> 00:32:59,521
You must be Katherine.

372
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:03,425
I'm Peter, hi.

373
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:07,461
-Hello.
-Vicki told me... are you ok?

374
00:33:07,494 --> 00:33:13,936
Yeah. I'm ok.

375
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:15,471
Would you like to
be left alone?

376
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:21,745
No, it's just... its nothing.

377
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:24,415
Damn it.

378
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:27,585
Look, blind dates
are silly, anyway.

379
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:32,957
Why don't I just go?

380
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:36,627
Wait...

381
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,597
I'm all right, really.

382
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,967
Are you sure?

383
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:45,603
You
wanna go downstairs?

384
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:46,771
Great, great.

385
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:51,543
I bought this for you.

386
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:52,813
It was very sweet.

387
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:55,849
Thank you.

388
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:13,467
Do you wanna dance?

389
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,004
Not now.

390
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:17,673
How about a drink?

391
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:19,009
Maybe later.

392
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:21,978
I could use one.

393
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:23,413
I'll be right back, ok?

394
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:15,737
Get the... help me!

395
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:19,807
One... two...

396
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,143
-There's a wet t-shirt contest!
-Really?

397
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:24,880
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:26,982
Nice try!

399
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:29,751
That one was good.

400
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,756
-Are you ok?
-Get her out of there. My God.

401
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:36,793
Diane, here give me...

402
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:37,927
Careful.

403
00:35:40,695 --> 00:35:42,665
Shit, the pool lights.

404
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:44,434
What is somebody
turns them on?

405
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:24,644
No, no, please.

406
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,912
No, please, no!

407
00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:39,125
Thank you very much.

408
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:41,027
Thank you.

409
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,796
We've come to a special part
of the evening tonight,

410
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,865
I think one you've all
been waiting for.

411
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:47,000
Will you, just clear the
dance floor here please?

412
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:50,070
Get everybody to back
off a little bit.

413
00:38:50,104 --> 00:38:51,073
That's good.

414
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:54,108
Let's get our graduating
ladies out front here.

415
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:57,312
Give em a big hand!

416
00:38:57,345 --> 00:39:05,954
Let's get em all
out front here.

417
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:08,757
Ok, quiet down, quiet down
out there, quiet down.

418
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,626
Where's Stevie?

419
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,229
She's upstairs polishing
her tennis shoes.

420
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:22,072
Ok, we're gonna the snowball off
with these six ladies up here.

421
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,708
You all can join
in after while.

422
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:28,746
Vicki?

423
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:38,089
Where's my gun?

424
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:42,161
Upstairs.

425
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:44,296
Hey, how'd your
little prank go?

426
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,335
Just fine.

427
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:10,292
This is really gross.

428
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,261
When's the last time
they cleaned this pool?

429
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:14,429
Looks ok to me.

430
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,743
Where is Stevie?

431
00:40:26,776 --> 00:40:28,845
I can't believe a
house mother like

432
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:30,948
Mrs. Slater would let
all this happen.

433
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:33,850
Just the way
I like it.

434
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:35,953
Well, go ahead,
pig, jump in!

435
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:40,992
Wait a minute,
I gotta prepare.

436
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:56,374
You know, I'm really
glad this is working out.

437
00:40:56,408 --> 00:41:02,449
I'm really having a
nice time. Are you?

438
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:03,951
I'm a sea pig!

439
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,896
My God!

440
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,349
I'm a sea pig.

441
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:51,168
She's alive.

442
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:55,440
We put her back in the pool,
and she was still alive!

443
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,544
You and Stevie are the ones
to blame for that.

444
00:41:57,576 --> 00:41:59,411
You said she was dead, not me!

445
00:41:59,444 --> 00:42:00,711
Who's to blame for shooting her!

446
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,982
How was I supposed to know
there's another bullet in the gun!

447
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:08,020
It doesn't matter now.

448
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:09,689
Where is Stevie?

449
00:42:09,723 --> 00:42:11,591
I've looked all over for her.

450
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:15,329
She must have left before
she could turn off the...

451
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:17,130
It's a good thing she didn't.

452
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:20,267
We would have never known
Mrs. Slater is still alive.

453
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,403
How do we know she is alive?

454
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:24,038
What do you think she
floated out of that pool?

455
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:25,941
Or, maybe she got
sucked down the drain?

456
00:42:25,973 --> 00:42:27,107
Do you believe this?

457
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,410
Look what we're talking about!

458
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:31,011
Jeanie, stop.

459
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:32,547
Morgan may be right.

460
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:34,362
Mrs. Slater could have
collapsed somewhere

461
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:35,550
just after getting
out of the pool.

462
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:39,888
We have got to find her,
before somebody else does.

463
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:43,327
I cannot believe you, Vicki.

464
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:48,232
You'd sacrifice anything
to save yourself.

465
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:51,535
Even Mrs. Slater's life?

466
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:56,574
And what about
the rest of you?

467
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:04,615
I am calling the police,
I cannot live with this anymore.

468
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,452
Listen to me!

469
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:09,153
If she were alive, wouldn't
the police be here by now?

470
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,955
She's right, she would
have called hours ago.

471
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,091
What if she can't?

472
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:15,561
What if she's lying on the
ground bleeding to death?

473
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:20,132
If she were alive, she
would have reached a telephone.

474
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:22,301
Face it, Katie.

475
00:43:22,335 --> 00:43:30,178
Mrs. Slater is dead.

476
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,311
She won't call.

477
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,914
But what do we do?

478
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,316
Well, Mrs. Slater couldn't
have gotten far.

479
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:37,218
Let's check around the
outside of the house.

480
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:40,288
Morgan, go unpack Slater's clothes,
so it looks like she's left.

481
00:43:40,321 --> 00:43:46,227
We can find her, but we're
gonna have to hurry.

482
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:33,280
-Don't do that, Diane!
-I'm sorry.

483
00:44:33,313 --> 00:44:35,115
-Have you seen anything?
-No, have you?

484
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:40,155
No. Come on.

485
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:02,091
Water?

486
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,527
Give me something stronger.

487
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,167
She's all right.

488
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,504
How'd she ever get up
in the attic like that?

489
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:13,806
Why would she struggle all
that way, just to get up there?

490
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:14,943
God, who knows?

491
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:16,344
Where's her cane?

492
00:46:16,378 --> 00:46:18,980
I don't know! Must be in the
attic, I didn't see it in the pool.

493
00:46:19,014 --> 00:46:21,918
Don't have time to worry about
that now! We gotta get rid of her!

494
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,821
-Ok.
-What about the old cemetery?

495
00:46:23,853 --> 00:46:32,234
Nobody would ever
find her there.

496
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:33,668
Get
away from her!

497
00:46:36,204 --> 00:46:37,507
Morgan!

498
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:40,843
-God.
-Let her go!

499
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:43,882
We haven't got time to
waste pampering her!

500
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:44,950
She's a baby.

501
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:47,786
Her and Stevie, leaving
us to do this ourselves.

502
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,222
For Christ's sakes,
we're in this together.

503
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:56,266
After this is over...

504
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:02,541
Cowards.

505
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:04,909
You're all a bunch
of goddamn cowards.

506
00:48:48,716 --> 00:48:52,722
Morgan?

507
00:48:58,863 --> 00:49:04,071
Have you guys seen Morgan?

508
00:49:04,104 --> 00:49:08,109
Morgan?

509
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:32,108
Morgan, it's me.

510
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:33,978
Are you in there?

511
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:38,017
Morgan?

512
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,316
We're not carrying
her all the way, are we?

513
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:28,550
Nope.

514
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:29,819
Hey, hey, where did you get those?
Those are mine!

515
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:32,823
-We're using your car, Liz.
-No, wait! I just got it!

516
00:50:32,857 --> 00:50:34,892
Goddamn it, Liz, yours is the
only car that isn't blocked in.

517
00:50:34,926 --> 00:50:36,460
Forget it,
we're not using it!

518
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:38,833
Diane, you take them.

519
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:41,268
Wait, it's too crowded in
the front of the house.

520
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,504
We'll meet you at
the old garage.

521
00:50:42,537 --> 00:50:43,471
Hurry!

522
00:50:43,504 --> 00:50:46,041
God, we gotta find
something to put her in.

523
00:50:46,074 --> 00:50:47,076
What we are gonna use?

524
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:53,852
Vicki?

525
00:50:53,885 --> 00:51:00,528
That's perfect.

526
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:16,015
Watch the feet, Liz,
be... shit. Come on.

527
00:51:16,048 --> 00:51:18,451
Ouch.

528
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:31,102
Come on.

529
00:54:57,981 --> 00:54:59,350
God!

530
00:54:59,548 --> 00:55:00,752
What are you
doing up here?

531
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,888
I'm not really sure.

532
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:05,391
Well, I saw you
go up the steps,

533
00:55:05,424 --> 00:55:07,561
and I was just
wondering what you...

534
00:55:09,296 --> 00:55:11,900
Look at all this stuff.

535
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,872
This is a neat room.

536
00:55:15,905 --> 00:55:22,949
You know what?
Why don't you go downstairs?

537
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,358
This used to be
one of my favorite things.

538
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:38,502
Peter, why don't you go downstairs
and get yourself another drink?

539
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:45,612
-My God.
-What is it?

540
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,749
-Peter, go, go downstairs.
-But...

541
00:55:47,781 --> 00:55:51,788
Go on!

542
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:51,934
Is that you guys?

543
00:56:51,968 --> 00:56:57,543
Jeanie?

544
00:56:57,575 --> 00:57:00,079
Vicki?

545
00:57:02,682 --> 00:57:05,687
Liz?

546
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:54,719
We just have to get to the
garage, and we're home free.

547
00:57:54,752 --> 00:57:56,622
What is someone sees us?

548
00:57:56,655 --> 00:57:58,925
Stop
worrying, just push!

549
00:58:00,058 --> 00:58:01,628
Almost there.

550
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:07,771
You guys, my dress...

551
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:14,446
Hurry, get out of here.

552
00:58:27,563 --> 00:58:29,165
Come here.

553
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:36,641
Come here!

554
00:58:36,674 --> 00:58:37,944
657 to dispatch.

555
00:58:38,177 --> 00:58:39,613
657, go ahead.

556
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:41,482
Yeah, I got a
fender bender here.

557
00:58:41,515 --> 00:58:44,920
Send car 412 down here
on campus on my 1020.

558
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,055
Ten-four, acknowledged.

559
00:58:46,088 --> 00:58:47,157
Yeah, and
also be advised

560
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:50,027
I got two female suspects here.

561
00:58:50,061 --> 00:58:52,197
Ten-four.
Please keep us advised.

562
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:53,633
Ten-four.

563
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,572
Hell of a time to be
taking out the trash.

564
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:00,682
We always take the trash
out on Friday night.

565
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:01,542
Yeah.

566
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:03,979
At 1:43
in the morning?

567
00:59:04,981 --> 00:59:06,014
Sororities.

568
00:59:06,682 --> 00:59:07,717
What you got in there?

569
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:09,754
Nothing, officer.
We had a large party tonight,

570
00:59:09,787 --> 00:59:11,154
there's a lot of people
who had a lot of...

571
00:59:11,188 --> 00:59:13,091
We had an awful lot of
garbage to get rid of.

572
00:59:13,124 --> 00:59:14,495
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

573
00:59:14,928 --> 00:59:16,062
657, go ahead.

574
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,798
1019 to station.

575
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:20,600
I'll be right there.

576
00:59:20,633 --> 00:59:23,105
Look, turn this thing around
and get it back up to house.

577
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:26,644
And don't let me catch you around
here anymore, you understand?

578
00:59:26,676 --> 00:59:35,788
-We'll see, thank you, officer.
-Good night.

579
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:07,831
Jeanie!

580
01:00:07,864 --> 01:00:10,069
Jeanie, what happened?

581
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:12,706
Did somebody do this to you?

582
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,643
Who?

583
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:18,245
Where did it happen?

584
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:22,185
-Gate.
-Gate?

585
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:24,120
Jeanie, I'm gonna
have to get help.

586
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,756
I'm gonna get somebody,
we'll take you to the hospital.

587
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,727
Cane.

588
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,963
Cane.

589
01:00:31,564 --> 01:00:37,105
Ok, Jeanie, it's gonna be all right,
ok? I promise. I'll be right back, ok?

590
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:41,144
Come on.

591
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:52,759
Bye, meet me down
at the bar, ok?

592
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:30,504
Jeanie!?

593
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:35,312
Katherine, what are you, what is
wrong? Why won't you just tell me?

594
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:38,083
Something's happened to them.

595
01:03:38,117 --> 01:03:40,385
What are
you talking about?

596
01:03:40,419 --> 01:03:43,023
Three of my
friends are missing.

597
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:46,961
I'm calling the police.

598
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:51,267
Are you sure about this?

599
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,903
Couldn't they have
just left the party?

600
01:03:52,937 --> 01:03:54,812
Nobody saw them leave,
and Jeanie was in

601
01:03:54,813 --> 01:03:56,642
no condition to go
anyplace by herself.

602
01:03:56,675 --> 01:03:58,143
Should I get
your house mother?

603
01:03:58,175 --> 01:04:00,212
They're gonna wanna
speak to her.

604
01:04:00,245 --> 01:04:02,282
Sheriff's department.

605
01:04:02,315 --> 01:04:04,117
This is Sgt. Palmer.

606
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:06,253
Hello?

607
01:04:06,287 --> 01:04:07,456
Hello?

608
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:09,592
What are you doing?

609
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,095
Katherine?

610
01:04:12,128 --> 01:04:17,602
You're probably right, that they
just must have left the party.

611
01:04:17,635 --> 01:04:19,404
It's late, I think you
better be leaving.

612
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:24,579
I'm sorry, Peter.

613
01:04:37,428 --> 01:04:38,698
She isn't here!

614
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:42,102
What?

615
01:04:42,135 --> 01:04:43,670
Diane?

616
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:46,342
Diane?

617
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:50,647
Diane? The keys are
here. Where is she?

618
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,649
This is
really unbelievable.

619
01:04:52,683 --> 01:04:55,320
Why am I always
saving everyone's ass?

620
01:04:55,353 --> 01:05:01,362
Forget it, let's just
get this over with.

621
01:05:41,148 --> 01:05:44,786
I'm sorry to be calling so
late, but I found this necklace.

622
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:45,712
Who is this?

623
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:48,392
My name's Katherine Rose,
you don't know me.

624
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:52,530
I found this medical alert tag, and I
called the number, they connected me.

625
01:05:52,563 --> 01:05:54,166
What's
the name on the tag?

626
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,502
-Slater.
-Dorothy Slater?

627
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:58,539
Yes, she's our house
mother at the sorority.

628
01:05:58,572 --> 01:05:59,773
That's where I'm calling from.

629
01:05:59,806 --> 01:06:02,777
Yes I know the house.
is something wrong?

630
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:06,482
Well, during our party here,
one of the girls was...

631
01:06:06,515 --> 01:06:08,285
attacked...

632
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,154
that's where I found the tag.

633
01:06:10,187 --> 01:06:11,288
Where's
the girl now?

634
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:12,290
I don't know.

635
01:06:12,324 --> 01:06:14,860
She's disappeared.
Two other girls have also.

636
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:18,164
Where's Mrs. Slater?

637
01:06:18,197 --> 01:06:19,367
She's not here.

638
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:22,737
Now,
listen to me carefully.

639
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,574
I doubt anything's happened
to your friends.

640
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:26,643
But I think I'd
better come over.

641
01:06:27,176 --> 01:06:29,313
Stay in the house
until I arrive.

642
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:49,336
I don't see any.

643
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,438
Wait!

644
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:55,476
There's one over there.

645
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,492
Ok.

646
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,528
We'll dig it a couple of
feet deeper and we're set.

647
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:17,570
-All right.
-Come on.

648
01:07:41,664 --> 01:07:43,601
-Dr. Beck?
-Yes, Katherine?

649
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:47,004
-Yes, please come in.
-Thank you.

650
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:50,174
I found this in the room of one
of the girls who disappeared.

651
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:55,414
A few nights ago I heard
music coming from up here.

652
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:58,151
Mrs. Slater must have spent
a lot of time in this room.

653
01:07:58,185 --> 01:07:59,620
What else
have you found?

654
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:08,930
We have to find Mrs. Slater.

655
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:13,970
Do you know where she is?

656
01:08:21,044 --> 01:08:25,851
Why did she wear this?

657
01:08:32,557 --> 01:08:34,493
24 years ago,
she came to me.

658
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:40,166
She heard about my work with other
women, unable to bear children.

659
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,903
As risky as it was, and knowing
the odds were against her,

660
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:46,474
she went through with
the experimental procedure.

661
01:08:46,508 --> 01:08:49,511
All she ever wanted in life
was to have a child.

662
01:08:49,545 --> 01:08:51,948
What happened?

663
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,618
It was a bitter disappointment
for her, as much as for me.

664
01:08:55,652 --> 01:08:58,690
The delivery
was terribly traumatic.

665
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:04,262
Ever since then, she's been
in a world of her own.

666
01:09:04,295 --> 01:09:05,798
Who's Eric?

667
01:09:07,732 --> 01:09:08,901
Where did you hear that name?

668
01:09:08,934 --> 01:09:13,906
It's on the card, right there.

669
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:16,748
Every June 19th she
celebrates his birthday,

670
01:09:16,749 --> 01:09:20,015
as if she had a normal,
loving son.

671
01:09:20,047 --> 01:09:24,852
So that's why she always closed
the house before June 19th.

672
01:09:24,886 --> 01:09:29,026
Katherine, we've got
to find Mrs. Slater.

673
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:30,226
Where is she?

674
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:40,906
That tag, I found it in the same
spot where Jeanie was attacked.

675
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:42,341
Could Mrs. Slater have done...

676
01:09:42,374 --> 01:09:44,710
You think Mrs. Slater has something
to do with your missing friend?

677
01:09:44,743 --> 01:09:46,846
I don't know!

678
01:09:46,878 --> 01:09:50,951
There's something you're
not telling me.

679
01:09:50,985 --> 01:09:56,991
-What is it?
-My god.

680
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:35,171
All right, all right.
All right, Katherine.

681
01:10:35,204 --> 01:10:38,908
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

682
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:43,680
No!

683
01:10:43,714 --> 01:10:47,217
Three girls
at 413 Danfair Road.

684
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:50,955
That's on the Sorority Row.

685
01:10:50,988 --> 01:10:53,291
Yes, Dr. Nelson Beck!

686
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,193
Wait a minute.

687
01:10:56,228 --> 01:10:58,731
One second,
officer. What is it?

688
01:10:58,765 --> 01:11:00,301
Cemetery.

689
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:04,672
Vicki and Liz must still be
there. It's less than a mile away.

690
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:05,905
Mrs. Slater could
have followed them.

691
01:11:05,938 --> 01:11:07,643
What cemetery?

692
01:11:07,675 --> 01:11:10,678
Parkview, on Perry Street.

693
01:11:10,711 --> 01:11:12,179
Hello, officer?

694
01:11:12,214 --> 01:11:16,085
We think she may have headed for the
Parkview Cemetery on Perry Street.

695
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:18,721
Two girls are there now.

696
01:11:18,755 --> 01:11:20,858
Yes! I'll meet you there!

697
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:27,999
Is it deep enough yet?

698
01:11:28,031 --> 01:11:30,001
Yeah, that
oughta do it.

699
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:34,040
Why don't you go pull
the van around?

700
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:17,790
Liz, what
are you doing?!

701
01:12:17,824 --> 01:12:22,162
Liz?

702
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:30,906
Liz!

703
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:33,910
Shit! What are you doing?

704
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:09,119
The gun went off again.

705
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:14,058
She fell back in the water.

706
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,160
I wanted to call an ambulance,

707
01:13:16,928 --> 01:13:22,869
but we were so scared.

708
01:13:22,901 --> 01:13:28,909
We thought that she
was dead.

709
01:13:29,575 --> 01:13:34,782
The body we found must
have been Stevie's.

710
01:14:37,324 --> 01:14:39,627
He's alive.

711
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:44,933
Please, get back in the car.

712
01:14:44,965 --> 01:14:48,035
Please.

713
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:52,207
Come.

714
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:24,146
What happened to the police?

715
01:15:24,178 --> 01:15:25,381
They're not coming.

716
01:15:26,013 --> 01:15:27,482
Yes they are, they
said they were!

717
01:15:27,516 --> 01:15:30,354
What are you doing?

718
01:15:30,387 --> 01:15:34,191
Just a mild sedative.

719
01:15:34,223 --> 01:15:39,362
Please, get out of the car.

720
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,413
Come on.

721
01:15:52,446 --> 01:15:55,449
Stay there.

722
01:16:17,174 --> 01:16:25,185
Come on, come on, come on.
Get up, get up, get up.

723
01:16:49,612 --> 01:16:51,648
Stay there.
It's all right.

724
01:16:51,682 --> 01:16:56,689
Relax, Katherine.

725
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:05,199
Mrs. Slater was the last
one I used the drug on.

726
01:17:05,231 --> 01:17:09,336
Like the others, Eric was born
with certain abnormalities.

727
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:18,448
I warned her, it's what we
expected would happen.

728
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,416
Eric spent every summer away
from the clinic in the attic.

729
01:17:21,449 --> 01:17:23,721
I told Mrs. Slater that his
condition was worsening.

730
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:25,689
She wouldn't listen.

731
01:17:27,624 --> 01:17:29,527
He must have seen everything
from the attic window.

732
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:37,237
Do you understand?
I must find him.

733
01:17:37,269 --> 01:17:43,309
You're the last one of
your friends alive.

734
01:17:43,343 --> 01:17:44,345
You're the bait.

735
01:17:44,878 --> 01:17:46,613
No.

736
01:17:46,646 --> 01:17:49,284
Don't move, or make a sound.

737
01:18:29,832 --> 01:18:31,835
How are you, Katherine?

738
01:19:25,564 --> 01:19:31,572
Peter, no!

739
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:41,888
Katherine, the only way
to get Eric is to trap him.

740
01:20:52,367 --> 01:20:55,371
That boy downstairs
is only tranquilized.

741
01:20:55,404 --> 01:20:58,908
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

742
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:00,577
I've got to find him.

743
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:01,944
No one must know about him.

744
01:21:01,978 --> 01:21:08,519
I'd be ruined if anyone
knew what I did.

745
01:21:08,553 --> 01:21:12,858
I beg you.

746
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:14,993
You've got to help me.

747
01:21:15,027 --> 01:21:19,100
I must bring Eric back!

748
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:20,701
Katherine...

749
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,115
No, no!

750
01:22:58,149 --> 01:23:01,488
Mom...

751
01:23:21,944 --> 01:23:23,813
Ok.

752
01:23:23,846 --> 01:23:29,953
Ok, ok.

753
01:26:25,795 --> 01:26:28,465
Katie, it's all Vicki's fault.

754
01:26:28,499 --> 01:26:30,734
Katie, why did you
call the police?

755
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:31,904
Katie, it's your turn.

756
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,271
-We're waiting for you.
-Katie, come on.

757
01:26:34,304 --> 01:26:36,906
We're waiting. Come on.

758
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:39,341
Katie, come on.

759
01:26:39,373 --> 01:26:42,243
We won't go away, Katie.
