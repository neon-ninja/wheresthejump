1
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,878
What is that terrorist group?
What do you call that?

2
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,825
- Uh... Hamas.
- Hamas. That's right.

3
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:14,740
Throwing what missiles
and rockets into... poof!

4
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:22,299
Would you like to come over?

5
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,759
Uh, yeah, sure.

6
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:29,025
I'll grab you a chair.

7
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,773
Thanks.

8
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,458
- Oh, thanks.
- There you go.

9
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:39,308
Oh, cheers, hmm.

10
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,543
Are you South African?

11
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:45,074
Erm, no, I'm from Brisbane.

12
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,252
- Brisbane?
- Brisbane.

13
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:48,726
Where the fuck is that?

14
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:53,755
- It's in Australia.
- Oh, okay.

15
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,713
Here, watch this, right.
Watch my eyes, yeah?

16
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:02,467
Are you ready? I can do some
very freaky, crazy shit...

17
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:04,069
- With my eyes, just watch this.
- Okay.

18
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:07,528
Wow.

19
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,173
That was close! Come on.
You're not getting that? No?

20
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,327
Well, I...

21
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,601
So, er, where are you?

22
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,964
Come on...

23
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,943
It actually means that
you have a lack of calcium.

24
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,641
No, it means I've been
drinking too much beer.

25
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:24,729
That's what it means.

26
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:28,509
- You want some?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:36,229
- Take care. See you.
- Yeah.

28
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,326
<i>Adieu.</i> See you later.

29
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,248
- Bye.
- Bye.

30
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,752
Is there a lid for this?

31
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:48,809
Or should I just...

32
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,397
Okay, okay...

33
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:56,240
- Thank you.
<i>- Danke.</i>

34
00:06:58,163 --> 00:07:00,341
<i>- Tschuss.
- Tschuss.</i>

35
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,036
No, no, no. That's okay.
Do you mind?

36
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,150
Thank you.

37
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:16,929
Help yourself.

38
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,965
My father grows them in
a<i> schrebergarten.</i>

39
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,464
In, uh, cardboard boxes?

40
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,777
No, these are from the store.

41
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,653
Do you like strawberries?

42
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:29,903
Um...

43
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:32,273
They help you
forget your problems.

44
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,996
What makes you think
I have problems?

45
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,006
People who travel alone...

46
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,896
Are usually in search
of something, aren't they?

47
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:42,811
What makes you think
that I'm alone?

48
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,207
I see nobody.

49
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,827
Do you always
practice your English...

50
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,460
Chatting up foreigners?

51
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,414
What? No. No.

52
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,354
I work in a sport school.

53
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:58,763
What sort of sports?

54
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,230
I mean, I'm an English
teacher, that's why.

55
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:06,034
And you? What are you
photographing?

56
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:08,950
Buildings, mostly.

57
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:13,017
I, ahh... I really like the
GDR architecture.

58
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,939
I wanna do a book.

59
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:18,463
We say DDR,<i> Deutsche</i>
<i>Demokratische Republik.</i>

60
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:20,417
Yeah. No, I know.

61
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:23,428
Yeah.

62
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,063
And, it was nice to meet you.
There's strawberry on my hand.

63
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:41,590
- Andi.
- Clare.

64
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:44,441
Nice to meet you.

65
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:49,374
What did you...

66
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:51,424
You said this was, er,
from a<i> schreber...</i>

67
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,313
<i>Schreber.</i> I don't know
the English word for it.

68
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,300
Erm, these are small gardens.

69
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,094
All together and
all with German flags...

70
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:02,956
And those, er, small men
from<i> Snow White.</i>

71
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,614
Dwarfs.
Yeah, dwarfs.

72
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:24,673
Who lives
in these houses?

73
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:28,710
No one. Actually,
it's forbidden.

74
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,503
They just come on weekends.

75
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,522
It's my mum.

76
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,205
She's kind of obsessed.

77
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,743
Does she know you're here?

78
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,786
Yeah.

79
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,911
My mother used to
bring me here as a boy.

80
00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:00,613
I always come here to
complicate life.

81
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:04,970
What?

82
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:09,967
Erm, I think you mean to,
er, you'd say "contemplate."

83
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,785
Oh, yeah, right.

84
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,707
How do you say
"complicate" in German?

85
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,077
<i>Verkomplizieren.</i>

86
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:23,676
This one is nice, huh?

87
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:26,143
Yeah, I like it.

88
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,064
Oh!

89
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,634
Fuck! Oh, my gosh.

90
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:31,043
Sorry.

91
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,703
Yeah, he likes you.

92
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:39,148
Hi. Hi!

93
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:43,696
Oh, my God.

94
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:46,483
So, why did you
come to Berlin?

95
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:49,814
Er, I was working for
a real estate company...

96
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:52,057
Taking photos and, erm...

97
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,940
You know, those life
experiences...

98
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:56,925
That people talk about
all the time?

99
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:59,040
I wanted to do that, so, I...

100
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:03,588
I booked a ticket and put my
stuff in storage...

101
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,542
And came here.

102
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,474
Pretty predictable.

103
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:14,351
I don't know.
Maybe brave.

104
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:21,878
A wolf.

105
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:55,128
There's a bar upstairs,
erm, if you wanted to...

106
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,708
Come... actually, it's more like
a... kinda crappy rooftop.

107
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm afraid I have to
meet someone.

108
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,666
- Otherwise, I...
- Yeah.

109
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,940
Yeah, I have to...

110
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,286
I've got stuff I have to do.

111
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,873
I gotta pack. I'm going
Dresden tomorrow.

112
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,122
Dresden?

113
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:15,660
Yeah.

114
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,870
Why Dresden?

115
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,086
Okay.

116
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,642
<i>Tschuss,</i> Clare.

117
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:49,710
It's nice to meet you.

118
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,755
<i>Hello?</i>

119
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:13,254
Hi. Can you open?

120
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,945
That one's my favorite.

121
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:05,718
She's holding her hands
like that...

122
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,864
To hide her deformed finger.

123
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:38,551
I thought you wanted to leave.

124
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,598
So, if you have a question,
you Google it.

125
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,064
Yeah.

126
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:52,100
Yeah, I'm... I'm definitely
partial toward Google.

127
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:54,374
Are you not?

128
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:57,962
You photograph disappointment.

129
00:16:57,964 --> 00:17:02,703
I mean, all this DDR shit,
all these dreams...

130
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:06,418
It's all... invalid.

131
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,078
But the people were brave.

132
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,223
Mm. Some were brave,
some just got on with it.

133
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:15,196
I mean, you can suffocate
anywhere. You don't need a wall.

134
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,310
How do you say suffocate
in German?

135
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,680
Uh...

136
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:22,851
<i>Ersticken.</i>

137
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,228
- Sticken?
- No. No.<i> Erwurgen.</i> No.

138
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:27,880
<i>Erwurgen</i> is...

139
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:31,756
- To choke.
- Yeah.

140
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:37,457
Did a boy give you that?

141
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:45,882
No, my mum... did.

142
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:49,597
She said if I ever got
into trouble...

143
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,417
I could hock it and come home.

144
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,406
Watch the door.
It sticks.

145
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,628
So quiet.

146
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,151
Berlin is full
of these empty places.

147
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,418
Do you want a drink?

148
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,987
Yeah. Thanks.

149
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:15,087
They don't open.

150
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:21,493
Should I make us dinner?

151
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:13,697
No one will hear you.

152
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:30,994
I don't want this to end.

153
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,568
All firsts end.

154
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,668
First airplane ride.

155
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,424
First time you get
your ears pierced.

156
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:46,178
First drags of cigarettes.

157
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:49,926
First fuck.

158
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:58,639
I wish we could stay
like this...

159
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,368
Where we don't know
each other.

160
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,134
I wish I could stay.

161
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:11,323
What happens when you
know someone?

162
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,220
You can see all the ugliness.

163
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:19,331
What did you just say?

164
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:25,449
I love your accent.

165
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:33,296
I love your mouth, your smile.

166
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,209
I love everything.

167
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:06,867
Silke, may I ask you
to please read the quote?

168
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:11,095
"Perhaps home is not a place,
but simply..."

169
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:17,661
Erm... "An irrevocable condition"?

170
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:20,224
Bennie, I see you obviously...

171
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:24,100
Consumed this book
on the weekend.

172
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:28,008
Yeah. Okay, I'll make it
easy for you, erm...

173
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,645
James Baldwin wrote this in 1956
in his novel<i> Giovanni's Room.</i>

174
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:34,862
Who has made a start on it?

175
00:25:35,728 --> 00:25:36,752
Hm?

176
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:39,411
Franka?

177
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,280
Erm...

178
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:48,284
Er, the character
is constantly moving.

179
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:53,120
He feels a little bit shame
about, erm, about himself...

180
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:57,765
But he says he is, erm,
finding himself...

181
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:02,602
But he's just...

182
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,781
<i>- Flichten?</i>
- Mm. Escaping.

183
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:06,991
Yeah. He's just escaping.

184
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:39,787
What the fuck?

185
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:50,454
Andi.

186
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:51,503
Are you coming for a drink?

187
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,422
No, I can't. I need to get home.

188
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,220
Why?

189
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,777
I'm meeting someone.

190
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,462
I thought you needed
to get home?

191
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,460
Yes... to get changed.

192
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,581
Stop hassling him.
He's got a date.

193
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,906
Next time. I promise, okay?

194
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,623
You said that last week, too.

195
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,744
Yes, but I didn't mean it then.

196
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:27,707
Couldn't find the key.

197
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:29,629
Did you leave me a key?

198
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,839
Yeah.

199
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:33,729
Sure.

200
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,406
I thought I'd left it
on the table.

201
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:41,513
No.

202
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:44,011
I didn't... I didn't think I
would be able to get back in.

203
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,958
And then I realized
that I couldn't even leave.

204
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,001
You can leave now.
I'll take a shower.

205
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:52,276
Did you lock me in?

206
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,721
Yes, sure.

207
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:03,807
But next time,
I'll tie you to the bed.

208
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:50,286
- I have to go.
- Hey.

209
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,503
The key.

210
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:52,656
It's on the dresser.

211
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:56,308
Okay.

212
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:04,344
"Mine."

213
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,255
Shit. Come on.

214
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,818
Erm, I was actually gonna go.
Erm...

215
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,374
Yeah, I was thinking
about going...

216
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:28,680
And I'll come back
and get my backpack later.

217
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:31,467
I got you these.

218
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:34,766
Please open the door.

219
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,300
What's all this?

220
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:44,055
Please, Andi.

221
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:52,544
Where's my sim card, Andi?

222
00:33:58,823 --> 00:34:00,744
What did you do to the windows?

223
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:03,531
They're reinforced.

224
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:06,830
If you try to break them,
I'll have to board them up.

225
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:10,962
I just bought these chairs.

226
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,962
Don't do that.

227
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:47,767
You don't have to do this.

228
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:00,900
Andi, what is going on?

229
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,569
"What is going on?"

230
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,264
You could have gone
to Dresden.

231
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,211
You said you want to stay.

232
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,201
We had sex.

233
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:29,600
People... people say
all sorts of things in bed.

234
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:36,423
It doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

235
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,072
Please, dear God.

236
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,767
Do you like pesto?

237
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,482
What?

238
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:05,156
Can we just go for dinner?

239
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,656
Can I have my necklace back?

240
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,739
Open the fucking door!

241
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:44,555
Ssh!

242
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:49,264
No one can hear you.

243
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:10,217
Here we have two characters
in parallel narratives.

244
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:17,182
But the protagonist in Steinberg's work is drowning
in the author's obstinate reliance on detail.

245
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,698
As if the scent of a
long gone perfume...

246
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:32,380
or the mention of margarine from GDR times somehow
invests his character's life with authenticity.

247
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,743
This is very different with
Erpenbeck.

248
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:41,936
She is less fixated on objects
than on fate.

249
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:44,146
She writes about death.

250
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:51,859
That death robs people of all
possibilities imaginable.

251
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:02,045
My son.

252
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,097
We constantly argue about the
Unrechtsstaat.

253
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,498
My son is of the opinion that the GDR
was a state devoid of any justice.

254
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,938
Next time you want to talk about me
and my opinions in front of others...

255
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,987
Then warn me please because
it bothers me.

256
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,422
You know what bothers me?

257
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,857
That the lectures are reduced
to summaries...

258
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,867
Idiotic précis.

259
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,302
Coffee breaks...

260
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,137
Ridiculous.

261
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,265
Let me.

262
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,094
It's all right.

263
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,100
Let me.

264
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,338
You were late today.

265
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,106
Yes.

266
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,498
I met someone, Papa.

267
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,261
What about Natalie?

268
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,182
I've told you.

269
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,025
She's gone back to Canada.

270
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,702
You didn't tell me anything.

271
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,341
What's her name?

272
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,740
Clare.

273
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,620
Is she German?

274
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,740
Australian.

275
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,462
Why do you always choose
tourists?

276
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,104
She is not a tourist. She lives
here now.

277
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,094
I told my father about us.

278
00:41:14,874 --> 00:41:17,532
Here... I got you these.

279
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,177
I thought you might like
to do puzzle.

280
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:32,170
Would you like
to eat something?

281
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:39,954
I texted your mother for you.

282
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:45,848
You told her you're okay.

283
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:49,115
But I'm not okay.

284
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:11,217
I pay for drinks on my card.

285
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:17,400
My mum's gonna work it out.

286
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:33,256
Oh, my God.

287
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,864
There's nowhere for me to go.

288
00:43:54,393 --> 00:43:55,449
Shit.

289
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,660
How was your date?

290
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,179
Which... which date?

291
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,382
The one just recently.

292
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,181
Come on tell me!

293
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:40,743
Jana, Jana.

294
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,058
Yes?

295
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,616
I think you've got my cup.

296
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,343
Sorry.

297
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,957
I didn't know that it was yours.
I'm sorry.

298
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,498
It's okay.

299
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,941
I'll wash it.

300
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,901
It's not a problem.

301
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,015
I'm sorry, Andi.

302
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,388
Come on. Let me.

303
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,457
I'll do it.

304
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,056
Sorry.

305
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,135
Thanks.

306
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:56,211
Hi.

307
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:05,596
I can't figure out this bit.

308
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,230
Erm...

309
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:11,746
I would always do the sky first.

310
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:13,444
Can you help?

311
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:19,497
Yeah, I think that piece
goes there.

312
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:37,244
I think it goes
somewhere in there.

313
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:43,010
Mm-hm.

314
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:45,956
Yeah. There.

315
00:46:46,438 --> 00:46:48,807
Done.

316
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,286
Ssh-ssh.

317
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,092
It's alright.

318
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,935
Stay calm.

319
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,700
Your mother would like to
see you.

320
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,776
Why?

321
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,615
You're her son.

322
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,907
She called.

323
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,580
She left us.

324
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,974
Defected.

325
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,427
I don't want to see her.

326
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,986
How many stitches?

327
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,617
Twelve.

328
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,662
Let me see!

329
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,019
It's okay, Papa.

330
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,097
I just want to have a look.

331
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,337
Like Jesus.

332
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,214
How did you do this?

333
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,780
When I was renovating...

334
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,894
I slipped with the chisel...

335
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,660
You shouldn't cover it.

336
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,700
It's infected.

337
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,340
Leave it!

338
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,665
If you want to renovate, I can
give you the number of someone.

339
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,783
Can we just continue to play?

340
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,140
Please.

341
00:50:29,508 --> 00:50:31,427
I miss my mom.

342
00:50:33,256 --> 00:50:35,978
There's no point in missing
something you can't have back.

343
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,893
You have me.

344
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:09,611
You could do so many things.

345
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:14,705
But I just want to do this.

346
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:01,376
Okay, now<i> funf.</i>

347
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,779
That was very good.

348
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,738
Team.

349
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,740
Work.

350
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:52,847
Shit.

351
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:05,115
Come on.

352
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,244
Shit.

353
00:54:19,594 --> 00:54:20,586
Oh, God.

354
00:55:03,703 --> 00:55:04,886
Better?

355
00:55:08,476 --> 00:55:09,436
Yeah.

356
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:14,624
Shall we take that off?

357
00:55:23,082 --> 00:55:25,066
I smell bad.

358
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,774
What would be the worst thing
I could ever do to you?

359
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:55,914
Don't worry...
I would never do it.

360
00:56:01,616 --> 00:56:03,505
We are a team.

361
00:56:53,636 --> 00:56:54,885
Hello.

362
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,097
Mr. Werner?

363
00:56:59,145 --> 00:57:02,284
If you say anything,
I will have to kill her.

364
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,580
Understand?

365
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,100
Franka.

366
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,936
What are you doing here?

367
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,660
Are you alone?

368
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,380
How did you get my address?

369
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,064
I was close by and saw you.

370
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,625
I'm not a stalker.

371
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,974
The coal man let me in.

372
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,335
So you followed me?

373
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,344
Hello.

374
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,668
Who is that?

375
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,660
My girlfriend.

376
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,652
You looked at me. I saw you.

377
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,300
You kept looking at me.

378
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,984
Sometimes we do things...

379
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,142
without being conscious of it.

380
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,342
I don't know what you mean?

381
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,862
I think you know what I mean.

382
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,258
Yes I looked. Yes...

383
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,180
Because you made a spectacle of
yourself.

384
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,581
If you do this again, I'll
report you.

385
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,937
Don't make me do that.

386
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:38,508
Who's that?

387
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,865
Student.

388
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:45,427
What's her name?

389
00:58:46,677 --> 00:58:48,022
Franka.

390
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,357
Turn around.

391
00:59:27,936 --> 00:59:30,944
Clare? The door won't open.

392
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,923
Clare?

393
00:59:36,134 --> 00:59:38,280
Did you touch this door?

394
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:40,810
Clare?

395
01:00:47,406 --> 01:00:48,751
Huh?

396
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:23,665
Can you please... stop?

397
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:25,395
- Yeah.
- Please.

398
01:01:28,504 --> 01:01:29,751
Boom, boom, boom!

399
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:37,791
Can't you just be normal?

400
01:01:39,874 --> 01:01:42,564
You're abnormal.

401
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:20,938
Fuck.

402
01:02:51,658 --> 01:02:52,714
Andreas.

403
01:03:29,391 --> 01:03:30,768
Fuck.

404
01:04:30,348 --> 01:04:31,981
Papa.

405
01:04:31,983 --> 01:04:33,574
You were supposed to wake me.

406
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:37,010
Hey.

407
01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:42,648
Papa?

408
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,744
Hello Stefan... It's me.

409
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,939
Sorry, I should have called.

410
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,784
Yes, my father has died.

411
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,786
A few days ago.

412
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,094
Okay.

413
01:09:55,857 --> 01:09:57,106
My father's dead.

414
01:10:05,275 --> 01:10:07,421
I thought you weren't
gonna come back.

415
01:12:42,264 --> 01:12:43,801
Thank you.

416
01:13:01,066 --> 01:13:03,212
How did you choose me?

417
01:13:05,775 --> 01:13:07,888
You paused on the street.

418
01:13:11,989 --> 01:13:13,622
What was I looking at?

419
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:29,126
And what about the other girl
before me?

420
01:13:30,248 --> 01:13:32,649
How did you choose her?

421
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:34,251
There was no other girl.

422
01:13:36,206 --> 01:13:38,864
You're lying.

423
01:13:51,325 --> 01:13:53,374
Do you still think about her?

424
01:13:56,097 --> 01:13:57,603
No.

425
01:14:01,223 --> 01:14:02,535
How come?

426
01:14:18,168 --> 01:14:20,153
When you were a kid, did you
guys have a fake tree...

427
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,754
Or a real one?

428
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,104
Real.

429
01:14:32,518 --> 01:14:35,080
You know, we had a...

430
01:14:35,082 --> 01:14:38,026
We had a... a fake.

431
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:40,909
It was so hot anyway that...

432
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:44,048
that a real tree would
have died.

433
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:48,245
And we would go out
to my uncle's house.

434
01:14:48,247 --> 01:14:49,750
He has this, like,
big property...

435
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:03,203
...listening to, er, cicadas.

436
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:05,029
Cicadas?

437
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:11,051
Erm, they're these little
bugs that make noise.

438
01:15:15,441 --> 01:15:16,721
Like, erm...

439
01:15:16,723 --> 01:15:18,676
They go...

440
01:15:20,887 --> 01:15:22,616
And then the other one goes...

441
01:15:22,617 --> 01:15:24,121
...back and...

442
01:15:24,123 --> 01:15:25,755
And it goes...

443
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,552
Then he goes...

444
01:15:33,955 --> 01:15:36,197
And then all their
friends join in.

445
01:15:42,797 --> 01:15:44,461
Close your eyes.

446
01:15:48,146 --> 01:15:50,643
Close your eyes.
I have a surprise for you.

447
01:16:05,058 --> 01:16:07,460
This is Lotte.
She is yours now.

448
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:08,613
Hi.

449
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,265
Hi.

450
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:16,397
Oh. She kissed me on my mouth.

451
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:21,041
Hi. Hi.

452
01:16:23,862 --> 01:16:25,270
Do you like your present?

453
01:16:26,136 --> 01:16:27,832
Yeah.

454
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:32,893
Yeah. She is so sweet.

455
01:17:06,976 --> 01:17:09,153
Do you like it?

456
01:17:09,155 --> 01:17:10,179
Yes.

457
01:18:24,014 --> 01:18:27,728
Ow! Ow.

458
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:35,305
My brother hurt his leg.

459
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,174
What are you doing here?

460
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:39,900
Are you by yourself?

461
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:40,900
Yes.

462
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,062
Can you get up?

463
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,147
Yes.

464
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,107
You need to help me.

465
01:18:47,109 --> 01:18:48,933
You need to help me.
You need to call the police.

466
01:18:48,935 --> 01:18:51,336
Please, he's a bad man.
He will hurt us.

467
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,929
Let me go.
I don't understand you.

468
01:18:53,932 --> 01:18:56,108
What? No. You need to help me.
Call the police.

469
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,450
I don't understand you.

470
01:18:57,452 --> 01:18:58,604
I need you to. He's a bad man.

471
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,023
Let me go.

472
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,233
Benni.

473
01:19:10,235 --> 01:19:11,260
Mama!

474
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,579
My mother is coming.

475
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,261
Everything is alright.

476
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,900
Your boy just fell.

477
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,492
Thank you.

478
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,538
No problem.

479
01:19:56,265 --> 01:19:59,916
How do you think this is going,
from one to ten?

480
01:20:03,473 --> 01:20:04,977
From one to ten?

481
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:06,707
Us.

482
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:12,857
Maybe...

483
01:20:16,477 --> 01:20:17,534
Er...

484
01:20:20,193 --> 01:20:21,249
Seven.

485
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:27,176
Hm.

486
01:21:46,744 --> 01:21:48,505
Where's Lotte?

487
01:21:48,507 --> 01:21:49,786
She ran away.

488
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,705
Second floor.

489
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:16,256
I can't believe you made it.

490
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,414
Everything alright?

491
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,583
Come in.

492
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,495
You didn't tell me that
it was a party.

493
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,297
I didn't tell you that
it was a party?

494
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,105
Sorry.

495
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,817
How were your holidays?

496
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,464
Andi.

497
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,700
Leave it.

498
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,342
You don't have to wash up.
We can do it later.

499
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,334
Come. It's twelve.

500
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:44,022
Does Peter mind you acting
like this?

501
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,345
What are you talking about?

502
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:50,816
The way you throw yourself
at men.

503
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,060
What?

504
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,499
Why are you like this?

505
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,412
Why are you like this?

506
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:13,222
I want you to go, okay!

507
01:27:02,419 --> 01:27:05,845
Oh... thank you.

508
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:07,031
No problem.

509
01:27:13,983 --> 01:27:17,185
What's your
New Year's resolution?

510
01:27:17,187 --> 01:27:19,780
Oh, I don't do them any more.

511
01:27:19,782 --> 01:27:21,702
But on New Year's Eve...

512
01:27:21,704 --> 01:27:24,520
Isn't it important to compensate
your life?

513
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:27,692
What?

514
01:27:27,694 --> 01:27:31,311
I think you mean, uh,
"contemplate."

515
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:33,201
Yeah, right.

516
01:28:41,366 --> 01:28:42,902
Hey!

517
01:28:44,249 --> 01:28:46,939
Fuck. Hey!

518
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:06,446
Help!

519
01:29:17,658 --> 01:29:18,874
No.

520
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:42,354
Help! Help!

521
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,628
Help!

522
01:29:50,555 --> 01:29:53,982
Help! Help!

523
01:29:53,984 --> 01:29:55,872
- Hello?
- The door's locked!

524
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:00,035
- The door's locked!
- <i>What?</i>

525
01:31:09,226 --> 01:31:11,242
Hey... hey, listen to me.

526
01:31:13,871 --> 01:31:15,951
It's your fucking fault, okay.

527
01:31:15,953 --> 01:31:17,969
Now we have to clean
this mess together.

528
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:20,564
Okay?

529
01:31:20,566 --> 01:31:23,864
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, come here.

530
01:31:23,865 --> 01:31:25,304
I am sorry.

531
01:31:27,485 --> 01:31:29,373
- Take the plastic.
- I can't.

532
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,815
Take the plastic.

533
01:31:46,511 --> 01:31:47,792
Come on, take your clothes off.

534
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,244
Please.

535
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,742
"TOURIST MISSING"

536
01:34:32,052 --> 01:34:35,479
Hey, can you pack your
things together?

537
01:34:36,793 --> 01:34:39,643
Pack everything in a backpack.

538
01:34:39,645 --> 01:34:41,661
I get the apartment
fumigated tomorrow.

539
01:35:04,661 --> 01:35:06,070
Pack your things.

540
01:35:37,847 --> 01:35:38,935
What're you doing?

541
01:35:42,363 --> 01:35:44,828
Agh!

542
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,622
The cream's in the bathroom.

543
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:55,815
I can't find it.

544
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:57,993
It's on the bottom shelf.

545
01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:29,445
My thoughts.

546
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:45,700
You're welcome.

547
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:03,863
May I go to the toilet?

548
01:38:09,165 --> 01:38:12,272
Guys, please...
Class is not over yet.

549
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,784
What are you doing?

550
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,978
What's that?

551
01:41:10,018 --> 01:41:11,362
Clare?

552
01:41:43,267 --> 01:41:44,515
Clare?

553
01:42:29,105 --> 01:42:30,482
I'm down here.

554
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:08,600
Clare?

555
01:43:38,326 --> 01:43:39,959
Andi.

556
01:44:01,870 --> 01:44:04,271
Clare?

557
01:44:04,273 --> 01:44:06,866
