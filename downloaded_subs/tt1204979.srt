1
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,543
Hey, hey, you're gonna kill us.

2
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,052
If I wreck my brother's car...
Let's just wait.

3
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,282
No, I can't wait.
You can't wait either.

4
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,761
I told you to take it easy
with that champagne.

5
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,725
- You take it easy with...
- Hey! Hey!

6
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,799
Okay.

7
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,213
- You're on private property.
- Sorry, we're just lost.

8
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,589
And you figured she might have a map
tucked up under that dress.

9
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,989
Don't feed me that bullshit.
I know what's going on.

10
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,457
Go do it someplace else.

11
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,966
Hello?

12
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,371
Hello?

13
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,703
- Evening.
- Hey, what's going on, man?

14
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,711
We're on our way down to Danville.

15
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,646
I was wondering if you had a room
where we could rest up?

16
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,650
Maybe like an hourly deal
or something?

17
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,880
Sorry. It's nightly rates only.

18
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,084
But I do have a nice room
for you to rest up.

19
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,887
Cool.

20
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,298
Baby, hurry up!

21
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,442
Baby!

22
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,078
- Come on!
- Keep the change.

23
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,309
Honeymoon suite.

24
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,048
Hurry up.

25
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,393
Let's get to work.

26
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,217
I wasn't shy before we were married.
No reason to start now.

27
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,609
Come on.

28
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,190
- What happened?
- I don't know.

29
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,365
What's going on?

30
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,240
It's okay, babe.

31
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,173
- I don't know. Old wires maybe.
- That was freaky.

32
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,932
We should go back to the car.

33
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,907
Are you kidding me? Now?

34
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,910
Come on, I'm dying here.
Come on, babe.

35
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,776
Please?

36
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:04,518
Remember, till death do us part?

37
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,903
That got a better view.

38
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,067
Newlyweds are always the best.

39
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,039
Newlyweds and cheating husbands.

40
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,417
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming.

41
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,116
Hey, hey, get your feet off the dash!

42
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,400
Hang on, babe! Hang on!

43
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,027
That kid better slow down a bit.

44
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,417
Hustle back and fold up the sheets
in case we got another.

45
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,666
Welcome to the Meadow View.

46
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,809
I'd like a single for the night.

47
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,370
Got a room open.

48
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,442
- Can I have a print of your ID?
- I left my ID in the car.

49
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,210
The name's Smith.

50
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,216
Not a problem.

51
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,898
You know, I think the pipes
are backed up in 2.

52
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,004
It's number 6. Down on the end.

53
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,901
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Smith.

54
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,177
I'm in lousy shape, man.

55
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,869
I couldn't even make her out.
Is she worth watching?

56
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,746
You gotta put in a new microphone.

57
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,655
- Yeah.
- We can barely hear this.

58
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,287
He don't...
He don't trust your housekeeping.

59
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,357
Probably one of them germ freaks.

60
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,896
<i>Where do you want me?</i>

61
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,264
<i>I want you on the bed.</i>

62
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,041
<i>Face down.</i>

63
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,273
<i>Should I take this off
so it doesn't get wet?</i>

64
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,423
What...? What is that?

65
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,553
I can get you a hundred copies
by the morning.

66
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,082
Make it 25.

67
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,416
Sales are slow.

68
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,254
Same old shit. It's getting old.

69
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,759
Are you kidding me?

70
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,931
Look at her.

71
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,965
What you have here is classic.

72
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,802
Twenty-five.

73
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,082
- What's going on?
- We have a problem.

74
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,310
- Reece!
- This guy...

75
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,292
- What's the problem?
- It's nothing we can't handle.

76
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,361
Jesus.

77
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,635
What the hell is this? This shit real?

78
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,300
Oh, yeah.

79
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,940
Damn.

80
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,877
Where's this guy here?
Right... That dude.

81
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,217
We have no idea what to do with him.

82
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,474
Did he know her?

83
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,182
Who's the lady?

84
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,785
She must have killed herself
when I checked in.

85
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,926
You in the habit
of murdering strange women?

86
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,364
We got it all on video.

87
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,795
All of it. Everything.

88
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,599
Just my luck, huh?
A couple of peeping Toms.

89
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,924
Should we call the cops?

90
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,394
This is... This is a murder scene.

91
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,898
You call the cops, all right,
they start asking questions.

92
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,231
You run the risk
of exposing your operation.

93
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,038
We could kill him.

94
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,613
We yank the camera.

95
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,285
We heard screams,
but we couldn't get there in time.

96
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,513
- Or you could untie me.
- What was that?

97
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,624
You could untie me.

98
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,118
Put my skills to use.

99
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,170
You've got a...

100
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:54,378
You've got a setup here.
It's a real moneymaker.

101
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,815
Nobody buys porn anymore.

102
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,646
But killing...

103
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,121
Killing is different, you know.

104
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,349
Watching somebody die...

105
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,587
...I mean, that's rare. It's valuable.

106
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,096
We could work together.

107
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,905
We could sell 10,000 copies easy.

108
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,887
Well, you know...

109
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,029
...there is a market
for this type of deal.

110
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,036
As soon as we untie him
he's gonna take off.

111
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,264
Getting paid to kill. What better deal
am I gonna get than that?

112
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,943
Who said anything
about getting paid?

113
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,444
Well, I am doing the dirty work.
I get equal cut.

114
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,776
You got big demands
for a fella tied to a chair.

115
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,681
Equal.

116
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,784
Otherwise, wrap me up with her
when you're finished.

117
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,385
Give me the knife.

118
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,639
Gordon, what's to keep him
from wrapping us up in plastic?

119
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,586
You get out of line...

120
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,254
...someone anonymously drops
that tape off to the police.

121
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,925
He's gonna have another copy,
so if something happens to us...

122
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,731
...well, he'll take care of the rest.

123
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,868
Now, let's get something straight.

124
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,002
I run the show here.

125
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,606
I wouldn't have it any other way.

126
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,324
Are you sure about this?

127
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:03,124
If it doesn't work,
empty your shotgun into him.

128
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:11,365
Let's shut down for a few days.
Get everything in order.

129
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,882
Let's go bury
our first star someplace.

130
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,586
Eight hundred miles.

131
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,561
It's a long way from home.

132
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,466
Home is where the heart is, Caleb.

133
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,197
Don't you ever forget that.

134
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,571
I thought you were serious.
I was about to jump out.

135
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,109
Don't do that. They might not
find your body out here for weeks.

136
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,088
This was a mistake.

137
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,285
You're over-thinking again.
Everything is gonna be fine.

138
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,760
I mean, what if your father
doesn't like me?

139
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,263
Why would he not like you?
You're almost perfect.

140
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,596
- Almost?
- Yeah.

141
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,570
Yeah, everything except for
that weird sideburn defect you have.

142
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,776
- Hey, my sideburns.
- They're never even.

143
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,777
You don't know the difference between
a socket and crescent wrench.

144
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,111
And there's that little issue of you
stealing his only daughter away, but...

145
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,152
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Oh, Jesus.

146
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,080
This is such a mistake.

147
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,262
Yes, this is a mistake! So turn back.

148
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,931
Go back now, dude.
Let's just go back. Let's go home.

149
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,965
You promised you were gonna be
sleeping the rest of the way.

150
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,603
How can I sleep
when my best friend is about to...

151
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,898
...disappears into
the Virginia wilderness?

152
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,438
- It's North Carolina.
- Same difference.

153
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,841
All outhouses and corn bread
and damn AM radio.

154
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,279
- You're an idiot, you know that?
- That's irrelevant.

155
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,351
I bet you that at some time
during your youth out here...

156
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,682
...your old man taught you
how to hunt.

157
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,121
Didn't he? Come on, tell the truth.
I know you know how to hunt.

158
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,727
Right? Come on, didn't he?

159
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,227
Hunting does not
make somebody a hillbilly.

160
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,866
I knew it.
I told you, what'd I tell you?

161
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,395
Why are you even here?

162
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,572
To help my boy Caleb
with all this shit back here, remember?

163
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,539
Because you're not supposed to do any
heavy lifting in your present condition.

164
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,506
Reason number 27 why Daddy's
not gonna think you're perfect, dude.

165
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,685
He's just messing with you.

166
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,717
Tell her you're just fucking around.

167
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,254
- I am just fucking around, man.
- Thanks.

168
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,356
So, what's our ETA into Hooterville?

169
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,693
A few more hours, Tanner.

170
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,829
Well, I'm not the smartest guy, but it
might not be the best first impression...

171
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,167
...waking up the family
at 3 in the morning.

172
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,974
- What do you think, Jess?
- Whatever you want, babe.

173
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:41,384
It'd give me a chance to shower.
Even out these sideburns.

174
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,779
You know what?

175
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,981
You're right.

176
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,186
It's going to be perfect.

177
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,228
Meadow View, great.

178
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,066
Add it to the list of other
high-class motels we passed.

179
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,970
Prairie View, River View,
Mountain View.

180
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,008
Somebody should come up
with Titty View.

181
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,613
Now, that is a joint
I wouldn't mind staying in.

182
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,784
That sounds nice. Titty View.

183
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,183
You have to make it so easy
for her to see you're an idiot?

184
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,323
- What?
- Stop trying to press her buttons.

185
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:57,119
It's hard not to, dude. There's just
so many damn buttons to push.

186
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,529
Hey. Tanner's just pissed
because I'm leaving.

187
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,324
All right? Don't worry about it.

188
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,695
We've been hanging out
since the first grade.

189
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,700
I'm like the only friend he's got.

190
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,065
That's a shocker.

191
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,298
Why don't you remind him
that you guys aren't 8 anymore?

192
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,674
Meadow View.

193
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,716
Hello?

194
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,016
Hello?

195
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,097
Sorry for the wait.

196
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,895
A little too much iced tea tonight.

197
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,169
No problem.
We're just looking to grab a room.

198
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,707
Oh, we have some of those.

199
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,875
It's for the two of you?

200
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,416
The couples' rate is 49 a night.
Includes air and cable.

201
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,183
- Well, we actually need...
- No, that's it. Sounds good.

202
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,567
Where are you folks moving from?

203
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,070
The trailer.

204
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,639
Oh, yeah. Chicago.

205
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,406
We're on our way to Beulah.
That's where my family's from.

206
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,549
Oh, you're not far now.
It's beautiful, very peaceful.

207
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,743
Feels like you're in
the middle of nowhere.

208
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,753
- Great.
- So you're in room 6.

209
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,424
Just down near the end.

210
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,786
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

211
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,585
I hope you enjoy your stay.

212
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,288
And if you need anything,
don't hesitate to scream.

213
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,609
So we get to have a room
with Tanner again.

214
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,405
We'll stick him on the floor.
It's only for a couple hours.

215
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,947
Where'd he go now?

216
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,252
We didn't pass any bars
coming in, did we?

217
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:12,556
No, not that I saw. But he has, like,
a special radar for those places.

218
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,287
Fuck him, he'll find us.

219
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,276
Oh, God. See that squirrel?

220
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,517
That was gross.

221
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,327
Oh, my God. What a mess.

222
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,099
It'll be fine.
We'll fix it when we get there.

223
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,037
Yeah.

224
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,278
You up for a little dip before bed?

225
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,007
It's all yours. Go first.

226
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,119
The least we could do
is grab the squirrel for your dad.

227
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,620
Save him having to
hunt down lunch tomorrow.

228
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,383
I'll tell him that you said that.

229
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,527
Did I mention he's 6'5"
and used to box?

230
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,187
- Oh, that's it. You're going in.
- No, Caleb! No, no, no!

231
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,142
This is actually pretty nice.

232
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,212
Yeah, it's not bad.

233
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:47,514
Better tell Tanner not to make
a big entrance when he shows up.

234
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:53,193
- I got nothing.
- Yeah, me either.

235
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,389
It's the middle of nowhere.

236
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:59,399
Why do you need to call him anyway?
He'll find us. He always does.

237
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,731
Let's hurry.

238
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,034
We don't want to waste
what little privacy we've got.

239
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,383
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing?

240
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,851
We'll get cell-phone reception
as soon as we get into town, I promise.

241
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,389
No, I'm talking about
everything else.

242
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,758
Living around your family,
me working for your father.

243
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,828
Chicago's not going
anywhere, Caleb.

244
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,304
And if you're not happy,
we'll go back.

245
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,702
What if you're happy?

246
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,901
I won't be. Not if you're not.

247
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,951
"If you need anything, just scream"?

248
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,414
What?

249
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,291
Didn't it seem like
a weird thing for that guy to say?

250
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,394
I don't know, it's the same as,
"If you need anything, just yell. "

251
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,101
Scream is different.

252
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,736
You're over-thinking again.

253
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,579
Sexy.

254
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,091
What is that?

255
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,527
I don't know.

256
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,600
Shit!

257
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,139
There's nobody out there.

258
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,679
- Shit!
- Caleb, wait!

259
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,688
Fuck! Caleb!

260
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,051
Caleb, open the door, man. Shit!

261
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,283
What the hell are you doing?

262
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,554
Counting the broken bones in my hand.
What's the matter with you?

263
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,222
I gave you the whole big warning knock
and everything. Shit!

264
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,694
- We didn't know who it was.
- Well, who else would it be, man?

265
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,565
Man, I think you gave me
a concussion too. Don't touch.

266
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,299
How did you get in there?

267
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,375
There was an open window
in the back.

268
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,342
So you just decided to crawl in?

269
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,676
It's not like there was anybody else
in there. Saves me the price.

270
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,312
- You're just gonna sleep in there?
- Better than sleeping in here.

271
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:34,082
I can't get a good night's rest
listening to you two cuddle all night.

272
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,386
I'm gonna take a shower
before he gets us all kicked out.

273
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,062
You do that.

274
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,060
See? What'd I tell you?

275
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,206
She always getting pissed
about something.

276
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,170
I wonder why.

277
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,874
But that's how your life's
gonna be from now on.

278
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,275
God bless you.

279
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,509
Spending 10 hours a day selling rakes
in her old man's hardware store.

280
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,280
And don't forget, dinner with
the in-laws, huh? That'll be fun.

281
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:10,460
She'll get pissed because you don't
really like Mom's jerky and pinto beans.

282
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,961
Not exactly the dream life
we always talked about, dude.

283
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,192
But, you know, maybe you'll like
turning into Daniel Boone.

284
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,770
Yeah, or just keep hanging out
at Wrigley and getting drunk...

285
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,737
<i>...at North Side bars until we're 50.</i>

286
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,743
We're about to go in and that son
of a bitch started banging on the door.

287
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,643
He must have snuck in the back.

288
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,808
We gotta put up some exterior cameras
so this does not happen again.

289
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,318
What do you want to do
with this bunch?

290
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,659
We hold off.

291
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,892
It's just too risky with three.

292
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,564
Where's Smith at?

293
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,632
He's still out there.
He's keeping an eye on things.

294
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,071
<i>- Hey, come on.
- This shit is hard as hell.</i>

295
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,986
Hey. Hey!

296
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:25,091
Hey. Gordon says
we're a no-go for tonight.

297
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,770
Why?

298
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,964
In case you didn't notice, there's
three of them in there instead of two.

299
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,107
Hey! Hey!

300
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,581
Did you hear me?

301
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,483
Gordon says to call it off.

302
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:53,657
No, listen to me.
Gordon calls the shots around here.

303
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,993
I don't need anyone
to tell me how to do this.

304
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,167
Try to get a non-smoking room.

305
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,516
How are you, sir?

306
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,517
It's a long day of driving?

307
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,248
Very. My wife and I are looking for
a soft bed if you got one.

308
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,722
Afraid we don't. Not tonight.

309
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,687
We're doing a little maintenance
on the place. Sort of like a remodel.

310
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,491
Really?

311
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:35,704
You might wanna turn that off, then.
Save folks the trouble.

312
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,365
That's totally my fault.
I'll get to that soon enough.

313
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,205
You know,
there's the Alpine Motor Lodge...

314
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,177
...just down the road.
It's about a 20-minute drive.

315
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,279
Come on in, I'll call them for you.
See what they got open.

316
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,378
I'm just checking to see if you have any
rooms available tonight.

317
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,714
- Non-smoking.
- Oh, and no smoking if possible.

318
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,288
I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

319
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:35,428
Well, hopefully this other place
will take us in.

320
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,947
Oh, that sounds good.

321
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,590
Lucky I got something for you.

322
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,925
We should be up and ready
in a couple days...

323
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:14,730
...so if you need a place to stay
on your way back, come on by.

324
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,500
I'll give you our special room
for half off.

325
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,837
Why aren't we staying here?

326
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,275
I already found another place.

327
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,664
What in the hell were you two doing?

328
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,497
He wouldn't listen to me.
I told him you called it off.

329
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,864
He was gonna kill them.

330
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:52,668
When I say a plan has changed,
the plan has changed.

331
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,003
- What's the fucking difference?
- All...!

332
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,306
All it takes is for one to get away.

333
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,506
Now, no one's going anywhere.

334
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,310
But if you're getting
a little squeamish...

335
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,544
...just say so.

336
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,672
- Get out.
- That's all I can...

337
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,606
I'm kind of tired.

338
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,315
Well, I guess back to my free room.

339
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,383
Better hope nobody
walks in over there.

340
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,182
Not unless it's the
Squirrel Creek Community College...

341
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,882
...cheerleading bus showing up.

342
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,089
All right. Good night, Tanner.

343
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,094
I really don't like him,
you know that?

344
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,631
Why didn't you
say something earlier?

345
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,404
It's just one more day, okay?

346
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,098
Come on.

347
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,376
Are you sure you're tired?

348
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,625
Not funny.

349
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,328
- Jesus!
- What the hell you doing, man?

350
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,836
Normally I wouldn't stop
a good porno flick.

351
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,339
- Can you please get out?
- I'm the good guy, okay?

352
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,568
Listen to me, all right?

353
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,646
I'm not the only one
watching you two.

354
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,509
- What?
- What are you talking about?

355
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,446
Caleb, come here. Come here, man.

356
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,555
- Look at this.
- What is this?

357
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,692
I don't know, but it sure as hell
ain't pay-per-view.

358
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,088
Caleb, what are you doing?

359
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,899
He's watching us.

360
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,228
<i>What? Who's watching us?</i>

361
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,405
<i>- And that's that.
- Who's watching us?</i>

362
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,005
<i>The guy up in the office.</i>

363
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,334
<i>He's got cameras all over this room.</i>

364
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,738
<i>- Are you serious?
- Yes, he is, darling.</i>

365
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,005
If we're gonna do this,
you better get there before they bolt.

366
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,180
Let's do this fast.

367
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,352
- We go in and out, yeah?
- Hold on.

368
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,086
Look how scared she looks.

369
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,423
- I like watching them squirm.
- They'll take off.

370
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,855
No, we won't let them,
but Smith's right.

371
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,560
We shouldn't be
in such a hurry to finish.

372
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,997
Let's play with them for a while.

373
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,535
What the hell are you doing?

374
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,137
Wanna scare them?

375
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,038
Let's scare them.

376
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,411
<i>How do you know he's watching us?</i>

377
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,488
I saw your ass, but once I knew
it was yours, I stopped looking.

378
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,424
I turned it off almost immediately.

379
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,333
<i>I knew I'd find you two together.</i>

380
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:15,265
<i>If I hadn't, Elsa, I might have gone on
playing it your way.</i>

381
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,941
There's nothing on here.

382
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,508
It might be one of those perv joints
where you can check in...

383
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,680
...and watch the action
in the other room.

384
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,173
- I'm going over to kick that fucker's ass.
- No, the dude's watching us.

385
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,478
He knows we found the cameras.

386
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,020
You go there, the dude's
waiting with a shotgun...

387
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,055
...and some fucking K-Y Jelly.

388
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,987
We call the cops and wait for them.

389
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,685
Dude, the sheriff's probably
his cousin or something.

390
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,159
Call the cops, they show up,
we get corn-holed.

391
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,834
Fuck that idea, let's just go.

392
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,928
We're leaving, right?

393
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,339
- Assholes!
- Caleb, let's just go.

394
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,176
Dude, like always, your beautiful
fiancée's dead-on. Come on, dude.

395
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,282
Caleb, get in the car.

396
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,953
- Now!
- Come on, dude.

397
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,355
Shit.

398
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,798
I'm telling the cops
soon as we get back.

399
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,160
Whatever, man,
let's just get the hell out of here.

400
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,532
- What?
- You've got to be kidding me.

401
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,800
Fuck.

402
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,605
- You leave the light on or something?
- No.

403
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,249
Great. You gonna go ask
Norman Bates for a jump or should I?

404
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,822
I know I didn't leave
the lights on, okay?

405
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,653
What the fuck is that?

406
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,828
They're headlights. It's a truck.

407
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,429
- Shit. Come on, Tanner. Come with me.
- What are you doing?

408
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,836
- Fuck!
- Caleb, get back inside. Get back.

409
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,702
Go out the other side!
Go, go, go! Go!

410
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,709
Shit!

411
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,781
I'm calling the cops, man.

412
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,517
Oh, my God!

413
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,694
Damn! I can't get a signal!
Shit, this is not funny anymore.

414
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,127
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

415
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,166
Can you all scream
a little louder for me?

416
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,596
I'll fucking kill you!

417
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,102
I seriously doubt that, Caleb.

418
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,134
- Fuck!
- Where is he going?

419
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,901
Maybe to get a better view.

420
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,635
- A better fucking view of what?
- Where is he going?

421
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,109
Oh, shit!

422
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,679
- We have to get out.
- Where are we gonna go?

423
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,619
- Fuck!
- Hey!

424
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,557
Go, go!

425
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:04,567
Come on. Come on. Come here.

426
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,073
This has gone way past some porn
video. What the fuck is happening?

427
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,247
- They tried to kill us.
- They could have if they wanted to.

428
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,280
- They're just trying to scare us.
- No.

429
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,719
They're not just trying to scare us.
This is more than that.

430
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,288
They wouldn't go through that
if they planned on letting us walk.

431
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,925
Oh, my God. He said your name.

432
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,028
What? What?

433
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,627
You didn't say your name
when we checked in.

434
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,666
Oh, my God.

435
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,601
They can hear us.

436
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,176
All right, you guys.
You guys, come on. Come on.

437
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,847
Tanner, grab the door.

438
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,149
All right, so, what else did we say?

439
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,756
Who gives a shit? It's not like there's
gonna be a pop quiz at the end.

440
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,119
We told him that we were
coming from Chicago.

441
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:58,624
We're on our way to Beulah.

442
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,199
He knows we don't know anybody here,
or where to run for help.

443
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,198
Caleb, it doesn't matter where we run,
let's just run.

444
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,968
- I need to get to the trailer.
- Fuck that. Let's just go.

445
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,075
Jessica's right.
They're not gonna let us run out.

446
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,337
Yeah, but they're not gonna
just let us sit in here either.

447
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,505
We need something to fight with.

448
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,185
There's a bunch of stuff
in the back of the trailer.

449
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,387
There's kitchen stuff, knives, tools...

450
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:28,319
No, no, no. I like our chances
better if we just run.

451
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,528
How did you say
you got in here again?

452
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,527
There was an open window
in the bathroom.

453
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,364
But you told us that in our room.

454
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,931
They must have heard you.

455
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:50,069
Maybe not. It's worth a shot anyway.
Come on.

456
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,077
Let's go.

457
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,516
You guys stay.

458
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,299
All right, Tanner.
You go first, then Jess.

459
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,375
We don't know
what's out there, man.

460
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,207
We know what's gonna be in here
in a second. Now, let's go. Come on.

461
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,115
Careful.

462
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,669
Easy does it. Easy does it.

463
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,303
No!

464
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,001
Run, Jess!

465
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,573
No! Caleb!

466
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,006
Caleb! Caleb!

467
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,078
- We have to go back!
- You can't!

468
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,511
- They'll grab you too!
- No!

469
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:01,741
Come on. Come on.

470
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,314
- Hold him.
- No! Caleb!

471
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,183
- Tie him. Tie him.
- No!

472
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:08,481
Where'd they take him?

473
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:14,922
Caleb! Caleb!

474
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,793
- Caleb!
- What about them?

475
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,697
They won't run. Not yet anyway.

476
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,465
- Caleb! Caleb!
- Not while he's still alive.

477
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,471
Jess!

478
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:30,672
Caleb!

479
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,349
No! Caleb!

480
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,146
- How many do you see?
- I don't know. I think there's two. Caleb!

481
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,289
- What are they doing?
- Stay here.

482
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,014
Keep banging. Keep banging.

483
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,854
- Where are you going?
- They'll think we're both here.

484
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,119
Caleb!

485
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,833
No!

486
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,300
No!

487
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,801
No! They're killing him!

488
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,828
- Caleb! Caleb!
- Oh, my God.

489
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,557
No!

490
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,495
- They're out here.
- Come on! Come on!

491
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,172
Don't let them
make it out of the trees.

492
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,212
And make sure to get it on camera!

493
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,294
- No. I can't do this.
- No, they'll kill you. Come on.

494
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,627
We have to go back for him.
He would go back.

495
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:03,135
Listen. Listen to me.
We cannot go back, okay?

496
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,308
We just have to get to the cops.

497
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:06,974
You see anything?

498
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,542
Oh, shit. Come on.

499
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,019
What was that? I heard something.

500
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,930
Okay, let's go.

501
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,395
Shit.

502
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,900
Shit.

503
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,009
Reece!

504
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:46,080
- Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on.

505
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,478
Stop moving!

506
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,440
Tanner, Tanner, come on. Come on.
Are you okay? Come on.

507
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,335
Where'd they go?

508
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,843
Where did they go?

509
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,877
Oh, Jesus Christ.

510
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,485
I told you we should've waited.

511
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,520
The chase is half the fun.

512
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,752
We're gonna go this way.
You take the road.

513
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,725
No, no, no. I know these woods.

514
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,399
- Me and Reece...
- Take the road.

515
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,830
You, move. Let's go.

516
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,036
Come on!

517
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:27,913
What are you doing?

518
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,885
Maybe we should just hide
until daylight.

519
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,784
- See where we're going.
- No, I am not waiting here.

520
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,618
There'll be cars in the morning.
Somebody will help us.

521
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:40,456
I don't care. I'm not waiting here
while Caleb is there.

522
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,062
- Caleb is dead, okay?
- Fuck you!

523
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,961
You don't know that.

524
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,061
You don't know that.

525
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,869
Yes, I do know that.

526
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,102
And you know too.

527
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,076
I'm sorry.

528
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:09,086
Let's just keep going, okay?

529
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,394
Let's keep going. Let's go.

530
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,560
Let's keep going.

531
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,744
Over there. Over there.

532
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,798
- Somebody!
- Hello?

533
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,263
Hello? Please help us.

534
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,493
- Over here.
- Hello?

535
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,968
- Somebody?
- Please.

536
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,835
Hello?

537
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,134
Hey, Tanner! Tanner.

538
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,806
- We need your help.
- What do you think you're doing?

539
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,849
- Men were trying to kill us.
- What men?

540
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,112
One of them works at the motel.
Meadow View.

541
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,222
The Meadow View?
Why would they do that?

542
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,291
- We don't know why the fuck...
- You watch your mouth, son.

543
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:21,021
- You are disturbing a Christian home.
- Sorry, there's somebody out here...

544
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,859
No. No, no, listen.
No, listen, he's sorry, okay?

545
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,068
We need to use your phone
to call police.

546
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,567
Like we're gonna let strangers
into our house.

547
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,568
- How stupid do you think we are?
- Otis.

548
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,707
For all we know, this is an act
to get in here and rob us.

549
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,707
We don't give a fuck about
the shit in your house.

550
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,539
Be quiet, okay? Be quiet. Listen.

551
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:42,012
You could call them yourselves.
Please, just call the police. Okay?

552
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,150
All right, but you go on
and get off the porch.

553
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,323
Okay. Okay.

554
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,360
- Hillbilly.
- Don't say anything else, okay, please?

555
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,359
They could turn off
the damn spotlight.

556
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,998
Okay, just shut up. Come here.

557
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,406
- Shit.
- Oh, God.

558
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,208
You two. Hey, hey.

559
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,749
Why don't you wait inside
until the sheriff comes?

560
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,056
Doris, what the hell are you doing?

561
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,253
Jesus would let these two in here.

562
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:30,126
But he knows if they slit his throat,
he'd be back.

563
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:33,234
- Otis, that is blasphemy.
- And this here is crazy.

564
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,735
Oh, I don't know what you're
worried about. You're trifling.

565
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,932
Honey, why don't you come in the back
and have some coffee?

566
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:44,136
- No, it's okay.
- Nonsense. Come on.

567
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,854
Let's go, son. Come on.

568
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,118
How much longer do you think?

569
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:02,059
Don't know. We're a long ways out.

570
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,893
Time enough to tell me
what brought you two our way.

571
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,298
- We told you, the guys from the motel...
- I was asking her.

572
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,675
We were on our way to Beulah,
that's where I'm from.

573
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,610
Lot of good people in Beulah.
What's your family's name?

574
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,786
- Pruitt.
- Not Jack and Sarah Pruitt?

575
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,522
Sounds like the sheriff.

576
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,694
- What if it's not?
- Oh, I'm sure it is. Otis, go get him.

577
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:41,498
There's nothing to worry about, honey.
Not anymore.

578
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,614
Christ, what's taking them
so long, huh?

579
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:56,047
They're probably talking about
what happened, that's all. Otis.

580
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,946
Bring them back here, Otis.

581
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,213
There's been a change.
Gordon'll take them.

582
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:01,822
- No!
- That's fucking them!

583
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:06,291
- The guys we were telling you about!
- I appreciate you calling me, Otis.

584
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,121
These are the two who robbed us.

585
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,993
What? No, he's lying!
They're the ones that killed Caleb!

586
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,828
Hold on, now. Who's he?

587
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,335
- Christ, can we just do this?
- He just... He works for me, Doris.

588
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:20,134
Is that right? Why don't you tell me
what it is you say they stole?

589
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,470
What's it matter?
Gordon said they robbed him.

590
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,203
I take his word over strangers.

591
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:26,346
That fella there,
he's a stranger to me.

592
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,813
Call the sheriff. Call him, Otis.

593
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,645
Gordon.

594
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,719
You know what?
You guys held him for us.

595
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,820
That's more than enough. We'll take...

596
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:38,318
- We don't have time for this shit.
- Now, Otis.

597
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,461
No! Shit! No!

598
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:44,356
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Cleaning up my mess.

599
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,262
No!

600
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,901
Otis trusts me.

601
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:50,868
She would've called the sheriff.

602
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,668
- Let's run.
- Where do you think you're going?

603
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,037
He shot twice.
He doesn't have any shells.

604
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,212
Go! Go! Get them!

605
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,586
No!

606
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,589
No! No!

607
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,195
No!

608
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,590
No!

609
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,632
No! No!

610
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:47,957
Do it. Shit.

611
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,138
We need to find a phone.
Look for a phone, Jessica.

612
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,136
There's no phone!

613
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,843
There's a car, there's a car!

614
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,478
Go, go, go!

615
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:21,987
Jessica, come on!

616
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,833
Come on. Come on.
It's right over here. Come on.

617
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,938
No, no. Shit! Fuck!

618
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,272
Tanner, look out! No!

619
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,349
- I got them!
- No!

620
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,680
- I got them!
- Get off me!

621
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,223
Start filming.

622
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,501
Please!

623
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,101
They'll find those bodies...

624
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,636
...so let's make sure
they don't find anything of ours.

625
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,709
Go on. Go on. Make it look like
a fucked-up burglary. Go on!

626
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,607
Here. Give me that.

627
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,312
Move.

628
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,713
Move!

629
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,514
Go!

630
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:36,168
This moviemaking shit
is a lot harder than it looks.

631
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,400
Please.

632
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:47,947
I can't breathe.

633
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,806
What happened?

634
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,170
He murdered them both.

635
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,371
What are we gonna do, Gordon?

636
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,610
Go!

637
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,931
- Haul his ass to the truck.
- No.

638
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,071
I'll take care of her. Come on.

639
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,940
No, no, no!

640
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,954
No!

641
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:40,528
<i>No! No!</i>

642
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,029
<i>- No!
- Well, time to go back to work.</i>

643
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,532
Are you sitting this one out too?

644
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:57,075
You've done the rest on your own.
Might as well make it a clean sweep.

645
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,212
Well, it makes me wonder
what I need you two for.

646
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,648
Let's have some fun.

647
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,588
I don't like this anymore, Gordon.

648
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,197
What are we gonna do?

649
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,836
<i>No!</i>

650
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:27,035
No!

651
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,505
No!

652
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,558
We'll just let it play out.

653
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,861
I mean, he's the only one
who's killed anyone tonight.

654
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,591
We'll wait till the time's right
and we'll pin the whole thing on him.

655
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,600
- What are you two talking about?
- Nothing.

656
01:02:56,739 --> 01:03:00,607
Not that either of you
have got the balls to use it.

657
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,739
If you start getting a brave feeling...

658
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,348
...I'd be real careful.

659
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,131
You enjoy your nap?

660
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:31,567
Why, you looked like
a little angel sleeping there.

661
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:38,007
I'm gonna try something
a little different this time.

662
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:49,023
Unless you can
convince me different.

663
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,297
Wait, wait, wait.

664
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,946
You remind me of a girl
I picked up in Tulsa.

665
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,820
Or Little Rock. I can't remember.

666
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,687
Wish I got to know her better.

667
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,034
She had the damnedest scream.

668
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,039
Almost made my ears bleed.

669
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,675
I wonder what you sound like.

670
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,460
Get over there!

671
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,224
You bitch!

672
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,901
- Shit!
- Get in here, you fucking bitch!

673
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,726
Fuck!

674
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,691
Fuck!

675
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:38,066
Fuck. Fuck.

676
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,734
Get her! Get the fucking gun!

677
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,697
- Maybe we should...
- Go get her!

678
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,760
Where is she?

679
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,832
Find her.

680
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,970
Find her!

681
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:24,606
Caleb.

682
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:29,504
Caleb.

683
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,412
Caleb.

684
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:08,783
You have to be quiet.

685
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,086
Jessica.

686
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:23,759
Just keep looking up here, okay?

687
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,472
Tanner.

688
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,142
Tanner.

689
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,073
Shit.

690
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,003
Shit.

691
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,117
Reece!

692
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:06,132
Stupid asshole.

693
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,497
Reece!

694
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,444
Hello, angel.

695
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,267
No!

696
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:49,964
No!

697
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:53,272
No! No!

698
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,924
Shit!

699
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:17,054
Back off! No!

700
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,132
No! No!

701
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,087
Shit!

702
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,443
Please. Stop.

703
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,379
Please stop!

704
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,590
Sheriff, somebody tore the shit
out of this place.

705
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:59,096
- Well, she said there were cameras.
- They're not here anymore.

706
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:02,497
Yeah, no bodies either.
You get ahold of the owner?

707
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:04,700
Yeah. Lives in Florida.

708
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:08,171
Says Gordon Jenks
runs the business for him.

709
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:12,335
I know Gordon.
Seems decent enough.

710
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:16,210
Not if you buy the girl's story. Do you?

711
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,046
All I'm buying
is some folks are dead.

712
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:24,386
Sure would make it easier if we could
find out what happened to her friends.

713
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:42,074
So how many do you want?

714
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,972
As many as you can make me.

715
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,647
I'll start burning some copies.

716
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,784
How long before
you can have a new one?

717
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,578
A few weeks.

718
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:56,552
Just as soon
as I get the place fixed up...

719
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,919
...put the cameras in...

720
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,996
...we'll be open for business.

721
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,960
All right.
