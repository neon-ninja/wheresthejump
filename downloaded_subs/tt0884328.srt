1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,603
(thunder crashes)

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,507
(swing music playing)

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,169
(rain falling)

4
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,702
(music ceases)

5
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,018
BILLY: Whoa!

6
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,196
STEPHANIE:
All the food's gonna go bad.

7
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,135
Yeah, I drew up a list.

8
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,473
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

9
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,203
Fuck.

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,749
- Can you save it?
- No. No way.

11
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,411
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

12
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,751
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

13
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,414
see if they can extend my deadline.

14
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,319
STEPHANIE:
What choice do they have?

15
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,918
(David sighs heavily)

16
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:10,985
You kiddin'?

17
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,897
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

18
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,231
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,202
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

20
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,932
Just stupid, I guess.

21
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,997
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

22
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,009
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

23
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,510
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

24
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,136
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

25
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,374
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

26
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,041
Order in some new glass.

27
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,850
Oh, you know what?
That was your--

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,480
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

29
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,286
- Ohh.
- Used to play in that tree.

30
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,519
It's just stuff, though.

31
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,118
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

32
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,356
Yeah.

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,920
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,728
Hey, Billy, take it easy,
all right?

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,529
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

36
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,694
But you gotta come look.

37
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,762
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,000
Billy.

39
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,134
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

40
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,576
Whoa!

41
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,077
Whoa.

42
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,081
- Whoa.
- Come on.

43
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,083
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

44
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,745
- BILLY: Come on!
- (Stephanie chuckles)

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,811
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

46
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,553
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,652
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

48
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,718
No.

49
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,728
- Norton's tree.
- (sighs) Yeah.

50
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,273
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

51
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,502
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

52
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,566
That tree?

53
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,805
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kiddin'.

54
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,878
Look at that.

55
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,313
What is it, Daddy?

56
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,312
Mist.

57
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,759
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

58
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,762
Coming off the mountain like that?

59
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,321
Two fronts meeting,

60
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,629
left over from the storm,
something like that.

61
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,192
You sure?

62
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,703
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

63
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,932
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

64
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,338
I'll take him to town with me.

65
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,807
Okay. Where you going?

66
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,970
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

67
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,138
Hon.

68
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,205
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

69
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,614
You know what he's gonna say.

70
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,710
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

71
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,585
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy

72
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,090
is enough to last me a lifetime.

73
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,820
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

74
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,883
Okay.

75
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,953
- That's all.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,795
(Norton grunting,
pulling chainsaw chain)

77
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,495
NORTON: Ohh!
Mother fucker!

78
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,140
Aw, shit!

79
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,676
Ohh, you mother fucker!

80
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,001
Cock sucker!

81
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,170
"Turn on.

82
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,444
"Full choke.

83
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,679
Pull five... choke."

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,615
I guess you've seen the--

85
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,183
boathouse.

86
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,593
Yeah, and--?

87
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,291
Nothin'.

88
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,698
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?.

89
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,758
That's all.

90
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,396
(scoffs)

91
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,963
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me.

92
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,176
Oh.

93
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,237
Shit. The 1980.

94
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,180
NORTON: I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

95
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,482
I don't know, the weather was
so beautiful coming out of New York,

96
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,783
I just--
You know, top down.

97
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,584
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

98
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,147
Sincerely.

99
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,523
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

100
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,223
I hate to see it like that.

101
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,658
Okay, I'll tell you what,

102
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,534
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

103
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,163
- That okay?
- No problem.

104
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,502
So, uh, David--

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,683
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

106
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,295
DAVID:
Well, CMP's out in force.

107
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,797
Maybe we'll get our power back.

108
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,897
NORTON:
I know. Some storm, huh?

109
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,271
One for the books, yeah.

110
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,003
For a moment there last night,

111
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,511
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

112
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,639
WZON is off the air,

113
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,945
but Portland's still broadcasting.

114
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,006
Daddy, look.

115
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,917
Ah.

116
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,852
Guys from the base.

117
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,480
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

118
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,149
The Arrowhead Project?

119
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,983
Well, you're a local.

120
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,825
Any idea what they do up there?

121
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,387
Missile defense research.

122
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,296
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

123
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,356
Oh, sure.

124
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,835
The woman at the Laundromat
says that, uh,

125
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,998
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

126
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,837
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

127
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,503
Miss Tabloid.
(chuckles)

128
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,240
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

129
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,076
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

130
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,483
You know, real reliable stuff.

131
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,714
DAVID: Well, they're in a hurry.

132
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,454
Maybe their power's out too.

133
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,692
Huh. Still no signal.

134
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,968
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

135
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,736
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

136
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,608
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

137
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,668
- BILLY: Yeah.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,339
Here's a list.

139
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,746
- Sure.
- Okay?

140
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,011
Meet you guys in there.

141
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,075
Hold hands.

142
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,189
MAN: I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was your sister.

143
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,592
(pulsing tone)

144
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,597
(clicks phone cradle;
pulsing tone continues)

145
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,724
BOY: That looks so freaky!

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,789
Hmm.

147
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,597
(chatter)

148
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,234
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

149
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,869
You guys look jammed up.

150
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,074
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

151
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,481
Oh, no. What,
no backup generator?

152
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,041
Only to keep the food cold.

153
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,677
Everything else,
welcome to the Dark Ages,

154
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,846
and bring your checkbook.

155
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,413
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

156
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,926
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

157
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,554
Oh, my God.

158
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,120
OLLIE: (humorless chuckle)
The storm.

159
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,292
Everybody's stockin' up.
Been like this since we opened.

160
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,528
Crappy day, huh?

161
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,094
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

162
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,003
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

163
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,735
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

164
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,041
but I guess we'll have to make do.

165
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,506
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,309
Hey, champ.

167
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,820
Your wife should be a doctor.

168
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,052
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

169
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,924
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

170
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,157
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

171
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,220
Okay, done.

172
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,130
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

173
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,933
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

174
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,535
Oh, I don't know.

175
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,938
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

176
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,316
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

177
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,375
I guess not.

178
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,783
And that's a start, huh?

179
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,815
BUD: I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

180
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,884
The power outage got us too.

181
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,624
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

182
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,327
(indistinct conversation)

183
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,393
(chuckles)

184
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,170
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

185
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,235
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

186
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,648
(customers chattering)

187
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,585
BUD: I need some change
on register five.

188
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,246
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

189
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,586
BILLY: Hello, Ms. Reppler.

190
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,821
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.

191
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,556
How'd you hold up in the storm?

192
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,791
We had a tree come through
the picture window last night,

193
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,025
right in my studio.

194
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,069
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

195
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,125
IRENE: Ouch.

196
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,695
- Yeah.
- IRENE: Sorry to hear that.

197
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,941
DAVID:
How'd you guys make out?

198
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,174
HATTIE: Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

199
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,080
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

200
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,812
IRENE: We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?.

201
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,878
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

202
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,483
but with funds being cut every year...

203
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,027
You'd think educating children

204
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,290
would be more
of a priority in this country,

205
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,457
but you'd be wrong.

206
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,660
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

207
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,399
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

208
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,465
(passing sirens wail)

209
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,679
(fire truck horn blares)

210
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,544
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

211
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,419
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

212
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,982
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

213
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,588
SOLDIER: Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

214
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,687
Check our papers.

215
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,755
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

216
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,821
I don't know why.

217
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,891
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

218
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,437
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

219
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,494
That's an order.

220
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,500
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

221
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,117
(Klaxon blares)

222
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,322
(Klaxon continues)

223
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,304
Oh, my God!

224
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,986
Something in the mist!

225
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,921
- (excited shouting)
- Something in the mist...

226
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,481
...took John Lee!

227
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,891
Dan, catch your breath.

228
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,826
Something in the mist took John Lee.

229
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,659
I could hear him screaming.

230
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,667
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

231
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,396
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

232
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,461
(Klaxon blares)

233
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,896
DAN: Don't go out there.

234
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,205
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

235
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,768
MAN: Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car.

236
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,337
Mister, no!

237
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,440
(police siren wails)

238
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,179
(police siren ceases)

239
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,622
(keys jangling)

240
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,165
(man screaming)

241
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,104
Please hold me.

242
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,173
- (Billy whimpers)
- It's okay, it's okay.

243
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,381
CORNELL: It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

244
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,549
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

245
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,416
MAN: (whispering)
What is it?

246
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,152
What's going on?

247
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,493
It's death.

248
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,558
Aah!

249
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,537
(crashing and rumbling)

250
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,596
(screaming and shouting)

251
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,484
(screaming)

252
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,320
(building girders groaning)

253
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,703
- (screaming and shouting)
- MAN: Stay down!

254
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,066
BILLY: Daddy!

255
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,234
(rumbling stops)

256
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,073
(woman coughing)

257
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,736
(woman weeping)

258
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,043
MAN: (faintly)
You okay?

259
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,516
(coughing)

260
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,750
That was an earthquake.

261
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,060
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

262
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,589
OLLIE: Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

263
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,967
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

264
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,905
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

265
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,069
MRS. CARMODY: No.
No, don't go out there.

266
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,942
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

267
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,039
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

268
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,949
NORTON: Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

269
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,010
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

270
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,487
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

271
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,925
I'm sorry, I-- I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

272
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,894
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

273
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,657
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

274
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,221
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

275
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,961
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

276
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,400
WOMAN: You're not listening!

277
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,665
I can't stay here.

278
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,640
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only 8.

279
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,578
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

280
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,913
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

281
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,419
She's only 8.

282
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,925
For their sakes,

283
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,324
don't.

284
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,024
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

285
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,503
DAVID: (softly)
Shh. It's okay, pal.

286
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,199
Won't somebody here
see a lady home?

287
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,376
You?

288
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,048
You?

289
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,796
- DAVID: (softly) It's okay, buddy.
- You?

290
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,169
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

291
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,810
I hope you all rot in hell.

292
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,075
OLLIE:
Ma'am, please, wait until--

293
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,837
(soft weeping)

294
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,744
BUD: Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

295
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,482
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

296
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,218
Aisle three has medical supplies.

297
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,125
- (Billy crying)
- It's okay. It's okay.

298
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,890
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

299
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,953
Come on.

300
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,694
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

301
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,429
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

302
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,834
Come on!

303
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,895
Come on,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

304
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,305
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

305
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,865
All right, I know you want Mommy.

306
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,411
(very softly)
All right, just try to breathe.

307
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,810
Just try to breathe, okay?

308
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,246
(Billy crying)

309
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,146
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

310
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,878
- (Billy crying)
- It's all right.

311
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,582
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old.

312
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,455
AMANDA: He's in shock.

313
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,256
I think we all are.

314
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,693
IRENE: You haven't met.

315
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,597
Amanda Dunfrey.

316
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,826
She's new in town
as of this semester.

317
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,325
Teaches third grade

318
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,668
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

319
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,674
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

320
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,837
And David's an artist.

321
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,881
He does movie posters and such.

322
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,937
And me...

323
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:09,419
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

324
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,978
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

325
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,284
Boy settle down?

326
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,847
How is he?

327
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,984
Still hot.

328
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,550
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

329
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,493
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

330
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,088
Thanks.

331
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,655
DAVID: How's Dan?

332
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,564
His nose stopped bleedin'.

333
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,967
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

334
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,129
Can't believe the way he ran in here.

335
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,302
Never seen him like that.

336
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,675
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

337
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,608
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

338
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,743
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

339
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,912
You bet. Sally, you mind?

340
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,320
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

341
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,790
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

342
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,849
Daddy, don't go.

343
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,090
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

344
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,064
Mrs. Reppler's here,

345
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,124
and so is Mrs. Turman.

346
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,659
I'll be close by, okay?

347
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,331
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

348
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,396
Let me look at you.

349
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,267
Hmm?

350
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,139
HATTIE: Wanna lie down?

351
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,204
Yeah.

352
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,546
There you go.

353
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,282
NORTON: Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe and free,

354
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,789
but we have to be smart about it.

355
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,519
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

356
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,151
and find out what's happened.

357
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,718
MAN: Well, Howe gonna
do that, my man?

358
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,390
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

359
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,026
NORTON: I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

360
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,332
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

361
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,393
would be their top priority.

362
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,463
(machinery hums)

363
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,642
(David coughs)

364
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,344
(coughing)
Jeez!

365
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,893
(coughs)

366
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,034
Oh, shit.

367
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,032
- (sharp crack)
- Ow!

368
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,002
Shit!

369
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,346
(grunts)

370
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,512
God damn it!

371
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,578
Ow! Ow!

372
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,782
Bitch!

373
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,018
NORTON: It's obvious that we're--

374
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,084
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

375
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,790
MAN: Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

376
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,196
CORNELL: There ain't nothin'
natural about it either.

377
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,256
MAN: That's right.

378
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,997
MRS. CARMODY: It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

379
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,562
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

380
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,130
MAN: Ohh, fuck, now.

381
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,869
MRS. CARMODY:
You've done that to yourself,

382
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,843
by a life of sin and dissolution.

383
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,889
(metal rumbling and creaking)

384
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,817
(rumbling and creaking cease)

385
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,160
(metal rumbling and creaking)

386
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,334
(creaking loudly)

387
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,852
Hey, whoa! David!

388
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,292
DAVID: Hey, you guys hear that?

389
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,262
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

390
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,196
No, no, I turned the generator off.

391
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,257
It-- it was backing up.

392
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,270
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

393
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,970
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

394
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,807
back there in the dark.

395
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,370
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

396
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,975
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

397
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,917
No, only after.

398
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,251
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

399
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,382
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

400
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,120
JIM: No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be thattaway, Mr. Drayton.

401
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,253
You had a scare, no doubt.

402
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,991
What say we all go check it out?

403
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,498
Here.

404
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,436
JIM: Oooopf!
(chuckles)

405
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,496
Man.

406
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,668
It's pretty rank in here.

407
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,871
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

408
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,113
Go on, fire it up.

409
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,948
(generator whirrs to life)

410
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,124
JIM: (laughing)
All right!

411
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,287
Shut it off!

412
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,093
Holy crow, don't that stink!

413
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,432
MYRON: Something's
got the exhaust vent

414
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,128
plugged up from the outside.

415
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,637
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

416
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,195
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

417
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,433
No, no, you can't do that.

418
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,499
MYRON: Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

419
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,569
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

420
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,977
MYRON: Okay, I'll do it.

421
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,948
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

422
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,007
What, don't you think I can do it?

423
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,713
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

424
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,278
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

425
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,948
- J-Jim, right?
- JIM: Mm-hmm.

426
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,515
Myron? You guys are--

427
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,688
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

428
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,321
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

429
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,059
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

430
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,296
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

431
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,529
NORM: Like what?

432
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,738
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

433
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,297
Are you guys being willfully dense?

434
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,707
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

435
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,441
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

436
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,346
I mean, we're not
hearing anything now, right?

437
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,406
Anybody?

438
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,741
See?

439
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,014
(Jim chuckles)

440
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,114
Now, I know, I know--
you're a big shot artist

441
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,682
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

442
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,058
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

443
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,494
Hey, I didn't say that.

444
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,896
Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid

445
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,935
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

446
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,164
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

447
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,603
The food'll keep without it.

448
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,403
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,

449
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,103
and you yell out
when you got enough room.

450
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,702
Yeah. Okay, good.

451
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,542
DAVID: Wait.

452
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,603
This is--

453
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,582
You guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

454
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,380
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

455
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,886
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

456
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,943
OLLIE: Norm!

457
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,013
JIM: Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

458
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,081
The next time
you got somethin' to say,

459
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,524
you count your teeth,

460
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,927
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit.

461
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,487
All right?

462
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,555
Come on, Myron.

463
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,294
- DAVID: This is crazy!
- OLLIE: Leave 'em be.

464
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,336
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

465
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,895
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

466
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,304
What's going on here?

467
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,137
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

468
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,201
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

469
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,303
so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

470
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,870
- MYRON: Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

471
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,314
Norm, come on.

472
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,372
Don't, man.

473
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,684
(generator whirrs to life)

474
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,915
DAVID: It's a mistake.

475
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,689
Pussy.

476
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,293
Go up!

477
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,616
So...

478
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,181
any boogeymen?

479
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,750
(Jim laughs)

480
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,586
JIM: Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

481
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,723
Yeah, right.

482
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
(laughter)

483
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,958
MYRON: Norm.

484
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,730
Norm!

485
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,103
What the fuck!

486
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,732
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off!

487
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,709
Get this friggin' thing off me!

488
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,507
Get it off! Help me!

489
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,375
Help me! Help me!

490
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,915
Aah! Aaahhh!

491
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,382
Jesus!

492
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,115
(Norm shouting)

493
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:06,619
There's more! There's more!

494
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,631
Somebody help me.

495
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,159
Somebody help me.

496
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,898
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

497
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,940
(Norm crying and shouting)

498
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,678
Aaahhhh!

499
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,683
Hang on!

500
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,417
Aaahhhh!

501
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,592
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

502
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,425
Aaahhhh!

503
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,565
Oh, Jesus!

504
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,178
(Norm grunting and straining)

505
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,782
(monster sniffing)

506
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,255
MYRON: Aah!

507
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,758
Aah!

508
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,636
JIM: Shit! Oh, shit!

509
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,803
Oh, shit!

510
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,742
OLLIE: David, it's no good!

511
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,805
Aah!

512
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,374
DAVID: Start the generator.

513
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,012
Aah! Aaaggghhh!

514
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,722
Gaaahhhh!

515
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,566
(Norm screams)

516
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,123
(monster shrieks)

517
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,918
Hey, I'm sorry.

518
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,086
I mean, how the--

519
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,185
how the hell was I supposed
to know what you meant?

520
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,224
You said you heard something.

521
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,057
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

522
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,329
You should've said
what you meant better.

523
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,895
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or something.

524
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,339
You got that kid killed!

525
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,377
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

526
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,607
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

527
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,875
- Huh?
- David!

528
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,280
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

529
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,183
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

530
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,244
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

531
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,750
(groaning)

532
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,065
(David panting)

533
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,136
Okay, I'm done.

534
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,235
Okay.

535
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,806
What's next?

536
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,343
Kill the generator.

537
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,014
That's the first thing.

538
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,291
JIM: I'm sorry.

539
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,092
DAVID:
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

540
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,728
JIM: I'm-- I'm sorry about the kid.

541
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,967
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

542
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,740
We oughta get out of here.

543
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,143
(coughing and retching)

544
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,412
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

545
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,782
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

546
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,687
What's your excuse, huh?

547
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,223
Get outta here.

548
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,126
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

549
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,433
Don't say anything, to anybody.

550
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,027
Not yet.

551
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,595
Not yet.

552
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,537
(generator whirrs)

553
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,606
(generator stops)

554
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,643
OLLIE: (softly)
Shit.

555
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,953
David? Need a little light here.

556
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,566
We have to tell 'em.

557
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:16,470
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

558
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,106
They won't believe us.

559
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,400
They have to.

560
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,743
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was here.

561
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,875
W-what we saw was impossible.

562
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,885
You know that, don't you?

563
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:29,942
I mean, what--

564
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,953
what do we say?

565
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,620
How do we convince them?

566
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,623
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

567
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,806
Oh, my God!
Are-- are you all right?

568
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,367
DAVID: Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

569
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,776
W-what the hell happened?

570
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,644
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?

571
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,706
I need to deal with something first.

572
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,211
Please, I've got to--

573
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,018
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

574
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,957
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

575
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,016
Okay.

576
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,702
JIM: Hey, look,
I'm sorry about Norm.

577
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,135
Me too.

578
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,604
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

579
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,971
Look, we need to tell people.

580
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,533
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

581
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,376
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here.

582
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,914
People need to know.

583
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,540
MYRON:
What about the out-of-towners?

584
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,381
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

585
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,683
- OLLIE: Brent Norton?
- JIM: That windbag?

586
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,485
He's an important attorney
in New York.

587
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,719
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

588
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,285
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or-- or anywhere.

589
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,887
- MYRON: Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

590
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,900
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

591
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,731
W-wait. What do you mean
getting in?

592
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,827
You shut the loading door.

593
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,466
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

594
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,303
Jesus Christ.

595
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,689
NORTON: I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

596
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,250
DAVID: Um, listen...

597
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,092
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

598
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,826
(conversation continues indistinctly)

599
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:29,096
...they're-- they're--
We saw tentacles.

600
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,606
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

601
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:33,166
Unh-unh.

602
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,735
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got--

603
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,142
Come here.

604
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,207
Tell him.

605
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,276
It's true.

606
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,529
Tentacles. Yeah.

607
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,197
Um, gentlemen, um...

608
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,004
I'm sorry, I--
I'm just not that stupid.

609
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,478
I mean, what do you take me for?

610
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,242
I'm shocked.

611
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,305
I'm shocked.

612
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,511
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless

613
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,577
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot.

614
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,316
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

615
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,358
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

616
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,415
I'll show you.

617
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,088
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on-- on the floor.

618
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,153
No.

619
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,926
No? What do you mean no?

620
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,161
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

621
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,398
and this pathetic attempt at a joke

622
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,406
has gone far enough.

623
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,466
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have--?

624
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,170
Oh, please! Please!

625
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,736
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

626
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,646
and you guys are backing him up.

627
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,377
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

628
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,647
You wanted to humiliate me
some more,

629
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,052
show me a rubber snake
while these-- these hicks

630
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,454
stand around laughing their asses off.

631
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,786
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

632
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,724
- Hey, hey, fuck--!
- JIM: Mr. Norton...

633
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,388
... I swear, you have
got us all wrong.

634
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,958
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

635
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,061
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

636
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:11,006
and I have seen you
talking behind my back.

637
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,843
Y'all stick together.

638
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,842
Well, don't I feel foolish?

639
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,407
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

640
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,976
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

641
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,215
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

642
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,689
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

643
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,350
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

644
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,987
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

645
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,122
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David--

646
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,530
Okay, my son's life.
Now, I need you.

647
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,162
Brent, please,
get your head out of your ass.

648
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,297
All right, I'll drag you
back there if I have to.

649
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,362
Come here.

650
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,433
David, get your goddamn hands
off of me!

651
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,445
I'll sue your ass again!

652
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,777
Sue your ass, and this time
you'll go to jail!

653
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,338
This man assaulted me.

654
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,044
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

655
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,108
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

656
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,814
No.

657
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,289
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

658
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,417
(scoffs)

659
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,623
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

660
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,326
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

661
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,698
Okay.

662
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,761
BUD: W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

663
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,329
You're drinking?

664
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,897
For Christ's sake, Ollie.

665
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,004
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

666
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,979
Look, I'm gonna be taking down
names, starting with you.

667
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,016
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

668
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,074
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

669
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,985
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen.

670
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,018
This is Mr. David Drayton.

671
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,424
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

672
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,156
DAVID:...go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

673
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,561
Listen, don't be scared.

674
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,722
It's okay.

675
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,926
Okay.

676
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,436
This is how it is.

677
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,940
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

678
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,174
but there are things in it, and they're
dangerous, like Dan said.

679
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,235
That's right.

680
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,645
That's exactly right.

681
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,581
MAN: What kind of things?

682
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,641
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

683
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,517
I got knocked down.

684
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,751
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

685
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,419
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

686
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,155
me...

687
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,720
Norm, the bag boy.

688
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,288
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

689
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:19,097
...so Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

690
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,031
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

691
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,095
Took him?

692
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,766
What do you mean?

693
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,504
Just... killed him.

694
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,443
I mean dragged him off.

695
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:34,075
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

696
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,642
All we saw were tentacles.

697
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,589
(onlookers muttering)

698
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,580
WOMAN: Tentacles?

699
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,354
NORTON: Tentacles, he says.

700
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,024
Tentacles from Planet X.

701
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,431
It's a lie, you know.

702
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,629
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

703
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,932
It's a pile of shit.

704
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,496
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie.

705
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:57,562
It's lunacy.

706
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,136
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

707
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,907
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it.

708
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,969
Go look.

709
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,710
DAVID: (softly)
Over there.

710
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,885
What the hell is that?

711
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,398
(sizzling sound)

712
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,695
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

713
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,371
Yeah, just keep 'em in line.
Thanks.

714
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,055
Let me...

715
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,598
help these people.

716
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,499
Let me--

717
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,561
let me preach your word.

718
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,008
Let me shine your light,

719
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,567
'cause they're not all bad.

720
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,911
They can't all be bad.

721
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,854
Some can be saved, can't they?

722
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,685
Yes.

723
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,248
Some can be brought...

724
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,525
to heaven's holy gates
through your grace.

725
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,825
I have to believe that,

726
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,301
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

727
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,600
If I can save a few...

728
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,933
even one...

729
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,436
then my life will have counted
for something.

730
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,282
I will have pulled my weight.

731
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,719
I will have earned my place
at your side.

732
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:29,123
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

733
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,683
Hello?

734
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,798
(Mrs. Carmody sniffles softly)

735
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,073
What?

736
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,375
I just need to use the bathroom.

737
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,437
Oh.

738
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,050
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

739
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,584
Ma'am...

740
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,528
I-- I just want you to know
that it's okay--

741
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,258
being scared, I mean--

742
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,891
and, well, if you need a friend--

743
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,401
you know, someone to talk to.

744
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,461
I have a friend--

745
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:18,439
God up above.
I talk to him every day.

746
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,500
Don't you condescend to me.

747
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:21,703
I'm sorry?

748
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,306
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

749
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,009
That's not what I was doing.

750
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,009
Well, I'll tell you what--

751
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,918
the day I need a friend like you,

752
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,049
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

753
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,559
Maybe you do believe this.

754
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:45,726
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

755
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,034
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

756
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,131
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

757
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,131
You're not arguing a case,

758
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,768
and you're doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are.

759
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,837
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

760
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,348
You still haven't fooled anyone.

761
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,474
OLLIE: Leave it alone, David.

762
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,245
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

763
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,310
even when their hair is burning.

764
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,878
Denial is a powerful thing.

765
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,945
Well, keep talking.

766
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,357
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

767
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,123
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

768
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,132
There's no defense
against the will of God.

769
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,395
There's no court of appeals in hell.

770
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,869
There's no defense here, either.

771
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,168
Not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,

772
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,731
not even if you stack it
as high as you can.

773
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,334
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

774
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,403
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

775
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,508
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

776
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,247
Those who want to stack dog food,

777
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,879
knock yourselves out.

778
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,957
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

779
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,189
It should help.

780
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,594
Yeah, think so?

781
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,463
Duct tape and dog food bags.

782
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,002
That bad?

783
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,061
It's not good.

784
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,303
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

785
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,170
Open your eyes.

786
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,510
Let the scales fall away.

787
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,573
This has all been written.

788
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,418
Revelations, chapter 15:

789
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,820
"And the temple was filled with smoke

790
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,052
"from the glory of God

791
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,525
"and from his power,

792
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,086
"and no one could enter the temple

793
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:23,156
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

794
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,531
Well, what are you saying?

795
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,935
What are you proposing?

796
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,596
That we all prepare...

797
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,506
to meet our Maker.

798
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,735
JIM: Oh, prepare to meet shit!

799
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,303
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

800
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,281
so that it can waggle at both ends.

801
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,113
MRS. CARMODY:
The end time has come,

802
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,948
not in flames, but in mist.

803
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,009
JIM: Come here!

804
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,214
MYRON: Easy! Back off!

805
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,315
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

806
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,381
How about that?

807
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,950
Hey, there's no call for that.

808
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,588
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

809
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,428
MRS. CARMODY: I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

810
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,695
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

811
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,827
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

812
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,497
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away.

813
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,440
Things in the mist--
do you doubt?

814
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,499
Do you?

815
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,013
Then go out.

816
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,447
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

817
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,506
Shut up, lady.

818
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,447
For God's sakes.

819
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,682
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

820
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,156
They should be scared.

821
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,921
Oh, yes, they should.

822
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,453
Their beautiful, pure little minds

823
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,022
have been corrupted with lies.

824
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,089
Lies.

825
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,261
All this talk of a modern God,

826
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,033
or no God.

827
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,767
There is one God.

828
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,502
The God of the Israelites.

829
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:42,408
And he is a stern and vengeful God,

830
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,039
and we have been mocking him
far too long,

831
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,778
and now he demands
retribution in blood.

832
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,514
It is time to declare yourselves.

833
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:53,248
Take sides--

834
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,154
the saved and the damned.

835
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,717
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

836
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,627
- Blood!
- What?

837
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,687
Blood.

838
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,561
Little Normie was first,

839
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:07,696
and now God calls the rest of us.

840
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,261
The bill is due.

841
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,829
It must be paid.

842
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,900
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

843
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,467
to prove his love for God, so--

844
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,741
- Enough.
- (onlookers gasp)

845
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,354
- Ohh.
- Another down payment.

846
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,889
A few more pennies in the jar.

847
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,983
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

848
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,391
I-I'm sorry everybody,

849
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,454
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

850
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,021
MRS. CARMODY:
They'll come for you.

851
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,558
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

852
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,006
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

853
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,065
See if they don't.

854
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,872
And when they do,

855
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,573
you will cry to God,

856
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:54,311
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

857
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,715
OLLIE: That's fine.

858
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,051
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

859
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,114
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

860
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,523
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

861
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,085
And you, bitch...

862
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,053
you hit me again...

863
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,226
if you dare.

864
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,897
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

865
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,442
Those of you who aren't local
should know

866
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,346
that Mrs. Carmody
is known in town for being...

867
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,405
unstable.

868
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,885
No shit.
What was your first clue?

869
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,447
SOLDIER: Shh.

870
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,324
Hi.

871
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,555
What's up, little dude?

872
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,428
How come your friends
don't come get us?

873
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:42,988
They got tanks and stuff, right?

874
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,833
Why can't you just call 'em?

875
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,063
Phones don't work.

876
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,900
But don't you got, like, a radio?

877
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,462
Hey, champ, what's going on?

878
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,668
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

879
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,734
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

880
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,801
But--

881
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,744
Shh. Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

882
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,804
SOLDIER: Yeah, sure thing.

883
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,315
SOLDIER #2:
Troop, off your asses.

884
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,444
- DAVID: You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

885
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,852
Oh, man, I don't either.

886
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,390
But you know what?

887
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,189
Maybe she's scared too.

888
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,184
You think?

889
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,720
You think Mommy's okay?

890
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,064
(sighs)
Billy...

891
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,099
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

892
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,162
Aw, hey.

893
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,336
Mommy loves you very much.

894
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,902
And I'll bet she's fine.

895
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,739
And I promise you,

896
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

897
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:39,953
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

898
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,457
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

899
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,293
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops

900
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,694
to make torches.

901
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,629
And we've got knives and stuff,
God knows.

902
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,100
This may be
a silly question, Bud, but...

903
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,934
do you happen to have
a gun in the store?

904
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,770
Here? No. Please.

905
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,570
This-- this isn't Los Angeles.

906
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:01,303
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

907
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,137
I could try for it if you want.

908
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,478
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

909
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,539
Hold on.

910
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,520
This gun, um...

911
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,487
my husband's idea.

912
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,548
He's away on business a lot.

913
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,786
It's not even loaded.

914
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,487
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

915
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:19,550
AMANDA: Um...

916
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,666
DAVID:
You know how to use that?

917
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,327
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.

918
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,893
Hit the target a few times.

919
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,500
So, we got a gun.

920
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,509
Anybody know how to shoot it?

921
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:34,941
Well, I mean?

922
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,001
I do.

923
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:39,771
You?

924
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,683
(scoffs)
Ollie. Please.

925
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,925
Some target shooting.

926
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,188
State champion in '94.

927
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,127
- MAN: You're crazy if you go out there!
- NORTON: Let us pass!

928
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,131
Let us pass, please!

929
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,188
Let's just talk this thing through.

930
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,428
NORTON: We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

931
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,529
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

932
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,938
- Why don't we just sit down and just--
- What, and let you keep on talking?

933
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,101
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

934
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,304
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

935
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,368
AMANDA: Your people?

936
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,278
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

937
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,782
Now-- now listen, everyone.

938
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,842
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

939
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,911
I don't know whether
it's man-made or natural,

940
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,891
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

941
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,258
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

942
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,956
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

943
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,691
is to seek rescue.

944
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,556
We're going out.

945
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,296
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

946
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,534
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

947
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,733
Tie this around your waist.

948
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,972
What for?

949
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,139
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

950
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,373
I'll do it.

951
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,420
Are you throwing in with them?

952
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,581
Me? No thanks.

953
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,148
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

954
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,421
Gonna get somebody killed.

955
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,293
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

956
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,026
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

957
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,262
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

958
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,327
Son, you got brass balls.

959
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,103
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

960
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,163
Drive it back.

961
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,873
All right.

962
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,607
Just see they're paying out this line.

963
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,876
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

964
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,440
just so you understand.

965
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,507
DAVID: Yeah.

966
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,459
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

967
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:33,517
David...

968
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,796
there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

969
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,859
What if you're wrong?

970
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,427
Then, I guess...

971
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,466
the joke would be on me after all.

972
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,011
We're gonna send back help.

973
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,484
You'll die out there.
All of you.

974
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,430
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

975
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,097
I just don't think
he's the bloodthirsty asshole

976
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,504
you make him out to be.

977
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,304
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

978
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,901
You just chat it over at your leisure.

979
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,554
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

980
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,868
Keep it loose.

981
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,315
DAVID: Nice and easy.

982
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,655
OLLIE: (low)
Keep going.

983
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,631
(onlookers murmur)

984
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,301
JIM: Look.

985
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,745
It's going.

986
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,980
They're doing good.

987
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,582
Aah! Aaahhhh!

988
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,819
(onlookers screaming)

989
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,189
(cord whistles sharply)

990
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,267
MAN: Put it down!

991
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,605
Ohh! Pull!

992
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,914
MAN: Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

993
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,748
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

994
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,097
(onlookers scream and shout)

995
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,154
Get it off!

996
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,565
Oh, my God.

997
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,209
(woman sobbing)

998
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,750
- JIM: Aw, sh--
- MRS. CARMODY: Blood!

999
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,547
Awww, sh--!

1000
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,281
MRS. CARMODY'
Oh, my God!

1001
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,754
- (onlookers shouting)
- Oh, my God!

1002
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,057
(onlookers screaming)

1003
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,570
Cut the rope!

1004
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,276
Shut the door!

1005
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,075
Now do you see?

1006
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,578
Now do you believe?

1007
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,930
OLLIE:
About a half-hour of daylight left.

1008
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,032
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

1009
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,435
We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right.

1010
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,770
Yeah, check it out.

1011
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,366
All right, all right.
Save it, save it.

1012
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,240
These batteries ain't topped up.

1013
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,439
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

1014
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,606
How quick?

1015
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,707
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

1016
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,775
Okay, emergencies only.

1017
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,277
If something gets in the store.

1018
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,590
(sighs) Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me.

1019
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:04,155
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

1020
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,568
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

1021
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,129
- Hi.
- Hi.

1022
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,572
Barely. How about you?

1023
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,234
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.

1024
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,973
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road.

1025
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,072
That's less than
five miles from here.

1026
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,810
How 'bout yours?

1027
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,374
Well, they're out of town right now.

1028
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,014
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

1029
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,853
That's lucky.
That means they're okay.

1030
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:29,914
I hope so.

1031
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,418
So...

1032
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,023
how soon you shipping out?

1033
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,760
Uh, couple weeks.

1034
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,926
Scared about going over there?

1035
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,328
(softly)
Yeah.

1036
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,169
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

1037
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,771
How come you never asked me out?

1038
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,341
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

1039
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,408
(chuckles)

1040
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,115
So how come?

1041
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,392
I'm stupid, I guess.

1042
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,903
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

1043
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,209
Don't be. I just--

1044
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,515
I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?.

1045
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:31,780
Some shitty locker room at work.

1046
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,450
Can we just stay in here
a while, then?

1047
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,517
I mean, just-- just you and me.

1048
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,131
DAN: The parking lot lamps
turned on.

1049
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,232
OLLIE: They're on a timer.

1050
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,300
Must be a different one
that's live.

1051
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,074
DAN: Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

1052
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,013
get some electricity in here.

1053
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,745
That'd mean walking out the door.

1054
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,459
- Gaaaahhhh! God!
- (woman screams)

1055
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,799
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

WOMAN:...you sure?

1058
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:24,295
Look!

1059
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,887
My God.

1060
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,904
Are those bugs?

1061
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,313
Not like any I've ever seen.

1062
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,481
MRS. CARMODY:
"They came out of the smoke,

even as the scorpions
of the earth have power."

1066
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,888
(gasps)
Wow.

1067
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,435
Look at those stingers.

1068
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,897
Dear God.

1069
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,570
Holy shit!

Myron, get the ones in the back!

1073
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,196
God, I think they're attracted to the light.

1074

- (screaming)
- OLLIE: Look out, look out, look out!

1075

00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,772
Look out! Look out!

00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,506
(screams and weeping)

1078
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,843

DAVID: Light, light,
light, light, light!

1080

1081
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,318
"And there came a voice
from the temple

Let me see, let me see.
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see.

1101
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,353
No, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

You're fine. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

Put it on fire!

Did we get 'em all?

1168

WOMAN: She was right.

1169
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,768
She said that
it would happen like this.

1170
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,932
She said that
they would come at night.

1171
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,941
She told us someone would die.

1172
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,382
(monster snarling)

1173
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,721
(monster grunting and chewing)

1174
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,631
(grunts)
Mommy.

1175
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,230
Ohh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

1176
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,808
It's okay, it was just a dream.

1177
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,243
It's just a bad dream.

1178
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,177
BILLY: I want my mommy.

1179
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:28,841
I know.

1180
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,182
I know. Of course you do.

1181
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,813
- Shh.
- BILLY: I wanna go home.

1182
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,379
Just sleep.

1183
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,420
Everything'll be better in the morning.

1184
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,591
Think he likes you.

1185
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,696
(low) Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him.

1186
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,265
You have kids?

1187
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,537
No.

1188
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,772
I always wanted to, but...

1189
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,542
things haven't been working out.

1190
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,854
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

1191
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:10,822
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that--

1192
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,554
they shouldn't exist.

1193
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,554
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

1194
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,295
You're not alone in that.

1195
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,792
We're all right there with you.

1196
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,668
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1197
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,699
OLLIE: David.

1198
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,009
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

1199
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,866
(sighs)
Joe.

1200
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,532
How you holdin' up, partner?

1201
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:58,936
JOE: (labored)
David... is that you?

1202
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,532
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

1203
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:05,310
(low)
It's bad. He's bad.

1204
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:08,009
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

1205
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,350
If you guys can't help me...

1206
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,853
you-- you gotta end it, okay?

1207
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,426
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1208
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:23,421
- JOE: Right?
- No. No way.

1209
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,831
JOE: You can't fuck with me
on this, bro.

1210
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,062
Not with me like this.

1211
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,627
I'll do it.

1212
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,469
(crying)
Just give me the gun.

1213
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,168
DAVID: Hey, hey. Shh.

1214
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,337
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

1215
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,142
Joe, now, listen.

1216
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:41,205
Pal...

1217
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,411
we're gonna work something out.

1218
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,181
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay?

1219
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:46,312
Can we do that?

1220
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:48,379
(Joe weeps softly)

1221
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,853
DAVID: Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1222
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,224
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

1223
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:02,192
Hattie.

1224
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,810
See anything?

1225
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:24,188
DAN: The last of those bugs
went away about four.

1226
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,249
Dawn's coming.

1227
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,593
What's on your mind?

1228
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,652
DAVID: It's Joe.

1229
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,397
We don't get him
on some serious antibiotics,

1230
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,628
he's gonna die of infection.

1231
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,034
OLLIE: Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way.

1232
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:39,836
All-- all-- all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

1233
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,776
You-- you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

1234
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,779
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene--

1235
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,542
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

1236
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:47,604
She knows where they keep it.

1237
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:48,843
Slow down.

1238
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,579
You can't actually be thinkin'
of doin' this.

1239
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,553
I'm also thinkin' beyond that.

1240
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:54,088
We have to get out of here.

1241
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,451
I mean permanently.

1242
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,993
Why? We got plenty to eat!

1243
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,894
What happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?.

1244
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,558
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

1245
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,625
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

1246
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,830
We almost burned
the goddamn store down.

1247
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,631
(soft footsteps approaching)

1248
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,442
It's Hattie.

1249
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,079
(moving quietly)

1250
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,313
DAVID: Here?

1251
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,378
DAN: All right,
gently, now. Gently.

1252
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:29,720
BUD: One... two... three.

1253
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,531
AMANDA: I don't know
how long she was there like that,

1254
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,935
lying there next to us.

1255
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,666
I thought she was sleeping.

1256
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,906
I got my 4-wheel drive.

1257
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:49,569
It's out there.

1258
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,306
Y-you're talking about leaving?

1259
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,139
Well, we...

1260
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,081
should hit the pharmacy first.

1261
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,448
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

1262
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:58,952
I mean, if we don't,

1263
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:01,012
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen.

1264
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,084
But after that...

1265
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,754
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1266
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,058
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1267
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,461
and try to get clear of this mist.

1268
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,423
DAN: That's it?

1269
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,832
That's the plan?

1270
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,802
- That's what I got.
- No, you can't mean it.

1271
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,862
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

1272
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,408
No, no, no. Amanda, think.

1273
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,467
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store.

1274
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,034
That's how much rope played out.

1275
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,638
I'm parked half that distance
from here.

1276
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,706
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

1277
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,274
It could be
the entire eastern seaboard.

1278
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,513
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

1279
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:35,887
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1280
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,789
DAN: We have one gun.

1281
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,851
- How many rounds?
- OLLIE: We got ten left.

1282
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,088
Ten rounds. Jesus.

1283
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,790
Okay, so ten.

1284
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,790
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

1285
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,893
I'll give you the best one.

1286
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,959
Her.

1287
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,462
Mrs. Carmody.

1288
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,407
She's our very own Jim Jones.

1289
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,138
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid.

1290
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,201
He's right.

1291
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,612
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

1292
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,345
No, I don't buy that.
It's obvious she's nuts.

1293
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:04,909
Look, a few people maybe, but--

1294
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,285
No, I count four.
She's preachin' to 'em right now.

1295
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,846
By noon, she'll have four more.

1296
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,085
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

1297
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,650
she'll have a congregation,

1298
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:16,220
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1299
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:17,959
to make it all better.

1300
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,694
Hmm?

1301
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,702
You, Amanda?

1302
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,032
My little boy?

1303
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,697
DAN: He's right.

1304
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,934
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1305
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,342
None whatsoever.

1306
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:30,901
I can't accept that.

1307
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,675
People are
basically good, decent.

1308
01:12:33,748 --> 01:12:35,978
My God, David,
we're a civilized society.

1309
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,541
Sure, as long as
the machines are workin'

1310
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:38,881
and you can dial 9-1-1,

1311
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:41,821
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1312
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,881
you scare the shit out of them,

1313
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,790
no more rules,

1314
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,852
you'll see how primitive they get.

1315
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,626
You scare people badly enough,

1316
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,190
you can get 'em to do anything.

1317
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,931
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

1318
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,165
or whatever.

1319
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,231
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1320
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:02,004
OLLIE: I wish I could.

1321
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:04,409
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane.

1322
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,473
Put more than two of us
in a room, we pick sides

1323
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,109
and start dreaming up reasons
to kill one another.

1324
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,782
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1325
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:16,484
Oh, Jesus, that's just...

1326
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:17,547
wrong.

1327
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:20,186
DAVID: Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

1328
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,752
First things first--

1329
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,320
the pharmacy.

1330
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,594
That'll be our test run.

1331
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:27,657
Okay?

1332
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,606
(sighs heavily)

1333
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,710
It's all right, Big Bill.

1334
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,443
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books.

1335
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:42,848
I don't want them.

1336
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,579
I want you to stay here.

1337
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,644
I won't be gone long.

1338
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,724
Just-- just next door.

1339
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,623
Hey, you'll be safe.

1340
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:54,217
Daddy--

1341
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:55,786
Daddy, there are things out there.

1342
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,699
Things--

1343
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,668
Yeah. There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime.

1344
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:04,262
They'll wait.

1345
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,000
They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1346
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,508
and then when you go
and can't get back in...

1347
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,067
they'll come and eat you up!

1348
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,375
- Shh.
- Daddy, don't go!

1349
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,439
(sobbing)

1350
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:22,917
I'll be back.

1351
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,521
Big Bill...

1352
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,856
I promise.

1353
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,261
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home.

1354
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:31,857
All right?

1355
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,993
Together, we're going home.

1356
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:37,062
If something happens,
anything at all,

1357
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,299
you cut and run.

1358
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,001
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake.

1359
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,567
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy...

1360
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:47,604
best as you can,
and long as you can.

1361
01:14:47,684 --> 01:14:49,447
Land Cruiser's yours now.

1362
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,077
You-- you get him out of here.

1363
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,485
You just keep drivin'.

1364
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,053
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

1365
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,156
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

1366
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,327
My boy is no concern of yours.

1367
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:08,664
Listen up.

1368
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,728
We're going to the pharmacy.

1369
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,797
We're gonna bring back
some supplies.

1370
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,242
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

1371
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,472
- (onlookers murmuring)
- OLLIE: Listen, folks, listen!

1372
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,538
We're not gonna take any chances.

1373
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:22,106
If there's any trouble,

1374
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,175
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket.

1375
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:27,586
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

1376
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,146
WOMAN: She's right.

1377
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,885
You'll make 'em notice us.

1378
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,221
You'll make 'em come.

1379
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,924
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

1380
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,863
Lady, this what you call
'well enough"?

1381
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,423
You wanna stop us?

1382
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:40,991
You better explain to Bobby here

1383
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,333
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

1384
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,566
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone.

1385
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,370
You'll die out there, young man.

1386
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:50,502
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1387
01:15:50,578 --> 01:15:53,741
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

1388
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,682
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

1389
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:58,743
Do you want that
to happen, people?

1390
01:15:58,819 --> 01:16:02,016
- ONLOOKERS: No!
- MRS. CARMODY: No! No! No!

1391
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,081
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1392
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,593
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

1393
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,323
This kind of pride and defiance of--

1394
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,058
(onlookers gasp)

1395
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:11,827
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1396
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,765
You old bitch!

1397
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:20,400
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

1398
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,136
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1399
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,041
And I got lots of peas.

1400
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,706
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

1401
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,511
How 'bout it, Army?

1402
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,074
Any help from the armed forces?

1403
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,141
I'll go.

1404
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,079
IRENE: Jim Grondin.

1405
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:36,647
I had you in school, didn't I?

1406
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,693
Yes'm, me and my sister Pauline.

1407
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,421
Pair of underachievers.

1408
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,723
After you, Jim.

1409
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:44,197
Yes, ma'am.

1410
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,597
Oh, shit.

1411
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:48,067
DAVID: That it?
That's everybody?

1412
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:49,626
Everybody that's goin'.

1413
01:16:49,706 --> 01:16:51,731
- MAN: Yep.
- Okay.

1414
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:54,867
DAVID: Single file,
one by one, all right?

1415
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,672
Let's get this thing over with.

1416
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:58,802
Let's go.

1417
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,711
- MAN: After you.
- IRENE: Yes.

1418
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:04,741
Stay together.

1419
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,789
(onlookers murmuring)

1420
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,756
MRS. CARMODY'
You know what?

1421
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,315
Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.

1422
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,088
- MAN: Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1423
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,232
DAVID: Save the batteries.

1424
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,309
DAVID: (low)
Shit.

1425
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,376
They left the doors propped open.

1426
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,246
OLLIE: (low)
Think something got in?

1427
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,750
DAVID: Let's just...
get what we need,

1428
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,227
get the hell outta here.

1429
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:22,786
OLLIE: Yeah. Let's do that.

1430
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,697
IRENE: (low) The meds
are over at the end there,

1431
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,257
in the cubicle.

1432
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,683
(loud, sharp crash)

1433
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,087
DAVID: Will you not do that?

1434
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,148
JIM: (low)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1435
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,194
DAVID: (exasperated)
Oh, God.

1436
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,217
Where's that Silvadene?

1437
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:20,777
It's over behind David.

1438
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:22,687
In the fridge. Check there.

1439
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,263
Silvadene. Got it.

1440
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:32,890

1441
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,458

Any strong antibiotics.

Yeah.

1444
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:41,275
Pain meds like
Vicodin or OxyContin.

1446

DAVID: Penicillin.

1448
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,751
(soft scurrying sound)

1449
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,118
Guys.

1450
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,628
Hurry it up.
I hear something.

1451
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:12,495
What?

1452
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:14,701
(soft scurrying sound)

1453
01:20:14,775 --> 01:20:16,333
DAN: Somethin' fuckin' weird.

1454
01:20:25,914 --> 01:20:27,745
Oh, God.

1455
01:20:27,916 --> 01:20:29,213
Oh, God!

1456

Oh, nooooo.

Guys, let's get out of here now.

1463
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,504

(hoarsely)
It's our fault.

MRS. CARMODY:
...expiation, because we have seen

1551
01:25:27,615 --> 01:25:30,140
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions.

1552
01:25:30,218 --> 01:25:34,245
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

1553
01:25:34,322 --> 01:25:36,313
obscenities and profanities

1554
01:25:36,391 --> 01:25:38,723
of such nightmare proportions.

1555
01:25:38,794 --> 01:25:42,628
And for these evil,
lurking spirits,

1556
01:25:42,698 --> 01:25:44,689
and for these evil people...

1557
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:46,096
How long was I out?

1558
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,566
Most of the day.

1559
01:25:48,636 --> 01:25:51,127
You just came over here to lay down
and went to sleep.

1560
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:52,867
Just passed out, is more like it.

1561
01:25:52,941 --> 01:25:54,408
MRS. CARMODY:
What will stop this Great Whore?

1562
01:25:54,476 --> 01:25:56,569
Just shut down for a while.

1563
01:25:56,644 --> 01:25:57,633
Sorry.

1564
01:25:57,711 --> 01:25:59,076
MRS. CARMODY'
How will it end?

1565
01:25:59,147 --> 01:26:00,136
CROWD: Expiation!

1566
01:26:00,215 --> 01:26:02,843
MRS. CARMODY: Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

1567
01:26:02,917 --> 01:26:04,612
DAVID: How's Joe?

1568
01:26:04,685 --> 01:26:08,086
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

1569
01:26:08,656 --> 01:26:10,487
We were just too late.

1570
01:26:10,558 --> 01:26:11,889
MRS. CARMODY:
I told you this would come!

1571
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,360
DAVID: Oh, God,
I thought I was dreaming her voice.

1572
01:26:14,429 --> 01:26:15,760
AMANDA: No dream.

1573
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:18,025
She's getting people whipped up.

1574
01:26:18,099 --> 01:26:20,863
That poor girl is dead,

1575
01:26:20,935 --> 01:26:23,301
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1576
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:25,532
She's got 'em believing
she's a psychic,

1577
01:26:25,607 --> 01:26:27,268
she has a direct line with God.

1578
01:26:27,342 --> 01:26:29,833
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

1579
01:26:29,911 --> 01:26:32,209
Like those speeches
Castro used to make.

1580
01:26:34,949 --> 01:26:38,248
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

1581
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:39,650
I'm in.

1582
01:26:39,721 --> 01:26:41,689
DAVID: No. Sorry.

1583
01:26:41,756 --> 01:26:45,590
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby... Mike...

1584
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:46,649
I won't...

1585
01:26:46,728 --> 01:26:49,424
do that again.
I won't be responsible.

1586
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:50,964
You might want to reconsider that.

1587
01:26:51,032 --> 01:26:53,193
MRS. CARMODY:
What will-- what will keep these evil,

1588
01:26:53,268 --> 01:26:54,428
these abominations at bay?

1589
01:26:54,502 --> 01:26:55,992
What will keep them away?

1590
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:59,062
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

1591
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,539
What will end it?
Let me hear it.

1592
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,508
- Expiation!
- What are we talking about?

1593
01:27:02,677 --> 01:27:05,168
- Expiation!
- Say it again like you mean it!

1594
01:27:05,246 --> 01:27:06,543
Expiation!

1595
01:27:06,614 --> 01:27:11,608
Welcome to Sesame Street.
Today's word is "expiation."

1596
01:27:11,686 --> 01:27:13,711
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1597
01:27:13,788 --> 01:27:16,450
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy.

1598
01:27:16,524 --> 01:27:19,516
His mind's just snapped.
Gone.

1599
01:27:19,594 --> 01:27:21,084
Hasn't even been two days.

1600
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:23,687
Not even two days.

1601
01:27:23,766 --> 01:27:26,360
CORNELL: I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what.

1602
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:29,096
OLLIE: I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1603
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:32,503
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

1604
01:27:32,574 --> 01:27:34,838
DAN: It was your idea.
It's your vehicle.

1605
01:27:34,909 --> 01:27:36,399
It'll be your call.

1606
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:40,904
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

1607
01:27:40,982 --> 01:27:42,973
(Carmody's followers applaud)

1608
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,315
MRS. CARMODY:
Who will save them? No one.

1609
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:48,480
The rocks will not hide them.

1610
01:27:48,556 --> 01:27:51,320
I want some idea
of what we're up against.

1611
01:27:51,392 --> 01:27:53,053
I want to know what this mist is.

1612
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:55,555
I want to talk to the soldiers.

1613
01:27:55,629 --> 01:27:57,119
Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1614
01:27:57,198 --> 01:27:59,428
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

1615
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,832
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking.

1616
01:28:01,903 --> 01:28:03,564
The situation was insane.

1617
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:05,436
He said he was sorry.

1618
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:07,497
Wasn't that the word
he used-- "sorry"?

1619
01:28:07,575 --> 01:28:09,566
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

1620
01:28:09,644 --> 01:28:11,202
AMANDA:
What did he mean by that?

1621
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:13,770
That's what we're gonna find out.

1622
01:28:13,848 --> 01:28:15,509
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

1623
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:16,879
MRS. CARMODY'
Verse 17!

1624
01:28:16,951 --> 01:28:19,442
"...poured out his vial into the air,

1625
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,420
"and there came a great voice

1626
01:28:21,489 --> 01:28:24,219
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

1627
01:28:24,292 --> 01:28:26,783
"'It is done! It is done!'

1628
01:28:26,861 --> 01:28:30,092
"And there were voices
and lightning,

1629
01:28:30,164 --> 01:28:33,224
and thunders,
and a great earthquake."

1630
01:28:33,301 --> 01:28:35,963
MRS. CARMODY'
Yes! Come to me!

1631
01:28:36,037 --> 01:28:37,197
WAYNE: What?

1632
01:28:37,272 --> 01:28:39,502
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

1633
01:28:39,575 --> 01:28:41,839
Not that big a store.
It's kinda hard to lose.

1634
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:44,902
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

1635
01:28:48,049 --> 01:28:51,041
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

1636
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:53,553
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

1637
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:55,384
That's not what the M.P.
said in the pharmacy

1638
01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:57,287
before the spiders
came out of his skin.

1639
01:28:58,826 --> 01:29:00,589
They're not in the store.

1640
01:29:00,662 --> 01:29:03,825
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

1641
01:29:03,898 --> 01:29:04,887
...because you know.

1642
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:07,127
You saw the good face
of God tonight.

1643
01:29:07,201 --> 01:29:08,463
Yes? Tell us.

1644
01:29:08,536 --> 01:29:10,766
Here is an old man
who has seen!

1645
01:29:10,837 --> 01:29:12,998
Yes, he has seen!

1646
01:29:13,074 --> 01:29:14,063
MAN: Amen.

1647
01:29:14,142 --> 01:29:15,632
MRS. CARMODY'
And I want to say,

1648
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:17,837
do I want to walk with you

1649
01:29:17,912 --> 01:29:20,574
into my Father's hands?

1650
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:22,138
Morales.

1651
01:29:23,184 --> 01:29:24,173
Donaldson.

1652
01:29:26,855 --> 01:29:27,844
Guys...

1653
01:29:30,191 --> 01:29:31,681
It's the only place they can be.

1654
01:29:32,694 --> 01:29:33,718
WAYNE: What?

1655
01:29:33,795 --> 01:29:35,228
OLLIE:
Couldn't just disappear.

1656
01:29:35,296 --> 01:29:38,288
WAYNE: Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are--

1657
01:29:38,366 --> 01:29:40,493
(sharp gasp)

1658
01:29:45,373 --> 01:29:46,863
I didn't think they'd do it.

1659
01:29:46,941 --> 01:29:49,501
They said they would do it,
and I just--

1660
01:29:49,577 --> 01:29:51,738
I told them what
the M.P. said at the pharmacy,

1661
01:29:51,813 --> 01:29:52,973
and they swore they'd do it.

1662
01:29:53,047 --> 01:29:54,708
I just-- I didn't think they would.

1663
01:29:54,783 --> 01:29:55,772
Jesus.

1664
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:59,047
It's the Arrowhead Project,
isn't it?

1665
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,715
This mist, it's some kind of, what,
military fuckup?

1666
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,280
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

1667
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:07,226
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1668
01:30:07,295 --> 01:30:08,284
Get in there!

1669
01:30:08,363 --> 01:30:11,355
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1670
01:30:11,432 --> 01:30:14,924
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1671
01:30:15,003 --> 01:30:17,494
Those two peckerwoods that
he's been with this whole time,

1672
01:30:17,573 --> 01:30:19,973
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

1673
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:21,531
They knew it all along!

1674
01:30:21,609 --> 01:30:23,440
- He's crazy. He doesn't know--
- Get on your knees!

1675
01:30:23,511 --> 01:30:24,842
- (shouting)
- MAN: Stay out of it, Drayton!

1676
01:30:24,912 --> 01:30:26,903
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

1677
01:30:26,981 --> 01:30:28,346
All about the Arrowhead Project

1678
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:30,475
and all that secret shit
up on the mountain.

1679
01:30:30,551 --> 01:30:32,018
That's what brung it down on us.

1680
01:30:32,086 --> 01:30:34,213
That's what brung down
the wrath of God!

1681
01:30:34,288 --> 01:30:35,277
MRS. CARMODY: Oh!

1682
01:30:37,091 --> 01:30:39,025
Private Jessup.

1683
01:30:40,928 --> 01:30:42,088
It wasn't me.

1684
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:44,495
I'm just--
I'm stationed up there.

1685
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:45,964
I'm not responsible--

1686
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:47,695
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

1687
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:49,761
Most of you people know me.

1688
01:30:49,837 --> 01:30:52,328
You stop your chicken shit whining

1689
01:30:52,407 --> 01:30:55,035
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

1690
01:30:55,109 --> 01:30:56,667
Now you tell us!

1691
01:30:58,679 --> 01:30:59,873
Tell us.

1692
01:30:59,947 --> 01:31:02,609
Look, look. Okay, okay.

1693
01:31:02,683 --> 01:31:04,116
I heard stuff.

1694
01:31:04,185 --> 01:31:05,482
Stuff?

1695
01:31:05,553 --> 01:31:07,544
Yes, we all heard stuff.

1696
01:31:08,890 --> 01:31:12,656
Like how they, um,

1697
01:31:12,727 --> 01:31:14,820
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1698
01:31:14,895 --> 01:31:17,728
you know, other--
other worlds all around us,

1699
01:31:17,799 --> 01:31:20,290
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

1700
01:31:20,368 --> 01:31:21,858
a window--

1701
01:31:21,936 --> 01:31:24,530
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

1702
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:29,471
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

1703
01:31:29,544 --> 01:31:31,409
Not mine! Those scientists'!

1704
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:34,004
Oh, the scientists!
Yes, the scientists!

1705
01:31:34,082 --> 01:31:36,209
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

1706
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:38,081
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

1707
01:31:38,152 --> 01:31:41,485
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself.

1708
01:31:41,556 --> 01:31:43,547
I didn't understand the half of it.

1709
01:31:45,493 --> 01:31:47,017
It ain't my fault!

1710
01:31:47,095 --> 01:31:48,153
Oh.

1711
01:31:49,263 --> 01:31:52,596
Ain't. His. Fault.

1712
01:31:52,667 --> 01:31:55,192
- (angry murmuring)
- No, no, no.

1713
01:31:55,269 --> 01:31:56,634
Ain't nothin'

1714
01:31:56,704 --> 01:31:59,298
ever anybody's fault.

1715
01:31:59,373 --> 01:32:01,705
But he denies it.

1716
01:32:01,776 --> 01:32:04,267
He points the finger,

1717
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:07,439
this Judas in our midst.

1718
01:32:07,515 --> 01:32:08,504
CROWD: Judas!

1719
01:32:08,583 --> 01:32:10,448
David!

1720
01:32:10,518 --> 01:32:12,748
You! You!

1721
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:14,754
Don't you know by now?.

1722
01:32:14,822 --> 01:32:16,915
Don't you know the truth?

1723
01:32:16,991 --> 01:32:19,585
We are being punished.

1724
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:23,220
For what? For going
against the will of God!

1725
01:32:23,297 --> 01:32:27,563
For going against
his forbidden rules of old!

1726
01:32:27,636 --> 01:32:29,126
Walking on the moon!

1727
01:32:29,203 --> 01:32:30,693
Yes! Yes!

1728
01:32:30,771 --> 01:32:33,672
- Or-- or splitting his atoms!
- MAN: Amen!

1729
01:32:33,741 --> 01:32:36,141
Or-- or-- or stem cells

1730
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:38,474
and abortions!

1731
01:32:38,546 --> 01:32:41,515
And destroying the secrets of life

1732
01:32:41,582 --> 01:32:44,847
that only God above has any right to!

1733
01:32:44,919 --> 01:32:46,409
Amen! Amen!

1734
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:49,047
MRS. CARMODY:
Yes, I know! It is true!

1735
01:32:49,123 --> 01:32:51,614
And now we are being punished.

1736
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:54,683
The judgment is being
brought down upon us.

1737
01:32:54,761 --> 01:32:57,423
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

1738
01:32:57,498 --> 01:33:01,093
and star Wormwood blazes!

1739
01:33:01,169 --> 01:33:02,500
And it is his fault!

1740
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:05,903
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1741
01:33:05,973 --> 01:33:08,965
They did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

1742
01:33:09,043 --> 01:33:10,032
No!

1743
01:33:10,111 --> 01:33:12,306
- (angry shouting)
- MACKEY: Get over there!

1744
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:13,972
DAVID: No!

1745
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:15,675
MACKEY: Judas!

1746
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:17,973
OLLIE: Jim!

1747
01:33:18,052 --> 01:33:20,520
Kill him! String him up!

1748
01:33:23,591 --> 01:33:25,252
Stand up, you coward!

1749
01:33:25,326 --> 01:33:26,315
Unkh!

1750
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:29,761
(scattered applause)

1751
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,990
Jesus!

1752
01:33:33,968 --> 01:33:35,196
DAVID: No!

1753
01:33:35,269 --> 01:33:36,668
Aaaahhhh!

1754
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:38,898
MACKEY: Expiation!

1755
01:33:39,473 --> 01:33:40,565
- No!
- MAN: Stab him!

1756
01:33:42,143 --> 01:33:44,077
- Aaahhhh!
- Expiation!

1757
01:33:44,145 --> 01:33:46,875
Feed him to the beast!

1758
01:33:46,948 --> 01:33:48,882
Expiation!

1759
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:52,909
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

1760
01:33:54,422 --> 01:33:56,083
No, no! No!

1761
01:33:56,157 --> 01:33:58,751
Aaaaahhhhh!

1762
01:33:58,826 --> 01:34:02,057
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

1763
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:09,295
Aaahhhh!

1764
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:11,895
(crowd screaming and shouting)

1765
01:34:16,544 --> 01:34:19,035
(groans)

1766
01:34:20,181 --> 01:34:21,910
Aaahhhh!

1767
01:34:21,983 --> 01:34:25,419
(weeping)

1768
01:34:26,487 --> 01:34:27,977
(groaning and gasping)

1769
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:31,380
(door locks)

1770
01:34:31,459 --> 01:34:33,484
Aah! Aaahhh!

1771
01:34:33,561 --> 01:34:36,553
Aaahhhh!

1772
01:34:37,732 --> 01:34:39,723
Aaahhh! Aah!

1773
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,132
(monster roars)

1774
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,218
Please.

1775
01:35:01,222 --> 01:35:03,213
(onlookers scream)

1776
01:35:04,425 --> 01:35:06,256
(distant monster roars)

1777
01:35:10,865 --> 01:35:13,527
MRS. CARMODY:
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

1778
01:35:15,036 --> 01:35:16,025
Tomorrow...

1779
01:35:17,371 --> 01:35:19,862
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see.

1780
01:35:29,216 --> 01:35:30,376
BILLY: (softly)
Daddy.

1781
01:35:32,053 --> 01:35:33,213
Daddy.

1782
01:35:45,066 --> 01:35:46,897
(softly)
Sorry I left you, pal.

1783
01:35:49,236 --> 01:35:50,897
I'll never leave you again.

1784
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:53,399
Promise?

1785
01:35:54,809 --> 01:35:58,506
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1786
01:35:58,579 --> 01:36:02,015
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

1787
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:03,812
Tell me.

1788
01:36:05,519 --> 01:36:07,851
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me.

1789
01:36:11,525 --> 01:36:13,686
Ever. No matter what.

1790
01:36:15,363 --> 01:36:16,853
I promise.

1791
01:36:20,101 --> 01:36:21,898
I love you, Daddy.

1792
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:23,869
I love you, Billy.

1793
01:36:24,872 --> 01:36:26,203
More than anything.

1794
01:36:55,903 --> 01:36:57,063
(softly)
It's dawn.

1795
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:05,343
Hey, pal,
you ready to go home?

1796
01:37:05,413 --> 01:37:06,778
Come on.

1797
01:37:09,183 --> 01:37:12,175
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

1798
01:37:12,253 --> 01:37:14,744
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

1799
01:37:14,822 --> 01:37:16,119
Okay.

1800
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:19,921
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

1801
01:37:19,994 --> 01:37:22,326
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1802
01:37:22,396 --> 01:37:24,921
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

1803
01:37:24,999 --> 01:37:26,159
Let's go.

1804
01:37:49,557 --> 01:37:51,752
Stealing food now?.

1805
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:58,021
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

1806
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:00,994
Please stand aside.

1807
01:38:02,403 --> 01:38:04,963
You can't go out.
I won't allow it.

1808
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:06,370
Won't allow it?

1809
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:09,102
It's against God's will.

1810
01:38:09,176 --> 01:38:11,303
Don't you know that by now?.

1811
01:38:11,378 --> 01:38:15,940
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

1812
01:38:16,016 --> 01:38:20,453
Haven't I shown that I am his vessel?

1813
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:26,849
What's the matter with you?

1814
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:31,630
Don't you believe in God?

1815
01:38:32,633 --> 01:38:34,191
No one's interfered with you.

1816
01:38:34,268 --> 01:38:36,862
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

1817
01:38:36,937 --> 01:38:38,268
You heard him.

1818
01:38:39,874 --> 01:38:43,867
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

1819
01:38:45,145 --> 01:38:46,134
They--

1820
01:38:46,213 --> 01:38:50,149
people who refused to bend
to the will of God,

1821
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:52,811
and claim it privilege.

1822
01:38:52,887 --> 01:38:55,879
Sinners in pride.

1823
01:38:55,956 --> 01:38:57,947
Yes, haughty.

1824
01:38:58,025 --> 01:38:59,652
Privileged!

1825
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,994
They mock us. They mock our--
our God, our faith,

1826
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:07,500
our values, our very lifestyle.

1827
01:39:07,568 --> 01:39:09,729
They mock our humility

1828
01:39:09,803 --> 01:39:11,634
and our piousness.

1829
01:39:11,705 --> 01:39:14,868
They piss on us and laugh.

1830
01:39:18,112 --> 01:39:19,773
It's from them

1831
01:39:19,847 --> 01:39:23,374
the blood of human sacrifice
must come.

1832
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:25,418
From them...

1833
01:39:25,486 --> 01:39:28,080
- Come on.
-...the blood of expiation.

1834
01:39:28,155 --> 01:39:29,144
JIM: Come on.

1835
01:39:29,223 --> 01:39:30,781
You try it.

1836
01:39:30,857 --> 01:39:32,188
Fuckin' try it!

1837
01:39:32,259 --> 01:39:33,726
Come on!

1838
01:39:33,793 --> 01:39:36,023
- MAN: Get 'em!
- We want the boy.

1839
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:37,358
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

1840
01:39:37,532 --> 01:39:39,625
- Yeah!
- You get back!

1841
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:40,632
The boy!

1842
01:39:42,202 --> 01:39:44,067
Grab that boy! Grab him!

1843
01:39:44,138 --> 01:39:46,470
(screaming and shouting)

1844
01:39:48,108 --> 01:39:49,439
Grab him!

1845
01:39:51,045 --> 01:39:52,910
And get the whore too!

1846
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:54,446
Grab her!

1847
01:39:54,515 --> 01:39:56,949
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

1848
01:39:57,017 --> 01:39:58,507
(gunshot)

1849
01:39:58,587 --> 01:40:00,248
(onlookers gasp and fall silent)

1850
01:40:07,827 --> 01:40:09,920
(gunshot)

1851
01:40:09,996 --> 01:40:11,930
(onlookers scream)

1852
01:40:11,999 --> 01:40:13,830
MAN: Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

1853
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:22,402
I-- I killed her.

1854
01:40:24,578 --> 01:40:25,567
Thank you, Ollie.

1855
01:40:27,749 --> 01:40:29,011
Let's go.

1856
01:40:30,084 --> 01:40:33,281
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please.

1857
01:40:35,756 --> 01:40:37,451
WOMAN:
You killed her!

1858
01:40:37,524 --> 01:40:39,856
You murdered her!

1859
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:44,920
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,

1860
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,627
not if there'd been any other way.

1861
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,190
That's why I said thank you.

1862
01:40:48,268 --> 01:40:49,428
Okay.

1863
01:40:49,503 --> 01:40:51,835
Okay, then...
let's go!

1864
01:40:51,905 --> 01:40:53,736
(sharp thud)

1865
01:40:53,808 --> 01:40:54,797
Get up, Myron!

1866
01:40:54,874 --> 01:40:56,136
Come on! We gotta go!

1867
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:57,199
My ankle!

1868
01:40:57,277 --> 01:40:59,768
(women sobbing softly)

1869
01:41:05,686 --> 01:41:07,813
Okay. All the way down!

1870
01:41:08,856 --> 01:41:10,483
Where are they?

1871
01:41:10,557 --> 01:41:12,388
Bud! Myron!

1872
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,484
Ambrose!

1873
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,152
I think I broke it!

1874
01:41:15,229 --> 01:41:16,787
Come on! Come on!

1875
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:18,353
AMANDA: We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

1876
01:41:18,432 --> 01:41:19,660
IRENE: They're lost!

1877
01:41:21,201 --> 01:41:23,169
(Amanda gasping)

1878
01:41:27,374 --> 01:41:29,001
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ollie!

1879
01:41:29,076 --> 01:41:31,636
- Ollie!
- (monster roars)

1880
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,702
Aaahhhh!

1881
01:41:33,781 --> 01:41:35,715
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1882
01:41:35,783 --> 01:41:37,808
- Oh!
- Aaahhh!

1883
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,981
(screaming and shouting)

1884
01:41:43,057 --> 01:41:46,857
(Ollie screaming)

1885
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:50,719
AMANDA: Ohh!

1886
01:41:50,798 --> 01:41:53,198
Aaah! Aaaahhhh!

1887
01:41:55,602 --> 01:41:57,661
Aaah! Aaaaahhhhh!

1888
01:42:11,385 --> 01:42:12,716
IRENE: All that screaming!

1889
01:42:13,888 --> 01:42:16,186
DAN: Are they out there?
Can they see us?

1890
01:42:16,256 --> 01:42:18,884
(honks car horn)

1891
01:42:26,066 --> 01:42:28,466
Let me-- let me in!
Let me in!

1892
01:42:28,535 --> 01:42:32,528
(screaming)

1893
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,400
(screams die)

1894
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:44,406
Are we going?

1895
01:42:51,258 --> 01:42:52,520
- No.
- Yeah.

1896
01:42:52,594 --> 01:42:54,687
- No! No!
- Yeah!

1897
01:42:54,763 --> 01:42:56,094
- Daddy.
- David.

1898
01:42:56,163 --> 01:42:58,097
- David, no.
- Daddy, no.

1899
01:42:58,165 --> 01:42:59,928
- David!
- Daddy!

1900
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:01,491
Get back in the car!

1901
01:43:01,568 --> 01:43:03,229
- Daddy!
- David!

1902
01:43:03,303 --> 01:43:04,668
(screaming)

1903
01:43:04,738 --> 01:43:06,831
(monster shrieking)

1904
01:43:13,546 --> 01:43:15,241
Oh, my God!

1905
01:43:15,315 --> 01:43:16,612
Aaahhh!

1906
01:43:16,683 --> 01:43:18,014
(shrieking)

1907
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:20,076
AMANDA:
Oh, my God!

1908
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,229
We gotta go.

1909
01:43:44,077 --> 01:43:45,135
(engine starts)

1910
01:45:31,218 --> 01:45:33,049
(distant monster roars)

1911
01:45:37,891 --> 01:45:40,382
(distant monster roars)

1912
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:42,428
DAVID: I told her I'd fix it.

1913
01:45:45,832 --> 01:45:47,766
Frontwindow...

1914
01:45:47,834 --> 01:45:49,165
broken open.

1915
01:45:52,906 --> 01:45:54,066
Tree.

1916
01:45:56,243 --> 01:45:57,232
My...

1917
01:45:58,312 --> 01:45:59,643
grandfather's tree.

1918
01:46:06,219 --> 01:46:09,985
(distant monster roars)

1919
01:46:14,696 --> 01:46:18,029
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry.

1920
01:46:33,113 --> 01:46:34,102
DAVID: Let's, uh...

1921
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:37,610
see how far this...

1922
01:46:39,386 --> 01:46:41,581
fuel takes us, huh?

1923
01:46:44,726 --> 01:46:46,717
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist.

1924
01:47:50,724 --> 01:47:52,214
(giant, heavy footsteps)

1925
01:47:59,499 --> 01:48:00,989

DAN: Well...

1933
01:50:05,458 --> 01:50:07,449
we gave it a good shot.

1934
01:50:08,895 --> 01:50:10,385
Nobody can say we didn't.

1935
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:14,094
Nope.

1936
01:50:14,167 --> 01:50:15,998
Nobody can say that.

1937

1940
01:51:45,091 --> 01:51:46,080
Well...

1941
01:51:48,261 --> 01:51:49,785
We got, uh...

1942
01:51:54,267 --> 01:51:55,256
four.

1943
01:51:59,939 --> 01:52:00,928
Four bullets.

1944
01:52:05,545 --> 01:52:07,035
But there's five of us.

1945
01:52:17,556 --> 01:52:19,319
I'll figure something out.

1946
01:52:21,761 --> 01:52:23,251
(bullet drops into chamber)

1947
01:52:29,336 --> 01:52:32,430

Aaahhh!

1952
01:53:34,901 --> 01:53:37,665
(weeping loudly)

1953
01:53:56,689 --> 01:54:00,489
(dry firing)

1954
01:54:18,044 --> 01:54:19,534
Come on!

1955
01:54:25,551 --> 01:54:26,882
Come on!

1956
01:54:28,188 --> 01:54:29,678
Come on!

1957
01:54:33,059 --> 01:54:36,028
(softly)
Come on. Come on.

1958
01:54:36,095 --> 01:54:39,326

(helicopter passes overhead)

1968
01:56:34,647 --> 01:56:37,138
They're-- they're dead.

1969
01:56:37,216 --> 01:56:38,706
For what?

1970
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:43,313
(crying)

1971
01:56:43,389 --> 01:56:45,380
