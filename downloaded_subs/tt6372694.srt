00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,250
Banzai!

3
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:56,187
Get your hands up!
Get down! Get down!

4
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,555
You, get down! Get down!

5
00:01:58,588 --> 00:01:59,924
Put your hands
where I can see them!

6
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:01,624
Give me the money!
Stay there!

7
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:02,859
Give me the money!

8
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:04,594
Come on!
Fuckin' hurry up!

9
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,130
Stay there!

10
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,032
The money! Hurry up!

11
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:11,902
Come on!

12
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:14,138
Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

13
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,354
Get it all in there!

14
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,943
- These are delicious. I'll give you some.
- Come on! Come on! Let's hurry!

15
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,844
Come on! Come on!

16
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:22,179
Come on!

17
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,741
Hey.

18
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,010
Hey.

19
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,462
This is a bracelet of hope.

20
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,715
Thank you!

21
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:26,137
Bernice, what are
we going to do?

22
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,073
Whatever we want to do.

23
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:31,708
We've never been
outside our house before.

24
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:33,776
Are we free?

25
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,447
Is this what it feels like?

26
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,216
I think it feels
much better than that.

27
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:11,909
I'm not a prisoner!

28
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,379
Kagome kagome

29
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,218
The bird in the cage.

30
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,556
When, oh, when will it come out

31
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:34,311
In the night of dawn

32
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,857
The crane and turtle slipped

33
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,320
Who is behind you now?

34
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,239
Good to see you children.

35
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,942
The Governor!

36
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,822
Come on, let's move!

37
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,161
Cocksucker, motherfucker.

38
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:02,639
Let me see your balls!

39
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:19,122
Don't mess my white shoes up!

40
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:27,130
- Is this him?
- Yes, sir, Governor.

41
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:29,800
He's a mean looking cuss,
ain't he?

42
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,269
They say...

43
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:35,038
you're a veritable phantasm,

44
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:38,408
that you have slipped through
the firm grasp of the law

45
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:41,478
more than any other man
on God's great earth.

46
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:44,548
They also say...

47
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:49,553
you're the one who robbed the
Bleufeur National Bank in P29,

48
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:53,457
killing, among others,

49
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,825
three tellers,

50
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,727
two security guards,

51
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,329
a retired Navy colonel,

52
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,731
his mother,

53
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,566
and a small boy,

54
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:08,338
whose only crime was masticating
a sweet cheery cherry gumball.

55
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:19,116
Suit, please, Yasujiro.

56
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,558
My granddaughter, Bernice,
has been lost to us, sir.

57
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:32,229
Ah, thank you, Yasujiro.

58
00:11:32,262 --> 00:11:35,132
Bernice.

59
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:38,302
I have a fondness
for black leather.

60
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:46,476
I tell you truly, sir,

61
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,211
my granddaughter,

62
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:51,315
my sweet sugar pie,

63
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:52,849
I would have her returned to me.

64
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:57,721
I would have her
returned to me posthaste.

65
00:11:57,754 --> 00:12:00,324
And you, sir...

66
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:02,726
you, sir, I am told,

67
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,228
are the man to do the job.

68
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,501
Bernice.

69
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:16,673
Bernice!

70
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:18,775
Bernice! Bernice!

71
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,744
Uh, Yasujiro.

72
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,116
Bernice...

73
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,162
Oh, my gosh.

74
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:41,131
I've seen better.

75
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,739

was too large for the shelf ♪

76
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:54,277

My, my!

90
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:47,965
Don't that fit nice and snug.

91
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,903
Just beyond the point
where we now stand

92
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:53,770
lies a stretch of highway

93
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:56,373
where evil reigns.

94
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:58,775
It's ghost!

95
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:00,243
Ghost, I tell you!

96
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:01,611
Ooh!

97
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:05,415
In the way of the road!

98
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,651
- They can be anywhere.
- Shut up!

99
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,954
Now you see them.
Now you don't.

100
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:11,022
I said shut up!

101
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:13,690
Oh, it's alright, Sheriff.

102
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:18,729
I know many who subscribe
to that...

103
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:22,866
supernatural mumbo jumbo.

104
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,469
Ghosts...

105
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,871
perhaps.

106
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:29,941
Or, maybe, it's a bunch

107
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,675
of godless sodomites

108
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,980
that have taken
the land prisoner.

109
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:40,283
I fear my sweet Bernice

110
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:44,321
has fallen
into their perverse lair.

111
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,296
I can see why you
want her back.

112
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,331
What did he say?!

113
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:56,901
I'll kill you!

114
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:33,837
Yahhh!

115
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:49,619
No man is yet to be

116
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:52,990
a worthy opponent
for my Yasujiro.

117
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:56,961
I warn you, sir,
to quarrel with me is a mistake

118
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:59,763
many men have made
never to make again.

119
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,139
Better zip up there.

120
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:10,107
You don't want
to catch a cold.

121
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,929
It's a remarkable device,
isn't it?

122
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:36,433
Let me point out some
of its finer qualities.

123
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:40,037
Each arm is equipped
with an explosive device.

124
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:43,506
Oh, it's a protective measure.

125
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,910
These devices are connected

126
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:47,811
to a neuro sensor,

127
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:49,881
which can recognize the impulse

128
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:53,150
of a man intending
to strike a helpless woman.

129
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:56,453
Should that impulse be detected,

130
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:59,723
an alarm will sound
and if unheeded,

131
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:02,826
detonation will occur.

132
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:07,965
Your trousers are also
equipped with explosives.

133
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,600
The one at each testicle.

134
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,539
Boom!

135
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:19,176
Really?

136
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,113
I would have my Bernice
returned to me unsoiled, sir,

137
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:25,749
so best mind your manners.

138
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:31,621
Oh, now, I'm sure you've noticed
the charges around your throat.

139
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:35,059
You attempt to remove
or alter in any way

140
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,929
this magnificent wardrobe...

141
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:40,764
well,
I think you get the idea, sir.

142
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:47,905
If you can crawl your dog's hide
into the unknown and the unholy,

143
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,639
rescue my Bernice,

144
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:53,077
return her to me unscathed
to this very spot,

145
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,612
you will walk away a free man.

146
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:57,514
No!

147
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:59,749
Don't give my sister to him!

148
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:01,651
He's the devil.

149
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,553
A real devil!

150
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,192
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

151
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:09,927
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

152
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,862
Da-da-da-da-da-da!
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

153
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:17,168
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

154
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:22,505
Well, I assume you have
accepted my offer.

155
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,143
Shin?

156
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:29,512
Give the man the keys
to his automobile.

157
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,719
What is this?

158
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:39,622
Each bulb
on that colorful display

159
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:42,792
indicates
the passing of 24 hours.

160
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:45,729
at the conclusion
of three days,

161
00:18:45,762 --> 00:18:47,630
Bernice must speak her name

162
00:18:47,664 --> 00:18:50,067
into
the spectrograms microphone.

163
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:53,803
It is programmed
to identify her lovely voice.

164
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:56,907
Once voiceprint recognition
has been achieved,

165
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,843
the device will reward you
with two extra days

166
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:02,246
to complete your task.

167
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,215
At the end of five days,

168
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:06,283
if you have not
returned with Bernice

169
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:10,820
to get your suit
unlocked and removed,

170
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:14,791
the explosives will
detonate all at once.

171
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:17,028
I am certain this will prompt

172
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:21,165
a speedy execution of your task.

173
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:23,067
You got me, son?

174
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,735
What are you
gonna unlock it with?

175
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,974
Why...

176
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,608
right here.

177
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,148
Godspeed.

178
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:42,253
Any God can bear
to look upon your face.

179
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,034
Wait!

180
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,635
You cheap villainous maggot!

181
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,704
What a badass.

182
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:37,174
He's so cool.

183
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:33,297
Not much time, huh?

184
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,135
Alright.

185
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:42,973
Alright.

186
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,902
It's alright!
Don't worry!

187
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:10,547
Don't touch my arm,
you fuckin' vermin.

188
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,616
I'm not vermin!
I'm a man!

189
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,518
Man right here!

190
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,112
What happened to Stella?

191
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:45,582
Bernice?

192
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:48,419
- Bernice?
- I'm not Bernice.

193
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:30,025
Where did you come from?

194
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,611
Do you want to join us?

195
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,906
There are so many of us.

196
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:39,618
What's your name?

197
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,996
Can't you speak?
Say something!

198
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,041
Hey! Talk!

199
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:55,384
We are almost there!
Hang in there!

200
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,845
Keep the time from moving!

201
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,835
If time starts moving...

202
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,755
...everything will explode again!

203
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:18,342
Keep time from moving!

204
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,099
Thick red blood!

205
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,102
He has thick red blood!

206
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,850
The Prophecy!
Time will move again!

207
00:29:34,912 --> 00:29:36,279
Thick red blood!

208
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:38,348
He has thick red blood!

209
00:29:38,382 --> 00:29:41,351
It is time!

210
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,741
Thick red blood!

211
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,993
Maybe someday...

212
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,213
...these children can drink
wonderful water...

213
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:48,225
No! No, no, no.
Don't touch me.

214
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:50,330
- Don't touch me. No, no, no.
- ...breathe wonderful air. live in a wonderful world!

215
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:52,279
Let go. No, no.

216
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:54,756
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Feel the fresh blood on their faces!

217
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,415
No!

218
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:12,849
I'll karate chop you!

219
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,773
Stop it!

220
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,255
All is in pain.

221
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:23,593
You must surrender to fate.

222
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:25,495
You have wandered off your path

223
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:28,432
and stumbled
into unknown danger.

224
00:30:28,465 --> 00:30:30,834
You were fortunate
the Ratman and his rat clan

225
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:32,469
found you along the highway

226
00:30:32,502 --> 00:30:34,371
and brought you
to the Ghostland.

227
00:30:34,404 --> 00:30:38,875
Perhaps you should
offer him gratitude.

228
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:42,679
Hi-fucking-yah!

229
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:45,449
Hi-fucking-yah!

230
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,685
Ratman! Get the fuck out!

231
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:57,594
You know something?

232
00:30:57,627 --> 00:30:59,496
You people...

233
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:02,866
are all fucking nuts.

234
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,769
What brings you to our land?

235
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,774
Who wants to know?

236
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:15,278
I am Enoch, leader of our tribe.

237
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:17,681
Who are you?

238
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:20,617
Nobody.

239
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,386
Just a guy looking for a girl.

240
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,991
Soon as I find her,
I'm out of here.

241
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:29,593
This is the Ghostland,
my friend.

242
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,828
The land of no escape,

243
00:31:31,862 --> 00:31:35,799
only... endurance and survival.

244
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:39,603
This is the girl
I'm looking for.

245
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:42,006
Her name's Bernice.

246
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,908
She disappeared out here

247
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:46,843
while joyriding with her friend.

248
00:31:46,878 --> 00:31:49,446
Any of you whack-jobs see her?

249
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:53,350
She was with me!

250
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:54,718
Still run from home.

251
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:56,419
But Bernice wouldn't go back.

252
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,089
Did anyone else see her?

253
00:31:58,122 --> 00:32:00,690
- I saw her!
- I saw her, too.

254
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:04,494
Where!? Where is she?

255
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:06,797
She's up in the mannequins.

256
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,929
Go find her yourself!

257
00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:20,510
No! No, stop doing that.

258
00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:22,746
How dare you?!

259
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:24,882
I said, don't touch it!

260
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,989
Treat it gently.

261
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:35,893
That's my masterpiece.

262
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,937
She needs darkness to comfort.

263
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,905
Cover the light!

264
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,827
The ghosts
saves souls like hers.

265
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:14,464
The sweetest and youngest
at first.

266
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:16,533
The ghosts exploit their fear.

267
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:18,903
They want power and freedom.

268
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:21,138
The ghosts are prisoners, too.

269
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:23,707
But I protect them.
I hide them!

270
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,710
We are not the ones
who hold her captive.

271
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:35,819
You're coming with me.

272
00:33:35,852 --> 00:33:40,124
Little cookie stay with us!
She can't go out there!

273
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:42,960
Let's go.

274
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:47,864
Then I will have
that child instead.

275
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:51,102
What's wrong with you?

276
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:52,169
Talk!

277
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:53,770
She cannot.

278
00:33:53,803 --> 00:33:56,539
That power has been
taken from her.

279
00:33:56,573 --> 00:34:00,677
This prison has taken
something from us all.

280
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,679
Our voice.

281
00:34:02,712 --> 00:34:04,215
Our hope.

282
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:07,084
Our courage.

283
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:10,888
From these innocent children,
the demon has taken the most.

284
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,991
shaken them with such
terrible horror

285
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:17,627
the the children,
they lose all will to live.

286
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:20,864
She must reclaim it herself.

287
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,669
If she is to survive.

288
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,571
Everyone!

289
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:31,592
It's time to read.

290
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:33,144
Your grandpa sent me to get you!

291
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:35,046
Now it's time to go
the fuck home!

292
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:41,085
Alright. Alright.
Alright. Okay.

293
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:42,987
Let's just, uh...

294
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,554
Bernice...

295
00:34:44,587 --> 00:34:45,923
we're friends here, right?

296
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:47,992
Let's just...

297
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:49,894
go the fuck home.

298
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:52,129
Look. Look.

299
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:53,898
It's your friends.

300
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:56,833
Your friends, remember?

301
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:58,568
Bernice, it's your friends.

302
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:00,271
See?

303
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:02,239
N-Now, wait.

304
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:07,044
Good.

305
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:09,612
Good.

306
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:13,217
We'll have you singing karaoke
in no time.

307
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:20,690
Take me with you!

308
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:22,625
Take me!

309
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:25,029
- Me, too!
- Don't take this girl!

310
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:28,832
The demon is too powerful
to escape.

311
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:43,180
But the demon!

312
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:46,283
She murders anyone
attempting to escape.

313
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:48,252
Turn around!

314
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:55,126
What are you doing?

315
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:13,110
Do you work too hard?

316
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:15,012
Well, that's right.

317
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:18,015
Power!
It has a lot of power!

318
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:20,784
I've been working on my truck.

319
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,319
They hear an engine.

320
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:25,755
They hear anything
with an engine.

321
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:26,957
They say...

322
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:29,193
an engine attracts the demon.

323
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:31,095
Is that so?

324
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:33,330
Cool. Cool.

325
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:36,000
You got any fuel for it?

326
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,069
I have fuel, yeah.

327
00:36:38,102 --> 00:36:42,373
I've been taking it from
every car that comes through.

328
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:44,841
And right there is my oil can.

329
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:46,210
Nice work, Ratman.

330
00:36:46,243 --> 00:36:48,645
I'll borrow one.

331
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:55,319
I'll give it to you,
but I won't go with you.

332
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:57,221
Never! Never!

333
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:34,724
- <i>Say your name...</i>
- Alright.

334
00:37:34,757 --> 00:37:37,827
Let's take care
of this right now.

335
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:41,332
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

336
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,972
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

337
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:51,075
Speak into the microphone.

338
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:52,977
Come on, say your name.

339
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,379
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

340
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:59,183
Say your name, Bernice!

341
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:02,286
Say your fucking name,
or tomorrow, we'll explode.

342
00:38:04,955 --> 00:38:07,158
Alright. Alright.

343
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:08,725
Fuck it.

344
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:11,028
I'll have you home
by tomorrow night.

345
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,999
Why don't I help you

346
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:17,067
take it off?

347
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,036
Come on.

348
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,809
Take it off.

349
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:28,711
Take it...

350
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:31,115
Take it all off.

351
00:38:31,148 --> 00:38:33,184
Baby, take it off.

352
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:35,085
Take it... Take it off.

353
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,154
Take it off.

354
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:41,992
Well, that's quite
a scar you got there.

355
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:43,894
You get that roller skating?

356
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:46,363
Whoo!

357
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:49,233
Take it off.

358
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:52,336
Take it... Take it off.

359
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:54,939
Take it off.

360
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:56,307
Take it off.

361
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,874
Take it off.

362
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,410
Take it off.

363
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,413
Open your mouth.

364
00:39:09,053 --> 00:39:11,422
Oh! Yeah!

365
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:15,226
Fuck you!

366
00:39:17,494 --> 00:39:18,861
Oh!

367
00:42:27,151 --> 00:42:28,485
Banzai!

368
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:32,456
Get your hands up!
You get down! Get down!

369
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,024
Put your hands
where I can see them.

370
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:35,559
Give me the money.
Say there!

371
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:36,960
Give me the money!

372
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,495
Come on!
Fuckin' hurry up!

373
00:42:38,529 --> 00:42:40,230
Stay down!

374
00:42:40,264 --> 00:42:42,132
The money! Hurry up!

375
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:46,270
Come on!

376
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:49,540
Come on! Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

377
00:42:49,573 --> 00:42:51,275
Come on!

378
00:42:51,308 --> 00:42:52,559
Get all of it!

379
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:55,117
These are delicious.
I'll give you some.

380
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,548
Come on! Come on!

381
00:42:57,581 --> 00:43:00,651
Alright.

382
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:02,719
What the fuck,
you're gonna shoot a kid?!

383
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,600
- Did you take your medication?!
- Did you take yours?!

384
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:44,341
You coward! Traitor!

385
00:47:47,671 --> 00:47:49,439
Bernice.

386
00:48:18,102 --> 00:48:19,836
It was me.

387
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:24,508
I'm the one.

388
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,412
I'm sorry.

389
00:49:09,686 --> 00:49:12,756
Bernice, no!
Don't touch me!

390
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:14,624
Who's rubbing up on me?!

391
00:49:14,658 --> 00:49:18,428
Let go of me!

392
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:20,131
Let go of me!

393
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:22,566
Stop! Get away!

394
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:23,690
Many years ago,
when I was just a child

395
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:28,195
There was a catastrophic wreck,
at mile 244...

396
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:31,281
It was the age of nuclear towers.

397
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,284
There was a massive reactor,

398
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:38,497
strong enough to power an empire,

399
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,457
...or destroy it.

400
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:46,672
Beneath it all...
the waste, the boiling toxic waste.

401
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,258
Buried, hidden, unclean.

402
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,968
The hidden secret legacy.

403
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,972
A mighty tanker burdened with
molten nuclear sludge.

404
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,935
On the searing highway
outside of the city... lost control.

405
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:05,482
It struck a transport carrying
deadly convicted men.

406
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:10,737
Covering them all with
the scalding atomic disease.

407
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:14,992
The burning!
The hideous burning!

408
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:19,121
The fire crept into the soil,
the ancient polluted earth

409
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:23,250
Every stone and tree had
sucked up the buried poison.

410
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,628
The entire city burst into flames!

411
00:51:30,727 --> 00:51:33,530
Why didn't anyone help?

412
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,573
We called for help!

413
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,534
We called to the powerful
men in the atomic towers.

414
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:02,539
But the men of the toxic
empire could not confess it.

415
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,791
They must deny it...

416
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,460
Deny them all.

417
00:52:07,965 --> 00:52:10,600
How do I get out of here?

418
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:23,185
You found Bernice. The innocent soul.

419
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,229
Gave her a chance.

420
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:27,689
You are a hero.

421
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:43,968
<i>Speak your name.</i>

422
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:46,203
<i>Bernice, this is grandpa.</i>

423
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:49,572
<i>I order you to say your name.</i>

424
00:52:53,277 --> 00:52:56,247
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

425
00:53:00,317 --> 00:53:03,054
<i>Say your name
and get in the car, Bernice.</i>

426
00:53:03,087 --> 00:53:06,756
<i>This gentleman will
escort you back home.</i>

427
00:53:10,895 --> 00:53:14,031
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

428
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:19,236
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

429
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,309
<i>Say your name to
Grandpa's friend, Bernice.</i>

430
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:33,683
I am Bernice.

431
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:39,056
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

432
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,929
I... am... Bernice.

433
00:53:44,962 --> 00:53:47,164
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

434
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,302
I am... Bernice!

435
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:52,802
<i>Speak your name
into the microphone.</i>

436
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:55,738
I am Bernice!

437
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:08,919
Get up.

438
00:54:08,953 --> 00:54:11,255
Get up!

439
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:12,990
Get up!

440
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,294
Get up!

441
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:20,931
Get up!

442
00:54:20,965 --> 00:54:23,033
Get up!

443
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:24,435
Get up!

444
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:29,173
Get up!

445
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:33,710
Get up!

446
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,253
Get up.

447
00:54:47,124 --> 00:54:48,825
Get up!

448
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:54,131
Hurry up, ladies!

449
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,865
Come on!

450
00:55:00,037 --> 00:55:02,306
Everybody, drink!

451
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,223
It's empty!

452
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,016
I'm sorry!

453
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:18,861
Governor, you command all the time.

454
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:22,489
You are the time!

455
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:27,035
You are the greatest and
most powerful clock.

456
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:30,831
And your second hand is sharp and
more dangerous than a knife!

457
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,970
Please!

458
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:39,109
No.

459
00:55:39,143 --> 00:55:41,912
Come sit on grandpa's lap.

460
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:43,147
I won't!

461
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,348
Get over there!

462
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:46,849
Make her move!

463
00:55:46,884 --> 00:55:48,919
Hey, Susie. Come on.

464
00:55:50,487 --> 00:55:53,057
Come on.

465
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,260
It's been two days already.

466
00:55:56,293 --> 00:55:59,897
It's been two days,
and still, she is missing.

467
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,033
He'll get the job done,
Governor. I promise.

468
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:06,136
- I will...
- Bring me America.

469
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:09,273
Governor?

470
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:12,543
Do you understand anything?

471
00:56:12,576 --> 00:56:14,979
Yes, Governor!

472
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:20,850
Yasujiro.

473
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:22,819
Yasujiro!

474
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:29,460
Here, go... go... go
toss those around some.

475
00:56:29,493 --> 00:56:31,528
Make it rain, baby!

476
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:33,430
Make it rain!

477
00:56:33,464 --> 00:56:36,900
Yeah! Yeah!

478
00:56:36,934 --> 00:56:40,170
Make it rain, baby!
Make it rain!

479
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:45,175
Bring everyone!
Bring my nice young daughter.

480
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:47,945
Bring Susie
and her fresh young body.

481
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:49,913
Stop!

482
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:57,054
Did you know
when Bernice is coming back?

483
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,822
Do you?!

484
00:56:59,856 --> 00:57:03,494
Bernice will come back!

485
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:05,362
Oh, is that so?

486
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:08,299
Well, tick-tock, tick-tock.

487
00:57:08,332 --> 00:57:10,200
Time waits for no one!

488
00:57:10,234 --> 00:57:11,402
Say it!

489
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:14,038
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

490
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:16,273
Tick-tock.

491
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,175
- Tick-tock.
- That's good!

492
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:20,077
That's good!
Now the second hand.

493
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,845
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

494
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,949
Tick... tock. Tick tock!

495
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:27,351
Yeah! Louder!

496
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:29,953
- Tick-tock, tick-tock!
- Tick-tock, tick-tock!

497
00:57:29,987 --> 00:57:32,890
Yes, you will be
my clock until Bernice returns.

498
00:57:32,923 --> 00:57:35,059
- Tick-tock, tick-tock!
- Louder!

499
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:37,561
- Tick-tock, tick-tock!
- Governor. Governor!

500
00:57:37,594 --> 00:57:40,331
The traitor has returned.

501
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:05,389
Did you seduce her?

502
00:58:05,422 --> 00:58:07,624
Give her notions?

503
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:09,526
Did you tell her to run from me?

504
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,296
No!

505
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:14,898
It was her idea.

506
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:17,134
That's a lie.

507
00:58:21,472 --> 00:58:23,574
Yasujiro!

508
00:58:31,482 --> 00:58:35,252
Believe me, Yasujiro.

509
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:37,554
Please.

510
00:58:54,438 --> 00:58:57,174
It's beautiful.

511
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:01,145
I'm so happy.

512
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:09,253
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

513
00:59:09,286 --> 00:59:14,091
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

514
00:59:14,124 --> 00:59:18,395
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

515
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:23,066
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

516
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,503
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

517
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:30,474
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

518
00:59:30,507 --> 00:59:33,744
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

519
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:37,381
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

520
00:59:37,414 --> 00:59:40,651
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

521
00:59:40,684 --> 00:59:43,420
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

522
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,523
Tick... tock.

523
00:59:46,557 --> 00:59:49,993
Tick... tock.

524
00:59:50,027 --> 00:59:52,396
Tick... tock.

525
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:55,332
Tick... tock.

526
00:59:55,365 --> 00:59:57,734
"My great miseries in this world

527
00:59:57,768 --> 01:00:00,671
have been Heathcliff's miseries,

528
01:00:00,704 --> 01:00:05,008
and I watched and felt each
from the beginning..."

529
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:07,578
She must be dead!

530
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:09,413
They never should have gone.

531
01:00:09,446 --> 01:00:13,050
They could have broken free.

532
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,719
- No way!
- Quiet, everyone!

533
01:00:15,752 --> 01:00:18,322
Listen to the story.

534
01:00:18,355 --> 01:00:20,557
He's dead!

535
01:00:27,397 --> 01:00:29,266
Your voice.

536
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:33,070
How did you manage
to reclaim it?

537
01:00:33,103 --> 01:00:36,673
Those... those things!
They came out of nowhere.

538
01:00:36,707 --> 01:00:39,476
They cut anything
on that highway.

539
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,378
No one escapes the Ghostlands.

540
01:00:41,411 --> 01:00:42,746
You hear?!

541
01:00:42,779 --> 01:00:44,314
No one!

542
01:02:06,697 --> 01:02:09,833
I always had the same dream.

543
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:16,740
What did you see?

544
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:20,711
The ruins.

545
01:02:20,744 --> 01:02:23,547
The people standing there...

546
01:02:25,883 --> 01:02:27,484
...suffering.

547
01:02:33,523 --> 01:02:36,426
All the people...

548
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,395
I harmed.

549
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:44,468
But yesterday...

550
01:02:46,503 --> 01:02:49,907
...they came to me.

551
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:51,875
And they helped.

552
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,281
And I know why.

553
01:03:01,385 --> 01:03:03,487
I understand.

554
01:03:08,258 --> 01:03:11,828
They help me...

555
01:03:11,862 --> 01:03:13,898
because...

556
01:03:13,931 --> 01:03:15,967
I...

557
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,868
am...

558
01:03:17,902 --> 01:03:19,937
radioactive.

559
01:03:21,705 --> 01:03:23,908
What did you see?

560
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,979
You have a duty to complete.

561
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:35,065
We will give you another life.

562
01:04:06,516 --> 01:04:07,584
Ahh!

563
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:10,475
Hello girls!
Good evening.

564
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:13,604
There are so many pretty girls.

565
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,692
Don't I deserve a girl tonight?

566
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:21,231
You?

567
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:24,484
You are a pretty one, too.

568
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:29,828
Hey!

569
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,623
Yasujiro!

570
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:37,127
Who should I pick?

571
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,255
Did you pick already?

572
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:41,882
Yasujiro-chan!

573
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:43,383
Brother?

574
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:45,260
Brother, are you here?

575
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:48,347
Is this your sister Yasujiro?!

576
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:50,974
Show yourself now!

577
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:52,476
Brother!

578
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:54,102
Brother, are you here!

579
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:55,270
Show your face!

580
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:03,237
Kill him!

581
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:52,327
Brother wait!

582
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:54,454
I know everything!

583
01:05:56,456 --> 01:06:00,794
You work for the Governor
because of me.

584
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:05,465
He promised if you did then
he would let me go, didn't he?

585
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:07,551
That's a lie!

586
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:09,344
He is a liar!

587
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:11,847
Brother...

588
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,224
Please leave him.

589
01:06:42,106 --> 01:06:46,576
<i>My sweet little cookie.</i>

590
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,112
<i>With this peace,</i>

591
01:06:48,145 --> 01:06:51,481
<i>you will finally be mine.</i>

592
01:06:53,783 --> 01:06:57,721
<i>Forever... and ever...</i>

593
01:06:57,754 --> 01:07:00,892
<i>and ever.</i>

594
01:07:44,135 --> 01:07:47,204
Hey! Hey!

595
01:07:48,973 --> 01:07:52,575
We have to keep
the clock from moving!

596
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:09,590
Where did you come from?
Where are you from?

597
01:08:12,096 --> 01:08:13,863
Thank you.

598
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:17,221
Where did you come from?
Where are you from?

599
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,503
Where I'm from
is not much better than here.

600
01:08:20,537 --> 01:08:24,541
But I'll get you out of here.
I'll get you out of here.

601
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:27,691
Please.

602
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,611
Thank you very much.

603
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,092
Mmm.

604
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,679
Delicious.

605
01:08:43,727 --> 01:08:45,662
<i>Oishi!</i>

606
01:08:47,597 --> 01:08:49,100
<i>Oishi!</i>

607
01:08:49,133 --> 01:08:50,901
It's time.

608
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:56,511
Where are you going?
Wait.

609
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:58,305
I'm coming with you.
Where are you going?

610
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:03,227
Hero! Hey! Hero!

611
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,523
Where are you going?
Hero!

612
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:19,562
You hear this?!

613
01:09:19,596 --> 01:09:21,531
Ghostlanders!

614
01:09:23,733 --> 01:09:26,103
Tomorrow...

615
01:09:26,137 --> 01:09:27,604
we're getting out of here!

616
01:09:27,637 --> 01:09:29,739
Impossible!

617
01:09:29,773 --> 01:09:30,840
It's impossible.

618
01:09:30,874 --> 01:09:34,111
Impossible? Ha!

619
01:09:34,145 --> 01:09:35,946
If you had told me
three days ago

620
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,216
I'd be standing here
with one arm and one...

621
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,651
testicle...

622
01:09:41,684 --> 01:09:44,854
trying to reason
with you bitches...

623
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,991
I would've said impossible, too,

624
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:49,226
But I'm telling you,

625
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,627
there's a way.

626
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,329
There is <i>no</i> way.

627
01:09:52,363 --> 01:09:55,966
Yes, there is.

628
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,069
And if we don't stop them,

629
01:09:58,102 --> 01:09:59,803
they'll break free.

630
01:09:59,836 --> 01:10:01,771
They'll rule the world.

631
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:03,840
Terrorizing and killing!

632
01:10:03,873 --> 01:10:05,742
We'll be their prisoners
forever!

633
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:08,312
No, don't be afraid.

634
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:10,915
It's just telling the time.

635
01:10:25,862 --> 01:10:28,332
Now, you could stay here,

636
01:10:28,365 --> 01:10:30,901
suffer, survive.

637
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:33,104
I don't have the time!

638
01:10:33,137 --> 01:10:37,074
I got one day
to tear this shit apart!

639
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:39,843
Now, you can either help me...

640
01:10:39,876 --> 01:10:41,811
or rot.

641
01:10:51,222 --> 01:10:52,990
Ratman!

642
01:10:53,857 --> 01:10:56,393
Hey, Ratman!

643
01:10:56,427 --> 01:10:59,163
I want to make a deal with you.

644
01:10:59,196 --> 01:11:00,898
I know you're intelligent.

645
01:11:00,931 --> 01:11:03,300
You make the deal,
I give you some cheese,

646
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:05,903
maybe some pickled fish.

647
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:08,771
Where are you? Ratman!

648
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:10,874
There you are.

649
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:12,943
Come on out.

650
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,712
Would you take it easy?
I don't want to hurt you.

651
01:11:15,745 --> 01:11:17,780
I just want to talk to you.

652
01:11:17,814 --> 01:11:19,849
Come on!

653
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:23,820
What's it going to take
to fire all these cars up

654
01:11:23,853 --> 01:11:27,258
and get the hell out of here?

655
01:11:35,832 --> 01:11:37,700
Hero!

656
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:40,104
I found something cool!

657
01:11:40,137 --> 01:11:43,908
Here!

658
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:46,143
The last poor you are.

659
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,345
I knew him well.

660
01:12:34,191 --> 01:12:36,393
Step aside!

661
01:12:45,536 --> 01:12:48,805
We all die!

662
01:12:48,838 --> 01:12:51,408
Everyone dies! Dies!

663
01:12:51,442 --> 01:12:54,511
What's the meaning
of blue butterflies?

664
01:12:54,545 --> 01:12:56,947
If you touch blue butterfly,

665
01:12:56,981 --> 01:12:58,916
you're gonna die.

666
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:01,632
It doesn't matter anyway!

667
01:13:13,397 --> 01:13:15,432
Ahh!

668
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,493
Forward! Forward!

669
01:13:45,496 --> 01:13:48,399
This is great!

670
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,018
"...and the wild green park,
the valley of Gimmerton,

671
01:14:08,052 --> 01:14:09,852
with a long line of mist

672
01:14:09,887 --> 01:14:11,640
winding nearly to its top...

673
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:14,496
Hey! Ratman is having fun.
Let's go!

674
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,083
You really going?

675
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:48,485
You really going?

676
01:15:48,519 --> 01:15:50,287
He must go.

677
01:15:57,661 --> 01:15:59,696
Everybody, let's go!

678
01:16:01,298 --> 01:16:02,299
Let's go!

679
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,701
Let's go!

680
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,096
Don't you recognize me?

681
01:16:38,101 --> 01:16:40,137
This face...

682
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:42,606
is not familiar to you?

683
01:16:48,712 --> 01:16:50,647
Psycho.

684
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:06,793
It crashed into the bus
carrying violent convicts.

685
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,924
It covered them in nuclear waste.

686
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:15,969
The burning!
The hideous burning!

687
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:20,711
You're... dead.

688
01:17:22,579 --> 01:17:25,649
Burning in nuclear hell,
like everybody else.

689
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,384
You ever do that?

690
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:29,553
You ever burn in fucking hell

691
01:17:29,586 --> 01:17:32,055
because your friend
betrayed you?

692
01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:37,728
You were always so much fun
when you had a...

693
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:40,764
couple of shots of whiskey
in you.

694
01:17:40,797 --> 01:17:43,700
We used to have
so much fun, didn't we?

695
01:17:43,734 --> 01:17:45,235
Yeah.

696
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:48,171
We did.

697
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:51,775
But then you...
started blowing up little kids.

698
01:17:51,808 --> 01:17:53,510
Oh, come on.

699
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:56,446
Come on.

700
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:00,584
Ah, Psycho,
all the people we hurt...

701
01:18:00,617 --> 01:18:03,120
ghosts.

702
01:18:03,153 --> 01:18:05,355
They're ghosts.

703
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:08,125
I always thought they hated me.

704
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:10,260
But they needed me.

705
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:15,866
They came to me for help.

706
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,834
Let me help.

707
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:30,380
Alright.

708
01:18:32,349 --> 01:18:35,152
But I want you to know...

709
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:38,255
the real predator in this...

710
01:18:38,288 --> 01:18:42,225
is The Governor.

711
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,628
So, you go to The Governor,

712
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:47,397
you and Bernice,

713
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,533
and you finish it.

714
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:57,674
Time for us all to be free.

715
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:02,879
Okay.

716
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:09,319
Hey!

717
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,521
Thank you.

718
01:19:58,368 --> 01:20:00,771
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

719
01:20:00,804 --> 01:20:02,839
Da-da-da-da-da-da!
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

720
01:20:04,374 --> 01:20:06,410
- Is he really coming back?
- Maybe not.

721
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:07,808
Maybe it's a lie.

722
01:20:08,378 --> 01:20:10,547
Who knows?

723
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:16,441
Here they come!

724
01:20:18,455 --> 01:20:21,358
Listen up!

725
01:20:21,391 --> 01:20:22,894
For the sake of me,

726
01:20:22,927 --> 01:20:24,962
birds will fall from the sky,

727
01:20:24,996 --> 01:20:28,598
lions and tigers
will bow before me.

728
01:20:28,632 --> 01:20:31,002
For the sake of me,

729
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:34,771
mountains and forests
would burn themselves down.

730
01:20:34,805 --> 01:20:36,673
For the sake of me,

731
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:39,443
everything will be mine.

732
01:20:39,476 --> 01:20:41,845
Welcome to my animal farm.

733
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:44,448
Long live the animal farm.

734
01:20:44,481 --> 01:20:45,983
Forever!

735
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:48,418
Long live the animal farm.

736
01:20:48,452 --> 01:20:49,887
Forever!

737
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:51,956
Long live the animal farm.

738
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:53,523
Forever!

739
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,425
Good! Good, boys!

740
01:20:55,459 --> 01:20:56,961
Alright!
That's great.

741
01:20:56,994 --> 01:20:59,030
There. There!

742
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,982
Bernice!

743
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:30,494
Bernice!

744
01:21:30,527 --> 01:21:34,631
Oh, my lord! Oh, my God!
My girl!

745
01:21:34,664 --> 01:21:36,366
My sweet honey bee!

746
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,769
Oh!

747
01:21:38,802 --> 01:21:42,405
The key.

748
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,474
Time to come home, my pet.

749
01:21:44,508 --> 01:21:47,444
Give me the key!

750
01:21:47,477 --> 01:21:50,882
I wouldn't give you a drop
of my piss, you degenerate!

751
01:21:50,915 --> 01:21:53,483
Give me the fucking key,
or I'll slit her throat!

752
01:21:54,886 --> 01:21:56,753
Give him the key.

753
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,655
Yasujiro!

754
01:22:31,621 --> 01:22:34,791
Yasujiro! Yasujiro!

755
01:23:27,178 --> 01:23:28,879
Bernice.

756
01:23:28,913 --> 01:23:32,515
Susie.

757
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,417
Don't leave me alone.

758
01:23:57,841 --> 01:23:59,043
Get out of the way!

759
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:00,443
Get out of the way!

760
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:03,014
Get out of the way!

761
01:24:03,047 --> 01:24:05,448
Bernice, am I gonna die?

762
01:24:05,482 --> 01:24:07,051
No, sweetie.

763
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:11,648
Here.

764
01:25:14,617 --> 01:25:16,287
Bernice...

765
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,589
am I gonna die?

766
01:25:19,622 --> 01:25:21,993
Don't be a fool.

767
01:25:22,026 --> 01:25:24,228
You're strong.

768
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:25,628
Run away.

769
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:28,032
Leave me and run away!

770
01:25:28,065 --> 01:25:29,599
You're safe here.

771
01:25:29,632 --> 01:25:32,869
You're safe.

772
01:25:32,903 --> 01:25:36,673
I will come back for you.

773
01:25:36,706 --> 01:25:41,312
You're not a prisoner anymore.

774
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,914
I'm not a prisoner?

775
01:25:43,948 --> 01:25:45,116
That's right.

776
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:47,650
You're not a prisoner.

777
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,221
I'm not a prisoner.

778
01:25:50,254 --> 01:25:52,289
You're not a prisoner.

779
01:25:52,323 --> 01:25:54,325
I'm not a prisoner!

780
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:56,293
Yes.

781
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:23,820
Hey, bitch!

782
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:08,359
Fuck!

783
01:28:19,904 --> 01:28:22,273
What the...

784
01:28:22,306 --> 01:28:25,036
What the hell is going...
What are you doing?!

785
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:28,987
Governor, I thought there was going to
be a statue of you in this town!

786
01:28:29,046 --> 01:28:31,282
You're such a loser!

787
01:28:33,071 --> 01:28:34,189
You don't have any money!

788
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:35,399
You are useless.

789
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,441
Loser!

790
01:28:39,089 --> 01:28:40,257
Susie!

791
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:43,027
Susie-chan!

792
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,929
Susie!

793
01:28:44,962 --> 01:28:47,064
Susie?

794
01:28:47,097 --> 01:28:51,435
Susie! Susie-chan!

795
01:30:17,288 --> 01:30:20,357
S-Susie, it's Grandpa.

796
01:30:20,391 --> 01:30:22,593
It's okay.
It's okay.

797
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,161
I'm not here to hurt you.

798
01:30:24,194 --> 01:30:26,397
Susie, plum, it's grandpa.

799
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,132

800
01:30:28,165 --> 01:30:29,866
I'm not gonna hurt you.

801
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,235
Susie? Susie?

802
01:30:31,268 --> 01:30:34,338
It's Grandpa.
It's Grandpa.

803
01:30:34,371 --> 01:30:36,307
Get the fuck away from her.

804
01:30:45,549 --> 01:30:49,920
You betrayed me, you dirty slut!

805
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:57,494
Dirty dog bitch,
you back alley trash!

806
01:30:57,528 --> 01:31:00,097
I don't need you!

807
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:01,999
I get me a new girl

808
01:31:02,032 --> 01:31:04,301

809
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:29,960

810
01:31:44,007 --> 01:31:47,344
From all the sweet bitches.

Yes!

812
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,966

01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:57,114
The Governor is dead!

816
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:02,152

817
01:33:05,289 --> 01:33:08,358
Yeah! Yeah!

818
01:33:12,696 --> 01:33:16,033
The Governor is dead!
The Governor is dead!

819
01:33:16,066 --> 01:33:17,534
Hero!

820
01:33:17,568 --> 01:33:19,770
The Governor is dead!

821
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:21,505

We are free from time!

825
01:33:49,755 --> 01:33:51,632
You can let go!

826
01:34:13,278 --> 01:34:16,448
Look, they did it!
Time is starting again! Quick!

Look, it's time!

828
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:23,333
Get going!

829
01:36:05,235 --> 01:36:07,838
Am I still alive?

830
01:36:10,942 --> 01:36:12,309
Yeah.

831
01:36:12,342 --> 01:36:14,444
You're still alive.

832
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,911
Yeah.

833
01:36:46,944 --> 01:36:52,950
