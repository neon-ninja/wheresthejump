1
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,110
Lights out!

2
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,091
<i>--struggle which followed
the death of Lenin...</i>

3
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,509
<i>...Joseph Stalin prevailed.</i>

4
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:30,397
<i>Stalin was the new face
of an old idea: Marxism.</i>

5
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,935
<i>While the Bolsheviks firmly established
their authority at home...</i>

6
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,943
<i>...the Comintern fomented revolution
throughout the world.</i>

7
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,774
<i>Communism was on the march.</i>

8
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,193
<i>Stalin was in the Kremlin.</i>

9
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,113
<i>But what of the common people?</i>

10
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,951
<i>What of the proletariat?</i>

11
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,288
<i>Those who fought to win a new world?</i>

12
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,374
<i>If we look at the history...</i>

13
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,294
They're frying someone, Pop.

14
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,428
You're on the Hades Express, mister.

15
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,009
Quiet.

16
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,641
Death is nothing to celebrate.

17
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,974
- Don't matter who it is.
- He just died.

18
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,808
His name was Wayne Fisher.

19
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:15,226
He was <i>32</i> years old,
and he killed a lady with a hammer.

20
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,688
He had a rib eye for his last meal.

21
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,653
He's been on death row
at Dewbend for three years.

22
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:27,075
- And his last words were, "Go to hell."
- How do you know that?

23
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,330
It's just in my head.

24
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,038
All right.
It's past your bedtime, children.

25
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,249
Go brush your teeth
and go to bed, please.

26
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,916
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

27
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,336
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

28
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,130
<i>...if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

29
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,893
Elise, I thought I told you
to put all these toys away.

30
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,691
You're not listening to me.

31
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,902
It wasn't me who made this mess.

32
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,440
Then who was it?

33
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,951
Christian, shut the door, please.

34
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,537
You can tell me.

35
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,466
It was the little boy.

36
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,129
He lived here a long time ago,
and he loves playing with our toys.

37
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,969
- I swear.
- I believe you.

38
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,224
I do.

39
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,104
You know,
you've been blessed with a gift.

40
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,851
You're special.

41
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,060
Some people are afraid of special people.

42
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,646
Your daddy, he's one of them.

43
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,783
He doesn't understand your gift.

44
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,950
You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?

45
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,156
Okay.

46
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,879
It's time for bed.

47
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,341
- Good night.
- Don't turn off the light, Mom.

48
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,726
I'm gonna be right out there, honey.

49
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,558
And if you ever get scared,
what do you do?

50
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,015
That's right.

51
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:22,357
I gave you this,
so that if you ever get scared, you can go:

52
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,366
Wherever I am, I'll come running.
But you gotta save it...

53
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,699
- ...for when you really need me, okay?
- Okay.

54
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,952
I love you both so much.

55
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,743
- Love you too, Mommy.
- Love you, Mommy.

56
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,096
<i>We see an actual atomic bombing run.</i>

57
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,679
<i>Heading for the target is Backseat,
code name for the ship.</i>

58
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,888
<i>The radio navigator...</i>

59
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,603
Hey.

60
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,059
What?

61
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,315
You asleep yet?

62
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,067
No.

63
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,028
Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?

64
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,073
Sometimes.

65
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,709
Do you wonder where they go
after it's done?

66
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,335
No.

67
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,422
I know where they go.

68
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,253
Oh, yeah?

69
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,917
Where?

70
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,223
They go into the dark.

71
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,033
Christian?

72
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,944
What are you doing?

73
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,898
Elise.

74
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,580
You made all the mess, didn't you?

75
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,212
Yes.

76
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,470
Where's my whistle?

77
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,724
The boy is in the closet.

78
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,136
It's okay.

79
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,644
We won't hurt you.

80
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,564
Come on out.

81
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,976
Stop it, Elise.

82
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,145
Come on out.

83
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,949
I'm not in the closet.

84
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,833
<i>The people took their revenge.</i>

85
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,746
Gerald. Gerald, no.

86
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,381
What have you done, Elise?

87
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,752
- Put your hands on the wall.
- Leave her alone.

88
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,261
Quiet, Audrey!

89
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,395
Did you see a ghost?

90
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,227
Gerald, stop it.

91
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,891
Yes.

92
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,736
I don't want to hurt you, girl.

93
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,902
Just say no. That's all you have to do.

94
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,287
I'm just gonna ask you again.

95
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,161
Did you see a ghost?

96
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,370
Yes, I did.

97
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,294
They're all around us in this house.

98
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,830
They're everywhere.

99
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,042
You don't have to do this. Please.

100
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,507
She's just a little girl, Gerald. Please.

101
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,092
No. No, Daddy.

102
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,381
No, no.

103
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,435
No, no, no. Take me. Please take me.

104
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,643
- Help me.
- Please, please, please. Gerald, stop!

105
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,104
- Please, honey, she's had enough.
- Don't. Stop.

106
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,642
Please don't. No.

107
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,939
Don't tell me how to punish her.
I punish people for a living.

108
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,277
Please!

109
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,861
Please, not in there.

110
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,151
No, no, no.

111
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,946
No, Daddy!

112
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,786
No. Daddy, please,
I don't wanna go in there!

113
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,997
No, not in there.

114
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,628
No, Daddy, please, not in there!

115
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,256
Daddy, let me out! Daddy, please!

116
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,007
You can either follow my rules...

117
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,386
...and sleep under my roof or you can
break them and sleep under my floor.

118
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,967
Don't put me in here, Daddy.

119
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,347
Daddy, please.

120
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,805
Daddy, come back.
I don't wanna be in here alone.

121
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,186
Daddy, please!

122
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,974
Are you scared of the dark?

123
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,484
Who is that? Who's there?

124
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,492
Don't be afraid.

125
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,120
I can make it light.

126
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,431
Who is that?

127
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,225
Why are you down here?

128
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,562
My daddy put me down here.

129
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,353
Your daddy doesn't treat you right.

130
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,113
Open this door.

131
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,695
There'll be lots of light.

132
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,076
Go on. Open it.

133
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,706
There's a key hanging up right there.

134
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,660
Take your time. I can wait.

135
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,501
You're the only one
that can open the door.

136
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,962
You are more powerful than you know.

137
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,925
I want you to help me open all the doors.

138
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,254
<i>Don't forget what Bill the turtle just did,
everyone...</i>

139
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,590
<i>...because we might have to do
the same thing.</i>

140
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,256
<i>That's what this is all about, my friends.</i>

141
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,094
<i>Duck and cover.</i>

142
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,601
<i>This is an official civil defense film...</i>

143
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,103
<i>...produced in cooperation
with the Federal Civil...</i>

144
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,444
Elise?

145
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,494
<i>...for the ultimate...</i>

146
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,547
Elise?

147
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,767
Audrey?

148
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,900
Audrey.

149
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,195
Audrey!

150
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,781
No, no, Audrey. Audrey, no.

151
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,913
No. No. No.

152
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,705
No, Audrey!

153
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm sorry.

154
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,216
No!

155
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,473
Good morning.

156
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,063
The dreams are coming back, Warren.

157
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,737
Just won't go away, will it?

158
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,275
How would you like breakfast in bed?

159
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,860
I thought so.

160
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,498
- You're getting old, Warren. We both are.
- I've been studying last week's footage...

161
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,127
...from the church. We missed something.
There is movement in the frame.

162
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,663
- Look.
- It's a piece of lint.

163
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,797
- Lint doesn't walk across the room.
- Behold.

164
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,255
The reason I was up all night.

165
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,549
The lights.

166
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,728
That's right, my friends.
It's voice activated.

167
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,357
No more dealing with pesky switches,
having to find them in the dark...

168
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,564
...straining fingers as you switch them.

169
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,944
Yeah, that was a real problem before,
you know.

170
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,402
Toil in the darkness of sarcasm,
my friend.

171
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:01,161
I prefer to work in the lights.

172
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,075
The lights?

173
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,627
Lights!

174
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,502
Bad acoustics.

175
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,966
Natural light's better
for the environment anyway. Voila.

176
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,381
I love that you boys are staying
in the house.

177
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,302
But please don't try to fix anything else
that isn't broken.

178
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,558
Spectral Sightings.

179
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,977
Yes, she is.

180
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,611
Elise!

181
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,783
- This is Elise.
<i>- Hey there. My name is Ted Garza.</i>

182
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,909
Nice to meet you, Mr. Garza.

183
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,616
<i>Yeah. I'm having some problems.</i>

184
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,906
<i>Things are happening in my house...</i>

185
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,872
<i>...and they say
that you know about this stuff.</i>

186
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,457
I know some things.

187
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,090
<i>Yeah, well, I was wondering
if you could take a look.</i>

188
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,844
<i>I need... I need help is the thing, see.</i>

189
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,504
May I ask where you live?

190
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:06,267
<i>I live at 414 Appletree Road...</i>

191
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,345
<i>...Five Keys, New Mexico.</i>

192
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,069
Mr. Garza...

193
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,782
...I wish I could help you,
but I really can't.

194
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,696
I'm so sorry.

195
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,037
I thank you very much
for thinking of me.

196
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,403
Sorry to drag you boys out of bed.

197
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,157
That man who called today about a job...

198
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,201
...he told me he lives in the house
that I grew up in.

199
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,252
I call it a house because it wasn't a...
A home.

200
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,513
I don't have memories from that place.
I have scars.

201
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,889
This gift I have
that you boys are so in awe of...

202
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,265
...my father tried to beat it out of me.

203
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,901
And...

204
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,608
...my mother...

205
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,697
...she was killed in that house.

206
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,862
She was murdered by something
that I brought into this world.

207
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,740
This demon wants to use my abilities...

208
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,329
...and it will hurt the ones I love
to get to me.

209
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,995
That's why I never want to go
into The Further...

210
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,255
...like I did for Quinn.

211
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,168
I have spent my life fighting
these things...

212
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,088
...because I can never forget the look
on my mother's face when she died.

213
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,766
So...

214
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,436
...I have to help this man...

215
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,562
...because I know what he's up against.

216
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,275
We'll pack up the truck tonight.
We'll get an early start tomorrow.

217
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,190
Not this time.

218
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,572
This one, I have to do...

219
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,949
...alone.

220
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,662
We have to come with you now.
This cost us 700 bucks.

221
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,797
Plus 200 for the logo paint job.

222
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,145
Before we go inside...

223
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,686
...I brought some clothes for you boys.

224
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,525
Some of it belonged to Jack,
and it's very important to me.

225
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,412
I bet I can guess who you are.

226
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,789
There's no need. I'm Elise.

227
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,084
- Hi.
- And this is Specs and Tucker...

228
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,584
...my associates.

229
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,587
She's psychic.

230
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,873
We're sidekick.

231
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,799
What was that?

232
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,962
She's psychic. We're sidekick.

233
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:39,009
- Sorry, I'm... I'm not understanding.
- Yeah, never mind.

234
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,053
You wanna come in? Here.

235
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,893
Come on. I'm supposed
to invite you in. Come on.

236
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,149
Hello.

237
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,198
<i>--aggression.</i>

238
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,364
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

239
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,876
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

240
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,661
<i>...if we do not confront them...</i>

241
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,876
You still have so much of our old stuff.

242
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,006
It was all here.

243
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,426
Pretty good stuff, you know?

244
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,678
I didn't see any reason to get rid of it.

245
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,386
There's stories.

246
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,972
About your family.

247
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,763
I never listened to them
when they said that...

248
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,272
...this wasn't a place that I should live.

249
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,401
You know, I looked at it,
and I just saw a little house.

250
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,818
I said, "Screw the stories,"
and I bought it.

251
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,657
Now I believe the stories.

252
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,248
You getting anything?

253
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,624
There are so many spirits,
it's hard to tell the good from the evil.

254
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,634
A lot of people died in that prison.

255
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,590
When did these occurrences start?

256
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,132
Soon after I moved in.

257
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,477
First, it was...

258
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,729
...the little things, you know?

259
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,557
Things that...

260
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,151
<i>You've been blessed with a gift.</i>

261
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,920
<i>You're special.</i>

262
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,336
<i>You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?</i>

263
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,965
<i>No. No!</i>

264
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,934
You okay?

265
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,933
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

266
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,023
These experiences you're having...

267
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,904
...where do they mainly occur?

268
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,199
Mostly in one room.

269
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,578
I keep it locked now.

270
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,536
I haven't opened it in three months.

271
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,380
I'll take that one.

272
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,708
You wanna give me a hand?

273
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,885
That's good.

274
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,798
A little bit more.

275
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,286
Sorry.

276
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,374
Can't go in there.

277
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,597
When it first started...

278
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:13,188
...I could hear somebody
just walking back and forth.

279
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,018
Someone was talking to themselves.

280
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,706
You think you're going crazy,
and then you...

281
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,163
You actually hear it.

282
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,417
And you know you're not.

283
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,716
Finally, one day, I walked in...

284
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,002
...and I screamed at it:

285
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,258
"You stop."

286
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,182
"You stop.

287
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,681
Please stop."

288
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,352
My whole life savings is in this place.

289
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,108
You gotta help me.

290
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,939
You gotta help me, please.

291
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,779
That's what we do.

292
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:10,113
The camera is so we can see
what she sees from out in the truck.

293
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,033
We call it the "Winneba-ghost."

294
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,999
I think I'm gonna go there now.

295
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,475
You really are gonna stay here all alone?

296
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:41,190
My presence tends to draw the spirits
out of their dark, little corners.

297
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,402
You need to take this.

298
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,693
Thank you.

299
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,112
Good night.

300
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,056
Can you hear us, Elise?

301
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,600
Yes. Try not to drown out
the other voices.

302
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,189
<i>We got you. We gone.</i>

303
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,109
Here you go.

304
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,400
- What's this?
- Lights.

305
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,236
Thanks.

306
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,028
I thought you were gone forever.

307
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,289
<i>My mother got this for my brother...</i>

308
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,747
...and he lost it
when he was 6 years old.

309
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,175
Safe now.

310
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,231
- Stop.
- What?

311
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,736
Go back, to the left.

312
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,530
- What?
- Yeah, nothing.

313
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,695
Thought I saw some feet.

314
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,033
Feet?

315
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,520
Elise, there's someone
right in front of you.

316
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,062
<i>Looks like a woman.</i>

317
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,775
I don't see anything.

318
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,571
<i>Elise, be careful.</i>

319
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,829
I don't see what you're seeing.

320
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,381
<i>You're going to touch it.</i>

321
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,551
Be careful.

322
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,137
Help her.

323
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,809
Elise? Elise? What happened?

324
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,557
The whistle.

325
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,772
It took the whistle.

326
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,277
What were you doing in there?

327
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,110
Thought you were gonna stay
in the bedroom.

328
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,116
Something led me down there.

329
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,118
The spirit of a woman.

330
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,623
I don't know why she said, "Help her,"
but it's a ghost I have seen before...

331
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,742
...in this house.

332
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,296
When I was 16 years old.

333
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,320
Did you hear that?

334
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,651
Hear what?

335
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,442
There's someone in the laundry room.

336
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,109
No, there isn't.

337
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,327
I heard it.

338
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,829
I'm gonna go look.

339
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,582
No. Don't, Elise.

340
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,336
Hello.

341
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,048
I live here with my brother, Christian.

342
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,714
- What's your name?
- Stop it.

343
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,758
You're making it up.

344
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,103
Come out and see my brother.
He doesn't believe that you're here.

345
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,763
Christian!

346
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,105
What are you doing, girl?

347
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,820
There's someone in the laundry.

348
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,543
There's no one in here.

349
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,833
You're doing it again.

350
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,511
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.

351
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,057
If there's one thing...

352
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,681
...you've been doing
your whole life, Elise...

353
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,099
...it's ask for it.

354
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,663
I won't let you hurt me anymore.

355
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,994
Please!

356
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,504
Elise.

357
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,173
Elise!

358
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,130
Elise, don't go!

359
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:34,810
Leave her be. Leave her be.

360
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,895
She needs to learn that nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.

361
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,448
I haven't been back here since.

362
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,794
I think that's all for tonight.

363
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,830
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

364
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,295
Christian and I came here a lot as kids.

365
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,631
Do I look okay?

366
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,516
Yeah, of course.

367
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,561
All right.

368
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,240
I'm sorry. I...

369
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,955
You just look so much
like someone I know very well.

370
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,745
Oh, really?

371
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,708
I'm Elise.

372
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,998
Melissa.

373
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,336
Imogen.

374
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,218
- And you're sisters.
- Yes, we are.

375
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,004
Tucker.

376
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,717
Specs.

377
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,258
I'm Specs. Or Steven.

378
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,676
Whatever. Your choice.

379
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,016
She's psychic, and we're sidekick.

380
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,930
I'm sorry?

381
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,607
Forget it.

382
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,565
- So are you guys visiting the area?
- Tough to talk about.

383
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,606
Actually, it's pretty <i>confidencial.</i>

384
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,571
It's a poltergeist infestation
involving Ted Garza.

385
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,282
Do you know him?
He lives, like, down the road or...?

386
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,914
Ghosts and ghouls.

387
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,245
What he's trying to say
is we're ghost hunters.

388
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,126
The three of us.

389
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
Kind of like cops.

390
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,997
Only we don't arrest humans.

391
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,755
I'm funny too. A lot of the time.

392
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,966
- I can also be funny. What?
- Okay. Okay.

393
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,301
- I think that that's enough, boys.
- Oh, yeah?

394
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,222
I used to live in this town
a long time ago.

395
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,603
Well, good for you. You got out.

396
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,642
I'm really making a fool out of myself.
We're making...

397
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,309
No, you're not.

398
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,105
It's really nice to meet you.

399
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,990
- Ernie, how's it hanging?
- Dad, over here.

400
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,738
- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?

401
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,960
Hello, Christian.

402
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,083
Have I aged that much?

403
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,099
Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

404
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,804
I have nothing to say to you.

405
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,344
Girls, come on. Let's go.

406
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,808
- Come on.
- We just got here.

407
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,893
Hear me out.

408
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm... I'm still your sister, and...

409
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,109
That only means something if I choose it
to mean something, and I choose it not to.

410
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,738
Please, Christian.

411
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,118
I just want you to hear my piece.
I didn't know how this was gonna go.

412
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,075
- I thought you could see the future.
- Is this your sister?

413
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,707
- No, it isn't! Come on.
- Yes, yes, I am his sister.

414
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,241
Listen to me. You listen.

415
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,630
Now, when we were children,
you terrified me.

416
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,461
You scared the life out of me...

417
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,468
...with stories about a monster
behind a red door...

418
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,551
...and then you opened the door
and you left.

419
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,307
You left me.

420
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,685
You abandoned me to a real monster,
our father.

421
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:09,232
Look, I wish you no harm,
but you stay away from us, Elise.

422
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,109
You stay away.

423
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,770
Christian.

424
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,619
Christian!

425
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,337
I was stupid to come back here.

426
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,501
No, you weren't. You're helping people.

427
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,511
That's what you do, remember?

428
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,388
Elise.

429
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,299
I'm sorry.

430
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,014
He can be unreasonable sometimes.

431
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,772
Knowing what he grew up with,
that's perfectly understandable.

432
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,273
He's never told us anything
about his childhood.

433
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,485
I've never even seen a picture.

434
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,646
He never told us anything about you.

435
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,948
I left him alone, and I shouldn't have.

436
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,954
He is a great dad, you know?

437
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,831
I love him a lot.

438
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,164
You have no idea how happy
that makes me, honey.

439
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,666
- Tucker?
- Share with me. Yes?

440
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,960
Do you have the still frames
that we printed?

441
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,924
- Yes, I do.
- Bring them here.

442
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,262
- Eaten by the female, that's why I don't...
- Tucker?

443
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,267
- Tucker, I need you.
- Yes.

444
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,261
Come on.

445
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,944
Here you go.

446
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:40,233
Here. You give this to your dad...

447
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,743
...and you tell him it was taken yesterday
in our old bedroom.

448
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,996
Oh, I think he will be
very surprised to see it.

449
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,459
I'm so happy to meet you.

450
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,253
Okay.

451
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,014
Testing. One, two.

452
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,054
Can you hear me, guys?

453
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,941
- No.
- I noticed this last night...

454
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,902
...but I couldn't quite place it.

455
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,610
Then Christian reminded me
that when I was a child...

456
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,276
...I saw a red door.

457
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:28,037
The entity that killed my mother
came through it.

458
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,162
I don't get it. A red door is a red door.
Anyone can see it.

459
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,579
No, it's not a literal door.
It's a metaphysical one.

460
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,125
Remember when I went into The Further
to find Quinn Brenner?

461
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,419
I came across a red door.

462
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:49,177
<i>And I... I passed through it,
and it took me deeper into The Further.</i>

463
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,845
If I can find out what it means...

464
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,726
...I might be able to stop the thing
that's haunting this house.

465
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,145
Well, this might help.

466
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,368
I spoke to you last night.

467
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,748
Are you there? Can you hear me?

468
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,923
You took something from me.

469
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,713
Why?

470
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,932
<i>Why did you say, "Help her"?</i>

471
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,433
<i>Help who?</i>

472
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,347
This way.

473
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,966
Is that you?

474
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,589
Whistle once for yes, twice for no.

475
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,850
Are you the woman I saw last night?

476
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,855
Is there an entity in this house...

477
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,895
...that is trying to hurt Ted Garza?

478
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,617
Are you that entity?

479
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,086
Is there something
you're trying to show me?

480
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,544
Is what you want to show me...

481
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,962
...behind this wall?

482
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,055
Keys.

483
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:51,065
Freeze, buddy. Freeze.

484
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,445
On.

485
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,027
Wait. On.

486
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,839
Wait.

487
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,432
Thank you.

488
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,838
What is it you wanna show me?

489
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,968
Help her!

490
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,198
Help me.

491
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,464
That's not a ghost.

492
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,966
Oh, my God.

493
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,512
Oh, my God.

494
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,173
I'll break the chain.

495
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,637
No, you won't.

496
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,228
Move.

497
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,892
Get away from her!

498
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,810
I asked you, help me get rid of the ghost.

499
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,773
Help me get rid of it!

500
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,655
<i>Help me!</i>

501
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,152
Why did you have to come down here?

502
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,957
- Why?!
- Your ghost led us down here.

503
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,368
He's in my head.

504
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,754
He's in my head.

505
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,271
Is that your friend?

506
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,728
That is your friend.

507
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,994
You there, Specs?

508
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,882
Specs!

509
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,173
What?

510
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,790
Her name is Mara Jennings.

511
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,797
She's a nurse from a town
about 10 miles outside of here.

512
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,334
She's been missing
for approximately four months.

513
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,094
Watch your step down.

514
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,768
- Can you stick around for a few days?
- Yeah, we'll be here.

515
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,305
I'm gonna have to get statements
from all of you.

516
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,780
There are plenty of demons in this world
who are very much alive...

517
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,616
...and you stopped one of them.

518
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,330
Thanks, Elise.

519
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,246
Dad, this is crazy.

520
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,040
This is something I have to do.

521
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:00,849
<i>I gotta find it.</i>

522
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:04,808
It's a little whistle,
a little silver whistle.

523
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:08,771
Look, I deal in the spirit world...

524
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:13,859
...and spirits can make people
do bad things in the real world.

525
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,650
Some of these people come to me
for help.

526
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,319
But to you, that's weird.

527
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,330
To me, it's a day job.

528
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,544
This one was different though.

529
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:33,124
The haunted house was my house.

530
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,715
It's not in here.

531
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,886
Hey, I'm gonna check on him.

532
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:44,385
Why would Garza invite you up...

533
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,931
...knowing the risk
that you might discover Mara?

534
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:58,073
These hauntings can be terrifying things.

535
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:02,195
Maybe the fear of the beyond...

536
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,740
...overcame the fear of getting caught.

537
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,034
Or maybe he wanted to get caught.

538
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,256
What? What is it?

539
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,217
I'm sorry.

540
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,095
I'm seeing things.

541
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,806
The shock of the whole thing, I suppose.

542
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,013
Do you need me for anything else?

543
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,518
No.

544
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,178
Thank you.

545
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,981
Melissa?

546
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,696
Dad?

547
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,862
Down here, honey. I found the whistle.

548
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,636
Dad?

549
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,624
- What are you doing here?
- You can't find her, can you?

550
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:42,460
What happened to her? Where is she?

551
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,716
- We've looked everywhere.
- Not everywhere.

552
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,107
Oh, God, no.

553
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,737
Imogen, call an ambulance.

554
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,401
Now!

555
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,836
How did you know where she was?

556
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,596
What happened to her?

557
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:35,013
There's something evil in that house...

558
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,018
...and I let it into this world.

559
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,429
I think it made Ted Garza do
what he did...

560
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,565
...and it's taken your sister's spirit,
and I'm gonna find it...

561
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,602
...and I'm gonna finish it tonight.

562
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,696
I can see things too.

563
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,960
When I was a little girl...

564
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,253
...I went to sleep
and floated out of my bedroom...

565
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,210
...all the way
to our elderly neighbor's house.

566
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:13,426
Then she told me she was leaving
this world and going on to the next.

567
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,059
My dad told me
she had died the night before.

568
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,686
I told him I already knew.

569
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,482
- He wasn't too happy to hear that.
- Imogen, let's go.

570
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,858
Come on, honey.

571
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,737
No, I... I'm staying.

572
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,861
Just trust me, okay?

573
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:38,155
Come on, boys, let's get our things
and get in the house and get started.

574
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,741
Son of a...

575
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,964
I am going to get the attention
of all the spirits in this house.

576
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,216
I need things
that were important to Garza.

577
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,378
Specs, go upstairs.

578
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,013
There is a Bible he held very dear to him.

579
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:59,142
It was a red King James version,
and I need you to find it.

580
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,178
- Take Imogen with you.
- Okay.

581
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,438
- Do not let her out of your sight.
- I won't.

582
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,434
Tucker and I are going down
to the fallout shelter.

583
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,820
I get the death chamber,
he gets Bible camp with a beautiful girl?

584
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,104
That's not a democracy.

585
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,400
You're the only one I trust
to go down there with me.

586
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,532
Don't patronize me, woman.

587
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,453
So why do you guys dress like that?

588
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:26,336
It was Elise's idea. She dressed us.

589
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:31,250
No, my usual style's a lot more laid back.

590
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,918
It's a little weird.

591
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,588
- What?
- Dude.

592
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,552
This is vintage. No, this is worth a lot.

593
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,471
I'm serious. We gotta find this thing.

594
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,980
I'm just saying.

595
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,858
- Gotta have hobbies.
- I'm saying.

596
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:52,021
Can't all be work. Gotta enjoy yourself,
go out on a date.

597
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,071
You gotta do stuff like that.

598
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:58,735
There's something here.

599
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,281
I can feel it.

600
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,661
She wants me to have it.

601
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,839
Oh, that should do it.

602
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,172
- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.

603
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,510
It's time to sleep.

604
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,395
I know this slip.

605
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,235
- This will help you sleep.
- Don't make me drink anymore.

606
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,867
Please, let me go. I beg you.

607
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:22,782
There you go.

608
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,411
Please, let me go.

609
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,167
I promise I won't tell.

610
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,544
Please, let me...

611
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,119
Did you hear that?

612
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,201
Hear what?

613
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,792
- My brother doesn't believe you're here.
- Christian!

614
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,342
There's someone in the laundry.

615
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,855
There's no one here.

616
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,606
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it.

617
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,500
Goodbye, Anna.

618
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,553
She wasn't dead.

619
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,472
My father did the exact same thing
that Garza did.

620
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:17,309
The woman I saw in this house
all those years ago...

621
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,270
...she was alive.

622
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,984
I could have helped her.

623
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,662
I let him kill her.

624
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:35,266
Take this thing off.

625
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,597
Okay.

626
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,007
Her death was my fault.

627
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:10,180
Until I free her from
wherever he put her...

628
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:13,179
...she's trapped in the dark.

629
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,977
Lost.

630
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:18,183
I'm going in there.

631
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,723
Stand back.

632
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,406
Go for it.

633
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,192
I'm good.

634
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,503
I'm sorry, Anna.

635
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,207
I failed you.

636
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:18,554
Oh, my God.

637
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:26,899
Where you going?

638
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,734
Elise.

639
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,062
Elise.

640
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,167
Elise.

641
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,802
You weren't the only one, Anna.

642
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,142
- Audrey!
- Elise?

643
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,101
<i>Audrey.</i>

644
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,107
<i>Audrey.</i>

645
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,860
Elise.

646
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,358
Where am I?

647
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,449
You're in a special place...

648
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,993
...where the spirits go.

649
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:43,995
Who are you?

650
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,955
I'm a friend.

651
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:51,665
I don't wanna be here.

652
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,796
I don't wanna go where the spirits go.

653
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,302
Elise...

654
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,140
...no matter what your daddy says...

655
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:07,644
...you have to go on doing what you do.

656
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,898
Never be afraid of your ability.

657
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,819
Daddy doesn't mean it
when he yells at me.

658
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,941
He's scared...

659
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,696
...of the man with the keys.

660
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,535
He's the one controlling it all.

661
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,451
He's the one who opens all the doors.

662
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:39,004
- He opens all the red doors?
- Yes.

663
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,216
The man with the keys said
I'm more powerful than I know.

664
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,926
He says he wants me
to help him open every door.

665
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,593
He says he'll do anything it takes
to get me.

666
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,104
He's standing right behind you.

667
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,141
<i>No!</i>

668
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,107
Leave this place!

669
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,074
Elise, wake up.

670
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,618
Elise!

671
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,204
Specs!

672
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,082
I need help!

673
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:18,915
Here, here. Careful with her head.

674
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,761
- She's on the other side.
- Somebody has to go in.

675
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,680
Yeah, who's gonna do that?
I can't do that. Can you do that?

676
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,215
- I didn't say...
- I can do it.

677
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,594
I can help her.

678
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:35,356
I've never actually hypnotized
anybody before.

679
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,312
I've never been hypnotized.

680
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,978
Well, then you won't know
what I'm doing wrong, right?

681
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,401
Okay.

682
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,119
The exercise, it's a little...
I'm gonna... I'll put my finger there.

683
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,704
E.T.

684
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,745
Imogen.

685
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,208
That's pretty cool.

686
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,589
Just look here.

687
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,752
And concentrate on it and just relax.

688
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:08,511
Imagine that your body is made of water
and you're in the ocean.

689
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,345
That doesn't make sense.

690
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,847
- What?
- She's made of water...

691
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:16,310
...and she's in the ocean.
Therefore, she is the ocean.

692
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,816
Would you like to do this?

693
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:26,157
- Thank you.
<i>- I'll</i> still be here.

694
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,409
- Don't touch the subject.
- I'm not.

695
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,286
Move away.

696
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,012
Close your eyes.

697
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,972
Listen to the ticking.

698
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,056
Focus on it.

699
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,181
I'm going to count back from five.

700
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:03,445
By the time I reach one,
you will be hypnotized.

701
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,526
Five, four...

702
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:12,119
...three, two, one.

703
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,872
Nod if you can hear me.

704
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:23,085
When I say "now,"
you will open your eyes...

705
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:26,968
...and you will be on the other side.

706
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,515
<i>Now.</i>

707
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,832
Wanna go there.

708
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,397
I'll help you.

709
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,392
Red door.

710
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,061
Red door.

711
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,822
That's the red door
Elise was talking about.

712
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,110
This is the place.

713
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,146
I can't go in there.

714
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,557
If he finds me, he'll...

715
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,398
He'll take me again.

716
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,780
Trust me. You'll find
what you're looking for in there.

717
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,739
<i>I admit it!</i>

718
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,495
<i>Shut up!</i>

719
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,532
<i>That's right!</i>

720
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,209
Elise?

721
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,543
<i>The key is missing.</i>

722
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,588
<i>You're all gonna get it again!</i>

723
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:36,525
<i>Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?</i>

724
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,950
<i>Sometimes.</i>

725
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,704
<i>Do you wonder where they go?</i>

726
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,578
<i>Your turn now.</i>

727
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,370
<i>Look out, little girl!</i>

728
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,868
<i>--always repeats, my friends.
The ghosts of their past...</i>

729
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,491
<i>--if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

730
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:30,680
<i>If there's one thing you've been doing
your whole life, Elise, it's ask for it.</i>

731
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,724
No! No, Daddy!

732
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,735
<i>They're all around us in this house.</i>

733
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,236
<i>Everywhere.</i>

734
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:44,614
<i>She needs to learn nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.</i>

735
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:47,075
Stop, Daddy, stop.

736
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,958
<i>- No, Daddy, please.</i>
- Please, stop. No.

737
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,789
- Stop.
<i>- No. No.</i>

738
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:55,045
<i>No, Daddy!</i>

739
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,610
<i>Some people are afraid
of special people.</i>

740
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:59,875
<i>Your daddy is one of them.</i>

741
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,216
<i>I won't let you hurt me anymore.</i>

742
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,937
<i>Did you see a ghost?</i>

743
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,356
<i>Just say no. That's all you have to do.</i>

744
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:25,947
<i>You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.</i>

745
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:30,243
You killed your mother.

746
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,634
Elise.

747
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,388
Elise!

748
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,106
Elise!

749
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,566
He's in my head. He's in my head.

750
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,655
<i>My father did the exact same thing
as Garza.</i>

751
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:09,529
My father was your puppet.

752
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:15,160
I am not gonna feed you
with hatred anymore, demon.

753
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:16,668
You can fucking starve.

754
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,331
Elise!

755
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,207
No!

756
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:30,262
Leave her alone!
You wanna take somebody, take me.

757
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,579
Let them go.

758
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:55,954
<i>See now?</i>

759
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,633
Honey? Honey?

760
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:11,094
Nurse! Nurse, get in here!

761
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,892
Melissa!

762
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:23,268
It's okay, it's okay.

763
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,522
One, two, three, four.

764
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,497
I'm sorry.

765
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:46,876
No! No!

766
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:52,840
No!

767
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:14,236
Elise!

768
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,123
Hands off my little girl.

769
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:45,498
No, no, no.

770
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:47,413
Elise!

771
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,332
She's hurt

772
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,961
Return to your body. Go.

773
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,516
Baby.

774
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:43,803
Oh, Dad.

775
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,392
Elise, she saved me.

776
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,959
I don't know the words.

777
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,594
I already know, my love.

778
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:27,308
Keep helping people.

779
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,617
Go home.

780
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,428
Imogen, wake up!

781
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:02,764
Are you okay?

782
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,174
Yeah, I think so.

783
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:10,223
You can't get rid of me that easy.
The hospital.

784
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:19,607
<i>Nurse needed in ICU stat.</i>

785
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:23,819
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

786
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,112
Hi.

787
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,826
I'm okay.

788
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,287
Oh, my God.

789
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:31,243
Hi.

790
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:48,560
I believe this is yours.

791
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:56,769
You were right, Christian.

792
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,482
I'm cursed.

793
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:01,398
Demons follow me around.

794
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:07,621
But I don't want to give them
what they want for one second longer.

795
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:10,829
Fear and pain is what feeds them.

796
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:14,670
I'm the one that's been feeding them...

797
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:17,331
...shutting you out all these years.

798
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,834
You forgive me?

799
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:22,127
I never should have left you.

800
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:31,394
Thank you.

801
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,689
Yes.

802
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,985
Melissa...

803
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,991
...you gonna eat that?

804
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:47,868
Go for it.

805
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:55,958
You know, I always thought
that I was afraid of dying...

806
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:59,794
...but now I realize that I wasn't.

807
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,675
I was afraid of dying...

808
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:06,089
...before I truly had a family again.

809
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:09,558
Now I do.

810
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:11,680
Son of a...

811
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:13,845
I told you not to park there.

812
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,856
- Just saying, I did.
- Listen to your buddy.

813
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:20,186
He gets the girl, I get the ticket?

814
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:22,987
I'm riding shotgun.

815
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:26,025
We'll have to come back here
to deal with that ticket.

816
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,199
Dalton.

817
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:15,957
Today was just so horrible.
I'm scared nothing's gonna change.

818
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,458
It will.

819
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:19,753
I promise you.

820
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,331
<i>Just gotta give it time.</i>

821
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:45,024
Oh, Dalton.

822
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:00,539
Hello.

823
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:04,377
<i>I'm so sorry for calling so late.
My name ls Lorraine.</i>

824
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:08,714
<i>You helped my family a long time ago
when my son was just a boy.</i>

825
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:11,801
<i>And now the same thing is happening
to my grandson.</i>

826
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:13,557
Dalton.

827
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,342
<i>How did you know his name?</i>

828
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:18,387
It's what I do.

829
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,687
Tell Josh I'll be there in the morning.

830
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,601
<i>Thank you.</i>

831
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,521
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>
