- Here's yours.
- Aw.

16
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:15,810
I forgot about it till now.

00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:16,978

00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:20,682
- Yes.
- I don't think it's gonna be as good as...

00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:21,983
Wait, where's Lindsay?

21
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:24,252
Um, I think I saw her
at the library earlier.

22
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,956
Oh, my God.
Those are so cute.

23
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,724
That's right,
'cause you can't forget them.

00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:31,128
Teri?

25
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,034
Hey, Oona. What's up?

26
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:41,769
Hey, where are you?

27
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:43,472
I'm heading to the lot.

28
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:44,739
Wait, you're not coming back?

29
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,308
I told my grandma I'd be home
for breakfast in the morning.

30
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,310
But I was your secret Santa,

31
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:51,846
and I got the perfect
Lindsay gift.

32
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:54,282
- Guess what it is.
- I don't know. What?

33
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:56,017
Lindsay. Think.

34
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,021
Perfect gift.

35
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,189
Oh, my God.

36
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:03,057
You told me yours disappeared.

37
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,059
And every girl needs
a little self-care.

38
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,495
Now you'll never need a man.

39
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:09,063
Well, at least I got something

40
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,199
to look forward to next semester.

41
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,202
Love you, Lindsay.
Have a great break.

42
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:15,870
Love you, too.

43
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,831

Riley.

75
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:12,568
What the heck?

76
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,303

Where did you find that?

80
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:22,478
Kris sent it to me.

81
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,614
She, um, said that watching
the woman who inspired our song

82
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,382
would inspire me.

83
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,418
But it just made me realize
I'm the B-team.

84
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,520
"B" as in "brilliant"?

85
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:34,255
Or "bodacious"
or "breathtaking" or...

86
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:35,457
I'm running out of "B" s.

87
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:36,625
Uh, yeah, no.

88
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:39,060
Uh, barely able
to keep it together

89
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:40,662
because I'm so nervous?

90
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,263
The day of that performance,

91
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,132
I totally lost my voice
and I couldn't sing.

92
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,502
- What did you do?
- I was doing everything.

93
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,403
I was gargling salt water,
I was drinking tea,

94
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:51,573
I was rubbing peppermint oil
all over my body, but...

95
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:55,209
my big sister Becks
gave me this.

96
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,345
It's been passed down
from Mu to Mu for generations,

97
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:01,450
and it's meant to give
whatever sister has it courage.

98
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:03,117
I swear to God,
the second I put it

99
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,686
in my hair, my voice came back.

100
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:05,687
- Whoa.
- Calories, please.

101
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,221
I'm glad to know I'm not

102
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:08,291
the only one who gets nervous.

103
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,060
Here.

104
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:15,664
Wait, are you...
are you giving this to me?

105
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,365
Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,133
As your designated big sister,

107
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,869
it's my job
to take care of you.

108
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,270
That's what I'm gonna do.

109
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,272
Wow. Thank you.

110
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,711
Hey, Mom.

111
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:31,212
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.

112
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:33,114
I know I said
I'd call you back,

113
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,384
but it's only been 15 minutes.

114
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:36,654
Hey, Ri.

115
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:40,187
I gave you that comb.

116
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,591

117
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:45,494
Here, the dress
I borrowed from you,

118
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:48,697
all nice, clean, ready for
the orphans' dinner tomorrow.

119
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,465
Hold on.

120
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:53,435
Is it bad we're calling it
"orphans' dinner,"

121
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,703
since you're a...

122
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:57,073
Wait, my parents are dead?

123
00:09:57,908 --> 00:09:59,173
I...

124
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:00,475
I'm kidding.

125
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:02,544
You can totally call it
the "orphans' dinner."

126
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,178
Oh.

127
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,647
Okay, good, 'cause I thought
it sounded cute,

128
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,382
like Dickensian or something.

129
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,283
Where do you want me
to put this?

130
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,386
Oh, you can keep it.
I never wear it anymore.

131
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:13,722
Christmas is the time
for looking sexy, Riley.

132
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:15,222
I thought that was Halloween.

133
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,324
Technically,
it's every holiday.

134
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,393
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Um, can someone figure out

135
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,360
how to turn that thing off?

136
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:21,730
It, like, woke me up
at 4:00 in the morning.

137
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:22,931
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Thank you.

138
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:26,501
I'll leave it here for you
for when you change your mind.

139
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:28,570
- I won't.
- You will.

140
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:30,204
I won't.

141
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,640
Bye. Have a good break.

142
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:33,642
- Grab the duffel.
- Bye, Riley.

143
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,817
After break, man.

144
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,419
It's in the Myers building.

145
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:36,638
"Men, bonding together,

146
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,308
"invented culture as a defense
against female nature.

147
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,812
"Sky-cult was
the most sophisticated step

148
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:46,581
"in this process,

149
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,283
"of the creative locus

150
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:53,424
"is a shift from belly magic
to head magic.

151
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,792
"And from this
defensive head magic

152
00:11:56,794 --> 00:12:01,328
"has come the spectacular glory
of male civilization,

153
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,232
"which has lifted woman with it.

154
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,333
"The very language and logic

155
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:09,404
"modern woman uses

were the invention of men."

157
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,042
Now, who here can tell me

158
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:17,213
what they think this writer
is trying to suggest?

159
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,552
Miss Stone.

160
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:26,755
U-Um...

161
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:30,759
I think that he's saying

162
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:34,496
that women think
with their instincts

163
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:38,500
and men think
with their brains,

164
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:42,871
and that women
live in men's worlds

165
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:44,806
whether they like it or not.

166
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:46,675
You said "he."

167
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:49,511
What makes you think
the author is a man?

168
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:50,912
I...

169
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:56,451
It may surprise you to know
that the writer is one

170
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:59,389
Dr. Camille...

171
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,458
...Paglia.

172
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,863
Now, I just wanted to show you
that there is no way of writing

173
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:10,766
that is inherently
male or female.

174
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:14,770
And it's very difficult
for me to do my job,

175
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:18,372
teaching the curriculum,
which does happen to contain

176
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:20,675
many white male writers,

177
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:26,548
when there's a petition
circulating to have me fired.

178
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,386
I have no nefarious plot to
secret away knowledge from you.

179
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,922
There are no "covert meetings"
in hidden rooms

180
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:35,757
where men discuss
how to bury women.

181
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,127
You, or more likely
your parents,

182
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:41,696
are paying a great deal of money

183
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,765
for you to study
the proper classics.

184
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:46,804
And it's my job
to present them to you.

185
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,604
Enjoy your winter breaks.

186
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:52,574
And a Merry Christmas
to you all.

187
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:57,145
Hi there. Do you want
to sign my petition against

188
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:58,713
Professor Gelson
and the ruthless misogyny

189
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,715
of higher education...

190
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,884
Hi. Um, do you want
to sign my petition?

191
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:04,519
- Uh, sure.
- It's against Professor Gelson.

192
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:05,787
I don't know.

193
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:08,657
I just don't really feel like
dealing with my mom right now.

194
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,458
She's just...

195
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,762
It doesn't surprise me at all
that my dad left her.

196
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:16,598
Anyways, I'm excited to spend
the break with you guys.

197
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,869
A little less excited for the
dance tonight at DKO, but...

198
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:23,605
Are you sure you're cool
with us doing it?

199
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,540
...higher education. Hi!

200
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,708
Gelson's going down!

201
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,443
Would you like to sign my...
Okay.

202
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:29,845
50 signatures and counting,

203
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,746
and this is the beginning
of winter break,

204
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,748
when traditionally
no one cares about anything.

205
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,984
You already got the college
to remove the founder's bust

206
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:37,786
from the
administration building.

207
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,755
Isn't that enough crusading
for one semester, Kris?

208
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:42,190
- Uh, no.
- Oh.

209
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:43,959
Calvin Hawthorne was
a racist and a sexist.

210
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,761
He owned slaves.
In the North.

211
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:49,464
Seriously. He was into
the dark arts and shit.

212
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,633
I read he, like,
killed disobedient women

213
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:53,835
in ritual sacrifices
to male pagan gods.

214
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:56,638
Oh, my God, Kris.
You actually believe that?

215
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
And it's not like they
destroyed the freakin' thing.

216
00:14:58,642 --> 00:14:59,941
The Dekes took it to their frat,

217
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:01,710
and now they can
junk off onto it

218
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:02,944
and no one has to see it.

219
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,913
Everyone wins.

220
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:08,650
- Where are you going?
- Work.

221
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:10,018
Ooh, cool.
I need coffee.

222
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,693
I still don't understand

223
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:20,662
why you want to get him
fired so bad.

224
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:22,530
Uh, 'cause he went
totally crazy on me

225
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:25,467
when all I did was ask why his
syllabus has no women on it,

226
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:27,035
queer people on it,
trans people on it,

227
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:29,671
- people of color on it.
- Yeah, but, uh, I mean,

228
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:32,040
are we just supposed
to not study the classics?

229
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,678
Whose classics are they?
'Cause they're not mine.

230
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:38,747
Will you at least
sign my petition?

231
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:39,981
You of all people should care.

232
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:43,551
What happened to Riley is a
completely different thing than

233
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:45,687
- what happened to you, Kris.
- I am just saying

234
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,055
that she might want
to get involved because

235
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,957
she understands that
if we let men get away with

236
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,892
- this sort of behavior...
- "She" is right here, you guys.

237
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:53,261
Let men get away
with this sort of behavior,

238
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,829
then they'll get away
with everything.

239
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,964
They already do.

240
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:57,832
I thought we were sisters.

241
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,869
No? Fine. I get it.

242
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:03,738
You guys don't want to fight
the good fight.

243
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,840
You don't want to confront
the white supremacist

244
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,509
- patriarchy head-on.
- Kris, come on.

245
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,077
- Split a snickerdoodle with me?
- No, no. Nope.

246
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,912
It's fine. I get it.

247
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:12,681
I'll sign it.

248
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,049
Excuse me?

249
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,017
Yeah. I mean,
I-I thought it was cool

250
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,287
that you got them to get rid
of Calvin Hawthorne's bust.

251
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,822
It was kind of creepy.

252
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:23,124
Uh, and the way

253
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:25,996
Professor Gelson yelled at you
in class was really lame.

254
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:29,631
Sorry for the wait.

255
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:31,902
No worries.
I... I don't mind waiting.

256
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:37,906
Sorry. That was really...

257
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:38,909
Thank you.

258
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
Okay, fine.
Give it to me.

259
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:46,014
Thank you.
And you know what?

260
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,618
I would love to split
a snickerdoodle with you.

261
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,621
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Excuse me.

262
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:54,656
Sorry.

263
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,157
- Oh. After you.
- Thank you.

264
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,993
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:59,963
Yeah.

266
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:09,904
Oh, you can take this back.

267
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:10,907
Oh, no.

268
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:13,808
What's up, ladies?

269
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,012
Can I get an iced coffee?

270
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Excited for tonight?

271
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:20,181
Brian's gonna be there.

272
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:22,917
He's coming up from D.C.
to meet the new pledges.

273
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,652
The only place
Brian Huntley belongs

274
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,656
is in jail
for what he did to Riley.

275
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:29,924
We're going skiing together.

276
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:32,062
Don't worry.
It's consensual.

277
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:35,163
Screw you, Phil.

278
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:38,135
And tell Brian to stay
the hell away from Riley.

279
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:40,804
Keep the change.

280
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:45,173
What should we do?

281
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:48,076
We could pull out,
be conscientious objectors like

282
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:49,677
Lindsay and the Delta Sig girls

283
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,380
and skip the performance
altogether.

284
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:53,114
You've been trying to get
out of this for three weeks.

285
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:54,383
Come on, we're not bailing.

286
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,718
- I'll be fine.
- Are you sure?

287
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,154
It was three years ago.
I can handle it.

288
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:01,158
What's the worst
that can happen?

289
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,112
Do women say the word "dump"?

290
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,181
I mean, uh, yeah.

291
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:29,884
I hate these little cutie names
for just taking a shit.

292
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,920
I don't think
we say cutie names, do we?

293
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,721
Is he here?
Did you see him?

294
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:34,989
I mean, there's
definitely a difference.

295
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,057
I don't know.

296
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,226
That's okay.
That's okay.

297
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:40,028
- You guys look so hot.
- Smoosh, can you

298
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,097
- take a photo of all of us?
- Of course.

299
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:44,067
That's what I'm here for.

300
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:48,036
Ooh.

301
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,038
Oh, daddy.

302
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,206
What are you doing?
Come on.

303
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,074
Yeah.

304
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:55,110
Whoo. Mm-mmm.

305
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,111
You ready?

306
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,046
Three, two, one.

307
00:18:58,048 --> 00:18:59,781
Cheese.

308
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:02,117
- Got it.
- I'm glad I wore my push-up bra.

309
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,453
Yeah, okay.

310
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,455
My little documentarian.

311
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:07,755
I love you so much, baby.

312
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,057
Where's Helena?

313
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,758
Oh, she was pounding
vodka sodas earlier,

314
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,026
but she looked really good.

315
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:13,895
Are you okay, Smoosh?

316
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,464
Yeah. It's just
an allergy headache. I'm fine.

317
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:17,765
Seriously, if she screws
this up, I'm gonna kill her.

318
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:18,933
Says the girl
who projectile vomited

319
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:20,935
at Sophomore Salad Soiree.

320
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:22,837
I'm gonna go look for her.

321
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,107
- "Woman."
- "Woman," sorry, who projectile vomited

322
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:28,076
at Sophomore Salad Soiree.

323
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:19,095
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

324
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:23,133
The founder wills it so.

325
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,842
Watch it, pledge.
Break that, and it's all over.

326
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:37,178
You'll never be
part of the Deke army.

327
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,181
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

328
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:42,984
The power of the founder
compels you

329
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:46,354
to pledge your loyalty to DKO.

330
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:48,856
The founder wills it so.

331
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:02,870
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

332
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:05,875
The power
of the founder compels you.

333
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,162
No, stop.

334
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:40,442
You are so sexy.

335
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:42,812
- I want you so bad.
- Wait.

336
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:47,317
Wait. Wait.

337
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:51,620
Wait.
Phil, wait. Wait.

338
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:53,921
- Helena?
- Dude, what the hell?

339
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:56,057
I've been looking for you.

340
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,126
Right, you found her,
so get the hell out.

341
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:00,328
The girls want to practice
dance one more time.

342
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,298
I-I guess, I guess
I got to, I got to...

343
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,968
We were in the middle
of something.

344
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:07,837
Do you want me to leave?

345
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,477
You bitches are all the same.

346
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:18,815
You act like you want it, but
you're all a bunch of teases.

347
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:24,386
You know, Brian would never
have done what you said he did.

348
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,063
You okay?

349
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,465
I don't feel...

350
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:40,902
Does vodka mix well
with tequila?

351
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:43,237
Yeah, get it all out.

352
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:50,244
Well, that'll be a really nice
Christmas gift for him.

353
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:58,387
I am such an idiot.

354
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,390
You're not an idiot.

355
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:03,427
I just thought he was cute.

356
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:07,261
Should I take you home?

357
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:09,997
No.

358
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:12,367
No, you stay here.

359
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:14,904
You can let the girls down
easy for me.

360
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:18,139
Will you promise
you're gonna text me

361
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:19,309
as soon as you get home?

362
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:25,012
Promise.

363
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:27,014
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- All right.

364
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:28,450
Oh, daddy.

365
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,419
Where is she?

366
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:32,554
- I put her in an Uber.
- Is she okay?

367
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:34,290
She's fine.
She just ate something bad.

368
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:38,025
What? She did.

369
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:40,027
Maybe it's a sign
we shouldn't sing.

370
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:41,197
Ow.

371
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:46,134
No. Absolutely not.

372
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:48,136
Are you kidding me?

373
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:49,738
You've been coaching us
for three weeks,

374
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,240
you know the choreography,
and you sing.

375
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:53,409
Yeah, but he's here.

376
00:23:53,411 --> 00:23:55,345
It's all the more reason
to do it.

377
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,515
Jesse, what do you think?

378
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,285
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
What am I supposed to say?

379
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:06,154
This way of life
is unsustainable, Riley.

380
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:08,990
What Brian did to you...
it's awful.

381
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:11,225
And it's terrible
that nobody believed you.

382
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:14,262
But you can't just sit on
the sidelines alone forever.

383
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:16,398
You're gonna keep
shrinking and shrinking

384
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,366
until there's
nothing left of you.

385
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:19,367
Hmm?

386
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,071
You used to be a fighter.

387
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:24,974
It's time to be a fighter again.

388
00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:31,380
If not for yourself,
for your sisters?

389
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:38,554

not to rape another girl.

424
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:55,189
Come on! Hey!

425
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:56,458
Let's go!

426
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,159
Let's leave. Let's go.

427
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,929
Just keep going.

428
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,531
Look what I got!

429
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:04,499
I can't believe
I just fucking did that!

430
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,602
Baby Jesus is
smiling down on you, Riley,

431
00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:08,537
and he wants to thank you
for such a good birthday.

432
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,605
- Did you see their faces?
- I was ready... I know.

433
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:11,573
I was ready to pee myself.
I wasn't even onstage.

434
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,742
- Oh, my God. - I had no idea...
- Riley!

435
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,477
It's the North Pole's
best kept secret.

436
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,545
Oh, really?

437
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:18,380
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, uh...

438
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:21,315
- it's Riley, right?
- Yeah.

439
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:23,652
Um, that was really good.

440
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:25,186
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

441
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:26,388
Uh, I was really impressed.

442
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,157
That-that takes guts.

443
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:32,761
Uh, I'm Landon.

444
00:27:32,763 --> 00:27:35,464
Hey, guys, come on.

445
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:37,298
Cake. Let's go sneak
into the café.

446
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
- Come on.
- No. I should probably go home.

447
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:41,603
- No. It is midnight on our last day...
- I...

448
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:44,271
...of our last fall semester
of college ever.

449
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:45,807
You're not bailing.
Come on. Live a little.

450
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:48,275
Do you want to come with us?

451
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:50,479
Uh... nah, I got to...

452
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:52,681
Yeah. I-I'm-I'm probably
gonna go home any...

453
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:54,348
Why am I telling you that?

454
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,685
- Like, okay.
- Ugh.

455
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:58,252
Hey, you know what?

456
00:27:58,254 --> 00:28:01,322
Actually,
screw those Dekes, man.

457
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:02,457
They suck.

458
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,459
- Uh, they can return the equipment.
- Okay, well, let me

459
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:05,326
just text my friend Helena,

460
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:06,461
- make sure she got home okay.
- Okay.

461
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:08,295
Mm, she already sent
a group text to all of us.

462
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:10,799
Says, "How is swiff.

463
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:13,300
"Traking the ampersant
30 train tom.

464
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:15,302
See you next yeat!"

465
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:17,472
- So, I think we're all good.
- All right. Let's go.

466
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:18,540
Yay!

467
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:20,341
Landon, you can hold this.

468
00:28:20,343 --> 00:28:22,343
Thank you.

469
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,447
Oh, wait. Okay. Uh, f...

470
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:00,482
I've got one.

471
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:03,719
Um, why is Santa Claus scared

472
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,654
of getting stuck
in the chimney?

473
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:11,325
Oh, this is gonna be bad.

474
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:14,596
Because he's claustrophobic.

475
00:29:14,598 --> 00:29:16,431
- Mm, that's actually not so bad.
- Not so bad.

476
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,364
- Not so b...
- Not so...

477
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:20,502
It's pretty, it's pretty good.

478
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:22,771
Are you going to invite
your new friend

479
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:24,673
over for our
orphans' Christmas dinner?

480
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,742
"Orphans' Christmas dinner"?

481
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:30,545
It's, like, a potluck we do
for anybody

482
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:32,547
who's left over here
over the break.

483
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,082
7:00. Are you here?

484
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,884
Uh, yeah.
I don't leave until Sunday.

485
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:38,352
So... I mean, is that o...

486
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:39,621
- Are you cool... with...
- Mm.

487
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:40,624
Okay.

488
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,692
Good girl.

489
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,527
Let's not pretend
like I'm the only one.

490
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:47,896
I'm wearing a thong
and some other underwear.

491
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,731
I'm not wearing anything.

492
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:52,768
How come you've never
talked to me before?

493
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,304
You come into the café
every day.

494
00:29:56,573 --> 00:29:58,575
I, um...

495
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,112
I... uh, it just takes me
a while to figure out how to...

496
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:06,414
approach things.

497
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,816
But don't give up
on me, though.

498
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:11,486
I... I always
figure it out eventually.

499
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:13,423
- Mm.
- So...

500
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:46,648
Hello?

501
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,985
Anyone there?

502
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,809
The star of the evening.

503
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:50,111
I can't believe you did that
in front of Brian last night.

504
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:52,514
What?

505
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:53,982
I don't know. I thought
I'd feel good about it,

506
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:55,283
but I just feel weird.

507
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:57,521
Dude. You won.

508
00:32:58,722 --> 00:32:59,854
Enjoy it.

509
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,658
All right.

510
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:03,992
I got to pack.

511
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:05,927
My sister... biological...

512
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,996
will string me up
if I'm late for the train.

513
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:10,031
Promise to
take good care of Claudette.

514
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:12,133
- I promise.
- And don't overfeed her.

515
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:13,935
It took an entire year
to slim her down

516
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:14,936
after last winter break.

517
00:33:14,938 --> 00:33:16,938
Happy holidays, Franny.

518
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,010
Hey, Merry Christmas
from this Jew to you.

519
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:27,048
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
We've got errands to run.

520
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,084
- Has anyone seen my mitten?
- Hey. He's stressing me out.

521
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,752
He's in father goose mode.

522
00:33:30,754 --> 00:33:32,620
- It'll pass.
- Has anyone seen my other mitten?

523
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:34,155
- Let's go!
- I think someone was here

524
00:33:34,157 --> 00:33:35,957
- from DKO last night.
- What? Why?

525
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,959
Look, it's the same stuff
that was at the frat.

526
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,894
- Why is all our stuff missing?
- Cheap champagne will do that.

527
00:33:39,896 --> 00:33:41,763
What do you think it is?
Do you think it's paint?

528
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:43,932
- The dirty junk of frat boy scum.
- No, I'm serious.

529
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,734
I think they're planning
a prank or something.

530
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:47,902
Ah, right. The classic
painting the cat's paws prank.

531
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:50,171
They probably took Jesse's crystal,

532
00:33:50,173 --> 00:33:51,673
my mitten
and Fran's DivaCup, too.

533
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:52,774
Ho, ho, ho.

534
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:54,175
Okay. If the girth of this tree

535
00:33:54,177 --> 00:33:56,077
isn't how I want it,
I know I'm blaming you guys

536
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,645
'cause you took
frickin' forever to get ready.

537
00:33:57,647 --> 00:33:58,613
We can't control
a girth of a tree.

538
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:00,081
Well, yeah, you can.
If we got there in time,

539
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:00,982
there would... I don't know.

540
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:02,884
Nate, did you get
this door fixed yet?

541
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:04,085
- Let's go! Riley, come on!
- Coming.

542
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:05,820
I'm coming.

543
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,989
Ow.

544
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:11,126
Drive, drive, drive!

545
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:12,160
Good?

546
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:13,797
Let's do it.

547
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:23,807
Claudette?

548
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:30,845
Claudette?

549
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:34,117
Claudette?
Are you in here?

550
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:44,959
If you make me late
for the train,

551
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,963
I swear I'm never
feeding you again.

552
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,932
Ask my childhood hamster.

553
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:52,936
He's super dead.

554
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:57,839
Claudette? Seriously.

555
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,843
Where are you?

556
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:05,747
Sweetheart?

557
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:07,682
Where are you?

558
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:13,023
Are you hurt, angel?

559
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,665
Oh, there you are.

560
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,867
Ooh, I like that one.
The tree the guy has.

561
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:27,936
That means it's taken. Mm-hmm.

562
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:29,904
Options.

563
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:32,774
That's a little bit of you, isn't it?

564
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:34,008
- This one's, you know, humble.
- Mm?

565
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,043
This guy's leaning.

566
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,678
- I think you...
- Humble?

567
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,146
I think this one deserves
a loving home.

568
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:41,216
- Guys, this one.
- Yeah.

569
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:43,051
No.

570
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,053
- This is it.
- Kris.

571
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:47,122
- I cannot afford something that big.
- No, it's okay.

572
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:49,791
My dad left me his card
so I can spend whatever I want

573
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:52,160
over winter break 'cause he
bailed on our St. Barts trip.

574
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:53,962
All right. Let's do it.

575
00:35:53,964 --> 00:35:55,697
- Do you need any help, baby?
- Oh.

576
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,232
- No. I got it.
- Whoa. - Okay.

577
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:58,900
You're doing the most.

578
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:00,034
All right.

579
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,045
Keep going. Keep going.

580
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:25,894
Hello?

581
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:30,832
Hello?

582
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:36,771
Hello?

583
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,273
Oh, thank God I got through.

584
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:40,808
- It's Helena's mom.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Rittenhouse.

585
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,810
Do you know where Helena is?

586
00:36:42,812 --> 00:36:45,013
She was supposed to be here
a few hours ago,

587
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:47,182
and I haven't heard from her
since yesterday.

588
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:49,117
I'm a little worried.

589
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,985
Well, um,

590
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:52,987
I'm not there right now,

591
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:55,023
but I can check
as soon as I get back.

592
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:56,057
Oh, would you?

593
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:57,859
Oh, that would be,
that would be really great.

594
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:59,127
- Of course.
- Thank you so much, Riley.

595
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,962
- Okay.
- Thank you.

596
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,830

Your mom called,

00:38:11,234 --> 00:38:13,136
Love you. Bye.

615
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:29,317
She's not there.

616
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:31,119
Her phone's off.

617
00:38:31,121 --> 00:38:33,389
And Lindsay from Delta Sig
didn't get home, either.

618
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,425
I think we should tell campus
security that she's missing.

619
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,192
Okay, let's not forget that

620
00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:40,295
she did have
food poisoning last night

621
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:44,198
and could've easily overslept
and gotten on a later train.

622
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,334
- She is only a couple hours late.
- Damn, babe.

623
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:48,336
- Can you hold it straight?
- I'm dealing with something

624
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:50,071
a little more important
right now, Smoosh.

625
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:51,339
It's snowy as hell out there.

626
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:52,874
Her shit probably got delayed.

627
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,142
Please just hold
the tree straight.

628
00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:56,478
Why are you so grouchy
right now?

629
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,980
I'm not being grouchy.

630
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:00,416
I just want to get the tree up.

631
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:01,916
- Hold. Okay?
- Okay, look. You just made it crooked.

632
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:03,017
This is so inefficient.
I love it.

633
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:06,220
Guys, do I just turn on
the oven and put the ham in?

634
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:07,957
It seems too easy.

635
00:39:09,393 --> 00:39:12,228
Something doesn't feel right.

00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:20,263

- Hey.

00:40:22,098 --> 00:40:23,499

No.

648
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:50,057
I... I don't have social media.

649
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:53,161
I'm freaked out
by all the privacy stuff.

650
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:55,464
But I'd get it.

651
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:58,101
Uh, I'd DM you

Helena Rittenhouse.

- She's a sophomore.
- Missing?

661
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,281
- It's winter break.
- I know.

662
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:50,385
But she was supposed to be
home earlier today,

Yes. DMs.

Well, I've been getting them
since this morning,

671
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:15,142
and they're from a Calvin
Hawthorne account, which I...

672
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:18,614
My sisters and I did
this stupid performance

673
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:22,551
last night at DKO
kind of making fun of them.

674
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:27,422

Brian Huntley, is visiting.

00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,270
but I've seen
a lot of these cases,

705
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:52,507
and nine times out of ten, the
girl's just with a boyfriend.

706
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,510
If she's not back by tomorrow,
come see me.

707
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:56,645
That's it?

708
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:59,548
Wh-What about the messages?

709
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,782
I wouldn't worry about those.

710
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:02,484
Like you say,
they're probably just

711
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:04,519
pissed about
the little show you put on.

712
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,323
Boys will be... well, you know.

713
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:10,527
Can I give you a ride home?

714
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:14,463
No. I'm okay.

715
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:16,465
All right. Have a good break.

716
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:01,376
Oh.

717
00:45:01,378 --> 00:45:02,744
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,345
I was, um...

719
00:45:04,347 --> 00:45:06,313
- No, no. I'm sorry.
- I, uh...

720
00:45:06,315 --> 00:45:09,685
Looking for a comb that I lost.

721
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:11,453
But I...

722
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,724
I can come back.

723
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,226
Nonsense.

724
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:19,628
I have a key.

725
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,398
Please.

726
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,333
I promised
I'd let the cleaners in

727
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:29,270
while the boys
went on their ski trip.

728
00:45:29,272 --> 00:45:31,305
I hope you don't mind
my saying so,

729
00:45:31,307 --> 00:45:36,343
but a few of the boys did
confide in me that the prank

730
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:38,814
Mu Kappa played last night
went a little bit too far.

731
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:42,851
I think it only right
Miss Waterson remove the video.

732
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:45,821
It's online?

733
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:47,489
Now, which key is it?

734
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:50,559
Well, I'm not entirely sure
how these things work,

735
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,627
but it did seem to be
heavily watched.

736
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:56,064
30,000 views or something.

737
00:45:56,066 --> 00:45:58,767
The video she posted of me
garnered less than half that.

738
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:01,335
Between this
and her petition against me,

739
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:03,739
it seems Miss Waterson's
passion for equality

740
00:46:03,741 --> 00:46:05,743
cannot be bridled.

741
00:46:08,712 --> 00:46:11,715
Oh, dear.
I didn't mean to bring that up.

742
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:14,783
It's just...

743
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:17,488
Hawthorne means so much to me.

744
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:22,591
This school has
200 years of history.

745
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:26,497
Many sacrifices have been made
to keep our traditions alive.

746
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:32,534
I just wanted to make sure
you're aware of

747
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:35,704
the possible
legal repercussions.

748
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:36,872
The public accusation
at the end

749
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:38,475
could be considered defamatory.

750
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:43,344
Let's see if this works,
shall we?

751
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:47,883
Ah. There we go.

752
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:50,519
After you.

753
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:51,787
I have to go.

754
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,757
What about your comb?

755
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:57,559
Miss Stone.

756
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:11,139
♪ Here comes Mary Christmas,
ready as can be... ♪

757
00:47:11,141 --> 00:47:13,508
I can't believe
how easy it was to cook.

758
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,944
I could've been making ham
all my life.

759
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:18,482
- Babe, can you help me a little bit?
- Mmm.

760
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:21,317
Since when do you drink beer?

761
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:24,386
I like beer.

762
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:25,787
Okay, new game.
Top three animals.

763
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:27,789
- Go.
- That's a dumb game.

764
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,724
- Well, then you don't have to play.
- Nate.

765
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:30,792
Okay. Marty, you go first.

766
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,762
Um, I actually can't right now.
I'm a little busy.

767
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:34,830
Please?

768
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:37,532
Okay. Fine. Um...

769
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:39,167
The first one would
probably be an owl,

770
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:40,902
and then a bunny,
and then an ant.

771
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,604
Wow.

772
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,573
Ant. That's bold.

773
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:45,807
What's the game?

774
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:48,977
Okay. Number one animal, owl...
that's how you see yourself.

775
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:50,545
- I see that.
- Mm-hmm.

776
00:47:50,547 --> 00:47:52,414
Number two animal, um, bunny...

777
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:53,615
that's what you look for
in a romantic partner.

778
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:54,816
Not today, apparently.

779
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:56,751
And then third animal, ant...

780
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:58,753
that's what you want
in friends.

781
00:47:58,755 --> 00:48:01,857
Why the ant, Marty?

782
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:02,858
I don't know.

783
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,759
I guess they're strong,

784
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:06,795
and they're all kind of, like, one unit.

785
00:48:06,797 --> 00:48:08,697
Um, and you can't kill an ant

786
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:10,465
because they're all
an extension of the others.

787
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:11,935
That's really poetic.

788
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:14,703
What the hell, Kris?!

789
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:15,971
Did you talk
to campus security?

790
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:17,839
You posted the video
from last night online?

791
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:19,641
Yeah. Why?
Is it getting views?

792
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:20,909
Did you watch it
the whole way through?

793
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:21,977
Uh, I didn't need to.
I lived it.

794
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:23,845
Maybe that'll
teach Brian Huntley

795
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:24,980
not to rape another girl.

796
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:26,516
Oh, God.

797
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:31,052
- Okay.
- No. Where are you going?

798
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:33,989
I'm gonna go get Christmas
lights for the dinner decor.

799
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,458
When you guys fight,
it high-key stresses me out.

800
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,927
Look, okay, I'm gonna cut
that part out right now.

801
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:41,930
It already has, like,
50,000 views.

802
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:44,699
Well, yeah.
I-I thought the point of

803
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:47,636
calling out frat boy rape
culture was to inspire women.

804
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:50,538
We're not inspiring people.

805
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,973
We're pissing people off.

806
00:48:51,975 --> 00:48:53,942
Gelson is cornering me.

807
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:57,879
I'm getting messed-up DMs
from God-knows-who.

808
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:00,982
- Helena's disappeared, and now the whole world...
- Wait, wait.

809
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:02,951
- Hold on. Hold on. No, no, no.
- ...knows that Brian Huntley...

810
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:04,953
Wait, wait. Back up. Hold on.
You're getting weird DMs?

811
00:49:04,955 --> 00:49:07,555
- Yeah.
- So am I.

812
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:12,027
♪ ...Mary is,
Santa's sure to go ♪

813
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:14,696

814
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:17,832

Okay.

818
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:46,830
Christmas lights.

819
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:49,597
Christmas lights.

820
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:50,699
What did Gelson say?

821
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:51,833
- Kris, are you getting them?
- Yes. Just ignore them.

822
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:54,602
They are boys with heavy
testicles. Did he threaten you?

823
00:49:54,604 --> 00:49:56,738
No. He just made it
pretty clear that he wants you

824
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,572
to drop the petition.

825
00:49:57,574 --> 00:49:58,974
So he thinks
that he can threaten us

826
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:00,608
and then we'll just drop this.

827
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:03,778
- Okay...
- This is just getting started!

828
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,916
- No. How about we...
- You're not listening to me!

829
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:10,885
No.

830
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:13,690
Bingo.

831
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:21,698
Let's see.

832
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:24,901
Shit.

833
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:28,038
Christmas lights.

834
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,982
Do Christmas lights expire?

835
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:42,052
Ugh.

836
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:46,187
Wait.

837
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:48,525
Let's try these.

838
00:50:55,132 --> 00:50:57,732
Okay.

839
00:50:58,735 --> 00:50:59,834
Helena wouldn't even be missing

840
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:02,137
if I'd just gone home
like I wanted to instead of

841
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:03,938
you forcing me
to sing your dumb song.

842
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,941
My song? That was my song?
We did that for you!

843
00:51:06,943 --> 00:51:08,810
I wouldn't have
sung it if you didn't...

844
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:11,679
You're so,
you're so pushy, Kris!

845
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:12,747
You never stop, do you?

846
00:51:12,749 --> 00:51:14,816
You just push and you push.

847
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,084
I don't stop
because they don't stop!

848
00:51:16,086 --> 00:51:18,820
Well, not everybody
wants to be like you!

849
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:21,656
Some of us are
quite happy to...

850
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:23,660
To just disappear!

851
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:26,963
What did you girls expect?

852
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:30,965
- Excuse me?
- I told you something like this

853
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:31,900
was gonna happen.

854
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:33,935
Okay? You humiliated
those guys up there.

855
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:34,903
Of course they're pissed.

856
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:36,704
And that gives them
an excuse to harass us?

857
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:38,706
What... If a bunch of
frat bros had gotten up

858
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:39,908
and sang a song about how,

859
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:40,909
I don't know,
women were just bimbos

860
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:42,977
who liked to show off
their tits, then yeah,

861
00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:44,879
- you'd be livid.
- It's a little different, Smoosh.

862
00:51:44,881 --> 00:51:47,182
How? Why are you allowed to say
all this shit about men,

863
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:48,950
and we're supposed to just
sit here and take it?

864
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:50,587
Because men have all the power.

865
00:51:51,254 --> 00:51:53,788
Not all men have power.

866
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,723
- Did you just "not all men" me? Did you just...
- Don't.

867
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:57,792
Not all men are rapists, Kris!

868
00:51:57,794 --> 00:51:59,027
- Okay? I'm not.
- No. Nobody...

869
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:01,129
But you just lump me in with
the bad ones because I'm a man?

870
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:02,730
No. Nobody is calling you
a rapist.

871
00:52:02,732 --> 00:52:03,965
- You imply it with your man-hating.
- "Man-hating"?

872
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,266
- What did I say that was so offensive?
- Okay.

873
00:52:05,268 --> 00:52:06,734
Hon, just calm down.
We're trying to have

874
00:52:06,736 --> 00:52:07,836
- a rational conversation.
- "Calm down"?

875
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:09,804
- Yeah.
- You want me to calm down?! Let's calm down!

876
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:11,739
Yeah, I want you to calm
down. Okay. You just trying...

877
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:13,174
- Shut up!
- What would you do if I grabbed you like this?!

878
00:52:13,176 --> 00:52:14,943
- Get out! Get out!
- You know what?

879
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:16,845
- You need to leave.
- The second I have a good point...

880
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,046
- Leave! I don't give a shit!
- No, no!

881
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:19,013
The second I have a good point,

882
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:20,048
- you tell me to leave you?!
- Who are you?!

883
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,149
- Get out of here!
- You know, I should've just

884
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:21,916
- dumped you last semester...
- I don't give a shit!

885
00:52:21,918 --> 00:52:26,154
- Get out!
- You're hysterical.

886
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:27,188
Jesus!

887
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,723
Oh, my God!

888
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:37,298
"I will bring you
to your knees"?

889
00:52:41,905 --> 00:52:43,805
"And you will beg for mercy"?

890
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:52,247
- There.
- What did you just do?

891
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:54,249
I said, "Hey, Calvin Hawthorne.
Why don't you come down here,

892
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:56,784
bite my ass, and make me
a panini on my mom's press?"

893
00:52:56,786 --> 00:52:57,785
Oh, my...

894
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:02,123
What was that?

895
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:10,131
Run!

896
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:12,936
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

897
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:16,938
Come on, Marty!

898
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,941
Come on!

899
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:25,313
Ow.

900
00:53:26,816 --> 00:53:29,217
Oh, shit.

901
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:30,854
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

902
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:37,892
I knew Helena was dead.
I knew.

903
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:39,894
- <i>I felt it.</i>
<i>- No, we don't know that.</i>

904
00:53:39,896 --> 00:53:40,762
<i>We don't know that.
All we know is</i>

905
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:42,063
<i>that we need
to get out of here.</i>

906
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:43,298
Who is that guy?

907
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,033
Could be anyone...
the Dekes, Gelson.

908
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:46,334
Look, we can sit here
and make a list

909
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:47,969
of all the guys
that want to kill us

910
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:49,771
or we could get out of here,
we could get help.

911
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:50,738
I can't. I can't.

912
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,607
- It hurts too much to move.
- You're okay.

913
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:54,042
Hold this. I got you.

914
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:56,311
Where's your phone, Ri?

915
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:58,046
It's downstairs.

916
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:00,116
Shit. I left mine downstairs.

917
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:02,850
<i>Marty's bleeding really bad.</i>

918
00:54:02,852 --> 00:54:05,121
<i>I need to stay with her
and tend her wound.</i>

919
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:08,923
Riley, we need a phone.

920
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:12,160
We need to call the cops
and warn all the other girls

921
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:15,098
- to stay away from that house.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

922
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:59,000
<i>I know I wasn't
always on your side.</i>

923
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:01,437
And I know that
we butt heads sometimes.

924
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:04,372
- It's okay.
- Um...

925
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:06,040
And I know that I always
lug Nate around,

926
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:09,079
but I really love it
when it's just the four of us.

927
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,116
Jesse.

928
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:17,118
Oh, God.

929
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,122
We've got to find her.

930
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:24,027
We're ants, Kris.

931
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:28,430
Okay.
Um, I'll do it.

932
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:30,399
You just... stay here.

933
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:32,302
Keep the door locked, okay?

934
00:57:48,178 --> 00:57:49,946
Jess?

935
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:17,173
Riley?

936
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,808
What are you doing down there?

937
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,376
Wh-Where's Marty?

938
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:23,479
I, uh, I just, I wanted to apologize.

939
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:26,047
I... I was having
this intense migraine.

940
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:28,082
- And I-I feel terrible.
- Nate.

941
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:32,186
There's someone in the house.

942
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:35,526
I need your phone.

943
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:41,430
Where's Marty?

944
00:58:41,432 --> 00:58:42,631
Please, Nate.

945
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:45,166
She's... she's hurt.

946
00:58:45,168 --> 00:58:48,236
And she needs a doctor,
but I need your phone.

947
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:49,638
No. Screw a phone.

948
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,607
Get the girls out of here,
all right?

949
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:54,443
If someone hurts my girl,
it's my duty to protect her.

950
00:58:54,445 --> 00:58:56,277
Show yourself, coward!

951
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,546
This is a man's...

952
00:59:10,326 --> 00:59:12,360
Stay away from me.

953
00:59:47,531 --> 00:59:49,565
Merry Christmas,
boys and girls.

954
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:51,332
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

955
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:20,296
Hey. Hey, hey.

956
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,337
Okay. You're okay.

957
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:30,474
We're here, okay?

958
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:33,276
Where's Jesse?

959
01:00:43,587 --> 01:00:45,522
Marty.

960
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:49,658
Nate?

961
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,393
Nate?! No!

962
01:00:51,395 --> 01:00:52,661
No. Oh.

963
01:00:52,663 --> 01:00:54,463
Oh... oh, God.

964
01:00:55,966 --> 01:00:58,265
Oh. No.

965
01:01:15,486 --> 01:01:18,285
What the fuck?

966
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:19,588
- Get out of here.
- Go.

967
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,456
Go. Go!

968
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:22,524
I got her!

969
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:28,295
Come on!

970
01:01:40,811 --> 01:01:42,844
You made your point.

971
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:44,780
Marty, get back here.

972
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:47,248
- I just called the police!
- Marty.

973
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,717
They'll be here any second.

974
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:52,253
Marty. Marty.

975
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:55,358
If you leave now,
you can save yourself.

976
01:01:57,795 --> 01:01:59,260
Marty.

977
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:00,731
Run!

978
01:02:07,638 --> 01:02:09,807
No! No! Come on!

979
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:18,840
- Security.
- 911, attack at Hawthorne College.

980
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:20,876
- What?
- Report's at 1974 Elm Road.

981
01:03:20,878 --> 01:03:23,411
I'm on my way.

982
01:03:45,803 --> 01:03:47,636
Get to the hall.

983
01:03:47,638 --> 01:03:49,437
Break for the door.

984
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:50,874
As fast as you can, okay?

985
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:53,877
Okay.

986
01:04:25,576 --> 01:04:26,810
No!

987
01:04:50,434 --> 01:04:51,499
Freeze!

988
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:16,460
Why isn't it blood?

989
01:05:34,845 --> 01:05:37,712
I've seen him before.
He's a DKO pledge.

990
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:39,581
Watch it, pledge.

991
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,483
Break that, and it's all over.

992
01:05:41,485 --> 01:05:43,954
You'll never be
part of the Deke army.

993
01:05:48,959 --> 01:05:51,760
Riley, we have to go
to the cops.

994
01:05:51,762 --> 01:05:55,630
I'm gonna go get Nate's keys,
and you meet me by the door.

995
01:05:55,632 --> 01:05:57,766
Okay? Okay.

996
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:34,504
This can't be real.

997
01:06:42,746 --> 01:06:44,079
Riley!

998
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:49,117
Riley!

999
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,768
Get the keys!

1000
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:10,607
Go!

1001
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:17,145
- Uh, come on.
- Kris, open the door!

1002
01:07:17,147 --> 01:07:19,647
I-I got it! Ah.

1003
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:22,117
Kris, hurry, hurry!

1004
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:23,718
Come on, Kris!
Open the door!

1005
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,687
I got it!

1006
01:07:30,794 --> 01:07:32,027
Come on.

1007
01:07:32,863 --> 01:07:35,663
Go! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1008
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:38,666
Oh, my God. Okay.

1009
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:40,702
Hey, we're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

1010
01:07:40,704 --> 01:07:41,736
Oh, God.

1011
01:07:41,738 --> 01:07:43,138
Who the hell were those guys?

1012
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,673
- Something crazy is going on.
- Yeah, no shit.

1013
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:47,742
A bunch of dudes
just tried to kill us.

1014
01:07:47,744 --> 01:07:49,010
No, I mean
I saw that guy before,

1015
01:07:49,012 --> 01:07:50,245
the night of the talent show.

1016
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:52,747
The Dekes were doing some sort
of ritual with the pledges.

1017
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:53,815
It's a frat.

1018
01:07:53,817 --> 01:07:56,051
- Pledges pledge frats.
- No, this felt different.

1019
01:07:56,053 --> 01:07:59,821
It was like they were doing
something with this black stuff

1020
01:07:59,823 --> 01:08:01,890
that was coming out of
the founder's bust.

1021
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:03,158
It was like...

1022
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,194
It was like black magic
or sorcery or something.

1023
01:08:06,196 --> 01:08:08,229
So you're telling me
you think the DKO boys

1024
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:10,198
possessed their pledges
in some-some

1025
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,966
supernatural hazing ritual?

1026
01:08:11,968 --> 01:08:13,402
Well, you saw
the pledge's face.

1027
01:08:13,404 --> 01:08:14,437
You saw his blood.

1028
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:17,238
I don't know what he was,
but he was changed.

1029
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,708
He wasn't human.

1030
01:08:19,743 --> 01:08:21,410
Think about it.

1031
01:08:21,412 --> 01:08:25,046
The bust gets brought into
the founder's fraternity.

1032
01:08:25,048 --> 01:08:28,650
Brian Huntley turns up
to meet with the new pledges,

1033
01:08:28,652 --> 01:08:32,187
and then we all start
getting these messages

1034
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:35,223
from a Calvin Hawthorne
account.

1035
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:36,958
Lindsay goes missing.

1036
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,661
Helena goes missing.

1037
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:42,230
Marty and Jesse are dead.

1038
01:08:42,232 --> 01:08:45,735
I mean, all of this
leads back to DKO.

1039
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:48,970
I need you to help me.

1040
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:50,839
I need you
to create a distraction

1041
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:52,874
so that I can
sneak into the room

1042
01:08:52,876 --> 01:08:55,844
where they were holding the
ceremony and get to the bust,

1043
01:08:55,846 --> 01:08:58,213
because that is where
the power is coming from.

1044
01:08:58,215 --> 01:08:59,981
Excuse me. What?

1045
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:02,851
A magical bust?
No. We're going to the cops.

1046
01:09:02,853 --> 01:09:04,152
What are we gonna tell them?

1047
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:05,987
I would like to remind you

1048
01:09:05,989 --> 01:09:09,023
that we just killed three
people who, possessed or not,

1049
01:09:09,025 --> 01:09:11,759
are lying dead
in our house right now.

1050
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:13,228
It was self-defense.

1051
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:15,765
Well, you want to count on
the cops believing that?

1052
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,033
They didn't believe me

1053
01:09:19,035 --> 01:09:22,070
when I told them
what Brian had done to me.

1054
01:09:22,072 --> 01:09:25,142
So what makes you think that
they're gonna believe us now?

1055
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,845
You don't even believe me.

1056
01:09:33,484 --> 01:09:35,717
- Pull over.
- No.

1057
01:09:35,719 --> 01:09:37,719
- Pull the car over, damn it!
- Shit, Riley!

1058
01:09:37,721 --> 01:09:38,987
Riley! What are you doing?!

1059
01:09:38,989 --> 01:09:40,221
Jesus, Riley, stop!

1060
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,224
Stop! No!

1061
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:51,067
I thought that
you were a fighter.

1062
01:10:20,297 --> 01:10:21,963
Riley?

1063
01:10:21,965 --> 01:10:24,834
I was just on my way
to orphans' dinn...

1064
01:10:26,236 --> 01:10:28,169
Whoa, what happened?

1065
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:29,170
Riley.

1066
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:31,107
Hey, Riley. What...

1067
01:10:33,143 --> 01:10:34,976
Hey, c-can, can I help you?

1068
01:10:34,978 --> 01:10:36,913
What-what do you need from me?

1069
01:10:42,152 --> 01:10:45,155
Well, you really want to help?

1070
01:11:05,409 --> 01:11:07,875
Let us in!

1071
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:10,044
- Is it happening to you, too?
- Yeah.

1072
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:12,048
And to Thetas, Pis and Kappas, too.

1073
01:11:13,216 --> 01:11:15,885
We need to go to the cops, now.

1074
01:11:17,388 --> 01:11:19,254
- Go.
- Go.

1075
01:11:19,256 --> 01:11:21,324
Go, go, go!

1076
01:11:54,891 --> 01:11:58,126
All right.
Uh, he's been Zeta'd.

1077
01:11:58,128 --> 01:12:00,396
Uh, you've been Zeta'd.

1078
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:03,833
Yeah. You've been Zeta'd.

1079
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:11,074
Come on.

1080
01:12:13,076 --> 01:12:14,210
Seriously?

1081
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:17,345
Hey!

1082
01:12:17,347 --> 01:12:19,448
Not cool!

1083
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:22,050
You ruined my mixer!

1084
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:24,486
Hey!

1085
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:26,187
Dickheads!

1086
01:12:26,189 --> 01:12:28,424
Come get me,
you pieces of shit!

1087
01:12:34,498 --> 01:12:36,966
Morons!

1088
01:12:41,472 --> 01:12:43,039
Oh, hey, guys.

1089
01:12:44,675 --> 01:12:46,375
How's it g...

1090
01:12:48,379 --> 01:12:49,678
Oh, shit.

1091
01:12:58,088 --> 01:12:59,688
What do you want, crease?

1092
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:02,491
I want, um...

1093
01:13:02,493 --> 01:13:04,258
I-I... I want you

1094
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,431
to suck a fat fart
'cause you just got Zeta'd.

1095
01:13:09,467 --> 01:13:12,100
I know for a fact
you're not in Zeta.

1096
01:13:12,102 --> 01:13:14,135
But you can pledge our frat
if you want.

1097
01:13:14,137 --> 01:13:17,205
Just got to go through a...
a little hazing ritual.

1098
01:13:28,519 --> 01:13:30,952
Uh...

1099
01:13:31,955 --> 01:13:33,555
Got a headache, bro?

1100
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:37,291
That's just the founder

1101
01:13:37,293 --> 01:13:39,561
drawing out your true alpha.

1102
01:13:59,517 --> 01:14:02,185
Help! Somebody help me, please!

1103
01:14:06,322 --> 01:14:08,122
Help!

1104
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:09,926
Helena.

1105
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,463
- Oh, thank God you're here.
- You're alive.

1106
01:14:14,465 --> 01:14:16,197
Yeah, we have to hurry, okay?
Okay. Okay.

1107
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:17,499
Someone could come back
at any second.

1108
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:19,501
- Did they hurt you?
- No, I think I'm okay.

1109
01:14:19,503 --> 01:14:21,437
I'm okay.

1110
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:23,104
I thought no one would find me

1111
01:14:23,106 --> 01:14:24,272
and I'd be
trapped here forever.

1112
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:26,410
You're okay now.
You're okay.

1113
01:14:30,881 --> 01:14:33,049
Nice work, sweetie.

1114
01:14:52,503 --> 01:14:55,504
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1115
01:14:55,506 --> 01:14:58,072
The spirit of the founder
compels you.

1116
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:01,075
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1117
01:15:02,413 --> 01:15:05,583
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1118
01:15:07,217 --> 01:15:08,216
Imagine a world

1119
01:15:08,218 --> 01:15:10,819
where you're no longer
sitting in the corner.

1120
01:15:10,821 --> 01:15:13,156
You're sitting on the throne.

1121
01:15:21,432 --> 01:15:23,499
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1122
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:25,166
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1123
01:15:26,369 --> 01:15:28,204
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1124
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,608
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1125
01:15:31,509 --> 01:15:33,511
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1126
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:37,412
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

1127
01:15:52,095 --> 01:15:53,497
What's going on?

1128
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:58,467
What did you do to Landon?

1129
01:15:58,469 --> 01:16:01,436
He is who he was always
meant to be: a fighter.

1130
01:16:01,438 --> 01:16:02,871
A true man.

1131
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:08,644
You see, when your friend,
Miss Waterson,

1132
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:11,880
had the founder's statue
removed and brought here,

1133
01:16:11,882 --> 01:16:16,284
the boys discovered something
magical hidden inside.

1134
01:16:16,286 --> 01:16:18,687
Towards the end of his life,

1135
01:16:18,689 --> 01:16:22,457
Hawthorne foresaw
the threat posed by women.

1136
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:23,892
So he took precautions

1137
01:16:23,894 --> 01:16:25,694
in case they strayed
too far out of line.

1138
01:16:25,696 --> 01:16:28,564
A master of the dark arts,

1139
01:16:28,566 --> 01:16:32,233
he left instructions on how
to create an army of young men

1140
01:16:32,235 --> 01:16:34,403
to take our power back.

1141
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:37,539
You're all insane.

1142
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,708
No, no.
Not insane, Miss Stone.

1143
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,342
Simply men,

1144
01:16:41,344 --> 01:16:44,211
tired of seeing ourselves
falsely accused,

1145
01:16:44,213 --> 01:16:45,313
our livelihoods threatened,

1146
01:16:45,315 --> 01:16:47,516
marginalized and belittled,

1147
01:16:47,518 --> 01:16:50,320
reduced to spectators
in our own lives.

1148
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:52,621
Upon graduation,

1149
01:16:52,623 --> 01:16:54,556
our army will
venture into courtrooms,

1150
01:16:54,558 --> 01:16:56,725
boardrooms and
the halls of Congress

1151
01:16:56,727 --> 01:16:58,594
to set the world right.

1152
01:17:00,764 --> 01:17:03,230
It was really very simple.

1153
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:06,501
<i>A hazing ritual, if you will.</i>

1154
01:17:06,503 --> 01:17:08,604
<i>We read the incantation
inside the bust,</i>

1155
01:17:08,606 --> 01:17:11,740
<i>and the spirit of Calvin
Hawthorne filled the pledges,</i>

1156
01:17:11,742 --> 01:17:13,375
<i>possessing them with</i>

1157
01:17:13,377 --> 01:17:16,243
<i>supernatural strength
and drive.</i>

1158
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:18,212
All we had to do
was name the women

1159
01:17:18,214 --> 01:17:19,414
who had stepped out of line,

1160
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:22,249
and these boys
took care of the rest.

1161
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:23,487
Be conscientious objectors
like Lindsay...

1162
01:17:25,656 --> 01:17:27,522
...sign my petition against Professor Gelson?

1163
01:17:28,358 --> 01:17:30,392
♪ Ho, ho, ho,
I didn't know... ♪

1164
01:17:34,798 --> 01:17:38,232
Women who are
willing to be obedient,

1165
01:17:38,234 --> 01:17:40,469
like your friend here,
will be spared.

1166
01:17:40,471 --> 01:17:43,304
Those of you
who refuse to be compliant

1167
01:17:43,306 --> 01:17:44,708
will face the consequences.

1168
01:17:51,782 --> 01:17:55,719
Aren't you tired of fighting
against your true nature, Ri?

1169
01:17:57,621 --> 01:18:00,455
Just because we're taking
our rightful place behind them

1170
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:03,425
doesn't mean
that we aren't needed.

1171
01:18:03,427 --> 01:18:06,461
<i>They needed me
to collect the objects</i>

1172
01:18:06,463 --> 01:18:08,697
<i>from the girls
so the pledges would know</i>

1173
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:10,297
who to go after.

1174
01:18:10,299 --> 01:18:11,633
<i>I have a final in ten minutes,</i>

1175
01:18:11,635 --> 01:18:13,404
and I can't find my DivaCup.

1176
01:18:15,572 --> 01:18:17,306
Thanks for the comb,
by the way.

1177
01:18:22,278 --> 01:18:26,381
How could you do that
to your sisters?

1178
01:18:26,383 --> 01:18:28,450
I'm helping women.

1179
01:18:28,452 --> 01:18:31,687
Everything is j...
so out of whack.

1180
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:34,355
It's so much easier this way.

1181
01:18:34,357 --> 01:18:37,260
You are a traitor!

1182
01:18:42,866 --> 01:18:44,866
This is your last chance, Ri.

1183
01:18:44,868 --> 01:18:47,301
You can join me.

1184
01:18:47,303 --> 01:18:49,440
We can be good women.

1185
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:52,339
Or...

1186
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:54,443
Or we will bring you
to your knees

1187
01:18:54,445 --> 01:18:55,746
and you will beg for mercy.

1188
01:18:57,548 --> 01:19:00,515
Still creating problems,
huh, Ri?

1189
01:19:00,517 --> 01:19:02,050
You see, you were
given a chance.

1190
01:19:02,052 --> 01:19:04,351
You were taught how to grow
into a proper woman,

1191
01:19:04,353 --> 01:19:05,321
but you refused to listen.

1192
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:11,360
Now it's time to decide.

1193
01:19:20,671 --> 01:19:24,441
Are you gonna bow to the king
when I say "bow"?

1194
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:30,246
Bow.

1195
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:37,353
I said bow, bitch.

1196
01:19:41,725 --> 01:19:43,727
You need a reminder
of our power?

1197
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,797
Fine.

1198
01:19:58,575 --> 01:20:00,276
Baby?

1199
01:20:05,816 --> 01:20:06,884
Who put that there?

1200
01:20:08,552 --> 01:20:10,552
It's for the cause.

1201
01:20:10,554 --> 01:20:13,588
But I did everything
that I was supposed...

1202
01:20:16,126 --> 01:20:19,828
He'll do worse than that to you.

1203
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,865
Your body, your choice.

1204
01:20:31,608 --> 01:20:33,608
I'll bow.

1205
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,478
I'll bow.
I'll be good.

1206
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,879
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

1207
01:20:37,881 --> 01:20:39,714
You dragged my name
through the mud.

1208
01:20:39,716 --> 01:20:42,918
You lied about what happened
and tried to destroy me.

1209
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,854
I told you guys I could
get her to do it. Huh?

1210
01:20:45,856 --> 01:20:48,790
Who's the king?! Who's the king?!

1211
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:51,159
Who's the mighty king?!

1212
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:52,861
You took everything from me!

1213
01:20:54,031 --> 01:20:56,865
And one day, someone will
tell everyone what you did,

1214
01:20:56,867 --> 01:20:59,601
and people will believe her!

1215
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:08,344
See no evil, boys.

1216
01:21:17,688 --> 01:21:19,888
You all right, bro?

1217
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,892
Absolutely.

1218
01:21:31,902 --> 01:21:34,905
You messed with
the wrong sisters.

1219
01:23:20,077 --> 01:23:23,578
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1220
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:25,313
Don't you see?

1221
01:23:25,315 --> 01:23:29,017
Woman is inextricably
tied to man.

1222
01:23:29,019 --> 01:23:31,920
Break us, and you'll
only break yourselves.

1223
01:23:33,857 --> 01:23:35,657
We will never be broken.

1224
01:23:38,762 --> 01:23:40,797
No!

1225
01:23:50,974 --> 01:23:52,943
Hey, Professor.

1226
01:23:54,878 --> 01:23:57,014
Suck my...

1227
01:24:32,115 --> 01:24:33,815
I'm so sorry!
You were right!

1228
01:24:33,817 --> 01:24:35,183
I should've been fighting
