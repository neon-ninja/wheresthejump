00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,690
Our Father, who art
in Heaven, hallowed by thy name.

3
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:40,394
...be done, on Earth,
as it is in Heaven.

4
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:48,202
Forgive us our trespasses,
and lead us not into temptation.

5
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:51,276
But deliver us from evil.
Amen.

6
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:10,250
It's me.

7
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:14,122
By a richer parent,

8
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,171
in the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

9
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:18,347
I command you
to give me your name.

10
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,019
You will submit

11
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:26,378
before the cross
of our high priest,

12
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,266
the creator
of heaven and Earth,

13
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,731
our one and only God,
Jesus Christ.

14
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:32,523
Give me your name!

15
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:37,866
Beleth.

16
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,890
We have its name...
Beleth.

17
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:44,874
Now we can read
the appropriate rites.

18
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,378
We expel the tormentor.

19
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:13,099
Beleth, deceiver
and unholy servant of Satan,

20
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:15,019
I command thee!

21
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,363
I order thee, Beleth,
abandon the body

22
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:27,211
and never again return
to torment its soul.

23
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,259
Beleth,
by the power of God...

24
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:37,514
You are too weak
to defeat me.

25
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,370
Beleth,
by the power of God,

26
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:41,771
return to the wasteland
he appointed you.

27
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,202
Aah!
Aah!

28
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:47,339
Beleth, depart,
scum of Hell!

29
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,331
Depart!

30
00:02:48,363 --> 00:02:52,459
Be gone in the name
of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

31
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:53,770
Be gone!

32
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:26,859
Mama.

33
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:35,659
Another demon vanquished,
another soul liberated.

34
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,123
God is good.

35
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:43,690
And the power of prayer,
your prayer, is great.

36
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:46,123
Join us again next week

37
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,939
to witness yet another miracle,
God willing.

38
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:51,627
In the meantime,
follow us @CleansingHour

39
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,699
and @FatherMaxTCH on social.

40
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,507
Thank you once again
for your support.

41
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,411
God bless you
and may the Devil miss you.

42
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,562
And cut!

43
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:17,611
Nice job, everybody!
Good show!

44
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:20,491
Hey, somebody get this guy
an Oscar, huh?

45
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:21,771
I'd like to thank
my mother-in-law

46
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,923
for the inspiration.

47
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:24,587
Well, thank you very much. Thank
you. Thanks. Appreciate it.

48
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,155
Hey, if you're going to
take any pictures,

49
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:28,043
do not
post them anywhere.

50
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:31,083
Thank you.
Nice show, man.

51
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:33,706
50,000 followers,
and I'm still not verified.

52
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,147
I'm never going to
be respected if I don't have

53
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,971
that little blue check mark
right next to my name.

54
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:40,587
Hey, did you, um, did you
read the e-mail I sent you?

55
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:42,859
The one
about branching out?

56
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,201
Did you read it?

57
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,539
Could you read it?

58
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,123
- Five million followers.
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,299
What I wouldn't do
for that kind of audience.

60
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,666
That's what I want
to talk to you about, okay?

61
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:55,786
I mean...

62
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,259
viewerships' peaked,
right?

63
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,755
Mm, you got to book
my boy Dante.

64
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:02,731
Drag queen, he...
<i>she ...</i> works at the bingo night

65
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:07,178
at the Bodice Lounge
as Scarlet von Cock.

66
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,683
Get it?
You get it?

67
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,443
Yeah, I get it.

68
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,938
Hey, I want to talk to you
about expansion.

69
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,890
Hey, who's drinking
with us tonight?!

70
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,738
We need to talk about expansion,
okay?

71
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,139
Ghost hunts, séances...

72
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,707
Drew?

73
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,011
Drew, we talked
about this, man.

74
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:25,707
- Priests don't do séances, bro.
- I know, I know.

75
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:27,050
But I got this girl.
She's great.

76
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,491
She's got her own stuff,
she won't...

77
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:30,538
Scarlett von Cock,
man.

78
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:32,651
She's fabulous,
okay?

79
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,251
Just book her.

80
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:36,587
Thomas, the bulk!
Mm!

81
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:40,138
Yeah, that thing right there
with the gurney was mm!

82
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:41,227
You ask,
I deliver.

83
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm thinking we need a little
bit more pyro, though...

84
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:44,075
exploding lights,

85
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:46,538
uh, me silhouetted against
a shower of sparks,

86
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,915
like Clint Eastwood
or something.

87
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,386
Hell, yeah, love it.

88
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:50,859
Yo.
When's the show start?

89
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:54,379
Uh, Max,
meet my delightful niece,

90
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:55,659
Riley,
our new PA.

91
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,699
She's studying movies at SC,
where, apparently,

92
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,107
they don't use clocks.

93
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:01,291
Don't worry about that.

94
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:02,955
They gave me shit
about that all the time.

95
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,331
Like, we're artists.
We beat to our own drum.

96
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,706
I get it.

97
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:06,987
I love this whole look,
by the way.

98
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:10,091
It's very circa 2000s
Gwen Stefani.

99
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:12,107
You're working it.

100
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,090
What's the pay here?

101
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:17,003
Alright, Riles, why don't you go
and explore the set

102
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:18,347
and try not
to break anything.

103
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,843
Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

104
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,187
Are you coming tonight?

105
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,978
Are you
gonna be there?

106
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:26,603
- I'll pass.
- Your boy's coming.

107
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,011
I'm not going.

108
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,131
Dude,
we never hang out anymore.

109
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,379
What do you
want me to do?

110
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,171
I got like
a ton of orders to fill.

111
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:35,851

Excuse me,
Father Max.

154
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:33,931
Hi.

155
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:35,691
Um, I just
wanted to say that

156
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:37,515
we're, like,
your biggest fans.

157
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,531
Well,
bless your little hearts.

158
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,355
Can you sign
my prayer cloths?

159
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:44,299
Yeah.

160
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,115
Please, come, join us.
Hey, scoot over.

161
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,274
That's fine.
You guys sit down.

162
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,522
- This is Brenda.
- Hi.

163
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:01,642
I'm Desiree,

164
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,723
like, "desire,"
with an extra "E."

165
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,451
Cool!. Hey, you guys have fun.
I'm going to head home.

166
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:06,890
I'm going to go
fuck myself.

167
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:09,131
I am intrigued.

168
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:12,202
So, Father Max, um,
we're curious.

169
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:15,563
How does
a good-looking guy like yourself

170
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:17,450
take a vow of celibacy?

171
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:18,922
Well...

172
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:25,515
Well,
it can get very, very hard.

173
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,467
Are you really
a priest?

174
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,338
Think I lie to you?

175
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,331
I don't know.

176
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:44,138
I've just never met one
who's, you know, fun.

177
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:47,562
You think I'm fun, huh?

178
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,867
Ever since
I was a kid,

179
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,331
I wanted
to fight evil head on,

180
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,059
be on the front lines
of the spiritual world,

181
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,202
like the Archangel Michael.

182
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:04,490
Spent 10 years in school,
got ordained,

183
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,699
only to have
the church I love

184
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,771
deny
my singular ambition.

185
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:12,555
Being an exorcist.

186
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:15,691
So I quit.

187
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:17,803
Taught myself.

188
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,723
And you know what?

189
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,738
God's still with me.

190
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,427
I can feel it.

191
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,434
I can feel it, too.

192
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:28,939
Mm.

193
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,355
Do you wear a wig?

194
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,531
Aah!

195
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,195
What?
What did I do?

196
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:50,890
Oh, no, no.
You... You were good.

197
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:53,418
Do you want some... Do you want
some breakfast? You hungry?

198
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,178
You want
a homemade breakfast?

199
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:03,851
Thank you.

200
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:06,442
Show's plateaued,
man.

201
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:08,491
Can't grow an audience
without new content,

202
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:12,106
but Max will only do shows
that he can star in.

203
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,451
That's shocking.

204
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:16,235
Two, three...

205
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,546
I booked that zombie movie
with Jared Leto.

206
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,210
- Really?!
- First make-up assist.

207
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:26,058
Oh, my God!
That's awesome.

208
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,691
Mm!

209
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:28,874
Mm.

210
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,155
Oh, man, it is gonna suck
to lose you.

211
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,371
Maybe you should
quit the show, too.

212
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:38,955
What? Give up
on a thriving business?

213
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:41,002
Come on, we got
a wedding to pay for.

214
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,666
And besides,
I've known Max

215
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,171
since we were altar boys,
you know?

216
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,795
I can't just
abandon him.

217
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:50,058
I don't know if
he'd say the same about you.

218
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,978
You don't know him
like I do.

219
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,442
Wow!
Look at that.

220
00:11:57,386 --> 00:12:01,035
Pops giving me the hard sell
with obsolete tech

221
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,155
that was never cool.

222
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:04,106
You know
what this should say?

223
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,730
This should say,
"Uproot your life.

224
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:08,586
Become
a corporate slave.

225
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:09,835
Love,
your Father.

226
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:13,034
P.S.
Mom misses you."

227
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,771
What?

228
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,275
I don't know.

229
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,066
Maybe the universe
is trying to tell you something.

230
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:23,179
Uh-huh.
I like being my own boss.

231
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:24,298
<i>Max</i> is the boss.

232
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,995
I don't <i>think</i>
he's the boss.

233
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,906
Oh!
That's pretty cool.

234
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,659
I can remote into work
with these.

235
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,931
That's not bad.
Hmm?

236
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,147
Nice?

237
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:37,419
Yeah.
This could work for me.

238
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,306
Ooh.

239
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,834
You look like
an asshole.

240
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,179
Thanks. Oh.

241
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,747
Look,
all I'm saying

242
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,298
is maybe you'd be happier
doing something on your own.

243
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:49,291
No.

244
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:51,786
All I have to do
is sell Max on expansion, okay?

245
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:52,970
Pivot his focus.

246
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:54,122
Max's focus is Max.

247
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,650
You're not
gonna change that.

248
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:58,091
I know this is hard
for you to hear,

249
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:01,482
but Max is using the show
as his meal ticket.

250
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,370
He doesn't care
about the business,

251
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:06,219
he doesn't care about you,
all the work you do.

252
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,442
You're getting played.

253
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:13,162
It's time
to pull the plug.

254
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,675
Dante, what's up?

255
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:24,586
It's, uh, Drew over at
"The Cleansing Hour."

256
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,827
Um, just calling to see
where you are.

257
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,586
Uh, give me...
give me a shout back.

258
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:29,868
Thanks.

259
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,170
Hey, come on.
Riley! Hey!

260
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,451
Delete that shit.
NDA, come on.

261
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,562
Riles, quit fucking around
and give me a hand.

262
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:45,098
What the fuck
are you doing?

263
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:51,722
Beautiful, isn't it?

264
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:08,011
God damn it!

265
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:21,099
Hey, buddy!

266
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,691
I'm looking for
14220 Hughes.

267
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:26,378
"The Cleansing Hour"?

268
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,722
Yeah.

269
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:44,458
Fuck this.

270
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,211
Oh, come on.

271
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:53,292
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

272
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:10,410
City of Angels my ass.

273
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:27,786
Makes you feel any better,
Max isn't here, either.

274
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:31,402
Yeah, well,
I expect <i>him</i> to be late.

275
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:35,019
Ahh.
I'm going to have to cancel.

276
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,226
Fuck.

277
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,938
Not a chance.

278
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,890
Yes, yes, yes!
You were in Drama Club.

279
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:48,586
- Drew.
- You were in Drama Club.

280
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:50,666
Max will have a total conniption
fit if we have to cancel.

281
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:51,979
Please,
it's not worth the fallout.

282
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:55,210
Please,
please, please?

283
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:57,739
Like, I'll literally...
like, please, baby?

284
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:00,235
Please? Please?

285
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:01,866
Please?

286
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,299
I need you
to do this.

287
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:07,690
You better sell
a lot of prayer cloths

288
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:08,875
- because our honeymoon...
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:12,876
...just moved
from Cabo to Bali.

290
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,338
Cool.

291
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,186
Cool.

292
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:21,290
You're
a renaissance woman!

293
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,090
Bryce,
put it away.

294
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,514
So,
how was school today?

295
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,370
Learned about dinosaurs.

296
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:40,682
Ah,
your favorite.

297
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:43,306
What kind?

298
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,090
Triceratops
and pterodactyls.

299
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,459
Ah, cool!
The flying ones, right?

300
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,890
Yeah. Did you know
that their beaks were...

301
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:55,179
One second,
Bryce.

302
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,874
Yes?

303
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:59,179
Can you
give me an hour?

304
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,939
Yep, alright.

305
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:03,947
Sorry, kiddo.
Hold that thought.

306
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,610
I'll be right back.

307
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,019
Jung's cooking is almost
too beautiful to eat,

308
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,778
don't you think,
sweetie?

309
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,059
His nose
is kind of big.

310
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,971
"His nose is kind of big."

311
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,442
"He likes Nickelback."

312
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:28,330
"His hands
are too small."

313
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:32,234
Girl, give a dude a chance...
face-to-face.

314
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,803
Maybe even hip-to-hip.

315
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,179
I have standards.

316
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,866
I'm not just going to
hook up with some rando.

317
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,387
First off,
Father Max ain't no rando.

318
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,754
Second, without me,
you'd never leave the house.

319
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:46,923
And, third, a girl's
got to take charge these days.

320
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:49,995
All these pussy-assed dudes too
scared to buy a girl a drink.

321
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,179
- Hey, what's up?
- Good news!

322
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,363
Dr. Phil's looking for
a priest

323
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,643
to comment
on spiritual matters.

324
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,082
Praise God!

325
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:05,034
You're not thinking
of leaving, though, are you?

326
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:07,211
Don't worry, sinner. Daddy's
just spreading his wings.

327
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:09,067
- Where's Lane?
- Lane, she's... she's...

328
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,211
- Lane! I need her to cover this zit, alright?
- Changing.

329
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:12,682
She's changing. We got
some stuff we got to talk...

330
00:18:12,714 --> 00:18:14,091
- You booked Dante?
- I did.

331
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:15,723
- I've been trying to call him, but I...
- I have to show you.

332
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:17,003
Remember that chick
from the, uh, karaoke bar?

333
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:19,146
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Ah! Ah, yes! Ah!</i>

334
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:20,266
Cool.

335
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,419
- I got a groupie.
- Yeah.

336
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,146
- No, cool.
- I got a disciple.

337
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:24,267
Cool! Awesome!

338
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,515
Here,
here's your script.

339
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,114
What were you trying to say
about tonight's show?

340
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,810
- On in three!
- <i>Max!</i>

341
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,116
<i>Ready for
your blessing?</i>

342
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,043
You alright there,
Chris?

343
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,691
Just late night.

344
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,386
Uh, can you give me
a mike check?

345
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:45,130
Mike check, one, two,
one, two, one, two.

346
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:46,763
Jesus!

347
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:49,227
Oh, my...

348
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,187
Ooh!

349
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:52,874
How about partying
<i>after</i> work, huh?

350
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,674
Go clean yourself up.

351
00:18:57,706 --> 00:18:59,851
Ah,
this is so weird.

352
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:14,826
So, I'm going to talk you
through everything in the IFB.

353
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:15,946
Okay.

354
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:18,762
And I need
to take that.

355
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:21,931
- Okay.
- You sure about this?

356
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:24,715
You know what?
I think I've changed my mind.

357
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:29,003
That's not funny.

358
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,699
Thank you.
Alright.

359
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:34,475
Hey, kid, you want
to see something cool?

360
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,467
Wah!

361
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:38,155
What's
The Devil's Database?

362
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:40,075
This baby right here
is a digital encyclopedia

363
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,706
of every demon
known to man.

364
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:43,019
It's got authentic
character traits,

365
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:46,059
descriptions, history,
it's got exorcism prayers.

366
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:47,851
I mean, it's a work in progress,
but it's actually

367
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:50,474
a hell of a lot easier than
digging through all of that.

368
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,651
Please don't
touch that!

369
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:55,595
You don't stream
in 4K?

370
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,355
That's ghetto.

371
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,307
Yeah, why don't you, uh,
you go stand by your uncle, hmm?

372
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:06,794
Thanks.

373
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:08,939
Careful, please!

374
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:11,019
Please, just...
that's the snake.

375
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:12,490
That's what carries
our signal.

376
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:13,803
Please be careful.

377
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:16,715
Oh, those are
actually called "stingers."

378
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,755
Just FYI.

379
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:25,066
Wow! Laney,
doing stand-in work now.

380
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,379
Look, if you need
a little bit of money,

381
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:28,075
don't be afraid to ask.

382
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,387
Alright, let's get
this thing started.

383
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,754
- Where's my queen?
- You're looking at her.

384
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,554
Drew,
where's Dante?

385
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:37,771
She bailed, man.

386
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,819
No. No, no way.
She's not an actress.

387
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:40,811
She doesn't even know
the lines.

388
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:42,667
It'll be fine. It's what
we have the monitors for.

389
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,106
She looks like
every other possessed chick

390
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:45,355
we've ever had,
alright?

391
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,371
We need shock value,
pizzazz.

392
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:48,235
I'll be fine.

393
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,091
I have to look
at your face for an hour.

394
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,267
It's more than enough
to make a girl homicidal.

395
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,187
Hey, Lane or no-show,
<i>amigo.</i>

396
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,307
You got 10 seconds.

397
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:03,370
Follow the monitors.
Let me lead.

398
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:10,443
Alright, here we go,
and three, two.

399
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:43,755
Good evening, my followers.

400
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:45,771
Welcoming to
"The Cleansing Hour."

401
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,083
I'm Father Max, your guide

402
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:49,643
and faithful servant
in a fallen world.

403
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,779
Follow me on
social @FatherMaxTCH.

404
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,739
Cleansing Hour.

405
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,331
Max, come on, you got to...
@CleansingHour.

406
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:59,147
Tonight, we bring you Sabrina,

407
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:01,387
a tortured soul
from a broken home,

408
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,875
molested by her stepfather,
beaten by her mother.

409
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,883
Sabrina escaped her pain
through drugs, alcohol,

410
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:10,891
and, ultimately,
prostitution.

411
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:13,547
The enemy of God
exploited her frailty

412
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:14,859
and took control of her body,

413
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:18,507
but tonight, with your prayers
and my leadership,

414
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,619
Sabrina will be rid
of this evil.

415
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:25,291
The molested ones
are always jacked.

416
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:29,738
Yeah, she gonna
flip a dick.

417
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,058
Alright, Lane, now writhe
for me a little bit

418
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:48,491
like there's an itch
you can't scratch.

419
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:51,243
Good, good, good.

420
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:53,962
Now, it feels like
there's something menacing

421
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:55,307
creeping inside of you.

422
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:56,875
It's like
a feeling you dread,

423
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:59,851
like a start
of a bad dream.

424
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:03,467
And line.

425
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:05,739
Help me, Father Max.

426
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:06,859
Please.

427
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,779
I can feel it.

428
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,411
It's inside of me.

429
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,299
That's good,
that's good.

430
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:17,835
Just like that.
Keep your head down.

431
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,755
What they can't see
will terrify them.

432
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:21,259
Alright, Max,
let's work in the merch.

433
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,699
Tonight, my child,

434
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:24,843
you will witness
the healing power of prayer,

435
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,602
both by my utterance

436
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:28,651
and holy linen
from the Vatican.

437
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,707
Lord have mercy
on us.

438
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:35,945
Christ have mercy
on us.

439
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,865
Lord have mercy
on us.

440
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,339
Lights.

441
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,675
This demon already manifests
electromagnetic disturbances.

442
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:50,667
We could be dealing with
a Stage Four possession.

443
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,683
I command
the unclean spirit,

444
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:55,179
by the mysteries
of the incarnation,

445
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:57,770
passion, resurrection,
and ascension.

446
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,387
You tell me your name
and obey me to the letter.

447
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:07,178
Your name, demon.
Speak!

448
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,019
My God!

449
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,226
You're a natural.

450
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:21,578
Tell me your name.

451
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:24,939
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

452
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,603
Boom, Chris.
Chris?

453
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:28,298
We're seeing the boom.

454
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,138
You said
you were fine.

455
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,259
Get up, now!

456
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,626
What the fuck
is that thing?

457
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:37,386
Max, Max, Max!
Get back on camera.

458
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:38,827
Riley, get the boom.

459
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:44,618
Chris, splash some water on
your face and sober the fuck up!

460
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:50,155
Okay.

461
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:52,779
Okay, keep it together.

462
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:55,211
You just took some bad shit.

463
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,666
This'll pass.

464
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:18,155
What? What?

465
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:28,939
Holy shit, what?

466
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,602
What, what, what?

467
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:41,035
Abhorrent slime of hell,
give me your name!

468
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:44,138
Alright, baby,
that's your cue. Paimon.

469
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:50,027
This demon has no respect
for God's authority.

470
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:56,331
Perhaps a larger dose of holy
water will force compliance.

471
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:18,698
Hey, Lane, uh,
Max is better on script, babe,

472
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:22,122
so why don't you... don't you
just follow his lead?

473
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:23,275
Speak, child.

474
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:25,418
What is
the demon telling you?

475
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,498
This is tight.

476
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,739
What was that?

477
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,011
Louder, my dear.

478
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,027
This is tight.

479
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:38,602
It's okay.

480
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:40,938
You can whisper it
to me.

481
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,698
This is tight.

482
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:48,139
Shit, Lane,
what are you doing?

483
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:50,378
Max,
are you alright?

484
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:52,075
No, no, no, Max!

485
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,354
Max, we're live.
We're live.

486
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:55,659
Breathe.
Just breathe, man.

487
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:01,706
You will submit to me
before the cross of our Lord!

488
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:03,947
Tell me your name,
worm of Gehenna!

489
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:07,146
Tell me your name.

490
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:11,019
I'm gonna make you
work for it, Maxi.

491
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,418
What did
you just call me?

492
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:18,251
Lane,
what's, uh, going on?

493
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:20,203
Tommy, come here.

494
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:22,635
What are you doing?

495
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:25,898
I don't know, man,
just go with it.

496
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:28,330
Lane, if this is about me
leaving dishes in the sink,

497
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:29,867
there's a better way
to get back at me.

498
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:37,035
Nice ink.

499
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:40,138
What are you,
some kind of tough guy?

500
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,866
Um...

501
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,234
I'm not really qualified
to address demons.

502
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:47,595
That's best left
to the professionals, right?

503
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:50,731
Mm,
birds of a feather.

504
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:35,499
Is there
a French flag emoji?

505
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:44,395
What? Man, what the fuck?
What the fuck?

506
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:50,218
Looks like the show's
got some heat, Maxi.

507
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:53,035
Time to go
off script.

508
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,626
Somebody, please, help!

509
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,284
This is very real!
We're at 14220...

510
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:03,658
Drop out.
Drew!

511
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:08,522
Tonight, Father, you'll have
a chance to save your own soul.

512
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:12,619
If you don't, I'll kill
sweet little Sabrina here

513
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:16,331
in a way that makes Tommy's
death look like euthanasia.

514
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:19,882
Drew, cut the feed at any point,
I kill the girl.

515
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:24,139
Max, you step off set
at any point, I kill the girl.

516
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:27,435
Anyone tries to run...

517
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,546
I'll kill you.

518
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:33,482
You have 49 minutes
to lift the veil.

519
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,066
Oh, help me, please!

520
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,819
Get me out of here!

521
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,706
Drew! Drew!

522
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:42,826
Ah, ah, ah!

523
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,042
What the fuck?

524
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,699
It's only Max
in the limelight now.

525
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,586
You step on set
and she dies.

526
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:54,762
Let her go,
scum of Hell!

527
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,026
She doesn't deserve this.
Take me instead.

528
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:03,211
Do you really
mean that, Maxi?

529
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:06,411
Do you really want to see
what she sees

530
00:30:06,443 --> 00:30:10,058
and feel
what she feels?

531
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:13,131
This is the defining moment
of your life.

532
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:16,651
Do penance
or become a martyr.

533
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:22,571
So...
do you want me?

534
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:28,042
- Okay.
- Why are you here?

535
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:30,348
To see
if you're a bona fide saint

536
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:32,011
or a whitewash,
too.

537
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:32,971
What?

538
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:34,795
You fuck
with the bull,

539
00:30:34,826 --> 00:30:37,099
you'll eventually
get the horns.

540
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:43,626
Summon it now,
demon!

541
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:46,219
- It's not gonna work.
- The God's word.

542
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,074
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not...

543
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:49,899
Max, that's not
gonna work!

544
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,146
Yea, though I walk
through the valley of...

545
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:52,746
Max, it's not
gonna work!

546
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,922
You can't just read
random Bible verses.

547
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,323
There's specific rites
for each demon.

548
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:02,379
We need its name.

549
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,459
Yeah. Yeah.

550
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,506
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

551
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:09,418
I command you
to tell me your name!

552
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,139
Your fans
deserve better.

553
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,531
Alright, loyal followers,
you decide.

554
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:19,882
How should Father Max
#SaveSabrina?

555
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:23,818
Your wish
is his command.

556
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,394
You had
your chance.

557
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:30,186
You know
we could have shared him.

558
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:31,435
I'm a good girl.

559
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:33,579
Oh,
you a freak-a-leek.

560
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:34,699
Yeah.

561
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:38,379
My friends,
this isn't a game.

562
00:31:38,412 --> 00:31:41,387
It's a battle between good
and evil, life and death!

563
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,922
I need prayers.

564
00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:46,570
I need wholesome thoughts.

565
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:47,947
Whatever happened to,

566
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:49,899
"With your prayers
and my leadership,

567
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:53,258
Sabrina will be rid
of this evil."

568
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,506
Max,
I got an idea.

569
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,643
Keep this asshole talking,
get more info.

570
00:31:57,675 --> 00:31:58,986
How do I do that?

571
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:02,315
Do what you do best, man...
bullshit.

572
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,066
You talk a big game

573
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:06,762
for someone
who picks on an innocent girl.

574
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,010
Nobody's innocent.

575
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:10,762
You're a bully, a coward
who picks on the weak.

576
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:11,882
This isn't why
people tune in.

577
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:14,410
They tune in
to see good prevail,

578
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:16,011
to see
your kind defeated.

579
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:17,515
So, defeat me.

580
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:20,138
Forgive them, Lord,
they know not what they do.

581
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,418
God made them
this way.

582
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,210
Must be
part of his plan.

583
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,396
What do you know
of God's plan,

584
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:25,866
other than
how to corrupt it?

585
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:32,107
I was there
when he wrote it.

586
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:34,251
That's great, Max.
That's great, that's great.

587
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:36,012
Keep it up.

588
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:37,963
Time's up!

589
00:32:37,995 --> 00:32:40,394
Drew,
what's it gonna be?

590
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,379
We're up a creek, man,

591
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:52,427
and we got everything
from disgusting to illegal here.

592
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:56,010
And there's no way
I'm letting you touch Lane.

593
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:59,850
Most innocent suggestion...

594
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,987
...strip.

595
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:05,354
There's got to be
something else. Come on, man.

596
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,699
I don't know.

597
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:08,811
- Shirt off.
- No.

598
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,731
I won't do it.
No!

599
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:12,330
Then the girl dies.

600
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:14,826
Hey, it's fine. I'm going to
keep you in a tight shot.

601
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:16,331
Nobody's going to
see anything.

602
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:48,779
What is going on?

603
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,596
I'm not doing that.
I'm not doing that, Max.

604
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:58,379
I'm not doing that.

605
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,587
Oh,
proof there is a God.

606
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:02,539
Mm-hmm.

607
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:11,115
Um, hey!

608
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:19,787
Alright,
you had your fun.

609
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:21,098
Hardly.

610
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:42,667
You know the moves.

611
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:04,458
Come on!

612
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,619
Sabrina and half a million
viewers are counting on you.

613
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:11,563
Show some enthusiasm.

614
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,642
Okay.

615
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:47,018
Oh,
that's so cool!

616
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,026
What on earth
is this devilry?

617
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:53,195
You might as well call upon
Satan directly.

618
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:55,690
Not in my classroom!

619
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:02,059
The Act of Contrition,
Andrew.

620
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,651
Oh my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

621
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,699
I detest all my sins because of
thy just punishments,

622
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:08,363
but most of all
because they offend thee.

623
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,667
My God, who art all good
and deserving of all my love,

624
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:13,898
I firmly resolve with the help
of they grace to sin no more

625
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,818
and avoid
the near occasion of sin.

626
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,355
Maxi.

627
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:24,587
My God,
I'm sorry...

628
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,378
<i>Heartily</i> sorry.
Again.

629
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,298
My God,
I'm heartily sorry because...

630
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,507
For having offended you.
Again!

631
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:33,707
My God, I detest
all my sins.

632
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:35,690
Again!

633
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,963
Well,
you didn't save Sabrina...

634
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:48,715
but you certainly
drew a crowd.

635
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:52,875
Oh, my God, Max!
We need to see.

636
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:04,746
You alright?

637
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:06,698
Yeah.

638
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,715
We got to figure out
which demon this is

639
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:09,931
and what it wants.

640
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:11,883
Clearly, it wants
to make a fool out of me.

641
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:12,715
No, no, no.

642
00:38:12,747 --> 00:38:14,763
No, there's got to be
a bigger play.

643
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:17,483
Either way, it's gonna kill Lane
if we don't hurry.

644
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:22,187
Basustai...
maybe that's something?

645
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:27,083
Before it headbutted you,
it said, "Basustai."

646
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:29,835
I studied ancient languages
in prep school.

647
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:36,715
It means "lies."

648
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,859
Demons lie.
No shit.

649
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:41,515
Well, that's something.
Riley, good job.

650
00:38:41,547 --> 00:38:44,202
Max,
you can use that.

651
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,011
You can use it.

652
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,387
Come on!

653
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,931
I am willing to do
your bidding.

654
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,627
Lie for you.

655
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:03,755
Just tell me what you want
so we can end this.

656
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:06,475
Maybe I already have.

657
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,147
Don't listen to it!

658
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:13,419
Shut up, bitch!

659
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:17,387
Drew!

660
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:19,211
Lane,
talk to me, baby.

661
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:20,842
It wants...

662
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,210
I'll snap your neck like a twig.

663
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,435
She's fighting back.
She's fighting back.

664
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,355
Come on, Lane, fight, babe!
Come on!

665
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:37,451
It won't let me.

666
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,786
She's... She's choking.

667
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:40,939
She's choking!
She's choking!

668
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:42,347
She's choking, Max!
She's choking!

669
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,978
- I mean, what do I do?
- I can do the Heimlich

670
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:45,707
if you could just
get her out of the chair.

671
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:47,978
- No, it could be a trap.
- Come on, stop talking about it!

672
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:51,050
She's gonna die.
Fucking do something!

673
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,522
Max!

674
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:55,146
Alright, alright! Riley,
hold her head. Hold her head.

675
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:57,387
I'm gonna clear
the airway.

676
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:02,507
I feel something.
I feel something.

677
00:40:04,075 --> 00:40:06,155
Fuck,
she's turning blue, man.

678
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,506
Here, I got it.
I got it.

679
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:12,715
Pull it out!
Pull it out!

680
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:17,515
What the fuck is that?

681
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,099
What?

682
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,307
Hey, baby, you alright?
You alright?

683
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:30,187
- Cut the feed.
- Can't, babe, it will kill you.

684
00:40:30,218 --> 00:40:34,091
You have to.

685
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:36,459
It's one of ours.

686
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:38,954
It's one of ours.

687
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,386
I-I don't get it,
man.

688
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:42,667
Oh, my God!

689
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:49,514
Basustai, ba-basustai, basustai.

690
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,746
Max, Max, it wants us to
tell the truth about the merch.

691
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:55,978
- What?
- Call it a hunch, man.

692
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:01,579
Oh.

693
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:03,979
I will not sully my good name
based on a hunch, okay?

694
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,538
- I won't do it anymore.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

695
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:08,587
The woman that I love
is fucking dying

696
00:41:08,618 --> 00:41:10,507
and you're worried
about staying in character?

697
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:11,627
You shut the fuck up!

698
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:14,539
You tell the truth, or I swear
to God, I fucking will.

699
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,746
Go.

700
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:17,899
Go!

701
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:19,339
This better work.

702
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:32,139
My friend...

703
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:35,115
I have something
that's been weighing

704
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:36,906
heavily on my heart.

705
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:39,275
You see, the prayer cloths...

706
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,962
See, the prayer cloths...

707
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:48,586
they have no healing power,
okay?

708
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,898
They're not even
from the Vatican.

709
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:51,818
They're just
some cheap crap from China.

710
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:55,531
It's working. It's working.
It's fucking working.

711
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:57,355
And the holy water is just...

712
00:41:57,387 --> 00:41:59,946
it's from my bathroom sink.

713
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:01,930
Alright?

714
00:42:01,962 --> 00:42:04,075
But, okay, but understand,
alright?

715
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,666
It wasn't my idea, alright?
My producer...

716
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:09,675
Max!
Max, the truth, man!

717
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,114
Yeah, okay, okay!

718
00:42:11,147 --> 00:42:13,771
I knew better, alright,
and I went with it all along.

719
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:17,451
The love of money
is the root of evil,

720
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:21,066
<i>and I fell prey
to the temptation.</i>

721
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:23,563
I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed.

722
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:26,507
But, please, forgive me.

723
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:30,955
Lane, hey, baby. Hey, baby.
Lane, are you alright?

724
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:33,579
- I want to go home.
- I know you do.

725
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,722
I know you do. I know you do.
I want to get you home.

726
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:37,579
Think about those
crystal-clear waters

727
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:38,858
and white powder beaches
in Bali, baby.

728
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:40,811
Come on,
we're gonna be there soon.

729
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,411
No, God, fuck!
Come on!

730
00:42:46,442 --> 00:42:49,195
- Come on!
- I told you, man! I fucking told you!

731
00:42:49,227 --> 00:42:52,746
Just shut up!
Check her fucking throat!

732
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,051
Oh, my God!
Max. Max!

733
00:42:55,082 --> 00:42:56,938
I'm trying!
I'm trying! I'm trying!

734
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:58,091
Come on.

735
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,467
Fuck!

736
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:37,322
Max, it's not after
your confession.

737
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:38,859
It's after mine.

738
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,298
For the last year,

739
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:43,626
I've been keeping
the lion's share of the profits.

740
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:49,931
60%. 70%.

741
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:53,867
Look, this whole fucking show
runs because of me.

742
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,818
I get here early,
I stay late.

743
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:58,986
All you have to do
is show up.

744
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,995
That's how I rationalize
keeping the money.

745
00:44:03,946 --> 00:44:06,666
I'm sorry,
man.

746
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:10,251
It's okay, my son.

747
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:12,938
I forgive you.

748
00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:23,562
You're paying me back
with interest.

749
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:28,810
Fuck this!

750
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:44,266
I'll call someone.

751
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:46,122
No, I got this.

752
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:48,651
Loose hose,
I think.

753
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:50,986
Maybe the brake line?

754
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:53,098
Maybe the driver.

755
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,708
Oh, fuck.
This is gonna hurt, bud.

756
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:17,451
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

757
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:18,955
I can do it.
I can do it!

758
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:21,579
Hey!
Do you want to bleed out?

759
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,915
Do you want
to bleed out?

760
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:25,419
Come on.

761
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:34,411
So many sins,
so little time.

762
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:42,348
Did you hear that?

763
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:44,138
Hear what?

764
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,139
You'd make
a great nurse.

765
00:45:48,171 --> 00:45:50,858
Yeah?
You'd make a pretty corpse.

766
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,106
Boy Scouts.

767
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:59,306
First Aid merit badge.

768
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:00,939
That's right.

769
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:06,122
You did mine
for me.

770
00:46:06,155 --> 00:46:06,955
I did. I did.

771
00:46:06,986 --> 00:46:09,579
So we'd make Eagle Scouts
together.

772
00:46:11,243 --> 00:46:14,410
What am I gonna do,
man?

773
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:16,875
What am I gonna do?

774
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,578
This thing knows us.

775
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:23,275
All our sins.

776
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:25,899
We confess,
we live.

777
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,042
- Confess what?
- I don't know.

778
00:46:28,075 --> 00:46:30,218
We got to listen
for more clues.

779
00:46:32,938 --> 00:46:33,931
Shit!

780
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:37,068
Shit, shit,
shit, shit!

781
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,410
Oh, shit.

782
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:40,426
Max,
we're losing signal.

783
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:42,250
We got major loss.

784
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:43,402
I think the servers
must be overwhelmed

785
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:44,652
from all the viewers.

786
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:46,346
So, fix it.

787
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:53,388
- Oh, no.
- Hey, what's the Wi-Fi password?

788
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:56,650
What is going on?

789
00:46:56,682 --> 00:46:58,922
Give me
some good news, Drew.

790
00:46:58,955 --> 00:47:02,474
I suppose it's time
to say goodbye

791
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:05,868
to the audience
and to your friends.

792
00:47:10,186 --> 00:47:12,202
Oh, my God.

793
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:14,508
What happened
to your hand?

794
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,922
It's local.
It's local, it's local.

795
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:26,666
Drew!

796
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:27,786
Oh, shit.

797
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:28,939
Where's he going?

798
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,923
He's going to
fix the signal.

799
00:47:30,955 --> 00:47:32,747
The feed's
about to drop.

800
00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:34,154
Don't do it!

801
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,338
Let it go!

802
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,866
I'm not gonna let you die.

803
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:38,986
Oh, shit.

804
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:40,970
Please,
come back.

805
00:47:41,002 --> 00:47:42,890
Just be here with me
when it happens.

806
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:45,995
Stop it, Lane!
You don't want to die.

807
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,755
There's a bigger plan here,
Drew.

808
00:47:50,762 --> 00:47:52,298
Let me out.

809
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,595
Yeah, I might just
give you a hand.

810
00:47:55,627 --> 00:47:57,322
Please, Max.

811
00:47:57,355 --> 00:47:59,467
Yeah, you think I'm gonna
really fall for that?

812
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:01,322
- Max.
- Huh?

813
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:02,507
It's me.

814
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:05,355
- Ah!
- It's Lane.

815
00:48:05,387 --> 00:48:09,227
Please!

816
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:03,723
I saw it.

817
00:49:03,756 --> 00:49:05,610
What?

818
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:09,611
The beast.

819
00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:12,587
I love you, Drew.

820
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:50,923
Good job, buddy.

821
00:49:52,747 --> 00:49:54,250
Chris! Hey!

822
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,627
Wake up!

823
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,811
Wake up!

824
00:49:56,843 --> 00:49:58,539
I'm sorry, man.
I fucked up.

825
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:00,202
What are you talking about?
Sorry for what?

826
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:01,866
I'll never be high
at work again, I swear.

827
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,276
I don't give a shit right now.
Look at me.

828
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:04,746
You may be able
to save us.

829
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:07,211
I need you to tell me
what you saw.

830
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:08,906
Save us?

831
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,602
From what?

832
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:22,314
Tell them the truth.

833
00:50:22,347 --> 00:50:25,162
...now and at the hour
of our death.

834
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:26,187
Amen.

835
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:28,874
Very good,
Andrew.

836
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:32,874
Holy Mother delivers us
from all peril.

837
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:35,594
Maxi?

838
00:50:35,626 --> 00:50:38,346
You can do it.

839
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:51,339
Hail Mary,
full of grace.

840
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:55,211
Don't help him,
you miserable cheat!

841
00:50:55,243 --> 00:50:57,738
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

842
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,498
- Shut up!
- Blessed art thou among women...

843
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,035
- Stop it!
- Stop it! You're hurting him!

844
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:04,011
- ...fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
- Oh, you little wretch.

845
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:05,867
You must learn
some respect.

846
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:07,338
Stop it!
You're hurting him!

847
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,258
- Don't! He's my friend!
- Shut up!

848
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,178
Blessed art thou
among women...

849
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,483
Stop! Stop it!
Stop it! No!

850
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:14,858
Maxi?

851
00:51:22,187 --> 00:51:24,139
Hey! Get out of it!
Pull it together!

852
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:25,675
Look at me.
Look at me!

853
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,659
Focus!
Take a breath.

854
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:31,627
You said you saw a beast
in the chair, right?

855
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:32,747
Describe it to me.

856
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:34,315
Fucking scary,
man.

857
00:51:34,347 --> 00:51:37,547
No shit!
What did it look like?

858
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:41,259
Ah, Drew!
Look out!

859
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,443
What the fuck?

860
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:43,915
That's it!

861
00:51:43,947 --> 00:51:46,283
Pull your shit together
or we're going to fucking die!

862
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:49,003
- Do you understand me?!
- Yeah.

863
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:52,043
Okay.

864
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,443
Okay, I'm cool.

865
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:58,635
It was like a bird or something
with fangs and shit.

866
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:00,459
Good.
What else?

867
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:01,898
A-A hairy body.

868
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,882
Kind of like a dog.

869
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:06,251
And a big-ass tail,
like a big snake.

870
00:52:06,283 --> 00:52:07,403
Arms, legs?

871
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:10,251
I don't know, uh,
part man, part goat.

872
00:52:10,283 --> 00:52:12,715
- Ugly shit.
- Okay. Okay. Good.

873
00:52:12,747 --> 00:52:14,378
Hey,
what else can I do?!

874
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,595
Just you stay here.

875
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:18,186
Oh, no, no!
Don't leave me here!

876
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:21,098
Alright.
Max, I got some good news.

877
00:52:29,387 --> 00:52:30,955
Check the monitor.

878
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:58,250
It's not real.

879
00:52:58,283 --> 00:52:59,787
It's not real.

880
00:52:59,818 --> 00:53:01,099
It's just your imagination.

881
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,859
It's not real.

882
00:53:05,035 --> 00:53:07,531
Oh, it's not real.

883
00:53:16,107 --> 00:53:18,987
Get off! Get off!
Get off! Get off!

884
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,850
What?!

885
00:53:31,883 --> 00:53:33,323
There's something
in there.

886
00:53:33,355 --> 00:53:34,443
You guys
have got to help me.

887
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:36,107
Let's get
out of here. Hide!

888
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:38,155
Hey! Hey!
Relax, there's nothing there.

889
00:53:38,187 --> 00:53:40,490
What the hell
is going on?!

890
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:41,835
What is it,
man?

891
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:44,363
Yes, Chris,
describe them for us.

892
00:53:44,395 --> 00:53:46,667
Nancy Drew will
tell us their names.

893
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:48,555
Okay,
you shut the fuck up!

894
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:54,315
Oh, God!

895
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:57,098
- Oh, oh! Oh, oh! Oh my God!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

896
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,115
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You mean you guys aren't seeing this?

897
00:54:01,547 --> 00:54:02,826
Take it easy, man.
Hey!

898
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:04,490
What the fuck
is that?!

899
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,843
- Don't let them get me, man!
- Chris!

900
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,187
Don't let them get me!
Don't let them fucking get me!

901
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:11,851
Chris!

902
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:12,651
Hey, hey, Max!

903
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,090
You got to confess something,
man.

904
00:54:14,123 --> 00:54:15,979
Anything.

905
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,242
I-I took
offering money once.

906
00:54:19,275 --> 00:54:21,162
I-I...

907
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:24,171
I hit my neighbor's car
and I didn't leave a note.

908
00:54:24,203 --> 00:54:25,930
I don't know,
man!

909
00:54:36,715 --> 00:54:39,435
Hey!
What the fuck are you doing?

910
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:41,739
What the fuck
are you doing?

911
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:45,739
Our Holy Mother delivers us
from all peril.

912
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:51,467
You got to pray
with me.

913
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:53,771
Come here.

914
00:54:53,802 --> 00:54:55,787
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

915
00:54:55,819 --> 00:54:57,003
Blessed are thou
amongst women,

916
00:54:57,035 --> 00:54:59,243
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

917
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:00,715
Holy Mary,
Mother of God,

918
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:03,979
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

919
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,387
- Amen.
- Yeah.

920
00:55:05,419 --> 00:55:07,371
You got to say,
"Amen."

921
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:08,619
Amen.

922
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:18,379
It worked.

923
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,755
It worked.

924
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:21,802
It worked, man!
It worked!

925
00:55:25,707 --> 00:55:29,771
Friends, never underestimate
the power of prayer.

926
00:55:29,803 --> 00:55:32,139
Or the power
of denial.

927
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:42,699
- Chris!
- Oh, no, get him off me!

928
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:45,707
Chris!

929
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:47,499
No, no, Chris!
Don't! Chris! Chris!

930
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:49,994
- Chris! Chris!
- Oh, shit!

931
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:54,538
No, no! Chris!

932
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:55,658
God, stop!

933
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:57,803
Knock it the fuck off!

934
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:07,659
- Chris!
- Fuck!

935
00:56:17,899 --> 00:56:20,587
<i>Don't do drugs, kids.</i>

936
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:29,995
I don't get it.

937
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:31,819
I prayed.

938
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:34,187
I got every word right.

939
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:39,371
My patience and your time
are running out.

940
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:41,226
What do you want
from me?!

941
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:43,850
Ahh.

942
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:58,635
You want me
to kill myself.

943
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:02,027
I want you
to unburden your conscience.

944
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:06,763
Since your value
your public perception

945
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:09,195
more than human life,

946
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:10,986
let us once again

947
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:14,059
let the viewers
decide your fate.

948
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:18,666
You can keep your life
if you keep it 100.

949
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:21,931
Do they have the heart
to save you?

950
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:31,339
Okay.

951
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:32,427
Hey.

952
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:35,435
Just remember
why people watch.

953
00:57:37,131 --> 00:57:38,507
Alright,
it's for your charm,

954
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,483
it's for your bravery,
and for your good looks.

955
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,915
Just give them
what they want.

956
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:49,898
You can do it...

957
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:51,595
Father Max.

958
00:58:13,802 --> 00:58:17,547
I have faith in my followers.

959
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,531
Fuck.

960
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,643
Get your phone.
Get your phone!

961
00:58:23,563 --> 00:58:25,866
My loyal followers,

962
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:29,739
I stand before you
a defeated man.

963
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,875
After countless victories
over evil...

964
00:58:32,907 --> 00:58:34,922
I think I've met my match.

965
00:58:38,698 --> 00:58:41,386
A force has overpowered me...

966
00:58:41,419 --> 00:58:42,858
<i>murdered my crew.</i>

967
00:58:44,714 --> 00:58:48,235
My friends.

968
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:53,258
Now it looks like I'm next,
unless you have mercy on me.

969
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:01,098
Hey, keep going.

970
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:21,771
Keep going.

971
00:59:21,802 --> 00:59:23,978
What are you looking at?
Focus!

972
00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:29,611
I'm a sinner.

973
00:59:29,642 --> 00:59:30,924
We all are.

974
00:59:30,955 --> 00:59:33,451
But do we deserve to die for it?

975
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:39,786
What makes us... human?

976
00:59:43,786 --> 00:59:48,043
Tell them the truth,
Maxi.

977
00:59:48,074 --> 00:59:50,987
Cast the first stone.

978
00:59:56,139 --> 01:00:00,970
God hates
disobedient children.

979
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:03,275
Love the sinner, hate the sin.

980
01:00:03,307 --> 01:00:05,162
- My God, I'm sorry.
- Heartily sorry!

981
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:07,722
You're a stupid
little boy.

982
01:00:07,755 --> 01:00:09,067
My God,
I'm heartily sorry.

983
01:00:09,098 --> 01:00:10,058
Again!

984
01:00:10,091 --> 01:00:11,595
Again!

985
01:00:12,971 --> 01:00:15,306
Go on, Max.

986
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:16,044
You can do it.

987
01:00:16,075 --> 01:00:17,004
Go on, Maxi.

988
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:19,691
Lie to them again.

989
01:00:19,722 --> 01:00:20,778
- Again!
- Stop!

990
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:22,059
- The Lord is with me.
- Again!

991
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,467
I detest all my sins.

992
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:24,395
- Again!
- No!

993
01:00:24,427 --> 01:00:25,930
I don't want to die.

994
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:27,050
Again!

995
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:29,258
- You can do it.
- Again.

996
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:30,379
Again!

997
01:00:34,762 --> 01:00:40,266
I can't!

998
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:42,891
It's alright.

999
01:00:42,924 --> 01:00:45,066
Just go with your gut.

1000
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:53,739
<i>I'm a phony. I'm a fraud.</i>

1001
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:56,586
<i>Everything you think
you know about me is just...</i>

1002
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:57,675
<i>made up.</i>

1003
01:00:57,706 --> 01:00:59,499
<i>It's part of a character.</i>

1004
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,475
<i>"The Cleansing Hour"...</i>

1005
01:01:02,506 --> 01:01:04,682
every episode is just a hoax.

1006
01:01:04,715 --> 01:01:05,868
<i>It's a big act.</i>

1007
01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:12,170
Except for tonight.

1008
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:15,371
Isn't that obvious by now?

1009
01:01:15,402 --> 01:01:17,739
I'm no priest.

1010
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,018
What?

1011
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,194
<i>I was.</i>

1012
01:01:21,228 --> 01:01:23,722
I was raised Roman Catholic,

1013
01:01:23,755 --> 01:01:26,124
and they say,
"If you want to do right by God,

1014
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:28,395
you got to follow the rules."

1015
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:30,250
"Do this, don't do that.

1016
01:01:30,282 --> 01:01:31,242
Recite this prayer.

1017
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,066
Sit. Stand. Kneel."

1018
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:36,458
I... I was never good at it.

1019
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:39,082
I was kind of a dumb kid,

1020
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:42,315
but it doesn't take smarts...

1021
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:45,098
to know what evil is,

1022
01:01:45,131 --> 01:01:47,946
and hell if I wasn't
gonna stand up to her.

1023
01:01:47,978 --> 01:01:49,515
Stop it!
You're hurting him!

1024
01:01:49,546 --> 01:01:51,306
Stop! He's my friend!

1025
01:01:52,682 --> 01:01:53,931
- Stop! Stop it!
- Stop it!

1026
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:56,106
Shut up, you little wretch.

1027
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:58,026
You miserable cheat!

1028
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:26,859
She haunted me for years,

1029
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:30,155
through high school, college.

1030
01:02:30,186 --> 01:02:32,268
I just chalked it up

1031
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:34,986
to God punishing me

1032
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,586
for what I had done.

1033
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,370
Order up!

1034
01:02:40,586 --> 01:02:42,828
<i>That's why I went
into seminary.</i>

1035
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:47,275
<i>Got ordained,
thinking maybe, somehow,</i>

1036
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:48,651
<i>if I just devoted my life</i>

1037
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:52,235
<i>to following God's rules,
he'd forgive me.</i>

1038
01:02:52,266 --> 01:02:54,411
But I'm...

1039
01:02:54,443 --> 01:02:56,203
<i>The closer I got to the Church,</i>

1040
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:58,826
<i>the more hypocrisy
and corruption that I saw.</i>

1041
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,715
The so-called keys to Heaven

1042
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:02,955
were being held
by perverts and con men,

1043
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,738
the very evil I wanted to fight.

1044
01:03:05,772 --> 01:03:08,170
What kind of God

1045
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,668
would allow that scandal?

1046
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:13,930
<i>So, I quit the Church,</i>

1047
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:15,786
<i>quit believing in their lies.</i>

1048
01:03:15,819 --> 01:03:18,026
<i>Figured that there's no God,</i>

1049
01:03:18,058 --> 01:03:20,203
<i>so I could live
by my own rules...</i>

1050
01:03:20,235 --> 01:03:23,211
<i>pick on somebody else.</i>

1051
01:03:23,243 --> 01:03:25,642
<i>Who?</i>

1052
01:03:30,732 --> 01:03:32,426
<i>All I ever knew was
religious rituals,</i>

1053
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,154
<i>labelism, and prayers.</i>

1054
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:37,034
<i>So...</i>

1055
01:03:37,066 --> 01:03:41,387
So, me and my best friend...

1056
01:03:41,419 --> 01:03:43,243
we started this show.

1057
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:48,554
I didn't think
it mattered it was fake.

1058
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:51,338
People loved it.

1059
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,739
People loved me.

1060
01:03:59,146 --> 01:04:01,066
Once again...

1061
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:04,874
there's blood on my hands...

1062
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,922
because of my foolishness.

1063
01:04:06,955 --> 01:04:09,706
<i>I don't deserve it.</i>

1064
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:12,426
<i>I beg of you...</i>

1065
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,963
please...

1066
01:04:13,995 --> 01:04:16,875
forgive me for what I've done.

1067
01:04:20,779 --> 01:04:22,186
Looks like a Hail Mary

1068
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:25,356
couldn't save you
this time either, Maxi!

1069
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:31,626
But I told them everything.

1070
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:33,739
Mobs don't care
about the truth.

1071
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,147
I won't do it!

1072
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:36,554
If you want me dead,

1073
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:38,378
you're gonna have
to do it yourself!

1074
01:04:43,178 --> 01:04:45,066
Lane? Lane! Lane!

1075
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:46,282
Lane!

1076
01:04:46,314 --> 01:04:48,010
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

1077
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:49,452
Lane, no!

1078
01:04:49,483 --> 01:04:51,307
No!

1079
01:04:51,339 --> 01:04:53,130
No! No!

1080
01:04:53,163 --> 01:04:54,219
No! No!

1081
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:56,586
I'm sorry.

1082
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,939
No! No!

1083
01:05:02,091 --> 01:05:03,690
No! No! No!

1084
01:05:04,812 --> 01:05:05,867
No!

1085
01:05:05,899 --> 01:05:07,530
No!

1086
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,074
Stop!

1087
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,842
Stop!

1088
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:27,883
Drew?

1089
01:05:27,915 --> 01:05:29,226
Drew?

1090
01:05:30,795 --> 01:05:31,723
Wait, baby!

1091
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:33,162
Lane, hey.

1092
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:34,667
Hey, talk to me.

1093
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:37,291
It's okay.
I'm listening.

1094
01:05:39,595 --> 01:05:41,706
It's okay.
You're okay.

1095
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:43,116
Talk to me.

1096
01:05:46,762 --> 01:05:48,843
You're getting played.

1097
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:03,050
You're getting played.

1098
01:06:03,082 --> 01:06:04,427
It's time
to pull the plug.

1099
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:08,586
Let him go, motherfucker,
or I'll cut the cameras.

1100
01:06:08,618 --> 01:06:10,891
don't!
It'll kill her!

1101
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:12,619
It won't.
It needs a vessel.

1102
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:13,931
It needs a vessel.
It needs you.

1103
01:06:13,963 --> 01:06:15,756
It needs the confessions.
It needs the torture.

1104
01:06:15,787 --> 01:06:17,322
'Cause it's all
to drive up viewership,

1105
01:06:17,354 --> 01:06:18,571
Isn't that right?!

1106
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:20,491
Flex your muscles
in front of a crowd.

1107
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:25,066
Demon defeats priest,
cosmic fucking payback.

1108
01:06:25,098 --> 01:06:29,131
No? Nothing?
okay, how about this?

1109
01:06:29,163 --> 01:06:32,139
Boom! There you go.
Dead air!

1110
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:35,787
Nobody gives a shit what you do
to us if they can't see it.

1111
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:51,339
Ah, ah!
Ah, ah, ah!

1112
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:53,291
Come on.

1113
01:06:53,323 --> 01:06:54,955
Come on, come on!

1114
01:07:00,203 --> 01:07:01,514
Come on.

1115
01:07:08,747 --> 01:07:10,635
Thank God! Yes!

1116
01:07:13,898 --> 01:07:16,970
Clever little bitch,
isn't she?

1117
01:07:17,002 --> 01:07:19,083
Now restore the picture.

1118
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:20,746
No!

1119
01:07:20,778 --> 01:07:22,923
You're in no position
to bargain.

1120
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,490
The only way
you get through this

1121
01:07:24,522 --> 01:07:27,370
is to turn those cameras
back on, now!

1122
01:07:27,402 --> 01:07:28,651
Fuck you!

1123
01:07:28,683 --> 01:07:31,242
Everything out
of your mouth has been a lie,

1124
01:07:31,274 --> 01:07:34,539
and why should
we believe you now?

1125
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:37,930
It's just going to kill us
anyway, idn't that right?

1126
01:07:37,962 --> 01:07:42,059
From fake priest
to false prophet.

1127
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,907
You got it all figured out,
don't you?

1128
01:07:44,939 --> 01:07:47,211
I see the writing
on the wall.

1129
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:49,899
But I see everything!

1130
01:07:52,683 --> 01:07:53,739
Shit.

1131
01:08:02,539 --> 01:08:05,259
We got it!

1132
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:07,179
You ready to save the day,
my friend?

1133
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:16,811
You know what?
Restore the feed.

1134
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:17,931
Yeah?

1135
01:08:17,963 --> 01:08:19,755
I want the world
to see this.

1136
01:08:26,539 --> 01:08:27,818
Oh, God!

1137
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,355
It says here
he's a Marquis of Hell,

1138
01:08:29,387 --> 01:08:31,019
governs 40 infernal legions.

1139
01:08:31,051 --> 01:08:33,163
Oh my God,
no wonder he's so powerful.

1140
01:08:33,195 --> 01:08:36,170
I don't give a shit.
Send me the rites, man.

1141
01:08:36,203 --> 01:08:38,474
Come on.

1142
01:08:38,506 --> 01:08:41,899
Shit! I haven't put them in yet.
Give me a second.

1143
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,659
This one. This one.

1144
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,419
Here we go.
Here we go.

1145
01:08:49,451 --> 01:08:51,881
Come on.
Commander...

1146
01:08:56,875 --> 01:09:00,521
You know, Maxi, now that
we've got our audience back,

1147
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:03,883
I think we can hold our own
these last few minutes.

1148
01:09:03,915 --> 01:09:07,627
Three's a crowd, right?

1149
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:09,098
Drew, watch out!

1150
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:13,323
Ah!

1151
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:31,819
Mmm, mmm, mmm,
that'll just shock yourself.

1152
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,667
Let him go, please!

1153
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,619
Lift the veil!

1154
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:40,395
Or you could just let him die
and you can go free.

1155
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:42,155
I don't what more to say!

1156
01:09:42,187 --> 01:09:44,586
You do!

1157
01:09:44,618 --> 01:09:47,818
And so does the girl.

1158
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:51,819
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

1159
01:09:51,851 --> 01:09:54,315
Drew! Max, help him!

1160
01:09:54,347 --> 01:09:55,755
It wants another confession.

1161
01:09:55,787 --> 01:09:59,435
- What?
- It says we both know.

1162
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:04,842
Oh! Oh!

1163
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:06,698
Mm-hmm.

1164
01:10:08,618 --> 01:10:12,522
Oh, I, um...

1165
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:13,611
What?

1166
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:15,435
Oh.
Oh, my God.

1167
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:20,395
A long time ago,
before you and I met,

1168
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:21,418
Max and I...

1169
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:23,659
- Ah!
- It was short-lived.

1170
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:24,905
He...

1171
01:10:24,938 --> 01:10:25,995
You motherfucker!

1172
01:10:26,027 --> 01:10:28,523
You motherfucker!

1173
01:10:28,555 --> 01:10:31,179
Ah!
How could you keep that from me?

1174
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:34,187
Drew, I ghosted her, man.
I was a total fucking dick.

1175
01:10:34,219 --> 01:10:35,691
You know me, alright?

1176
01:10:35,722 --> 01:10:37,067
She already hated me
by the time you hired her,

1177
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:38,698
and I didn't want
to put us at odds, alright?

1178
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:40,395
I'd never seen you
so fucking happy.

1179
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:41,675
I had a right to know!

1180
01:10:41,707 --> 01:10:43,402
I was going to tell you,
I swear,

1181
01:10:43,435 --> 01:10:47,179
but I had just met and I put
it off until it was just...

1182
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:50,283
Ancient history, man.

1183
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:52,939
Meant to be forgotten.

1184
01:10:52,971 --> 01:10:56,267
Ah!
Mmm!

1185
01:10:56,299 --> 01:10:59,562
Baby, hey, look at me.

1186
01:10:59,595 --> 01:11:01,867
Don't let this
come between us.

1187
01:11:03,019 --> 01:11:05,515
I love you.

1188
01:11:06,955 --> 01:11:10,122
I love you, too.

1189
01:11:10,155 --> 01:11:13,387
Oh, no.

1190
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:15,211
Right, now let him go!

1191
01:11:15,243 --> 01:11:18,219
Ah.

1192
01:11:18,251 --> 01:11:20,619
What?

1193
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,019
What...
what's that?

1194
01:11:23,051 --> 01:11:26,027
Oh, shit!

1195
01:11:26,059 --> 01:11:29,451
What?

1196
01:11:29,482 --> 01:11:30,827
It's a wrong number.

1197
01:11:32,779 --> 01:11:33,739
What is that?

1198
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:34,985
Shut up!

1199
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:46,667
<i>Hey!</i>

1200
01:11:48,747 --> 01:11:50,795
<i>I hate being on camera.
Stop!</i>

1201
01:11:50,827 --> 01:11:52,715
<i>The camera
loves you though.</i>

1202
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:53,771
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1203
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,347
<i>Oh! Very nice!</i>

1204
01:11:58,378 --> 01:12:01,610
<i>Pose for me.</i>

1205
01:12:01,643 --> 01:12:03,467
<i>Oh!</i>

1206
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:06,666
<i>That's perty, isn't it?</i>

1207
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:10,027
<i>I'll show you...</i>

1208
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:15,339
You told me you deleted that,
you piece of shit!

1209
01:12:15,371 --> 01:12:16,683
I thought I did.

1210
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,619
Drew.

1211
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,946
Let me explain, man.

1212
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:29,291
What's up? You saving that
for a lonely night?

1213
01:12:29,323 --> 01:12:31,786
I swear to God I never
watch it, dude. I swear!

1214
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:34,027
Just like
the karaoke chick, yeah?

1215
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:37,642
How many pictures and videos
of my soon-to-be wife

1216
01:12:37,675 --> 01:12:39,818
do you have
on your phone?

1217
01:12:39,851 --> 01:12:41,643
Cocksucker.

1218
01:12:42,698 --> 01:12:44,395
You know, I don't know
what's worse,

1219
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:47,371
the thought of you rubbing
one out to my wife

1220
01:12:47,403 --> 01:12:50,122
or the fact that
you fucking use everybody.

1221
01:12:50,155 --> 01:12:51,786
You're a fucking leech!

1222
01:12:51,819 --> 01:12:53,706
This is what it wants.

1223
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:55,274
To drive us apart.

1224
01:12:55,307 --> 01:12:57,163
I like the way it thinks.

1225
01:12:58,219 --> 01:12:59,755
You know all of my life,

1226
01:12:59,787 --> 01:13:02,763
all my life I treated you
like a brother!

1227
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,299
And for what?

1228
01:13:04,331 --> 01:13:06,507
Drew.

1229
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:11,242
Bullshit! You never cared
about anybody but yourself,

1230
01:13:11,275 --> 01:13:12,971
you conceited fuck!

1231
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:20,299
Drew,
you're going to kill him.

1232
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,931
Yeah, go on, kill him.

1233
01:13:21,962 --> 01:13:24,747
I'll release you
and the girl.

1234
01:13:24,778 --> 01:13:27,979
- It's okay.
- Man, don't do it.

1235
01:13:44,651 --> 01:13:46,827
Push the button.

1236
01:13:46,858 --> 01:13:49,994
- What?
- Push the god damn button!

1237
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:05,002
Come on!
Commander of legions

1238
01:14:05,035 --> 01:14:06,795
and all the servants
that you control that you.

1239
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:13,994
You can't defeat me!

1240
01:14:14,027 --> 01:14:15,691
Fuck you!

1241
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:22,698
And by the power
of the Almighty...

1242
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,139
Shit!

1243
01:14:41,003 --> 01:14:42,827
Max,
You got to take over!

1244
01:14:52,235 --> 01:14:54,922
And the power of the Almighty
and the hand of his son,

1245
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:56,363
Lord, Jesus Christ.

1246
01:14:56,395 --> 01:14:58,826
You and your army shall be
swept away to the pit of glory

1247
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:01,771
where you will forever
lay your heads.

1248
01:15:01,802 --> 01:15:05,611
Depart, Aamon, and depart
servile demons from this vessel,

1249
01:15:05,642 --> 01:15:07,883
for her future and past
are not in your hands,

1250
01:15:07,915 --> 01:15:11,275
but in the arms of the
Sovereign Lord God Almighty.

1251
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,970
It is he and he alone

1252
01:15:13,002 --> 01:15:14,890
who brought the world
into being.

1253
01:15:14,922 --> 01:15:16,427
Numbers of

1254
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:19,851
and know the day
that our soul takes flight.

1255
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,739
Thus humble yourself demon.

1256
01:15:21,771 --> 01:15:23,978
You are helpless
before your creator.

1257
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:51,851
Get this thing off me!

1258
01:15:57,515 --> 01:15:58,986
Drew, wait!

1259
01:15:59,019 --> 01:16:00,331
Lane?
Lane, Lane.

1260
01:16:00,362 --> 01:16:01,995
I'm here, baby.

1261
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,650
Oh, shit!

1262
01:16:08,682 --> 01:16:10,570
Drew! Drew, what do I do?

1263
01:16:10,602 --> 01:16:12,171
Keep reading!

1264
01:16:19,306 --> 01:16:21,322
For under his command
and his command alone.

1265
01:16:21,355 --> 01:16:24,587
In the name of Jesus Christ,
make haste and

1266
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:29,706
Drew, what are you doing?
You're hurting me!

1267
01:16:29,739 --> 01:16:31,178
Oh, fuck you, bitch!

1268
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:36,074
The monster of the wretched
hell, tarry not

1269
01:16:36,107 --> 01:16:38,570
and return to your master,
the Prince of Darkness.

1270
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:41,322
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I bind you and your army,

1271
01:16:41,355 --> 01:16:42,667
to cast you out
from this place.

1272
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:43,722
Ah!

1273
01:16:45,259 --> 01:16:46,602
Drew, I didn't finish!

1274
01:16:49,899 --> 01:16:52,779
Go ahead.
Finish me.

1275
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,379
What are you waiting for?

1276
01:16:54,411 --> 01:16:56,202
Five minutes to kill.

1277
01:16:56,234 --> 01:16:57,675
Any ideas?

1278
01:16:57,706 --> 01:16:59,051
Go fuck yourself.

1279
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:10,378
The power of the holy spirit

1280
01:17:10,411 --> 01:17:13,195
compress this vessel and
creation of the Almighty God,

1281
01:17:13,226 --> 01:17:15,307
who casts a white light of
purity at which you cower.

1282
01:17:15,338 --> 01:17:17,354
Retreat now, Aamon, into desolation.

1283
01:17:17,388 --> 01:17:19,178
Gravel at the feet
of your lord savior

1284
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:22,058
in the void of the pain

1285
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:40,138
Amen.

1286
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:42,859
Lane? Lane?

1287
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:44,106
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no!

1288
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:44,938
- Hey!
- No!

1289
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:47,466
Hey! Hey! It's me.
It's me. It's me.

1290
01:17:58,059 --> 01:18:01,002
It's okay.

1291
01:18:01,035 --> 01:18:02,378
Hey, listen.
I just want to say...

1292
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,138
No.

1293
01:18:04,171 --> 01:18:06,186
No, like, please, okay?
I know I don't deserve it.

1294
01:18:06,218 --> 01:18:07,308
No!

1295
01:18:09,674 --> 01:18:11,051
Not another word.

1296
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:16,682
What am I supposed
to do now, huh?

1297
01:18:20,139 --> 01:18:23,114
Well, we're still live.

1298
01:18:23,146 --> 01:18:24,523
Ask your groupies.

1299
01:18:30,026 --> 01:18:33,131
Okay.

1300
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,738
- Ah!
- Holy shit!

1301
01:18:48,426 --> 01:18:50,251
That can't be.

1302
01:18:53,035 --> 01:18:55,018
It was supposed to work.

1303
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:57,228
- We said all of Aamon's rites.
- No.

1304
01:18:57,259 --> 01:19:00,426
You are no man of God,

1305
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:05,772
and I am not Aamon.

1306
01:19:05,803 --> 01:19:07,723
We... we narrowed down
all the names.

1307
01:19:07,755 --> 01:19:12,651
We wrote the names...
all the names on the list.

1308
01:19:12,683 --> 01:19:17,483
It was my list.

1309
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:19,146
What's The Devil's Database?

1310
01:19:19,179 --> 01:19:20,970
This baby right here
is a digital encyclopedia

1311
01:19:21,002 --> 01:19:25,068
of every demon
known to man.

1312
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:27,339
Oh, God!

1313
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:29,772
He's not here right now.

1314
01:20:29,196 --> 01:20:32,139
Oh, Maxi.

1315
01:20:34,187 --> 01:20:37,450
It's much too late for that.

1316
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:49,898
Drew, cut the feed!
Cut the feed! Cut the feed!

1317
01:20:51,818 --> 01:20:53,196
Lane!

1318
01:20:53,227 --> 01:20:55,212
Oh, why me?

1319
01:20:55,243 --> 01:20:56,650
Why us?

1320
01:21:09,483 --> 01:21:11,627
<i>We have started
our descent into Mumbai.</i>

1321
01:21:37,194 --> 01:21:39,211
Come on! Come on!

1322
01:21:39,243 --> 01:21:41,387
Come on, Lane!
Lane, no! Come on!

1323
01:21:41,419 --> 01:21:42,379
Call an ambulance!

1324
01:21:42,411 --> 01:21:44,076
Come on, Lane! Come on, baby!
Come on, come on.

1325
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,027
Come on, come on!
Come back. Come back.

1326
01:21:46,059 --> 01:21:48,650
There you go. There you go.
Shh, shh.

1327
01:21:48,682 --> 01:21:50,634
No, no, no, don't get up. Don't get up.

1328
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:53,611
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

1329
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:55,563
What happened?

1330
01:21:55,596 --> 01:21:58,122
I don't.

1331
01:21:58,154 --> 01:22:01,002
I was hoping
you could tell us.

1332
01:22:01,034 --> 01:22:03,467
The whole time you were...

1333
01:22:03,499 --> 01:22:07,083
you were telling us
to... to cut the feed.

1334
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:14,634
There's more to it
than that, isn't there?

1335
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,787
Mm?

1336
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:20,811
I can't remember.

1337
01:23:40,171 --> 01:23:42,379
Please tell me
he's in there holding the pen.

1338
01:23:42,411 --> 01:23:45,067
Yes, but he's cranky.
He missed dinner again.

1339
01:23:45,099 --> 01:23:46,283
Shit.

1340
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:47,819
Hey, little guy!

1341
01:23:47,851 --> 01:23:49,643
You here to see your Daddy?

1342
01:23:49,675 --> 01:23:51,051
I think it's better
to let him in.

1343
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:54,827
Somebody wanted to say
goodnight, Mr. President.

1344
01:23:54,859 --> 01:23:56,427
Hey, bud.

1345
01:23:56,459 --> 01:23:58,283
What are you still doing up?

1346
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:04,171
- Look out!
- Bryce!

1347
01:24:04,203 --> 01:24:05,451
- Get off me!
- What are you...

1348
01:24:05,483 --> 01:24:06,762
- Get off me!
- Aah!

1349
01:24:34,123 --> 01:24:36,939
Show's canceled.

1350
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:39,306
Now what?

1351
01:25:11,081 --> 01:25:13,898
<i>We need units here now!</i>

1352
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:15,403
<i>Shots fired! Shots fired!</i>

1353
01:25:15,435 --> 01:25:17,419
<i>Send backup now
to 1200 Washington!</i>

1354
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:41,867
<i>And 12 passengers
broke into the cockpit,</i>

1355
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:43,211
<i>attacked the pilot.</i>

1356
01:25:43,243 --> 01:25:45,835
<i>Nosedived into a field
just outside Mumbai.</i>

1357
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:49,067
<i>Authorities
have not ruled out terrorism.</i>
