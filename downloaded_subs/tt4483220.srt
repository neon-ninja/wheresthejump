00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:53,569
She falls on the ground dazed.

182
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,546
She's climbing and clawing
her way to the bed.

183
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,131
They're walking over her, laughing.

184
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:58,532
They pin her down.

185
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:03,095
The one takes the wine bottle,
one, two, crack, glass everywhere.

186
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,289
She's screaming, "Oh! My head is bleeding!

187
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,540
You're killing me!"

188
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:07,933
She falls on one of the shards of glass.

189
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,313
It lodges in her neck, and when she rolls,
it slits her throat, and she bleeds out.

190
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,381
That's how she died.

191
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:20,054
Please dismount the dead body, deputy.

192
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:24,058
Oh, yeah, um... Just...

193
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,061
You just contaminated the entire crime scene.

194
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:31,749
Also, are you actually holding
the potential murder weapon

195
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,525
without gloves?

196
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,238
Guess who's our prime suspect
when we run that for prints, now.

197
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:45,079
- May I?
- Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,956
There was only one attacker.

199
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:48,791
He or she was already in the room.

200
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,477
There's no sign of struggle or
forced entry at the door.

201
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:56,106
Also, there's no sign of anything
missing, so it's clearly not a robbery.

202
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,900
Our victim comes in to enjoy a glass of wine

203
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,902
when the attacker jumps out of the bathroom,

204
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:02,780
where he or she has been hiding,
hence why the door is ajar.

205
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,368
The attacker grabs the bottle of wine,
hits our girl over the head.

206
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:08,852
You were right there.

207
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,772
Our victim is dazed, she puts up a fight,

208
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,274
and the attacker slits her throat.

209
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,443
Right in the aorta.

210
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,947
- Or jugular.
- Yeah. Yeah, jugular.

211
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,502
Uh...

212
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,088
Maybe it's a Halloween thing?

213
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:41,760
Maybe. Do you have a name?

214
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,721
Uh, no. Her ID was missing.

215
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:46,949
Did you check with the manager?

216
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:50,769
Yeah, yeah. He speaks a different
dialect than I'm used to,

217
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,522
but I'll give it another whirl.

218
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:01,697
I hate Halloween.

219
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,930
All right. Come on.

220
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,348
You're a grown up.

221
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,160
You've got this, Morgan. You're the man.

222
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,287
Start acting like one. Just ask her out.

223
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,523
Just ask her out.
It's no big deal. Huh? Right?

224
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,958
I mean if she says no...

225
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,611
- (WOMAN MOANING)
- You do work together.

226
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:44,131
So it'll be awkward every time
you see her, but if she says yes...

227
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:45,991
WOMAN: Yes! Yes!

228
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,369
If she says yes, then you date
for a while, and then she dumps you.

229
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:52,389
Stop, no. No, you're doing it again.

230
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,166
Don't stop! Don't stop!

231
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:58,170
Just, okay, look, you're a gentleman.

232
00:17:58,337 --> 00:17:59,588
You're a gentleman. Go up to her.

233
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:02,299
- Just walk up and say...
- MAN: God, I love your tits!

234
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,343
Jesus, just walk up and say...

235
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,595
WOMAN: Lick them! Lick my tits! Lick my tits!

236
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:07,721
Really?

237
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,782
My God, okay.

238
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:13,811
Just walk up and say,
Laurie, I like you, and...

239
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,270
MAN: You make my dick so hard.

240
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,648
Okay. I can't do this.

241
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:24,696
Don't be jealous.

242
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,991
Storage closet? Really?

243
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:29,952
Yeah. Employees only, baby.

244
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,246
(CHUCKLES)

245
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,878
Your favorite customer awaits.

246
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:41,463
Yay.

247
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:52,015
You know, you're going to
have to give it up sometime.

248
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:53,809
Why not him?

249
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,661
I bet he'd be gentle.

250
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,855
Maybe even cuddle after.

251
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,791
I am not a virgin.

252
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,442
I don't know why you would think that.

253
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,672
Laurie, my 13-year-old
cousin has the same costume.

254
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,908
And even she is more
sexually active than you are.

255
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,511
Well, I blame Tinder for that.

256
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,746
And who are you supposed to be?

257
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:17,558
I'm Sexy Hillary Clinton.

258
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,760
- (CHUCKLES)
- What?

259
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,547
You're saying you wouldn't
vote for these in 2016?

260
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:28,010
Wow. Christina, I had no idea
you were so into politics.

261
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,013
The mashed potatoes are lukewarm.

262
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,765
The steak tastes like a charred, dirty boot.

263
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,602
And what the hell is it you're wearing?

264
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,520
I'm the Seventh Dr. Who.

265
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:40,272
- Dr. What?
- Dr. Who.

266
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,774
I'm asking you what is the doctor's name.

267
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,693
No, I know what you're
asking me, I'm trying to tell you.

268
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,737
Dr. Who.

269
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:50,824
Now you're just being a smart ass.

270
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,451
Oh, you know, I'll tell you what, Charlie,

271
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,303
I'm gonna take this back
to the kitchen, all right,

272
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:56,997
and we're going to make you, like,
a brand-spanking new one.

273
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:59,082
Okay? No more dirty boot.

274
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,878
Jackass.

275
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:05,339
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

276
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,341
I'm Machete, motherfucker.

277
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:11,094
Well, you look like Pedro from Napoleon
Dynamite, if he was into bondage.

278
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:13,430
And you, what are you?
Saturday Night Live's fever?

279
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,641
Wow, you intentionally
mess up that reference?

280
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:18,936
No, I'm dressed up as a real life superhero.

281
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:21,313
Me. Did you see that game last week?

282
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,398
Yeah, no, you're an
intramural football legend.

283
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:26,485
And what are you, gay Sherlock Holmes?

284
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,320
Peace offering.

285
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,574
I need a Charlie special.

286
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,255
There you go.

287
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:50,901
Jesus came back from the dead
quicker than this plate.

288
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,594
Sorry.

289
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,526
Enjoy.

290
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,947
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

291
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,204
Do we really need five people
waiting on Charlie?

292
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:22,124
- No, we can let Jason do it.
- Shh.

293
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,918
Tonight is opening night
at the Macon County Funhouse,

294
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,045
a haunted attraction that
has caused some controversy

295
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:29,548
in recent weeks drawing
from local urban legends.

296
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:33,844
One maze is actually based on Manuel
Dyer’s mass suicide 10 years ago.

297
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:37,514
Is this in poor taste, or just
good old-fashioned spooky fun?

298
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:40,309
Either way, fun starts tonight at 9:00 P.M.

299
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:41,810
Back to you, Jack.

300
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:46,440
It's just a bunch of right-wing a-holes
trying to shut down our Halloween fun.

301
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,626
But if these are based on real crimes, those
people could have families around here.

302
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,504
What if the ghosts of the cult
are lurking in the halls?

303
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,406
- Oh, my God, we have to go.
- I'm in.

304
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:56,283
I'm taking the trash out.

305
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,994
Fine, we won't go.

306
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:03,332
Then you two can just
hang out together. Alone.

307
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,377
I'm down to hang out if you want to.

308
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:09,212
We can do that, we can hang out.

309
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,465
Just the... no, we don't have to.

310
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,133
It's not...

311
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,968
I didn't say no.

312
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:16,737
No, I know. I was just saying.

313
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:19,056
Like, in case you didn't want to.

314
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:20,724
I didn't want to assume or any...

315
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,284
Just... what? Forget it.

316
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:24,686
(CHUCKLES)

317
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,980
What?

318
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,608
- I lost my boner.
- I'm gonna kill you.

319
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:31,835
At this rate, you won't
get a handsy until you're 87.

320
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,213
Yeah, and you're going to
have herpes for the 87th time.

321
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,323
Yeah, he has herpes.

322
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,785
You can only get it once.

323
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,246
I don't have herpes.

324
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:53,673
Come on, guys.

325
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:09,439
(GASPS)

326
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,860
(CAT SHRIEKS)

327
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,835
- Boo!
- (SCREAMS)

328
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,795
Ah!

329
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:36,775
(LAUGHING)

330
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:39,177
You hit me in the head
with a can of creamed corn.

331
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:40,762
Well, you snuck up behind me in the dark.

332
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:42,472
- What do you expect?
- Oh, come on.

333
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,850
It's all in the spirit of Hallow's Eve cheer.

334
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,744
Speaking of which, Gerardo's going
to take us to the fun house.

335
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,204
You guys should come with.

336
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,273
What? I can't fit everybody.

337
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,984
Uh, you drive a Ford Ranger, Gerardo.

338
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:55,961
Okay, it's the largest of the compact trucks.

339
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:58,547
Fine, if you can fit in the back.

340
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,991
I have to keep the inside clean for Rosalina.

341
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:03,952
Listen, we're in. We've just got
to get these two pussies to go.

342
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,620
I didn't say that I wouldn't.

343
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:07,330
- Oh, come on, guys.
- If you didn't want to go...

344
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:10,600
Guy, come on, it's not
like the funhouse is positioned

345
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,796
creepily in the middle of nowhere with
only a broken down asylum nearby.

346
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:19,009
Haunted by the ghosts of its
dead, deranged inmates.

347
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:20,552
What's there to be afraid of? Come on.

348
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,805
- Everything that you just said.
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:27,476
Woo!

350
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,269
Let's go, come on!

351
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,105
Let's do it!

352
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:36,151
Will somebody bring me my check?

353
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:43,550
Everything set up like we planned?

354
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,077
Yes, Daddy.

355
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:49,498
Then let's give the boys a
tour of their new playground.

356
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,559
Maybe the news is right.

357
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:13,188
I mean, this whole thing
feels a little exploitative.

358
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,983
You think our customers are
gonna care that our theme

359
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,110
is too realistically violent?

360
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,922
That's like getting mad that porn
has too much real sex in it.

361
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,282
And that "bad press" is only helping us.

362
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:27,244
#getkilledinmacontonight
is twittering on the Tweezer.

363
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,246
Who cares if someone's feelings get hurt?

364
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:31,014
Tweezer is not a thing.

365
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:32,958
What about your electric fence?

366
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,545
I don't want any punk kids
trying to sneak in for free.

367
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:39,339
Pay, or don't play.

368
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:46,304
(SCREAMING)

369
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:48,615
Oh, my God!

370
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:50,283
I see the animatronics work.

371
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:51,993
Hope you didn't shit your pants there, Walt.

372
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,354
You still got seven hours
on my clock, let's go.

373
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:04,823
(SNIFFING)

374
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,075
Weed!

375
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:26,428
Hey, that's some expensive shit.

376
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,099
I was done with it.

377
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:48,074
Fucking Dennis double booked us.

378
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,859
(WHISTLING)

379
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,537
Wait...

380
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:36,831
No.

381
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:40,168
No! This is wrong!

382
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:42,587
Look at these portions!

383
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,632
I didn't run a goddamn Cheesecake Factory!

384
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:53,390
These aren't even taxidermist tools.

385
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,817
Sorry, friends.

386
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,194
I got a new flock now.

387
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:09,406
(CHUCKLES)

388
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,827
(COUGHING, LAUGHING)

389
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:19,082
Un-freaking-believable.

390
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:20,875
On the biggest night of my life,

391
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:23,461
and you guys are getting wacky
with the illegal paraphernalia.

392
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:25,672
Does this look like Colorado to you?

393
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,816
Do I look like John Freaking Denver?

394
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:29,217
(LAUGHING)

395
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:31,469
You trying to get me arrested, guys?

396
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,448
Nobody's gonna get arrested.
It's basically legal everywhere.

397
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:37,350
Not in my workplace.

398
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:40,161
Not now, not ever.

399
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:41,312
Now listen, you guys better pull your shit...

400
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,939
(FEEDBACK)

401
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,816
MANNY: Whoa! That's a hot mic. My apologies.

402
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:47,026
Listen! Handle this!

403
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:51,339
Uh... guys...

404
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:53,116
You should all get back to...

405
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:56,995
Aw, fuck it. Let me hit that thing.

406
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:01,416
My fellow maniacs, all we wanted was

407
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:04,335
for our grim art to be seen by the world.

408
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:07,147
But they shunned us, locked us away,

409
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:11,301
and now they have the gall
to profit off what they fear.

410
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:16,639
I don't know what Dennis told you,
but I'm the Stitchface Killer tonight.

411
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:20,643
And your make-up looks terrible.

412
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,982
I'm giving you a second
chance to go down in history

413
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:29,527
as the most deranged sons
and daughters of bitches

414
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:31,738
this world has ever seen.

415
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,217
No-one will ever forget our names.

416
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:40,221
We will be the fuel to
their nightmares forever.

417
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:44,751
I think I'm gonna put
you in the Heisman pose.

418
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,131
I wonder where that other ass clown went.

419
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:55,570
Oh, what the fuck!

420
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,472
(SCREAMING)

421
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:11,402
So tonight we're going to play a little game.

422
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:13,530
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Daniel Day Lewis?

423
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:17,075
This P.A. system is for announcements
and emergencies only, not...

424
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,453
Hey, I didn't hire you.

425
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,580
Who the hell are you?

426
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:24,582
Well, you don't know me.

427
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:27,210
But I'm pretty sure you know her.

428
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:31,589
Eileen?

429
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,425
Hey, listen, man,
if you're her ex or something,

430
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:36,594
it didn't mean anything.
We were just fuckbuddies, okay?

431
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:39,656
That's not a very nice way
to talk about my daughter.

432
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:41,891
Your daugh...

433
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:44,519
Hey, uh... listen, pal,

434
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:47,146
I'm sure you're probably not
feeling good about the fact

435
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,731
that you couldn't keep her off the pole.

436
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,834
That girl's got issues, okay?

437
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:53,753
But this is a big night for me,
I built this place from the ground up.

438
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:56,739
- And I'll be goddamned...
- Your ego is astounding.

439
00:30:58,032 --> 00:30:59,718
You think all this was your idea?

440
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:01,494
Damn straight.

441
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,639
My little Eileen and I have been
planning this for quite some time.

442
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,585
You were just a puppet, and she pulled
just the right strings to ensure

443
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:11,588
that you created the perfect
forum for our return.

444
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:21,014
Sadly, Pinocchio,

445
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,641
we no longer have any use for you.

446
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,415
I hope you like lawsuits.

447
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:33,234
'Cause I'm gonna sue the shit out of you.

448
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,786
Where was I?

449
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:51,644
Aw, yes. Daddy has lots of
presents for you tonight,

450
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:55,798
so, just like Christmas,
feel free to rip them open.

451
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:42,553
This girl used to kill
popular kids at school.

452
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,180
She used to stitch their eyeballs!

453
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:45,974
(SHOUTING)

454
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,892
- She did!
- No, she didn't.

455
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,352
What was her name?
What was her name? You remember.

456
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,770
- Her name is Stitchface.
- There it is.

457
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:52,480
- My God!
- That's right.

458
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:56,584
My brother's best friend's sister's cousin
knew one of the kids that went missing.

459
00:32:56,734 --> 00:33:00,154
There are so many degrees
of separation in that.

460
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:02,423
So Stitchface, she's up
in Statesville too, huh?

461
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:05,493
Some say there are
dozens of criminally insane

462
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,745
patients still up at Statesville.

463
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:10,373
- Randall and I have been there 100 times.
- It was like, two times.

464
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,918
And I'll tell you, it's more surveiled
than Morgan's internet history.

465
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:16,671
Okay, my cousin's Larry's
uncle's best friend...

466
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,214
You're such... shut up!

467
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:21,526
Okay, knew a guy who disappeared.

468
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:23,011
Oh, my God.

469
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:26,681
Well, I don't know about you guys, but so
far this traffic jam ride's pretty sweet.

470
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,891
- Yeah.
- Gerardo!

471
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:30,743
(HONKING)

472
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,745
- Why are we not moving?
- Shut up!

473
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,731
Woo!

474
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,699
I hate Halloween.

475
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,451
Why?

476
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:48,619
Because you always send us to
the same cheesy haunted houses.

477
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:52,390
Play the same 12 pop songs to the
same annoying pre-pubescents.

478
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,142
That's why we should get into podcasts.

479
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,835
Nobody listens to the radio anymore.

480
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:57,395
Why don't you partner
with my nephew, who's 10?

481
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,714
Come on, we're partners.
We're Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

482
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,382
We're as dead as they are on radio.

483
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:02,925
- Can I...
- Hi.

484
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:04,761
Help you two gents?

485
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:07,488
- Uh, I'm Bob.
- And I'm Dave.

486
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:10,224
We're Dr. Dave and Mr. Bob.

487
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:12,410
- Senor Bob.
- Whatever.

488
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,272
We're the DJs from WKDE, and we're
here to cover the opening.

489
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:19,025
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

490
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,903
You're the two guys from
that morning radio show.

491
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,988
Well, yeah. We used to be.

492
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:27,241
- About 15 years ago.
- 17.

493
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:29,093
Oh, yeah.

494
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:32,288
It's been a while since
I could listen to the radio.

495
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:34,123
Is that, uh...

496
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,793
Yeah, well, can't say I blame you.

497
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,770
I wouldn't listen to us
either if I didn't have to.

498
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,340
Yeah. Uh, amigo, you got a little, um...

499
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:44,943
flavor saver right...

500
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:46,177
Right there, yeah. Huh?

501
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:49,347
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

502
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:50,723
Oh, yeah.

503
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,768
Oh, no, don't...

504
00:34:53,935 --> 00:34:56,996
No, don't do that.

505
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:59,023
- Okay! Okay.
- (GAGGING)

506
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,359
- Okay, you got it.
- Got it. You did it.

507
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,861
Uh, listen, uh...

508
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:06,823
I'll just tell my guys
to bring the trucks back to...

509
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:08,825
Back of the beard... back of the building.

510
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:12,778
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
The stage is right in the center.

511
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,247
That's great.

512
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,307
- Super, thank you.
- All right.

513
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:18,960
- Bon appetit.
- All right. Nice guy.

514
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,628
Dr. Dave.

515
00:35:39,188 --> 00:35:41,624
# Cabinet falls as spider flutters

516
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:43,876
# Doesn't it make you wonder?

517
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:46,696
# It could be who escaped from under

518
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:50,533
Welcome.

519
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,161
Oh. Free to the clergy.

520
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:59,667
Well, I don't know about
you, Bob, but it looks like

521
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,628
a killer scene tonight here
at the Macon County Funhouse

522
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:04,547
on the Land of Illusion stage.

523
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:05,982
That is right, Dr. Dave.

524
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:09,193
People are literally losing their
heads to get in here tonight.

525
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,278
It's crazy.

526
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:12,930
I hope you mean that figuratively, Bob.
Otherwise, I'm making a run for it.

527
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,515
I'll be right behind you.

528
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:17,727
Stand here, please. Thank you.

529
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,940
As I've always said, folks,
quit while you're ahead.

530
00:36:23,107 --> 00:36:24,609
- Absolutely.
- While you have a head.

531
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:27,028
Perfectly said. Quit while you're giving...

532
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:28,487
No, we can't go there.

533
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:35,745
I've never been here but I don't like...

Welcome!

00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:46,005
You'll not escape this park!

538
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:51,469
I'm totally Instagramming this.

539
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:56,933
We may need crowd control.

540
00:36:57,183 --> 00:37:00,102
I haven't seen a line like this
since that Justin Bieber concert.

541
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,271
- Are you a Bieber fan?
- I'm not a Belieber, Bob.

542
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:03,439
- Okay.
- Not a Belieber.

543
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,691
You go first, Robbie.

544
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,152

Where's Robbie?

00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,598
He's probably outside waiting for us.

Uh, don't forget, folks, you bring
six two liter bottles of Shasta,

553
00:37:32,677 --> 00:37:35,263
- what do they get, Bob?
- You get $5 off the entry fee.

554
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:37,115
That's right, folks. Cashta for your Shasta.

555
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:39,158
You'll be saving an arm and a leg.

556
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:40,518
Okay.

557
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:42,203
I tell you what, we're going
to take a little break here,

558
00:37:42,353 --> 00:37:44,080
and we'll be back in a few minutes.

559
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,707
Keep on having a good time
there, Macon county.

560
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:48,776
That is not a good deal, Bob.

561

Besides, only white people like this shit.

Hey, how are we gonna get home?

566
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:14,093
There are a lot of white people.

567
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:17,513

568
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:31,085

his lips at all of you, not just me?

We work together.

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,683
Okay. Did you get a good look at the killer?

594
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,620
She looked like your mom last night!

595
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,065
What? That doesn't even make any sense.

596
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:53,234
That's what she said.

That makes even less sense
than what you just said.

This line is for emergencies only, okay?

your butt will be arrested.

Does it look like I drink beer?

they have skinny margaritas?

Do you think they've ever
had sex in a non-public place?

Nope. They're shameless.

the danger element can be fun.

the sex talk for the third date.

Not a good thing, if she said that.

to me, because I was still inside.

know why she was in town?

really don't know anything

until the story's on my desk.

796
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:17,472
But before she left she mentioned something
about an old asylum near your town.
