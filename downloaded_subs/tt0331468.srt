The family of a woman who died

00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,586
after a botched police raid

00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,680
intend to sue the city
for $500 million,

4
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:25,919
naming the city,
the police department,

5
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,927
and the officers involved
in the raid.

6
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:32,022
You're listening to WNYC
and wnyc. Org.

7
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,600
It's 50 degrees right now.

8
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,159
We have cloudy skies
over the city at 4:29.

9
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,604
Good morning.
I'm Soterios Johnson.

[Moans, coughs]

13
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,569
Remember to reset the clock.

14
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,163
Yeah.

15
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,255
- Thank you.
- Look at this.

16
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,189
Almost 8<i>% %</i>% up from last year.

17
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,250
Yeah, but that's
a nationwide trend now.

18
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,927
What are you thinking?
More cutbacks?

19
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,363
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,959
We'll know more
after this afternoon.

21
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,239
I caught the last 10 minutes

22
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,741
of your husband's
documentary the other night.

23
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,777
Really interesting stuff.

24
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,245
I'll let him know.
He'll be pleased.

25
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,282
It's a real labor of love
for him.

26
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,341
He was, what, the director?

27
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,512
Yeah, director.

28
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,987
Producer.

29
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,388
Writer. Voice-over.

30
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,119
It's real low-budget stuff.

31
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,753
It's tough to make a living
in that business.

32
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,662
Oh, shit.

33
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,829
Kids!

34
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,873
Up! Up! Up! Up!

35
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:21,703
We're late.

36
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,643
Your mom forgot to reset
the alarm again!

37
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,579
Dad, these shoes hurt.

38
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,179
Well, then change them.

39
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,088
Kristen!

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,854
Pour your juice, Jesse.
Just pour your juice.

41
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,191
Oh, shit.

42
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,164
Dad, where's Mom?

43
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:49,600
She's in Cincinnati or Chicago.
Someplace like that.

44
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,001
Oh, my God.
It's late.

45
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,563
I have to be at school
early today.

46
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,006
That's not gonna happen.

47
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,943
Hey, Dad, do they have
a Niketown in Milwaukee?

48
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,176
Actually,
I'm just gonna call Mom.

49
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,843
Hey, Jesse.
She is on an airplane, okay?

50
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,251
I know that.
I'm leaving her a message.

51
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,819
Leah, I have to make a very
big decision by this evening.

52
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,952
So let me ask you something.

53
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:20,122
What would you say if...

54
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,829
I offered you the VP slot?

55
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,674
Wow.

56
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,303
Do I have to say yes right now?

57
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,509
When do we have to be back?

58
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,987
We're booked on the 6:00 flight.

59
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,660
Let's stay over.

60
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,997
We'll discuss this over dinner.

61
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,036
COOPER: Tell them
I'm five minutes away.

62
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,005
I've got the presentation.
I'm ready to roll.

63

- [Horn honking]

64
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,637
- I really need some lunch money.
- All right. I've got it.

- Hey, mom.
- Morning, honey.

68
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,310
- These new shoes are hurting.
- [Horn honking]

69
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,879
Okay, honey, we'll go this
weekend and get you some Vans.

70
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,652
That's what you said last week.

71
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,717
- Jesse, we gotta go.
- [Horn honking]

72
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,557
- See you later. Bye.
- Good.

73
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,688
All right.
Hang on.

74
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,288
Bye, kids.
Love you.

75
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,026
Give me a hug.
Let's go. All right.

76
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,864

going out.

77
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,302
- Have fun.
- [Horn honking]

00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,468
Kristen,
hold your brother's hand!

79
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,511
Cooper, what are you doing?
It's almost 8:30.

80
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,513
Well, we ran
a little bit behind today.

81
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,106
Someone forgot to reset
the alarm.

82
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,514
Jesse.

83
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,177
- No, don't go over that way.
- Why not?

84
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,619
- Hey, asshole!
- [Horn blares]

85
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,853
- Jesse, stop! Jesse!
- [Tires screech]

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,624
Oh, my God!

88
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,456
Cooper?

89
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,223
Oh, my God!

90
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,855
Jesse!

91
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,455
Jesse! Jesse!

92
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,630
We've got to get out
of the city.

93
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,654
How are we gonna do that?

94
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,791
So, what about my job?

95
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,832
Take a year off.

96
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,562
Write a book. You always
wanted to write a book.

97
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,906
JESSE: So, Mom, how can
we afford something so big?

98
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,410
We would get a lot of money
for our house in the city.

99
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,878
Big houses in the country
cost a lot less

100
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,471
than tiny houses
in New York City.

101
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,483
COOPER: There are some houses
that the bank has foreclosed on.

102
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,145
That means someone ran out
of money.

103
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,712
So the bank can sell it
at a really cheap price.

104
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,052
KRISTEN:
That's screwed up.

105
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,491

Sure.

Oh, that's okay.

Yeah. Nice.

We're serving lunch.

119
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,095
Do you want me to tell you
the specials?

120
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,537
Oh, that's all right.
We already ate.

121

- KRISTEN: Hey, Mom?
- LEAH: Huh?

122
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,676
How many more of these stupid
houses do we have to see?

123
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,736
This should be the last one.

124
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,645
I couldn't get it arranged
to get inside.

125
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,378
We'll just take a quick look
and be on the way home, okay?

126
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,750
Promise.

127
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,255
Where you guys headed?

00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,348
Cold Creek Manor.

129
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,156
So if we just go on down
the road here,

130
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,889
are we going
the right direction?

131
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,431
Yeah.
It's about a mile that way.

132
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,999
Thanks.

133
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,730

- Wow.

- Look.

- It's unlocked.

It's unlocked.

What are you doing?

- Dad, we can see it from here.
- Cooper.

140
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,019
- What?
- We can see it right here.

141
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,249
We'll just take a look.
Just take a little peek.

142
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,223
Nobody here.

143
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,201

Thanks, Dad.

What are these?

156
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,343
Those are farming... things.

157
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,183
For what?

158
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,052
For farming.

159
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,888
Yeah.

Can we buy this house, please?

It's so cool.
Can we?

I don't know.
What do you think, angel?

165
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,298
It's pretty cool.

167
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,210
We'll see.

[Gasps, screams]

169

We had no intention
to break the law.

No harm done.

171
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,680
I didn't know the property
was on the market yet.

00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,041
You kids put
your safety belts on, now.

180
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,408
COOPER:
Seat belts. [Clears throat]

181
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,947
Okay, folks.
Take care.

182
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,677
[Indistinct talking
on police radio]

183
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,092
[Indistinct talking,
chain saw buzzing]

184
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,402
Well, rather than cherry-pick
the odd nice piece,

185
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,946
I'm willing to make
a generous offer of $18,500

186
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,242
for the entire contents.

187
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,715
Excuse me.
But I'm from New York, okay?

188
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,686
Go tell your father
I need him down here right now.

189
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,291
COOPER: It's a beautiful house.
It's a beautiful town.

190
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,694
- Dad.
- Yeah?

191
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,788
Mom needs you.

192
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,127
In a minute, Jesse.

193
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,632
She said she needed you now.

194
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,862
I know. I know.
But I'm busy right now, okay?

195
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,337
Stan, Declan, this way.
Come on.

196
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,635
All right.

197
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,699
Stan, put that box
right up there.

198
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,974
Declan, take that box
into the office.

199
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,985
"Grady"?

200
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,260
All this goes, too?

201
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,203
Uh, yeah.

202
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,297
I think so.

203
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,341
What about this room?

204
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,606
Oh, God, there's so many rooms
in this house.

205
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,974
- Oh, boy.
- Maps.

206
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,611
Paper work.

207
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,848
Maps and more maps.

208
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:35,557
"Hammerhand will find the weak.
Hurl them down to rot and reek.

209
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,797
Bash your skull and toss you in.

210
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:43,239
Your pain is short.
Your blood runs thin.

211
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,043
The strong are spared
to breed and spawn.

212
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,606
Graze around the devil's yawn."

213
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,382
What are you doing?

214
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,927
Just going over
all these papers.

215
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,726
The kids are starving.
Do you want to go eat?

216
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:39,992
Yeah.
I'm hungry.

217
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,897
- Yeah, me too.
- Look at this.

218
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,469
- Is that this house?
- Yes.

219
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,060
- Look at that.
- Wow.

220
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,469
That was taken in the '30s.
Look at that car.

221
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,701
[Both laugh]

222
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,937
Isn't it great?
Look at the yard.

223
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,707
Doesn't look like that now.

224
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,213
No.
But it will again.

225
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,511
- Think so?
- After you mow it.

226
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,074
Oh!

227
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,346
Let's go eat.
I'm hungry.

228
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,118
Okay.

229
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,852
[Chuckles]

230
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,728
Kristen, would you mind
hanging up the phone?

231
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,492
Where'd you get that jacket?

232
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,089
It's Grady's.

233
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,360
Hot drinks.
Who had the tea?

234
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,901
- Oh, she had the tea.
- You had the tea?

235
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,493
- Yeah.
- Tea for you.

236
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,765
And coffee for you.
You wanting cream and sugar?

237
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,137
I'll take some cream.

238
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,608
How do they have any right
to be dumping his stuff?

239
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,770
They bought it.
They bought everything in it.

240
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,076
So?
They could rent a locker.

241
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,775
They could put it in storage.

242
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,316
And the cream.

243
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,150
- Oh, thanks.
- Great.

244
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:09,813
Food's okay?

245
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,083
- Yeah. Good.
- Yeah.

246
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,318
I'm Cooper, by the way.

247
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,554
Ray Pinski.
Great to meet you.

248
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,721
- This is Leah. Kristen.
- Hi.

249
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:18,821
Jesse.

250
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,661
- Jesse? [Laughs]
- Yeah.

251
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,927
- Kristen.
- Ray.

252
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,969
- Ray?
- Oh. My wife.

253
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,096
I'm Ellen Pinski.
Hi.

254
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,696
This is our daughter, Stephanie.

255
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,637
Hi.

256
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,199
- Hi. Leah.
- Hi.

257
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,177
Do you kids like horses?

258
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,645
Mom.

259
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,682
- COOPER: Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

260
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,842
Well, Stephanie has a horse.

261
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,250
And I think he needs
feeding right now.

262
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,549
Would that be okay?

263
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,816
Yeah. Sure.
Hey.

264
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,414
Cool.

265
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,289
LEAH:
Kristen, why don't you go, too?

266
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,227
Hmm? Go on.
Go.

267
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,763
I said, "go."

268
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,355
Go. Now.

269
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,593
Why don't you leave
that cellphone here with me?

270
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,535
If someone calls,
I can tell 'em where you are.

271
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,474
- They're at that age.
- [Sighs] She's tough.

272
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,978
Kids love horses, though.

273
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,241
Well, basically,
she loves cellphones.

274
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,011
But I'm hoping she'll move
into horses eventually.

275
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,022
Hey, really, come on.
Sit down.

276
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,028
Oh, good.

277
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:27,362
They're bonding
with the Pinskis.

278
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,934
[Laughs]

279
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,931
- Five, actually. Five.
- Five.

280
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,562
Then, you're locals, then, huh?

281
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,368
Well, I mean...

282
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,874
I don't want to go that far.

283
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,035
- But...
- Yeah.

284
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,408
We've been here a long time.

285
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,242
Yeah.
Takes time to get there.

286
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,545
I mean, we send everyone
Christmas cards every year.

287
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,585
But haven't got one back yet.

288
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,314
Okay, this is a bit
of a sore point.

289
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,288
But I don't think
it's anything personal.

290
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,824
Did you guys get a card?
I didn't get a card.

291
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,189
I got two cards.

292
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,784
Oh, you're kidding.

293
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,659
- You didn't get a card.
- I got a card.

294
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,823
I didn't get a card.
I'm so upset.

295
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,195
It was about to fall down.

296
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,893
The ceiling was coming down.

297
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,596
Well, you're putting money
back into the community.

298
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,036
Money back into the community.

299
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,405
- That's right, Cooper.
- Money back into the community.

300
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,036
- We always say that.
- Yeah.

301
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,637
How about that blue truck?

302
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,205
- Out front?
- Yeah.

303
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,114
- Is it for sale?
- Oh, yeah.

304
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,846
He wants the truck.
You want the truck?

305
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,251
Well, I might, yes.

306
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,789
- We do?
- We need a second car.

307
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,585
Well, that's news to me.

308
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,057
It's a great truck.

309
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,424
It's a beautiful truck.
I'll do you a good deal on it.

310
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,519
Ray'll do you good.

311
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,895
- You better.
- Oh, I will. [Laughs]

312
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,523
Could use a little work.

313
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,116
Okay, I want you to close
your eyes.

314
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,554
Wonder what this could be.

315
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,989
Here comes a step.

316
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,650
Ready? Step.

317
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,354
Here comes another step.
Ready? Step.

318
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,690
- I'm stepping.
- Whoa.

319
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,664
Okay, our "neigh"bors are here.

320
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,427
Hi, Ray.
Ellen.

321
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,466
- Good morning.
- Hello.

322
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,003
What do you think
Stephanie's holding?

323
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,039
Well, take a look.

324
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,938
- Oh, my God!
- [Laughter]

325
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,477
You guys are the best!

326
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,439
She likes it.

327
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,879
Well, what are you waiting for?

328
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,746
[Neighs]

329
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,115
RAY: See her eyes?
They just lit right up, huh?

330
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,653
She loves it.

331
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,113
Want some coffee?

332
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,351
- Oh, I'd love some.
- Come on in.

333
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,757
She's so surprised.

334
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,226
Hey, Ray.

335
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,230
Hey, good to see you.

336
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,289
COOPER:
Okay. Have fun.

337
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,370
RAY: Don't tell me that
you did this all on your own.

338
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,567
COOPER:
This is my office.

339
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,610
- This is your office?
- Yeah.

340
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:52,940
What's all this stuff?

341
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:56,812
It's all things from the family
that lived here before.

342
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,373
The Massies.

343
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,249
- Look at your garden.
- What's this?

344
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,811
What's this?
Final days?

345
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:06,620
Well, this is a time line
of the Massie family.

346
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,957
That's incredible.
What a project.

347
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,996
Well, it's what I do.
I do documentaries.

348
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,157
- Yeah.
- ELLEN: What's this?

349
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:15,427
Oh, that's the family
that lived here before.

350
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,002
That's the pool.

351
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:20,095
Oh, listen, if you guys want to
swim, come over to our pool.

352
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:23,004
That's... Grady.

353
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,772
- No, it's Lorna.
- Where'd you get that?

00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,176
COOPER:
Oh, these tapes?

355
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,771
Yeah.
They're gonna want that back.

356
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,111
Well, they can have it.

357
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,049
RAY:
You just found the tapes here?

358
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,418
They were in a closet. We bought
the house and the contents.

359
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,820
How much footage do you have?

360
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,324
Oh, miles and miles.

361
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:45,563
Hammerhand will bash your skull

362
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,226
and throw you down
the devil's throat.

363
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,803
Hammerhand will bash your skull.

364
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,280
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

365
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,189
Thanks so much for Chester.
I really love him.

366
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,989
I don't want any present
for the next five years.

367
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,792
Yeah, I really believe that.

368
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,129
I'm glad, honey.
Are you happy here?

369
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,135
I'm so happy.
I really like Stephanie, too.

370
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,864
We like the same kind of stuff.

371
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,640
What about Jesse?
Think he's happy?

372
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,540
I think he's happy.

373
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,876
But he's really into Grady
and all his old stuff.

374
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,177
All his army garments.

375
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,649
Exactly.

376
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:40,978
It's a phase.

377
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,680
I think it's really creepy.

378
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,518
Yeah.

379
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,057
Think he'll go to college
like that?

380
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,526
[Chuckles]
I hope not.

381
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,654
Think they'd send him
back to us?

382
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,392
Yeah.

383
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,592
Actually,
he'd probably like that.

384
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:17,951
Dad.

385
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,821
There's some really,
really weird guy

386
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,484
looking at all your stuff.

387
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,085
What?

388
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,827
May I help you?

389
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,301
Excuse me.

390
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,042
I'm Dale Massie.

391
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,542

392
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,375
Uh, Cooper Tilson.

393
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,573
Nice to meet you.

394
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,115
This is my wife, Leah.

395
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,946
Pleasure, ma'am.

396
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:46,985
Hey, young man.

397
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,884
That's Jesse.

398

Do I smell burning?

401

[Sniffs]

402
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,323
What's cookin'?

403
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,966
[Dale chewing loudly,

404
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,163
Mmm.

405
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,642
Mmm. Mmm.

406

[Belching]

407
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:38,865
That is so gross.

408

[Jesse laughs]

409
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,408
Mmm.

410
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:52,044
That was so tasty, Mrs. Tilson.

411
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,542
Thank you.

412
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,456
Okay.

413
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,757
Speech time.

414
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,387
LEAH:
Kristen, Jesse...

415
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:09,662
why don't you go see
how Chester's doing, okay?

416
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,008
Chester?

417
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,908
It's a pony.

418
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:23,312
Oh.
How nice.

419
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,942
Is it all right if I smoke
in here?

420
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,417
Uh, sure.

421
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,976
Thank you.

422
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,205
It's okay.

423
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,470
This.

424
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,340
It's okay.

425
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,936
[Chester whinnies]

426
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,845
I screwed up.

427
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,846
Bank took everything.
You bought it.

428
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,689
You're doing a great job.

429
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,455
This place is gonna be gorgeous.

430
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,155
Really gorgeous.

431
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,721
Look, uh, Mr. Massie...

432
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,733
Oh. Dale.
Please. Call me Dale.

433
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,168
Dale, I feel...

434
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,671
Well, we feel bad.

435
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,574
If there's anything that you
want to take, go ahead.

436
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,611
It's yours.

437
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:28,408
Please, don't feel bad.

438
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,949
A house is just a shell, right?

439
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,179
I mean, you live in it
for a while.

440
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,914
Then things change.

441
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,450
Now it's yours.

442
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,829
I do have one question
for you, though.

443
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,035
Do you know what you're
getting yourself into?

444
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,677
Restoring this house?

445
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,274
- [Chuckles]
- [Exhales sharply]

446
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,013
Yeah.

447
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,486
We...

448
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,024
We thought that it would take
about two years

449
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:16,858
to just, you know,
to get it kind of...

450
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,523
I just got out of jail.

451
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,773
Three years for an accident
that wasn't my fault.

452
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,749
I need a favor.

453
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,550
I'm asking you both
for a break here.

454
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,518
I really need a job.

455
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,828
Now, I know this house
better than anybody.

456
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,264
I could help you fix it up.

457
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,062
We could start with that pool.

458
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,002
That is one beautiful pool
out there, Mrs. Tilson.

459
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,836
My grandmother put that in
in 1926.

460
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,875
You know that?

461
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,707
I could have you
and the kids in there

462
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,906
by Friday at the latest.

463
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:09,913
Really?

464
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:10,971
Mm-hmm.

465
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,985
I thought it needed relining.

466
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,486
Relining?

467
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,578
[Chuckling]
What?

468
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,623
Who told you that?
That's nonsense.

469
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:21,182
[Clears throat]
Uh...

470
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,489
Well, okay.

471
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:28,192
Why don't we start out
with the pool?

472
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,899
And then we'll see
how it goes from there.

473
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,635
Thank you.

474
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,373
I think we're gonna be
good friends.

475
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,815
I gotta use a rest room.
May I?

476
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:51,857
Yeah, it's right out the hall
and to the...

477
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:55,018
Well, you know where it is.

478
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,119
No sweat, Mr. Tilson.

479
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:15,841
Well, thanks again for dinner.

480
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,780
Yeah. Sure.

a ride.

Okay, be mean.

see how it went.

00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,823
What are you waiting for,
for Christ's sake?

715
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,559
Come on.
Come on.

716
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,763
Come on.

717
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:54,017
Okay. Okay.
I'll talk.

718
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,420
Hoof-and-mouth.
Wiped everything out.

719
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:04,153
Maybe we did cook the books
a little bit.

720
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:06,459
What the hell
you gonna do about it?

721
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:09,056
Nothing, sir.
That was a long time ago.

722
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,566
Bang, went the hammers.

723
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,126
Bang, went the hammers down
till they were all dead.

724
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:14,262
All of them.

725
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,999
Who was dead?

726
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:18,338
10,000 sheep in three days.

727
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:22,072
Bang. Next. Bang. Next.
Bang. Next.

728
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:26,112
And he didn't have
the stomach for it.

729
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,947
"Pooh. Pooh."
[Chuckles]

730
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:30,787
Didn't even kill it.

731
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,255
Wriggling on the floor.
Making noise.

732
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,815
I had to finish him off myself.

733
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:41,559
You see, you have to hold it
like this, you know?

734
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,964
Pop.
One bang in the head.

735
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:46,127
It's better than a bullet.
Cheaper, anyway.

736
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,797
And straight into the brain.
Dead.

737
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:51,102
Give me another cherry.

738
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,972
Down the devil's throat.
[Chuckles]

739
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:04,821
No spine is what happens
when your mama's a whore.

740
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:10,486
Running off with
any old cock of the walk.

741
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:12,029
Piss for brains as well.

742
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:13,757
Give me that.

743
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,166
Here.

744
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:24,174
They'll always be there,
you know.

745
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,539
Thank the Lord.

746
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:29,102
Cold Creek Manor.

747
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,581
Tammy. Grady.

748
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,311
Lorna.

749
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,919
Give me another cherry.

750
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:42,755
I'm sorry, sir.
They're all gone.

751
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:45,762
You little shithead.

752
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,923
Nurse. Nurse.

753
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,329
Nurse!

754
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,265
Nurse!

755
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,265
Now, Mr. Massie.
What's all the yelling for?

756
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,103
COOPER:
Thank you, Mr. Massie.

757
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:58,836
Give my regards
to President Bush.

758
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,934
I sure will.

759
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,445
He means the older gentleman.

760
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:03,605
It was lovely meeting you.

761
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,444
Thank you.
You too.

762
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:06,778
Good luck with the house.

763
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,182
Thank you.

764
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,254
Nice to have a visitor,
Mr. Massie?

765
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:16,953
He's from the President.

766
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,826
[Chuckles] No, he's not.
He bought your house.

767
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:24,767
What you saying,
you stupid little bitch?

768
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:29,367
He owns Cold Creek Manor.

769
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,673
What...

770
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,440
He...

[Door closes]

772

Oh, my God.

778
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,272
Wake up, sleepyhead.

779
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:46,180
Go lay an egg!

780
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,683
Roosters are boys.

781
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:49,310
Shut up!

782
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:53,017
Hey.
Wake up!

783
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:55,286
Go away!

784
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:05,760
I'm gonna make breakfast.

785
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,701
Mmm.

786
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:14,674
- Ah. He makes his own breakfast.
- Oh. Morning, Dad.

787
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,582
Whoa.

Dad!

796

What?

797
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:50,607
- Dad!
- What?

798
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:53,606
There's a big snake!

799
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,612
There's one in my room!

- DALE: You okay, Dec?
- DECLAN: Yeah.

835
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,108
They're coming down.
All right, Jess. You ready?

836
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:36,942
You got a clear path.
You're gonna be okay.

837
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:39,244
My boys are down there.
Hang on to the side.

838
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:41,512
We want to get you
out of the house.

839
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,144
- You got him, Dec?
- Yeah.

840
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,654
Seriously.
No more snakes.

841
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,815
No problem.
Come on. I promise you.

842
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,052
- Hang on to my hand.
- LEAH: You can do it.

843
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:51,321
All right, sweetie.
Hang on to the side.

844
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,885
All right, Mrs. Tilson.
You ready?

00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:54,124
Yeah. No.

out of the house.

Okay?

LEAH:
All right.

850
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:02,733
[Voice breaking]
Oh. Thank you so much.

851

You're welcome.

00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,275
Declan, meet her halfway, okay?

00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,044
Yeah.

Mr. Tilson, take it slow.

COOPER:
Honey. Sweetheart.

860
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,904
They assured us
there's no more snakes.

861
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,843
Hi, Dale.

862
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:50,413
Uh, there's more food
if you're hungry.

863
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,749
No, thanks, Mrs. Tilson.

864
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:57,293
I really came to say goodbye.

865
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:59,994
Where are you going?

866
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:06,203
Listen.
I understand how you feel.

867
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:11,504
Might have been more manly
to tell me to my face, though.

868
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:16,213
You're right.

869
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,511
And I apologize.

870
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:26,282
Well...

871
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,552
It was a pleasure
meeting you all.

872
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,297
LEAH: It was a pleasure
meeting you, Dale.

873
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:42,930
Great job integrating
with the locals.

874
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,499
It's for the best.

875
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,943
The best for who?
You?

876
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,111
Maybe we should go feed Chester.

877
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,673
Why?

878
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,248
Oh.
Miller time.

879
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,984
Jesse, I've told you 18 times
that that's not what it means.

880
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:02,889
Then what does it mean?

881
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,027
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

882
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,858
What is your problem with him?

883
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,402
[Door closes]

884
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:17,532
That guy put the snakes
in our house.

885
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:19,904
Why would he do that?

886
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,138
Because he still thinks
this is his house.

887
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,305
He wants us out.

888
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,110
Oh, come on.

889
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:26,410
I'm sorry, Cooper.

890
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:28,247
But I'm having trouble
relating to this.

891
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,516
Well, you don't seem to have
a hard time relating to him.

892
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:33,352
Meaning what, exactly?

893
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:38,491
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

894
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:50,366
Dave Miller asked me
to sleep with him.

895
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:54,435
What?

896
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,912
Dave Miller.

897
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:06,013
Yeah.
Dave Miller.

898
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,752
Hit on me on the airplane.

899
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:11,056
He offered me the VP spot

900
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:14,655
and then asked me to spend
the night with him in Chicago.

901
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,402
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

902
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,768
I moved out here into the middle
of nowhere with you.

903
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,435
I turned into
some 19th-century housewife.

904
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,375
Which was great for a while.

905
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,573
It felt like this weight
was lifted off my shoulders.

906
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,548
And you were supposed to
carry us through.

907
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,277
But that is not
what's happening.

908
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:36,148
- We're drowning here.
- No. No.

909
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,711
- And it is time to get out.
- No. That's not what I said.

910
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,417
What did you do?

911
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:49,155
I said yes.

912
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:55,499
But then I called you
on the phone.

913
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:57,498
And that was the day

914
00:57:57,608 --> 00:58:01,135
that Jesse was very nearly
killed by that car.

915
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:04,511
Cooper, that was
a wake-up call for me.

916
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:07,577
So...

917
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:14,417
That's why you agreed to
come out here, right?

918
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:16,323

Hey, buddy.

923
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,786
Hey.
Hey. How are you?

924
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,951
I understand
Steph and Kristen,

925
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,461
they're gonna go on a shopping
spree with their moms.

926
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:53,622
Yeah, yeah.

927
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,789
Can I buy you a drink?

928
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,196
Uh, no.
I got to get back.

929
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,063
One beer's not gonna kill you.

930
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,533
No.

931
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,366
Look, Cooper.

932
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:04,839
Word to the wise.
Be cool around here, okay?

933
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:06,877
I didn't come here
to start a war, Ray.

934
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:07,876
Exactly.

935
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:11,540
All I'm saying is come in,
buy a round of drinks.

936
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,947
Show there's no hard feelings
between you and Dale.

937
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,610
What do you say?

938
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:18,654
Come on.
I'll buy you a beer.

939

KRISTEN:
Bastard!

1073
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:46,215
You killed my pony!

JESSE:
Kris. Kris, wait up.

1075
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:49,782
Wait for me!

DECLAN: You want us
to take care of this, Mr. T?

1079
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,351
I didn't do this.

1080
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:02,023
I didn't hit the pony.

1081
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,901
Just leave her alone.
She's crying.

1082
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:15,077
It was Dale.

1083
01:10:15,145 --> 01:10:17,306
Oh.

1084
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,077
Last night at the bar,
there was this thing.

1085
01:10:21,151 --> 01:10:22,311
It was a fight.

1086
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,354
- And Dale and I spoke.
- Were you drinking?

1087
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:34,259
Yes.

1088
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:36,925
But I did not kill Chester.

1089
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,728
How many?

1090
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:47,009
So you were drinking
and you hit a deer.

1091
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,942
You are absolutely sure
that it was a deer?

1092
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:51,344
Yes, I was absolutely sure
it was a deer.

1093
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,941
Leah, you have got to
believe me.

1094
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:58,283
Last night,
Dale, he would've killed Stan

1095
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:01,290
if the sheriff hadn't drawn
a gun on him.

1096
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:03,292
And he punched out
his girlfriend.

1097
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,418
If the sheriff hadn't
been there,

1098
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:05,825
I don't know
what would've happened.

1099
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:09,058
Let's get out of here.
Right now.

1100
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:13,466
From whatever is happening.
Okay?

1101
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:17,267
We promised we would never put
these kids at risk.

1102
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,103
Let's just go back.

1103
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:22,406
Go back to what?

1104
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:27,178
We already sold the house.
There is no place to go back to.

1105
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,710
This is our house.
This is our house.

1106
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:43,489
So what, you're not gonna do
anything about this?

1107
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,158
No.
I didn't say that.

1108
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:47,236
I'm gonna give him
unofficial warning.

1109
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:50,602
I'm gonna tell him to keep off
your property.

1110
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:52,972
That will not do a damn thing.

1111
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,936
Then maybe you should take
your family back to the city.

1112
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:03,885
Hey.

1113
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:06,854
I will not be intimidated
by a thug.

1114
01:12:06,923 --> 01:12:08,686
You have it your own way,
Mr. Tilson.

1115
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,749
I am just trying to help here.

1116
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,853
Why don't you call me when you
got something to show me?

1117
01:12:28,078 --> 01:12:29,841
Hey, Dad.

1118
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:31,437
Hey, son.

1119
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:38,019
Kristen...

1120
01:12:41,624 --> 01:12:43,649
Listen, honey.

1121
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,728
Sweetheart.

1122
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:58,501
I know you think that I did
a terrible thing.

1123
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:02,136
I swear to you
I didn't do it.

1124
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,607
On my life, honey.
I didn't do it.

1125
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,310
Dad wouldn't kill Chester.

1126
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,248
He's probably gonna kill
whoever did it.

1127
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:18,192
All right.
That's enough, Jesse.

1128
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:25,865
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

1129
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:44,584
Then who would do
such a horrible thing?

1130
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:53,493
Hey, fellas.

1131
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:55,428
- Hi.
- Hello.

1132
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:58,492
Is that you, Janice?

1133
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,091
Oh, you're looking good.

1134
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,761
Dale Massie.

1135
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:04,362
When are we gonna have
the pleasure of your company?

1136
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:05,133
Soon.

1137
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,733
I've just been busy sorting
everything out at the house.

1138
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:08,573
Right.

1139
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:10,977
- You walking?
- Yeah.

1140
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,480
He seems like a nice man.

1141
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:13,982
- Who's that?
- Mr. Tilson.

1142
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:17,315
Mm. He's married, Janice.
He's got kin.

1143
01:14:17,387 --> 01:14:18,979
I didn't mean like that, Dale.

1144
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:21,148
I just meant he seems like
a nice guy.

1145
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:23,158
- So you met him, huh?
- Yeah.

1146
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:24,659
Where at?

1147
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:27,491
He came by to visit your father
the other day.

1148
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:29,959
Why?

1149
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,570
He was making a documentary
about the house.

1150
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:37,105
He wanted to ask
some questions.

1151
01:14:52,455 --> 01:14:53,820
Excuse me.

1152
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,163
You are a piece of work, man.

1153
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:07,793
Accusing me of trespassing?

1154
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,668
Did I say anything
when it was my house?

1155
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,367
When I was stuck in jail

1156
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:14,967
and you were caught red-handed
going through the place,

1157
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:16,306
did I say anything?

1158
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:18,176
No, I didn't.

1159
01:15:18,248 --> 01:15:22,708
I didn't say a goddamn thing,
'cause I wouldn't do that.

1160
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:29,152
He had all my personal
photographs...

1161
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:33,662
Lorna and the kids...
all laid out on the table

1162

Can I get a check, please?

Ain't it cool?

You come tap-dancing in here,

1168
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,476
grab the property
out from under a guy

1169
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:50,672
who's late on a few payments.

1170
01:15:52,448 --> 01:15:54,973
Guess what he paid for
the property and the contents.

Joe, take a guess.
What do you think it was worth?

1173
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:00,350
Your place is
about the same size, right?

1174
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,186
Maybe five.

1175
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:06,027

How much are you getting
for that movie about my family?

Huh?

1179
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:19,533
Oh, don't worry.

1180
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:21,201
I'll be sure and buy the DVD

1181
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:23,871

for fixing your pool.

and be a good neighbor, right?

1185
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:39,259

some kind of sadistic prick.

trying to protect your family

1189

But when I've done wrong,

1190
01:16:50,974 --> 01:16:53,169
I own up to it like a man
and I set things straight.

1191
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:55,369
That's what I do, Cooper.

1192
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:58,505
We'll have our time, Massie.
This isn't it.

pointing fingers,

he better be ready
to back it up, don't you think?

with Mrs. Tilson.

01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,455
1,200 acres.

1245
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:29,555
I'll search every inch of it
if I have to.

1246
01:24:29,632 --> 01:24:32,066
[Sighs]
Well, there are two issues here.

1247
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:35,160
Both are relating to
Dale Massie.

1248
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:39,139
He's a piece of shit, all right.

1249
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,698
But I don't think
he's a murderer.

1250
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,141
I don't want to believe it.

1251
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:44,645
I don't want to believe
that he murdered his wife

1252
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:46,943
and his two small kids.

1253
01:24:47,016 --> 01:24:50,179
But he is on to you.

1254
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:54,348
You have absolutely
pissed him off.

1255
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:57,290
You should be careful.

1256
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:59,452
So here's what I'm gonna do.

1257
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:07,125
I'm gonna give you a walkie.

you just holler.

1260

on a regular basis.

just to be sure.

Sweetheart, I am so close.
I swear.

Then everything is gonna be
all right.

all of us.

Leah, do you remember
the other day in the diner

1277
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:32,379
when Jesse shouted something
at Dale?

1278
01:26:32,454 --> 01:26:34,649
Something about
the devil's throat?

1279

You remember that?

That's Lorna's car, all right.

1302
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:48,262
Now, don't get too excited.
It's just circumstantial.

Just take the back road.

You guys should have stayed
in New York.

This isn't the place for you.

Dale, what are you doing?

1531
01:48:11,486 --> 01:48:12,919
What do you want?

1532
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,649
It's a little too late
for "want," Leah.

1533
01:48:15,723 --> 01:48:17,748
"Do" is something, though.

1534
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,622
What am I gonna do?

1535
01:48:19,694 --> 01:48:21,685
I'm gonna smash

How'd you like it down there?
Huh?

down there?

Did you meet them?

01:48:48,723 --> 01:48:51,317
I could have fucked her
anytime I wanted to.

1548
01:48:51,392 --> 01:48:54,190
Just like the rest of them.

Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

1553
01:49:39,307 --> 01:49:41,775
It's only fair
that you should know.

1554
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:45,044
It's gonna be real quick.
Real painless.

1555
01:49:45,112 --> 01:49:46,545
A blow to each of your heads.

1556
01:49:46,614 --> 01:49:48,878
And then I'm gonna throw
your bodies down that hole.

1557
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:50,918
It's that simple.

1558
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:53,317
I got a question for you,
though.

1559
01:49:55,156 --> 01:49:57,317
Do you think I'm nuts?

1560
01:49:57,391 --> 01:49:59,325
Quick.
Yes or no?

1561
01:49:59,393 --> 01:50:00,325
No.

1562
01:50:00,394 --> 01:50:01,884
Wrong.

1563
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:07,326
I got another question.
Yeah.

1564

You know what?
Fuck it.

1565
01:50:11,339 --> 01:50:13,239
