00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,771
<i>Say hello to Idiosa Dartellum 7...</i>

2
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:54,873
<i>...or the ID-7 virus.</i>

3
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:56,756
<i>Nasty-looking little fucker?</i>

4
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:03,449
<i>For the uninitiated, the ID-7 strain
makes stress hormone levels rise...</i>

5
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:06,352
<i>...blocks neural paths,
essentially attacking our id...</i>

6
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:09,656
<i>...and throwing off a very
important balance in our brains...</i>

7
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:16,061
<i>...the balance between emotions and reason
that keep us from doing stupid shit...</i>

8
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,897
<i>...things like punching your boss
in the face when angry...</i>

9
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>...or fucking your date in public when horny.</i>

10
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,970
<i>That balance is temporarily severed,
causing inhibitions to drop...</i>

11
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,373
<i>...and basic instincts
to rise to the surface...</i>

12
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:31,944
<i>...as the infected fall victim to
what experts call emotional hijacking.</i>

13
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:34,880
<i>Social media has tagged it the red-eye virus</i>

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,194
<i>...for obvious reasons.</i>

15
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:46,892
<i>So in a nutshell...</i>

16
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,928
<i>...basic human dignity takes a sick leave.</i>

17
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:53,460
<i>The first reported case of the red-eye
virus occurred 18 months ago...</i>

18
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,201
<i>...in Des Moines, Iowa,
and quickly spread around the world.</i>

19
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:00,070
<i>Since then, there have been over 1,000
confirmed outbreaks reported globally...</i>

20
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,674
<i>...over half of which
are in the United States alone.</i>

21
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,611
<i>The CDC is optimistic they can
contain the virus immediately...</i>

22
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:08,614
<i>...through mandated quarantines,
and the nation will be virus-free...</i>

23
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:11,743
<i>...by the end of the year as antibodies
are being aggressively tested.</i>

24
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:15,921
<i>They also state the virus isn't lethal,
which is technically true.</i>

25
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:21,405
<i>But while the virus can't kill,
the infected, or redders, can.</i>

26
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:25,197
<i>Introducing Mr. Nevil Reed...</i>

27
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:28,712
<i>...the first redder to be officially
cleared for murder.</i>

28
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:42,814
<i>His legal defense alleged that those
infected with the ID-7 strain...</i>

29
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:46,768
<i>...can't control their emotions and therefore
are not liable for the resulting actions.</i>

30
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,271
<i>And thanks to a loophole,
the case was dismissed.</i>

31
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:53,475
<i>So Nevil lost his shit, stabbed a co-worker
repeatedly in the face till dead...</i>

32
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,911
<i>...and walked thanks a doctor's note.</i>

33
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,812
<i>God bless the justice system.</i>

34
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:10,025
<i>Welcome to the home of
Towers & Smythe Consulting...</i>

35
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,894
<i>...the corporate scumbags hired
by the bigger corporate scumbags...</i>

36
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:15,175
<i>...in the landmark Nevil Reed case.</i>

37
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:21,303
<i>TSC is a firm fueled by greed,
duplicity, and moral decay...</i>

38
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:24,584
<i>...a place that ironically screens
their job applicants for honesty...</i>

39
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,865
<i>...loyalty, and integrity.</i>

40
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,649
<i>Qualities I had in spades
when I was fresh-faced...</i>

41
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,184
<i>...and ready to take on the world
my first day here.</i>

42
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:38,687
<i>And here's me six months later...</i>

43
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,323
<i>...late nights, no respect, the bad coffee...</i>

44
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,559
<i>all the shit that comes
with paying your dues.</i>

45
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,527
<i>But none of it could slow me down.</i>

46
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:48,230
<i>I was striving for the success
my family never had...</i>

47
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,500
<i>...a seat at the big kids' table
with all the fixings...</i>

48
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,615
<i>...all while paying back
those goddamn student loans.</i>

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,579
<i>But the higher I rose, the more I felt
like I was losing myself in the process.</i>

50
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,214
<i>And after discovering that loophole
that won the Reed case...</i>

51
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:09,150
<i>...the requisite promotion quickly followed.</i>

52
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,853
<i>But by then, it didn't matter
that I thought he was guilty as fuck.</i>

53
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,889
<i>I just wanted the corner office.</i>

54
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,770
<i>And for my sins, they gave me one.</i>

55
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:21,319
<i>What a dick.</i>

56
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,081
Towers and Smythe.

57
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:59,849
- I mean, how fucking stupid can you get?
- I'm sorry. I...

58
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:02,537
You're sorry? I don't fucking pay you
to be fucking sorry, Jenny.

59
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:05,514
Hey. Morning. Dude, you gotta see this.
You gotta see this. Come over here.

60
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:08,150
- What's up?
- I just got this today.

61
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,798
Oh, man, last year's Christmas party.

62
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:15,262
That looks like you.

63
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:19,288
Yeah. That's you.

64
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:21,289
Where'd you get that?

65
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:23,947
I googled "a small-dick douche
makes assistant work hard...

66
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:27,536
...for fake promise of a raise,"
and it was just, like, top search result...

67
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:30,871
...like, number one.
Listen, leave her alone...

68
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:35,257
...or I'll sell this to your wife for half
of the half she'll get from your divorce.

69
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:37,170
It's a good talk, bro.

70
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,554
Thank you.

71
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,148
- <i>May not be much...</i>
- Morning, Miles.

72
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:49,686
<i>...but I'll take whatever goodwill
I can pillage to sleep better at night.</i>

73
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,822
<i>Thank God for coffee, right?</i>

74
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:57,566
- Your 9:00 a.m. is in meeting room three.
- Where is my coffee cup?

75
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,928
- Don't know. Also, I...
- Do you know who took it?

76
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:04,793
- No. But I can get you another one.
- I don't want another mug. I want my mug.

77
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,203
Yep, David from Vanda Corp.

78
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,693
- Derek. Derek.
- What?

79
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:14,689
- David, line one.
- Okay. Put him on.

80
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,480
David, I was just about to call you.

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,516
<i>David? Who the hell's David? It's Lucy.</i>

82
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:24,185
Miles, this is my sister.

83
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:27,222
- I'm sorry.
- <i>It is so hard to get you on the phone.</i>

84
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:29,791
<i>I just wanted to see if you were
coming up for my birthday next month.</i>

85
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,109
Yeah. No, actually.

86
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,477
I'm so sorry. I will not be able
to make it to your birthday.

87
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:37,799
But I will totally make it up to you.

88
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,570
<i>Well, if you're not gonna show up,
at least paint me something cool.</i>

89
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,772
- How do you know I started painting?
- <i>Miles said you're pretty good.</i>

90
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:45,841
Did he?

91
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,143
<i>Yeah. You should sign up
for art classes or something.</i>

92
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:51,413
I don't have time for art classes.

93
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:54,028
<i>Yeah. You don't have time for anything.</i>

94
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,820
Yes. You are correct.

95
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,990
I do not have time for anything.
I don't have time for this conversation.

96
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,492
- But I love you very much.
- <i>Wait, Derek...</i>

97
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:07,357
Thank you so much for calling.
I gotta go. I love you. Bye.

98
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:19,341
What's my 9:00?

99
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,489
Good morning. Pat Sorenson's office.

100
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,161
Right this way, sir.

101
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,116
How can I help you?

102
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:07,522
My client wants to pay this overdue
debt to reverse the foreclosure.

103
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:10,535
We just need TSC to tell
the bank to allow more time.

104
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,476
I'm sorry to inform you, but our client
has a strong no-refinance policy.

105
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:16,331
Then what do I tell mine?

106
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,763
Would you be open to discussing
the possibility of a deed in lieu?

107
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:26,374
You don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

108
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,443
- You should see a lawyer.
- I am a lawyer.

109
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:31,136
If you were a lawyer,
you would know what a deed in lieu is.

110
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:33,266
You're one of the borrowers, aren't you?

111
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:36,074
So what's a deed in lieu?

112
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:39,632
It doesn't matter.
Bank wouldn't agree to it anyway.

113
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,895
Look, you're not the first borrower
to try to pull this kind of scam.

114
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,999
Miss, this is a non-smoking room.

115
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,547
So come stop me, suit.

116
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:01,922
Wait.

117
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,248
We just need two more months.

118
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:11,770
Families are involved here, but nobody
listens, not the banks, not the lawyers.

119
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,196
I can't get past their damn secretaries.

120
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:18,146
Look, I am very sorry
this is happening to you.

121
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,295
- Then don't kick me out.
- The bank is kicking you out.

122
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,688
- The bank is your client.
- It's the firm's client.

123
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:24,978
The firm's partners call the shots.

124
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:30,453
No one raindrop thinks it caused the flood.

125
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,588
My mother used to say that.

126
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,881
Now I understand what it means.

127
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,316
Is there anything else I can do to help?

128
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:44,819
You can start by telling me the partner
calling the shots on the case.

129
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,901
Sure. That would be...

130
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,564
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

131
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:57,866
Irene Smythe.

132
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:01,563
Well, I want a word with this
Irene Smythe or whoever right now.

133
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,876
Sure. Let me get her on the phone.

134
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:12,180
- This way, ma'am.
- Get off me!

135
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,083
We're not done here!

136
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,852
I'm gonna sue you! I'm gonna sue all of you!

137
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,695
Fuckers!

138
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,163
You're in deep shit, too!

139
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:30,709
You're in deep shit.

140
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:34,869
Brenda wasn't feeling well,
so I had to go out to the penthouse...

141
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:37,008
...to cover for her for a bit.

142
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:42,076
Turns out The Boss is meeting
with Kara and I'm pretty sure...

143
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:45,981
...they were talking about you fucking
up a Vanda Corp case or something.

144
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:49,150
Wait, what? Are you...

145
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,020
I don't work Vanda Corp.
That's Kara's client.

146
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,050
I know, right?

147
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,961
Oh, no.

148
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:20,245
- <i>How can I help you?</i>
- Derek Cho.

149
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,751
- Need an access code to the eighth floor.
- <i>To see whom?</i>

150
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:28,656
<i>Kara Powell, director of operations,
not effective for client matters...</i>

151
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:32,027
<i>...but with all things related to navigating
internal company politics...</i>

152
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,295
<i>...she's fuckin' Mussolini.</i>

153
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,664
<i>We call her The Siren.</i>

154
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:38,832
<i>She's got The Boss's ear.</i>

155
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,037
<i>And her songs are sweet poison.</i>

156
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,501
<i>Mr. Cho.</i>

157
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:49,133
<i>Mr. Cho.</i>

158
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:55,150
To see... Kara Powell.

159
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,068
<i>One moment, please.</i>

160
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,921
Your pass code is 7-8-5-star-9-5.

161
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,635
<i>You expected me to create
a dedicated office mobile app</i>

162
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:16,838
- <i>...with servers that run on hamster wheels.</i>
- Ray, stop talking.

163
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:19,607
If I hear another whining excuse from you...

164
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:23,144
...I'll make sure you're back to building
porn-site banner ads by lunch.

165
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:26,081
- Do you understand me?
- <i>Yes, fine.</i>

166
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,616
So stop playing video games
in your troll cave...

167
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:32,287
...and get the interoffice apps
updated ASAP, okay, sweetie?

168
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:36,051
Okay. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Asshole.

169
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:39,360
- What I can do for you?
- That's a nice mug.

170
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,644
- Where'd you get it?
- I told my assistant to get me one.

171
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:45,467
- And where did she get it?
- Meg!

172
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:49,137
Derek here wants to know
where you got the mug.

173
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:51,039
From a kitchen downstairs.

174
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,677
- Okay. And why did you choose that one?
- Because the other ones were filthy.

175
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:59,347
- And why do you think this one wasn't?
- Because the maid cleaned it.

176
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:02,784
Incorrect. I cleaned this mug
because this mug is mine.

177
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:06,654
And what's mine is mine.
And what's yours is yours.

178
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:09,991
- You're getting to a point.
- Vanda Corp is your client.

179
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:11,893
That blood's on your hands.

180
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:16,531
- So now you wanna share.
- I can't share what isn't mine.

181
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:20,402
Vanda Corp has filed more than 100 account
cases through us in the last two years.

182
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:22,537
Well, then I hope they have
a good case manager.

183
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:27,352
You mean managers. No one can work
a client that big without delegating.

184
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,078
And according to the annual
work distribution sheet...

185
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:32,394
That hasn't been updated in years.

186
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:36,235
...one of Vanda Corp's
complaint cases was assigned...

187
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,682
...to you.

188
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:42,994
File 45A.

189
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:48,099
I'm being set up.

190
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:55,036
Wow. Heads will roll.

191
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,383
- This will cost Vanda...
- Give me this.

192
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:04,697
- This was planted.
- I'll cut you a deal. Plead guilty.

193
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,975
- Not guilty.
- The corpse was found inside your office.

194
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,398
You knew exactly where to find it.

195
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:13,607
- Do you wanna take this upstairs?
- Great idea.

196
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,559
Take your file.

197
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:20,575
Wanna swipe your key card,
or should I swipe mine?

198
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,015
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

199
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,137
You don't have clearance.

200
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:29,959
My bad.

201
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,441
Don't you worry, little one.

202
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:36,589
Daddy will pay for abandoning you
and leaving you to die...

203
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,219
...in that cold, dirty dumpster.

204
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,883
No, no. You died when you drowned
because Mommy left you in the bathtub...

205
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:46,388
...while she went shopping for shoes.
But don't worry. Daddy will make her pay.

206
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,150
Too bad Mommy outranks Daddy.

207
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,431
- Mommy's a backstabbing bitch.
- That's why Mommy outranks Daddy.

208
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,398
- Brenda, what's his mood?
- He's drawing.

209
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:59,081
Oh, shit.

210
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:03,143
<i>John Towers, capital "T" in TSC...</i>

211
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:07,075
<i>...king of the castle, top of the food
chain, and total fucking maniac...</i>

212
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:10,345
<i>...you know, your typical
American success story.</i>

213
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:13,231
<i>Did I mention that he also
dabbles in the fine arts?</i>

214
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,680
Tell me what you see here.

215
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,214
I see that those soldiers' lives
are in danger, sir.

216
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,425
Do you think they'll make it?

217
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:27,679
No, sir. The fuse is too short.
It's too late to run.

218
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,600
And what do you think
they should be doing instead?

219
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,702
May I, sir?

220
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:45,240
So simple and yet so effective.
Can you see it, Derek?

221
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,915
Can you see the solution to our problem here?

222
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:51,218
I think you mean her problem
because she was the one that...

223
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:55,123
Give me the file. This is our bomb.

224
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,625
The fuse is already burning.

225
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,695
So should we run like cowards and die?

226
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:02,597
We are brave, sir.

227
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:04,980
I'm so glad you said that...

228
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,770
...because any second now, Vanda Corp
is gonna find out about this mess...

229
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,306
...and I'm gonna need some scalps.

230
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,645
So, who dropped the ball?

231
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,044
I hate pointing fingers, but may I suggest...

232
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:19,774
...you check the annual work
distribution sheet?

233
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:22,584
Someone cooked the fucking worksheet.

234
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,253
Sir.

235
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,555
Go on.

236
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:30,958
Have you noticed that whenever
there's a problem like this...

237
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:35,217
...it's almost always
the same soldier involved?

238
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:39,647
Because down in the trenches,
we have all noticed.

239
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:44,887
And we wonder if discharging this problem
soldier might be the solution...

240
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:48,779
...to preventing this kind of mess
from ever happening again.

241
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,451
- And who would that be?
- May I?

242
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:11,533
Thank you, Derek. You can leave.

243
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:14,902
- Let's discuss.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,074
- I...
- Leave.

245
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,492
You got a sec?

246
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:53,321
Nothing like a little power meditation.

247
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,386
This one's new.

248
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,116
- Declan's walking already?
- Wobbling, actually...

249
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:01,517
...like you were last Friday night.

250
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,883
- Thanks for the ride, by the way.
- Thanks for puking in my car.

251
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,855
That's what friends are for.

252
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:11,138
So debrief me. What happened?

253
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:14,011
Just found someone else's shit
swept under my carpet.

254
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:16,080
What kind of shit?

255
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,082
Vanda Corp shit.

256
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,918
It's a seven-figure mistake.
I didn't even touch the file.

257
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:22,620
Don't sweat it.

258
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,024
Those clowns working Vanda Corp
are a bunch of a serial screw-ups.

259
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:29,494
Look, I realize you might
not wanna divulge...

260
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,330
The Siren.

261
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,701
All right. Let's take a beat to strategize.

262
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:41,038
Since the promotion, you could possibly
be in charge of a case that big...

263
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:43,908
...but not big enough to be untouchable.

264
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:47,011
That's why she chose you.
You're the perfect fall guy.

265
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,582
So before even taking this upstairs...

266
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:55,156
...you already took this upstairs
and made a mess of things.

267
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,219
Fuck.

268
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,158
Say I punch a rhino in the face.

269
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,695
Would you call that brave or stupid?

270
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:05,596
Brave...

271
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,812
...and stupid.

272
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:10,873
See how bravery and stupidity can overlap?

273
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,782
Now that you understand that, let me give her
a call and see if I can't find a way...

274
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,708
- ...to cut you a deal.
- She already offered me a deal.

275
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:21,546
I told her to suck it and that this is war.

276
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,744
- War is over, moron.
- Come on in, Kara.

277
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:27,728
- How so?
- Natural selection happened.

278
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,339
Pack your shit.
Boxes are on the second floor.

279
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,820
- You're fucking kidding me?
- Derek, calm down.

280
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,223
You blew him, didn't you?

281
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:38,796
Like I need to stoop to that level.

282
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,630
Now...

283
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:44,013
...get the fuck out of my face.

284
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,270
I'm taking this to The Nine.

285
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,974
Sure. Good luck with that.

286
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:52,013
And I want my mug back.

287
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,281
<i>The Nine, the company's board of directors.</i>

288
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:00,885
Good morning, everybody.
This is the Vanda Corp file.

289
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:03,320
<i>No one here goes up or down
without their vote.</i>

290
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,656
<i>Rumor has it that they're actually
cybernetic organisms...</i>

291
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,092
<i>...but that hasn't been
officially confirmed yet.</i>

292
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:11,929
<i>Now, there's a common misconception about
the death gesture during gladiatorial combat.</i>

293
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:16,000
<i>The actual phrase used in Roman texts
doesn't translate as thumbs down...</i>

294
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,432
<i>...but rather thumbs turned.</i>

295
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:21,272
Personally, I think we should hang,
draw and quarter the little fucker.

296
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,849
But... you know, that's just me.

297
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,744
- So let's vote.
- <i>That's because the victors...</i>

298
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:29,980
<i>...finished off their opponents
with a sword thrust across the throat.</i>

299
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,075
So it's unanimous. Call Lester.

300
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:37,488
<i>Enter Lester McGill, head of human resources.</i>

301
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:40,580
<i>No, not her. That guy.</i>

302
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:46,030
<i>He takes care of the firm's layoffs.</i>

303
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,462
<i>He's as cold as his methods
are efficient, a perfect fit here.</i>

304
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:54,139
<i>Naturally, we call him the reaper...</i>

305
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,735
<i>...and he's the last person you want
to see standing at your doorway.</i>

306
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:04,221
Mind if I come in... Derek?

307
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,270
If I said no?

308
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,989
Thank you.

309
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:16,127
Do you even know what happened?

310
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:18,152
I don't care what happened.

311
00:21:18,232 --> 00:21:20,631
You must be good friends with Kara, then.

312
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:24,002
I hope she dies promptly.

313
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:27,070
Glad we're on the same page.

314
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,241
The Nine listen to you,
and I have proof that...

315
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,909
- Sign here...
- ...this was not my mist...

316
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,377
...and here.

317
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:35,313
What the hell are you doing?

318
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:37,768
My job.

319
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,517
So you are on her side.

320
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm on the right side. Always am.

321
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,426
That's why it's me firing you.

322
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:49,062
Fuck you.

323
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:53,860
Sign these documents from upstairs
so I can clear accounting...

324
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,205
...to transfer your severance pay
into your account.

325
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:06,566
Do you know what this is?
This is a statement...

326
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,513
...saying that I take full responsibility
over the Vanda Corp mess.

327
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:12,983
I'll have to file that
under "N" for "not my problem."

328
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:15,186
I could be disbarred.

329
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,418
I could face legal action from the client.

330
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:19,156
I'm just the messenger, Derek.

331
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:22,593
Yelling at me is like yelling
at your watch because you're late.

332
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:25,099
Why would I sign this crap?

333
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:29,403
To get rich.

334
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:33,971
Wow.

335
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:37,345
Glad to see we're now on the same page.

336
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,012
Glad to see I'm not.

337
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:45,816
You want to do this the hard way?

338
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,119
I wanna do this the right way.

339
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:51,252
I wanna speak with him and The Nine.

340
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:53,758
Executive decisions
are not subject to appeal.

341
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:55,893
This one fucking better be...

342
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,796
...because I'm not leaving this
building until I plead my case.

343
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:00,467
Understood.

344
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:45,412
This building is under quarantine.
Get back inside.

345
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:26,951
What's going on here? You can't tell me...

346
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:29,186
- What the...
- ...hell is going on?

347
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:32,312
<i>One of our pathogen sniffers
in the building's ventilation system...</i>

348
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:34,458
<i>...picked up traces of the ID-7 virus.</i>

349
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:37,855
And who authorized you to install
a sniffer in my building anyway?

350
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:41,532
Since the outbreak in Des Moines,
detection devices are now legally required...

351
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:44,842
- ...in public places.
- Des Moines. Fuck.

352
00:24:44,922 --> 00:24:47,805
<i>According to our projections,
those infected in the building...</i>

353
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:52,076
<i>...will begin to display symptoms
soon, if not already.</i>

354
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:56,711
<i>Our experts have already released
a neutralizer into your ventilation system.</i>

355
00:24:56,791 --> 00:25:00,918
<i>All traces of the virus should be
eliminated in approximately eight hours.</i>

356
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:03,891
<i>Until then, this building
is officially under quarantine.</i>

357
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:06,216
So what are we supposed to do
for the next eight hours?

358
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,053
<i>Try to remain calm.</i>

359
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:13,097
<i>So there I was getting the shit kicked out
of me on the lobby floor by this asshole.</i>

360
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:16,118
<i>And then... something...</i>

361
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,372
<i>...happened!</i>

362
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,510
I don't wanna remain calm! I want this fixed.

363
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,743
Hey. It's me. It's me. You all right?

364
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,246
I think I just... I think I just
punched a rhino in the face.

365
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:34,084
- What?
- He attacked me.

366
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:36,657
And then I just kicked his ass.

367
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:41,959
- I'm going to go talk to The Nine.
- No. Fuck this place!

368
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,396
This mess is a blessing in disguise,
trust me. You don't wanna end up like me.

369
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:47,798
What are you talking about?
You have everything figured out!

370
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:53,270
No, Derek. This meditation
and this incense, it's all bullshit.

371
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,862
You think I like the taste of cale?
Come on! I'm fuckin' dead inside.

372
00:25:57,942 --> 00:26:00,811
But they have me wrong. I have to tell them.

373
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,347
Do you have any idea what they're capable of?

374
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:06,951
Just hide out in your office
until the virus subsides...

375
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:09,720
...then walk out those doors
and don't look back.

376
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,457
Free as a bird. All right?

377
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:14,691
- Okay.
- Okay.

378
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:17,027
- Okay.
- Now come on.

379
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:20,577
Put some peanut butter in your
wheatgrass shot. What do you say?

380
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:30,286
- Motherfucker!
- <i>Until the quarantine is over...</i>

381
00:26:30,366 --> 00:26:33,644
<i>...we'll need your cooperation
to keep the situation under control.</i>

382
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:36,913
We know better than anyone else
that this virus...

383
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:39,897
...turns people into maniacs
or blathering idiots.

384
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:43,754
<i>As you may know, the virus triggers
a breakdown of moral barriers...</i>

385
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:47,330
<i>...unleashing repressed emotions
in the infected, including anger...</i>

386
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,295
- <i>...depression, fear, lust.</i>
- Like cocaine?

387
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:54,857
<i>An infected individual would make
a coke addict look like a model citizen...</i>

388
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:57,935
- <i>...by comparison.</i>
- But we still feel normal.

389
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:00,871
<i>The virus can cause drastic mood swings...</i>

390
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:04,171
<i>...with potentially violent
and severe consequences.</i>

391
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:08,178
<i>It would be best if stressful
work-related situations were avoided.</i>

392
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:11,381
Yeah. I'm going to come to your house,
and I'm going to fucking kill you!

393
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,348
- Bye, Mom.
- <i>Antidepressants, stimulants...</i>

394
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:18,055
<i>...even caffeine can accelerate
the virus's effect.</i>

395
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:21,565
Meg, make more fucking coffee!

396
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:33,838
So, what happens when 287 employees...

397
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:39,610
...with average billing rates
of $200 an hour...

398
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,384
...stop working for eight hours?

399
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,622
You don't know?

400
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,676
I lose half a million dollars!

401
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:59,059
Now, crack your whips.
Everybody goes back to work.

402
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:02,516
And if they don't like it,
they are terminated immediately...

403
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:05,656
...and no severance packages.
Put the fear of me in them.

404
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:09,840
- What now?
- <i>Derek Cho wants clearance to come up.</i>

405
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,176
- What for?
- <i>He said he reconsidered...</i>

406
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:15,482
<i>...but he wants to have a word
with you and The Nine first.</i>

407
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:21,743
<i>Your pass code is 8-star-1-9-9, fuck-head.</i>

408
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:31,198
Fuck you!

409
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:35,466
No, no. No, up.

410
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:39,178
Up. Up. Let me the fuck up!

411
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,978
<i>Colton Snyder...</i>

412
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,276
<i>...aka The Bull...</i>

413
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:51,737
<i>...The Boss' unofficial left hook.</i>

414
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,253
<i>Nobody knows his exact job description.</i>

415
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,655
<i>But whenever there's a hint
of something dirty going on...</i>

416
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:01,562
- Take his phone.
- <i>...there he is.</i>

417
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,944
<i>Hello, Derek.</i>

418
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:17,540
<i>Look, I am so sorry we didn't get
a chance to meet again.</i>

419
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,344
<i>Things came up. You know how it is.</i>

420
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:22,433
<i>Now, I know what you're thinking...</i>

421
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:26,603
"Nevil Reed, he got away with murder.
Maybe I can have a little fun here."

422
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:31,255
Did you really think
that I didn't see that coming?

423
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:34,641
Actually, I was just gonna
ask for my job back.

424
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:37,511
<i>But I like your idea, too.</i>

425
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,846
<i>Well, I'm going to beat you to the punch.</i>

426
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:45,285
Now, that sounds like it hurt. Is he hurt?

427
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:48,606
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Is he crying?</i>

428
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:52,681
- No, sir.
- <i>Well, why isn't he fucking crying?</i>

429
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:02,312
He is now, sir.

430
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,391
<i>Now, I wanna hear a bone break.</i>

431
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,309
They say the femur is the most difficult
bone in the body to break...

432
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,276
...but I'll settle for a pinkie.

433
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:12,366
I'm coming, Derek.

434
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:21,708
- What's happening?
- Motherfuckers!

435
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,220
Can someone tell me
what the fuck is going on in there?

436
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,199
Ewan?

437
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:50,903
I... smell...

438
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:55,008
...toast.

439
00:30:58,555 --> 00:31:00,076
Ewan.

440
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:02,779
- Ewan! Ewan!
- Ewan?

441
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,081
<i>Ewan!</i>

442
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:08,574
- You killed Ewan?
- There's been an accident.

443
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:13,470
Do you have any idea how many billable hours
I'm gonna lose until I find a replacement?

444
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,909
I'm worried about the body
right now. I killed him.

445
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:21,165
You didn't kill him.
The virus killed him. You're infected.

446
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:25,642
You have impunity!
We have a precedent in Nevil Reed.

447
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:28,108
- <i>You can thank Derek for that.</i>
- Motherfucker.

448
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:30,210
Thank you for that, Derek.

449
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:34,081
<i>Lock him up with the other one
and then get back up here.</i>

450
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,587
- What are you doing here?
- They fired me.

451
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:37,331
That's nice. Justice is served for once.

452
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:38,608
What are you doing here?

453
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:42,379
Security called the cops, but this place was
quarantined before they could show up...

454
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,848
...so they threw me in this hellhole.

455
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:49,085
I'm suing everyone and their grandmother
when I get out of here, I swear to God.

456
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,788
Good luck. It's ID-7!

457
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:54,300
No one's liable for anything that they do.

458
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:58,460
- Just like any other day for you.
- Yeah.

459
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,564
We're not liable for what
we do in here, either.

460
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:04,333
Nice, then I'll have your balls
for dinner for that shit you pulled!

461
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:07,918
Wait! Wait! Wait! This might sound crazy,
but I think we can help each other out here.

462
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:12,916
Okay? You remember Irene Smythe,
the woman that fucking screwed you?

463
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:15,379
She's in the building's penthouse right now.

464
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:18,546
- So what?
- You help me get to the top...

465
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:20,927
...and she's all yours.

466
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:25,289
This is our shot to hold
these assholes accountable...

467
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:27,997
...for all the fucking damage
that they've done!

468
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,495
And our chance goes away
as soon as this quarantine is over.

469
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:33,664
Yeah?

470
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:38,128
- Can I get up now?
- Are you gonna stop being an asshole?

471
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:41,903
That's debatable. Yes. Yes.

472
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:04,560
- What are you looking for?
- A loophole.

473
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,464
It's my specialty.

474
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,436
Yeah!

475
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:14,704
I don't think they'd lock us up
in a room with working phones.

476
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,472
I don't need a working phone.

477
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:20,314
Just need bit of this, a bit of that.
Build a franken-phone.

478
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,826
And call who? Cops can't enter the building.

479
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:24,774
I'm not calling the cops.

480
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:31,221
Sir? Derek Cho somehow managed to
set up a call with Vander Corp's CEO...

481
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:33,393
...and they wanted you to join in.

482
00:34:36,356 --> 00:34:38,251
In a minute.

483
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:42,632
Sorry to keep you waiting, Frank.
I'm all ears!

484
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,418
<i>Glad you could join us, John.</i>

485
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:48,271
<i>Well, I've been having a nice,
long chat with one of your lawyers.</i>

486
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:52,008
- <i>You still there, Derek?</i>
- Yes, sir. I am still here.

487
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:55,312
<i>Good. John, can you please remind me?</i>

488
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:57,938
<i>Why do I do business with TSC?</i>

489
00:34:58,018 --> 00:35:00,350
Well, because it's a jungle out there, Frank.

490
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:05,255
And not only do you need a guide, but you
also need a lion walking right by your side.

491
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:08,625
And we are your lion and your guide.

492
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:09,893
- <i>Are you?</i>
- Yeah.

493
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:14,966
<i>Well, we're just a touch concerned
that you may have ulterior motives.</i>

494
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:19,102
<i>We would never turn
against our clients, Frank.</i>

495
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:23,927
<i>Well, that may be true, but Derek has
alerted me to a certain document...</i>

496
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:27,074
<i>...that seems to suggest otherwise.</i>

497
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:30,380
It's a report that TSC did for Vander Corp.

498
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,750
It analyzes the advisability
of filing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit...

499
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,096
...against one of Frank's
ex-business associates.

500
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,788
<i>Do you remember this report, John?</i>

501
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:42,516
- No.
- <i>I must say, it's well-written.</i>

502
00:35:42,596 --> 00:35:46,430
<i>I like how it weighs the slim possibility...</i>

503
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,022
<i>...of a positive financial outcome...</i>

504
00:35:49,102 --> 00:35:53,820
<i>...against the enormous
potential litigation costs.</i>

505
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,339
<i>Do you agree with this report, Derek?</i>

506
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,444
No, sir. I do not. I believe
you could have won the suit.

507
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:04,214
<i>Then why did your advisers
advise me against it?</i>

508
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:07,791
<i>Your advisers missed
the deadline to file the motion.</i>

509
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:11,337
<i>So you believe that TSC
dropped the ball on this one?</i>

510
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,957
<i>I believe they dropped the ball, sir.</i>

511
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:16,723
<i>But then they also defecated on the ball...</i>

512
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:20,230
...and then sodomized the ball, sir.

513
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,283
<i>Interesting.</i>

514
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,774
<i>Oh, and, John...</i>

515
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:28,325
<i>...I just happen to have
your last invoice here with me.</i>

516
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:38,564
That went well.

517
00:36:41,163 --> 00:36:43,487
I want you to rip the fucking
phone out of his hands...

518
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,777
...his hands off his fucking body now!

519
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:57,100
Yeah. Can I please order two
pepperoni pizzas and some hot wings?

520
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,236
Yeah. Why not?
Throw some garlic bread in there.

521
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:02,542
Do you guys want anything?

522
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:25,899
Brenda! This fucking phone doesn't work!

523
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,107
Yeah.

524
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:41,064
Christ, man! He fuck your girl, too?

525
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:45,982
Damn, suit,
you don't even respect each other.

526
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:47,893
You're right.

527
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,307
We don't.

528
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:55,038
Now what?

529
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,909
Time to go to work.

530
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:30,760
- Fuck, yeah!
- Oh, shit.

531
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,484
They started a countdown for the
quarantine, posted in an interoffice app.

532
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:37,367
It's enough time to get the job done.
I mean, this place isn't that big.

533
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:41,104
The Boss is a fucking raging cokehead.
There's definitely gonna be more guards.

534
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,456
Fine. I'll bring more nails.

535
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:45,742
The only way to the top floor is with
the key card or a one-time password.

536
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:47,917
So who do we have to fuck up to get the card?

537
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:52,716
First, there's an ass-hat on the sixth
floor who's got a level-two key card.

538
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:55,685
<i>It can take us to the seventh floor,
giving us access to the bitch...</i>

539
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:57,867
...who's got a level-three key card.

540
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:07,869
Hey, extreme measures, right?

541
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,271
- Wednesdays.
- Hey!

542
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:54,147
- Him?
- Yep.

543
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:02,956
Hey!

544
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:12,328
- Open the fucking door!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

545
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:14,931
You open doors like my grandmother fucks!

546
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,903
Open the door!

547
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:22,712
Open the fucking door!

548
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,821
Open the door!

549
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:13,822
It really bothers me that women don't
get the same treatment as men...

550
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:15,865
...in the workplace.

551
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:19,345
I'm all about gender equality here.

552
00:41:23,296 --> 00:41:24,871
Derek!

553
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,742
- Need a hand?
- I don't need your help, suit.

554
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:05,608
- But I need yours.
- Fuck you.

555
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:07,547
Fuck you, too.

556
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:15,184
- May we come in?
- And if I said no?

557
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:17,787
You'll have to confer with my associate.

558
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,760
And mine, gimpy.

559
00:42:26,642 --> 00:42:28,464
- What do you want?
- Key card.

560
00:42:28,544 --> 00:42:31,067
I'm not the only one
with a level-two key card.

561
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:34,838
But you are the one that fired me, asshole!

562
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:39,322
Wrong. The firm fired you.
Don't nail-gun the messenger.

563
00:42:41,824 --> 00:42:43,713
Oh, my God.

564
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:46,616
You bring up a very good point.

565
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:49,218
I'm so sorry, Lester. We're good.

566
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:51,554
We're totally good, man.

567
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,990
I will take it up with the firm...

568
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,794
...but I would love to know
where I could find the firm...

569
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:02,098
...because I would love
to kick the firm's ass.

570
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:05,268
You can't kick a firm's ass.

571
00:43:05,681 --> 00:43:07,503
That's the point.

572
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:12,277
Well, then that brings us back to you.

573
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:16,149
I was just doing my job.

574
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,950
No one raindrop thinks it caused the flood.

575
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,352
I get what that means.

576
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:25,418
You know what will happen to me
if I give you this key card?

577
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:28,358
I'm going to have to file that under "N..."

578
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:31,619
...for "not my fucking problem."

579
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,276
Fuck!

580
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,182
No! The saw!

581
00:43:53,262 --> 00:43:55,151
Extreme measures!

582
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:56,853
Go!

583
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:16,575
A little help?

584
00:44:26,662 --> 00:44:28,451
You ready?

585
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:30,386
It's gonna hurt a lot.

586
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,688
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

587
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:35,358
- You're still one of them.
- I thought we were a team.

588
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:39,298
For the time being.
All right. On the count of...

589
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:45,834
All right. Calm down.

590
00:44:46,123 --> 00:44:47,707
Fuck.

591
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:51,494
At least you're not that guy.
Move aside, pussies. Come on.

592
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:54,500
Wait. Wait. I have an idea.

593
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:07,823
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
You're cool! Fuck you!

594
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:11,381
- Are we done here yet?
- We are now.

595
00:45:13,391 --> 00:45:16,832
Here, take my phone.
I need you to film something.

596
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:21,504
- Film what?
- <i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

597
00:45:21,984 --> 00:45:26,783
<i>Case file 32376, The People vs. Reed.</i>

598
00:45:27,473 --> 00:45:29,378
<i>Now, you all know the court case...</i>

599
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:33,149
<i>...but let's discuss Mr. Nevil Reed
the man, shall we?</i>

600
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:38,221
<i>By all accounts, Mr. Reed was
an upstanding pillar of the community...</i>

601
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:41,451
<i>...earned two master's degrees
by the age of 21.</i>

602
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:46,362
<i>He married his college sweetheart
and is the father of beautiful twin girls.</i>

603
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:51,491
But when Mr. Reed contracted the ID-7 virus...

604
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,372
...shit got real.

605
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:57,273
"Overwhelmed by pure id...

606
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:00,543
...Nevil Reed became prone to involuntary...

607
00:46:00,623 --> 00:46:04,047
...aberrant, and shocking impulses.

608
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:07,467
He committed a gruesome, unspeakable act...

609
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:12,729
...in broad daylight
in a room full of witnesses."

610
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:18,375
<i>Now, we're witnessing a model citizen here...</i>

611
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:21,998
<i>...transformed into a brutal...</i>

612
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:25,401
...bloodthirsty killing machine...

613
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:28,738
...at the blink of an infected eye.

614
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:31,174
So I ask you this.

615
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:35,448
Is it his fault or is it the virus's?

616
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:43,298
Let's discuss.

617
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:46,209
See you soon, fuckers.

618
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,996
Shit.

619
00:46:55,244 --> 00:46:58,367
Kara, he's on his way up.
He has got Lester's key card.

620
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:02,105
<i>Oh, really? That's a shame,
a real shame, sir.</i>

621
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:07,076
Just wondering, did they get it before or
after butchering Lester with an electric saw?

622
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:10,299
Just calm down and come up here!

623
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:13,716
They're guarding the private elevator.
I can't leave the office.

624
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:17,620
- Then destroy the card.
- It's my only leverage.

625
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,979
Kara, I promise you...

626
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:24,057
<i>...I will do everything in my power
to ensure he doesn't get to you.</i>

627
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:27,777
But if he does,
you must protect those above you.

628
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:29,155
Fuck those above me!

629
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:32,201
- I'll give you the raise you always wanted.
- Fuck your raise!

630
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:36,047
- I'll make you partner.
- Fuck your...

631
00:47:36,393 --> 00:47:39,232
Deal. I'll throw it out the window.

632
00:47:39,312 --> 00:47:41,195
Oh, thank you.

633
00:47:51,637 --> 00:47:52,959
Meg!

634
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:58,994
Hide this somewhere safe
and don't tell me where.

635
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:01,884
And make more fucking coffee now!

636
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,703
Stupid bitch.

637
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:13,482
The elevator's the only way upstairs.
We can ambush her here.

638
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,633
Well, it's gonna be a while.

639
00:48:17,293 --> 00:48:19,282
Top three bands, go.

640
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:22,051
- Only three?
- Only three, that's the rules.

641
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:23,987
All right.

642
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,239
Motorhead.

643
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,499
D.R.I. and Early Anthrax.

644
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:33,028
- Metal till I fucking puke.
- All right. Okay.

645
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:35,906
That's not what I expected, but fine choices.

646
00:48:35,986 --> 00:48:38,501
What did you expect, the Dave Matthews Band?

647
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:40,870
Hey, Dave Matthews Band is actually...

648
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,672
Other way, asshole. Go.
Turn around. Yep. You got it.

649
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:46,776
- You fucking dick, Joe!
- What?

650
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:49,445
Dave Matthews Band is a good band.

651
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:52,081
- Oh, my God.
- You ever heard them live?

652
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:55,184
I would rather chew glass.

653
00:48:55,264 --> 00:48:56,285
Are you serious?

654
00:48:56,365 --> 00:49:00,489
Just because they're popular
doesn't mean that they're bad at music.

655
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:04,059
I think it's actually that people think
it's more popular to dislike them...

656
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:06,065
...so they're just trying
to be cool. It's bullshit.

657
00:49:06,145 --> 00:49:07,863
All right. Fine.
I'll go see them at Burning Man.

658
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:11,306
All right, make fun all you want,
but if we ever get out of here...

659
00:49:11,386 --> 00:49:15,337
...I'm gonna get us tickets, all right,
to the coliseum show in July.

660
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:18,294
I'm gonna take you there and I'm gonna
turn you on to some great musicianship.

661
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:23,216
You're gonna turn me on? Before or
after we go out to buy birkenstocks?

662
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:25,848
- Fuck off.
- Do you wear them with socks? I bet you do.

663
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:28,517
Okay. So... so just tell me again...

664
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:32,355
...why you can't send a unit in
to just stop this asshole.

665
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,591
<i>A heavily armed SWAT team
in a building filled with civilians...</i>

666
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:38,994
<i>...infected with the virus
would be catastrophic.</i>

667
00:49:39,074 --> 00:49:43,565
<i>...for that, we need to...
excuse me. What are you doing?</i>

668
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:46,936
Allergies. Who are you, my fucking therapist?

669
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:49,862
<i>Anyway, all we can do
is talk to the employee...</i>

670
00:49:49,942 --> 00:49:52,375
<i>...in an attempt to defuse the situation.</i>

671
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,477
<i>We currently have a psychologist on-site...</i>

672
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:57,150
<i>...who could possibly talk
to the infected individual.</i>

673
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:06,575
Notify the team down in accounting.
I'm offering 150 grand for Cho's head.

674
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:09,142
You're talking about murder here.

675
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:12,054
You should be offering at least 450.

676
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,566
Agreed.

677
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:34,267
Four hours left till the quarantine lifts.
We're running out of time.

678
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:38,521
Well, sometimes you gotta say,
"what the fuck?

679
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,807
- Make your move."
- "Risky business."

680
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:42,459
Yeah.

681
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:45,314
All right.

682
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:12,515
<i>Hello, Derek? My name's Mark.
I'm a psychologist working with the CDC.</i>

683
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:15,217
- <i>Can you hear me?
</i>- Yes, he can hear you, Mark.

684
00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:18,020
<i>I was just told that you were
under a bit of stress right now...</i>

685
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,149
<i>...so I wanted to check in on you.
Can we talk?</i>

686
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,611
<i>Can you tell me how you feel?</i>

687
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:27,763
How do I feel?

688
00:52:29,822 --> 00:52:33,232
I feel like taking my clothes off.

689
00:52:33,312 --> 00:52:37,228
I feel like causing extraordinary amounts...

690
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:40,345
...of property damage.
I feel like I wanna scream.

691
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:45,048
I wanna fuck. I feel like
twisting limbs and breaking bones!

692
00:52:46,328 --> 00:52:49,952
- I feel great, Mark.
- <i>That's the virus talking.</i>

693
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:53,689
I agree, Mark.
Derek isn't thinking clearly right now.

694
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:57,264
He's so consumed by his id
that he hasn't noticed that...

695
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,496
- ...we're just here to help him.
- <i>You should listen to her, Derek.</i>

696
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:03,833
<i>Why don't you sit down,
take a breath, and talk it out?</i>

697
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:06,271
Talk it out.

698
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:16,745
Sure.

699
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:21,717
- I'll talk it out.
- <i>Yeah. Let's just have a conversation.</i>

700
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:23,655
Track three.

701
00:53:28,293 --> 00:53:31,133
Better not be fucking Dave Matthews Band.

702
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:33,796
Okay.

703
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:38,501
Those of you who don't wanna
be a part of this can leave now.

704
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:42,037
- <i>Derek, please listen to me.</i>
- But if you choose to stay...

705
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:44,777
...which it seems
like you guys are choosing...

706
00:53:44,857 --> 00:53:47,743
- <i>Derek, please.
</i>- ...you understand and agree...

707
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:49,878
...to the following terms and conditions.

708
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,780
- <i>Derek!</i>
- One...

709
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,483
- <i>Derek, this is the virus talking.</i>
- ...you hereby waive your right...

710
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:57,186
- <i>Derek, please.</i>
- ...to your own personal bodily integrity.

711
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:59,321
- <i>This is not you.</i>
- Two...

712
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:02,297
- <i>I'm a licensed psychologist.
</i>- ...per the State vs. Nevil Reed...

713
00:54:02,377 --> 00:54:05,294
...my colleague and I
will not be held criminally liable...

714
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:09,131
...for any felony or misdemeanor
that you may be a victim of...

715
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:13,669
<i>...including but not limited
to aggravated assault...</i>

716
00:54:13,749 --> 00:54:16,672
...aggravated battery, disorderly conduct...

717
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:21,216
...destruction of property, mayhem,
and first-degree murder.

718
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:22,926
And, three...

719
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,990
...terms and conditions
may change or be updated...

720
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,519
...whenever the fuck I want!

721
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:35,998
Consider yourselves notified.

722
00:55:54,616 --> 00:55:56,171
<i>Hello?</i>

723
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:58,607
<i>Derek?</i>

724
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:00,530
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

725
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,614
Knock, knock.

726
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:11,917
Key card, <i>por favor.</i>

727
00:56:13,602 --> 00:56:16,432
If you want it, you'll have to negotiate.

728
00:56:17,272 --> 00:56:20,162
Negotiations have ended.

729
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:24,396
Well, so will the quarantine,
and I don't know where the key card is.

730
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:28,770
- What do you want?
- A truce.

731
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:31,373
Fuck your truce.

732
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:34,296
No truce, no key card.

733
00:56:36,892 --> 00:56:38,717
All right.

734
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,888
Tell me where it is, and I promise...

735
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:46,425
...I'll be on my way and leave you alone.

736
00:56:48,586 --> 00:56:50,991
You're a man of your word, Derek.

737
00:56:52,407 --> 00:56:54,831
That's why I believe you.

738
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:59,371
And that's... that's why
you never made partner.

739
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:03,338
Key card. Key card, Derek.

740
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:05,611
Don't be stupid now.

741
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:11,563
There's a good boy. Meg!

742
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:13,484
Yeah, Meg!

743
00:57:20,168 --> 00:57:22,574
Take your key card, Derek, and fuck off.

744
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:24,760
What card?

745
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,082
All I see is a useless piece
of scorched plastic on the table.

746
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:31,808
Strange.

747
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:35,396
Me too. Is that what you see, too, Meg?

748
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:38,607
- Yep.
- So tell me, Meg, sweetie...

749
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:43,932
...why did you bring me this useless
piece of plastic instead of my key card?

750
00:57:44,012 --> 00:57:47,249
Oh, that is your key card,
or it used to be...

751
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:50,152
...before I put it inside a microwave oven.

752
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:52,496
And why would you do that, I wonder?

753
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:58,494
You're exactly like
every other assistant, Meg.

754
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:03,432
You're a vapid, bottom-feeding,
parasitic shithead!

755
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:07,826
You're a pair of tits with zero talent.

756
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:10,906
So tell me, Meg, you incompetent cunt...

757
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:14,413
...what could possibly possess you
to destroy my key card?

758
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:17,713
Because everyone upstairs
knew you would betray them.

759
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:21,884
So they offered me a promotion
in exchange for destroying the card.

760
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:23,352
So...

761
00:58:23,432 --> 00:58:27,676
...I guess I no longer work for you,
you fucking bitch.

762
00:58:28,186 --> 00:58:31,794
In fact, I don't have to listen...

763
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:36,571
...to your hideous, shrill voice ever again!

764
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:39,157
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

765
00:58:57,531 --> 00:59:01,336
Now it's a party! Oh, my God! Yes!

766
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:04,293
<i>Hey, just wanted to say...</i>

767
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:08,067
<i>...no more lies, no more power games...</i>

768
00:59:10,644 --> 00:59:12,501
<i>...no more bullshit...</i>

769
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:14,506
<i>...and...</i>

770
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,228
<i>...no more siren song.</i>

771
00:59:18,752 --> 00:59:23,559
<i>By the way, Meg, she's a little crazy.</i>

772
00:59:24,393 --> 00:59:26,250
<i>She's perfect here.</i>

773
00:59:37,939 --> 00:59:40,362
Dude, that freak show had
some super-good-quality shoes.

774
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:42,429
These are comfy as fuck!

775
00:59:44,029 --> 00:59:45,836
I loved this mug.

776
00:59:53,554 --> 00:59:57,922
I got it on the first day
that I started here.

777
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,185
My sister gave it to me.

778
01:00:07,402 --> 01:00:09,194
Fuck this place.

779
01:00:13,758 --> 01:00:15,769
Do you still have that...

780
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:18,640
...foreclosure paperwork on you?

781
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,872
Yeah.

782
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:27,779
- Why?
- Let me take a little look at it.

783
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:36,986
What?

784
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:40,323
You're in luck.

785
01:00:41,503 --> 01:00:43,759
This mortgage is part of a bad batch.

786
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,730
Original paperwork was filed so many
times that it'd be tough to find.

787
01:00:49,215 --> 01:00:51,033
Could even be lost.

788
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:54,269
So if I ask the bank
for the original paperwork...

789
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:56,241
You'd put them in a tough spot.

790
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:04,379
Or a signature from upstairs
could void it completely.

791
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:06,317
Really?

792
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:12,098
Hey, I'm sorry...

793
01:01:12,178 --> 01:01:15,793
...for not helping you earlier.

794
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:20,530
I should've, but I didn't.

795
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,465
It's okay.

796
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:25,822
Just don't do it again, I guess.

797
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:36,812
<i>You rolling?</i>

798
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,215
<i>Push back. Push back.</i>

799
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:42,385
<i>All right. Stop.</i>

800
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:45,096
<i>Can you see him?</i>

801
01:01:49,571 --> 01:01:51,160
No.

802
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,632
<i>Fuck you, Derek.</i>

803
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:01,402
Is that your friend?

804
01:02:01,482 --> 01:02:03,372
Oh, God.

805
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:06,109
Hey, give that to me.

806
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:10,415
Hey. Hey, it's all right.

807
01:02:13,328 --> 01:02:15,386
He has kids.

808
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:22,357
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

809
01:02:22,737 --> 01:02:24,627
I'm sorry.

810
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:27,395
This fucking virus, it just takes...

811
01:02:27,475 --> 01:02:30,099
...just takes everything up to 11.

812
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:32,871
I've noticed.

813
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:35,907
Hey.

814
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:45,774
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

815
01:03:45,854 --> 01:03:48,276
- I like this virus.
- Yeah.

816
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:50,244
So what now?

817
01:03:51,224 --> 01:03:53,481
I think we should definitely
exchange numbers...

818
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:55,950
...consider an apartment, maybe a dog.

819
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,920
- That'd be nice.
- No, you idiot! What now?

820
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,193
Let's see.

821
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:09,531
- Ray sent an update to the office staff.
- Who's Ray?

822
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:11,469
He's the IT guy.

823
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:14,036
Fuckers.

824
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,805
There must be another way
we can get up there.

825
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:18,766
Not without the key card.

826
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:22,111
Unless...

827
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:26,081
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

828
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:28,466
Unless what?

829
01:04:29,096 --> 01:04:30,759
What's he want?

830
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:34,492
Ray can't fix the elevators,
but I have another idea.

831
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:41,730
- Ray!
- I'm really busy right now!

832
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,429
Goddamn it! Fuck you!
Why won't you fucking work?

833
01:04:45,509 --> 01:04:46,954
Ray!

834
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:50,238
Hey.

835
01:04:50,518 --> 01:04:52,807
- Hi.
- Hey.

836
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:54,710
We need your help.

837
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,812
Holy shit! How'd that happen?

838
01:04:57,892 --> 01:05:01,149
Well, we asked for his help,
and then he said he was busy.

839
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:02,798
Really?

840
01:05:03,097 --> 01:05:04,679
Welcome to IT.

841
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:07,289
We need you to hack into someone's computer.

842
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:11,261
And I need Interpol to get off my back,
so what else is fucking new?

843
01:05:13,441 --> 01:05:16,254
- Who we talking about?
- Irene Smythe.

844
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:17,754
Oh, fuck her.

845
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:24,302
What? What the...

846
01:05:28,756 --> 01:05:31,546
- IT department.
- <i>What's wrong with my computer?</i>

847
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:34,012
Doctor can't do much
until you tell him where it hurts.

848
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:37,482
My Internet is slower than your brain.

849
01:05:37,562 --> 01:05:42,040
Well, that's a miracle considering the budget
that I have for installs and updates.

850
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,269
<i>Seriously, how do you expect me to keep
running things if you have one guy...</i>

851
01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:49,681
<i>...in one room down in the fucking
basement doing everything?</i>

852
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:54,139
<i>Seriously, and what do I get? I get
denial, denial, denial, denial, denial...</i>

853
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:58,523
<i>...on all my fucking budgets, right?
But, "oh, Ray, please give me an app!</i>

854
01:05:58,603 --> 01:06:00,491
- <i>Make sure..."</i>
- I am shocked!

855
01:06:00,571 --> 01:06:03,094
I'm shocked and appalled, and
I'll definitely bring this up with John...

856
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:05,830
<i>...but in the meantime,
can you do your fucking job?</i>

857
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:09,000
Cool your bloomers. Hold on.

858
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,303
- Just sent you a patch.
- A patch?

859
01:06:11,383 --> 01:06:15,994
It's a file that you install on that thing
in front of you called a computer.

860
01:06:16,274 --> 01:06:17,316
Okay.

861
01:06:17,396 --> 01:06:21,152
Look, this might get complicated
for you, but don't worry.

862
01:06:21,232 --> 01:06:23,738
I'll take you through the whole
process myself. You ready?

863
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:24,849
Okay.

864
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:26,918
<i>Click on the file that's on your desktop.</i>

865
01:06:26,998 --> 01:06:30,660
- Done.
- Now click "install."

866
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:36,794
So rude. You know...

867
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:41,235
...funny enough, I think
the virus actually made her nicer.

868
01:06:43,414 --> 01:06:47,572
I could've called that file mean Trojan
destroyer, the ultimate hard drive rapist...

869
01:06:47,652 --> 01:06:49,714
...and she still would have installed it.

870
01:06:51,022 --> 01:06:53,128
And we're in.

871
01:06:53,858 --> 01:06:56,681
Okay. So what we're looking at,
those are her files?

872
01:06:56,761 --> 01:06:59,584
Every last one of them, even the porn.

873
01:06:59,664 --> 01:07:02,721
Seems she's got a thing for feet.
What do you want?

874
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:05,857
I want you to pretend
that that is a peaceful village...

875
01:07:05,937 --> 01:07:08,460
...inhabited by gorgeous virgin maidens.

876
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:13,799
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you're the...
you know, smelly, aggressive viking king.

877
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:16,754
You had me at peaceful.

878
01:07:19,056 --> 01:07:20,941
What... what the...

879
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:26,010
Ray, you ignoramus,
that patch thing has erased my hard drive.

880
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:31,129
<i>Hey, Irene. I got good news,
bad news, and worse news for you.</i>

881
01:07:31,209 --> 01:07:34,979
Good news is, is we have a copy
of your hard drive on the backup server.

882
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:38,370
Bad news is that I have it.

883
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:42,027
Worse news is that, if you want it...

884
01:07:42,107 --> 01:07:44,733
...you gotta come down and get it.

885
01:07:47,851 --> 01:07:51,072
- What trade?
- The backup copy for my key card.

886
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:56,207
That backup is worth millions to this firm.
Are you actually listening to me?

887
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,343
I'm meeting him. End of story.

888
01:07:58,423 --> 01:08:01,446
Oh, great. Should I just remove
my pants now...

889
01:08:01,526 --> 01:08:04,282
...to make it easier for him
when he comes up here to fuck me?

890
01:08:04,362 --> 01:08:07,295
I'm not going to give him my key card.

891
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,153
Well, he has got leverage against you.

892
01:08:09,233 --> 01:08:12,901
The idiot let me decide on the meeting spot.

893
01:08:17,342 --> 01:08:19,414
Where's your piece, Colton?

894
01:08:51,742 --> 01:08:54,632
- All right. She's clean.
- Who is she?

895
01:08:54,712 --> 01:08:56,668
She's one of the mortgage
accounts that you...

896
01:08:56,748 --> 01:09:00,304
I'm Melanie Cross.
I live at 22nd and Pacific.

897
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,320
Not for long.

898
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,946
Just...

899
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:08,391
Key card.

900
01:09:08,471 --> 01:09:09,810
Files.

901
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:22,175
Are you...

902
01:09:22,464 --> 01:09:25,096
- ...looking for this?
- Okay.

903
01:09:25,893 --> 01:09:27,231
Just a little pro tip.

904
01:09:27,311 --> 01:09:31,877
Employees' IQs at this firm are inversely
proportionate to their salaries, so...

905
01:09:31,957 --> 01:09:36,228
...it's probably not a good idea to try to
outsmart someone with a smaller paycheck.

906
01:09:37,388 --> 01:09:39,280
Key card.

907
01:09:47,164 --> 01:09:50,311
Now give me the hard drive. I've done my bit.

908
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:51,673
Not yet.

909
01:09:53,371 --> 01:09:55,460
Gotta sign this first.

910
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:04,697
I could sign this, sure...

911
01:10:04,777 --> 01:10:08,339
...then claim temporary insanity
and have it dismissed.

912
01:10:08,419 --> 01:10:10,141
Sorry, sweetie...

913
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,681
...but you can always take it
to the man upstairs...

914
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:16,541
...with that card you've got if you like.

915
01:10:26,037 --> 01:10:27,875
You fucking whore!

916
01:10:27,955 --> 01:10:31,048
- Give us a minute.
- Yeah, totally.

917
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:28,166
Bullets are for cowards.

918
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:30,315
Oh, shit.

919
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:41,899
No, no, wait!

920
01:11:41,979 --> 01:11:45,039
That card doesn't work.
It needs an access code.

921
01:12:14,313 --> 01:12:16,735
I got it. No.

922
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:20,805
No! No, no! No!

923
01:12:21,235 --> 01:12:23,261
I'm gonna burn your eyes out.

924
01:13:08,099 --> 01:13:10,789
I am done fucking around.

925
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:13,057
Give us the code right now.

926
01:13:13,237 --> 01:13:17,095
I'll give you the code,
but here's the new deal, boy.

927
01:13:17,175 --> 01:13:18,630
- You give me her.
- What?

928
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:22,600
She destroyed my work. That's years of my
life. You want your revenge? Give me mine.

929
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,770
I just want my home back, you asshole!

930
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,540
The quarantine is ending soon.

931
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,326
- Your time is running out.
- Give me the access code!

932
01:13:32,656 --> 01:13:34,612
I'll give you a pro tip.

933
01:13:34,692 --> 01:13:36,748
You want to swim to the top?

934
01:13:36,828 --> 01:13:38,716
Drop the dead weight.

935
01:13:39,196 --> 01:13:41,055
She'll do it.

936
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,723
Five!

937
01:13:45,803 --> 01:13:47,361
Four!

938
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,365
Three.

939
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:57,335
- Two!
- One.

940
01:13:58,315 --> 01:13:59,857
Deal.

941
01:14:02,019 --> 01:14:04,896
Fuck you, Derek, you piece-of-shit suit!

942
01:14:05,456 --> 01:14:08,345
You're just like all of them!
You belong here!

943
01:14:09,085 --> 01:14:10,615
Fuck!

944
01:14:11,095 --> 01:14:12,560
Done?

945
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:18,289
Fuck you! Fuck you.

946
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:20,827
I'll be back shortly, sweetie.

947
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:23,038
Come on.

948
01:14:52,169 --> 01:14:54,192
These things only work once.

949
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:56,730
Don't do anything stupid.

950
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:38,487
<i>Can you see it, Derek?</i>

951
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:43,146
<i>Can you see the solution to our problem here?</i>

952
01:15:47,425 --> 01:15:50,268
<i>You're infected. You have impunity!</i>

953
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:54,642
<i>Nevil Reed, he got away with murder.
Maybe I can have a little fun here.</i>

954
01:15:57,301 --> 01:15:59,327
<i>Well, I'm gonna beat you to the punch.</i>

955
01:16:06,377 --> 01:16:08,082
<i>Let's discuss.</i>

956
01:16:37,007 --> 01:16:39,786
- What's that?
- The terms of my surrender...

957
01:16:39,866 --> 01:16:41,668
...partnership contract.

958
01:16:45,883 --> 01:16:48,539
You're a fucking piece of shit.

959
01:16:48,619 --> 01:16:52,393
Look, my guy killed your guy.
You killed my guy, so we're even.

960
01:16:52,473 --> 01:16:54,778
Let's just get down to business now?

961
01:16:54,858 --> 01:16:56,399
Ladies.

962
01:16:57,678 --> 01:17:01,121
Monthly profit participation,
annual performance bonus...

963
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:06,624
...vehicle allowances, gas,
maintenance, insurance, chauffeur.

964
01:17:06,704 --> 01:17:10,795
Expense accounts, full cellphone allowances...

965
01:17:10,925 --> 01:17:13,894
...paid parking, country-club fees.

966
01:17:13,974 --> 01:17:16,407
I've seen you admiring all of this, Derek.

967
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:21,210
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

968
01:17:21,635 --> 01:17:22,723
Yes.

969
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:26,247
Then why don't I see
a fucking pen in your hand?

970
01:17:27,474 --> 01:17:31,618
Do you really wanna spend the next 20
years of your life working your ass off...

971
01:17:31,698 --> 01:17:35,003
...for what, maybe half
of what I just offered you?

972
01:17:35,483 --> 01:17:37,505
Sign it, Derek.

973
01:17:37,985 --> 01:17:40,291
Sign it, and I'll suck your cock.

974
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:42,309
Sign it, and I'll help.

975
01:17:42,389 --> 01:17:45,416
- Be smart.
- Be rich.

976
01:17:58,572 --> 01:18:00,130
No.

977
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:33,144
Mine's bigger.

978
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,799
Mine's always bigger.

979
01:18:45,102 --> 01:18:46,774
You fucker.

980
01:18:53,926 --> 01:18:56,170
That's your problem, Derek. No vision.

981
01:19:04,672 --> 01:19:06,497
Fuck you.

982
01:19:13,397 --> 01:19:15,299
Fuck! Iron!

983
01:19:18,985 --> 01:19:21,711
No, not the 9, the 5!

984
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:42,396
Look at your partners.

985
01:19:42,476 --> 01:19:44,566
Look at your partners!

986
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:47,384
You know what they're thinking right now?

987
01:19:47,464 --> 01:19:52,172
They're thinking how big their piece of the
pie is gonna get once you stop taking yours.

988
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:55,676
This is where we vote, right?

989
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:58,883
Well, then let's vote. Make it quick.

990
01:20:14,175 --> 01:20:16,048
Can you do it, Derek?

991
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,699
Can you do it?

992
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:22,041
No, because you're too much of a pussy,
which is why I'm up here...

993
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:24,338
...and you are down there.

994
01:20:24,418 --> 01:20:26,773
But when this is all over...

995
01:20:26,853 --> 01:20:29,679
...I will piss on your corpse, as well.

996
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:59,000
<i>And so the king falls.</i>

997
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,843
<i>With the quarantine about to lift,
I finally gotta plead my case to The Nine...</i>

998
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:06,948
<i>...excuse me, Eight...
and have my own day in court.</i>

999
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:11,468
<i>Surprisingly, given the fact that I just
threw their former CEO off a balcony...</i>

1000
01:21:11,548 --> 01:21:13,805
<i>...they seemed pretty willing to listen.</i>

1001
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:18,525
<i>In a calm and collected manner,
I explained to them my situation...</i>

1002
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:21,528
<i>...my dedication to the firm,
the abuse of company resources...</i>

1003
01:21:21,608 --> 01:21:23,764
<i>...by those above my pay grade, yada yada.</i>

1004
01:21:23,844 --> 01:21:25,999
<i>I don't need to bore you
with the long-form version.</i>

1005
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:29,370
<i>With a sound defense and in light
of the day's events, I pled that...</i>

1006
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,822
I think I deserve my job back.

1007
01:21:33,404 --> 01:21:36,197
<i>But as they voted, it dawned on me...</i>

1008
01:21:36,277 --> 01:21:39,363
<i>...something my sister had been
trying to tell me for years...</i>

1009
01:21:39,443 --> 01:21:42,206
<i>...what my new friend reminded me today.</i>

1010
01:21:42,996 --> 01:21:44,956
<i>I didn't have a job.</i>

1011
01:21:45,036 --> 01:21:46,816
<i>The job had me.</i>

1012
01:21:46,896 --> 01:21:49,791
<i>I was just another
fucking slave to the grind.</i>

1013
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:54,528
<i>Look, we paint our paths
with the best of intentions...</i>

1014
01:21:54,608 --> 01:21:58,386
<i>...but at the end of the day, sometimes
it takes a brushstroke of circumstance...</i>

1015
01:21:59,596 --> 01:22:03,640
<i>...or a deadly virus to set us
on the right path again.</i>

1016
01:22:07,975 --> 01:22:10,644
<i>And the incident at TSC,
as they're calling it...</i>

1017
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:13,814
<i>...ended up being a watershed case
to finally accelerate a vaccine...</i>

1018
01:22:13,894 --> 01:22:16,347
<i>...to prevent the symptoms
of the ID-7 virus...</i>

1019
01:22:16,427 --> 01:22:19,153
<i>...pending FDA approval, of course.</i>

1020
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,989
<i>You're welcome. And for the firm itself...</i>

1021
01:22:22,069 --> 01:22:25,359
<i>...well, they did what any corporate
asshole in a corner would do.</i>

1022
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:27,995
<i>They offered me Towers' job.</i>

1023
01:22:28,075 --> 01:22:30,951
<i>Finally a seat at the big kids' table.</i>

1024
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:53,956
<i>So I took the gig...</i>

1025
01:22:55,536 --> 01:22:59,563
<i>...just long enough to make an executive
decision and do some good in the world.</i>

1026
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:10,968
I quit.

1027
01:23:11,218 --> 01:23:12,653
<i>Now, I know what you're thinking.</i>

1028
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:14,775
<i>We wrapped this story up
in a nice little bow...</i>

1029
01:23:14,855 --> 01:23:19,053
<i>...and we pretty much just killed
a bunch of people. I live with that.</i>

1030
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:22,499
<i>But they do say everything
happens for a reason.</i>

1031
01:23:22,579 --> 01:23:24,618
<i>I'm starting to believe it.</i>

1032
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:28,512
<i>Here's one more pro tip.
Paint your own path to success...</i>

1033
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:30,955
<i>...in work, love, and life...</i>

1034
01:23:33,957 --> 01:23:36,287
<i>...before it's too fucking late.</i>
