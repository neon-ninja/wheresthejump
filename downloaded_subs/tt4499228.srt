2
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:05,864
Mommy?

3
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,951
Jack!

4
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,578
Jack!

5
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,334
Jack!

6
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,379
Where are you!

7
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,391
Over there is fine.

8
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,017
Ruth? It's Paulina.

9
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,271
Patch me through to Morgan.

10
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,733
Paulina, how was your flight?

11
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,569
Long.

12
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,194
Did you get the
email I sent you?

13
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,738
Great location, lots
of red tape, though.

14
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,490
I can get us through it.

15
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,992
I'm sure you can.

16
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,577
But Thomas won't go for
anything, unless he knows

17
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,747
exactly what he's getting into.

18
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,082
I'll get him the specs on
every inch of this place.

19
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,043
Try to enjoy yourself,
it's a tropical island

20
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,418
for God's sake.

21
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,255
I'll relax when
I have your office.

22
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,257
Slow down.

23
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,925
I might have another
year left in me.

24
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,385
Did you put in a
good word for me?

25
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,596
Every chance I get.

26
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,264
You know, take care of
yourself, and keep me posted.

27
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,269
Okay, Morgan. See you.

28
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,445
Welcome to Resort
Saipan, my name is Tony.

29
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,865
And here are your Bojobo dolls,

30
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:35,204
This, a gift from the
natives of Saipan.

31
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,125
Depending how you place them.

32
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,211
Different wish.

33
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,963
This is for children.

34
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,430
Gracias, that will be all.

35
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,430
Adios.

36
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:57,601
Enjoy your stay in Saipan.

37
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,123
Coffee?

38
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,291
Yes. Please.

39
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,336
Coffee. Cream,
no sugar, to go.

40
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,506
Good memory.

41
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,966
Any sign of Dave?

42
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,511
Yeah. He's out shooting
the cargo ships coming in.

43
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,680
Hey, did your brother get
back to you this morning?

44
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,390
Yeah. He did.

45
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,642
Thanks for asking.

46
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,685
I'm sure it's all
going to work out.

47
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,603
Everything will be alright.

48
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:46,775
We all got to grow
up sometime, right?

49
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,281
That's Alan.

50
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,201
Paulina.

51
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,747
Hi.

52
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,749
Hey, Alan, this is
my associate, Tyler.

53
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,584
He's my architectural
consultant.

54
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,627
Tyler!

55
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,130
Great to meet you.

56
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:19,183
Well, I'll go, find Dave.

57
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,063
- So How are...
- You want some coffee?

58
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,399
Sorry.

59
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,374
No, I'm fine.

60
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:43,998
Dave!

61
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,958
Hey.

62
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,045
Long time no see.

63
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,963
Paulina. Great to see you.

64
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,256
It's good to see you.

65
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,424
How's island life
been treating you?

66
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,927
Amazing as ever.

67
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,012
Hey Tyler.

68
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,513
I picked up this shirt in Tokyo.

69
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,933
What does it say?

70
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,983
"I am America's
number one pervert."

71
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,986
Son of a bitch.

72
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,280
The sales person said it
was a very funny shirt.

73
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,739
It is.

74
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:19,408
Impressive at
reading Japanese,

75
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,368
can't be an easy
language to master.

76
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,954
My pronunciation's for
shit but I can stumble

77
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,664
through a conversation.

78
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,498
Me, I prefer to
speak dollars and cents.

79
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,126
The language the whole
world understands.

80
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,084
You know what I mean?

81
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,752
Shall we?

82
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:32,463
Hey, what are they
protesting about?

83
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,464
Yeah, the property we
are headed to, actually.

84
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,800
Shouldn't worry.

85
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,802
Natives never go
anywhere in there.

86
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,179
Wait 'till you see this place.

87
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,180
It's beautiful.

88
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,350
It's 20 acre that you got.

89
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,233
Pepe, what the hell is this?

90
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,903
You don't like it?

91
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,321
All good vans taken.

92
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,785
Plus, you always say
to save money, boss.

93
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,996
My cousin give us good deal.

94
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,830
Just help them with their stuff.

95
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,373
Okay, okay. Got it.

96
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,293
Um, it's,

97
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,837
Yeah. It's good.

98
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,006
Thanks.

99
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,345
Seems odd that the locals
are protesting the sale

100
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,637
but they never go there.

101
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,182
During World War II, some
of the natives went missing,

102
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,685
probably worked to
death by the Japanese.

103
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,186
My guess is that they
want to put a memorial up.

104
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,229
So if we obtain the land,

105
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,523
we'll just make it part
of our construction.

106
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,901
Whoa. Somebody's been
doing their homework, huh?

107
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,614
It was sacred burial ground,
before Japanese even come.

108
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:45,453
From early Spanish colonies,
they bring disease and bad men.

109
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,747
A lot of our people died.

110
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,248
But the point is.

111
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,459
It's that the Japanese is the
one who desecrated the land,

112
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,630
but now it's just a
prime real estate.

113
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,884
Pepe is right.

114
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,886
There's a lot of
folklore dating back

115
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,262
to the Spanish colonization.

116
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,348
Nobody cares about the
Spanish or the locals,

117
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,932
it's the World War II aspect

118
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,893
that the history
buffs are after.

119
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,478
There's tours given
on the island already,

120
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,815
but you guys can run your
own from the new resort.

121
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,985
I'm more interested
in the folklore.

122
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,552
If it's a burial ground,

123
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,680
shouldn't the natives be
visiting out of respect?

124
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,098
Not normal ground.

125
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,932
They think it is cursed place.

126
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,102
Superstitious son of bitches.

127
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,521
Witch doctors give
Saipan bad name.

128
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,105
We're modern people now.

129
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,400
Like Americans and Japanese.

130
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,359
This place sounds wonderful.

131
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,778
It's going to make it
difficult to hire local staff.

132
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,198
You offer them a couple bucks

133
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,783
and you watch superstition
fly out the window.

134
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,618
Money trumps fear every time.

135
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,204
Worked on me, boss.

136
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,625
See? Nothing to worry about.

137
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,977
Christ's sake, Pepe.

138
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,031
I got a set of
these in my room,

139
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,658
but they were way
nicer than this.

140
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,994
Bojobo dolls. Local
good-luck charms.

141
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,039
Not always.

142
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,666
The way they're tied
signifies the wish.

143
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,670
Hey, what do these mean?

144
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,675
That we should keep out.

145
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,013
Back inside.

146
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,017
It's a little further up.

147
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,370
Pepe!

148
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,099
Now that's a view.

149
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,602
Did I deliver or what?

150
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,605
It's nice.

151
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,189
But there's a lot of trees
that will need clearing.

152
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,192
Are there utilities
routed out this far?

153
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,233
Just 2 miles up the road.

154
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,153
Really.

155
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,905
Paulina, the beauty of this
place is how untouched it is.

156
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:14,244
Which makes it an
expensive development.

157
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,247
I see.

158
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,792
Morgan has taught you well.

159
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,881
There's a lovely cove down
the way with a waterfall.

160
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,759
Hey Dave, Alan's going
to show you a waterfall.

161
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,594
Grab whatever else you can get.

162
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,555
Tyler and I are going
to scout the beach.

163
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,060
Meet us down there in an hour.

164
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,608
I'm thinking two infinity pools

165
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,401
facing this side with
a V shaped structure

166
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,655
in order to maximize
balconies with this view.

167
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,114
Or you could work
with the landscape.

168
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,910
Consider three
tiers of Bungalows.

169
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,790
Jungle, beach, over-water.

170
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,915
Push the romance factor.

171
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,876
Sell it as an exclusive to
honeymooners and couples.

172
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,460
Cuts down on clearing costs.

173
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:08,299
And you can push the eco-friendly
factor to the locals.

174
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,967
I like it.

175
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,057
But don't give Alan an inch
if we want a good price.

176
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,812
So how long have
you known Alan?

177
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,605
Not long.

178
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,824
Amazing.

179
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,700
I haven't seen this
species before.

180
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,494
Do either of you
know what it is?

181
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,500
Yeah, that's
Pervertis Americans.

182
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,426
What is that thing?

183
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,094
Hydro-sole-atomizer.

184
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,345
Very good for the skin.

185
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,848
It has aromatic qualities,

186
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,810
Yeah, forget I asked.

187
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,193
So, you found
my favorite spot!

188
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,450
What do you think?

189
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,701
This place has potential.

190
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,202
Alright.

191
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,247
But being so remote, it
would complicate construction.

192
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,539
A lot.

193
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,874
What are you
guys talking about?

194
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,709
This place is dying
to be a 5 star resort.

195
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,755
Dave has the photographer's
eyes, he sees it.

196
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:32,174
Speaking of which, Dave,
can we get some aerial?

197
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,135
Thought you'd never ask.

198
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,014
This here is the X8-M drone.

199
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,642
State of the art
and ready to fly.

200
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,815
We'll have footage of this entire
property in under an hour.

201
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,029
Don't touch it!

202
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,918
Wait, Dave, can you go
over the last section again?

203
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,419
Got it.

204
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,255
Zoom in.

205
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,762
I thought you said
no one comes here.

206
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,059
Well, whoever it is,
they're trespassing.

207
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,020
No, they look like they are
headed somewhere specific.

208
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,939
Probably to the bunker.

209
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,776
Bunker?

210
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,279
It's just an old machine
gun nest, it's nothing.

211
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,242
We'll need to see it.

212
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,561
They're Latte stones.

213
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,519
It's thought they were
pillars that the Chamarro

214
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,104
built their houses on.

215
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,232
That's what white man thinks.

216
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,403
These mark way to sulares,

217
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,949
sacred ground.

218
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,701
Really?

219
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,087
Very strong spirits,
place the Latte Stones.

220
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,132
When trespassers come
without permission,

221
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,010
they become very angry.

222
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,971
Best not to touch.

223
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,853
He's screwing with you.

224
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,978
Listen you can keep these
up for cultural value or

225
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,105
level the whole place.

226
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,359
I've always thought it would
make a great tennis court.

227
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,528
Buyer's choice, of course.

228
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,705
Hey this is private property.

229
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,792
Come on, out!

230
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,876
Pepe!

231
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,295
On it, boss.

232
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,353
Did he just say
you have a gun?

233
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,020
He's bluffing.

234
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,730
Ignorant bastards.

235
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,065
I knew you spoke Spanish but...

236
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,734
Chamorro uses
some Spanish words.

237
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,951
Come on.

238
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,543
What did he say?

239
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,335
Superstitious bullshit.

240
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,505
Like mi madre used to say.

241
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,804
How deep do you
think it goes down?

242
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,890
Could be 10 feet.

243
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,226
Could be a mile.

244
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,146
What was that?

245
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,814
It's nothing, Dave.

246
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,649
You know there's no real
reason to go down there, right?

247
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,818
Your people could just wall
up that entrance and be done.

248
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,490
What do you think?

249
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,949
If it runs under
the property it could

250
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:07,951
create a structural issue.

251
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,540
Better take a look.

252
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,669
Yup.

253
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,533
One more.

254
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,583
This will definitely
need a full survey.

255
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,756
But we're, not really
equipped for cave exploration.

256
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,257
Yeah, Tyler's got a
point there, you know.

257
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,092
Look, why don't we hire
a full excavation team

258
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,179
as soon as we're in escrow.

259
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,554
Thomas won't sign off
for an unknown property.

260
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,848
We need to what's down here.

261
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,436
It's your call.

262
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,564
Paulina.

263
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,482
Let's do it.

264
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:08,447
Dave, front and center, I
want all of this on video.

265
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,480
I thought you just said
it was a machine gun nest.

266
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,735
That's what I
was told, alright?

267
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,822
Did you never bother to check?

268
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,614
That looks solid.

269
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,992
I sure hope so.

270
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,135
Wow.

271
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,775
I'm surprised the Marines

272
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,362
didn't strip this
place for souvenirs.

273
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,612
Who's to say
they even found it?

274
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:35,701
This is nowhere near where
the Americans invaded.

275
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,832
Somebody didn't clean
up after themselves.

276
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:46,546
And looks like that
somebody was real hungry.

277
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,138
How far does this go?

278
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,849
Now, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

279
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:02,977
Alright.

280
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,604
Let's go for it.

281
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,523
Come on.

282
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,651
Paulina.

283
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,449
Coming, boss?

284
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,577
Uh, yeah.

285
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,663
Yeah.

286
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,700
That's a real dead body.

287
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,244
We can all see that, Dave.

288
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:05,291
I had no idea that there was
anything like this down here.

289
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,792
Listen, Pepe, will get
a full team

290
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,043
to take care of the remains.

291
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,461
I would hope so.

292
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,963
Paulina.

293
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,341
Paulina, hold on.

294
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,805
Dave, Dave.

295
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,308
Come on, let's go.

296
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,388
Dave, what is it?

297
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:08,268
How many dead
people are down here?

298
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,271
Paulina, I...

299
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,068
Oh my God.

300
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,863
What would a woman be doing
down here in war time?

301
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,615
She could've been
a prisoner, spy.

302
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:22,616
But she's wearing slacks.

303
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,867
Women in the 40s wore skirts.

304
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,244
Maybe her dress got ruined.

305
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,248
Does it really matter?

306
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:30,876
Pepe?

307
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,132
Thought I hear something.

308
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:38,884
A ghost?

309
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,052
A ghost?

310
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,053
Really?

311
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,054
Yeah.

312
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,096
Really.

313
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,139
You're an idiot.

314
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,143
And you're an asshole.

315
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:11,625
What the hell?

316
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:16,714
Hello?

317
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:33,605
Who is that?

318
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:40,904
Hey.

319
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,412
Get, out.

320
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,370
Out!

321
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,206
Before!

322
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:51,916
Door!

323
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,251
Let go of me!

324
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,338
Who the hell is that?

325
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,798
What the hell is that!

326
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,632
You killed him.

327
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,552
Shut up!

328
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:05,846
He's still breathing.

329
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,644
What are you trying to tell us?

330
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:14,770
Let me see your footage.

331
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:15,854
Let go.

332
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:16,939
- What are you doing!
- Delete the footage!

333
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:17,776
Alan!

334
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,987
You,

335
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:23,823
must,

336
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,700
die.

337
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,309
Your fault.

338
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,776
You all saw that, right?

339
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,068
I mean, that was
self defense, right?

340
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,362
You saw he ran at
me, attacked me!

341
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,072
Hell, Jesus Christ!

342
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:10,245
He's practically dead when we
got here, I mean, look at him!

343
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,996
How did he know your name?

344
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,248
How the hell should I know?

345
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,290
Maybe he locked him
down here years ago.

346
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,628
Don't be ridiculous, Dave.

347
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,462
Who are you calling?

348
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,883
Can you connect me to the
local police department?

349
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,884
Let go!

350
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,885
I need that footage,

351
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,886
Get off him!

352
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,889
Alan, get off!

353
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,732
Oh my god.

354
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,776
What the hell was that?

355
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,361
I don't know but we've
got to get out of here.

356
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,612
Tyler.

357
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:47,449
Listen.

358
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,624
Is everyone okay?

359
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,293
I think so.

360
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,880
I've been better.

361
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,884
Who turned on the lights?

362
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,095
What the hell was that?

363
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,389
Who cares?

364
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,682
Let's just get out of it
before it happens again.

365
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,517
Broke the damn light.

366
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,643
You're paying for this.

367
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,480
Shut up.

368
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,405
Old man is gone.

369
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,288
He wasn't even dead.

370
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,961
The others are gone, too

371
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,014
This isn't right.

372
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,018
What?

373
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:49,820
Come on.

374
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,571
We should get out of here.

375
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,572
But it's not,

376
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,032
You got to be kidding me!

377
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,995
Now what?

378
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,351
Son of a bitch!

379
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,267
It's no good, it won't budge.

380
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,894
What do you mean?

381
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,063
I mean it won't budge!

382
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,151
Help! Somebody
help us! Let us out!

383
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,737
We left that open, I swear.

384
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,655
We should never
have gotten in here.

385
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:37,494
Does anybody
else have a signal?

386
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:40,704
Dead.

387
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,831
You two pissed
off those natives

388
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,086
and they locked us in here!

389
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,838
We didn't do it!

390
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,757
We don't even know
these assholes!

391
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,425
Just let us out!

392
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,760
Dave, Dave. Calm down.

393
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,220
Calm down.

394
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,470
Alright?

395
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,472
Look.

396
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:00,682
It doesn't matter anymore.

397
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,101
We just need to find
another way out.

398
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,601
Yeah.

399
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,978
That should be right.

400
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,938
They wouldn't just
have one exit.

401
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,150
If the enemy blew it up
everyone would be trapped.

402
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,904
What is that sound?

403
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,451
God bless, God bless
Tyler, God bless Paulina,

404
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,704
It's me.

405
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,165
I'm praying.

406
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,458
I thought you said you
weren't superstitious.

407
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,836
Praying can't hurt, yeah?

408
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,795
Well it's annoying,
so knock it off!

409
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,005
I'm sorry, boss.

410
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,173
Dave's right.

411
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,845
There has to be another way out.

412
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,688
We should check in here again.

413
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,858
Maybe there's a back door.

414
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,242
This has to be
a different room.

415
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,287
But it looks identical.

416
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,290
Just like the...

417
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,960
This is definitely
the same room.

418
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,711
Same bed, same spot.

419
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:13,713
It's not possible.

420
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,173
Yes.

421
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,301
Not possible.

422
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,764
Maybe those native
people are messing with us.

423
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,349
They could've cleaned it all
up while we were knocked out.

424
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,474
That couldn't have been
more than five minutes

425
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:26,851
between the quake and the
lights coming back on.

426
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:27,726
There's no way.

427
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:28,811
Are you sure?

428
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,646
A clean-up like
this would take days.

429
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:31,938
It just doesn't add up.

430
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,525
Maybe we're on
a different level.

431
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:35,985
What do you mean?

432
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,487
Like, same floor
plan, different level.

433
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,697
We might be one floor down?

434
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:40,990
But why go through
all the trouble?

435
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:42,492
Jesus, who cares!

436
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:46,456
There's no another exit
in this room, so let's go!

437
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,168
He's got a point.

438
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,920
I'm going this way.

439
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,505
No, we should stick together.

440
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,550
Yeah, I'm done
following your lead.

441
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,217
Pepe.

442
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,802
Alan.

443
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,723
We'll cover more
ground this way.

444
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:09,561
Pepe!

445
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,358
Must be a way out
here somewhere!

446
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,196
I think there
isn't any way out.

447
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,615
Are you quitting on me?

448
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:25,617
You come here,
Taotaomo'nas are angry.

449
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,412
Taotaomo'nas? I thought
you were modern people, Pepe?

450
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:30,206
Modern people don't
know everything, yeah?

451
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,085
You show me that, boss.

452
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,713
What did you say?

453
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,677
Listen to me, Pepe.

454
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,804
If you think, I'm
going the wrong way,

455
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,597
then you feel free to run
back off to the others

456
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,935
and see where that gets you.

457
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:52,647
No, boss.

458
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,695
They are not going
the right way, either.

459
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:01,780
I tell you.

460
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,954
Nobody gets out.

461
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,500
Shut up, Pepe.

462
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:25,155
Jackpot.

463
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,079
Japanese, do you speak Japanese?

464
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:37,916
I can ask where toilet is.

465
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:38,920
You make that work.

466
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,422
Come on, Pepe.

467
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,809
Sorry, boss.

468
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,980
Nothing about toilet here.

469
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:01,900
Tyler.

470
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:23,211
I think this was lying there.

471
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:51,701
It's a diary.

472
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:55,621
See.

473
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,666
He says, my sins are too many.

474
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,419
They haunt my dreams.

475
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:05,128
I will make amends with my life.

476
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,299
Then the dreams will stop.

477
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:13,012
I guess he made them stop.

478
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:13,847
Guys?

479
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:16,975
Hey! Hey!

480
00:42:58,411 --> 00:42:59,911
Who the hell is that?

481
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:02,412
This guy just came in and
started waiving his gun around,

482
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,168
Shut. Up.

483
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,341
He could've shown us a way out.

484
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:13,093
He found a way.

485
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:16,011
Bullshit.

486
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:19,304
We found a radio but everything
is labeled in Japanese.

487
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:21,307
Take me there.

488
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:22,143
Come on.

489
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:37,574
No, boss.

490
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:41,286
Nobody gets out.

491
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:48,168
Here.

492
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:50,964
Okay.

493
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,301
Okay.

494
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:02,391
Damn it!

495
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,605
I got something.

496
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,441
It's Japanese.

497
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:13,653
Great. Just talk to them.

498
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,171
It's a recorded message.

499
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,630
Just keeps repeating.

500
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,176
What does it say?

501
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:40,346
It's an imperial order.

502
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:51,358
David... David.

503
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:02,532
Civilians who commit suicide
get equal spiritual status

504
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,744
to soldiers who die in battle.

505
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:07,374
Maybe, try another frequency.

506
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:15,965
Kill her, Tyler.

507
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:23,682
Wait, what is it?

508
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,559
It's, just static.

509
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:29,853
Great.

510
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,063
Isn't it, Paulina?

511
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:32,981
Just great!

512
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,074
Dave.. Dave,

513
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:49,079
I gave you first crack at
this property, as a favor!

514
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,664
I had 3 other buyers out there!

515
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,999
All ready to sign,
ready to bring in

516
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,166
their own the professional team!

517
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,418
Just like you should've done!

518
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,628
If they'd even
found out about it

519
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,795
before they started
the construction.

520
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:58,255
Maybe if you hadn't
lied about it.

521
00:45:58,257 --> 00:45:59,298
Listen!

522
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,590
Listen.

523
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,135
All these arguing isn't
doing anybody any good.

524
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:05,890
We still need to find
another way out, right?

525
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:12,271
Hey, Dave. Are you okay?

526
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:15,942
I'm fine.

527
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:18,945
Did we reach someone?

528
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:20,779
No.

529
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:13,641
Which way do we go?

530
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,894
Well, I'm going this way.

531
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,418
It's your lead.

532
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,509
I'll take it.

533
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:52,512
Hey guys, what about Pepe?

534
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:56,685
He's probably hiding in
some corner, so screw him.

535
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,615
Japanese didn't carve this.

536
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:11,576
Here.

537
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,255
Definitely not.

538
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,096
Smells awful.

539
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:49,655
More Latte stones?

540
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:55,870
I know what this place is.

541
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:03,668
I've read about it in a
book on Chamorro folklore.

542
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,920
This was a burial site
for ancient chiefs.

543
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:08,338
These were the
first Bojobo dolls.

544
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,175
And, they help the spirits of
ancient chief and his bride,

545
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,345
whose bond was eternal.

546
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:17,934
That's why all the
dolls come in pairs now.

547
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:22,854
By separating the two
a curse was formed.

548
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,313
His bride was kept above ground,

549
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:26,441
but the chief was
buried down here

550
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:28,358
with a Spanish commander
who did terrible things

551
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,030
to the Chamorro people during
the first colonization.

552
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:33,905
The Chief's suffering
for his lost love

553
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:36,117
would be equally eternal
and that torment,

554
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,702
would be felt by the commander,

555
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:42,914
who's supposed to be still
down here, and still alive.

556
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,458
Oh my god, that's
the biggest crock

557
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,376
of shit I've ever heard.

558
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:49,130
These people believed it
enough to paint it on the wall.

559
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:50,757
To ward off the foreigners.

560
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,215
There's probably treasure
buried down there

561
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:53,717
with ancient chief.

562
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,927
What about that crazy looking
old man that attacked you?

563
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:58,432
Oh, he looks Spanish to you?

564
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:04,271
Well did he?

565
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:07,356
What does that say?

566
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:09,943
It's asking for, forgiveness.

567
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:18,118
Release.

568
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:21,623
Escape.

569
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,085
David.

570
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:35,260
Claire?

571
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:39,599
And then it says kill me.

572
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:54,989
Oh my god, Dave!

573
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:58,784
Alan, take it.

574
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:01,284
I saw, I saw.

575
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:02,286
It's okay.

576
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:03,373
Relax, relax.

577
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:09,293
Dave, I think it's
dislocated. Alright?

578
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:10,795
It's alright, my brother
did the same thing

579
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:12,257
when we were kids.

580
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,800
Sorry, pal.

581
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,637
This is going to hurt.

582
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:24,307
We should get him
back to the barracks.

583
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:25,892
Yeah.

584
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:28,813
Dude we don't
have time for this.

585
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,735
We need to keep
searching for an exit.

586
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:36,070
Oh, come on, Paulina.

587
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:37,822
No one is stopping you, Alan.

588
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,322
Just uhh, don't
forget to come find us

589
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:41,160
if you find a way out.

590
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:44,580
Fine. We'll stick together.

591
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:50,711
Easy.

592
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:00,805
Watch your head.

593
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:18,865
I'll stay with him.
You guys go on.

594
00:53:23,702 --> 00:53:25,038
Alan is wrong.

595
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:27,248
The curse is real.

596
00:53:33,963 --> 00:53:35,465
You should rest.

597
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:43,347
Somebody there?

598
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,230
What is this place?

599
00:54:09,248 --> 00:54:12,251
We're not one
floor down, are we?

600
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:15,547
I saw these exact same
pictures in the room before.

601
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:18,255
It's the natives.

602
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:19,757
Okay? It must be.

603
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:20,925
Tyler, the natives are
just screwing with us.

604
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:24,972
Pepe?

605
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,641
Mother of God.

606
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:31,936
What have you done to yourself?

607
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:34,938
I am witness now.

608
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,108
There must always be a witness.

609
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,526
She told me.

610
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:40,612
Who told you?

611
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:44,826
Mi madre.

612
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:49,037
Someone must carry their pain.

613
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:51,621
You listen to me, Pepe.
Your mother is dead.

614
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:52,625
Only one, forever.

615
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:55,834
I've had enough of this shit.

616
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:57,463
No, no, no, Alan!

617
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,340
Taotaomo'nas protect me.

618
00:55:01,342 --> 00:55:02,844
Screw you, Pepe.

619
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:06,681
It's okay.

620
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:10,099
Easy, Pepe.

621
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:13,728
Take it easy.

622
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,900
It's best you heed to
warnings, of your ancestors.

623
00:56:13,706 --> 00:56:15,375
Claire.

624
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:34,394
I'm so sorry.

625
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:37,063
It was an accident.

626
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:06,759
You, murdered me!

627
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:16,809
Dave.

628
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:17,687
Dave.

629
00:57:18,771 --> 00:57:19,898
Stop it.

630
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:32,075
She was choking me.

631
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:34,954
Who?

632
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:43,797
My sister.

633
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:47,007
There was an accident.

634
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:54,473
You don't have to tell me.

635
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:57,476
You don't have to tell me.

636
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:10,447
In the end, do you think
we'll have to pay for our sins?

637
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:15,704
I hope not.

638
00:58:32,637 --> 00:58:36,557
The old native dropped
this outside the cave.

639
00:58:37,516 --> 00:58:39,059
This is the female.

640
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:43,440
The male is down here somewhere.

641
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,150
Maybe we can put the
two back together.

642
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:50,739
Then maybe we can get
the hell out of here.

643
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:57,077
It's more than just a folk tale.

644
00:59:04,376 --> 00:59:07,128
Because it is not
possible. That's why.

645
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,171
That order was
given in 1944 when

646
00:59:09,173 --> 00:59:11,548
the US Marines were
overtaking the island.

647
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,008
It's a tourist
gimmick by history nuts.

648
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,385
And I suppose that guy
that just blew his brains out

649
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:17,974
was a suicidal World
War 2 re-enactor, huh?

650
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:32,820
You're saying we are
not on a different floor.

651
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:34,990
We're in a different time.

652
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:39,242
Yeah, that's the only
thing that makes any sense.

653
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:42,204
That's the only
thing that makes sense?

654
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:43,331
Do you hear yourself?

655
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,414
Are you buying this?

656
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:46,583
No! This is not an option!

657
00:59:46,585 --> 00:59:48,168
Okay, listen to yourself!

658
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,170
This is insane!

659
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:50,757
None of it is real!

660
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:10,317
Paulina?

661
01:00:13,112 --> 01:00:14,778
Tyler?

662
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,532
Stop messing around!

663
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:24,871
You,

664
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:26,164
must,

665
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,543
die.

666
01:00:36,635 --> 01:00:37,677
Don't you forget
you're the one

667
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,972
who made us come down here.

668
01:00:47,688 --> 01:00:49,604
We are the only
sane ones left.

669
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:51,733
No, he's right.

670
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,943
Whatever is happening
to us is my fault.

671
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:56,195
Paulina.

672
01:00:56,197 --> 01:00:57,032
Come on.

673
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,990
You couldn't have known...

674
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:01,492
If it wasn't for me,
we'd be back at the hotel

675
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:04,662
having drinks talking about
what an asshole Alan is,

676
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:08,209
I'm the one who insisted
we come down here.

677
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:11,671
You're right.

678
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:16,342
Alan is a huge asshole.

679
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:20,010
You are completely
wrong about the rest,

680
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:22,848
but Alan is
definitely an asshole.

681
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,483
Dave gave me this.

682
01:01:34,485 --> 01:01:37,362
He said that the old
native dropped it outside.

683
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:38,862
It's the matching
female to the male doll

684
01:01:38,864 --> 01:01:41,157
that's supposed to be down here.

685
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:44,452
Huh. Sure looks like
the one in the painting.

686
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:46,996
He said if we re-unite
them then we may be able

687
01:01:46,998 --> 01:01:48,541
to get out of here.

688
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:53,168
Look, I just told everybody
that I think we traveled

689
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:58,173
back in time, so I'm willing
to try anything right now.

690
01:01:58,175 --> 01:01:59,009
Come on.

691
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:03,845
Maybe this will
give us some clues.

692
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:04,807
It's bullshit.

693
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:07,102
It's bullshit. Just the
natives are screwing with us.

694
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:11,231
It's the natives screwing,

695
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:13,900
That son of a bitch.

696
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:23,574
Enough of this
voodoo crap, Pepe.

697
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:26,411
You come and face me like a man.

698
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:27,787
Hey, I'm talking to you!

699
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:28,623
Hey!

700
01:02:35,295 --> 01:02:36,295
Pepe!

701
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:37,295
Pepe!

702
01:02:37,297 --> 01:02:38,632
Pepe, come back!

703
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:41,927
Listen, I just want to talk!

704
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:51,146
Pepe, listen.

705
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,104
This is okay.

706
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,354
I get it, okay.

707
01:02:54,356 --> 01:02:57,025
You're one of the
protesters, right?

708
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,526
That's it. You've been working
with them from the start.

709
01:02:59,528 --> 01:03:01,237
You want to scare
all the white devils

710
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:02,530
away from your sacred ground.

711
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:04,659
It's genius.

712
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:09,122
Come on, Pepe!

713
01:03:18,172 --> 01:03:19,963
Show us our way out of here.

714
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:21,840
Tell the police
whatever you want.

715
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:23,217
You hear me, Pepe?

716
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:26,472
Get us out of here
and all is forgiven!

717
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,644
You want money?

718
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,150
Just get me out of here, Pepe.

719
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:40,901
I'm going to pay
whatever you want.

720
01:03:40,903 --> 01:03:42,153
You hear me?

721
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,490
Name your price!

722
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:45,784
Pepe!

723
01:03:58,838 --> 01:03:59,839
Her fault.

724
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:23,697
I'm going to go check on Dave.

725
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:25,592
Who's down there?

726
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:28,677
Mommy?

727
01:05:34,976 --> 01:05:36,978
Yes, sweetie, it's me.

728
01:05:38,188 --> 01:05:39,105
I'm cold.

729
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:46,526
I'm so sorry, Jack.

730
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:48,737
I should've been watching you.

731
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:50,115
Where were you?

732
01:05:51,576 --> 01:05:52,575
I'm right here now.

733
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:54,162
Mommy's right here.

734
01:06:13,264 --> 01:06:14,307
I missed you.

735
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:20,980
Did you forget about me?

736
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:23,316
Of course not.

737
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:26,568
I love you.

738
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:37,496
Why did you let me die?

739
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,084
Paulina!

740
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,512
What's the matter?

741
01:06:59,018 --> 01:07:01,101
My son, I saw my son.

742
01:07:01,103 --> 01:07:02,021
Hey. Hey.

743
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,111
Whatever you saw.

744
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:12,530
Whatever you saw,
it wasn't real.

745
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:13,408
Okay?

746
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:19,497
I didn't know you had a son.

747
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:25,045
I lost him 6 years ago.

748
01:07:29,757 --> 01:07:31,507
I'm so sorry.

749
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:32,427
He was 6.

750
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:36,804
And we were at the pier.

751
01:07:36,806 --> 01:07:38,389
I was with this
guy I was dating,

752
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:41,186
and I got distracted.

753
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:47,648
I took my eyes off him
for just one minute,

754
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,402
and then he was gone.

755
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:55,907
The next morning his
body washed up on shore.

756
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,827
He must have fallen in.

757
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:06,166
That's why I can't
be with anyone.

758
01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:08,170
Can you understand that?

759
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:19,264
Well, well, well.

760
01:08:20,307 --> 01:08:22,060
What do we have here?

761
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:26,564
Little inner-tunnel
romance, huh?

762
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:34,029
That's why you've been
so standoffish, Paulina.

763
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:37,699
You should've just told me.

764
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:39,202
It doesn't matter.

765
01:08:41,954 --> 01:08:45,125
I know he's going
to be one lucky guy.

766
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,334
What did you just say?

767
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:50,338
She moaned like a
whore when I railed her.

768
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:57,178
Don't you ever talk
about her like that again.

769
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,845
What's going on, Tyler?

770
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:02,682
I will rip your God Damned
throat out for saying that.

771
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:03,683
Tyler!

772
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:04,808
I didn't say anything.

773
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,186
He didn't say anything.

774
01:09:07,188 --> 01:09:09,524
He said that you, and him.

775
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,157
Easy.

776
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:29,502
I'm, I'm sorry.

777
01:09:30,502 --> 01:09:32,671
You were hearing things.

778
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:39,346
The same thing happened
to the soldiers here.

779
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,182
It's in the diary.

780
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:47,854
Sure.

781
01:09:57,238 --> 01:09:59,112
The officer and his
men were stationed here

782
01:09:59,114 --> 01:10:00,783
during World War II.

783
01:10:04,537 --> 01:10:08,708
The soldier named Kato
started behaving irrationally.

784
01:11:38,547 --> 01:11:40,050
The male Bojobo.

785
01:11:40,966 --> 01:11:43,800
Enough with the stupid dolls.

786
01:11:43,802 --> 01:11:45,385
Doesn't this look just
like the female doll

787
01:11:45,387 --> 01:11:46,803
from the painting?

788
01:11:46,805 --> 01:11:50,976
The old native dropped it
outside and Dave brought it in.

789
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,608
Kato continues to
be insubordinate.

790
01:12:20,422 --> 01:12:23,259
They found a
passage to Gehenna.

791
01:12:25,011 --> 01:12:28,014
The room where the
curse originated.

792
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:30,907
The battle of
Saipan had begun.

793
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:32,951
What did the creature say?

794
01:13:32,953 --> 01:13:36,123
He just wrote it
down phonetically.

795
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,677
That's Spanish.

796
01:13:49,636 --> 01:13:51,221
Only one can live.

797
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,687
The Japanese were
ordered to hold the island

798
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:01,274
until the very end.

799
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:03,941
So they did.

800
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:04,778
Ah, but...

801
01:15:11,552 --> 01:15:14,387
I am the only sane one left.

802
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:16,224
I know what I must do.

803
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:36,243
What?

804
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:38,163
It is done.

805
01:15:41,957 --> 01:15:46,126
Well, that was a lot
of help, wasn't it?

806
01:15:46,128 --> 01:15:47,461
Listen to me.

807
01:15:47,463 --> 01:15:49,339
Pepe's gone off the deep end.

808
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:52,215
He destroyed the radio,
and he's cut himself.

809
01:15:52,217 --> 01:15:54,220
Which one of us is next?

810
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:01,392
Well, you two can sit
here and think about it.

811
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:03,268
And I'm going to go do
what has to be done.

812
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,438
I'll find him.

813
01:16:08,609 --> 01:16:11,777
You don't think
Pepe would murder us?

814
01:16:11,779 --> 01:16:13,030
I don't know.

815
01:16:14,365 --> 01:16:16,491
But the last thing soldier said

816
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:19,494
was that he would make
amends with his life.

817
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:21,331
So, he killed himself.

818
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:34,094
Look at this.

819
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:41,057
Seems my life is
not amends enough.

820
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:44,436
How long must I live
in this hell, alone?

821
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:56,074
We need to find that room.

822
01:17:02,788 --> 01:17:04,123
David.

823
01:17:14,884 --> 01:17:15,801
No.

824
01:17:16,176 --> 01:17:17,094
No.

825
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,813
Oh my God, Dave.

826
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,823
Oh, this can't be happening.

827
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:41,077
It was recording.

828
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:50,125
Claire!

829
01:17:50,127 --> 01:17:51,126
Please!

830
01:17:51,128 --> 01:17:52,336
No!

831
01:17:52,338 --> 01:17:53,547
Who's Claire?

832
01:17:54,798 --> 01:17:56,301
His dead sister.

833
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,148
Wait, Pepe.

834
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:14,194
Pepe had a knife.

835
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:23,787
And Alan was right.

836
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,875
The generator must be dying.

837
01:18:30,877 --> 01:18:31,711
Come on.

838
01:18:34,213 --> 01:18:36,382
Come on, we have to hurry.

839
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,141
Stay behind me.

840
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,882
Let me see the camera.

841
01:20:08,807 --> 01:20:09,809
It's alright.

842
01:20:22,654 --> 01:20:23,696
I think someone is there.

843
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:24,574
Where?

844
01:20:26,784 --> 01:20:27,659
Where?

845
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:30,413
I can't see anything.

846
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:33,083
It's a woman.

847
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:36,168
Where?

848
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,172
I don't know, Turn
that off, I can't see.

849
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:44,342
She, she's coming at us!

850
01:20:44,344 --> 01:20:45,884
I can't see anything!

851
01:20:45,886 --> 01:20:46,845
Turn off!

852
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:52,519
No.

853
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:55,480
No. No!

854
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:00,107
Hey! Hey! Look at me!

855
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:01,108
Look at me.

856
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,317
It's not real.

857
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:03,945
It's not real.

858
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:05,278
It's not real.

859
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,488
There's nothing here.

860
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:07,324
See?

861
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:10,867
Alright?

862
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:11,829
I saw her.

863
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:20,213
It's okay.

864
01:21:22,381 --> 01:21:23,880
Okay.

865
01:21:23,882 --> 01:21:26,885
We're getting out
of here, together.

866
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:31,117
Oh god.

867
01:22:34,537 --> 01:22:35,538
That's it.

868
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:57,018
Great.

869
01:23:05,318 --> 01:23:06,401
Mommy!

870
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:07,404
It's okay.

871
01:23:08,863 --> 01:23:09,698
It's okay.

872
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:11,657
It's okay.

873
01:23:18,497 --> 01:23:20,332
Did you see him again?

874
01:23:23,502 --> 01:23:24,336
Hey. Hey.

875
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,964
Like you said, none
of this is real.

876
01:23:28,966 --> 01:23:29,800
Okay?

877
01:23:38,309 --> 01:23:39,144
Let me.

878
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:13,345
Smells even worse down here.

879
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:17,472
Oh, thank god, I found you.

880
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:18,930
Alan.

881
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:20,100
Dave's dead.

882
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:23,021
We think it was Pepe.

883
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:28,816
No.

884
01:24:28,818 --> 01:24:30,235
That would be me.

885
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:36,491
Tyler!

886
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:38,742
Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Wake up.

887
01:24:38,744 --> 01:24:41,163
Come on. Talk to me. Wake up!

888
01:24:43,082 --> 01:24:44,581
Why?

889
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:46,166
Why?

890
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:47,543
You think I'm going to
wait 'til this place

891
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:51,589
makes you all crazy
and you chop me up?

892
01:24:51,591 --> 01:24:53,259
No, no, no, Paulina.

893
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:57,678
I'm going to strike first.

894
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,013
Come here!

895
01:24:59,015 --> 01:24:59,849
Come back!

896
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:04,727
Paulina! Where are you going!

897
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:06,564
You can't run from me!

898
01:25:11,694 --> 01:25:12,695
You're dead!

899
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,905
You' hear me? dead!

900
01:26:05,164 --> 01:26:06,166
The curse.

901
01:26:17,092 --> 01:26:18,677
Only one, can live?

902
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,311
Torment to all.

903
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:33,485
Witness for eternity.

904
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:39,365
Torment for eternity.

905
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:41,785
Now you understand.

906
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:47,207
Spanish men come here,
to enslave our people.

907
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,335
So, shaman enslave him.

908
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,340
He kept him here.

909
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:57,714
Alone.

910
01:26:57,716 --> 01:26:59,259
For over 300 years.

911
01:27:19,613 --> 01:27:21,321
Where did you find her?

912
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:24,909
The old native dropped it
outside, and Dave picked it up.

913
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:27,202
He should not have done that!

914
01:27:27,204 --> 01:27:28,370
This can all end now.

915
01:27:28,372 --> 01:27:31,499
We can end the
curse, and be free.

916
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:33,459
That is not what
my ancestors want!

917
01:27:33,461 --> 01:27:35,085
But it's got
nothing to do with us.

918
01:27:35,087 --> 01:27:36,420
We weren't even born yet.

919
01:27:36,422 --> 01:27:37,588
You aren't born yet, even now.

920
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:40,176
Time matters not in this place.

921
01:27:41,802 --> 01:27:45,222
We slide back, so
Bojobo can be together.

922
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:48,726
Yes, so they can be together.

923
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:53,189
They want to be together.

924
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:29,641
All can be freed.

925
01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:35,562
Don't you worry, sweetheart.

926
01:28:35,564 --> 01:28:36,982
You'll get yours.

927
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,201
- No forgiveness!
- Don't!

928
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:55,835
We had a chance!

929
01:28:57,295 --> 01:28:58,503
Just me.

930
01:28:58,505 --> 01:28:59,838
Stay down, Pepe!

931
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:09,932
I am Gai Taotao!

932
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:13,435
The spirits protect me!

933
01:30:25,216 --> 01:30:29,137
Only one, only one,

934
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:42,358
You win, boss.

935
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:48,448
But you not understand.

936
01:30:49,114 --> 01:30:53,619
One witness forever.

937
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,640
Chosen one, my ass.

938
01:31:17,644 --> 01:31:19,771
Just you and me, Paulina.

939
01:31:35,453 --> 01:31:38,331
Give it up, Paulina!

940
01:32:14,367 --> 01:32:16,453
I'm the one who survives.

941
01:32:55,449 --> 01:32:57,743
Paulina!

942
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:01,872
Paulina!

943
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:07,585
Come out come out
wherever you are, Paulina.

944
01:33:07,587 --> 01:33:09,255
I got you.

945
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:17,180
Take it easy, okay?

946
01:33:20,557 --> 01:33:22,724
I should shoot
you down right now.

947
01:33:22,726 --> 01:33:23,560
Paulina!

948
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:30,192
Don't.

949
01:33:34,113 --> 01:33:35,114
Don't do it.

950
01:33:36,282 --> 01:33:38,534
You should listen to him.

951
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:41,035
Listen to him.

952
01:33:41,037 --> 01:33:43,161
We had a chance.

953
01:33:43,163 --> 01:33:44,498
We had a chance.

954
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:57,971
You, bitch!

955
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:00,764
Wait!

956
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,403
Only one can live.

957
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:11,377
I'm so sorry.

958
01:35:45,744 --> 01:35:48,161
I love you.

959
01:35:48,163 --> 01:35:49,666
I love you, too.

960
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:54,710
What are you waiting for?

961
01:35:54,712 --> 01:35:56,130
Get on with that!

962
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:31,496
Just me and you, Tyler.

963
01:36:31,498 --> 01:36:33,499
How did I get in here?

964
01:36:33,501 --> 01:36:34,836
Tyler, I didn't.

965
01:36:43,636 --> 01:36:45,680
Bravo.

966
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:48,475
You win.

967
01:36:50,393 --> 01:36:54,646
You, you still
don't get it, do you?

968
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:03,114
You, selfish piece of shit.

969
01:37:07,577 --> 01:37:14,125
If you live, you lose.

970
01:37:19,713 --> 01:37:21,757
You lose worst of all.

971
01:37:31,266 --> 01:37:36,563
After all, doesn't
this all look familiar?

972
01:37:43,654 --> 01:37:46,907
Us here in the dark,
in about 70 years?

973
01:38:43,965 --> 01:38:44,798
What?

974
01:38:45,925 --> 01:38:46,760
I'm alive.

975
01:38:54,225 --> 01:38:55,060
I'm alive.

976
01:38:57,854 --> 01:38:58,688
We win!

977
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:42,606
How many dead
people are down here?

978
01:39:42,815 --> 01:39:45,191
What would a woman
be doing in war time?

979
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:48,113
She could be a
prisoner, spy, or,

980
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:52,615
We had a chance!

981
01:39:52,617 --> 01:39:55,660
You win, boss. But
you not understand.

982
01:39:55,662 --> 01:39:58,832
Here in the dark,
in about 70 years.

983
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:05,755
Only one, forever.

984
01:40:06,797 --> 01:40:09,425
You must die.

985
01:40:22,646 --> 01:40:23,564
Can't be.

986
01:40:26,693 --> 01:40:27,527
No!

987
01:41:51,903 --> 01:41:52,779
What are you!

988
01:41:56,032 --> 01:41:56,949
Get off me!

989
01:42:05,332 --> 01:42:07,125
Still breathing.

990
01:42:07,127 --> 01:42:09,501
Only one.

991
01:42:09,503 --> 01:42:16,219
- What are you trying to tell us?
- You. Must. Die.

992
01:46:28,512 --> 01:46:31,555
Paulina? I'm coming for you!

993
01:46:31,557 --> 01:46:32,391
Taxi!

994
