00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:26,900
<i>Tomaz?</i>

3
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:46,179
Oi, why don't you lot
fuck off back home?

4
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:04,865
First day?

5
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,567
Watch your toes.

6
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:09,670
It's dangerous work, man.

7
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:50,971
Halt!

8
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,677
Halt!

9
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,705
Get out of here, now!

10
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,075
Fire! It's everywhere!

11
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,828
Who tied you up?

12
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:25,065
Friends. It was a joke.

13
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,235
How long
have you been here?

14
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:34,207
I'm not sure. Two years?

15
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,386
I had a bag.

16
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:47,421
Speak to the orderly.

17
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:49,123
She said there's
a message for you.

18
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,840
Like the lamb,
he did return into the fold.

19
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:16,142
Into the blessed light.

20
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,014
I hope I got them all.

21
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:24,884
Thank you.

22
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:32,325
There are many like you
who seek refuge here.

23
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:40,467
The war is over.
I could go back.

24
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:42,202
Why don't you?

25
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,877
Thank you for this.

26
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,379
You're a philosopher.

27
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:56,883
No, I'm a builder.

28
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,021
Really?

29
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,457
Is something missing?

30
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:10,329
I had some money.

31
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:13,434
Uh... I didn't find
any money, I'm afraid.

32
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,175
Thank you.

33
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:30,017
Forward is not
the only way, Tomaz.

34
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:34,021
There are other roads.

35
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:02,148
Come on.

36
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:37,417
Magda.

37
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,055
My dear child,
it has been too long.

38
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,558
It has been a month, Sister.

39
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,728
I told you., Magda.

40
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,632
My work at the church...

41
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:54,634
Yours is not the only
suffering, child.

42
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:59,606
Anyway, I come bearing gifts.

43
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,009
Who is he?

44
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,744
This is Tomaz.

45
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:07,080
He wants to help you,
don't you, Tomaz?

46
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:10,183
You have no need
to fear him, my dear.

47
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:13,353
It is time.

48
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,409
Oh, you've made
your first mistake here, Tomaz.

49
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:39,379
You'll learn not to refuse
Magda's cooking.

50
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:43,650
It's meat.

51
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,733
Did she eat today?

52
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:03,036
Nothing past her lips all week.

53
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:05,438
Something has upset her?

54
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:09,275
She knows the end is coming.

55
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:16,550
Magda's mother
lives on the top floor.

56
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:20,253
Unfortunately, she's an invalid.

57
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,757
She's very ill
and in great pain.

58
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,493
Unable to leave the house.

59
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:31,098
Magda is tasked with the sole
responsibility of her care.

60
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,333
It is a tremendous strain.

61
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,270
Especially as her mother
doesn't like Magda to...

62
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,439
socialize.

63
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:46,313
The Lord will take her soon.

64
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:05,899
Peace, quiet,
home-cooked food.

65
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:08,401
What more
could the bachelor want?

66
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:46,906
How much?

67
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:51,144
We don't need your money.

68
00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:54,314
Sure you don't.

69
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:58,450
I told you,
didn't I? At no charge!

70
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:00,320
If you just help a bit
in the house,

71
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:02,456
'cause it's falling down
around their ears!

72
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,168
I must go to her.

73
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:21,608
<i>She doesn't want me here.</i>

74
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:22,942
What we want

75
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,679
isn't always
what we need, Tomaz.

76
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:28,315
I won't go
where I'm not welcome.

77
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:34,320
Fair enough.

78
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,557
It's getting late. We should go.

79
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:41,360
You... Fetch the child,
would you?

80
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:04,310
We don't have
electricity.

81
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,412
Only gas to heat water.

82
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:08,748
No electricity.

83
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:12,818
Mother, once her pain
was so great, she tried to...

84
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:15,488
put her fingers in the sockets.

85
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,435
It's stew.

86
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,703
Mm!

87
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,478
<i>I don't want you to wait on me.</i>

88
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:49,516
<i>That's not why I'm here.</i>

89
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:51,384
<i>Why are you here?</i>

90
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:58,892
<i>To help you.</i>

91
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,397
Mother won't like it.

92
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:47,633
Run, if you like.

93
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:51,036
I won't chase you.

94
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:59,879
The nearest village
is two days' walk that way.

95
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:04,217
But I don't think
you want to go there.

96
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,129
Help yourself.

97
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:28,274
If you're heading
for the border,

98
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:30,008
you'll never get across.

99
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:32,045
They'll shoot you the second
you leave the trees.

100
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:33,580
Why even try?

101
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:40,786
My daughter is there.

102
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:48,929
They say a peace deal
is coming.

103
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:51,030
That it's months away.

104
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,670
You can stay here, wait.

105
00:24:58,136 --> 00:25:00,005
Then you'll be able to cross.

106
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:12,285
My mother is a dentist.

107
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:15,388
The Captain who came
with the first brigade,

108
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:17,891
she did a good job for his caps.

109
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,063
That's how I got sent out here.

110
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:26,765
She didn't want you
to play soldier?

111
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:28,795
They're gone.

112
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,324
(door opens

113
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,401
Breakfast.

114
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:27,406
Thank you. Maybe later.
My stomach is...

115
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:33,046
I haven't eaten a meal
like that in a long time.

116
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:36,149
What do you usually eat?

117
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:40,586
Don't really get hungry.

118
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:50,263
What is that?

119
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:54,400
We make it into tea.
It calms her.

120
00:30:09,213 --> 00:30:10,215
Mm.

121
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:37,036
- Don't touch that!
- Look, I want to help you!

122
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:44,576
Don't be like that.
It's natural.

123
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,713
There is a real problem
with the water.

124
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:49,415
I didn't ask you to come here.

125
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,402
A rat?

126
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,004
Rat with wings...

127
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:09,342
it's a bat of course.

128
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:13,879
You haven't seen one before?

129
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:15,648
In the house?

130
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:18,484
No.

131
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:22,754
I spent one year in the woods.
I used to see them all the time,

132
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:25,658
but I've never seen one
like this.

133
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:30,395
Can you take it away, please?

134
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:34,332
- Outside?
- Mm.

135
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,442
Thank you.

136
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:28,453
She beats you?

137
00:37:38,797 --> 00:37:39,899
She's in pain.

138
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,569
That's no excuse.

139
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:54,913
When I was young...

140
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:02,488
I remember feeling all the time
that she didn't want me.

141
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:07,093
That she would get away
if she could.

142
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:17,069
And yet she fed me,
she cared for me.

143
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,549
Are you going to care
for me too?

144
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:16,896
Found it in the woods.

145
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:21,434
Must be old.

146
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,036
A women guard.

147
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:31,977
An amulet.

148
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:35,781
Perhaps she will protect me.

149
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:49,160
Morning.

150
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:55,234
I'm going to the market.
You want to come?

151
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,636
What is that?

152
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,872
Use this old thing.

153
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:11,250
How long have you lived here?

154
00:40:12,183 --> 00:40:13,219
Many years.

155
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:17,122
The house belonged
to a man we knew.

156
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:21,093
But he left one day, suddenly.

157
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:25,196
Did he leave it to you?

158
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,700
I don't know.

159
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:34,573
I guess maybe we find out
if anyone comes to take it back.

160
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:38,276
Alright, love you.
You have a good day.

161
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,148
These ones.

162
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:50,122
And... this.

163
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,528
This one.

164
00:40:57,995 --> 00:40:59,631
Mm.

165
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:02,067
Do you like it here?

166
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:04,002
I don't know it.

167
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:07,573
This is as far as I've been
since the day we arrived.

168
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,779
You never go out?

169
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:46,611
What are you looking at?

170
00:41:53,752 --> 00:41:54,987
It's a love story.

171
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:57,922
You can borrow it if you want?

172
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:01,160
I've read it many times before.

173
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:05,197
No thanks.
I'm not into romance.

174
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:09,001
Men think romance is silly,
don't they?

175
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:14,640
They think it's not real love.

176
00:42:16,107 --> 00:42:17,343
<i>But what is love?</i>

177
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:20,345
<i>Sacrifice.</i>

178
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,114
<i>Nobody's romance.</i>

179
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,884
It's an offering.

180
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,689
What do you write?

181
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:34,927
In your room?

182
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:41,333
I can hear you at night.

183
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:51,410
It's my dissertation.

184
00:42:52,977 --> 00:42:54,212
For my doctorate.

185
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:57,149
And what's it about?

186
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,154
Philosophy, the study of ideas.

187
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:07,225
I know what philosophy is.

188
00:43:13,497 --> 00:43:16,000
Dare to declare who you are.

189
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:21,006
It is not far
from the shore of silence

190
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:23,708
to the boundaries of speech.

191
00:43:25,076 --> 00:43:28,847
The path is not long,
but the way is deep.

192
00:43:30,848 --> 00:43:32,917
You must not only walk there...

193
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,721
you must take a leap.

194
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:42,855
You are bleeding.

195
00:44:45,056 --> 00:44:46,358
Do you see it?

196
00:44:47,457 --> 00:44:49,026
I don't see anything.

197
00:44:55,866 --> 00:44:56,868
This shell...

198
00:45:01,138 --> 00:45:06,111
In the old times, it was painted
on the sides of houses

199
00:45:06,143 --> 00:45:08,513
as a warning against evil.

200
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:13,050
And in the war, they...

201
00:45:15,853 --> 00:45:17,189
They used it again.

202
00:45:21,926 --> 00:45:23,996
Did you kill people in the war?

203
00:45:36,506 --> 00:45:38,876
It's a sin to waste your life.

204
00:45:47,151 --> 00:45:51,123
If I were free,
I would dance every night.

205
00:45:52,556 --> 00:45:54,593
I would go to nightclubs.

206
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:13,444
You've got to take pleasure
where you can.

207
00:46:14,978 --> 00:46:15,980
Right?

208
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,289
Mama? Mama!

209
00:46:28,558 --> 00:46:31,430
<i>Mama!</i>

210
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:41,692
There were wires in the wall.

211
00:48:43,227 --> 00:48:45,129
I thought I'd got them all.

212
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:02,080
Are you shocked
to see her like this?

213
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,719
It's not my choice.

214
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:14,759
It has to be this way,
otherwise she harms herself.

215
00:49:18,296 --> 00:49:20,131
What is wrong with her?

216
00:49:21,098 --> 00:49:22,533
You don't understand.

217
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:25,737
She used to be so beautiful.

218
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:42,821
You see.

219
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:17,122
Why didn't you tell me?

220
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,756
This is crazy.

221
00:50:23,393 --> 00:50:24,796
Please don't go.

222
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:10,674
<i>Why didn't you go with her?</i>

223
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:12,677
<i>Your daughter?</i>

224
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,915
<i>Her father took her
across the border to safety.</i>

225
00:51:17,948 --> 00:51:20,184
<i>He couldn't hide us
both in the car.</i>

226
00:51:31,596 --> 00:51:32,564
You're married?

227
00:51:34,598 --> 00:51:35,600
No.

228
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:38,602
We divorced.

229
00:51:39,236 --> 00:51:41,605
Why are you still
wearing your ring?

230
00:51:43,774 --> 00:51:46,478
I put my ring back on
when the soldiers came.

231
00:51:47,444 --> 00:51:49,247
I thought it would protect me.

232
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:56,587
You worked in the Town Hall?

233
00:52:05,529 --> 00:52:08,567
I had to get papers
for my university application.

234
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,238
I waited an hour in that line.

235
00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:17,841
You never looked up
once from your work.

236
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:22,647
I wanted you to look up,
but the whole time I was there,

237
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,683
you never did.

238
00:52:31,721 --> 00:52:36,428
My daughter.
I always had to leave at 5:00.

239
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,600
You never saw me?

240
00:52:46,803 --> 00:52:48,339
I don't remember you.

241
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:26,337
You're back.

242
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:30,874
The house needs work.

243
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:41,618
Can you make her
some tea tonight?

244
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,587
Why?

245
00:54:44,788 --> 00:54:46,757
I don't want to eat
alone any more.

246
00:55:32,669 --> 00:55:34,071
She's sleeping.

247
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:39,443
I made cake too.

248
00:55:39,477 --> 00:55:41,980
Lucky I'm so greedy.

249
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:51,656
Do you have any other shoes?

250
00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:53,558
Shoes?

251
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:56,694
You can't dance in those.

252
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:07,604
<i>Thank you.
Where did you get it?</i>

253
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:10,874
<i>The house
is full of things.</i>

254
00:56:11,075 --> 00:56:12,743
<i>Very few of them are ours.</i>

255
00:59:26,937 --> 00:59:28,239
You are running.

256
00:59:29,172 --> 00:59:30,174
Why?

257
00:59:34,377 --> 00:59:37,347
You think I know nothing
of the world, you are wrong.

258
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:40,984
The very worst troubles,
secrets.

259
00:59:41,986 --> 00:59:45,690
The deepest pains of existence
find their way into these walls.

260
00:59:45,723 --> 00:59:47,725
This is not a sanctuary.

261
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:49,861
This is a crucible.

262
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:55,165
You can tell me.

263
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:03,174
I made a mistake.

264
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,412
We all do.

265
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:12,315
I tried to help someone.

266
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,056
They got hurt.

267
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:27,432
Maybe you need to go home.

268
01:00:27,631 --> 01:00:29,900
There are other ways.

269
01:00:31,902 --> 01:00:34,472
- I am afraid.
- There are worse things.

270
01:00:39,276 --> 01:00:40,812
Before your God...

271
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,816
the Ancients, they didn't
believe that you could.

272
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:48,018
What?

273
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,256
Forgive yourself.

274
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:54,926
It wasn't yours to give.

275
01:00:57,227 --> 01:00:58,863
What do you believe?

276
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,586
No, no, no, no.

277
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,890
No. I can't.

278
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:05,196
- What are you talking about?
- Please don't.

279
01:02:06,529 --> 01:02:09,167
Tomaz, what's wrong?

280
01:02:13,937 --> 01:02:15,239
Don't be afraid.

281
01:02:36,593 --> 01:02:38,196
She can see us.

282
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:45,303
Mama, don't be angry

283
01:02:46,502 --> 01:02:49,873
I know it hurts,
but who will care for me

284
01:02:49,906 --> 01:02:51,875
after you're gone?

285
01:02:53,643 --> 01:02:54,846
Let go.

286
01:03:01,183 --> 01:03:02,185
Mother.

287
01:03:10,627 --> 01:03:12,163
The end is coming.

288
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:18,870
I'll call the police.

289
01:03:19,236 --> 01:03:20,238
No!

290
01:03:22,004 --> 01:03:23,173
No-one else!

291
01:03:24,373 --> 01:03:25,375
Promise...

292
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:27,510
Promise me.

293
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:30,614
Swear it. Swear it.

294
01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:46,623
It's always like this,
around her time.

295
01:04:54,364 --> 01:04:56,000
I should have known.

296
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:08,111
Jesus Christ.

297
01:05:24,627 --> 01:05:25,729
I have to.

298
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,599
They're born with teeth.

299
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,181
A demon.

300
01:05:48,685 --> 01:05:50,353
Do you know what a demon is?

301
01:05:52,388 --> 01:05:55,125
The demon's essence is evil.

302
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:56,761
Pure evil.

303
01:05:57,428 --> 01:05:59,763
But evil isn't simply
an idea, Tomaz.

304
01:05:59,796 --> 01:06:02,098
Through its body,

305
01:06:02,431 --> 01:06:05,669
it delivers evil.

306
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:09,607
It becomes tangible.

307
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,109
It bites.

308
01:06:14,277 --> 01:06:17,048
Magda is its slave?

309
01:06:21,384 --> 01:06:23,687
These creatures
can live centuries.

310
01:06:23,919 --> 01:06:25,355
They need to be cared for.

311
01:06:25,888 --> 01:06:29,325
They need... companionship.

312
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:36,799
But it's nearing the end now.

313
01:06:36,832 --> 01:06:39,202
It is dying. Finally.

314
01:06:40,636 --> 01:06:42,439
So Magda will be free?

315
01:06:43,274 --> 01:06:46,444
No Master will let its slave
outlive it.

316
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:51,614
This is my duty.

317
01:06:52,314 --> 01:06:55,752
Has been our duty
through the ages.

318
01:06:56,652 --> 01:06:57,654
Duty?

319
01:06:58,154 --> 01:07:01,158
Evil must be contained, Tomaz.

320
01:07:04,294 --> 01:07:08,799
So you gave her to that thing?

321
01:07:09,232 --> 01:07:11,634
I tried to make things
bearable for them.

322
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:19,877
Why am I here?

323
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:23,279
It is your destiny.

324
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:49,205
You will protect her, won't you?

325
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:14,230
You're back.

326
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:20,571
Again.

327
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:26,509
Why are you here?

328
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:29,846
- To free you.
- And how will you do it?

329
01:08:32,715 --> 01:08:33,850
I will kill it.

330
01:08:34,283 --> 01:08:36,252
What if it kills you first?

331
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:41,457
It's weak. Dying, she said.

332
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:43,661
You're a coward.

333
01:08:45,929 --> 01:08:47,398
You don't know me.

334
01:08:53,769 --> 01:08:55,805
You know nothing about me
at all.

335
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:20,918
Don't.

336
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:23,554
Leave him be.

337
01:11:29,826 --> 01:11:31,729
We belong together.

338
01:12:00,456 --> 01:12:02,859
There's no escape.

339
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:11,568
Tomaz.

340
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:15,172
You have to go now.

341
01:12:19,908 --> 01:12:20,978
I will not.

342
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:23,480
Leave us.

343
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:00,451
What are you doing?

344
01:13:04,153 --> 01:13:06,490
You'll die out there
in the woods.

345
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,792
Or they will catch you.

346
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:12,796
Thank you for all you've
done for me.

347
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:18,968
You're a good man.

348
01:13:34,283 --> 01:13:35,486
You can't go.

349
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:43,594
Why?

350
01:13:47,663 --> 01:13:48,831
You need me.

351
01:14:04,212 --> 01:14:06,983
Don't run.

352
01:14:15,123 --> 01:14:16,126
Don't.

353
01:14:45,153 --> 01:14:48,157
- How long have I...?
- Two days.

354
01:14:59,135 --> 01:15:00,938
I failed you.

355
01:15:15,018 --> 01:15:16,886
I told myself...

356
01:15:19,988 --> 01:15:21,991
if I could free you...

357
01:15:24,693 --> 01:15:27,598
then I would have a right
to be happy again.

358
01:15:35,671 --> 01:15:36,906
Listen to me.

359
01:15:42,144 --> 01:15:43,779
There is something...

360
01:15:50,286 --> 01:15:51,888
inside me...

361
01:15:54,857 --> 01:15:56,926
and it's stronger than me.

362
01:16:02,698 --> 01:16:06,236
I have not always done...

363
01:16:09,104 --> 01:16:10,107
right.

364
01:16:17,112 --> 01:16:18,114
But...

365
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,719
I'm a good man, Magda.

366
01:16:27,055 --> 01:16:28,658
I am a good man.

367
01:17:33,089 --> 01:17:35,192
<i>You slept like a baby.</i>

368
01:17:38,094 --> 01:17:39,895
<i>I didn't dream.</i>

369
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:44,067
<i>You forgave yourself.</i>

370
01:18:36,251 --> 01:18:37,987
You'll feel better now.

371
01:18:43,425 --> 01:18:45,194
Better out than in.

372
01:18:46,127 --> 01:18:47,330
That's what they say, isn't it?

373
01:18:48,331 --> 01:18:51,334
Oh, yes, do you like it?

374
01:18:51,367 --> 01:18:52,903
Such a relief!

375
01:18:53,135 --> 01:18:55,971
Never felt I totally convinced
as a nun.

376
01:18:56,339 --> 01:18:58,241
I never quite got the...

377
01:18:59,942 --> 01:19:01,278
Couldn't get the walk.

378
01:19:04,313 --> 01:19:05,448
Who are you?

379
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:10,921
Someone you're going
to get to know very well.

380
01:19:16,358 --> 01:19:17,960
What is happening to me?

381
01:19:20,295 --> 01:19:21,530
Let's have a look.

382
01:19:43,986 --> 01:19:46,223
As I said,
a demon's essence is evil.

383
01:19:49,492 --> 01:19:51,361
Why?

384
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:56,265
I think you know the answer
to that, don't you?

385
01:20:32,134 --> 01:20:33,303
So...

386
01:20:34,636 --> 01:20:37,107
let's get started.

387
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:42,511
I wonder who the lucky girl
will be.

388
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:46,449
What do you think you'll be
wanting in your candidates?

389
01:20:47,183 --> 01:20:48,218
Candidates?

390
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:50,185
Companion, of course.

391
01:20:57,626 --> 01:20:58,929
I want her.

392
01:21:01,063 --> 01:21:04,634
She has served her time.

393
01:21:06,535 --> 01:21:09,706
Anyway I thought you wanted
to free her.

394
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:11,273
I want her.

395
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:18,348
She is still taken.

396
01:21:24,153 --> 01:21:25,255
I want her.

397
01:21:27,322 --> 01:21:28,524
Well...

398
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,696
you'd better go
and finish it then.

399
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:42,912
<i>The house belonged
to a man we knew.</i>

400
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,719
<i>But he left one day, suddenly.</i>

401
01:25:53,322 --> 01:25:54,623
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

402
01:26:04,433 --> 01:26:06,236
<i>The house
was full of things.</i>

403
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:08,837
<i>Very few of them were ours.</i>

404
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,382
<i>The shell...</i>

405
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:23,987
<i>was a warning against evil.</i>

406
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:19,901
<i>Welcome, Tomaz.</i>

407
01:28:23,871 --> 01:28:26,575
<i>Don't you find me beautiful
anymore?</i>

408
01:28:28,977 --> 01:28:32,547
<i>You used to find me beautiful,
didn't you?</i>

409
01:28:37,685 --> 01:28:41,556
Isn't this what you wanted,
Tomaz?

410
01:29:22,063 --> 01:29:24,032
It comes so quick.

411
01:29:25,267 --> 01:29:26,935
He was ripe.

412
01:29:27,603 --> 01:29:28,938
You chose well.

413
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:34,576
They chose their own path.

414
01:29:37,112 --> 01:29:39,582
You had every chance, boy.

415
01:29:41,649 --> 01:29:42,884
Please.

416
01:29:48,657 --> 01:29:50,560
Ate well, didn't you?

417
01:29:51,227 --> 01:29:55,497
Well, now it's time to pay
for your meal.

418
01:30:30,098 --> 01:30:32,268
Don't be scared Tomaz.

419
01:30:35,037 --> 01:30:37,673
You'll make a wonderful mother.

420
01:31:32,126 --> 01:31:33,295
You sure you want those?

421
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:36,598
I wouldn't feed them to a pig.

422
01:31:43,371 --> 01:31:44,573
Well...

423
01:31:46,407 --> 01:31:48,143
I fucking hate cooking.

424
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:53,349
Okay.

425
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:57,987
Tourist?

426
01:31:59,086 --> 01:32:00,221
Kind of.

427
01:32:00,554 --> 01:32:03,191
We didn't have any tourists
for a long time.

428
01:32:06,662 --> 01:32:08,197
But now they're coming back.

429
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:09,831
That's good.

430
01:32:09,864 --> 01:32:11,300
Yeah, I guess.

431
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,277
We've all got to move on, right?

432
01:32:27,014 --> 01:32:29,285
Forget and move on.

433
01:32:34,922 --> 01:32:36,058
Never forget.

434
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:30,011
Eat up, baby!

435
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:55,261
