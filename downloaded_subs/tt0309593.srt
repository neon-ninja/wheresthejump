1
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,128
Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary

2
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,964
since Velez Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,300
shortly after takeoff
from JFK Airport.

4
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,468
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,305
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School,

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,475
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,895
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,148
that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

9
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:43,027
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,154
died soon thereafter
in a series

11
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,656
of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.

12
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,118
Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,

13
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,162
but to others,
they're an indication

14
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,831
that there are more
sinister events taking place.

15
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,833
That's the contention
of tonight's guest.

16
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,793
Thank you for joining us
this evening.

17
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:01,462
Thank you for having me.

18
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,589
And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.

19
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:06,258
Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking

20
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:09,637
about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,306
Here's your chance
to set the record straight.

22
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,808
Great. Okay.

23
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:18,479
I believe that there's
a sort of force,

24
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:22,483
an unseen malevolent
presence...

25
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,485
that's all around us
every day.

26
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:28,030
And it determines
when we live and die.

27
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:32,493
And some people call
this force the devil,

28
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:35,162
but I think that
whole religious thing is...

29
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:38,499
so I prefer to call it
Death itself.

30
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:41,168
So I'm surrounded by Death?

31
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,337
Absolutely. Absolutely.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,840
Every day, everywhere,
all the time.

33
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:49,510
And that's what I want people
to understand...

34
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,512
that Death
has this grand design

35
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,680
that we all fit into.

36
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:56,517
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,685
and took the other
survivors with him,

38
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,271
he basically screwed up
Death's plan.

39
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,108
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

40
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,277
And the fact that all
of the survivors have died

41
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,530
is your evidence of this?

42
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,118
Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,

43
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,328
but it's the way
that they died.

44
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,790
I mean, there were
so many weird,

45
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,668
seemingly random things
about the way they died.

46
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:26,463
It just didn't
make sense.

47
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,466
And that's the proof
there's something out there...

48
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,220
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation

49
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:36,348
of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

50
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:38,475
Kimberly.

51
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,811
You should be more
open-minded...

52
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,689
What happened after that
was just coincidence.

53
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,774
May I finish?

54
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,819
Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

55
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,155
But not all of them
including their teachers.

56
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,657
Yes, but people die
all the time,

57
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,160
so why should this be
any different?

58
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,620
It forced people
to question

59
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,248
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

60
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,250
What if they
were something more?

61
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,419
What if you could do
something about it?

62
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:08,255
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

63
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:11,633
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

64
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,428
That's exactly what
I'm saying.

65
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,763
Exactly it.

66
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:18,640
And in order
to survive...

67
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,143
the only way to survive

68
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,478
is to look beneath
the visible world.

69
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:27,482
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

70
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,152
And today may be
your day to die.

71
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,458
Okay, I'll call you.

72
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,627
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

73
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,795
Credit card,
cell phone, Triple-A card?

74
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,298
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

75
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:55,135
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares,
sunblock, mace?

76
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:57,638
Condoms,
whips, chains.

77
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,307
Just kidding,
Mr. Corman.

78
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,225
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

79
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,937
That makes me feel
a lot better, thanks.

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,398
- Okay.
- Alrighty.

81
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,652
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.

82
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:15,739
Go on.

83
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,991
Okay, I'll call you.

84
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,913
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

85
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,248
Whatever,
your dad's cool.

86
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,379
Buckle up!

87
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,450
Watch it!

88
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,745
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.

89
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,044
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.

90
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,340
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

91
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,300
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

92
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:20,929
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

93
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,180
Whatever.

94
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,599
What are we going to do
in Daytona?

95
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,893
We're going to see lots
of honeys there.

96
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,855
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke
this big 'El Gagerero,'

97
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,731
We're gonna have this
awesome party...

98
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:34,401
Pileup! Pileup!

99
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:47,581
A candlelight vigil to mark
the one year anniversary

100
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:50,750
of the crash of Flight 180
will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

101
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,919
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

102
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:56,423
# Highway to hell... #

103
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,189
Oh my God.

104
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:18,236
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.

105
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:21,573
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.

106
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,159
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.

107
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,785
I'll do that.

108
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,829
I mean it. Take care of it.

109
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,458
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.

110
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,752
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,629
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.

112
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,382
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!

113
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,969
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!

114
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,307
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

115
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,477
Oh, shit!

116
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,438
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!

117
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:54,981
Shit.

118
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,200
Seriously, put it out.

119
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,369
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.

120
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,954
Wait, wait, wait!

121
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,747
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.

122
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,794
Hey, it's Kat.

123
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,879
Listen...
what the hell?!

124
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,756
Just wait. Not you.

125
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,566
I think we better pull over
and check the car, because...

126
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,069
Kimberly, the car
is going to be fine.

127
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,406
Your dad's going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

128
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,282
Okay?

129
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,730
Look at that guy.

130
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,942
He's drinking a beer.

131
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,447
Oh, yeah,
that's real responsible.

132
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:02,025
You ever hear
of the ozone layer, arsehole?!

133
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:32,722
# When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play #

134
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:37,101
# Don't come around if
you ain't got no cocaine to bring... #

135
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,237
What? I'm wearing
my seatbelt.

136
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,989
You're gonna bust me,
bitch?!

137
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:06,756
Aaah!

138
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,341
Son of a...

139
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:10,843
bitch.

140
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,483
Fuck!

141
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,227
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!

142
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,187
- Stop!
- Oh my God!

143
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:05,106
Watch out!
Aaah!

144
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,985
Shaina?

145
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,867
I can't get out of here!

146
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,162
Help me!

147
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,009
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?

148
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,275
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

149
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,528
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

150
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,780
Pileup! Pileup!

151
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,617
- Oh my God.
- What?

152
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:41,619
There's going to be
a huge accident.

153
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,496
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.

154
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,081
That's it.
My turn to drive.

155
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,667
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?

156
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,630
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

157
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,633
...of Flight 180 will be held
at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

158
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:58,010
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

159
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:01,597
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '

160
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,224
'Highway to hell'?

161
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,685
# I'm on a highway to hell... #

162
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,395
Okay, Kimberly,
you're scaring me.

163
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,941
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,284
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?

165
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,743
What the fuck, Kimberly?

166
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,956
What's this?

167
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,922
Kimberly, you just got
to breathe.

168
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,758
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.

169
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,635
- What?
- Oh my God.

170
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,554
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me? Huh?

171
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:44,223
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.

172
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,608
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

173
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,915
What's going on here?

174
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,293
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

175
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,420
I saw it.

176
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,422
There were bodies
everywhere.

177
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,424
There were logs...
I saw it.

178
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:20,176
It just happened.

179
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,471
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please
step out of the vehicle.

180
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,442
Just pull over!

181
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,986
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.

182
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,617
Come on.

183
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,077
Come on!

184
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,121
Oh, fuck this.

185
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:52,500
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

186
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:06,138
Fuck.

187
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,474
What the hell
is going on up there?

188
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,017
Excuse me!

189
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,686
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

190
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,689
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.

191
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,608
- Just move it...
- Now!

192
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,615
That's it!

193
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,160
That's the truck
that's going to kill everybody.

194
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:29,954
You need to stop
that truck!

195
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,872
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

196
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,583
Why won't you listen to me?!

197
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,421
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

198
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,098
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

199
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,767
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

200
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,061
Kimberly, what's going on?

201
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,212
No!

202
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:22,256
No!

203
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,568
Listen, sir,
this girl is really freaked out.

204
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:43,861
In fact, all of them are...

205
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:46,071
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!

206
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:49,408
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

207
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:50,909
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis...

208
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:52,745
yesterday the kid
wins the lotto.

209
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,747
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

210
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,749
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

211
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,584
I should be
so damn 'unlucky.'

212
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,085
Go babysit the rest of them.

213
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,879
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

214
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:05,049
Hey, excuse me...

215
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,884
We're trying to do
the best we can.

216
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,553
We're going to get you
out of here as soon as possible.

217
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,264
I just think it's a bunch
of bullshit.

218
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,064
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

219
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:21,940
with Detective Suby...

220
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,445
but would you mind
telling me what happened?

221
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,115
It was like I was there.

222
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:36,288
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

223
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:41,835
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?

224
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,051
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

225
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,512
you guys all heard
about Flight 180, right?

226
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,639
The kid who got off
the plane?

227
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:55,849
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

228
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,063
My premonition
was just like his.

229
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,028
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

230
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,780
You must have read
about the kid

231
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:11,782
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

232
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:13,784
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

233
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,578
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

234
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,122
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

235
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,459
So a month goes by, right?

236
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,628
Everything seems cool.

237
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,590
But then all the survivors
start to die one by one.

238
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,385
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

239
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:38,308
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them,

240
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,644
hunting each one down

241
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:44,273
until they were all...
dead.

242
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,903
Please.

243
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,699
There was one survivor.

244
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,494
Clear Rivers is
in a padded room

245
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,289
at the Stonybrook Institution.

246
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,999
Well, that's encouraging.

247
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,462
Okay, you want me
to believe that this is true,

248
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,299
that this is happening
all over again?

249
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,509
I don't know why
we're even here.

250
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,637
What do you want from me?

251
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,473
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

252
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,018
we all should have died
in that pileup.

253
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,103
Which means Death
could be coming for us.

254
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,980
Yeah, like, what if

255
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:28,650
we're all getting that 'Different Strokes'
curse or something?

256
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,486
I think you're all
are certifiable.

257
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,655
I can't believe I've been listening
to this crap.

258
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,491
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.

259
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,369
Mrs. Carpenter, please.

260
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,043
Kimberly!

261
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:49,296
Oh baby!

262
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,008
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

263
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,634
Shh, shh.

264
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,095
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

265
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,534
Could I ask you something?

266
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,037
Anything.

267
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:24,873
Did Mum ever have any...

268
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:28,543
I don't know,
weird feelings about anything?

269
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,379
What do you mean?

270
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:37,594
Like visions or premonitions.

271
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,056
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

272
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,892
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

273
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:46,228
but I'm really scared
for the others.

274
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,107
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.

275
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,943
What?

276
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,613
It's not over yet.

277
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:21,680
Jesus Christ!

278
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,723
Shit!

279
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:57,025
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.

280
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,027
Sorry I haven't called.

281
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,821
Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.

282
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:04,532
Let's hook up.
Call me.

283
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,993
Yeah.

284
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,828
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.

285
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:11,039
We met at Tucker's party
last year?

286
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:13,708
I know it's been awhile,
but I've been thinking about you.

287
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,503
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

288
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,546
So give me a call.

289
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,882
555-0123. Bye.

290
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,386
You little bastard.

291
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,137
Shit.

292
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,895
Come on.
Come on.

293
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,279
Fuck. Fuck.

294
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:55,375
Come on!

295
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,127
Come on.

296
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,968
Fuck!

297
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:06,427
Jesus!

298
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:15,562
Oh!

299
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,404
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.

300
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,990
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,

301
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,826
and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.

302
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:33,872
Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!

303
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,527
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

304
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:06,362
Aah!

305
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,311
Jesus!

306
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,567
Come on.

307
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:54,243
Aah!

308
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,873
Shit, I'm lucky.

309
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,169
Aah!

310
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:08,216
Jesus Christ!

311
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:36,137
No, Mother,

312
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,890
just turn on any station.

313
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:42,143
Well, I don't know how you missed it,
it's been on all day.

314
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,812
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.

315
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,982
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?

316
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,984
I got to go!

317
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,820
To recap our top story,

318
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,490
Route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

319
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,660
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

320
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,788
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

321
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,958
hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.

322
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:09,003
So far police are refusing
to release the names of the victims

323
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,796
until the families
are notified.

324
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,715
The camera
of a highway patrol car

325
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,717
managed to catch
this shocking footage.

326
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,844
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.

327
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,804
And smashes
into a red SUV.

328
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,475
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...

329
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,976
leave it.

330
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,478
...may have
saved her life.

331
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,396
He pulled her back
at the last second

332
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:29,523
just as the semi ploughed
into the vehicle.

333
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,359
The passengers inside
the SUV...

334
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:34,236
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

335
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:38,282
In other news, a freak accident took
the life of a lotto winner.

336
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,201
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.

337
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:43,996
Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.

338
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:46,791
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today

339
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:49,418
while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.

340
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:51,253
He managed to make it out
of the building,

341
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,506
but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape

342
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,508
slipped and impaled him.

343
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,094
Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.

344
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:08,312
Come in.

345
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:11,649
Hey, buddy.

346
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,986
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

347
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,158
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist,
which I know you love.

348
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,662
Now, get some rest.

349
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,794
- Mum.
- Yeah?

350
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,921
You think those guys
were BSing us today?

351
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:35,756
Yeah.

352
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,259
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

353
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,178
Lights out.

354
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,715
At the request
of the patient,

355
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,801
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

356
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:46,220
such as: 'nail files,
pencils, pens,

357
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:49,223
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

358
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:51,892
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

359
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,062
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

360
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:58,190
paper clips, watches, money clip,
pocket knives,

361
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,901
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone... '

362
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,153
You have a cell phone
on you?

363
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:06,156
'... poisons, pills,
medications.'

364
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,826
Great. And let me see
your nails.

365
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:11,495
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

366
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:13,497
Wait.

367
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,499
Is she dangerous
or something?

368
00:32:15,582 --> 00:32:17,543
No, honey,
she expects you are.

369
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,340
No, no, no.

370
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:26,635
Get him off me.
Get him off me!

371
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:36,770
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

372
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,314
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

373
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:10,012
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

374
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:21,815
They told me you had something to do
with the crash on Route 23.

375
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,818
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

376
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,197
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

377
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,783
And I saved some people.

378
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,203
And now you think Death
is after you.

379
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:38,040
Nice work.

380
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:41,376
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

381
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,630
Anything else?

382
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:47,174
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

383
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:49,343
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

384
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:51,803
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

385
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,181
List? What list?

386
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:56,433
Death's list.

387
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,146
The survivors of Flight 180

388
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,482
died in the exact order

389
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,360
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

390
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:09,529
That was Death's original design.

391
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,532
The list.

392
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:15,077
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

393
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:16,828
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

394
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,081
You said someone else died
last night.

395
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:21,208
That means someone must
have intervened.

396
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:25,545
Officer Burke pulled me away
from the crash that killed my friends.

397
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,506
Congratulations.

398
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:30,175
You'll be the last to go.

399
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,844
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

400
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,554
it'll come back for you.

401
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,933
It always does.

402
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:40,978
This doesn't make sense.

403
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:45,399
You said that you die in
the order you're originally meant to.

404
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:49,236
But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.

405
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,279
Wait.

406
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,741
Died last?

407
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:58,620
Backwards.

408
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:00,747
Are you sure?

409
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,459
In my premonition

410
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:06,461
that Nora woman
and her kid died.

411
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:09,673
Then Evan,
then me and my friends.

412
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:14,845
Why is this even
happening to me?

413
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:21,685
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

414
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:25,647
So, what am I
supposed to do?

415
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:27,691
Clear.

416
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,153
Watch out for the signs.

417
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:32,946
What?

418
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:38,410
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

419
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:41,204
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

420
00:35:43,582 --> 00:35:46,001
The songs on the radio.

421
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:49,045
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

422
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:51,381
Well, don't ignore it.

423
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:55,093
Recognizing those signs usually means
the difference between life and death.

424
00:35:55,218 --> 00:35:57,637
You got to help me.

425
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,347
I don't have
to do anything.

426
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,141
But you beat it.

427
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:02,976
Take a look around.

428
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:05,020
What did I beat, Kimberly?

429
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:10,609
If you were smart, you'd save yourself
and just forget about the others.

430
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:13,278
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

431
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,489
My friends are dead.

432
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,532
That's how I can say that.

433
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:22,746
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

434
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:25,832
Get out.

435
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,293
Before you hurt me or yourself.

436
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:35,050
- Alright, you know what?
- What?

437
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,510
I think you're a coward.

438
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:38,220
You hide out in here
because you're

439
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:41,515
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

440
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:43,517
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

441
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:23,556
I tried calling you
last night,

442
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,642
but your father said
you were sleeping.

443
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,435
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

444
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,814
I've been getting calls all morning from
everyone who was on the on-ramp.

445
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:33,024
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

446
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:36,361
Wait, so...
you believe all this Death stuff?

447
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,156
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

448
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,325
Until last year
when I was dispatched

449
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,703
to clean up one
of the Flight 180 survivors.

450
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:46,538
Clean up, I don't...

451
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:53,586
- Did you see that?
- See what?

452
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,172
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

453
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:58,174
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

454
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:00,010
If Clear's right
about the order,

455
00:38:00,093 --> 00:38:03,263
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

456
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:04,848
I'm not following you.

457
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,599
They're next
on Death's list.

458
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:09,144
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

459
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,860
The doctor's ready
for you, now.

460
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:00,779
If he gives me the gas

461
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:02,947
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

462
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:06,576
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.

463
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,962
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?

464
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:18,797
We missed you in here.

465
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:21,424
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.

466
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:24,177
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

467
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,014
Your mum says you've been
having some pain lately.

468
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:30,308
Not really.

469
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,502
I'm disappointed, Tim.

470
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:58,920
Does your mum know
you've been smoking?

471
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:02,173
Uh-huh.
Ow.

472
00:40:02,298 --> 00:40:04,384
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

473
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,595
Damn those pigeons.

474
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,099
How many times am I going to have to
replace those goddamn windows?

475
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,354
We can't do it, boss,
we can't do it!

476
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:19,065
This will only sting for a moment.

477
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,359
Open big.

478
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:23,027
Little bit wider.

479
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:25,029
Wider.

480
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:27,574
Okay.

481
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,868
Oh God.

482
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:32,787
How do they
expect me to...

483
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:35,456
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

484
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,792
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,711
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

486
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:44,507
You'll have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

487
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,554
What?!
I can't hear you!

488
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:51,723
Excuse me, what?!

489
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,810
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

490
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:58,604
Jean! Let me
get this started.

491
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,442
Tim, you'll be awake,
a little groggy,

492
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,652
but you're not going
to be able to move much.

493
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:32,263
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.

494
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:35,600
The cleaning lady said they're at
the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

495
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:42,315
God damn it anyway.

496
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:51,783
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

497
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:55,620
Not again. Careful.

498
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:38,663
There we go.

499
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:50,007
Jean,
how's Tim doing in there?

500
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:56,806
What did he say
about your tooth?

501
00:42:56,889 --> 00:42:59,183
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.

502
00:42:59,308 --> 00:43:00,935
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

503
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:03,271
What? Pigeons?

504
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:07,066
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

505
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:10,861
- No-oo!
- Tim!

506
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:12,154
Look out!

507
00:43:13,906 --> 00:43:16,325
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

508
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,929
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

509
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:40,975
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.

510
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:02,246
This is really
happening again, isn't it?

511
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:06,542
I hoped we'd get there

512
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,544
and they'd be fine,

513
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:10,880
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

514
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:14,759
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

515
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,929
But we're all going to die,
aren't we?

516
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:25,269
I'm so scared.

517
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:29,231
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

518
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:32,985
but I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

519
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:43,245
A second one just died.

520
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:45,122
A 15-year-old kid.

521
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,293
I hope you're ready for this.

522
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,431
It's this way.

523
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,228
How is this guy going
to help us anyway?

524
00:45:07,353 --> 00:45:09,730
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

525
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:11,774
about Death
than he ever told us.

526
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:17,905
Shouldn't we knock first?

527
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,282
He probably already knows
we're coming.

528
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,582
Hello, Clear.

529
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:17,339
I've been expecting you.

530
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:19,383
Oh my God.

531
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,679
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

532
00:46:23,762 --> 00:46:26,932
Just a simple question and we'll leave you
alone with your new friend.

533
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:30,561
Dead...

534
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:33,439
yet still fresh.

535
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:36,900
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

536
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:39,028
so if you happen to know
how to stop Death,

537
00:46:39,111 --> 00:46:40,863
it would be really great
if you told us.

538
00:46:41,947 --> 00:46:43,574
You can't cheat Death.

539
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:46,410
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

540
00:46:46,535 --> 00:46:49,371
You told me Death
has a distinct design.

541
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:52,750
But Alex and I cheated Death,
not once but dozens of times.

542
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,294
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

543
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:58,088
Such fire in you now.

544
00:46:58,213 --> 00:47:00,758
People are always
most alive

545
00:47:00,883 --> 00:47:02,551
just before they die.

546
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:04,386
Don't you think?

547
00:47:21,236 --> 00:47:22,529
Look, please...

548
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:32,247
if you know of anything
that could help us,

549
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:34,291
what harm could it do?

550
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:38,837
Only new life
can defeat Death.

551
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,048
What the hell
does that mean?

552
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:45,469
Some people say there's a balance
to everything.

553
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:48,430
For every life
there's a death,

554
00:47:48,514 --> 00:47:50,766
and for every death
there is a life.

555
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:53,602
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

556
00:47:53,685 --> 00:47:56,063
that can
invalidate the list,

557
00:47:56,188 --> 00:47:59,441
force Death
to start anew.

558
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:09,868
You have to follow
the signs...

559
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:11,787
Kimberly.

560
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:16,083
How do you know my name?

561
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:32,307
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.

562
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:35,394
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?

563
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:37,396
Where did you
find that guy?

564
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:39,231
I thought he was supposed
to help us,

565
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:40,732
not freak us out.

566
00:48:45,988 --> 00:48:47,573
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

567
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:52,911
I'm thinking suck on my junk,
bee-atch.

568
00:48:52,995 --> 00:48:54,788
Little punk.

569
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:08,677
What is it?

570
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,138
What did you see?

571
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:26,778
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

572
00:49:26,862 --> 00:49:29,031
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

573
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:31,241
What did you see?!

574
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:36,204
I was driving a white van.

575
00:49:36,288 --> 00:49:38,624
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

576
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:40,542
because I crashed
into a lake.

577
00:49:40,626 --> 00:49:42,753
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

578
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:45,756
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

579
00:49:48,967 --> 00:49:50,719
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

580
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:53,472
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

581
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:56,892
He said only new life
can defeat death.

582
00:49:58,477 --> 00:49:59,936
If she gives birth
to a baby

583
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:01,980
that would've died
in that car crash...

584
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:04,691
a brand new soul that was never part
of Death's design...

585
00:50:04,816 --> 00:50:06,360
It throws the whole list
out of whack

586
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:08,654
and we start over
with a clean slate.

587
00:50:08,737 --> 00:50:11,740
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?

588
00:50:11,823 --> 00:50:13,909
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

589
00:50:13,992 --> 00:50:15,369
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

590
00:50:15,494 --> 00:50:19,623
We have to warn her about the lake
so she can stay alive to have the baby.

591
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:22,834
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

592
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:24,503
There could be thousands
of white vans in the state.

593
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:25,837
Hey!

594
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:28,715
I'm a cop, remember?

595
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:33,762
Wait, that's it.

596
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:38,558
Got it.

597
00:50:40,852 --> 00:50:43,105
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.

598
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:45,273
Here we go.

599
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:47,275
The vehicle
is a delivery van

600
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,778
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

601
00:50:51,029 --> 00:50:53,115
We should pick them up
pretty quickly.

602
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:55,033
Come on, let's get
to the meeting.

603
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:11,633
Hey, hold the door!

604
00:51:13,051 --> 00:51:14,970
Hey, let go of my shoe!

605
00:51:15,053 --> 00:51:16,805
Give me my shoe!

606
00:51:22,811 --> 00:51:25,856
I wrote to management two weeks ago
about these friggin' bumpers.

607
00:51:27,816 --> 00:51:29,985
Is that dogshit, dude?

608
00:51:33,155 --> 00:51:34,906
Eww.

609
00:51:40,162 --> 00:51:42,330
Oh, you got something
on your...

610
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,670
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

611
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:51,715
No, it's alright.

612
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:55,844
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

613
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:01,057
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.

614
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:04,936
What?

615
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:07,981
Hey, man,
how you doing?

616
00:52:08,106 --> 00:52:10,275
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

617
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:13,945
Okay, keep checking.

618
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:25,916
Does anybody have a Valium?

619
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,918
Oh, yeah.

620
00:52:28,043 --> 00:52:29,753
Here.

621
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:32,255
You're just going to want to take
half of that.

622
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,840
Keep 'em coming.

623
00:52:36,635 --> 00:52:38,261
If what you're saying is true,

624
00:52:38,386 --> 00:52:39,930
that means I'm next.

625
00:52:40,055 --> 00:52:42,599
This is crazy, people, come on.

626
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:44,768
First Death
is stalking us,

627
00:52:44,893 --> 00:52:47,228
and now premonitions?
What?

628
00:52:47,312 --> 00:52:48,980
You're not next, Nora.

629
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:52,317
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

630
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,570
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

631
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:57,280
This cannot be happening.

632
00:52:57,405 --> 00:52:59,115
See, because my career
is at a peak

633
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,242
and I finally met
a quality guy.

634
00:53:01,326 --> 00:53:02,911
I just bought a house.

635
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:05,038
Maybe if you shut the fuck up,
you'll live.

636
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:08,458
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

637
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:11,252
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

638
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:12,921
you have a fighting chance.

639
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:16,424
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...

640
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:18,802
Get to a high-rise fast.

641
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:23,932
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

642
00:53:24,015 --> 00:53:25,975
Get it?

643
00:53:28,853 --> 00:53:31,439
Okay, you guys, listen...

644
00:53:31,523 --> 00:53:33,608
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

645
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:35,443
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

646
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:37,278
of seeing signs
to some extent.

647
00:53:37,362 --> 00:53:39,072
Okay, okay, look.

648
00:53:39,197 --> 00:53:40,615
I gotta call bullshit.

649
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:42,450
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

650
00:53:42,534 --> 00:53:44,452
to all your theories
and all your stories,

651
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:46,579
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

652
00:53:46,705 --> 00:53:48,373
Call it what you want!

653
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:51,292
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!

654
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:53,294
Has been all day.

655
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:56,798
There is nobody after us
but you,

656
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:59,092
trying to make us all crazy.

657
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:14,983
I should have seen that coming.

658
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:16,609
Yeah.

659
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:18,945
If Death is out to get you,

660
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,072
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

661
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:23,283
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

662
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:25,410
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

663
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:27,036
Sleep in shifts.

664
00:54:27,162 --> 00:54:29,497
We need to safe-proof
this death-trap.

665
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:41,092
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

666
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:43,178
Are you kidding me?

667
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:46,389
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.

668
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:50,602
Ohh!

669
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:52,937
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

670
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:55,607
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

671
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,276
So, Nora's got
to bite it before me anyhow, huh?

672
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:01,362
Oh, you people have
no sense of humor.

673
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:10,413
Nora, you okay?

674
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:14,709
Four years ago
my husband died.

675
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:17,879
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

676
00:55:17,962 --> 00:55:19,881
Don't say that, okay?

677
00:55:19,964 --> 00:55:22,550
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

678
00:55:22,634 --> 00:55:25,220
with my family,
I can accept that.

679
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:29,057
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

680
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,059
If we just stick
together long enough

681
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:32,727
for her
to have her baby...

682
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:35,271
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

683
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:38,107
Nora.

684
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:42,737
What do you think
you're doing?

685
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,406
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

686
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,408
Look, look.

687
00:55:47,492 --> 00:55:49,535
I control my life, alright?

688
00:55:49,661 --> 00:55:52,538
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.

689
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:55,959
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

690
00:55:56,084 --> 00:55:58,628
Whatever. You may be able
to scare these people,

691
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:01,047
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.

692
00:56:01,172 --> 00:56:02,715
- Hey.
- What?

693
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,927
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

694
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:18,773
I'm just going
to put this in the...

695
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:21,651
closet.

696
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:52,765
Sorry.

697
00:57:09,157 --> 00:57:11,075
Whoa.

698
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:23,087
Man with hooks?

699
00:57:24,255 --> 00:57:26,048
Man with hooks.

700
00:57:26,174 --> 00:57:28,551
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

701
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:31,929
Is that...

702
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:35,308
- a sign?
- Oh my God.

703
00:57:35,433 --> 00:57:37,059
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

704
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:38,561
- The phone.
- Shit.

705
00:57:59,707 --> 00:58:01,584
What the fuck?

706
00:58:12,136 --> 00:58:13,679
- Hello?
- Nora!

707
00:58:13,804 --> 00:58:16,682
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

708
00:58:16,807 --> 00:58:19,477
Officer Burke,
I can't...

709
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,187
I can't hear you!
What?!

710
00:58:21,312 --> 00:58:22,480
What does he...
What?!

711
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:24,690
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

712
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:26,234
- What, what?
- Oh...

713
00:58:26,317 --> 00:58:27,985
What is it, Nora?

714
00:58:30,571 --> 00:58:32,031
No!

715
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:34,408
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

716
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:36,369
Wait, wait, Nora!

717
00:58:36,494 --> 00:58:38,454
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

718
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:39,872
Let me help!

719
00:58:39,997 --> 00:58:41,332
Let me go!

720
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:50,883
Let go of me!

721
00:58:57,848 --> 00:58:59,725
Kat!

722
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:12,822
Help me!

723
00:59:12,947 --> 00:59:15,491
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

724
00:59:28,295 --> 00:59:30,214
Aah!
Let me out of here.

725
00:59:32,383 --> 00:59:34,385
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

726
00:59:34,468 --> 00:59:37,388
Isabella's being held at
the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.

727
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:39,724
I'm in control of my life!

728
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:42,059
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?

729
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:44,103
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

730
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:46,897
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.

731
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:49,316
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

732
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,278
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

733
00:59:52,403 --> 00:59:54,822
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

734
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:56,949
Alright, give me
the gun, Eugene.

735
00:59:57,074 --> 00:59:59,243
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

736
00:59:59,326 --> 01:00:02,413
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

737
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:04,540
You just got
to calm down, man.

738
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:06,459
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

739
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:09,462
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

740
01:00:09,587 --> 01:00:11,630
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

741
01:00:11,756 --> 01:00:14,425
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

742
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:16,343
You hear me!

743
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:19,388
God!

744
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:30,191
Oh!

745
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:31,692
You don't keep it loaded?

746
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:35,863
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

747
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:39,116
Never.
That's impossible.

748
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,494
It wasn't his turn to die.

749
01:00:43,037 --> 01:00:45,706
Can we find
the pregnant woman, now, please?

750
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:54,882
Is this safe, guys?

751
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:57,426
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

752
01:00:57,551 --> 01:00:59,970
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

753
01:01:00,054 --> 01:01:01,931
Or her?

754
01:01:03,307 --> 01:01:04,934
Hopefully her.

755
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:08,062
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

756
01:01:08,145 --> 01:01:10,773
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

757
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:14,235
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

758
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:17,154
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

759
01:01:24,828 --> 01:01:26,372
Look at me.

760
01:01:26,497 --> 01:01:28,457
Come on.

761
01:01:28,582 --> 01:01:30,584
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

762
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:33,087
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

763
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,089
Look, hopefully
the district judge

764
01:01:35,172 --> 01:01:38,092
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

765
01:01:44,682 --> 01:01:46,600
Marcus.

766
01:01:46,684 --> 01:01:49,270
Marcus, Marcus.

767
01:01:49,353 --> 01:01:51,605
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...

768
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:56,568
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

769
01:01:56,694 --> 01:01:58,612
My water just broke.

770
01:01:58,696 --> 01:02:00,614
- What?
- My water, it just broke.

771
01:02:00,698 --> 01:02:03,409
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

772
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:06,412
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

773
01:02:06,537 --> 01:02:09,581
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

774
01:02:09,707 --> 01:02:12,918
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

775
01:02:13,043 --> 01:02:14,670
Get me to the hospital!

776
01:02:14,795 --> 01:02:16,630
Okay, okay!

777
01:02:16,714 --> 01:02:19,800
Sheriff Perry,
this is Deputy Adams, come back.

778
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:23,679
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

779
01:02:23,804 --> 01:02:25,973
My van! My van!
Take my van!

780
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:29,935
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,104
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

782
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:34,148
Yeah, we'll go.

783
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:39,570
Come on,
come on!

784
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:46,827
Y'all want to hear
something crazy?

785
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,996
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.

786
01:02:51,498 --> 01:02:54,460
A kid came to school
with a knife...

787
01:02:54,585 --> 01:02:56,336
killed his teacher.

788
01:02:58,172 --> 01:03:00,299
Teacher would have
been me,

789
01:03:00,424 --> 01:03:04,053
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

790
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:06,263
That's fucking weird, man.

791
01:03:06,346 --> 01:03:07,681
You want weird?

792
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:09,850
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

793
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:12,019
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

794
01:03:12,102 --> 01:03:14,354
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

795
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,567
He died that night
in a shootout.

796
01:03:19,777 --> 01:03:22,905
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

797
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,698
I'd be dead, too.

798
01:03:24,782 --> 01:03:26,909
Oh my God.

799
01:03:27,034 --> 01:03:28,911
I'm sorry.

800
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:30,621
It's just I got one, too.

801
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:32,831
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay

802
01:03:32,956 --> 01:03:35,626
at this cheesy little
bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

803
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:38,587
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak
that no one knows about,

804
01:03:38,712 --> 01:03:41,089
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

805
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:42,466
So what happened?

806
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:44,134
I don't know.
I never made it.

807
01:03:44,218 --> 01:03:46,929
The bus I was on splattered
some girl all over the road.

808
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:48,430
Was that in Mt Abraham?

809
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:51,934
Yes. How did you know?

810
01:03:52,059 --> 01:03:54,645
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.

811
01:03:56,063 --> 01:03:58,315
She was supposed to die
on Flight 180.

812
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:04,238
Hey, do you guys remember
that theatre in Paris

813
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:07,115
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

814
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:11,245
Well, I had tickets to go.

815
01:04:11,328 --> 01:04:13,747
But one night I'm in Paris

816
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:17,084
and I'm just
tripping on acid

817
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:19,419
and sipping lattes and such.

818
01:04:19,503 --> 01:04:21,338
And then all of a sudden

819
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:24,591
this dude out of nowhere

820
01:04:24,675 --> 01:04:27,094
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

821
01:04:27,177 --> 01:04:29,930
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

822
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:32,599
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

823
01:04:32,683 --> 01:04:35,602
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

824
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:38,605
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

825
01:04:38,689 --> 01:04:40,274
that saved my life...

826
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:42,776
that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

827
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:45,320
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

828
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:48,824
The people who got off
of Flight 180.

829
01:04:50,534 --> 01:04:52,661
They were my friends.

830
01:04:56,123 --> 01:04:58,417
Kimberly,
tell us what happened.

831
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:04,715
About a year ago my mum and I
were at the mall.

832
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:06,717
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

833
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,386
but I got caught up watching
this news report

834
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:11,346
about some kid
that committed suicide.

835
01:05:12,806 --> 01:05:14,558
I kept thinking,

836
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:17,019
'How can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

837
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:18,937
That's stupid.'

838
01:05:21,648 --> 01:05:23,567
It felt wrong.

839
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:25,444
And yet...

840
01:05:28,488 --> 01:05:31,742
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

841
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:36,413
Some kids were trying
to steal my mum's car.

842
01:05:36,496 --> 01:05:39,082
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

843
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,251
and they killed her.

844
01:05:42,836 --> 01:05:46,465
After the funeral I kept thinking that
it should have been me.

845
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:49,968
I guess everyone must
think that.

846
01:05:51,595 --> 01:05:53,638
But I guess I was right.

847
01:06:02,773 --> 01:06:05,859
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!

848
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,694
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

849
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:12,032
When we got off
Flight 180,

850
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:15,035
it didn't just change
our lives.

851
01:06:15,118 --> 01:06:17,537
It affected everyone
and everything

852
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:19,873
we've come
into contact with since.

853
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:21,875
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

854
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:24,377
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

855
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:26,546
it caused an outward ripple.

856
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,507
A rift in Death's design.

857
01:06:28,632 --> 01:06:31,593
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

858
01:06:33,136 --> 01:06:35,222
we wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

859
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:37,849
Yes, that's why Death
is working backwards!

860
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:40,060
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

861
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:42,437
Sealing the rift once
and for all.

862
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:05,836
Oh, shit!

863
01:07:07,921 --> 01:07:09,548
Jesus Christ!

864
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:14,135
Hang on! Hang on!

865
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:36,616
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.

866
01:07:38,952 --> 01:07:40,662
God, Eugene!

867
01:07:40,787 --> 01:07:43,873
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

868
01:07:46,793 --> 01:07:48,420
No, please.

869
01:07:48,545 --> 01:07:51,298
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

870
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:53,592
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

871
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:58,013
Those people can help.
Let's go.

872
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:02,017
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

873
01:08:02,142 --> 01:08:04,185
off 9-A
at the 180 mile-marker.

874
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:06,104
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

875
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:09,232
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

876
01:08:09,316 --> 01:08:11,985
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

877
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:16,656
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

878
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,950
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

879
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:21,578
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

880
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,002
Stay with us.

881
01:08:29,085 --> 01:08:30,462
Hey, hey you!

882
01:08:30,587 --> 01:08:34,549
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

883
01:08:34,674 --> 01:08:38,219
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

884
01:08:41,014 --> 01:08:42,515
I think it's okay.

885
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:44,893
I don't smell any gas
and nothing's dripping.

886
01:08:45,018 --> 01:08:47,729
Alright, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.

887
01:08:47,854 --> 01:08:49,939
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?

888
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:54,402
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

889
01:08:54,527 --> 01:08:56,738
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

890
01:08:56,863 --> 01:08:58,907
I'm so... Dad!

891
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:06,706
Eugene, everything's
going to be okay.

892
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:09,542
If he doesn't get a respirator,
he's not going to make it!

893
01:09:09,626 --> 01:09:12,545
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!

894
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:16,091
Check the gauges on the regulator,
and watch out for overdoses!

895
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:19,260
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.

896
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,181
And watch out
for power lines!

897
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:26,601
Watch it!

898
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:34,567
You trying to get yourself killed,
little boy?

899
01:09:34,651 --> 01:09:36,945
You got to use
your head, man.

900
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,738
Get that news van back.

901
01:09:38,822 --> 01:09:40,406
Thanks.

902
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:49,791
Okay, let's go.

903
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:08,476
How is she doing?

904
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:10,645
I think she's going
to be okay.

905
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:16,192
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

906
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:20,113
When I die...

907
01:10:20,196 --> 01:10:21,990
is it going to hurt?

908
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:25,326
I don't know.

909
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:28,663
You're going to die after me, right?

910
01:10:29,873 --> 01:10:31,666
Yeah, I guess so.

911
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,670
Would you take these?

912
01:10:41,551 --> 01:10:43,428
And if I die...

913
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:47,974
would you throw out
all my drugs

914
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:52,020
and my paraphernalia
and my porno?

915
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:55,982
You know...

916
01:10:56,065 --> 01:10:58,526
anything that's going
to break my mum's heart.

917
01:10:59,736 --> 01:11:01,446
Please?

918
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:06,451
Thank you.

919
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,582
This is Cheyenne Jacobson

920
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:14,584
reporting live
from the Gibbons farm.

921
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:16,419
Sheriff Perry,
Officer Burke here.

922
01:11:16,544 --> 01:11:19,088
I'm trying to get some
information on Isabella...

923
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:21,090
She did?

924
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:23,760
Okay. Thanks.
Great.

925
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:25,303
Kimberly!

926
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:28,014
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

927
01:11:28,097 --> 01:11:30,016
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?

928
01:11:30,141 --> 01:11:31,351
I'll go talk to her.

929
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:34,270
Hi.

930
01:11:34,354 --> 01:11:36,898
Just find Isabella and get this thing
over with, okay?

931
01:11:37,023 --> 01:11:38,733
Go on, I'll be fine.

932
01:11:45,698 --> 01:11:47,658
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.

933
01:11:51,788 --> 01:11:54,582
Could you be a little quieter
with that thing, please?

934
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:57,543
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.

935
01:11:57,627 --> 01:11:59,003
That would be good.

936
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,282
Rory.

937
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,634
Oh my God!

938
01:12:46,759 --> 01:12:48,719
Somebody get out there!

939
01:12:48,845 --> 01:12:51,764
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!

940
01:12:51,848 --> 01:12:53,307
The keys are in it.

941
01:12:57,186 --> 01:12:59,480
Kimberly!

942
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,034
Kimberly!

943
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:14,245
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?

944
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,789
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.

945
01:13:18,624 --> 01:13:20,585
This one was different.

946
01:13:20,668 --> 01:13:23,629
It was like the van crashing
into the lake.

947
01:13:23,754 --> 01:13:25,756
I was in a hospital,
there was screaming

948
01:13:25,882 --> 01:13:27,550
and a nurse was trying
to choke me.

949
01:13:27,633 --> 01:13:30,219
I couldn't see her,
but I could see her name tag.

950
01:13:30,303 --> 01:13:32,263
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.

951
01:13:33,973 --> 01:13:37,184
I think a nurse named
Kalarjian is going to try and kill Isabella.

952
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:44,108
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!

953
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:45,693
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?

954
01:13:45,818 --> 01:13:48,154
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

955
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:51,115
A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,

956
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,035
one of them killed
by a safety device meant to protect us.

957
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,579
Ironically, the woman
was impaled through the head

958
01:13:56,662 --> 01:13:58,998
after her emergency airbag
deployed.

959
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:02,668
She was trapped in her vehicle after it
crashed into a field near Greenwood Lake.

960
01:14:02,752 --> 01:14:05,171
Suddenly the airbag went off...

961
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:41,707
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

962
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,876
We may need to do
a stat Caesarean!

963
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:45,795
Get Dr. Kalarjian
up here now!

964
01:14:45,878 --> 01:14:48,547
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

965
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:50,049
I'm just going
to wait outside,

966
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:52,093
'cause I'm just really
in the way here.

967
01:14:52,218 --> 01:14:54,095
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.

968
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,930
You guys, get to Isabella!

969
01:14:56,055 --> 01:14:57,807
I'm going to find Eugene!

970
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:01,060
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

971
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:04,105
Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.

972
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:22,123
Dr. Kalarjian,
in here, hurry!

973
01:15:23,332 --> 01:15:25,418
That's her.

974
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,045
Wait, wait, wait!

975
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:07,626
Contractions have stopped.

976
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,212
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

977
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:12,381
Bad tracing,
it's losing oxygen.

978
01:16:12,464 --> 01:16:14,550
The cord's compressed!

979
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:17,928
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!

980
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:19,722
Where's Kalarjian?!

981
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:22,474
Dr. Kalarjian!

982
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,727
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.

983
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:28,022
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.

984
01:16:37,323 --> 01:16:39,867
Just push a little more.

985
01:16:39,992 --> 01:16:42,286
Oh, no.

986
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:44,121
Isabella, is the baby okay?

987
01:16:45,331 --> 01:16:46,916
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

988
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:49,585
- I have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know...

989
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:52,546
I need to know if the baby's alright!

990
01:16:54,173 --> 01:16:55,966
It's a boy.

991
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:18,697
Thank you.
Congratulations!

992
01:17:18,781 --> 01:17:20,741
Who the hell are they?

993
01:17:20,866 --> 01:17:23,202
Oh my God!

994
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:28,749
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.

995
01:17:28,832 --> 01:17:31,543
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.

996
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:33,587
It's over.
It's okay.

997
01:17:47,101 --> 01:17:49,520
- Kimberly.
- What did you see?

998
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:52,898
I don't think Isabella
was ever supposed to die in that pileup.

999
01:17:52,981 --> 01:17:55,317
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to mean?

1000
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:57,236
Try to remember.

1001
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:17,881
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.

1002
01:18:18,924 --> 01:18:20,342
Eugene.

1003
01:18:24,847 --> 01:18:27,891
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?

1004
01:18:28,016 --> 01:18:29,768
You saw an ECG machine
and what else?

1005
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,939
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

1006
01:18:35,023 --> 01:18:36,442
Wait.

1007
01:18:38,444 --> 01:18:40,237
Eugene.

1008
01:19:00,382 --> 01:19:02,301
Oh God, no!

1009
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:14,271
Bloody hands.

1010
01:19:16,064 --> 01:19:18,192
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.

1011
01:19:18,317 --> 01:19:20,360
- What?
- Crash cart.

1012
01:19:20,444 --> 01:19:21,904
Let's go! Move it!

1013
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,158
Dr. Kalarjian.

1014
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:28,035
ECG machine.

1015
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:34,208
The lake.

1016
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,168
The white van.

1017
01:19:40,923 --> 01:19:42,758
What are you talking about?

1018
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:47,262
New life.

1019
01:19:49,848 --> 01:19:51,558
What is it?

1020
01:19:51,683 --> 01:19:53,936
I know what I have
to do to save us.

1021
01:19:55,437 --> 01:19:58,398
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.

1022
01:19:58,482 --> 01:20:01,610
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

1023
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:08,283
Get Kalarjian.

1024
01:22:33,803 --> 01:22:36,890
Only new life can defeat death.

1025
01:22:36,973 --> 01:22:39,726
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

1026
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:42,145
with my family.
I can accept that.

1027
01:22:43,772 --> 01:22:45,440
Flight 180...

1028
01:22:45,523 --> 01:22:47,776
I know what I have to do
to save us.

1029
01:22:47,901 --> 01:22:49,945
There are no known survivors.

1030
01:22:50,028 --> 01:22:51,988
I have to die.

1031
01:22:53,573 --> 01:22:56,243
Ready and clear!

1032
01:22:57,285 --> 01:22:58,328
Nothing!

1033
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:03,416
Ready and clear.

1034
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,753
Nothing.

1035
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:10,548
- Come on.
- Ready, clear.

1036
01:23:10,632 --> 01:23:13,677
She's back!

1037
01:23:13,802 --> 01:23:16,054
Epinephrine.
Two milligrams, IV push.

1038
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:18,974
I want her prepped
and stabilized for ICU.

1039
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:24,771
Welcome back.

1040
01:23:25,939 --> 01:23:28,024
They lost you
for a minute there.

1041
01:23:34,155 --> 01:23:37,367
Hey. We did it.

1042
01:23:38,451 --> 01:23:40,453
Thanks to you,
we cheated Death.

1043
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:14,654
Would you like some wine?

1044
01:24:14,779 --> 01:24:16,865
I think I'll stick
to our beer, thanks.

1045
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,283
Alright.

1046
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:20,785
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.

1047
01:24:20,869 --> 01:24:23,038
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

1048
01:24:23,121 --> 01:24:25,039
It's our pleasure.

1049
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:29,711
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.

1050
01:24:29,794 --> 01:24:31,963
I had a fun summer.

1051
01:24:32,046 --> 01:24:35,341
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

1052
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:41,139
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

1053
01:24:41,222 --> 01:24:43,850
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.

1054
01:24:43,975 --> 01:24:46,144
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.

1055
01:24:46,227 --> 01:24:49,272
Yeah, me too. Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

1056
01:24:49,355 --> 01:24:51,107
What's that?

1057
01:24:51,232 --> 01:24:54,444
Brian was almost hit by that
news van that day in the field.

1058
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:57,197
And your friend Rory,
he pulled him back at the last second.

1059
01:24:57,322 --> 01:25:00,784
- Saved his life.
- You never told me that, Peter.

1060
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:02,410
Boy, that was lucky.

1061
01:25:07,248 --> 01:25:09,584
Brian!

1062
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:19,427
# I'm right behind you #

1063
01:25:19,552 --> 01:25:21,763
# Here I come #

1064
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:28,353
# Let me remind you #

1065
01:25:28,478 --> 01:25:31,064
# You're on the run #

1066
01:25:34,734 --> 01:25:39,364
# My name is Death #

1067
01:25:39,447 --> 01:25:45,286
# Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath #

1068
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:51,501
# All lights are diamonds #

1069
01:25:51,626 --> 01:25:55,547
# Behind dark glass #

1070
01:25:57,966 --> 01:26:01,261
# She leans toward me #

1071
01:26:01,344 --> 01:26:04,597
# A forward pass #

1072
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,061
# In the blood,
come-a, come-a cow cud #

1073
01:26:10,186 --> 01:26:12,272
# Nobody really cares
about you now, bud #

1074
01:26:12,397 --> 01:26:14,774
# Pay the price, roll the dice
run the maze like-a mice #

1075
01:26:14,857 --> 01:26:17,068
# Ashes ever turn to dust
for the two of us #

1076
01:26:17,151 --> 01:26:21,239
# My name is Death #

1077
01:26:21,322 --> 01:26:26,452
# Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath #

1078
01:26:26,577 --> 01:26:31,207
# My name is Death #

1079
01:26:31,332 --> 01:26:35,336
# Come taste, come taste #

1080
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:38,256
# Come to the party #

1081
01:26:38,339 --> 01:26:41,384
# The price is free #

1082
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:51,144
# You seem to persist
hanging on the fount beauty #

1083
01:26:54,188 --> 01:26:59,110
# My name is Death #

1084
01:26:59,193 --> 01:27:03,781
# Come taste my
peppermint-laced breath #

1085
01:27:03,865 --> 01:27:08,453
# My name is Death #

1086
01:27:08,578 --> 01:27:10,621
# Come taste my #

1087
01:27:10,705 --> 01:27:12,957
# Peppermint-laced #

1088
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:16,586
# My name is... #

1089
01:27:17,879 --> 01:27:20,339
# Death. #
