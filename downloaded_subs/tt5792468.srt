00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:46,009
My name is Sophia Crane.
It's March 3rd, 2004.

3
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:49,211
I'm a film student
and this is my senior thesis.

4
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,714
I don't know how much longer
I'm going to be alive,

5
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:53,683
so I ask whoever find this,

6
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,351
please apply the first
and second halves

7
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:58,890
of this final interview to the
beginning and end of my film.

8
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:01,958
I don't know where to
make the cut.

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
This is the story of Peeping Tom

10
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:05,965
and how I went looking for him.

11
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:09,734
Please show this to my parents.

12
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:14,336
I don't know how much longer
I can go without blinking.

13
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:20,680
Morning, fellas. Come on in.

14
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,979
So, this is the house
I was telling you about.

15
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,817
This is my in-laws' house.

16
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:33,823
The information that we have on it, it
seems to have been built around 1970-75,

17
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,726
I can't really find
any information other than that,

18
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:40,665
but down here in the basement

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,401
is where Bart found it.

20
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:47,936
I'll turn the light on.
Now, I have repositioned it

21
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,707
for presentation purposes so,
if you'll bear with me...

22
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,978
Here, just going to go
and dig it out.

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,216
Right now if you can see me,
it was right under here.

24
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:05,224
It was this... box. Come over
here, I'll show it to you.

25
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,393
Don't watch, huh.

26
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:16,131
Pretty eerie, but isn't that how
all good horror movies start?

27
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,938
A little mystery,
a little riddle.

28
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,941
Well, my husband recently
retired,

29
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:28,344
we find this beautiful
house that we both loved

30
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:32,347
and I guess it was
just before Thanksgiving.

31
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,719
My husband went down in the basement,
did what guys do, you know,

32
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:39,788
check the boiler, check the air conditioning,
play with the filters, things like that.

33
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,860
He found this box full of tapes.

34
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:48,064
She thought that Gavin could use
them for work,

35
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:52,469
because he does
wedding videos and

36
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:56,439
she thought maybe he can tape over them,
or something, like to save money,

37
00:02:56,441 --> 00:03:00,410
but there are mini DVs so we
don't really use them anymore.

38
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:05,084
You know, I thought maybe Gavin can take
a look at them, see what's on them,

39
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,290
something as like a little project to keep
him interested and excited about film.

40
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:17,427
And the very first one that I
picked up says:

41
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,129
Final Solution.

42
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,096
Alright,
that's the first one I watched,

43
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:23,968
I mean, how could you not watch
anything like that, right?

44
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:29,873
<i>So what happened on the tape</i>
Final Solution, <i>what did you see?</i>

45
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:35,210
A young lady identifies herself
as Sophia Crane, a film student.

46
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:38,381
Total coincidence, as a film
major, film major,

47
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:41,854
so already we're <i>simpatico,</i>
which is great.

48
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:46,523
She's upset about the school project,
she's stressed out a little bit,

49
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:50,393
and then it got a little upsetting
after that and a little bit weird.

50
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,996
Some violence, some things that I
don't really wanna say right now,

51
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,098
we don't what to give it
all away.

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,000
But let's just say
that I had to watch

53
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:01,203
about the next 40 tapes
immediately after that.

54
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:06,008
First thing I did was, of course, call the
previous owner that we bought the house from,

55
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,012
left voicemail messages saying
that I found a box,

56
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,880
found something that probably
belongs to them.

57
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,548
I never heard back from them,

58
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,485
and then eventually the phone
number was just unlisted.

59
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:20,957
<i>But the footage never actually
takes place in your in-laws' house.</i>

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,596
No, it doesn't, and that's another kind of
fun, clinky dink about this whole thing.

61
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:30,168
<i>What are you doing in
regards to the home?</i>

62
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,870
Selling it.

63
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,538
After the first tape,

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,440
the next tape that I saw there
was called <i>Rough Edit.</i>

65
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:41,444
Everything looks really good, there
is interviews on the street,

66
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:46,916
really nice flow, and then after about
ten minutes it gets really choppy.

67
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,319
And it's about 40 or so tapes
in here,

68
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:52,322
so it's like they got too busy to
cut it together and they just kept

69
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:55,895
filming and filming and filming and
they didn't really know when to stop.

70
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:02,130
- <i>So what did you do?</i>
- Well, being a good filmmaker

71
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:05,468
as I am, I took their film
and I finished it.

72
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,173
I edited it together myself,
I took their film

73
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,474
and made it my film,
so now it's finished,

74
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,480
now it's completed the way that
it should have been.

75
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,949
<i>And what did you think
when you saw it all in sequence?</i>

76
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:27,190
Well, I didn't really sleep

77
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:30,862
for a couple of days after that.

78
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:47,980
Behind me stands the Ilchester tunnel,
home to the B&O... Shit, again.

79
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,081
Are we rolling?

80
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,452
Well, I mean, to me it
looks it...

81
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:14,036
Behind me stands the Ilchester tunnel, a thruway
for the B&O Railroad for over a century.

82
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,074
But for the past 80 years, for local residents,
it has become something far more sinister.

83
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,409
It's become home to...

84
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:22,411
- Peeping Tom.
- Peeping Tom.

85
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:25,315
- The Blink Man.
- Mr. Blink.

86
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,149
- Peeping Tom.
- Peeping Tom.

87
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:29,485
- The Blink Man.
- The Ilchester The Molester.

88
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:30,687
The Tunnel Guy?

89
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,555
- Peeping Tom.
- Old Blinky.

90
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,389
Alright, so you guys
have ever seen him before?

91
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,291
Unless I'm a ghost right now,
then no!

92
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:38,428
If I saw him, I'd be dead.

93
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,197
Yes, I did know this one fellow
around my age,

94
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,601
this is back around 64-65 or so,
he saw The Blink Man.

95
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:50,173
- What happened to him?
- Well, he died.

96
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:53,743
Peeping Tom is the kind of
creature that you can summon up,

97
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:58,348
so there is a ritual, those teen pilgrimages,
you know, the midnight road trip,

98
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,317
you show up at the trestle end
of the tunnel at midnight

99
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,423
and you have to stare down this tunnel,
looking at the end for a full hour.

100
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,726
And if you can do this
without blinking,

101
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:14,663
Peeping Tom comes out of the shadows
and materializes in front of you.

102
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:19,267
Now he's the class of supernatural
creature called a <i>Flimmern-Geist</i>.

103
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,738
German alchemists came up
with this term in the 1500s

104
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,375
for that thing, that you see in
the corner of your eyes

105
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:30,346
and when you look around to see
it, there's nothing there.

106
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,180
Peeping Tom is
a <i>Flimmern-Geist</i>

107
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:35,084
that you can actually
bring into view.

108
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,753
- Well, he's tall, dark coat.
- Skinny.

109
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,454
- Top hat.
- Big scary eyes.

110
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:41,324
Mostly I've heard that
he's just a shadow,

111
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:44,293
'cause he's like in your
peripheral vision.

112
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:46,529
Instantly there, then not there,
then there again.

113
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,731
There was this one chick,
in particular,

114
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,500
a few years ago, she went to the
school right down the road.

115
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:54,370
Her and her friends
went up to the tunnel rail

116
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:59,108
and they started staring down, she was the only
one who could stare for... you have to stare

117
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,243
- for an hour.
- For an hour.

118
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,110
The twist is that

119
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:05,281
once you've seen him,
you can't unsee him.

120
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:09,351
Every time you blink,
he's a little bit closer

121
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:14,423
and he comes closer and closer each time
you blink until he's right in your face.

122
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,659
He sounds scary,
what does he do?

123
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,094
- Gets you.
- Gets you.

124
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,228
And now you've already proved

125
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,562
that you can keep your eyes open

126
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,164
for a long time,

127
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,699
because that's
how you conjure him up.

128
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,401
When he's right up there,

129
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,402
the temptation is death
staring you in the face,

130
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:29,337
you do anything
you can to avoid him.

131
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,139
But he's got a trick up his
sleeve,

132
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,574
he has very long eyelashes

133
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:35,143
and you know that thing that you
do with babies,

134
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,213
to give them a little,
he does that,

135
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:41,349
and then you can't help it, you blink.
What do we call that...

136
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:43,419
Can I show it, like...
Butterfly...

137
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,555
...butterfly kisses.

138
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,623
I'm pretty sure there's only,
I don't know,

139
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,426
a couple of people in the world,
period,

140
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:54,229
that can stare for an hour
straight.

141
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:57,733
I think the world record, I don't even
know if the world record is an hour.

142
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:03,305
I think the record is probably
maybe 30 minutes, 40 minutes.

143
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:05,407
It's really hard to stare at
something without blinking

144
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:09,277
for even 10 or 15 minutes. It will
be really difficult for most people.

145
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,682
Well, of course, there's no record of it.
People too busy dying to report it.

146
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:18,186
Even if you made it out to that long, I mean
the vision will be quite blurred and, again,

147
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:21,357
you know, I can't emphasize enough,
the pain would be excruciating.

148
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:26,462
As with all the best folklore
and urban legends,

149
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:30,266
you can't really verify
any of the details in this.

150
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,368
It's always happened
to a friend of a friend.

151
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,473
My brother's friend used to tell
the story that his uncle told him.

152
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,575
And they got freaked out
after a while and they ran away

153
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:42,744
but she did stay there
the whole hour.

154
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:45,348
Like a month later
they found his body

155
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,315
floating in the Patapsco River.

156
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:48,884
She ended up trying
to look out a window,

157
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,652
she tried to
burn out her eyes...

158
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,488
By looking at the sun.

159
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,290
Even though she couldn't
see him,

160
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,892
his presence was still there

161
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,361
so she, you know, she thought
the whole time, she gets blinks,

162
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,695
she ended up blinking,
but she...

163
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,664
Can she beat Peeping Tom?

164
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,536
- Can't cheat, though.
- Can't cheat Peeping Tom.

165
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,403
You know, I think you'd be
pushing the limits, I think,

166
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:10,739
of the human anatomy and
physiology,

167
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,242
but maybe that's possible.

168
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,776
Obviously,
from he shared with me,

169
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:17,582
that would be a terrible idea,
if that's for real.

170
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,815
<i>Absence of proof hasn't
caused absence of belief.</i>

171
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:23,752
<i>Ilchester tunnel is still a late
night hang out for teenagers</i>

172
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:26,254
<i>and a popular spot for
fraternity hazing.</i>

173
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:31,662
<i>It's a dare often attempted, but
apparently seldom completed. Until now.</i>

174
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,531
<i>You show up at the trestle
end of the tunnel at midnight...</i>

175
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,733
The metadata on the
tapes

176
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:41,671
show that it was filmed between
February 14th

177
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:45,241
and March 3rd of 2004.

178
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:50,378
OK, so I went back and I looked
at all of the local colleges,

179
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,617
I called, I walked into every
college in town,

180
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:58,554
showed them pictures of Sophia,
showed them pictures of Feldman.

181
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:01,958
No information. You can't get
past these people at all.

182
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,896
There's no record of a doctor Wolfe
who's supposedly their professor,

183
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:12,401
there's no indication that the Peeping
Tom specialist that Sophia and Feldman

184
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,305
go and speak to
in his home even exists,

185
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:20,709
an Asian American man, I believe he's
supposed to be an eye specialist.

186
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:24,347
There's no title cards to show
that this person even exists.

187
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:29,719
<i>I</i> analyzed them, and I
watched them repeatedly, I looked back on

188
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:33,656
every incident reported I could
find that would have matched

189
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:38,460
any of these people, and I can't
find anything that matches up.

190
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:42,797
My hunch would say he probably
found either some student films

191
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,736
or just somebody making her own
horror movie or something like that.

192
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:51,339
There's no cuts, there's no retakes,
there's no calling for action,

193
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,443
aside from the first two
minutes of the movie,

194
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:58,917
where Sophia is obviously
directing herself,

195
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:04,489
there's absolutely no evidence to suggest
that somebody is directing them.

196
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:10,358
I've been staring at it for the
better part of six months right now.

197
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,628
<i>I believe it's 100% genuine.</i>

198
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,031
<i>It looks like
found footage.</i>

199
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,364
- <i>Movie.</i>
- Alright.

200
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,033
Found footage, I mean,

201
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,969
what does that really mean?

202
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,804
Did I find the footage?

203
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:24,339
Was it handed to me and then am
I presenting it again? Yes.

204
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,907
That would be considered
found footage,

205
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,877
but as far as putting
a horror movie together,

206
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,378
I don't really think
that there's any...

207
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,814
I'm a, I'm a real filmmaker.

208
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,916
OK, so we're not gonna
be making horror movies.

209
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:37,652
We're gonna try
to reveal the truth of something

210
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:41,525
that's a mystery or
kind of get something out of it.

211
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:45,761
When you make a film that
is presenting itself

212
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:48,763
as roughly cut together
found footage,

213
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:52,734
you are building in your excuse for
anything that's wrong with it.

214
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:57,506
Uh, hey folks, this is the footage we
found, we're just presenting it, yeah.

215
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:01,410
The camera jiggles all over the place,
not because we didn't know how to hold

216
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:05,480
a hand-held camera steady, but because
these were kids lost in the woods

217
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,483
getting more and more scared
all the time.

218
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,785
I think what would make it more
real,

219
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:12,821
would be if it were
the first one out there

220
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:15,557
and they were not following
a certain genre.

221
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,826
It works on a low-budget level

222
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:20,698
and that's the primary reason
for, I think, for doing it.

223
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:25,901
So my hunch is
either Mr. York was doing that himself

224
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:29,037
and trying to get some credence to
this and make it look legitimate,

225
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:35,643
or he just run somebody else's
project and they send it through.

226
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:40,449
<i>Just so we're all clear, the
reason that he can't find the students,</i>

227
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,417
<i>the teachers, the eye doctor...</i>

228
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,719
I believe they're actors.

229
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,623
<i>You realize that the first thing
that critics will accuse you of,</i>

230
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,657
<i>after gullibility,
is faking the film yourself.</i>

231
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,796
Of course, of course, and that's
why nobody would believe this.

232
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,664
<i>Because it's a pretty
big coincidence</i>

233
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,432
<i>that the person who finds the
unfinished film</i>

234
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:58,901
<i>just happens to be a filmmaker.</i>

235
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,536
Right, sure, and the naysayers
are gonna say that

236
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:03,607
because that's what they do,
they naysay.

237
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:09,778
Hum, I don't know if it's real or
not, but it doesn't really matter,

238
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,647
because he's excited about it
being real, so...

239
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:18,921
We're gonna take this footage to every
professional in town that we can find,

240
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:23,792
ghosthunters, mythbusters, we're
going to go to the radio stations,

241
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:29,898
we're going to the TV stations, we're going
to show the footage and we're gonna saturate

242
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,167
the market with this
information.

243
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:36,638
<i>If your plan is to try to
present this as being 100% authentic,</i>

244
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,042
<i>why are you not simply taking the footage forward
and calling a press conference right now?</i>

245
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:46,549
<i>Why are you planning to have the video cleaned
up, why are you looking to have the sound done?</i>

246
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:52,054
Well, I mean, you know, we need to present the
best possible version of this thing as we can,

247
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:56,995
then we're gonna prove to the
world that Peeping Tom exists.

248
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,766
The camera doesn't lie.

249
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:11,675
Mel Sumner, 19, PolySci major
and staring contest champion.

250
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,810
Alright, dude, so right down
there is Ilchester tunnel

251
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,079
and we're gonna have you
standing right over there

252
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:20,682
on the other of the trestle,
starting at 12 for an hour.

253
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:22,818
Well, how the hell am I supposed
to see at the end of that?

254
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,186
Y'all,
just don't worry about it.

255
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:27,623
- You ready?
- Yes, let's stare at it.

256
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:33,932
Alright, ten seconds
to midnight starting... now.

257
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:39,167
- What's it feels like?
- It's so hypnotic!

258
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:42,537
You literally, you can't
really see anything down there.

259
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,707
I can see.

260
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:49,714
That's so creepy, it's like the
tunnel's like staring right back at me.

261
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:54,916
This is kind of like the ultimate
staring contest, you know, like...

262
00:15:54,918 --> 00:16:00,024
even if I win, I can never
really blink again.

263
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:03,057
How much,
how much time we're at?

264
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,261
- Come on, dude!
- You got it, man!

265
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:06,862
Please stop talking to me.

266
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,567
- Sophia, shut up.
- Stop talking.

267
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,072
You're alright?

268
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,076
Fuck! Oh, God!

269
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,215
Why do you want Handycam?

270
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:29,685
We're using our good
camera to document this,

271
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,156
I wanna be able
to document that, OK?

272
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,324
You realize the footage will come
nowhere close to matching up, right?

273
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:39,663
It's documentary,
dude, it doesn't have to match.

274
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,031
I'm gonna ignore that
you just said that.

275
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:48,304
So, what we're doing now
is we set up this camera,

276
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,672
I'm gonna
shoot it down the tunnel

277
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,041
starting right at midnight, it's
gonna go all the way to 1:00 a.m.

278
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,611
- Yeah.
- Now this will take the place

279
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,647
of a human eye
and it will not blink,

280
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,050
it will constantly run and
hopefully right at 1:00 a.m.,

281
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:06,525
as the legend says,
Peeping Tom will show up

282
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:09,892
and butterfly kiss my camera.

283
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,826
Look, as much as
I hate to say this

284
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,696
I think this actually has a
really good shot of working

285
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,797
before you let this go
to your head

286
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,232
simply because a lens is
like an eye, OK?

287
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:23,238
- The shutter, we're good, OK?
- The shutter?

288
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,074
Yes, I think the
shutter. Well, technically...

289
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:28,076
That's the only part
of the camera...

290
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,582
Technically, that would
be blinking. The what?

291
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,787
Alright, man,
we're coming up on it.

292
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,757
- What's the time?
- You ready?

293
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,225
What's the time?

294
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,325
We've got ten more seconds

295
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,362
starting now.

296
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:48,396
Ten, nine...

297
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,699
Come on, Mr. Blink,
See anything?

298
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,837
- No, nothing.
- Come on!

299
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:58,175
And, now!

300
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,344
See anything?

301
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,082
Don't kill it!
You see anything?

302
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,282
Do you see anything?

303
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:10,121
Feldman, answer my question,
do you see anything?

304
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:13,825
Do not kill the camera,
just give him a second to...

305
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,660
Fuck!

306
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:23,731
...that you live in, but if I'm gonna be here
to yada yada, clean this up a little bit,

307
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:27,271
I mean, as far as the tapes go, can
I make like a box, like the...

308
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:30,905
- OK.
- You got a shoe box , or...

309
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,841
We'll just work on this
another day.

310
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:35,747
Do we have a backup plan here?

311
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:41,449
Dude, dude, dude, dude!
Are you seeing that?

312
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,785
Am I seeing what?

313
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,219
Feldman, look right there!

314
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,421
Feldman, look right there!

315
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:48,225
- Yeah! I know.
- Do you see that?

316
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,861
What?
Was that there or...

317
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:54,796
Do you see that?
What the fuck is that?

318
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,865
- I didn't add it!
- Are you serious?

319
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,302
- Oh, my gosh, I think...
- Holy shit!

320
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,970
Is there any way that you can
brighten this, like whatsoever.

321
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:07,008
Yeah, yeah, I mean it's gonna look
like hell, but no, I can do it.

322
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,911
OK, do you want me to take
the camera right now?

323
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,478
So, I'm bringing up
the light.

324
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,150
Cool, cool, do it!

325
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:17,920
- Gosh, dude!
- Bang!

326
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,287
Right fucking there!

327
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,724
That was right
on the hour mark.

328
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,324
Zoom in, zoom in.

329
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,960
Alright, this is the closest
I can get with that,

330
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,962
and like still be able to see
shit, so you ready?

331
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:31,201
Alright, alright, go, go!

332
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:35,205
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my gosh!

333
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,407
Look at that
motherfucker!

334
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,209
You're kidding me!

335
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,777
Like five minutes ago,
this is all over,

336
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,113
but we have Peeping Tom here!

337
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:47,985
- We fucking got him, man!
- Oh my gosh!

338
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:56,225
<i>I don't see any signs that it was
faked, in the sense that like it was...</i>

339
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,826
<i>like someone went in with a
computer and added something,</i>

340
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,830
<i>like there's nothing in there that I
can definitively point to and say:</i>

341
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:02,965
<i>"OK, this is a fake."</i>

342
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,866
<i>So, I would go with that,</i>

343
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:06,501
<i>at the same time, you know,</i>

344
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:07,969
<i>it's a small little video,</i>

345
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:09,371
<i>there's not a lot of detail,</i>

346
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,940
<i>so I'm hesitant
to commit either way,</i>

347
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,776
<i>but I, if it was...</i>

348
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,813
<i>if something were there, it
would probably look like that.</i>

349
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,516
You were convinced that that
would just

350
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:26,455
be natural lighting, no manipulation as
far as that particular shot is concerned.

351
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:31,125
<i>Well, I'm not convinced of anything,
it's certainly plausible.</i>

352
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,928
Right, but you're not
ruling it out.

353
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,395
<i>I can't point to
anything and say:</i>

354
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,831
<i>"This makes is a fake."</i>

355
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,431
<i>It could be a guy, dressed up,</i>

356
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,301
<i>standing up in the back maybe,</i>

357
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:42,403
<i>like, you know, it could be
a practical kind of hoax,</i>

358
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:45,574
<i>like someone could have taken
this and in a computer,</i>

359
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,442
<i>it's gone and manipulated it.</i>

360
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:53,181
The idea of the technological
equivalent of the actual eye,

361
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:56,818
which is actually
a part of the human organism,

362
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,923
and the human mind, the idea of using a
camera as a real equivalent of that,

363
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:06,562
metaphysical equivalent, strikes me as...
I have a hard time with that.

364
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:11,035
I don't know, man, you, I mean we're sitting
here trying to explain spirits, so...

365
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:14,303
If you want to have a rational
conversation about ghosts

366
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:18,373
and goblins versus camera
technology, I'm not really sure.

367
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,909
<i>So, where are we?
What are we doing?</i>

368
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:23,545
We are at the VFW
in Glen Burnie, Maryland,

369
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:28,984
and I'm gonna go and present some of
the footage to an assembled group

370
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:34,926
of paranormal investigators,
ghosthunters and get some allies here.

371
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,192
<i>What's the end game
here tonight?</i>

372
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:41,263
Well, the end game is that when
we do the press conference,

373
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,432
I can have a handful of these
people standing beside me saying:

374
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,034
"Footage is real,

375
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,069
we're behind you, Gavin,
we believe you!"

376
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:52,240
And then they... I think they reach
some 10,000 people or something, so...

377
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:55,477
Our Facebook page
has over 8,000 likes

378
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:58,479
and most of those people

379
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:02,551
are into the paranormal or they
want to be on our Facebook page.

380
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:07,655
So, yes, I could put it out
there for others to see.

381
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:11,226
We're just gonna show the image
of Peeping Tom coming up to the tunnel.

382
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:14,595
<i>Why are you only showing the
ghost and apparently the ghost proofs?</i>

383
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:16,297
<i>Just that one shot.</i>

384
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,400
I don't think they need any
of the other information,

385
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,602
I think right now we're just
trying to determine whether

386
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:24,273
or not Peeping Tom is a real
entity and the story about

387
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:29,111
Sophia and the big guns and on the actual
what happened. I think you want to see that.

388
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:32,113
The only plausible explanation
that you folks could think

389
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,216
and myself and the first thing
I thought of

390
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,117
was this has got to be a guy
in a suit,

391
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,253
this is somebody standing there
at the end of the tunnel,

392
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:41,023
they're playing
a practical joke, OK?

393
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:45,526
The thing that this bunks that theory
however is the fact that the metadata

394
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:48,162
on both cameras say that there
was no one else there.

395
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:51,603
One camera films the other camera,
we've got proof of both of that

396
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:55,036
it turned on, this is what happens
when they played it back.

397
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,073
Right now you just want to pick everybody's
interest, we're gonna get them to talk,

398
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,575
"Who's Peeping Tom, the tunnel?"
Right here in your mind. Just phew!

399
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:03,378
<i>Gonna get it
so he showed you.</i>

400
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,546
Until he shows us more,
we just don't know.

401
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:09,551
- <i>Right!</i>
- We believe there's a possibility,

402
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:10,622
but we need more evidence.

403
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:18,994
Saying everything else for, you know, that
next big steps will be wolf's surprise.

404
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:22,064
It'll probably work out
a lot better too.

405
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,065
So you know, you can see
what I saw.

406
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,601
I mean the journey that
we've already been on.

407
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:28,603
You can't tell that this isn't
gonna be the shot,

408
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:33,674
this is Gavin's chance, this is
my second chance to make it.

409
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,242
<i>Fortune and glory!</i>

410
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:36,611
<i>Let's go back a little
bit,</i>

411
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,580
<i>let's talk about you
as a filmmaker.</i>

412
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:41,016
<i>You went to school for
filmmaking?</i>

413
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:44,018
<i>Yeah, my non-degree, that's what
I like to tell everybody it was.</i>

414
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,655
He does a lot of weddings, so,
you know, there's wedding season

415
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:53,061
and then in the off season it's
kind of a little bit more spotty.

416
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:55,263
And then as the years went by,

417
00:23:55,265 --> 00:24:01,335
it became a way to pay the bills and to
still convince myself that I'm a filmmaker.

418
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:05,507
Now, it's just a way
to pay the bills.

419
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:09,012
<i>Isn't this wedding
season right now?</i>

420
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,382
Yeah, it's July.

421
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:16,086
I'm sorry, I don't want to
embarrass anybody, but it...

422
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,992
She's always hectic, she's always
happened to come and borrow money and,

423
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:26,795
and that doesn't bother me, that's
what we're here for, right,

424
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:30,097
to make sure that
everything's...

425
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:32,566
We can help out.
Everything's OK.

426
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:36,771
<i>Does Gavin know that
you're getting help?</i>

427
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:39,708
I mean it's not so much help

428
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,645
that it needs to be discussed
or whatever.

429
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:47,516
<i>So, let me ask you a
question, you're taking their film</i>

430
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:49,817
<i>and you're trying to show
it to the world,</i>

431
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:53,154
<i>but why aren't you making this
movie that I'm making right now?</i>

432
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:56,690
<i>Why aren't you doing a film of your
own essentially rather than just,</i>

433
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:58,794
<i>you know, taking somebody
else's and finishing it?</i>

434
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:01,696
Nobody would believe this
if I did it, OK?

435
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:05,132
Nobody's gonna believe a documentary
about me finding footage

436
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:07,169
and putting it together
and running around.

437
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:10,404
That's why we need you, that's why
you're here to tell the story.

438
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:17,481
Because if the audience doesn't believe the
footage, then you're in the same exact place.

439
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:23,388
Come in!

440
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:27,255
Fellas!

441
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:30,092
- Gavin, how are you doing?
- How are you? Gavin York.

442
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:31,293
I want to make sure

443
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:32,827
that this is well thought out,

444
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:34,662
put together with a lot of care.

445
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:37,298
We're in this business because
we like to entertain,

446
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,669
but we're in this business because
we want to make money, OK?

447
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:44,271
It's found footage, I understand,
it's a found footage style.

448
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:50,447
Well, it's real. As in "It's found
footage, because I found the footage."

449
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:54,216
- OK.
- I actually found it.

450
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:55,717
- Right.
- OK.

451
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:57,719
<i>But you understand
why it looks suspicious</i>

452
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,720
<i>that rather than just putting
the footage out there,</i>

453
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:03,658
<i>you are having it cleaned up
and mixed</i>

454
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,192
<i>for theatrical release.</i>

455
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,728
But who is gonna know that?

456
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,395
<i>You're treating it right now
like a movie.</i>

457
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:10,231
But why can't you treat it both?

458
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:11,900
Cleaning it up kind of
defeats the purpose

459
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:14,568
of it being this gritty found
footage found in a basement.

460
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,571
I guess, I mean I'm not really
trying

461
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:19,207
to walk around and say,
"Hey, look how gritty it is!"

462
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:20,609
It's your project.

463
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:22,477
It all comes down to
how to approach it

464
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:24,478
and when we figure out how
we're gonna approach it,

465
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,180
then we can help you
budget for it.

466
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:27,815
- Sure.
- I understand that

467
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,751
that's a concern. I understand
that it isn't so fun.

468
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,854
- Yeah, yeah, but about that...
- In the project...

469
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,259
<i>Realistically,
how much can you afford?</i>

470
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,863
Realistically,
I can't afford anything.

471
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:47,635
This is an opportunity for us to
get in like on the ground floor.

472
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:52,507
This is a game changer. When
you watch it, you will know.

473
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:54,508
<i>You're trying to get
them to do this...</i>

474
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,912
For free, for zero,
for a piece of the pie.

475
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:01,716
We all know these conversations happen all
the time and in the reality of it is that,

476
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:05,420
as a business,
there's got to be some kind of

477
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:07,889
process that works for us
that keeps our lights on

478
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,360
- so to speak.
- Oh, sure, sure.

479
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:12,459
If I have to pay,

480
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:18,266
I'm willing to go maybe $1,500.

481
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,235
We could probably do about

482
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:24,405
$2,000, but then it's gonna be
a lot of ramen noodles.

483
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:30,946
Most features that get full packages, even on
an indie rate are anywhere from like 10 to 20.

484
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:37,388
I can't leave here without
them agreeing to do this.

485
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,288
Alright, Feldman, just let me
do the talking, OK?

486
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,824
- Sure!
- Cool! Thank you!

487
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:48,830
- Hey, Dr. Wolfe?
- Miss Crane.

488
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:51,632
Hey, I know it's first thing early
in the morning and everything,

489
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:53,735
but we have something
really awesome

490
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,903
to show you for the documentary
and it would be great...

491
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:59,341
Wow, wow. Mr. Feldman, what's
with the camera?

492
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:00,976
I got this, Feldman.

493
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:02,710
It's actually for
the documentary.

494
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,513
There's actually something that
we need to show you.

495
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:07,649
Hey, Feldman, are you rolling?

496
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:08,719
Yeah.

497
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:11,452
All this will become
very clear in five seconds,

498
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:13,555
but we are documenting
this entire process.

499
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:15,726
So, right at 1 a.m.
this is what happened.

500
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:22,396
- Hmm.
- So?

501
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,565
- Nicely done!
- What do you think?

502
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,469
An excellent effect!
You guys have done a good job!

503
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:30,604
No, Dr. Wolfe, this is not an
effect, this is for real!

504
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:32,507
This is not the project
we talked about,

505
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,342
but you've got
a nice premise here,

506
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,910
you've got something
you can work with,

507
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:38,313
you can turn this into
a very sweet horror film.

508
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:39,948
- We...
- Just one second, OK?

509
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,350
My camera it's about run out
of batteries.

510
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:44,753
OK, get the camera, please. OK,
this is grey data, Dr. Wolfe.

511
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:48,492
We need your
advising right now, OK? This...

512
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
...psychodrama you're trying
to do here

513
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:55,764
and I respect, you're trying
to be creative and all,

514
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,632
but I'm very uncomfortable
with you filming me.

515
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:00,669
There would not have been
enough time to put all these

516
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:02,671
enhancements in it
and everything else.

517
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:05,073
This guy doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

518
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,908
Take five, Feldman.

519
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,510
Look, I would not
put my good name on the line.

520
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:12,380
Did you have that tape
in your hands

521
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:16,750
24/7 from the moment that you
walked away from that tunnel?

522
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:20,322
Feldman is a slacker, he's in the
seventh year of his six-year plan

523
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:23,525
to get through school and, you
know what? He's a genius.

524
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,392
He's a genius when it comes
to the camera

525
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:26,760
and doing things with it.

526
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:28,830
Well, I called
Mr. Folklore

527
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:30,398
and left a message
on his machine,

528
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,066
so I guess we should

529
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:33,003
have talked to him first.

530
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,071
Well, why don't we
just go talk to him now?

531
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:38,539
My big thing is how did anybody
look at that footage

532
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,074
and say that it's not real?

533
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:44,645
That's what I'm saying.
Obviously, we're still learning.

534
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:46,650
Like, you just can't fake that.

535
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,586
- Come on!
- Anything?

536
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,955
- No!
- Awesome!

537
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:56,360
I'm gonna check the side.

538
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,796
Honestly, I feel a little weird about
creeping in his window, but...

539
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,433
This is a folklore guy, I'm sure
this is the least creepy thing about it.

540
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,135
Yeah.

541
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:09,874
- Anything?
- No!

542
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,912
Shit! Now what?

543
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,581
1527?

544
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:23,718
Oh, this is it, this is it,
right here.

545
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,323
You guys, this is the house.

546
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:28,792
Oh, my God.

547
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:32,494
Just like being in a dream, I can't
believe we're actually here.

548
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:37,766
It was undoubtedly through the <i>Weird</i>
books that I have worked on for a good...

549
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:43,004
It was about 7-8 years I was working
on this series of <i>Weird</i> books

550
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:45,940
and certainly in
Pennsylvania and Maryland,

551
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:48,476
this is what
I'm best known for.

552
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,582
- Mr. Lake!
- Mr. York!

553
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:55,917
- Call me, Gavin, please!
- Gavin.

554
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,852
This is the camera crew
and everybody!

555
00:30:57,854 --> 00:30:59,019
Hi! Come on...

556
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,488
Just don't pay them any mind,

557
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,756
they're just gonna do
their thing.

558
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:04,159
- OK.
- This place is great!

559
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,728
I have to tell you, this is
an absolute thrill,

560
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,730
it's been about six months
I've been studying this place.

561
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:12,033
Wow, that's kind of unusual!

562
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,971
Right here, this is it!

563
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:19,073
This is it, this is the spot
where you gave your interview.

564
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:21,508
- I vaguely remember it.
- Ten years ago!

565
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,747
Yeah! I don't often have
crews in my house.

566
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:28,149
Yeah, Gavin sent me
a message on Facebook

567
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:31,819
and he told me that he found
small footage of me,

568
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:33,755
so I'm kind of interested
to see the footage.

569
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,757
<i>Keep your eyes open</i>

570
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,792
<i>for a long time because that's
how you conjure him up.</i>

571
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:39,661
<i>When he's right up there,</i>

572
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,528
<i>the temptation is dead staring
you in the face,</i>

573
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,800
<i>you do anything
you can to avoid him.</i>

574
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,172
Nice doorbell, Feldman.

575
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:04,552
OK, wait a minute.
Why are we doing it here

576
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,120
and not at my house with
the rest of the footage?

577
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:08,122
Because I don't want to
unplug the camera from the TV

578
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:10,557
and I don't want to unplug
anything, I can't lose,

579
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,927
I don't want to go away. The last
time we did it on your computer,

580
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,997
we had the tapes in my camera,
now it's in this,

581
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:17,765
just let me do my thing
right now, OK?

582
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,534
I got the time codes
written down.

583
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,005
OK, but what are you doing?

584
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:25,576
I just gotta show you.

585
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:32,680
I gotta say this is
a real treat for me.

586
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:36,183
You don't have any idea
how much you validate

587
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:38,786
what I'm working on right now,
which is really great.

588
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:40,787
Just feed this up through
your chain.

589
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:43,790
So tell me about your role
in the documentary.

590
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,860
Oh, it was, it was minimal.

591
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:50,632
The two people came, they got in
touch with me, they came around

592
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:55,737
and, yeah, we were here for an hour or
so and then they, then they moved on.

593
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,271
That was the last I saw
them, just once.

594
00:32:57,273 --> 00:33:00,741
Sophia, Feldman. How did they
get in touch with you?

595
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:06,213
Email, was it phone, did they call
you, did somebody, friend of a friend?

596
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:08,650
I'm gonna tell you the truth,
I don't remember.

597
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:10,084
It was a decade ago.

598
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,220
When you got in touch with me,
I was...

599
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:17,659
I searched my email archives and
didn't find anything there,

600
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:21,895
if it was the phone, then, you
know, I don't keep phone records.

601
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:25,600
So, is there a reason why Peeping Tom
was excluded from <i>Weird Maryland,</i>

602
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:30,037
obviously the Ilchester tunnel is in
Maryland, any reason not to include it?

603
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:37,045
It just wasn't as strong a story, I had that
kind of a vibe about it that felt more like

604
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,814
what we call fakelore rather
than folklore.

605
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:42,784
- OK.
- I have a lot more stories

606
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,084
than I have pages to...

607
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,788
Alright, let's talk about
the footage.

608
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:50,658
I wasn't a part of it, you know,
I just watched it for a few...

609
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,693
Sure, but as an expert,

610
00:33:52,695 --> 00:33:58,165
let's get an authoritative kind of
dissertation on that, if you will.

611
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:04,072
That thing at the end
of the tunnel with the...

612
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:07,208
- Peeping Tom.
- Peeping Tom coming in,

613
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,844
it was a very striking image,

614
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:12,146
it was iconic,
it was an iconic image.

615
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:15,853
Pretty scary.
What about what happened next?

616
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,291
Are you rolling
on this, right?

617
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:25,126
- Yeah.
- Alright.

618
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:26,961
What are you trying
to show me?

619
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:28,695
- Just watch.
- OK.

620
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:30,097
There, did you see it?

621
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,965
OK, no.
What am I looking for?

622
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,369
- I'm gonna rewind.
- OK.

623
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:38,271
Alright. Look in the back
on top of the building on the left.

624
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:40,008
There, there!

625
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,242
OK, so it's like
a giant bird, right?

626
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:45,045
No, it's not a giant bird.

627
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:46,680
OK, what is it?

628
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,018
What do you think it is?

629
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:51,251
When I go to change the battery
and I turn out and there!

630
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:53,220
- Where am I looking?
- There!

631
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:55,356
Right there,
next to the air duct.

632
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:56,758
Wait a minute.

633
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,159
But remember the spot.

634
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,726
I'm gonna go forward.

635
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:01,929
I remember,
we turned it off and...

636
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:04,766
OK, wait a minute,
dude...

637
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,300
This is as far
as I've got.

638
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:09,269
OK, come on,
show me the other footage.

639
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:12,240
- Alright, well...
- You got me a little excited.

640
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,075
Oh, I'm running, run, run.

641
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,709
- Did you see that?
- No!

642
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:16,878
OK, OK, wait, wait!

643
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,713
Play, play, alright.

644
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,815
Get ready, ready, right there!

645
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:22,282
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

646
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:23,851
Rewind, rewind!

647
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:25,722
Ready, don't blink!

648
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:29,057
- Here! There, see that?
- That's right.

649
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:32,025
- Got it!
- Press pause!

650
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:33,695
- Pause.
- Bingo!

651
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:35,162
Oh, right there.

652
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:37,398
Oh, my gosh, dude,
it's fucking Blinkman!

653
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,900
Yeah, the thing is
we're not the ones blinking,

654
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,802
it's the camera that's blinking,

655
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:43,704
so every time I'm making
a new clip, he's there.

656
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,976
Yeah, wait a minute!

657
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:52,447
Every single time we turn the
camera on and off and it blinks,

658
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:55,786
he's almost,
he's getting closer.

659
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:01,255
Well, I had no idea I was
being involved with a film

660
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:04,492
of that kind, it was kind of
scary, it was well constructed.

661
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:08,829
So that was, so what we just watched,
your opinion is that it's fake.

662
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:12,800
That there's no Peeping Tom, there's no,
they didn't find anything in that tunnel.

663
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,101
- Yeah.
- This is all?

664
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:16,838
- It looked like...
- All non-weird.

665
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,373
- It's...
- It didn't make your book.

666
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,309
What I'm just trying
to figure out is...

667
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,945
Two human beings, alright,
these are two people,

668
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:25,682
you are the only link

669
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:30,952
to them even existing and I called you, I
explained to you how important you were.

670
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:35,789
It just seems to me that you're not taking
it as seriously as I thought you would.

671
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,224
As an esteemed author would.

672
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,959
You're kind of brushing
it off a little bit,

673
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:40,494
you live all the way out here,

674
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,231
far away from anybody
to be able to track you down.

675
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:46,099
You don't have emails
conveniently right after,

676
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,336
right after they came and talked to you.
"I don't remember who it was.

677
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:52,240
I had a phone line that've been
bouncing my service back and forth."

678
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:54,976
Who does that? Nobody bounces
their service back and forth.

679
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:56,878
It just sounds to me like
a lot of conjecture, sir.

680
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,983
You wouldn't be involved in
their disappearance, well then?

681
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:04,351
- That's ridiculous!
- Is it so ridiculous?

682
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:09,389
Because it's, it's... I don't
know, that was a documentary!

683
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:10,458
It was a documentary.

684
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,858
Were you gonna say stupid?

685
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,528
No, I'm not gonna say stupid!

686
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,396
I can find stuff
that's pretty stupid.

687
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:17,164
I mean, I know it's all
that year, but...

688
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,532
But it's well put together.

689
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,034
Look, can we cut this please?

690
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:21,869
I'm done, I'm done! Sorry!

691
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,804
- Would you like to leave, please?
- No!

692
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:27,041
Miller's castle, I just don't
understand why you're not...

693
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:29,577
I just want you to answer
whether or not these people

694
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:33,481
exist or not. I can get out of here,
I can validate this whole thing.

695
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,416
- I'm done, I'm done!
- Just seem awfully enough

696
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,820
- weird to me!
- Turn this thing off, please!

697
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:40,188
So all he ought to fucking do...

698
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,289
was to answer
two goddamn questions.

699
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:46,427
"Did he know who Sophie and
Feldman were?" And:

700
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:50,063
"Were they coming to make
a fake horror movie

701
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:54,601
or were they're legitimate
documentarian filmmakers,

702
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:57,875
looking to prove or
disprove...?"

703
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,778
Fuck!

704
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,931
Hi buddy, how are you doing?

705
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:26,068
You want to give your dad a hug?
I missed you!

706
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:30,340
Did you stay inside,
did you see the rain?

707
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,608
Can I get a hug, please?

708
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,054
How did it go?

709
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,090
It didn't go well,
that's for sure.

710
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:50,394
Why're you using my computer?

711
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,362
Why is it your computer?

712
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,329
It's got all my work on it!

713
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:59,599
I've started the computer
to do our finances.

714
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,003
OK!

715
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:05,842
- Alright!
- Talk?

716
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:09,146
We're talking right now.

717
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:18,151
You know these guys are following me around,
Mel, sometimes the story comes out.

718
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:22,059
Let's go in here.
Come on, we'll talk. Come on!

719
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:24,994
We had another letter.

720
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,866
- From the bank.
- OK.

721
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:34,635
- About our house.
- Well, just take

722
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:37,137
- the money out of savings.
- We don't have savings!

723
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:40,206
What about the budget that
we talked about on Thanksgiving?

724
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,409
Yeah, and then
your movie happened.

725
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:46,646
My movie. Listen, it's all gonna
be worth it in the end,

726
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:51,217
as soon as this hits,
no more wedding jobs!

727
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,621
This is it,
this is what it takes, OK?

728
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:56,190
There's always gonna be
a tough time, alright?

729
00:39:56,192 --> 00:40:01,028
Isn't it gonna be great if we can sit back
and we can say, "Carter, what happened?"

730
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,965
Carter!
Carter needs shoes.

731
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:07,300
These guys in here right now, I don't
want to get into this anymore.

732
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:10,137
- Alright? We're done!
- Yeah! We're done.

733
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:11,909
Done!

734
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,179
OK, so the camera was
a test subject

735
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,213
and stared without blinking for
the entire hour,

736
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,983
then according to the legend
now sees Peeping Tom

737
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:25,186
and every time it blinks,
he gets closer.

738
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,054
So, in other words,
every time we turn it off

739
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,055
and then on, or make a new clip.

740
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:32,325
Yeah. There's our thesis,
he's in our camera.

741
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,595
My camera, and yeah, you
know, first he's there in the tunnel,

742
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:37,597
and he was there
again when we met our adviser,

743
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,566
and again when we went
to see the author,

744
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:42,536
and in each case,
he got incrementally closer.

745
00:40:42,538 --> 00:40:48,242
But he's still hiding in the frame, he's making
this a game, because no one will believe us,

746
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:50,213
so we have to draw him
out in the open.

747
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:54,418
Why I feel you're not
as excited about this as I am?

748
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:59,086
Feldman, assuming this all
really happening...

749
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:00,621
It's really happening!

750
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:03,224
Do you realize what this means?

751
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,096
Yeah, it means
we're filming him right now.

752
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:13,800
OK, hey, turn it off,
turn it off.

753
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,503
Oh, what's your
problem?

754
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,505
My problem is that
I'm still directing this

755
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,440
and I don't want this
camera on until we figure out

756
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,474
what we're gonna do, OK?
Turn it off!

757
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:26,079
OK, so the camera's... what was
that? Did you hear it?

758
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,148
Yeah.

759
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:31,418
It sounds like it's at the
beginning of each new clip.

760
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,519
It's a digital...

761
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,354
Something to do with
the camera, man,

762
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:36,057
I mean it might be
a messed up camera...

763
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:37,590
Something to do with the camera.

764
00:41:37,592 --> 00:41:39,559
Alright, Feldman,
just let me do the talking, OK?

765
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:42,563
It's on every clip after
the bridge

766
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:45,699
section, so that's gonna be a lot
of us going through every piece.

767
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:48,202
Wait a second,
every one after the bridge?

768
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:50,537
So, as soon as
Peeping Tom shows up,

769
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:53,240
this sound shows up at the same
time, is what you're saying.

770
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,313
This is a little crazy, but it,

771
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:04,584
it kind of,
kind of looks like Morse code.

772
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:06,753
Like, why would it only show up
after the Peeping Tom?

773
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:09,155
I don't know, you're the one
that's got it documented.

774
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:11,157
I'm just asking you,
as a better person.

775
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,427
- Documentary crew...
- What do you think

776
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,496
as a human being?
Why would that show up like...

777
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:17,764
I don't know, it's something
that you want us to see.

778
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:20,800
I do think, it's not you, man, maybe
it's not even that you put it in there,

779
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:24,804
maybe it's that these guys did
when they shot this footage.

780
00:42:24,806 --> 00:42:26,609
This is a little crazy, though.

781
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,411
What the fuck, shut the fuck up!

782
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:33,514
What?

783
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:37,450
What does it translate to? Say
it out, say it out loud, please!

784
00:42:37,452 --> 00:42:39,854
- It says Blink.
- Alright, can you guys do me

785
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:41,655
a favor?
Can you look at the camera?

786
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,590
I believe that you've done
a good job of...

787
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:46,226
Can you look at the camera?
I need you to authenticate this.

788
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:48,295
- I need your help.
- Authenticate it?

789
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,664
Just stare in the camera and

790
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,467
say what you
just found for them.

791
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:57,137
I think it's completely faked.

792
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,608
Whoever shot the footage,

793
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,876
these people that supposedly
aren't around anymore,

794
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:05,479
they clearly put
this sound in there.

795
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:09,383
OK, so maybe they did it,
to so whoever...

796
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,452
So if the guy gives the tape...
whoever finds the footage

797
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,621
and then uncovers
this Morse code

798
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:17,724
or this specific sound that
happens every time.

799
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:20,327
That's a lot of work, they would
have had to shot the footage,

800
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,695
offload it, edit it and put it
back on DV tapes.

801
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:24,498
Yeah, OK, well...

802
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,867
- And then, and then...
- He could have done that too.

803
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:30,170
We don't know, man, we don't know where
these tapes were before they came here.

804
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,771
He's coming here
and he tells us a story,

805
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:33,807
then we either believe
or we don't believe.

806
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,682
Blink test, take one.

807
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:46,489
Blink test, take two.

808
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,293
Blink test, take three.

809
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:54,795
Blink test, take seven.

810
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:56,829
Blink test, take 13.

811
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:57,932
Blink test, take 19.

812
00:43:57,934 --> 00:43:59,465
Blink test, take 25.

813
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,467
Blink test, take 32.

814
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,139
Blink test, take 40.

815
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:10,411
<i>I do not believe
that this video is authentic.</i>

816
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:14,315
<i>One thing that's really suspicious
to me is that it always appears</i>

817
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:18,755
<i>and disappears, like either
off-screen or behind something.</i>

818
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,923
<i>The one where the car goes past</i>

819
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:26,226
<i>like that's just like another
really common trick</i>

820
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:29,563
<i>to use to make a ghost disappear
if you're hoaxing a video.</i>

821
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:31,632
<i>I guess here's two points about
the blink test</i>

822
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:32,999
<i>that seemed very suspicious.</i>

823
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,668
<i>One is that</i>

824
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,436
<i>Feldman steps in front
of the camera</i>

825
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:38,238
<i>every time he turned it on.</i>

826
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,940
<i>The record button's
on the back of the camera</i>

827
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:41,941
<i>and it just seems
like a convenient way</i>

828
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:43,844
<i>to reveal the figure.</i>

829
00:44:43,846 --> 00:44:45,311
<i>Like they...</i>

830
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:46,780
<i>I know making it black and white</i>

831
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:49,316
<i>is a film student's
stylistic choice,</i>

832
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:51,719
but it certainly makes it easier

833
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:55,224
<i>to hide effects
and hide manipulation.</i>

834
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:58,958
- Let's talk about metadata.
- <i>OK.</i>

835
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,863
Alright, the metadata. There are timestamps
that show the progression of events.

836
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:05,499
<i>You can fake that.</i>

837
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:07,735
You're accusing me of faking
this whole thing.

838
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:10,838
<i>Look, I don't know you,
I'm not gonna say that...</i>

839
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,606
No, but you'll take my money,
you'll take my money, though.

840
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:16,744
<i>For my opinion,
which I'm giving you.</i>

841
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:21,882
But we got the
ghost group which isn't too bad,

842
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:25,351
<i>It seems like they
were sort of your last resort.</i>

843
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:27,887
They were,

844
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:29,623
but they have a lot of reach

845
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,427
and if they believe in orbs...

846
00:45:32,628 --> 00:45:37,498
I mean, this is certainly a lot
bigger, more real than orbs.

847
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,932
And there you have it, folks,

848
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:45,371
the footage, the found footage
I've assembled for you today.

849
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:48,775
With your help, we can figure
out the mystery, together,

850
00:45:48,777 --> 00:45:51,780
and that's why it's very,
very crucial

851
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:56,316
you know, that you follow me
on this quest.

852
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,653
Any questions?

853
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:06,360
No questions! Can I count on
your support? Yes, ma'am.

854
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:09,095
You don't know that they didn't
have somebody to do this,

855
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:11,999
you don't know if any of this is
real, you don't know what they do...

856
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,601
You're right, ma'am, and that's
why we're here this evening,

857
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:16,070
because if I knew
if it was real,

858
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,503
then I wouldn't need you, folks.

859
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:18,671
If he's at the end of the tunnel

860
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:20,340
and those are railroad ties,

861
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:21,809
he'd have to be about
six feet wide.

862
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:22,943
Six feet wide.

863
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:24,744
There's nobody in that video

864
00:46:24,746 --> 00:46:27,014
that you could find in public
records to speak with?

865
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:28,882
I did find this Matt Lake,

866
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:31,584
he's an author of a book
called <i>Weird Maryland,</i>

867
00:46:31,586 --> 00:46:34,088
which you can pick up if you want
to, I mean I don't recommend it.

868
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,557
I find it very hard to believe that
people who come up in front of your group

869
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,392
constantly get grilled
like this,

870
00:46:39,394 --> 00:46:42,528
it seems to me that everybody
be in, everybody be into it.

871
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,097
I'd say this would be
enough to warrant

872
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:47,400
an investigation and a
recreation of the experiment.

873
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:53,706
Paranormal groups need more than
just a piece of visual evidence

874
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,976
to be able to methodologically

875
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:59,112
quantify and qualify an event.

876
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:00,914
We would need audio,
we would need...

877
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:04,751
Sir, sir, all the fancy words
aside, I get what you're saying.

878
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:07,588
All I'm asking you to do, is
either believe it or you don't

879
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,155
and you want to go investigate
it or you don't.

880
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:11,691
I'd like to know what kind of
medications that you take?

881
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,760
I, ma'am, I think that
that's extremely rude

882
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:16,028
and I don't think
that has any bearing on that.

883
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,499
I'd like to ask you what medications
you're on to ask such questions?

884
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:21,534
When you get a film
on Bloody Mary,

885
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:23,704
maybe we'll think about it,

886
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:26,606
but this is a crock and we want
nothing to do with it.

887
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:31,612
And that's inspired ghost tracking. Now,
we're not going out to investigate with you.

888
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:36,416
I'm pretty sure that inspired
ghost tracking...

889
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:39,153
This is not gonna be the last
time that you hear about me.

890
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:40,457
Is this the exit door?

891
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,191
No orbs out there, but thank
you very much, I appreciate it.

892
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:51,999
I'm sure that you'll be hearing
from me in the future and yeah...

893
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:04,547
Turn off the camera, please!

894
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:08,751
I don't want to deal
with it right now.

895
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:12,186
And there he fucking is.

896
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:14,787
Now, our problem is that any
time that we moved the camera,

897
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:17,691
whether we were just moving the camera
or we were in a car or walking,

898
00:48:17,693 --> 00:48:19,659
he was able to flip in
and out of the screen, so,

899
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:21,061
we couldn't keep track of him,

900
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:23,063
but if I leave
the camera where it is,

901
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:25,666
then he's stuck and I got it
where I fucking want him!

902
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:28,771
Now, what we really need to get right
now, is we need to get the ending.

903
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:32,639
Now, the most logical thing
for me to think of is, you know,

904
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:34,744
it's the closeups
as a grand reveal.

905
00:48:36,644 --> 00:48:38,648
Why are you filming me with
the Handycam?

906
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:45,621
You're afraid of my camera.

907
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:49,690
Well, that figures, I mean directors, you
always had this vision and you think

908
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:53,463
what you want to do with it, but behind
the camera, you have no fucking idea!

909
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:57,766
He keeps on getting closer and
that's where he needs to stay.

910
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:03,806
He's on my camera!

911
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:11,481
Oh, shit!

912
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:13,715
Oh, shit!

913
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:17,987
Hey, well, look...

914
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:23,525
What are you up to
with all these journals here?

915
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:27,996
Wait a minute.

916
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:35,004
That's some
kind of

917
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:50,552
OK, Butterfly Kisses,
video diary, whatever, right.

918
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,887
So, I don't really want to
accuse Feldman of doing anything

919
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:57,090
and I'm not even saying
that he's lying, OK?

920
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:58,891
I really do respect him.

921
00:49:58,893 --> 00:50:01,628
But after reading his diary
a little while ago,

922
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,231
and him having
the diagrams of everything,

923
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,967
I just want to record this
for posterity and just

924
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:12,673
make sure that everyone knows that I have
my doubts about this entire project, OK?

925
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,941
Right now,
I have doubts about everything.

926
00:50:14,943 --> 00:50:17,043
Honestly, what could be worse?

927
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:19,612
Knowing that Peeping Tom could
come and get me at any moment

928
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:22,182
or just being humiliated
by the entire thing,

929
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:25,351
knowing that Feldman can show
this at the student film festival

930
00:50:25,353 --> 00:50:27,920
and I look like a fucking ass!

931
00:50:27,922 --> 00:50:31,023
I'm just gonna have to roll with it and
hope the fella isn't fucking with me,

932
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,360
like I'm really,
really starting to believe.

933
00:50:44,172 --> 00:50:48,775
<i>First off, you gave us
the footage and we wanted to see</i>

934
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:50,679
<i>all of those things that
you cut out.</i>

935
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:55,951
<i>Can you please tell us, can you tell
us what</i> Portraits of Dead Friends <i>was?</i>

936
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,956
We actually ended up winning our student
film festival, Best Feature Award for it.

937
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:07,693
The same two filmmakers,
Sophia and Feldman, made a movie

938
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:10,229
called <i>Portraits of Dead Friends</i>
in which they wanted to make

939
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:12,099
a film about people
who were deceased,

940
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,233
but they didn't want to do the
usual kind of, you know:

941
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:17,371
"He was a wonderful person and he
was born in such and such place."

942
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:23,079
So instead, they went to the photograph
that appeared with the person's obituary.

943
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:27,213
Well, A. That has nothing to
do with Peeping Tom.

944
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:29,715
<i>It has everything
to do with Peeping Tom!</i>

945
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:32,251
I didn't want you to
bring that on, oh my gosh!

946
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,253
I'm glad you
laughed at it.

947
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:36,956
- I mean, I'm not good about it.
- You seem pretty OK with it.

948
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,959
Ok, look, the girl's sister
didn't want to talk about her.

949
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:45,932
It was a really good story, so we got
a freaking actor in there, big deal.

950
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,767
<i>As documentary
filmmakers,</i>

951
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:49,769
<i>they were willing
to have an actor</i>

952
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:51,737
<i>play a person
and accept award for it.</i>

953
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:53,139
Sure.

954
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:55,177
Do you think <i>Portraits</i>
was enough...

955
00:51:56,811 --> 00:52:00,046
- without that story?
- What do you mean "Do you think

956
00:52:00,048 --> 00:52:01,847
<i>Portraits</i> was
enough without that story"?

957
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:03,883
There's five stories,
what story?

958
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:05,755
You know what story
I'm talking about.

959
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:08,191
Diana's?

960
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:14,293
The one that we, you know...

961
00:52:14,295 --> 00:52:17,764
I'm not sure about Feldman,
he's got a bit of an attitude,

962
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:21,068
because he wants to be the director,
he wants to be the top dog.

963
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,804
Maybe there was some resentment
going on there.

964
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:28,307
<i>I found a clip
where Feldman</i>

965
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:33,246
<i>is saying that he did not win an
award, that it was just Sophia.</i>

966
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:36,816
What did you do
with your award?

967
00:52:36,818 --> 00:52:38,318
I didn't get one.

968
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,320
Wait, what do you mean,
you didn't get one?

969
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:48,161
I mean, Dr. Wolfe only gave it to
you, and it only has your name on it!

970
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:50,130
Are you serious?

971
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:54,800
Feldman turns out to have his
own mildly unscrupulous streak,

972
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:56,970
because he starts to suggest,

973
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:59,472
there are things we could do

974
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:02,811
if we don't get the image that
we're hoping to get.

975
00:53:04,947 --> 00:53:07,046
There's other things.

976
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:09,851
Like what, like visual
effects, kind of thing?

977
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:14,454
Something like that.

978
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:18,258
So we have then at least three
possibilities here.

979
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,994
We have the possibility that
this whole thing is real,

980
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:22,963
that they caught the image
of Peeping Tom.

981
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:25,865
We have the possibility of two
of them got together,

982
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:30,836
to put together this largely
plausible hoax

983
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:35,141
and we have the possibility that one of
them put together a hoax on the other one.

984
00:53:35,143 --> 00:53:37,779
At least those
three possibilities.

985
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,780
I need to say...

986
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:46,385
I guess my initial prejudice was the slacker
who was kind of quiet in the background,

987
00:53:46,387 --> 00:53:50,856
was the X-factor, yeah, he was
the instigator of the fiction

988
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:53,159
Butterfly Kisses,
video diary one.

989
00:53:53,161 --> 00:54:00,867
On reflection, it seems much more to me as
though Sophia, she maybe crossed the line.

990
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:05,371
You know, when you've invested a lot of time
in a story and the deadline's coming up,

991
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:08,974
the temptation is, yeah,
how do I make this a good story?

992
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:14,817
Unfortunately I can't prove that Peeping Tom
wasn't anything more than just an actor and a hat.

993
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:19,020
Which is kind of sucks, because I don't
know what I'm gonna do from here.

994
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,155
I guess, I'm just gonna need
a new angle.

995
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:25,992
And then, everything
from that that point onwards

996
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:30,032
was a collaboration
in this fiction.

997
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:35,804
It wasn't relevant to the story.

998
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:39,807
<i>What about the scene where they're
standing in the old Ilchester Tunnel,</i>

999
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,913
<i>and Feldman is saying if this doesn't work
with the camera looking through the tunnel,</i>

1000
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,581
<i>we could do a special effect.</i>

1001
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:51,952
I mean that's, I think that's
desperate times and spitballing,

1002
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:54,019
you know, it's just talk,
it's all loose talk.

1003
00:54:54,021 --> 00:54:56,055
When someone wants,
you know,

1004
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:57,590
just to speak their truth
and to bring it out

1005
00:54:57,592 --> 00:55:00,193
to other people and to kind of
have that position

1006
00:55:00,195 --> 00:55:03,429
of leadership and fame and
everything else,

1007
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:08,068
they will cherry-pick certain things
that support what they're doing.

1008
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,637
Your brain is not consciously
cherry-picking,

1009
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:13,974
it is more of an
unconscious thing.

1010
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:16,876
So, it's very easy for someone,

1011
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:19,079
as they're starting to get in

1012
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:25,017
to, you know, kind of an obsessive behavior
or a delusion is starting to be created

1013
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:30,090
where the look at a piece of evidence
and the things that highlight for them,

1014
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:34,360
they zoom and sink into the brain
immediately and then the things that don't,

1015
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:36,963
the brain automatically
kind of just

1016
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:39,398
sections them off like they
don't even exist.

1017
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:45,007
Gavin York's decision to take
that material out

1018
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:50,010
suggests a manipulative,

1019
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:53,280
a very strong manipulative
intent on his part.

1020
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:56,282
If you're working with
all these elements, you can,

1021
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:58,550
journalistically speaking,
you can construct the...

1022
00:55:58,552 --> 00:56:03,289
You run the story out of whatever
footage you choose to put in there.

1023
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:05,525
If he took these scenes out,

1024
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:10,329
then he had a particular
reason for doing it.

1025
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:13,400
Why he's allowing you to put
them back in

1026
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:17,170
or to utilize them in some way,
It's interesting.

1027
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,204
I mean, there's, there's...
Pardon?

1028
00:56:19,206 --> 00:56:22,075
- <i>He signed a release.</i>
- Yeah.

1029
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:23,575
<i>He authorized the use
of the footage</i>

1030
00:56:23,577 --> 00:56:24,614
<i>in this documentary.</i>

1031
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:27,280
<i>There, there are
people who suggested that</i>

1032
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:30,083
<i>perhaps Gavin shot this himself.</i>

1033
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,717
<i>Do you feel that's...</i>

1034
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:34,554
I don't think that's true.

1035
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:38,458
Simply because,
when would he have done it?

1036
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,162
I mean, my mom found the tapes
in the basement, so...

1037
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:45,401
<i>Why do you own
a Panasonic DVX100?</i>

1038
00:56:48,436 --> 00:56:54,441
- <i>That's the camera that Feldman filmed the documentary on.</i>
- OK.

1039
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:57,077
<i>They say he goes away
on a lot of trips.</i>

1040
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:59,448
Yeah, he goes
where the weddings are.

1041
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:02,918
<i>Does the money all match up?</i>

1042
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,121
Usually!

1043
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:12,527
Stop!

1044
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:19,268
I want the tapes!

1045
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:37,516
What happened to your face?

1046
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:41,022
- It itched.
- Are you on something?

1047
00:57:42,356 --> 00:57:47,059
No, I thought the lashes
would tick over the itch.

1048
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:48,998
And the camera,

1049
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:52,298
I locked it in the basement.

1050
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,236
I threw away the battery!

1051
00:57:55,237 --> 00:57:57,369
And when I woke up from
sleeping, it was back.

1052
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:02,175
It was taping me,
he was taping me.

1053
00:58:02,177 --> 00:58:05,612
Do you think it was me that
pressed record for this?

1054
00:58:05,614 --> 00:58:11,684
No, he knew you were coming,
that's how I knew you were coming.

1055
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:16,222
I'm gonna get the ending that
he aimed for before he does,

1056
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:19,291
but then it's all on you,
you got the tapes.

1057
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:24,130
But I'm gonna get all the footage, you
finish this movie like you said you would!

1058
00:58:24,132 --> 00:58:25,467
Remember?

1059
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:28,371
And then he's coming after you.

1060
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:30,836
You're next.

1061
00:58:34,141 --> 00:58:36,144
But you'll win another award!

1062
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,356
This is my new delivery system

1063
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:54,226
www.butterflykissesmovie.com.

1064
00:58:54,228 --> 00:58:58,433
- <i>Hello!</i>
- Hi there, I'm looking for Miss Joanne Tillman?

1065
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:02,702
<i>She's not available right now,
may I take a message?</i>

1066
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:04,838
Yeah, this is Gavin York
calling,

1067
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,876
this is actually the seventh time that
I've called in the past three days.

1068
00:59:09,878 --> 00:59:13,579
On Friday,
when the timer runs down,

1069
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:15,815
from midnight to 1 a.m.,

1070
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:20,552
viewers around the world will be
able to watch footage,

1071
00:59:20,554 --> 00:59:22,222
the found footage,

1072
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:25,691
and be able to make their own
assessment of it.

1073
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:27,594
We're gonna get it out
on the world, so...

1074
00:59:27,596 --> 00:59:29,896
<i>What's gonna
happen after the 24 hours?</i>

1075
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:34,266
The website's gonna be shut down, you're
not gonna be able to see it anymore.

1076
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:35,668
<i>What do you expect
to happen then?</i>

1077
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:39,304
The phone does never stop
ringing after that.

1078
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:40,874
<i>So you'll sell it
to the highest bidder?</i>

1079
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:46,278
Or one, just, you know,
moderate. One, so yeah, yeah.

1080
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,713
I'm not trying to be a jerk,

1081
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:49,749
I just want to find out
how I can speak with

1082
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:52,651
Miss Tillman and
give her some information about

1083
00:59:52,653 --> 00:59:56,523
a local community event that
I've got going on on Friday.

1084
00:59:58,492 --> 00:59:59,561
Hello...

1085
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:06,365
Hello!

1086
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,867
<i>How many,
how many newspapers in...</i>

1087
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:10,105
All of them.

1088
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:12,905
- <i>Already all?</i>
- All of them.

1089
01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:14,374
And you see how it is?

1090
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:15,742
You heard it for yourself,

1091
01:00:15,744 --> 01:00:18,478
they don't give a shit!
Hang up, hang up!

1092
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,382
I mean, unless you...

1093
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:23,583
Do you know somebody?

1094
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:25,653
<i>You know, we can't
get involved.</i>

1095
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:28,521
<i>We have to stay
on this side of the camera.</i>

1096
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,889
Stay on that side of the camera
if you want to, man.

1097
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:36,662
I mean, I don't know why you guys want to
sit here and film me, and not get involved,

1098
01:00:36,664 --> 01:00:39,798
because you're just wasting
your time too.

1099
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,570
There's no ending to
this movie whatsoever.

1100
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:45,537
You get an awesome ending
for your movie,

1101
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:47,639
I get an awesome
ending for my movie.

1102
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:51,813
Nobody's lying, nobody's saying
anything fake, alright?

1103
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:57,418
All I'm asking for is one
telephone number and a name.

1104
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:02,889
And that we can go, and we can speak to that
person and we can put this whole story out there.

1105
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:04,360
I don't think...

1106
01:01:06,293 --> 01:01:07,529
it's cheating

1107
01:01:08,563 --> 01:01:10,633
if it's for the great reward.

1108
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,999
It's DC 101,
I'm Mike Jones and

1109
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:15,767
in studio today I've been
talking about

1110
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:18,371
this found footage all
week, <i>Butterfly Kisses.</i>

1111
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,673
Gavin York, the guy that
discovered this footage,

1112
01:01:20,675 --> 01:01:22,708
and you could see it for
yourself, if you haven't yet,

1113
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,577
until midnight tonight at
butterflykissesmovie.com.

1114
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:27,246
Gavin York,
how you doing, brother?

1115
01:01:27,248 --> 01:01:28,447
I'm doing great, thanks for...

1116
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:29,849
I just don't understand the deal

1117
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:31,583
with this guy, man,

1118
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:34,519
why are you filming him,
what's in it for you with this?

1119
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:36,588
<i>It's supposed to be</i>

1120
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:40,260
<i>a really fantastic, fascinated
character study. And then it is!</i>

1121
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:41,927
<i>Nobody wants to come to...</i>

1122
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:44,463
Because this has been done
a thousand times before.

1123
01:01:44,465 --> 01:01:45,831
And we think it's a scam.

1124
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,833
I'm not the only one,
it's everyone!

1125
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:49,869
<i>I know, but that's the
problem that I've got right now,</i>

1126
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:51,903
<i>I've got hours and hours of
footage that we've shot,</i>

1127
01:01:51,905 --> 01:01:54,039
<i>but we don't have an ending to
this documentary.</i>

1128
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,782
And you give me this
opportunity to...

1129
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:05,485
- This is the...
- This is amazing!

1130
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:10,555
It's alright, I got your back.

1131
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:15,360
- Just don't...
- Alright.

1132
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:19,298
Alright, well, we'll see what
the people have to say, it's 8669 1 DC 101.

1133
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,800
Hi, DC 101!

1134
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,802
<i>Yeah, you actually
think there's</i>

1135
01:02:22,804 --> 01:02:25,641
<i>anyone stupid enough
to fall for that?</i>

1136
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:30,342
<i>The video quality
sucks, it's all fake.</i>

1137
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:32,445
Gavin, do you have anything
to say?

1138
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:36,349
Well, I mean, this would be something
in 2004 to address with them!

1139
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:39,751
<i>No man, you totally didn't
do this in 2004, you did this just now.</i>

1140
01:02:39,753 --> 01:02:42,789
I didn't do anything in 2004,
I just assembled it now.

1141
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:44,523
I'm not trying to profit
off anything.

1142
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:46,059
Have you looked for them?

1143
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:47,459
<i>Take it
to the police...</i>

1144
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:50,862
<i>...just check it out,
that's bogus.</i>

1145
01:02:50,864 --> 01:02:53,333
Gavin, skepticism is just
everywhere.

1146
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:56,034
- Yes, a lot of hatred out there.
- A little bit, a little bit.

1147
01:02:56,036 --> 01:02:58,670
<i>Hang it up and find something
else that you might be good at.</i>

1148
01:02:58,672 --> 01:03:02,075
<i>Change yourself, because you're
trying to profit off of somebody's death.</i>

1149
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:05,043
<i>You think that people are
gonna fall for this</i>.

1150
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:07,045
<i>Showing a hoax it's...</i>

1151
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:09,749
<i>The second I spent
watching that piece of...</i>

1152
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,483
You seem like a
stoner...

1153
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:12,952
<i>...whichever project...</i>

1154
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:14,954
<i>...wrong about this,
cursed...</i>

1155
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:16,389
<i>...not real.</i>

1156
01:03:20,961 --> 01:03:22,795
Hello, DC 101, who's this?

1157
01:03:22,797 --> 01:03:23,829
<i>Stanley.</i>

1158
01:03:23,831 --> 01:03:25,565
Stan, what you gotta say
to Gavin?

1159
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:32,003
Alright, I'll tell you what.

1160
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:33,405
I'll give him five minutes

1161
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:34,574
and I think I've got a guy,

1162
01:03:34,576 --> 01:03:36,441
we can get my producer to call.

1163
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:38,543
It'll be good. See what happens.

1164
01:03:38,545 --> 01:03:40,612
<i>Good for him or?</i>

1165
01:03:40,614 --> 01:03:43,051
It'll be good for us.

1166
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:47,787
Gavin, listen, I know
people have been blasting you.

1167
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,121
I want to...

1168
01:03:49,123 --> 01:03:51,557
This is the call that
we've been waiting for,

1169
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,693
let me bring him on here.

1170
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:55,961
- Hello, caller!
- <i>Yes.</i>

1171
01:03:55,963 --> 01:03:57,729
Hi, let me introduce you.

1172
01:03:57,731 --> 01:04:01,501
Gavin, this is Ed Sanchez,
the king of the found footage,

1173
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:03,568
the director
of the <i>Blair Witch Project</i>

1174
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,505
who is calling to talk about
your movie <i>Butterfly Kisses</i>!

1175
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:07,907
Ed, how you doing, brother?

1176
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:09,608
<i>I'm doing well, man
how's it going?</i>

1177
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,744
- Good.
- Good afternoon! Big, big fan!

1178
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:13,612
I've seen the footage.

1179
01:04:13,614 --> 01:04:18,016
You know, it doesn't look
completely genuine to me.

1180
01:04:18,018 --> 01:04:22,155
You know, I think there's some acting
involved, there's some effects involved,

1181
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:25,657
and I think that it's kind of
disturbing that he feels that

1182
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:29,494
the only way to market this
footage is to pretend it's real.

1183
01:04:29,496 --> 01:04:33,800
So, you know, I just kind of had
to speak out about it, you know?

1184
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:35,802
<i>I understand
where Gavin's coming from,</i>

1185
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:38,204
<i>but, you know, he's trying to,
you know,</i>

1186
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:40,807
<i>get in the business,
he's trying to make this film,</i>

1187
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:43,175
<i>but it's just
been done before, it's a...</i>

1188
01:04:43,177 --> 01:04:46,045
Did you do this to start your
career in Hollywood?

1189
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:48,815
Is this your way of maybe
kicking that door open?

1190
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:51,918
I've been a filmmaker since
I was about 12 years old.

1191
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,786
Right, that's why
everyone's saying

1192
01:04:53,788 --> 01:04:57,990
that this is not footage
that is legitimate,

1193
01:04:57,992 --> 01:04:59,791
that you created this
on your computer.

1194
01:04:59,793 --> 01:05:01,193
I completely understand that.

1195
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:02,461
And you've made this
your film.

1196
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,862
You're a professional.

1197
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,664
Could you have made this
on a computer at home

1198
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,798
with just a few projects?

1199
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,467
At least for me, as a filmmaker,

1200
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:09,901
you can tell that there's
some stuff

1201
01:05:09,903 --> 01:05:13,072
that is obviously,
you know, manipulated.

1202
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:14,941
There's like these moments of...

1203
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:18,010
Where just the camera happens
to be on, to capture a moment.

1204
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:20,979
That's like a big thing
of found footage is like.

1205
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:25,016
The camera happens to be on while
something crazy's happening,

1206
01:05:25,018 --> 01:05:28,220
you know, you just don't have that
kind of luck in life, you know.

1207
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,958
The whole legend is that the
footage is found in a shoebox

1208
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,561
and the footage carefully shows
like oh, here's this shoebox

1209
01:05:36,563 --> 01:05:39,699
that we found it in here, I'll
show it in front of the camera,

1210
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:43,568
which is like something that they're
setting up the shoebox, you know.

1211
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,704
To me those are kind of,
you know,

1212
01:05:45,706 --> 01:05:48,740
signs that you're setting
something up dramatically.

1213
01:05:48,742 --> 01:05:50,709
In a movie you do that,
you know.

1214
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:52,778
<i>You know, after
the initial buzz of our movie,</i>

1215
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,579
<i>we never pretended that it was
real.</i>

1216
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:56,949
<i>I just have a problem with
him thinking that it's for real.</i>

1217
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:59,284
<i>You know, maybe I think
he has a problem.</i>

1218
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:02,854
Ed, what are gonna be the
consequences if this does come out

1219
01:06:02,856 --> 01:06:04,856
and it's found out that
Gavin made this up?

1220
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:06,791
<i>You're just kind
of really</i>

1221
01:06:06,793 --> 01:06:08,793
<i>destroying your reputation
with this,</i>

1222
01:06:08,795 --> 01:06:10,595
<i>because eventually
somebody's going to come out,</i>

1223
01:06:10,597 --> 01:06:12,898
<i>some proof is gonna come out
that this is not real,</i>

1224
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,103
<i>and, you know, people are gonna
ask what were you thinking?</i>

1225
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:20,773
<i>And I'm kind of asking that
right now, what is he thinking?</i>

1226
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:23,775
<i>You know, just fess up,
you know what I mean or...</i>

1227
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:26,144
I'm being about as honest
as I can be about this.

1228
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:28,079
Alright, well, you say so.

1229
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:31,751
Well, Gavin York, check out the
movie butterflykissesmovie.com,

1230
01:06:31,753 --> 01:06:34,653
it's on until midnight
tonight, thank you!

1231
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:36,155
DC 101!

1232
01:06:43,864 --> 01:06:44,966
Mel?

1233
01:07:21,936 --> 01:07:22,971
Hey!

1234
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:30,945
It's alright!

1235
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,148
Her mom set up an account.

1236
01:07:35,182 --> 01:07:37,818
For Carter and

1237
01:07:38,853 --> 01:07:41,088
they were putting money into it.

1238
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,963
And I took all the money
and I spent it on the movie.

1239
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:53,701
<i>How did she find out?</i>

1240
01:07:57,771 --> 01:08:02,878
She wanted to go
and take out a sum.

1241
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:21,760
<i>Authorities report that
the strange death</i>

1242
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:23,062
<i>of a local man
leaves more questions</i>

1243
01:08:23,064 --> 01:08:24,763
<i>than answers this morning.</i>

1244
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,298
<i>Friends say that Feldman,</i>

1245
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,701
<i>a film student,
had been acting strangely.</i>

1246
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:30,902
<i>Yeah, he's been making this
movie with this...</i>

1247
01:08:34,442 --> 01:08:37,375
<i>The body was lying
on floor, smashed to pieces.</i>

1248
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:40,979
<i>Feldman's body had been found in the
cabinet, under the kitchen sink.</i>

1249
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:44,450
<i>This creature is coming and...</i>

1250
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:47,852
<i>At this time, authorities await
results of an autopsy.</i>

1251
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:06,839
Hopefully we have a record
with him this evening and, you know,

1252
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:10,776
figure out where he's been, if he's
giving us a call, obviously we're,

1253
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:15,313
you know, we're showing up there to shoot,
we're just filming this for posterity

1254
01:09:15,315 --> 01:09:17,184
- at this point.
- Yeah.

1255
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:21,286
I don't really think we're gonna
use much about this, to be honest.

1256
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:24,158
Sure, I agree!

1257
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:40,740
You want me to keep
rolling on this so that we have...

1258
01:09:40,742 --> 01:09:42,340
Just whatever you do.

1259
01:09:42,342 --> 01:09:44,375
I don't have
a lot of battery left.

1260
01:09:44,377 --> 01:09:46,180
If you're right about it.
Alright!

1261
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:49,083
Gavin!

1262
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:53,288
Hey, Gavin!

1263
01:09:57,425 --> 01:09:59,027
Gavin!

1264
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:03,329
I'm gonna stop
recording for a second.

1265
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:05,164
No, no,
just keep it rolling.

1266
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,031
No, what are we
recording here?

1267
01:10:07,033 --> 01:10:09,168
We're not doing
anything, I don't...

1268
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,269
Go talk to him or something,
man, this is getting...

1269
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:13,772
I don't even know
what to say to him!

1270
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:16,210
I don't know,
Erik, you're the director!

1271
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:22,583
Gavin!

1272
01:10:24,118 --> 01:10:26,755
Look, buddy, we can't help you
if you don't talk to us.

1273
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:29,522
It's not...

1274
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:31,960
Just when he gets
closer to you...

1275
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:35,197
It's when you get
closer to him...

1276
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:40,366
Wait, what are you
talking about?

1277
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:42,204
Butterfly kisses!

1278
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:48,139
We need to help
this guy, seriously.

1279
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:52,279
We call, we call his wife!

1280
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:58,284
We don't have her number. She changed her
number. I don't know what her new number is.

1281
01:10:58,286 --> 01:11:02,888
What about his, what about his mom-in-law?
Whatever her name was.

1282
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,322
I never had her number.

1283
01:11:04,324 --> 01:11:05,523
It worked through Amelia,

1284
01:11:05,525 --> 01:11:07,026
and the house is sold,

1285
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:08,764
so I don't even know
how to find her.

1286
01:11:10,163 --> 01:11:12,430
I don't know, I mean, I'm not...

1287
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:15,267
We're supposed to make it
a movie about him,

1288
01:11:15,269 --> 01:11:19,905
and I don't know how much, if this is our
responsibility, we're not, not his family.

1289
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:21,874
It is our responsibility now,
we've...

1290
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:23,008
We've taken him this far,

1291
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,309
we've kind of screwed him over

1292
01:11:24,311 --> 01:11:25,611
on a couple things!

1293
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:27,045
We haven't screwed him over,
Kenny!

1294
01:11:27,047 --> 01:11:28,446
But, DC 101 was total set up.

1295
01:11:28,448 --> 01:11:31,250
DC 101 who's not a total set up,
he agreed to it.

1296
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:35,888
He didn't know you were gonna have
Ed Sanchez call him. Come on!

1297
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,324
I did not put him
on the air to fail,

1298
01:11:38,326 --> 01:11:40,159
we gave him that option.

1299
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:42,894
Look, it was mutually exclusive,
mutually beneficial. We, we...

1300
01:11:42,896 --> 01:11:47,066
We needed an end to the movie, and he needed
a public forum through which to speak.

1301
01:11:47,068 --> 01:11:49,000
We agreed on this.

1302
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:50,902
How is that,
how is that my fault?

1303
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:53,405
- You guys, all said...
- You ruin his life for your movie,

1304
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:54,940
how about that?

1305
01:11:54,942 --> 01:11:56,342
At what point did this
become my movie

1306
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,143
and this became
I ruin somebody's life?

1307
01:11:58,145 --> 01:12:01,080
Man, you just keep pushing him.
You keep...

1308
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:03,549
Why do you guys, why do you
guys keep showing up

1309
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:06,117
with the gear and shooting,
what we're doing then?

1310
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:09,420
If you're so, if you have such
moral issues with it,

1311
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:11,223
why are you fucking here?

1312
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:13,358
- Who's that?
- What?

1313
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:17,228
Somebody's running
across the tracks.

1314
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,264
- Come on, guys.
- Shit!

1315
01:12:22,502 --> 01:12:25,169
Where is the camera?
Did he take the camera?

1316
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:34,248
Guys, slow down.

1317
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:43,391
- Did he seriously go in there?
- I'm not going in there.

1318
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:49,661
Guys! The camera battery
is getting low!

1319
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,696
We have to make a decision here.

1320
01:12:51,698 --> 01:12:53,197
Gavin!

1321
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:54,967
The camera is about to die,
Erik!

1322
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:56,238
What are we doing?

1323
01:12:57,971 --> 01:13:00,004
- What is that?
- What?

1324
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:02,309
- Who the fuck is that?
- Gavin!

1325
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:05,544
- Did you see?
- It's right there.

1326
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:08,414
- Did you see anything?
- I don't see anything!

1327
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:11,282
It's right in fucking the end of
the tunnel! What the fuck is...?

1328
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:16,958
Feldman sent this
the night that he died.

1329
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:21,593
As you can see, he details out
what he called the final plan.

1330
01:13:21,595 --> 01:13:25,164
At the end, he only had three blinks
left, so he set the camera up

1331
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:29,434
into a mirror, so he covered both sides,
the front and the back of himself.

1332
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:32,039
He crouched down
in front of the mirror

1333
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,508
and had this hammer ready,
so that on his final blink

1334
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:42,317
he could stop, he could stop him
from getting him, so he thought...

1335
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:47,686
Feldman's parents let me go over
and go through everything when

1336
01:13:47,688 --> 01:13:52,624
Feldman had passed, because we were
working on the project together.

1337
01:13:52,626 --> 01:13:58,062
I was able to get this tape which was
in the camera, up until the end.

1338
01:13:58,064 --> 01:14:01,467
As you can see, it's all cracked
up and the tape was unspooled,

1339
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:05,070
but I was actually able to put
it back together.

1340
01:14:05,072 --> 01:14:07,074
It took a few days,

1341
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:09,607
but I did it.

1342
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:12,510
The only thing that would
play, was the last clip,

1343
01:14:12,512 --> 01:14:15,350
and that's OK,
because Feldman was smart.

1344
01:14:16,117 --> 01:14:18,450
He also had this.

1345
01:14:50,384 --> 01:14:51,250
Ah!

1346
01:15:28,756 --> 01:15:33,791
Alright, so Andy, for the benefit
of the camera, can you please,

1347
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:37,131
can you please tell me what you
sent me in the email?

1348
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:41,834
<i>Well, what I found was,</i>

1349
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:47,238
<i>if you look when Peeping Tom
is jumping up,</i>

1350
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,179
<i>like jumping up
to grab Feldman...</i>

1351
01:15:52,712 --> 01:15:57,085
<i>If you look in his eye, there's
actually an image in his eye.</i>

1352
01:15:58,185 --> 01:16:03,254
<i>At first, I thought it was the shot
of the, like the Ilchester tunnel,</i>

1353
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:07,860
<i>like I thought it was like
a frame grab from the video</i>

1354
01:16:07,862 --> 01:16:10,595
<i>where he appeared, but</i>

1355
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:12,263
<i>I actually think it's the other
way around,</i>

1356
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:15,400
<i>like it's what Peeping Tom saw</i>

1357
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:16,802
<i>when Peeping Tom appeared</i>

1358
01:16:16,804 --> 01:16:19,470
<i>so he's looking through the
tunnel</i>

1359
01:16:19,472 --> 01:16:23,342
<i>and... you see the lights from
that camera</i>

1360
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:27,448
<i>and beyond that is like
the train bridge.</i>

1361
01:16:28,215 --> 01:16:32,483
OK, so this,
this is his POV

1362
01:16:32,485 --> 01:16:36,554
of Crane and Feldman filming
him the night...

1363
01:16:36,556 --> 01:16:40,094
<i>It's Peeping Tom's
point of view, yeah.</i>

1364
01:16:43,697 --> 01:16:45,632
Wow, ah...

1365
01:16:46,432 --> 01:16:48,933
So this is what
it sounds like by itself.

1366
01:16:50,703 --> 01:16:53,237
You wouldn't necessarily
be able to tell

1367
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,473
that that's Morse code,

1368
01:16:54,475 --> 01:16:55,941
but you can see that it looks

1369
01:16:55,943 --> 01:16:57,543
a hell of a lot like it.

1370
01:16:57,545 --> 01:17:00,512
So, we, last time we were
working with Gavin,

1371
01:17:00,514 --> 01:17:02,647
there was kind of some debate
over the sound

1372
01:17:02,649 --> 01:17:04,516
that we found
at the beginning of...

1373
01:17:04,518 --> 01:17:08,887
seems like each clip after
the bridge footage.

1374
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:14,192
Using this synthesizer sampler
from iZotope, called Iris,

1375
01:17:14,194 --> 01:17:18,530
you can basically feed it the sound
and it'll map out the frequencies

1376
01:17:18,532 --> 01:17:22,237
and amplitude of the sound
visually.

1377
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:28,773
So, when I called you
guys in here, I was actually

1378
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,943
thinking that Gavin would be
in here, as well.

1379
01:17:31,945 --> 01:17:35,347
He's the director and yeah, I would
have thought he would want to see this,

1380
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:38,450
it's pretty crazy,
kind of validates him, but...

1381
01:17:38,452 --> 01:17:40,588
Gavin have been missing
for nine days.

1382
01:17:41,555 --> 01:17:42,624
Huh!

1383
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:48,227
Alright, so, OK.
Are you rolling?

1384
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:50,262
- Yeah!
- OK, so, on the way over here,

1385
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:54,633
before I left this arrived in
the mail, this is from Gavin.

1386
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:56,968
I have not opened it up because
I wanted to wait until

1387
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:59,303
we do this on camera. Ready?

1388
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:02,342
- Yeah.
- OK. Alright.

1389
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,445
DVCAM.

1390
01:18:07,648 --> 01:18:10,585
- What is that?
- Holy shit!

1391
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,855
This is, this is...

1392
01:18:15,855 --> 01:18:18,656
Sophia Crane, this is from
the found footage.

1393
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:22,229
This is the package that
Feldman sent her.

1394
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:28,603
No kidding!

1395
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:31,736
This is...

1396
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:35,339
OK, alright, look,
either this is a prop or...

1397
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:37,411
Oh, fuck, how did he get this?

1398
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:43,382
Because that was the... and then the stuff
that Sophia found with the, you know,

1399
01:18:43,384 --> 01:18:45,851
she was like storyboard,
storyboard, concept art.

1400
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:48,519
- This is gotta be fake.
- Where is it coming from?

1401
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:51,322
- I don't know.
- I thought it was Gavin.

1402
01:18:51,324 --> 01:18:53,525
Gingo Corp's not even showing up
on the map,

1403
01:18:53,527 --> 01:18:55,727
anywhere in Maryland,
there's a Gringo Court!

1404
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:56,827
Coincidentally.

1405
01:18:56,829 --> 01:18:58,629
Of course,
it's the Ginkgo Court.

1406
01:18:58,631 --> 01:19:00,999
What the fuck is Gringo?
Because...

1407
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:04,835
Hey, look, I mean, sometimes they change
communities, they change the street names...

1408
01:19:04,837 --> 01:19:06,707
- Is anything else in there?
- Yeah.

1409
01:19:08,509 --> 01:19:14,812
See, here's his journal, so maybe it tells
what he's been doing for the past two weeks.

1410
01:19:14,814 --> 01:19:16,416
I don't know.

1411
01:19:19,052 --> 01:19:21,553
This is a motel key card.

1412
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:24,488
- Are you rolling?
- Yeah.

1413
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:34,066
A lot of survey by...
Fucking, what's going on?

1414
01:19:34,068 --> 01:19:35,570
Gavin!

1415
01:19:38,604 --> 01:19:40,942
Is the management guys still...

1416
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:45,811
Good, let's go in! I don't think
we should record in here.

1417
01:19:45,813 --> 01:19:48,080
We're not breaking in,
are we?

1418
01:19:48,082 --> 01:19:50,081
Yeah, right.

1419
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,351
Oh, shit!

1420
01:19:52,353 --> 01:19:54,385
Gavin!

1421
01:19:54,387 --> 01:19:57,054
Jesus, it's not good!
The hell is this?

1422
01:19:57,056 --> 01:19:58,623
- Kenny, Kenny!
- What?

1423
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:02,093
- The GoPro's on.
- Jesus!

1424
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:04,795
What you think he's doing?
What the fuck is this?

1425
01:20:04,797 --> 01:20:06,430
Recording it.

1426
01:20:06,432 --> 01:20:08,770
Here's his camera,
there's no card inside it.

1427
01:20:10,703 --> 01:20:13,875
Does anybody see the Panasonic,
the DVX?

1428
01:20:15,975 --> 01:20:17,478
The tapes?

1429
01:20:19,046 --> 01:20:20,845
Everything OK?

1430
01:20:20,847 --> 01:20:24,883
OK, cool. Put this in the car,
we'll take these with us.

1431
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:26,651
- Shit!
- OK.

1432
01:20:26,653 --> 01:20:30,821
Fuck, dude! Let's get
out of here! Let's go, let's go!

1433
01:20:30,823 --> 01:20:33,090
What's wrong?

1434
01:20:33,092 --> 01:20:35,527
I don't know, seriously!

1435
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:37,562
Oh, fuck, dude!

1436
01:20:37,564 --> 01:20:39,600
What is it, man,
what's in there?

1437
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,704
I suggest to start from
the beginning with what happened.

1438
01:20:44,738 --> 01:20:47,742
OK, so, we're making
a documentary.

1439
01:20:48,574 --> 01:20:49,876
Is that on?

1440
01:20:51,145 --> 01:20:52,910
Are you recording it?

1441
01:20:52,912 --> 01:20:55,546
- Yes.
- OK.

1442
01:20:55,548 --> 01:20:56,915
Go ahead.

1443
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:59,821
We're making
a documentary about

1444
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,454
the deceased.

1445
01:21:11,597 --> 01:21:13,432
Carl, where's the
footage?

1446
01:21:13,434 --> 01:21:15,500
Where are the tapes?

1447
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:16,971
In my car.

1448
01:21:18,704 --> 01:21:21,807
Do you think,
should we show the police

1449
01:21:21,809 --> 01:21:24,009
the footage on the camera and
everything?

1450
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:25,177
- No, no.
- Why not?

1451
01:21:25,179 --> 01:21:26,510
They might take it away.

1452
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:27,912
They'll take the tapes,

1453
01:21:27,914 --> 01:21:30,051
they want the tapes,
they need the tapes.

1454
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:33,117
The tapes, look, the tapes
in the shoebox

1455
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:35,719
have absolutely nothing to do
with what happened here.

1456
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:39,057
Nothing to do with it, and we already have
a real scene, we can use the footage.

1457
01:21:39,059 --> 01:21:41,660
I'm talking about the footage
on my camera that we just shot,

1458
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:43,061
shouldn't we show that
to the police?

1459
01:21:43,063 --> 01:21:44,763
Yeah, but, if we show that
to the police

1460
01:21:44,765 --> 01:21:46,498
it'll show that Carl found the
tapes

1461
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,801
and then they'll take the tapes.

1462
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:54,071
What do you think he was doing, all the GoPros
and all the camera stuff, like, what...

1463
01:21:54,073 --> 01:21:57,808
I don't know, I think the more important
question is who took the cards?

1464
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,044
Who? They're not
in the cameras...

1465
01:22:00,046 --> 01:22:04,081
- So we'll find out in ten years!
- What?

1466
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,487
That's when the footage
will be found!

1467
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:13,191
I went to bed early last night.

1468
01:22:13,193 --> 01:22:17,228
I was so tired, kind of like you are
right before you're getting sick.

1469
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:21,700
I dreamt I went to the tunnel
and I was staring down,

1470
01:22:21,702 --> 01:22:23,003
right at midnight.

1471
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:27,775
Everyone says it's so hard,
but I thought it was so easy.

1472
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:32,544
And when I stared for an hour,

1473
01:22:32,546 --> 01:22:33,681
he appeared

1474
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:38,586
and then I woke up and
I realized it wasn't a dream!

1475
01:22:39,552 --> 01:22:41,588
It's ten miles from my house

1476
01:22:42,855 --> 01:22:44,992
and I don't know
how I got there!

1477
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,527
Alright, I'll tell you about
this tunnel...

1478
01:22:49,529 --> 01:22:50,965
Oh, fuck!

1479
01:22:52,466 --> 01:22:56,735
Let's be honest here, this is not
what we thought this was going to be,

1480
01:22:56,737 --> 01:22:59,937
and now we're trying to make
something out of it.

1481
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:04,742
Listen, not all documentaries,
not all projects come together.

1482
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:09,281
This is one of those examples, it
just didn't, it didn't pan out.

1483
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:12,887
So you're saying we don't have a compelling
story to cut together here, we don't have...

1484
01:23:13,886 --> 01:23:19,657
There's, there's no end to this story other
than us standing here on the tracks.

1485
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:23,628
There's no end of this story because
it's all, this is the beginning.

1486
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,196
- You understand?
- What?

1487
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:27,031
We have the tapes, right?

1488
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:29,166
Then there's what
Studio Unknown found, OK?

1489
01:23:29,168 --> 01:23:31,736
They found that sound anomaly.

1490
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:33,905
We didn't put that there,
Gavin didn't put that there.

1491
01:23:33,907 --> 01:23:38,343
With what Wardlaw found, OK,
with the reflection in the eye,

1492
01:23:38,345 --> 01:23:40,911
and I don't know we put this
documentary out there

1493
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:42,947
and other people can take it
to the next step!

1494
01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:45,717
- This is just the beginning.
- You're contradicting yourself!

1495
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:49,153
- I'm not contradicting myself!
- You just said we're not trying

1496
01:23:49,155 --> 01:23:52,190
to present us like a real story, and now
you are trying to present it like this.

1497
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:56,827
I am trying to present this like the real
story of what happened to Gavin York.

1498
01:23:56,829 --> 01:23:58,897
And because we're trying to tell
Gavin's story,

1499
01:23:58,899 --> 01:24:02,800
these component factors that are
included in there are part of his story,

1500
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:04,068
part of what happened to him.

1501
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:05,202
I'm not saying it's real,

1502
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:06,804
I'm just saying that

1503
01:24:06,806 --> 01:24:11,076
what kind of a fucking idiot
just drops it!

1504
01:24:11,078 --> 01:24:14,048
Erik, do you believe
that the Blinkman is real?

1505
01:24:32,765 --> 01:24:36,267
My name is Sophia Crane.
It's March 3rd, 2004.

1506
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:39,370
I'm a film student
and this is my senior thesis.

1507
01:24:39,372 --> 01:24:41,772
I don't know how much longer
I'm going to be alive,

1508
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:43,273
so I ask whoever find this,

1509
01:24:43,275 --> 01:24:45,710
please apply the first and
second halves

1510
01:24:45,712 --> 01:24:47,111
of this final interview

1511
01:24:47,113 --> 01:24:49,347
to the beginning and
end of my film.

1512
01:24:49,349 --> 01:24:51,351
I don't know where
to make the cut.

1513
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:56,057
This is the story of Peeping Tom
and how I went looking for him.

1514
01:24:56,957 --> 01:24:59,760
Please show this to my parents.

1515
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:04,428
I don't know how much longer
I can go without blinking,

1516
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:07,699
but I think I found a way
to beat him.

1517
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:10,268
The girl who stared into the sun

1518
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:14,104
she only lost her sight,
she still had to blink.

1519
01:25:14,106 --> 01:25:15,940
Everyone blinks.

1520
01:25:15,942 --> 01:25:19,980
It's right here, taunting me,
try one last thing.

1521
01:25:35,095 --> 01:25:37,461
They say you can't cheat
Peeping Tom.

1522
01:25:37,463 --> 01:25:40,900
But I think I found the way to
beat him at his own game!
