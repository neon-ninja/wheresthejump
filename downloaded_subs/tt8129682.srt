2
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,490
Seven-fifty.

3
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,130
Is there no chance you can
spare us a dollar or two, huh?

4
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,035
Right.

5
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,542
How's your dad doing?

6
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,579
He's hanging in there.

7
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,533
Hey. Hey!

8
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,606
Do I know you?

9
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,509
Look at me like that again
like you did inside of there,

10
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,214
and I'll knock your fucking
lights out... China boy.

11
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:19,885
I'm Korean.

12
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,888
Same fucking thing to me.

13
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:24,790
All right. See you, man.

14
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,875
You think you're
better than me, don't you?

15
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,542
I saw the way you
looked at me back there.

16
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:47,079
No! No!

17
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:49,915
What are you,
some kind of computer whiz?

18
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:51,884
- I don't know...
- Shut the fuck up!

19
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,221
Yeah. You're all the same.

20
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,889
You flood into our
fucking country

21
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,157
and you take all of our jobs.

22
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:00,793
No, no, no...

23
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:11,137
You're a little rat,
aren't you?

24
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,539
Say it.

25
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,076
I'm a little rat.

26
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:18,643
Louder.

27
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:22,148
I'm a little rat.

28
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:24,950
Louder.

29
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,853
- Louder!
- I'm a little rat!

30
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,889
I'm... I'm a little rat.

31
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,126
Don't you ever come
back here again, rat.

32
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:22,374
What are you looking at?

33
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,094
Ah, Prasumas.

34
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:43,195
My favorite.

35
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,033
Johnny...

36
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,903
What happened to your face?

37
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,406
It's fine.

38
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,009
- Huh?
- I said it's fine.

39
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,212
Ay, Johnny, it's all...
You're bleeding.

40
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,686
Who did this to you?

41
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,290
Seriously, it isn't a big deal.

42
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,965
I should have been there.

43
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,801
I can take care of myself, Dad.

44
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:28,073
They're scared of you
because you're different.

45
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:31,177
But that's not your fault.

46
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:34,413
Different doesn't
mean you're bad.

47
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:35,915
I know.

48
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:01,974
Johnny, one day...

49
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,177
I won't be here
to look after you.

50
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,114
Who is looking after who?

51
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,855
You're not going anywhere.

52
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:05,904
Is this some kind of prank?

53
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,066
What...?

54
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,450
Crazy.

55
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:53,852
It's crazy.

56
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:38,864
Who is this?

57
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:40,566
<i>Friend.</i>

58
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,118
<i>I like your music.</i>

59
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,088
Is it?

60
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,289
It's kind of depressing.

61
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,062
<i>Sad but not mean.</i>

62
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:14,099
I guess.

63
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,637
<i>What is that?</i>

64
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,078
You can hear that?

65
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:27,446
<i>I hear certain sounds.</i>

66
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,552
<i>What's happening?</i>

67
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,688
Bad things.

68
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,293
<i>What do we do?</i>

69
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:47,099
Nothing.

70
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:52,271
We can't do anything.

71
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:00,946
Not our problem.

72
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:34,279
- Um, hello.
- <i>I can help.</i>

73
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:36,014
<i>But I need your help</i>

74
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,282
<i>and permission.</i>

75
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,253
What are you going to do?

76
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,156
<i>Stop the bad things.</i>

77
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,061
And, uh...

78
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:54,767
What kind of...
help do you need?

79
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,771
<i>I want to see through you.</i>

80
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:03,776
I don't get it.

81
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:07,079
<i>I want to be part
of your world.</i>

82
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:09,348
<i>The real world.</i>

83
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:11,350
<i>See. What do you see?</i>

84
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,489
Um...

85
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,593
Okay, okay.

86
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,747
No!

87
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,620
No. Please.
Help me, please.

88
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,335
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

89
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,270
<i>Hello?</i>

90
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:07,172
<i>Hello?</i>

91
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:15,514
Hey, rat!

92
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,820
What did I tell you, huh?

93
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:25,090
I told you not to come
around here anymore.

94
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:27,760
Didn't I, rat? Huh?

95
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:29,595
Don't call me that.

96
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:33,131
I'll call you whatever I want.

97
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,133
Someone else calls you
that nickname, right?

98
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:39,404
Oh. They don't know, do they?

99
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:40,606
Shut the fuck up.

100
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:44,911
Mommy went to jail when
Dirk was a little boy, huh?

101
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:46,879
Shut the fuck up.
Do you hear me?

102
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:49,348
When daddy gets lonely,
he gets drunk.

103
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,418
He must have hit you a little too
hard inside of your head, huh?

104
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:56,856
- Come on, Dirk.
- 'Cause now you're out picking on rats like me.

105
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,525
You know it's
really something.

106
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,796
All the shit you can find

107
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,564
when you dig
into someone's cell phone.

108
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:07,232
You my fucking shrink now?

109
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:08,266
<i>What's happening?</i>

110
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:09,769
Bad people.

111
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:11,169
Don't look at me like that.

112
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:14,874
- Stop.
- Don't fucking look to me like that.

113
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:16,441
<i>I want to help.</i>

114
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:18,276
Do it.

115
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:17,937
Mm...

116
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:23,976
These must be the best Prasumas yet.
They're so juicy.

117
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:27,914
They're so juicy.

118
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:30,883
I like when you're happy.

119
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,251
It makes me happy.

120
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:35,353
I can't always be happy.

121
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,925
I guess that this
will have to do.

122
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:46,866
Don't you have to get that?

123
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:56,876
What is it?

124
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,310
<i>You're punishing him.</i>

125
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:00,813
Sorry?

126
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,750
<i>Your father... it will spread
quickly and he will suffer.</i>

127
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:05,918
<i>You're punishing him.</i>

128
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:12,859
No.
He wants to be with me.

129
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:16,963
<i>You are the one causing this
pain but it didn't... like this.</i>

130
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:19,297
<i>Let me help.</i>

131
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:20,933
- No.
- <i>Let me help.</i>

132
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,567
Absolutely not.

133
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,436
<i>You sound like a bad man.</i>

134
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,672
I won't let you do this.

135
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,474
<i>I don't need your permission.</i>

136
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:37,516
Johnny!

137
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:39,018
Stay away
from anything connected.

138
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:42,955
Quick! We have
to get out of here.

139
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:44,356
We have to get out of here!

140
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,394
Oh, my God!

141
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,414
Shit.

142
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:31,570
No!

143
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,973
No, no, no.

144
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,074
Stay away from him!

145
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,578
I'll do anything.

146
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:40,847
Just don't hurt him.

147
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,950
<i>Find me another.</i>

148
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,990
Hey, how you doing back there?

149
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:25,490
Hm?

150
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:27,927
Hm?

151
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,695
Nice and comfy?

152
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,768
You don't say much
but you are great company.

153
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,240
Hello, Jonathan.

154
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,576
Where am I?

155
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,980
That is
everybody's first question.

156
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,148
Totally normal reaction.

157
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:59,617
The real question is,
where do we place you?

158
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:04,223
It says here that you are
good with computers.

159
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,058
You actually
build your own rigs.

160
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:07,960
I do, too.

161
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:11,596
In fact, I've actually built
one of my own right here.

162
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:13,265
I think you might appreciate it.
Would you like to go see it?

163
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:18,703
Right.

164
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:21,307
You know, somebody
with your skill set

165
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,809
could really rise the ranks
around here.

166
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:40,159
Interesting.

167
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,828
You know, reactions tell us
so much about the human mind.

168
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:47,733
For example...

169
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,938
you spitting in my face tells
me you tend to get bullied...

170
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:58,077
that you're not very good
at protecting yourself.

171
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:01,847
What does my reaction
tell you about me?

172
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:15,961
You know,
you look like somebody

173
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:17,897
who used to be here
a very long time ago.

174
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,068
Same disrespect.

175
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:26,005
Jones!

176
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,211
Our patient has
had a very long day.

177
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:33,846
Let's make sure
he feels at home.

178
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,281
Yes, sir.

179
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,315
Where to?

180
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:40,019
Block 10.

181
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,861
Campers!

182
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:58,104
Jonathan, I'd like you
to meet your new friends.

183
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,138
It's Johnny.

184
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,275
Are we being a little shy?

185
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,081
All right, allow me
to make the introductions.

186
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,650
Over here. This is Alma.

187
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,054
She's a little bit
of a crank pot. Stay clear.

188
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:17,289
This one is Emma.

189
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:21,093
Ignore her scar.
She can be very sweet... at times.

190
00:23:22,461 --> 00:23:23,661
Hi, Emma.

191
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:29,869
This is our mommy, Renee.

192
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,741
Pleasure.

193
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:39,011
And that cot right there
is designated for,

194
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,947
well, Sami.

195
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:43,415
She's getting ready
for her session.

196
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,985
Let's get him dressed.

197
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,420
I can't wait
to show you the lab.

198
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:12,978
It's funny, after so many
years of experimentation,

199
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:15,347
the solution is so simple.

200
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,483
Target receptors in the brain

201
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:20,119
by a homemade
cocktail designed by me

202
00:24:20,152 --> 00:24:23,822
that allows to extract
the sensation known as fear...

203
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,860
into an easily contained gas.

204
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:34,433
Please. I can't do it again.

205
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,468
They tend to get like this after
they've been here for a while.

206
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:40,306
You see this canister?

207
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:43,708
This is our future.

208
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,477
It holds the gas.

209
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,815
Sami, why don't you show
the new guy how it works?

210
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:55,020
All right, I'll help.

211
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:39,798
So, you're just gonna leave?

212
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,568
Harry, please, just stop.

213
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:44,403
It was a fucking accident.

214
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:46,238
- Shut the fuck up!
- Stop.

215
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:48,073
This is exactly why
I need to get away from you.

216
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:49,541
You're fucking twisted.

217
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:51,143
Harry, I didn't mean to.

218
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,878
Come on.
You know I didn't mean to...

219
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:55,214
Bullshit! You fucking used me.

220
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:57,583
Harry, please just wait...

221
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,551
Babe, babe, babe, come on.

222
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:01,120
Babe, look at me.
Look at me.

223
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:02,921
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

224
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:04,223
Babe, what about us?

225
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:05,524
- Hm? Come on.
- "Us"?

226
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,327
There was no fucking "us".

227
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,361
It was all about you.

228
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:14,867
How am I gonna do this?
I can't do this alone.

229
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,870
You should have fucking thought
about that before you did it, huh?

230
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:19,505
Come on. Let's just go back.
Everything will be fine.

231
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,106
I'm just freaking out
right now.

232
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,608
Come on. Let's just fucking go.

233
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,311
Get the fuck away from me,
you crazy fucking bitch!

234
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,421
What the fuck
are you looking at?

235
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:40,059
Fuck!

236
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:01,880
Fuck!

237
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,620
Fucking...

238
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:13,625
Fuck.

239
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,928
Fuck! Fuck!

240
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,264
Fuck.

241
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,607
Oh, shit!

242
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,991
Pick up the fucking phone.

243
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,426
<i>You know what to do.</i>

244
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:58,664
Fuck.

245
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:04,136
Fucking shit!

246
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,016
What the fuck?

247
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:22,354
Fuck.

248
00:29:24,156 --> 00:29:25,624
Fuck. What the fuck?

249
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,298
Fuck...

250
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,401
Fuck.

251
00:30:12,304 --> 00:30:13,338
<i>You know what to do.</i>

252
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:14,640
No.

253
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:36,823
Come on, baby.

254
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:45,430
Come on.

255
00:31:45,464 --> 00:31:47,265
Yeah.

256
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:32,644
Fuck!

257
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,283
Oh, my God.

258
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:14,787
We can finally
get a place.

259
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:19,357
Just you and I.

260
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:23,562
Maybe with a garage.

261
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:25,832
Where we can practice.

262
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,301
Maybe get that new guitar.

263
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:31,336
No shit.

264
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:38,677
I don't think they see him.

265
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,613
Every day at 6:00,
he takes a drawer to the bank.

266
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:43,983
Hey.

267
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:46,451
Just do what we talked about.

268
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:49,721
Everything will be fine.

269
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:56,394
No one gets hurt?

270
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:00,265
No one.

271
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,400
Just scare him a little.

272
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:06,839
He's an asshole,
but he's not stupid.

273
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:09,876
He'll give it up.

274
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,279
Ready?

275
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:16,015
You got this.

276
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,528
Hey, I'm right here.

277
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,697
Okay. You got this.

278
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,067
You fucking got this.

279
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,658
Give me the fucking money.

280
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:05,031
Over my dead body,
you little shit.

281
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:06,732
I'm not fucking
around with you!

282
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:07,733
Give me the fucking money.

283
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,803
You don't have the balls
to take my money, son.

284
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,886
Come on, Harry!

285
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:28,988
Fuck.

286
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:00,753
What the fuck
have you done?

287
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:04,090
Just shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

288
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:06,792
Open the fucking trunk.

289
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:08,160
Open the fucking trunk.

290
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:01,646
Yes. More.

291
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,818
That's good.

292
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:08,653
More.

293
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,163
Don't! Make it stop!

294
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:19,597
Damn it, Sami!

295
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,642
Well, at least we got some
of what we needed.

296
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:31,676
Get him out of here.

297
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:17,890
No! No! No!

298
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:22,128
Hey.

299
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:25,630
Hey, Emma. It's all right.
It's all right.

300
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:26,732
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

301
00:38:26,766 --> 00:38:27,933
There's nothing there.

302
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:31,103
What's going on?

303
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:32,972
Too many of those
fucking sessions.

304
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:34,807
I just want it to stop.

305
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,308
I just
wanna get some sleep.

306
00:38:36,342 --> 00:38:38,811
Hey,
keep your voice down.

307
00:38:38,844 --> 00:38:40,612
You don't want them to take
you back to the shrinker.

308
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:42,915
Why do they call it that?

309
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,285
Too many tests in it
shrinks your brain.

310
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:48,788
The more you talk about it,
the better you'll feel...

311
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,324
and the less
the machine will affect you.

312
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,711
- Hi, husband.
- <i>Wife.</i>

313
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,347
<i>How come
you're not asleep?</i>

314
00:39:15,381 --> 00:39:16,382
I don't know,

315
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:18,951
grading papers,
waiting for you.

316
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,220
<i>Yeah. Uh,
that's why I'm calling.</i>

317
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:24,056
<i>I gotta be here a little bit
later than I was thinking</i>

318
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,258
<i>to spend the night
at the office.</i>

319
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:28,094
<i>Come back and see you tomorrow?</i>

320
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:29,795
It's, like,
four nights in a row.

321
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,163
I'm starting to think
you're having an affair.

322
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,665
<i>Look,
I'll just come back in the morning.</i>

323
00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:34,867
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

324
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,002
<i>Take a break from grading.
They're middle schoolers.</i>

325
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:38,237
<i>How complex are they?</i>

326
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,005
You'd be surprised.

327
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,706
<i>I'll believe
when I see it.</i>

328
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,609
- <i>I love you.</i>
- Love you.

329
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:16,936
Hello?

330
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,272
Who is this?

331
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:25,277
Hello?

332
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:17,796
Hello?

333
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,945
Fuck.

334
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:33,872
Fuck.

335
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,976
Who the fuck is doing this?

336
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:40,245
Who's in my house?

337
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:43,248
Get out of my fucking house.
Get out of my fucking house!

338
00:43:59,164 --> 00:44:00,666
Hello?

339
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,185
Olly olly oxen free.

340
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,962
Damn, Blaire. Got her good.

341
00:44:29,995 --> 00:44:31,096
Fuck yeah, I did.

342
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:33,665
You see this?

343
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:36,902
Your sister's done good.

344
00:44:37,703 --> 00:44:38,971
Want to taste the blade?

345
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:43,709
How are we gonna do her?

346
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:46,245
Stab her
till she bleeds out, I guess.

347
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:47,646
Won't that be too much blood?

348
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:48,714
Yeah, Grady.

349
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:50,516
Bodies have blood in them.

350
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:52,451
So, yeah, she'll have a bit
more blood to come out.

351
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:56,688
Why are you doing this?
What are you doing here?

352
00:44:58,357 --> 00:44:59,491
Stop talking.

353
00:45:01,393 --> 00:45:02,528
I'll cut your lips off.

354
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:08,367
Isaac...

355
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:11,270
Hi, Miss Palmer.

356
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:14,206
- Isaac, don't look at her, man.
- No, Isaac, look at her.

357
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:17,176
I want everyone to look at her.

358
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:25,584
He's cute.

359
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:28,587
Real handsome.

360
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:32,090
Blaire, come on.

361
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,461
You like to fuck
married men, do you?

362
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:41,266
Would you like to fuck our dad?

363
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:43,469
Blaire, stop.

364
00:45:44,336 --> 00:45:46,171
I'm sorry.

365
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,776
I'm sorry.

366
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,276
Sorry for which part?

367
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:54,580
Fucking our dad?

368
00:45:56,648 --> 00:45:58,016
For ruining our family?

369
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:03,222
Why don't we just curb stomp
her outside and then...

370
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,256
stab her to death.

371
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:09,094
We can't just bring her outside
and curb stomp her, dumb shit.

372
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:10,730
Fuck. There's rocks
in your brains.

373
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:13,165
- Why not?
- 'Cause the neighbors will see.

374
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:15,133
No one's gonna see it.
They're all gonna be asleep...

375
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:32,718
You're one
clumsy bitch, Miss Palmer.

376
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:41,326
You coming?

377
00:46:44,797 --> 00:46:47,399
You want dad to be a fucking
punchline for the rest of his life?

378
00:46:50,235 --> 00:46:51,236
Let's go.

379
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:05,217
You kids don't think you're gonna
really get away with this, do you?

380
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,251
Shut up.

381
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:10,088
We're gonna do her or what?
I'm starving.

382
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:13,793
Strip.

383
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:17,329
What?

384
00:47:19,899 --> 00:47:21,667
Blaire, stop this.

385
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:45,825
I want you
to take off your clothes.

386
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:48,594
No.

387
00:47:50,362 --> 00:47:52,732
I'm sorry... what?

388
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:53,833
I'm not doing that.

389
00:47:57,169 --> 00:47:58,670
You're acting like
you have a choice.

390
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,240
Why?

391
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:09,448
'Cause we want some
foreplay before we kill you.

392
00:48:30,602 --> 00:48:32,304
Come on, Blaire.
That is enough.

393
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:34,239
Isaac, one more time...

394
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:52,591
Let me out.

395
00:48:52,624 --> 00:48:53,793
Calm down, calm down.

396
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:05,772
It was an accident.

397
00:49:06,973 --> 00:49:08,173
It was an accident.

398
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:11,543
It was an accident.

399
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:18,483
Shit, Blaire.
I think he's dead.

400
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:20,820
What the fuck did you do?

401
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:24,589
Help!

402
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:25,691
Help!

403
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:41,908
Get the fuck off me.

404
00:50:23,682 --> 00:50:26,351
911, I'd like
to report a murder.

405
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:38,363
We were just messing around.

406
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:40,933
But then she just snapped.

407
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:45,604
Stay right here. We'll make
sure you get home safely.

408
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:48,373
- Mom?
- Sweetheart.

409
00:50:48,406 --> 00:50:49,942
- Mom.
- It's okay.

410
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:53,813
I'm just freaking out.
What is going on?

411
00:50:59,618 --> 00:51:00,920
Get the hell away from me.

412
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:03,355
Okay, okay, okay.

413
00:51:03,388 --> 00:51:05,057
- Get away from me.
- Okay, okay, relax.

414
00:52:11,556 --> 00:52:12,691
Who's up first?

415
00:52:12,724 --> 00:52:13,725
Please let me see him.

416
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,428
- Okay.
- Now.

417
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:19,464
- Let's get you hooked up.
- In person.

418
00:52:24,036 --> 00:52:25,071
Please, he's so young.

419
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:30,042
I'll go instead.

420
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:32,677
Oh, I love volunteers.

421
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:39,118
But, sadly,
that's not how this works.

422
00:52:45,124 --> 00:52:46,125
Come on.

423
00:52:50,229 --> 00:52:52,131
Up you go. Yeah.

424
00:53:12,919 --> 00:53:14,220
Full cannister, please.

425
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,971
Clear.

426
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,588
Drop it. Put it down!

427
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:54,160
Clear.

428
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:55,861
Move. Get down on the ground.

429
00:53:58,731 --> 00:53:59,698
There's two in here.

430
00:53:59,732 --> 00:54:01,133
Put your hands
where I can see them.

431
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:03,468
Shut the fuck up.

432
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:06,806
No.

433
00:54:12,812 --> 00:54:13,813
Oh, shit.

434
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:18,583
- Come on.
- What the fuck, man.

435
00:54:18,616 --> 00:54:20,119
Hey, take him outside.

436
00:54:20,152 --> 00:54:21,153
- Get the rest.
- Clear.

437
00:54:48,214 --> 00:54:51,017
Take all the time you need,
all right?

438
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,918
I'm gonna go make sure
everything's in order.

439
00:55:04,696 --> 00:55:05,697
Let's go.

440
00:55:45,905 --> 00:55:46,972
Mama.

441
00:55:49,942 --> 00:55:51,844
Mr. B said I'm
sounding pretty good so far.

442
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:53,678
Yeah? Let me hear some.

443
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:56,015
Okay. This is the D
major scale.

444
00:56:13,232 --> 00:56:16,135
I can't believe
you just started lessons.

445
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,237
It is sounding so good.

446
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:20,272
Yeah. It's really hard.

447
00:56:20,306 --> 00:56:22,308
Oh, try it. Try it.

448
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,676
No. You know
I can't play anything.

449
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:27,079
- Oh, yes, you can.
- No, I don't even know how to hold it.

450
00:56:27,113 --> 00:56:30,082
Okay, so you put
this hand right here,

451
00:56:30,116 --> 00:56:33,419
and then you hold the bow
on the other hand,

452
00:56:33,452 --> 00:56:36,654
and then you put
the bow right there.

453
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:38,057
And yes.

454
00:56:39,992 --> 00:56:42,727
Why is it not making any sound?

455
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:46,765
Oh.

456
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,701
- I'm much better at singing.
- No, no, no, no.

457
00:56:49,735 --> 00:56:53,072
- What's wrong with my singing?
- You sing horrible.

458
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:11,924
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

459
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:22,935
Carlos, get down.

460
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:23,969
Down on the floor.

461
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,670
Carlos!

462
00:57:33,746 --> 00:57:36,115
Mama! Mama!

463
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:42,388
- Mama!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

464
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:43,789
It's okay, Mama.

465
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:51,463
I was playing with this and
I don't know what happened.

466
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:53,265
How many times
do I have to tell you

467
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:55,134
not to play
with this violent game?

468
00:57:56,068 --> 00:57:57,036
Huh?

469
00:57:57,069 --> 00:57:59,905
Who gave you this?
Who fucking gave you this?

470
00:58:00,806 --> 00:58:01,907
Chris let me borrow it.

471
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:04,944
Well, tomorrow at school
you take it right back to him.

472
00:58:04,977 --> 00:58:07,046
Okay? You hear me?

473
00:58:10,149 --> 00:58:11,417
- <i>Si?</i>
- <i>Si.</i>

474
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:25,164
<i>Perdon.</i>

475
00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:34,340
I got an idea.

476
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:37,443
Did you finish your homework?

477
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:40,779
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

478
00:58:43,015 --> 00:58:46,085
Why don't we go try this place
that Tia Arianne told us about?

479
00:58:48,354 --> 00:58:49,421
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

480
00:58:49,455 --> 00:58:50,856
- Okay.
- It sounds good.

481
00:58:50,889 --> 00:58:52,358
Yeah. Let's go.

482
00:59:04,203 --> 00:59:05,204
Mm.

483
00:59:06,138 --> 00:59:08,240
Looks so good but I'm so full.

484
00:59:08,274 --> 00:59:09,908
Well,
I can make you a bacon sandwich

485
00:59:09,942 --> 00:59:11,243
with the leftovers tomorrow.

486
00:59:11,277 --> 00:59:12,444
- That sound good?
- Mm-hm.

487
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:15,981
I'm gonna run to the restroom.
Stay right here.

488
00:59:16,015 --> 00:59:17,116
Okay.

489
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:25,791
Hi, there.
How's everything so far?

490
00:59:26,325 --> 00:59:27,493
Oh, so good.

491
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:28,961
You ready for me
to take anything?

492
00:59:28,994 --> 00:59:31,864
- Um, just these.
- All righty.

493
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:37,269
All right, buddy.
How about another milkshake?

494
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:38,871
It looks like
you finished this one.

495
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:40,906
Yeah. Quick
before my mom gets back.

496
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,328
- I forgot to tell you something.
- Mm-hm.

497
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:04,463
Mr. B said he entered our
music group into a talent show.

498
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:06,598
That's fun.

499
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:08,600
Where's it gonna be?

500
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:09,535
Well, he said here,

501
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:10,804
but if we win that round
and a couple more,

502
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:13,972
we can go to New York and
perform in front of everyone.

503
01:00:14,006 --> 01:00:15,574
We have to make
our own original song,

504
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:17,309
and we have to play our
instruments and everything.

505
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,079
Wow.

506
01:00:20,112 --> 01:00:21,380
That's... that's amazing.

507
01:00:23,182 --> 01:00:25,250
So you better
start practicing...

508
01:00:25,284 --> 01:00:28,020
Yeah, when we get home,
I'll practice them all.

509
01:00:28,053 --> 01:00:29,421
Have you been
to New York before?

510
01:00:31,223 --> 01:00:32,891
- Huh?
- Have you been to New York?

511
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:38,263
- Get down. Get down.
- What?

512
01:00:39,031 --> 01:00:40,265
Let's go.

513
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:41,934
Get down. Get down.

514
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:43,102
- What?
- Get out of here.

515
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,619
Come here. Come here.

516
01:01:30,282 --> 01:01:32,718
- Mama, Mama, stop it.
- Let go now!

517
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:34,553
Hey, stop,
don't touch her.

518
01:01:34,586 --> 01:01:36,955
You're insane.

519
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,457
- Mama! Don't touch her.
- Stop it.

520
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,093
- You can't put me away...
- We're gonna need you to...

521
01:01:41,126 --> 01:01:44,296
- Son, you need to calm down.
- Mama!

522
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,498
- Calm down.
- Carlos! Carlos!

523
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,334
- Mama.
- Carlos.

524
01:01:49,368 --> 01:01:52,070
Mama, Mama. Stop.

525
01:01:52,104 --> 01:01:54,706
- Let her go.
- Son, you need to calm down.

526
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:57,075
<i>...seized along
with a small amount of cocaine...</i>

527
01:02:24,636 --> 01:02:29,374
Thank God there's only so much they can
pull out of this dusty old brain of mine.

528
01:02:33,178 --> 01:02:34,346
Hey, come over here.

529
01:02:37,683 --> 01:02:38,684
Hey.

530
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:50,596
What do you want?

531
01:02:52,498 --> 01:02:53,699
A companion.

532
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:00,472
Not you. I just meant
in general.

533
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:03,175
Oh.

534
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,211
I want your teeth.

535
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:10,315
You'll hardly miss 'em.

536
01:03:12,317 --> 01:03:13,685
What the fuck? Go away from me.

537
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:19,391
Just messing with you.

538
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:22,060
You got a twisted cuspid.

539
01:03:23,228 --> 01:03:24,563
I can do way better than that.

540
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:27,666
They do that to your face?

541
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:29,769
No.

542
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:32,739
This is all my own doing.

543
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:36,275
Why?

544
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:38,310
Well...

545
01:03:39,311 --> 01:03:42,147
When you have a fear like mine,

546
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,615
you don't really have a choice.

547
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:55,294
You want to hear about
what happened to me?

548
01:03:58,798 --> 01:03:59,899
As you know, the Ronaldo Group

549
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:02,802
is the number one architecture
firm in the country.

550
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:04,837
And I've been their top guy
for over a year.

551
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:06,238
I just wanted to mix it up,
and, uh,

552
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:09,341
I don't think moving here to
Boucher would feel like a step back

553
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:11,510
since I get to work
with all these lovely ladies.

554
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:15,113
I mean women.

555
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,085
I mean female architects.

556
01:04:21,888 --> 01:04:23,488
Uh...

557
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:31,163
What's with the gloves?

558
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:35,567
Oh, I wear these while
I'm working on the models

559
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:37,703
and the office is always
so cold.

560
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:41,306
I've just been leaving them on.

561
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,341
Yeah.

562
01:04:43,642 --> 01:04:45,845
Thanks for coming
in such late notice.

563
01:04:46,712 --> 01:04:47,747
Mister...

564
01:04:48,748 --> 01:04:50,248
McNerney.

565
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:53,485
Yeah.

566
01:04:56,488 --> 01:04:57,522
- We'll be in touch.
- Yeah.

567
01:05:14,807 --> 01:05:16,308
Oh!

568
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:25,952
Yeah.

569
01:05:25,985 --> 01:05:27,754
<i>It's Mr. Boucher
on the other line for you.</i>

570
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:32,591
Put him through.

571
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:36,395
<i>This Steinhardt proposal
is a complete fucking disaster.</i>

572
01:05:36,428 --> 01:05:37,730
What's the problem?

573
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:39,766
<i>The calculations
were off six degrees</i>

574
01:05:39,799 --> 01:05:42,267
<i>and now half the roof
is in the ground.</i>

575
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,837
- What?
- <i>You heard me.</i>

576
01:05:46,371 --> 01:05:48,808
- Okay.
- <i>This isn't rocket science.</i>

577
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:51,543
<i>Get those girls' heads out
of their asses and fix it.</i>

578
01:05:51,576 --> 01:05:52,879
I'll take care of it
right away.

579
01:05:52,912 --> 01:05:56,381
<i>Jesus. You have no sense of
direction, just like your mother.</i>

580
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:00,585
Dad, this is the first
I'm hearing of it.

581
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:01,720
And I'm sorry.

582
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:14,633
<i>Yes, Ms. Boucher?</i>

583
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:16,803
I need everyone from
the Steinhardt team

584
01:06:16,836 --> 01:06:20,372
in the conference room with all
the project materials right away.

585
01:06:20,405 --> 01:06:21,640
<i>I'll send them right in.</i>

586
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:30,716
We have a serious problem.

587
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,618
We know. We hadn't anticipated the
Brocol group pulling this imminent...

588
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:36,421
I'm not talking about Brocol.

589
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:38,891
The foundation's
calculations are off.

590
01:06:38,925 --> 01:06:40,625
Uh, the surveyor reported...

591
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:43,295
I'm not talking
about boundary lines.

592
01:06:43,328 --> 01:06:46,631
- Our crew...
- I'm not talking about boundary lines.

593
01:06:46,665 --> 01:06:48,000
Our crew measured
multiple times.

594
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:53,305
What's gonna happen
to the roof

595
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:56,408
if the structure slopes

596
01:06:56,441 --> 01:07:01,881
an additional six degrees
toward the ground?

597
01:07:01,914 --> 01:07:03,615
We'll be that much closer
to Kevin Bacon?

598
01:07:07,385 --> 01:07:08,821
Get the fuck out of my office!

599
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:09,989
I was kidding.

600
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:11,958
Get the fuck out of my office!

601
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:13,059
It was a joke.

602
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:15,694
Get the fuck out of my office!

603
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:21,934
Um... the
measurements taken on May 16th

604
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:25,403
are congruent with the data
collected on June 3rd.

605
01:07:25,437 --> 01:07:27,672
And we made sure
to accompany the crew.

606
01:07:27,706 --> 01:07:29,942
And what were the findings?

607
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:32,477
Um, we did mark a discrepancy
in our numbers.

608
01:07:34,013 --> 01:07:36,381
Well, what matters now
is that we fix it.

609
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:39,351
I'm going home.

610
01:07:39,384 --> 01:07:43,455
I expect you there
with a plan in place.

611
01:07:43,488 --> 01:07:45,825
We'll stay up all night
if we have to.

612
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:47,692
No one rests
till this is resolved.

613
01:07:48,795 --> 01:07:49,896
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

614
01:07:50,662 --> 01:07:51,696
It went really well.

615
01:07:51,731 --> 01:07:53,565
I mean, I think we were
vibing a little bit, too.

616
01:07:53,598 --> 01:07:55,367
- That's great.
- Yeah.

617
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,637
I mean, you'd be the first guy
we've had in a while.

618
01:07:58,670 --> 01:07:59,671
That right?

619
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:02,607
Yeah. She likes her employees
young and pretty.

620
01:08:03,976 --> 01:08:05,912
Well, that explains
why you're here.

621
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:07,914
Um, but...

622
01:08:07,947 --> 01:08:09,816
you don't want to get
on her bad side.

623
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:14,386
One wrong move and
you're out of here.

624
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:17,722
Yeah. Excommunicated.

625
01:08:18,456 --> 01:08:20,725
Buried and never
heard from again.

626
01:08:21,961 --> 01:08:24,629
Mr. McNerney.
You're hired.

627
01:08:24,663 --> 01:08:26,565
Uh, wow. Um, thank you.

628
01:08:26,598 --> 01:08:29,634
Lia and Natalie will update you
in the conference room

629
01:08:29,668 --> 01:08:31,938
and I expect you three
at my house later tonight.

630
01:08:31,971 --> 01:08:33,840
Yeah. No, you got it.

631
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:35,574
Thank you again.

632
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:36,769
- Take your shoes off.
- Okay.

633
01:09:38,536 --> 01:09:40,940
Wow, groovy place.

634
01:09:41,741 --> 01:09:42,775
You still cold?

635
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:45,845
Yeah.

636
01:09:45,878 --> 01:09:47,545
Brr.

637
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:50,983
Do you mind if I put this down?

638
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:52,717
No, no, no.

639
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:55,121
Why don't you set it in here
on the coffee table?

640
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:56,789
You're gonna help yourselves
to something to eat,

641
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:57,957
and we're gonna get to work.

642
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,762
We think we found a solution.

643
01:10:02,795 --> 01:10:04,764
It might even cut our costs.

644
01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:09,862
I'm so sorry.

645
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:12,131
That's okay.
Stay right there, I'll get it.

646
01:11:12,798 --> 01:11:14,734
I can't...

647
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:06,452
- Gross.
- Oh.

648
01:17:06,485 --> 01:17:07,986
You're awake.

649
01:17:09,388 --> 01:17:10,656
Oh, goodie.

650
01:17:10,689 --> 01:17:13,292
I am so excited

651
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:15,461
to show you this
now that it's ready.

652
01:17:16,228 --> 01:17:18,063
It's time for
the maiden voyage.

653
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:20,966
Come on, Johnny. Get in.

654
01:17:22,668 --> 01:17:24,036
Get up!

655
01:17:28,974 --> 01:17:32,578
Let's go. We're gonna take this
for a little bit of spin.

656
01:17:33,545 --> 01:17:35,314
Stay!

657
01:17:39,385 --> 01:17:41,019
I'm not gonna be much help.

658
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:44,056
Why would you say that?

659
01:17:44,089 --> 01:17:46,158
I thought you would want
to be part of history.

660
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:47,960
Help!

661
01:17:50,596 --> 01:17:52,331
They're not gonna
help you, Johnny.

662
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:55,200
Help!

663
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:04,276
Your cooperation is greatly
appreciated, Johnny.

664
01:18:04,811 --> 01:18:06,145
Thank you very much.

665
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:12,351
- How's your dad going?
- He hanging in there.

666
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:21,960
<i>What are you
going to do?</i>

667
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:23,162
<i>Stop the bad things.</i>

668
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:26,131
Don't fucking
look at me like that.

669
01:18:27,734 --> 01:18:29,101
No!

670
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:31,570
<i>Find me another.</i>

671
01:18:46,318 --> 01:18:47,352
What the hell!

672
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:51,323
You tortured my father.

673
01:18:54,293 --> 01:18:56,395
And I have taken care of him
every single day

674
01:18:56,428 --> 01:18:58,330
since he came back
from this place.

675
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,035
Rot in hell.

676
01:19:07,506 --> 01:19:09,174
We need to get out
of this place.

677
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:22,654
Move, move!

678
01:19:35,768 --> 01:19:38,270
You all find a way out.
I'll stay with him.

679
01:19:38,303 --> 01:19:39,806
Where the fuck are we?

680
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:41,741
It's a government
testing facility.

681
01:19:41,774 --> 01:19:45,310
They've been using your fears to
infect and control the population.

682
01:19:46,378 --> 01:19:47,780
They're weaponizing fear?

683
01:19:47,814 --> 01:19:49,581
Against their our own country?

684
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:52,785
We need to get out of here.

685
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,092
I have an idea.

686
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:04,096
Go, go, go.

687
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:08,100
Dr. Wright!

688
01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:29,121
Get off of me!

689
01:20:31,824 --> 01:20:33,325
What... what is that?

690
01:20:33,358 --> 01:20:34,626
What's going on?

691
01:20:37,462 --> 01:20:39,164
Get off, get off!
Get him off!

692
01:20:44,603 --> 01:20:45,838
Get him off me!

693
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:15,290
