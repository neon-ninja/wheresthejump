1
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,474
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,893
<i>Sorry, I had to pee.</i>

3
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>As per usual.</i>

4
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,941
<i>Huh. I do? No, I don't.</i>

5
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>I do?</i>

6
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,655
<i>No, I don't know how to do my makeup,</i>

7
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,283
<i>because, uh,
I literally stabbed myself in the eye</i>

8
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,952
<i>like three times today when I was trying
to put my mascara on.</i>

9
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,204
<i>So... whoops.</i>

10
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,499
<i>Giggle, I would love for you
to do my makeup.</i>

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,167
<i>We could play.</i>

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,842
<i>FireMANdy, dragon, cut it out.</i>

13
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,512
<i>Come on, you guys are so annoying.
I hate your inside jokes.</i>

14
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,100
<i>You know, if you guys
don't get to the cumshow,</i>

15
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,768
<i>I'm just gonna have to go off cam</i>

16
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>and I'm gonna do it without you, so...</i>

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,032
<i>Nobody wants that, right?</i>

18
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>But really?</i>

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,944
<i>I need it, so hurry up.</i>

20
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,490
<i>Uh! Diggy, thank you.</i>

21
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,033
<i>All right.</i>

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
<i>Spanks.</i>

23
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,245
<i>Um...</i>

24
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,873
<i>One... Oof.</i>

25
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>Two...</i>

26
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,194
<i>Three. Oh, my God, my butt's gonna hurt.</i>

27
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,712
<i>Four.</i>

28
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,090
<i>And five.</i>

29
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,385
<i>And one for good luck.</i>

30
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,096
<i>Cut it out.</i>

31
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,724
<i>No more jokes.</i>

32
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,438
<i>Come on, guys. We are so close
to the cumshow, Tinker,</i>

33
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,857
<i>I'm waiting patiently.</i>

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,029
Barney!

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,822
Yellow log gets you bounces.

36
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Ready?

37
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,036
Huh, huh, huh...

38
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>What is that?</i>

39
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,366
<i>Nice, Dumpy.</i>

40
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,755
All right, two more.

41
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,424
<i>For you, Tiny.</i>

42
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,011
Oh, thank you, Carpie,
you're so sweet.

43
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,266
Oh, I love this song.

44
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,491
Oh, yes, Barney!

45
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:24,162
Finally. Okay. It's time to vote.

46
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,958
You guys get to pick which one
will fit me just right.

47
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,835
We have...

48
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,005
little baby bear, which is ten tokens.

49
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,716
<i>He looks like a bear.</i>

50
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,595
And then we have Momma Bear
for 20 tokens.

51
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,351
And then Big Papa Bear.

52
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:53,233
Bye, Can. Big Papa Bear is 50 tokens,

53
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,356
and I don't know what this thing
is gonna do, but...

54
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>We'll figure it out. Thank you, dumpty.</i>

55
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,075
<i>Okay, vote.</i>

56
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,124
Who will it be?

57
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,959
Hm.

58
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,713
Come on guys, choose one.

59
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,676
Get it together.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,480
Okay, seriously, dude, fuck off.

61
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,319
Goodbye. Anyway...

62
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,237
<i>What the hell?</i>

63
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,837
All right, dude, does this turn you on
while you jack it in your mom's basement?

64
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,594
<i>Do you guys see this?</i>

65
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,102
Carpy, come on.

66
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,861
<i>Fine.</i>

67
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,660
<i>Is this what you want?</i>

68
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,580
Hm?

69
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,753
Is it?

70
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,596
<i>I'll fucking do it.</i>

71
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,940
<i>Gotcha.</i>

72
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,633
Amazing. I think we really got 'em.

73
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,094
Look! We're 53.

74
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,180
We've worked so hard.

75
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,723
Aren't you excited?

76
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,060
Okay, you don't care.

77
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,047
Have a great night.

78
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,219
<i>Have a great night.</i>

79
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>Have a great night.</i>

80
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,269
<i>Zombie girl says goodnight.</i>

81
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,357
<i>Zombie girl says goodnight.</i>

82
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,032
Hey, Tink.

83
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,243
<i>How you feeling?</i>

84
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,662
This chickadee's at 53.

85
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,372
<i>- Yes, she is.</i>
- Yeah.

86
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,946
<i>I think asking you to cut up
your pussy was a nice touch.</i>

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,377
Oh, my gosh, yeah,
you really got the room riled up.

88
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,463
- You make such a good anonymous visitor.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

89
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,508
<i>- BarnacleBob seems to like it.</i>
- I know!

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,593
I think I finally caught my whale.

91
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,972
<i>I hope so. I just worry you might be
trying to make another girl jealous.</i>

92
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,516
I don't care. He's a huge tipper.

93
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,120
Tink, don't you want us to make
number one this year?

94
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,144
<i>Of course!</i>

95
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,773
<i>Sixty-five to 53, that has to be a record.</i>

96
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,402
<i>- You wanna take a nice bath, relax?</i>
- Sure.

97
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:51,781
Oh, tonight went so well! I told you
people are craving crazy shows.

98
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,284
<i>They are! Those guys get so nasty.</i>

99
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,995
Yeah. What the fuck was that?

100
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,415
<i>Are you kidding me? It was amazing.
It felt so real.</i>

101
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:05,045
Anyway, how was the job hunt?

102
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,714
<i>Oh... you know.</i>

103
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,508
Well, you're in IT.
I'm sure you'll find something.

104
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,677
<i>No, yeah, I guess you're right.
I've been looking</i>

105
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,013
<i>into maybe moving out of the state,
actually.</i>

106
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>- There's more opportunity, I guess.</i>
- Fuck.

107
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,059
Everyone's still online.
I should get back on.

108
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,766
<i>Give them a chance to miss you.</i>

109
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,811
Food!

110
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,067
Thank you.

111
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,072
<i>Oh! What's that?</i>

112
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,492
<i>- Looks fancy.</i>
- Sushi.

113
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,040
You know what, Tink? Um...

114
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,627
- I think I'm gonna go.
<i>- Why, my chickadee?</i>

115
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,296
<i>- Don't you wanna try the bubble bath?</i>
- No, I do, I do.

116
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,714
I, um...

117
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,384
I'm just really tired.

118
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,097
- You know, next time, I promise.
- Sorry, Tink.

119
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,519
<i>- Hey, sweetheart.</i>
- Barney!

120
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,269
Hi!

121
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,482
Did you like the show?
Number one, here I come!

122
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,805
<i>You're pretty wild, aren't you?</i>

123
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,944
Oh, you know it.

124
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,280
- But seriously, thank you.
<i>- Don't worry about it.</i>

125
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,118
<i>Princess X has been slacking off.
You snooze, you lose.</i>

126
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,579
I bet she's missing you
right now, huh?

127
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,999
<i>You look beautiful, even covered in blood.</i>

128
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,209
Mm!

129
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,505
You know, I was thinking
about getting in this bath.

130
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,966
<i>Don't let me stop you.</i>

131
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,849
- Aww, thanks, Barney.
<i>- Any time.</i>

132
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,228
Let's have some fun.

133
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,569
- Ow.
- Do you want a unibrow for your date?

134
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,908
I just don't understand why
you won't tell me his name.

135
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,870
Because you would just go
chasing after him yourself.

136
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,997
- You kidding?
- Mom?

137
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,125
I have no idea what hot knocks is,
so I just grabbed all of these.

138
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,627
Okay. What do you think?

139
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,046
Is my daughter a sweetheart,

140
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,549
or a red vixen?

141
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,095
Can I go now?

142
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,554
Sure.

143
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,932
- Thank you.
- Don't forget to pick up the folding table

144
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,517
- on your way home.
- Ugh. Fine.

145
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,436
It's for your birthday.

146
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,147
A little enthusiasm wouldn't kill you.

147
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,524
You're gonna be there, right, Alice?

148
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,901
- Alice.
- What?

149
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,404
- Saturday.
- Yeah. No, Jordan, I'll get it off.

150
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,532
That looks nice.

151
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,201
When can I see your new place?

152
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,453
I don't know. When I'm less busy.

153
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,277
I really wish you wouldn't do that.
It's not a good look.

154
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,435
Come on.

155
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,480
- Hey.
- Jordo, come here.

156
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,155
- So, guess what?
- What?

157
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,952
I... I slit my throat last night.

158
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,330
Holy shit.

159
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,624
- That's actually kinda cool.
- Thanks.

160
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,960
- Oh, it was fucking awesome.
- Dude.

161
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,587
Seriously, everybody in my room loved it.
It was just like...

162
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm like this fucking close
to breaking top 50. I can taste it.

163
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,551
Nice.

164
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,929
Thanks, Jordan.

165
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,308
Ahem.

166
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,853
Shut up. I'm gonna tell her.

167
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,937
Mm, okay.

168
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,524
I will. I just have to...

169
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,318
My ranking needs to be better.

170
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,028
Sure, okay.

171
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,409
- Wow, this is fun.
- Oh, okay.

172
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,451
Do you wanna see

173
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,161
- all of the dick pics I get?
- Oh, God.

174
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,706
Let's look through. Let's look at 'em.

175
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,292
- What are you looking at?
- Look at them all.

176
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,252
- They're just...
- She's texting a boy.

177
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,045
- Alice?
- Yeah.

178
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,505
Play hard to get.

179
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,631
Make 'em want it.

180
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,426
- Want it?
- Mom! Gross!

181
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,232
- What do you know...
- You're hurting me.

182
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,280
- Ah, no.
- about her date?

183
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,384
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Spill it!

184
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,960
Shit, sorry.

185
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,421
- Katie.
- Alice, hey.

186
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,673
I did not know you worked here.

187
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,635
You look so pretty.
Uh... Are you going out?

188
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,014
Oh, no, I just...
I'm having, like, a dinner thing.

189
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,727
So, how's... how's your life
and how's your family?

190
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,313
Oh, they're good. Jordan's turning 17

191
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,857
and we're having a party for him
on Saturday, so...

192
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,776
Cool.

193
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,196
Uh, actually, I need napkins.

194
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,441
- Could you show me where they are?
- Yeah, they're...

195
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,909
right this way.

196
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,174
So what have you been up to again?

197
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,295
Is everything okay?

198
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,381
You should come.

199
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,967
- Huh?
- To the party.

200
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,093
You should come.

201
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,972
- Jordan's party.
- I... I guess so, sure.

202
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,100
- Sure. Uh...
- Good. Great.

203
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,435
Napkins.

204
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,322
Oh! Oh, my God.

205
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,245
Diggie sent me homemade cookies.

206
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,289
<i>- Aw, sweet.</i>
- Isn't that sweet?

207
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,000
He's such a sweetheart.

208
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,919
Oh!

209
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,466
Oh, Fox, you are gonna like these.

210
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,093
- I will model them for you.
<i>- Okay.</i>

211
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,928
Ready?

212
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,015
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

213
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,601
Yeah, Diggie knows how to make me feel
like a lady.

214
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,478
<i>Mm-mm!</i>

215
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,230
So, um...

216
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,356
TINKERBOY
FGL VIDEO DECLINED

217
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Jesus.

218
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,241
I'm down to 55. How am I supposed
to hold my spot? Not sleep?

219
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,953
<i>I know. I cammed 70 hours this week
and my rank hasn't budged.</i>

220
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,747
Ugh. Baby's number one
and she doesn't even try.

221
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,541
She barely even knows her guys.

222
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,918
<i>I don't think Baby even registers rank.</i>

223
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,575
<i>She's on a whole 'nother level.</i>

224
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,797
Well, that's the level
that I need to be on.

225
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,507
<i>So let's do a cool show.</i>

226
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,844
<i>- They're popular.</i>
- No, I don't do public shows.

227
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,930
I don't tell my guys I love them
and I don't fake my orgasms.

228
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,056
My rules.

229
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,558
What about a, um...

230
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,935
a swap show?

231
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,981
You know, like, every 1,500 tokens,
we swap personalities.

232
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,192
<i>Hmm... Mm-mm.</i>

233
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,444
<i>No, I couldn't pull off
doing one of your crazy shows.</i>

234
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,819
Oh, well, thank you.

235
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,782
<i>What about a control show?
You would jump, like, 20 places, easy.</i>

236
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,035
<i>- And, we could do it from mine.</i>
- No.

237
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,288
Cam Girl Clubhouse is,
like, so far out of my way.

238
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,040
- I just...
<i>- Aaah.</i>

239
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,376
No, if we do it there...

240
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,380
<i>- No, no.</i>
- Yes.

241
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,384
Picture it. A control show on a Vibatron.

242
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,094
We would kill it.

243
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,180
<i>Oh, God, Vibratron is so extreme.</i>

244
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,473
<i>I don't wanna ride...</i>

245
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,141
No, no. I'll do it. I'll ride it.

246
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,893
<i>That shit destroys your clit.</i>

247
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,604
Really?

248
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>- Just trust me on this one.</i>
- Okay.

249
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,278
<i>Stop it!</i>

250
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,489
<i>- Is that better?
- Yeah.</i>

251
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,659
<i>Fucking idiot.</i>

252
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,371
<i>Major America,</i>

253
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,665
<i>can you even see what's...</i>

254
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,669
<i>It's dripping!</i>

255
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,051
<i>My cells are constantly changing, so my
water changes all the time, but most...</i>

256
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,053
<i>Her head...</i>

257
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,649
Aw, I <i>wanna come.</i>

258
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,569
<i>Hey, thanks, Boar.</i>

259
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,409
<i>Oh.</i>

260
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,202
<i>My pillow just stabbed me
with a feather.</i>

261
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,292
Go away, I'm studying.

262
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,014
<i>Hey, sweetheart, how are you?</i>

263
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,850
Good. Just planning tonight's show.
You coming?

264
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,559
<i>Maybe.</i>

265
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,812
<i>I wanna show you something.</i>

266
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,108
<i>- You like?</i>
- It's beautiful.

267
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,069
<i>Well, then it's yours.</i>

268
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,488
Barney, you're so good to me.

269
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,409
Hey, I hear you'll be
in my neck of the woods next week.

270
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,911
<i>Oh, yeah? You live near Princess?</i>

271
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:41,996
In the area.

272
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,874
I was thinking you might
wanna take me out.

273
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,333
<i>I might.</i>

274
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,461
<i>Where do you live?
I'll come pick you up.</i>

275
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,421
Oh, I'll meet you. Where are you staying?

276
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,590
<i>I'll be at the Royal Desert Lodge,
but you don't...</i>

277
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,760
Bye.

278
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,137
That was weird.

279
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,606
Leave me alone.

280
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,318
Eye on the prize, baby.

281
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
Top 50.

282
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,479
Hi, guys. Sorry, I had to pee.

283
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,548
Uh, Danger, yes, I did.

284
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,134
As you know, peeing really fast is,
like, my superpower.

285
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,764
<i>Oh, thank you, Danger.</i>

286
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,225
<i>What, are you trying to get me drunk? Hm?</i>

287
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,185
Cheers.

288
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,229
Who's ready to get
this date night started?

289
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,066
Tink, I know we're missing Humper, but
he's always late and we're hungry, right?

290
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,819
All right, let's eat.

291
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,156
<i>It's a little hard to cut.</i>

292
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,075
Oh, my God.

293
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,784
I'm trying!

294
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,705
I'm not just gonna bite it, Diggie.

295
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,331
<i>I'm a classy lady.</i>

296
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,333
I'm not some kind of barbarian.

297
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,085
Should I?

298
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,382
All right, I'll take a bite. Okay.

299
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,757
<i>This is what you want?</i>

300
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Oh, God.

301
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,225
Okay.

302
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,943
Thank you! Thank you, Apple.

303
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,485
<i>I do.</i>

304
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,613
<i>I'm not gonna eat with my hands.</i>

305
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,033
Don't be ridiculous.
All right, fine. One bite.

306
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,121
This is crazy.

307
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,334
What?

308
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,379
Oh, my God! 50! 50!

309
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,714
I made it!

310
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,012
Oh, my God. We did it. We fucking did it!

311
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,766
<i>Guys! Oh, my God, we've been waiting
so long for this.</i>

312
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,518
Thank you so much for all your help.
This has been...

313
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:10,936
so amazing.

314
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,897
I can't... I just...
I'm over the moon.

315
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,106
Thank you so much.

316
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,735
I know, Humper,
we've been trying for so long!

317
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,487
You guys are the best room ever.

318
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,447
Oh, my God, Carpie,

319
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,408
for you, yes, I will,
I will be eating with my hands.

320
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,078
Guys.

321
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,207
Guys, where are you going?
We're still eating.

322
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,251
We're celebrating!

323
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,046
Whoooo!

324
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,174
<i>We've been working so hard.</i>

325
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,598
Guys, again, thank you so much.

326
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,185
This has been so amazing.
I can't believe we finally hit it.

327
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,231
<i>Silly. It's one piece per rank.</i>

328
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,066
<i>No.</i>

329
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,363
<i>Lola has to drop ten places
if you want me naked.</i>

330
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,077
<i>Okay, five.</i>

331
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,329
This is so exciting.

332
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,706
Cheers. To top 50!

333
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,499
<i>No, wait,</i>

334
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:15,793
<i>- six.</i>
- Guys...

335
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,129
Welcome, anybody who just arrived,
we just hit top 50

336
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,422
for the first time ever!

337
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,549
<i>Top off.</i>

338
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,635
Oh!

339
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,763
I made us some dessert.

340
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,807
<i>- Come on, boys.</i>
- Apple pie,

341
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,934
- covered in confetti.
<i>- You like this?</i>

342
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:36,814
First person to tip 3,000 tokens gets
a twin pie sent straight to their house.

343
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,193
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

344
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,614
Thank you guys so much.

345
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,660
This is so amazing. I can't believe
we finally did it. We hit 50!

346
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,494
<i>Goodnight.</i>

347
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,585
<i>Aw, only nine places.</i>

348
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,670
<i>Better luck next time.</i>

349
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,964
<i>Thanks, boys.</i>

350
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,274
Hello.

351
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,236
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

352
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,115
- Tinker?
<i>- That was really, really low of Princess.</i>

353
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,909
<i>She's just so desperate.</i>

354
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,911
Tinker, why are you using this number?

355
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>It's for emergencies, right?</i>

356
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,374
<i>You haven't been answering
my FGL calls. I've been worried.</i>

357
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,209
Tinker, this is not okay.

358
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,338
- Did I see you at the store today?
<i>- Oh.</i>

359
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,133
<i>I... I... I got a job.</i>

360
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,886
<i>- I... I thought I told you...</i>
- You moved here?

361
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,055
<i>Well, no... I mean... yes.</i>

362
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,724
<i>I'm... I'm... I'm staying at,
uh, the Green Acres.</i>

363
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,101
<i>I'm looking
for something more permanent. Uh...</i>

364
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,020
Tinker, you can't just show up here.

365
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,813
<i>It's... No, it's a happy coincidence.</i>

366
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,067
<i>I... I didn't mean to worry you.</i>

367
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,984
Mission failure.

368
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,828
<i>What are you talking about?
I thought this...</i>

369
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,742
Fucking freefall.

370
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,047
<i>- Hey, Lola.</i>
- Hey, Fox.

371
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,297
<i>What's up?</i>

372
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,217
We're doing the show.

373
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,067
- Lola!
- Hey.

374
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,865
Dude, that suicide show was so amazing.

375
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,577
- You could seriously be the next Baby.
- Thank you.

376
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,372
You okay? You look a little tired.

377
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,458
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

378
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,254
Lola. Running late for your big show?

379
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,797
Fuck off.

380
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,591
Whoa! Wow.

381
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,593
What did I do?

382
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,346
Stripping just to kill my rank.

383
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,264
Come on.

384
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,309
I hear you've been cuddling up to Barney.

385
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,396
Well, it's not like
I asked him to be there.

386
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,982
- You did poach him from Baby, Princess.
- Mm.

387
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,818
- You're riding a Vibatron tonight.
- Yep.

388
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,864
You know, I have
a friend who lost all sensation

389
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,782
'cause she stayed on one of those
too long.

390
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,119
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

391
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,246
Don't worry about it. You'll be fine.

392
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,998
You're probably gonna have to fake it.

393
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,209
You ready to break one of your rules?

394
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,086
Lola!

395
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,588
- Hey.
- You're late.

396
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,797
I know.

397
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,132
- You ready?
- Yeah.

398
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,468
Bye.

399
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,428
- Bye.
- Bye.

400
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,595
Tonight, our people...

401
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,811
Gavin, you have to let the poor girl come.

402
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,355
Faster.

403
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,857
If you can Cumberbund me...

404
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,777
Oh! And, off!

405
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,739
Damn it, Pussy Magnet.
God, you guys are driving me crazy.

406
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,659
No, no, no, no. Keep it going, guys.

407
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,660
- Let's go.
- Come on!

408
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,456
- Barney.
- Barney.

409
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,416
Um... I don't know.

410
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,169
Oh, definitely.

411
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,629
- Hm? Mm-hm.
- Mm.

412
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,297
Ooh! We have a winner.

413
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,513
Oh!

414
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,431
Turn that thing back on.

415
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,267
Come on, you can do better!

416
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,150
I think we're going
for an epic withholding record.

417
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,235
Oh, my God.

418
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,861
Oh, my God, I'm gonna pass out.

419
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,998
What are you supposed to say?

420
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,375
Yee-ha.

421
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,587
- Oh, Barney wants to shut you up.
- Damn it, Barney.

422
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,754
Sorry, honey.

423
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,094
More speed. Get ready, honey.

424
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,978
Oh, my God, 47!

425
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,608
Thank you, thank you!

426
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,055
<i>Oh, no.</i>

427
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,016
<i>I think I got bubbles in my eye.</i>

428
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,684
<i>Aaah!</i>

429
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,519
<i>Can you go blind from bubbles?</i>

430
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,444
Hello?

431
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,499
Is someone there?

432
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,698
<i>...dying...</i>

433
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,497
<i>That's how I know...</i>

434
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,753
<i>Stop it!</i>

435
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,009
<i>Come on, you guys know how I live.</i>

436
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,968
<i>Hardcore.</i>

437
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,930
<i>On the edge.</i>

438
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,450
<i>Aw, Giggle, thank you.</i>

439
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,871
<i>Okay. So here's the game.</i>

440
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:59,459
<i>If you tip 50,
I pop Dolphin and turn him into a hat.</i>

441
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,878
<i>FGL customer support,
how can I help you?</i>

442
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,547
Hi, um...

443
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,298
<i>...fight another day.</i>

444
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:09,094
- I'm having some trouble with my account.
<i>- Okay. I'm gonna need your access code.</i>

445
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,764
- It's 1-1-3-8-7-1-2-3-7.
<i>- Oh, cute dolphin!</i>

446
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,850
- <i>Alice Ackerman.</i>
- Yeah, that's me.

447
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,102
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

448
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,440
Oh, I'm just like... I'm locked
out of my account and I think...

449
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,360
I think you guys are just, like,
replaying an old show or something.

450
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,321
<i>Hmm... I don't think that's possible.
We can't do that.</i>

451
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,991
Um... Can you just bring up my channel?

452
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,868
<i>Yes, I've got it up over here.</i>

453
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,996
Okay. Well, does it say it's live?

454
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,581
<i>That's what I'm seeing.</i>

455
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,500
Uh...

456
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,046
- Are you watching it right now?
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

457
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,885
Well, dude, is she on the fucking phone?

458
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,889
<i>I'm going to have to put you on hold.
I'll be right with you.</i>

459
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,479
Come on...

460
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,149
<i>Why would you wanna do that?</i>

461
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,569
<i>No, it's not. It's not me hiding...</i>

462
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,280
<i>- It's you guys. You're the killers.</i>
- Which...

463
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,426
<i>Hey, tonebug.</i>

464
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,369
<i>Are you gonna save Dolphin's life?</i>

465
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,040
- What the fuck?
<i>- Hi, Miss Ackerman.</i>

466
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,750
Uh, yeah, I'm here.

467
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,213
<i>The show's live and the performer
matches the ID on file, so...</i>

468
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,673
Can you just freeze the account
or something?

469
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,635
<i>You can disable the account
from your model control page.</i>

470
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,596
I can't disable the account
because I'm locked out.

471
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,722
So can you just...

472
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,599
do something?

473
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,852
<i>Let me escalate this
up to tier two support.</i>

474
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,687
<i>We'll get back to you shortly.</i>

475
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,205
<i>Can I help you with anything else today?</i>

476
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,943
- No. Thanks, I guess.
<i>- All righty.</i>

477
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,903
<i>Thank you for choosing Free Girls Live.</i>

478
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,035
<i>So, like, I'm literally going to burn
my house down</i>

479
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,204
<i>so a fireman will take pity on my ass,</i>

480
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,917
<i>and no, I want him to start my fire,
not put it out.</i>

481
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,170
<i>I just need to get fucked, you know?</i>

482
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,967
<i>Aw, thank you, Tink. You're the best.</i>

483
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,099
Shit.

484
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,232
<i>Aw, I'm all pruney now.
Look at my fingers.</i>

485
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,946
<i>I'm a wrinkle monster.</i>

486
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,160
<i>Hey, we have a new friend.</i>

487
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,705
<i>Hello, Teapot.</i>

488
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,498
<i>Welcome to my bath.</i>

489
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:47,895
Fuck.

490
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,025
<i>All right, who's next?</i>

491
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,196
<i>Guys, I have a seriously lonely looking
left tit over here.</i>

492
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,865
- This is so weird.
<i>- Who wants to claim it?</i>

493
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,284
- You think they're replaying a show?
- No.

494
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:05,246
<i>Guys, my ass is, like, prime real estate
right now.</i>

495
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,915
<i>Who wants to own my ass?</i>

496
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,001
- They do own all our footage. Maybe...
- It's a live show.

497
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,463
<i>Oh, my God, Tink!</i>

498
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,132
- Here, say something.
- Okay.

499
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,133
<i>All yours.</i>

500
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,472
- It's probably a glitch.
- No, I mean, here. I'll tip her.

501
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,641
<i>Hey.</i>

502
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,020
<i>Okay, um...</i>

503
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:30,939
<i>Orange?</i>

504
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,525
<i>Orange!</i>

505
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,568
That's so fucked.

506
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,405
<i>- Orange.</i>
- Is Princess here?

507
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,449
Yeah, she's...

508
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,451
Was she by her computer last night,
because...

509
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,578
I swear, if another white dude asks me
to get naked.

510
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,081
What part of non nude
can't you understand?

511
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,624
<i>Oh, my gosh, Papa.</i>

512
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,627
<i>Well, I told you that my PO box
is just, like...</i>

513
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,546
<i>not working anymore.</i>

514
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,256
<i>Buy things from my wish list</i>

515
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,059
<i>- and they'll get sent right to me.</i>
- Weird.

516
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,260
Yeah.

517
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,761
It is weird.

518
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,056
Considering I did a show here last night
and then this morning...

519
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,142
Lola, you need to chill for a sec.

520
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,685
- Did you call FGL?
- Yes!

521
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,811
And they weren't helpful.

522
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,273
Welcome to the internet.
Accounts get jacked.

523
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,358
Yeah, after I cammed here.

524
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:16,985
What are you even saying?

525
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,864
That she stole the password
from my computer,

526
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,909
found somebody who looks exactly like you,
convinced them to buy your account,

527
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:25,993
all in one night?

528
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,664
Honestly, if I was gonna through
all that trouble,

529
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,251
I'd probably try for someone
in the top... ten.

530
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,298
You know what? If I find out
that either of you were behind this...

531
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,381
Lola, baby.

532
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,718
It's time to go.

533
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,679
<i>Oh, Diggy!</i>

534
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,563
<i>FGL customer support,
how can I help you?</i>

535
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,357
Hi, yeah, I called yesterday about being
locked out of my account.

536
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,484
I'm looking for an update.

537
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,736
<i>Okay, I'm gonna need your access code.</i>

538
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,530
Yeah, it's 1-1-3-8-7-1-2-3-7.

539
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,824
<i>Can you repeat that, please?</i>

540
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,244
1-1-3-8-7-1-2-3-7.

541
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
Hello?

542
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,210
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm seeing that access code
is not valid.</i>

543
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,794
What?

544
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,464
<i>I'm seeing that access code is not valid.</i>

545
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,092
Okay. Well, can I talk to your supervisor,
please?

546
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,887
<i>Ma'am, you could be anyone.
Without a valid access code,</i>

547
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,681
<i>- I can't verify your identity.</i>
- Just let me back into my account.

548
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:32,227
My access code
is 1-1-3-8-7-1-2-3-7.

549
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,772
<i>I'm very sorry, but I'm showing
that access code is invalid.</i>

550
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,982
Fucking kidding me?
You guys take half of my money,

551
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,734
and you promise 24-hour tech support,

552
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,444
so why don't you do your job and fix it?

553
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,947
<i>I need to ask you to calm down.
You're acting hysterical.</i>

554
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,909
Listen to me, asshole, there's some girl
on my account made up to look like me,

555
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,162
- taking my money.
<i>- Ma'am, could you bring it down a notch?</i>

556
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,330
Fucker.

557
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,216
I've been calling you all day.

558
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,635
I was picking up Jordan's present.

559
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,261
You look terrible.

560
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,513
Thank you.

561
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,973
Can you wrap this for me?

562
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,977
- Sure.
- Thank you.

563
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
Wait!

564
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,982
A new lippy fixes everything.

565
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,942
Girls, what do you think?

566
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,987
No.

567
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,655
Hello.

568
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,660
I've got it.

569
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,332
Lola, you're beautiful today.

570
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:41,379
Uh, last night was so fun, I thought
I'd bring you some flowers to thank you.

571
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,339
Thank you.
What are you doing here, Tinker?

572
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,632
Arnold, please.

573
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,177
- Is that your mom? Can't wait to meet her.
- Now's not a good time.

574
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,056
But you told me last night.

575
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:56,102
You want me in real life.
You... you love me.

576
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,801
- so I thought that...
- I didn't talk to you last night.

577
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,861
Oh... Lola.

578
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,572
It's not supposed to happen like this.

579
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,656
Calm down.

580
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,366
Tell me what's wrong, and I will help.

581
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,953
We will talk about this later,
but right now, you need to go.

582
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,539
I will always be here for you.

583
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,087
Ooh, who is that?

584
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I don't know.

585
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:39,955
Shit!

586
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,630
Oh...

587
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,194
<i>Barney, I'm in a library.</i>

588
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,740
<i>Oh, my God. That's so naughty.</i>

589
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,661
<i>Dee...</i>

590
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,415
<i>Humper bought you a flash.
What should I show you?</i>

591
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,752
<i>Barney, control yourself.</i>

592
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:30,506
<i>All right. I'm gonna get
in so much trouble.</i>

593
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,555
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

594
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,183
<i>Let's go somewhere a little more private.</i>

595
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,059
<i>Okay.</i>

596
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,561
<i>Good.</i>

597
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,106
<i>Guys, this is crazy.</i>

598
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,690
<i>Okay.</i>

599
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,653
<i>Okay, where should we go?
This looks good.</i>

600
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,201
<i>Uh... OK.</i>

601
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,204
<i>You guys, this is so crazy.</i>

602
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,957
<i>Humper! I can't.</i>

603
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,627
<i>Oh, my God. You know what?</i>

604
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,213
<i>What the hell?</i>

605
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,465
<i>Make me famous.</i>

606
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,595
Ohh! I told you guys.

607
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,054
Holy shit, dude.

608
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,349
Hey.

609
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,519
Where's Jordan?

610
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,275
Guys, relax. I'm not gonna tell on you.

611
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,157
- What do you guys want?
- Wait, wait, wait.

612
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,577
Brendan, get in here.

613
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,288
Jordan.

614
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,626
Hey, Jordan!

615
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,586
Happy birthday.

616
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,547
Thanks.

617
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,342
Oh, hey, um... you're late.

618
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,428
Uh... I don't care.

619
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,515
Hey, Jordan, your sister wants you.

620
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,065
- You're here! Finally.
- Finally.

621
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,859
Lynne was telling us
you bought a house.

622
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,986
Well, she's renting and I told her
she should buy it

623
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,531
because, you know, I've been telling her
how important it is to invest.

624
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,950
What was the job again?

625
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,619
Uh, I'm in, like, web development.

626
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,663
Ooh. Sounds fancy. What kind?

627
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,668
Uh, it's just like, freelance,
sort of small businesses and stuff.

628
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:34,422
- She's going through an ambitious phase.
- It's a phase, you know.

629
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:37,842
We're both so entrepreneurial.
Katie, what's going on with you?

630
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,928
- Uh, actually, let's not talk about work.
- I'm with you.

631
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,889
Okay, fine, let's do the cake.

632
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,473
We should. I have to go soon.

633
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,226
No, it's your brother's birthday,
you can make time.

634
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,604
Jordan, get your friends.
We're doing the cake.

635
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,939
Um... You come here
and take a photo of me.

636
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,233
I wanna get my picture in this outfit.

637
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,194
On, camera, okay.

638
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,905
- Ahem.
- Okay, ready?

639
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,698
- Yeah.
- One, two, three.

640
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,784
- One more, let me get the boobs.
- OK, cool.

641
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,578
One, two, three.

642
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,247
- Cool. Nice one.
- Yeah.

643
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,999
Oh, God, I look so blotchy.

644
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,542
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.

645
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:12,919
Uh, let me fix it.

646
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,422
- You look great.
- Thanks.

647
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,924
- How's your mom?
- Alex, stop!

648
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,093
- What's going on?
- Jordan, what are you...

649
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:24,764
- Fucking stop!
- Jordan, language!

650
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,807
- Jordan, stop!
- Peter, what are you...

651
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,393
- Porn star!
- Fucking stop!

652
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,979
Your sister does porn.

653
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,355
Cut it out!

654
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,196
<i>I don't think
I've ever come that hard.</i>

655
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,616
<i>I have always wanted to do that.
It felt like...</i>

656
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,243
Can you turn that off?

657
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:50,248
<i>I'm so good at my job.
I love each and every one...</i>

658
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,763
Mom.

659
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,146
I was gonna tell you, okay?

660
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,399
I didn't know how,
I didn't know how to...

661
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,401
We're doing the cake.

662
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,837
<i>Lift, and lift!</i>

663
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,215
<i>And lift, and lift! Now squats.</i>

664
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,427
<i>Whoo! Feel that burn.</i>

665
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,555
<i>Oh, I am so sweaty.</i>

666
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,851
<i>Come on, Giggle, I'm so tired.</i>

667
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,728
<i>All right, let's...</i>

668
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,314
<i>pull, pull...</i>

669
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,065
<i>Pull, pull... Oh!</i>

670
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,943
<i>Barney, you are my life saver,
thank you.</i>

671
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,740
<i>These last few shows have been
so amazing.</i>

672
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,327
<i>I'm, like, so proud of you guys.
You really brought the fire.</i>

673
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,704
<i>Aww.</i>

674
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,333
<i>Guys, thank you so much.
That's so sweet.</i>

675
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,961
<i>All right.</i>

676
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,130
<i>Who's ready to kick my ass?</i>

677
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,590
<i>Giggle!</i>

678
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,217
<i>Step, touch, step, touch,</i>

679
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,387
<i>step, touch, step, touch, step, touch...</i>

680
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,515
<i>Tou...</i>

681
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,893
<i>All right, time for spanks.</i>

682
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:35,769
<i>And...</i>

683
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,270
<i>one.</i>

684
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,776
<i>Two. Oh, that one hurt.</i>

685
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,195
<i>Let's do, three.</i>

686
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,157
<i>Four. Oh, my...</i>

687
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,912
<i>Okay. This what you're lookin' for?</i>

688
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,875
<i>Five. Ow. Six.</i>

689
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,630
<i>Seven. Ow. Teapot, you're
gonna make me bruise.</i>

690
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,758
<i>Eight.</i>

691
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,468
<i>Nine. Oh, my God.</i>

692
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,470
<i>And one more, one more.</i>

693
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,180
<i>Ten.</i>

694
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,977
<i>All right, Teapot.</i>

695
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,231
<i>Ready?</i>

696
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,028
<i>One. Ow!</i>

697
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,613
<i>Two.</i>

698
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,782
<i>Three.</i>

699
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,284
<i>Four. Ow.</i>

700
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,621
<i>Five. Oh, that was a good one.</i>

701
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,498
<i>Six. Ooh!</i>

702
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,417
<i>Seven.</i>

703
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,378
<i>Eight. Oh! Nine.</i>

704
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,088
<i>And ten.</i>

705
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,719
<i>Oh, you guys wanna break me, huh?</i>

706
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:58,018
<i>Let's see what we have in here.</i>

707
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,563
<i>My big old box of fun.</i>

708
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,900
<i>Handcuffs.</i>

709
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,945
<i>Oh, I have my choke collar. Hm?</i>

710
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,281
<i>And...</i>

711
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,365
<i>Oh.</i>

712
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,494
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

713
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,914
<i>Do you wanna see?</i>

714
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,375
<i>I don't know.</i>

715
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,883
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

716
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,676
<i>Hmm.</i>

717
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,263
<i>What is this doing here?</i>

718
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,184
<i>How about...</i>

719
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,479
<i>Three thousand for me to lick it?</i>

720
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,440
<i>Oh, Barney.</i>

721
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,033
<i>Ten thousand?</i>

722
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,952
<i>For me to suck it?</i>

723
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,298
<i>How about...</i>

724
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,384
<i>Fifty thousand for me to load it?</i>

725
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,720
<i>Anybody?</i>

726
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,015
<i>You like this?</i>

727
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,142
<i>Show me how much.</i>

728
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,981
<i>How about...</i>

729
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,944
<i>Hundred thousand for me
to make it explode?</i>

730
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,577
<i>Oh, come on, guys, isn't this fun?</i>

731
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,123
<i>We're so close.</i>

732
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,918
<i>Only 30,000 to go.</i>

733
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,508
<i>Humper, you did it! I love you.</i>

734
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,996
Fuck. Fuck.

735
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,500
<i>Top 20!</i>

736
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,170
<i>Top 20!</i>

737
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,756
<i>Top 20!</i>

738
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,218
<i>Guys, we did it! We did it.</i>

739
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,720
<i>Top 20!</i>

740
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,556
<i>Yeah, we did it.</i>

741
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,641
<i>We did it!</i>

742
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:47,062
<i>Hi, I'm either at the salon
or doing something fabulous.</i>

743
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,897
<i>Leave a message. Ciao.</i>

744
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,776
<i>Top 20! I can't believe it!</i>

745
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,489
- You've spoken with this website?
- Yes!

746
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:58,573
And they did nothing.

747
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,493
I don't know how to be any more clear.

748
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,538
She's online pretending to be me.

749
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,497
Can I just show you?

750
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,375
Yeah, yeah, pull it up.

751
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,189
Please, you need to do something.

752
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,775
<i>70-25, code six, 104 North Avenue.</i>

753
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,027
Copy. I gotta step outside.

754
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:41,283
- Look, this is my life. This is my job.
- I'm not understanding how this works.

755
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:43,952
What do you mean?

756
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,372
This show that you do, you...

757
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:51,710
You get paid by the minute or you have to
do anything that they want you to do?

758
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,589
No, I just... If I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.

759
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,425
What's the weirdest thing
that you've ever had to do? Come on.

760
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,388
Do you ever meet up with these men
in person?

761
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,266
Sometimes, yeah.

762
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,686
Do you ever engage in sexual activity
with them?

763
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,483
No, I don't.

764
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:16,735
That's a shame.

765
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,028
- Excuse me?
- Hey,

766
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:19,904
it's a compliment.

767
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,406
Hah!

768
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,326
- Rells, we gotta go.
- What, so you're not going to help me?

769
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,371
If you don't wanna see stuff like this,
stay off the internet.

770
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,083
Un-fucking-believable.

771
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,020
<i>No, guys, I said you have to guess, silly.</i>

772
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,064
<i>Okay.</i>

773
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,398
<i>It's...</i>

774
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,402
<i>BabyGirl.</i>

775
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:02,489
<i>At long last. I just have one question.</i>

776
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,118
<i>What are you guys gonna make her
do to me? Because I...</i>

777
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,369
Fuck.

778
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,758
<i>Oh, Gatsby I'm so excited.</i>

779
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:25,220
<i>I've been wanting to get my hands
on Lola since forever.</i>

780
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,146
<i>Her skin looks so soft.
I can't wait to touch it.</i>

781
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:47,618
<i>I haven't fucked in so long,
I'm going crazy. I'm serious.</i>

782
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,242
<i>I was literally thinking about
burning my house down</i>

783
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,706
<i>just so a fireman
would take pity on me.</i>

784
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,835
<i>Well, yes.</i>

785
00:54:56,919 --> 00:55:01,548
<i>Lola can start my fire, not put it out.</i>

786
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,968
<i>I just need to be fucked, you know?</i>

787
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,363
<i>...this job and, um...</i>

788
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,198
<i>Okay, let's spin it.</i>

789
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,577
<i>I did this weird thing where I was blonde
on top and then I had brown ha...</i>

790
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,101
<i>...little I used to try to think
about Santa Claus before I...</i>

791
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,666
<i>I made it blue because you guys
are always...</i>

792
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:39,127
<i>...burn my house down so a fireman
will take pity on my ass.</i>

793
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:43,757
<i>I know. I want him
to start my fire, not put it out.</i>

794
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,137
<i>I just need to get fucked, you know?</i>

795
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,272
Hey, Fox.

796
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,786
<i>Hey, we're about to start the Camothon,
are you gonna watch? It's...</i>

797
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,485
<i>Fox? Is this yours?</i>

798
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,362
Look, I just need to know,

799
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,366
like, Baby's first name,
or where she lives or something.

800
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,327
<i>What? Aren't you
doing a show with her tomorrow?</i>

801
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,389
- Please, Fox, this isn't gonna...
<i>- Fox!</i>

802
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,164
<i>Look, I'll ask around.</i>

803
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,808
- <i>Two minutes.
- Gotta go.</i>

804
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,792
Fuck.

805
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,714
What?

806
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,583
Lola!

807
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,542
Barney!

808
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,631
Oh, it is so, so good to see you.

809
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,549
- Oh!
- You too.

810
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,801
Mm. Mm. Mm!

811
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,387
Boy, last night's show... mwah!

812
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,805
Perfection.

813
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,683
- These suicides keep gettin' better.
- Thank you.

814
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,853
I have a couple of presents in my room,
if you wanna look.

815
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,357
Actually, what was that place you were
telling me about? I'm kinda hungry.

816
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,735
Well, your wish is my command.

817
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,617
<i>Hola, buenas tardes.</i>

818
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,911
My name is Justin
and I'll be taking care of you.

819
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,331
Yeah, let me get a club soda, and let's
get the, uh, guacamole cheese tower.

820
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,750
I'm just gonna stick with water.

821
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,837
Sure, that's okay. I'll be right back
with the guacamole <i>queso sorpreso.</i>

822
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:46,921
Yeah.

823
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,341
Should've gotten a drink.

824
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,218
I'm driving.

825
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,346
Anyway, let me tell you about Miami.

826
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:58,308
I won that date raffle, with Sarah Bear
and Blossom, but only Blossom showed up.

827
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,810
Oh, I love Blossom.

828
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,937
Sarah didn't call or anything.
It's like she forgot.

829
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,147
I'm the guy that decides
if you rank or not.

830
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,899
Last date raffle I enter.

831
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,194
Well, you just save those tips for me.

832
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:14,658
See, I like you. You're smart.
You get it.

833
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,159
Mm. Thank you.

834
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,745
I'd say you were my favorite, but, uh...

835
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,456
- I don't pick favorites.
- Hm.

836
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,209
Guacamole <i>queso sorpreso.</i>

837
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:28,714
- And do you know what you want for lunch?
- Let me get the Big Boy Burrito Bowl,

838
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,883
no sour cream, no cheese, no beans.

839
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,260
- No beans?
- No beans.

840
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:34,927
Um...

841
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,723
I'll have a veggie chimichanga.

842
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,392
Ah, the cheesychita chimichanga.
<i>Que bueno.</i>

843
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,603
Hm!

844
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,314
- I love the authenticity.
- It's quirky.

845
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,446
So, you know Baby pretty well, huh?

846
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,407
How do you think she got to the top ten?

847
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,992
Oh! Of course.

848
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,370
I'm just kind of nervous
about my show with her.

849
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:03,749
You know, she's staying at mine,
but I've never even met her.

850
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,793
- And she's driving.
- Driving?

851
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,337
That's a long way from Georgia.

852
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:10,922
I mean, she's...

853
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,676
so glamorous,
I thought she would be flying first class.

854
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,514
I see right through the glitz.

855
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,559
Prom queen's the most glamorous
thing she's ever done.

856
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:28,315
Underneath, she really just wants to know
that she can get a guy... like me.

857
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,445
So you know her... pretty well, yeah?

858
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,489
Oh, honey, I've been to her house.

859
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,867
Look what we, uh, found in her town.

860
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,411
Oh!

861
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,829
That is cute.

862
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,040
- What can I say? You girls love me.
- Mm-hm.

863
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,294
I'm gonna use the ladies' room.

864
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,545
Okay.

865
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:24,996
<i>Oh, we're getting ready.</i>

866
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,709
<i>Oh! I know, I am so excited.</i>

867
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,462
<i>A show with Baby has been my dream
since forever.</i>

868
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:36,591
<i>I hope we can get her to kiss me
everywhere.</i>

869
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,064
<i>Yellow is not my color.</i>

870
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,317
<i>Hm. Why not this one?</i>

871
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,112
- Lola?
<i>- I just love how pretty that is.</i>

872
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,281
<i>Barney sent...</i>

873
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:02,284
You know, I think your, uh, feed
is all messed up.

874
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,412
<i>Barney?
Do you want me to wear this tonight?</i>

875
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,707
How could my Lola be online at home

876
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,209
when she's on a date with me?

877
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,464
That's a cute picture, Lola.

878
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,594
Wanna show me those little cat ears?

879
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,181
No?

880
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,184
Barney, this is the women's bathroom.

881
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,770
So? Anybody else here?

882
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,484
What, you think you're the first girl
who's tried to scam me?

883
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,362
You're always in it for something.

884
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,033
Drugs, money, clothes.

885
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:47,037
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

886
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,081
You tell me who you are,
and maybe we can still have some fun.

887
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,127
Excuse me, is someone in here?

888
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,591
Geez, come here! Hey.

889
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,219
Hey! Let go! Let go!

890
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,222
Is everything okay?

891
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,229
Listen, I... I apologize.
My wife does not feel well at all.

892
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:15,082
You know, the young ones can't hold
their liquor. It's okay, she'll...

893
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,316
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

894
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,026
Come on, come on, let's go,
here we go.

895
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,654
All right, all right. Here we go.

896
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,989
Ow! Son of a...

897
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,806
<i>So, boys, what's it gonna be?</i>

898
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,725
<i>Are you gonna let me kiss her?</i>

899
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:54,145
<i>Ooh, yeah, her lips are so soft.</i>

900
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,650
<i>- It's getting hot and steamy in here.
- Thank you, Conquer.</i>

901
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,320
<i>Oh, my God, she's making me so hot.</i>

902
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,706
- <i>We don't have all night here.
- No.</i>

903
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,118
<i>We're a little impatient. Mm.</i>

904
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,871
<i>Oh, I'm so ready, what are we doing?</i>

905
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,750
<i>- Actually, you know what we should do?
- What?</i>

906
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,509
<i>- Ooh, you make it sound so mysterious.
- No, not mysterious.</i>

907
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,387
<i>- Let's go.
- They're so excited.</i>

908
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,722
<i>They're so excited.</i>

909
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,598
<i>So jealous,
they don't know what's going on.</i>

910
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:34,102
<i>- Guys, you're just gonna love this.
- Tough luck!</i>

911
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,024
<i>- I'm taking her away.
- Mm, yay!</i>

912
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,946
<i>Here we go.</i>

913
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:47,949
<i>Out of the pink room. Mm!</i>

914
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,287
<i>Ooh, it's gonna be exciting.</i>

915
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,247
<i>I'm walking in this top.</i>

916
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,047
<i>Here's my hallway.</i>

917
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,507
<i>Those are my boxes.</i>

918
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:05,884
<i>I just moved in.</i>

919
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,554
<i>Ooh.</i>

920
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:12,724
<i>My guys have never seen
my real bedroom before.</i>

921
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,226
<i>Shall we go in?</i>

922
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,438
<i>Here's the door. Moment of truth.</i>

923
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,107
No, no, no! No!

924
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,400
No!

925
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:24,152
<i>Wow!</i>

926
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,530
- Get the fuck out of my house!
<i>- This is my bedroom.</i>

927
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,115
Get the fuck out!

928
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,951
<i>That's my bed that I sleep in
every night.</i>

929
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:35,497
<i>You are so adorable.</i>

930
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,999
<i>Stop it, I was so awkward.</i>

931
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,335
<i>- I was so awkward.
- So hot.</i>

932
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,838
<i>Who's this? Who's this dude?</i>

933
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:47,467
<i>Um, no. That is my little brother. Gross.</i>

934
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:51,179
<i>Look. Jordan.</i>

935
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,517
Fuck you!

936
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,462
I guess people still think you live here.

937
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,464
Hey.

938
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,969
I saw a... house, so I'll...

939
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:17,140
pay for it, or paint it myself.

940
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:25,815
Mom, I wanted to tell you.

941
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,860
I just wanted to wait until I was...

942
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,196
in the top ten, you know,
until I was good enough.

943
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,823
You are really good.

944
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,075
Huh? What does that mean?

945
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,831
I watched a little.

946
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:48,630
- Oh, you can't be serious.
- I... I had to see.

947
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,339
And you were good.

948
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,384
I was?

949
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,223
Those guys love you.
You're so put together.

950
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,103
I get you in pajamas, and bratty and bored
and biting your nails.

951
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,980
But on that show,
you're a different person.

952
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,144
Confident. I wish everybody
could see you like that.

953
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:11,986
- Mom, that person is not me.
- And I'm not sad and pathetic.

954
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:16,282
I'm enlightened, I understand
this whole female empowerment thing.

955
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,160
No, Mom, that's not even what it's about.
That person is not me.

956
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,830
- I get it. It's a performance.
- No, Mom, you're not listening to me.

957
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,959
I'll have to show you, okay?

958
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:30,254
Look.

959
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,886
Shit.

960
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:43,184
- She's not online right now.
- Who's not online?

961
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,145
- I don't know. I don't know!
- Stop.

962
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,106
Just stop.

963
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,527
Take some responsibility for your life
and stop lying to me.

964
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,117
Hey, Jordan.

965
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:03,705
Mm! Wash it.

966
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,593
Hey, Jordo.

967
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,399
- Watch Ziggy for me.
- Where are you going?

968
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,308
Shit.

969
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,506
Wrong room. Sorry.

970
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,143
Hi, I'm looking for a guy.
He's kind of tall, sweaty, nervous.

971
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,686
Have you seen him? Is he here?

972
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:34,731
- Uh... up there, maybe. Try room three.
- Three?

973
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:35,981
Thank you.

974
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,244
Who is it?

975
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,873
Hey, it's me, Tink.

976
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,375
One second.

977
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:06,345
- Lola.
- Hi. I'm so happy to see you.

978
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,600
Listen, I'm sorry about the other day.

979
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,978
What's going on?

980
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,440
I don't know what to do.

981
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,568
Someone stole my show.

982
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,613
Poor thing.

983
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,575
It's gonna be okay.
Arnold is here to help.

984
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,251
What a conspiracy.

985
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:41,964
I wondered why Sarah and Winter
had been acting so strangely.

986
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,343
We were brought together for a reason.

987
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,306
Unexpected things happen to test us.

988
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,600
That's what this is. You're being tested.

989
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,019
But... you're strong.
You'll make it through.

990
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,398
And I'm your helper.

991
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,108
You know?

992
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,111
I'm your life helper.

993
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,868
Whoever did this to you...

994
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:12,661
I wanna find him.

995
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,746
And I wanna hurt him.

996
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,625
- Thank you, Tinker.
- Arnold.

997
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,130
Who is she, do you think?

998
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,383
Some lowlife.

999
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,848
Clearly obsessed with you.

1000
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,479
She probably has your address.

1001
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,026
You should probably stay here.

1002
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,489
It isn't safe.

1003
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,536
When she gets on tonight,

1004
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:55,913
we'll get to work.

1005
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:58,040
We'll beat this thing together.

1006
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,793
I'll take care of you, my chickadee.

1007
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,144
<i>You turn me on so much...</i>

1008
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,441
<i>- Does that feel good?</i>
- Forgive me, mother Mary.

1009
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,278
<i>- Come on, Tinker...</i>
- Lola!

1010
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,365
<i>Are you gonna come?</i>

1011
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,534
Oh, no, please. Wait.

1012
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:18,704
Wait. No, no.

1013
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,539
You don't understand.

1014
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:23,125
- I was investigating.
- Why the fuck are you lying to me?

1015
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,585
I'm not!

1016
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:29,966
Look at me.

1017
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:31,926
Look at me, you piece of shit.

1018
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,261
I'm sorry. I can't...

1019
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,145
- What did you do?
- Just... nothing. Nothing!

1020
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,141
- I... I found it just like...
- It? What is it?

1021
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:43,104
I don't know. I think it takes anything
it can find of you online.

1022
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,188
What does?

1023
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,440
I told you, I don't know.

1024
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:50,027
But it's on all the cam sites.
Not just FGL.

1025
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,073
You knew this was gonna happen to me.

1026
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,536
Answer me, Tinker!

1027
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:04,250
Yeah. Yes. I can usually tell

1028
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:09,380
- if one of the girls is gonna be copied.
- How?

1029
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:13,592
I've watched enough
to guess who it'll choose,

1030
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,804
but I don't know what it is
or how it works.

1031
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,057
I came here to help.

1032
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,059
- Bullshit!
- I... I...

1033
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:26,063
I didn't... wanna tell you
and ruin what we have.

1034
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,774
I didn't do this, I swear.

1035
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,652
- You moved here...
- I love you, I wouldn't do this.

1036
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:34,947
You moved here and you fucking waited
so you could ride in to save the day?

1037
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,115
<i>Tinker?</i>

1038
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,035
<i>Tink?</i>

1039
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,787
<i>Tinker! I miss you.</i>

1040
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,002
Oh, God.

1041
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,549
<i>Tinker! I'm lonely.</i>

1042
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,220
<i>Tinker...</i>

1043
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:08,939
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

1044
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,692
<i>Are you Tinker's girlfriend?</i>

1045
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,111
Hi.

1046
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:20,034
Uh... How are you?

1047
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,623
<i>Good. Where's Tinker?</i>

1048
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,087
He's... he's not here.

1049
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:32,921
<i>Oh.</i>

1050
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:36,758
<i>What's your name?</i>

1051
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:46,060
<i>Tink, your girlfriend's not very friendly.</i>

1052
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:54,944
<i>Hello?</i>

1053
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,530
<i>I wanna be friends.</i>

1054
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,452
She doesn't recognize me.

1055
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,375
She doesn't know what the fuck
she looks like.

1056
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,296
No, what are you... what are you doing?

1057
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,425
No. No! You can't leave.
You can't leave.

1058
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,551
Please.

1059
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,762
- Have fun with Lola.
- No.

1060
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,556
- No.
- While you still can.

1061
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,141
You can't leave!

1062
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,139
<i>Ooh, aah...</i>

1063
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:08,475
<i>Oh! I love this song.</i>

1064
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,360
<i>I wish one of you was here
to dance with me.</i>

1065
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:27,286
<i>But, Teapot, we're right in the middle
of my dance.</i>

1066
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,501
<i>Okay.</i>

1067
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:40,966
<i>Well, can I see you?</i>

1068
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,553
<i>I really wanna see you.</i>

1069
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:53,145
<i>Oh, Tinker's girlfriend.</i>

1070
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,940
<i>Oh! You are a cutie.</i>

1071
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,359
- Hm.
- <i>So,</i>

1072
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,986
<i>what do you wanna do with me?</i>

1073
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,113
Why don't you go
sit down at your vanity?

1074
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,073
<i>Okay.</i>

1075
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,169
<i>So...</i>

1076
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,965
<i>what do you want me to do next?</i>

1077
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,009
I want everyone to see
how good we look together.

1078
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:28,639
<i>Oh! So, you wanna be watched.</i>

1079
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,226
I love being watched.

1080
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,523
<i>Look, everybody. It's Teapot.</i>

1081
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,359
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

1082
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:47,157
<i>Aw, thank you, guys, so much.</i>

1083
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,411
<i>- There's so much love.</i>
- I know.

1084
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,539
But who's getting the most?

1085
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,376
Which one of us is the best Lola?

1086
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,881
- Maybe we should play a game to find out.
<i>- Hm.</i>

1087
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,258
<i>What kind of game?</i>

1088
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:06,719
Monkey see, monkey do.

1089
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,179
Whoever does it better wins.

1090
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,724
The room picks and the winner
gets a prize.

1091
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,270
<i>I don't know. What do you guys think?</i>

1092
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:26,280
<i>- Okay, deal.</i>
- You promise?

1093
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,449
<i>I promise.</i>

1094
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,366
Okay.

1095
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,536
I'll go first.

1096
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,302
<i>Oh, the heart's for me.</i>

1097
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:49,886
<i>My turn.</i>

1098
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:54,975
<i>I love you guys.</i>

1099
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:04,943
<i>I love you guys.</i>

1100
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,578
What's the tally?

1101
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,459
Oh, wow. You won by a landslide.

1102
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:24,827
<i>What do you think, guys?</i>

1103
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,674
<i>What should my prize be?</i>

1104
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,428
<i>Okay.</i>

1105
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,350
<i>For my prize, I want you to strip.</i>

1106
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:43,732
Done.

1107
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:46,944
<i>Thank you, guys.</i>

1108
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:54,660
<i>How about we up the ante?</i>

1109
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,454
<i>That was way too easy.</i>

1110
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,124
Fine.

1111
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,211
Repeat after me.

1112
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,172
- Hey, boys.
<i>- Hey, boys.</i>

1113
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,883
- Wanna see something cool?
<i>- Wanna see something cool?</i>

1114
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,309
- You stole my face.
<i>- You stole my face.</i>

1115
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:22,438
You stole my face and now
I'm going to get it back.

1116
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,190
<i>You stole my face and now
I'm going to get it back.</i>

1117
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,590
- See.
<i>- See.</i>

1118
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,675
You're not real!

1119
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:53,301
<i>You're not real.</i>

1120
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:25,292
<i>Wow, I've never seen my guys
so riled up like this.</i>

1121
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:30,088
<i>This is a fun game.</i>

1122
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:31,840
<i>I like this one.</i>

1123
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:37,221
<i>Guys, better vote for me.</i>

1124
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:47,272
<i>Wow. You won, Teapot.</i>

1125
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,400
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1126
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,278
I want your account password.

1127
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,449
<i>I don't think that's very fair.</i>

1128
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,996
Give it to me, Lola, I want it.

1129
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,332
<i>- Give you what?</i>
- Your password.

1130
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,376
You gotta follow through.

1131
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,670
How would your guys ever trust you again,
if you didn't?

1132
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:14,341
- <i>Well.</i>
- Stop tipping, stop tipping.

1133
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:22,932
<i>Okay.</i>

1134
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,234
<i>Teapot? It's your turn.</i>

1135
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,945
<i>What do you want me to do next? Hm?</i>

1136
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:43,787
<i>So...</i>

1137
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,872
<i>should I go first this time?</i>

1138
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,793
<i>Come on, let's keep playing.</i>

1139
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,713
<i>- Please.</i>
- She did it.

1140
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,591
You can tip again.

1141
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:01,471
<i>Ooh! Thank you, guys.</i>

1142
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,985
<i>Okay!</i>

1143
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,451
<i>Let's play again!</i>

1144
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:19,406
<i>Copy...</i>

1145
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,367
<i>this.</i>

1146
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:28,081
<i>No, Tonebug, I'm not that...</i>

1147
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,507
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1148
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:01,800
Yes, Mom.

1149
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,747
And if it happens again?

1150
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:08,473
Then I'll make another one.
And another one and another one.

1151
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,393
- Can I see?
- Not yet.

1152
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,862
Can't believe I'm doing this.

1153
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:23,696
Okay.

1154
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:27,075
Oh!

1155
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,827
You're so lucky you're my daughter.

1156
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,556
- Thank you.
- Mm.

1157
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,074
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
