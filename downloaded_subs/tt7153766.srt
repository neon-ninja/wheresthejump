00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:17,766
<i>I love it when you wear blue.</i>

3
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:20,869
<i>I mean,
I love you in anything.</i>

4
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:24,772
<i>But you wore blue
that first time I saw you,</i>

5
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:26,941
<i>so anytime
I see you in blue,</i>

6
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:29,413
<i>it reminds me of how I felt
at that moment.</i>

7
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:35,150
<i>How I never really knew what
being alive was until I saw you.</i>

8
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,418
<i>You unlocked something
inside me that day,</i>

9
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,390
<i>something I didn't
even realize was there.</i>

10
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:44,091
<i>And right then,
I knew that nothing in my life</i>

11
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:46,161
<i>was ever going to be the same.</i>

12
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:50,132
<i>In that moment,
I was transformed permanently.</i>

13
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,669
<i>You did that.</i>

14
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,743
My job is to access and interpret
data to produce analytical results.

15
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:10,648
I did that job.

16
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:17,120
Taking your frustration out on
me will not alter the results.

17
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:22,656
You're quite within your rights to
take your business to another bank.

18
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:25,226
Another analyst may interpret
the data more to your liking.

19
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,664
But they'd be doing a bad job.
Good morning.

20
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:31,966
What?

21
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,503
Nothing.

22
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,237
Jill, what?

23
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,874
Nothing.

24
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:42,045
I... just hope he likes vinegar
more than he likes honey.

25
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,613
She.

26
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,781
Oh.

27
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:49,085
Well, then...

28
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,088
- Hey.
- Hi.

29
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,227
Have a seat.

30
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:32,696
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

31
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:36,567
So...

32
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:38,970
that report...

33
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:43,674
That report
is faultless.

34
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:48,809
You are every bit as good
as I hoped you'd be.

35
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:50,278
I appreciate that.

36
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,280
You're going to do
really well here.

37
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,986
- I'm certainly gonna try.
- Good.

38
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,222
Good, good, good.

39
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:05,061
So, the ABA conference
is the last week of September.

40
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:11,165
Two nights at the Hyatt
Regency in New Orleans.

41
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:15,038
And... we should go.

42
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:20,044
You should... go.

43
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:26,181
I think I'd need
a little more experience.

44
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:29,186
Well, I could
help you with that.

45
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,091
- I should get back to work.
- Good.

46
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,764
Good, good, good, good,
good, good, good.

47
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,742
<i>Of my new friends, I'd say, um,
Jill's probably the closest.</i>

48
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,047
We go out after work
almost every night.

49
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,282
- <i>How's your boss?</i>
- He's great. I mean...

50
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:04,686
He has really high standards
and he's really demanding,

51
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,722
but when he says you got something
right, you know you got it right,

52
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:11,092
which is really rewarding, especially
since it's so competitive here.

53
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:15,095
<i>I suppose that explains why you're
eating your lunch in such a rush.</i>

54
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:17,831
Hey, at least it's green.

55
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,068
But I kind of do
have to get going.

56
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,071
I just wanted to let you know everything's
great. I couldn't be happier.

57
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:26,307
<i>Yeah. Now that you're
450 miles away from me</i>

58
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:28,076
<i>and everyone else
you've ever known.</i>

59
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,444
Mmm. Don't do that.

60
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:33,247
It was a fantastic opportunity.
I couldn't say no.

61
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:37,184
And besides, you know
what an impulsive girl I am.

62
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:39,054
Anyway, I gotta go.
Okay?

63
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:40,958
I love you. Bye!

64
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,121
Ooh. Look at that.

65
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,021
Can I talk to you?

66
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:14,392
Hey.

67
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:43,054
Yeah, that's me.

68
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:51,795
Down and... Mm-hmm.

69
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:56,797
Ah.

70
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,299
- Sawyer Valentini.
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,169
What a name.

72
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,437
Sawyer Valentini.

73
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,141
- It's a sexy-ass name.
- Thanks.

74
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,343
I'm named after my grandfather
on my mother's side.

75
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,345
He died of eye cancer.

76
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:13,217
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
I didn't...

77
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,951
Your little face.

78
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:20,554
- That was you being funny?
- Hey, if we can't laugh at cancer, who are we?

79
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,523
Oh. That's dark.

80
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,194
Hail Satan.

81
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,898
- Promise me one thing, Jesse.
- It's Mark.

82
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,169
Yeah. Tonight's going to go
how you want it to go.

83
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,538
It's not even a question.

84
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,942
But afterwards, you don't call
me, you don't contact me.

85
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:43,477
It's like we never met.

86
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,483
You good with that?

87
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:49,953
Yeah.
Jesse's so good with that.

88
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:56,024
So,

89
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,928
this is my apartment.

90
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:02,499
Yeah. And, um,

91
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,236
this is my, um, room.

92
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,155
- Fuck! Fuck!
- What the fuck?

93
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,056
Oh, my God.

94
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:31,992
I-I thought that's what you said
you wanted. You initiated it.

95
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:35,063
Oh, fuck.

96
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:37,001
No.

97
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,953
<i>Your life slips
away from you, you know?</i>

98
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:38,992
<i>Changing your phone number
and your e-mail becomes normal.</i>

99
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:43,633
<i>Changing your lunch hour
every day becomes normal.</i>

100
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,301
<i>Second-guessing
every single thing you say</i>

101
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:49,404
<i>in case it might
be misinterpreted?</i>

102
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:51,171
<i>Normal.</i>

103
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:53,407
Taking out a restraining order.
Normal.

104
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:56,312
Relocating to another city.
Normal.

105
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:00,484
But you still see
your stalker everywhere?

106
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:08,323
Well, rationally, I know
that this is my neuroses

107
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:11,628
colluding with my imagination
to manifest my worst fears.

108
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:15,132
I know that.

109
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,902
But I'm not rational.

110
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:25,573
I'm alone in a strange city,

111
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:30,381
and, uh, I never feel safe.

112
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,417
Not for one minute.

113
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,386
So what do I do?

114
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,689
Where do I go?

115
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:45,561
Or maybe I just surrender
and accept that this is my life.

116
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:49,097
That doesn't sound
like much of a life.

117
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:52,099
No. Not one that I want
to keep on living.

118
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:55,271
Do you often have thoughts
like that, Sawyer?

119
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:59,406
Thoughts like, um...?

120
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:02,209
Not wanting to keep living.

121
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:04,746
- Like suicide?
- Yes.

122
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:08,051
Do you ever think
about taking your own life?

123
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,423
I have, in the past.

124
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:17,695
And did you ever give a thought
as to how you'd do it?

125
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,502
Do you know
the therapeutic index?

126
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,503
It's, um...

127
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:32,806
It's the ratio that measures
the blood concentration

128
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:36,412
of if a drug is toxic
or when it's effective.

129
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:41,115
The larger the therapeutic
index, the safer the drug.

130
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:43,454
The smaller, the more dangerous.

131
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:49,526
That's how I'd see myself
spending my final hours.

132
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,464
Testing drugs.

133
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:58,198
That's pretty specific.

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,234
Yeah, well, my dad always said why would
you trust someone to do a big job

135
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:02,837
if they can't do a small one?

136
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:07,407
There's some more forms
you need to fill out.

137
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,611
- Just routine.
- That's it? I'm cured?

138
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:13,146
Well, we can discuss
treatment options

139
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,149
when you finish
the paperwork.

140
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,751
Well, I'd really like to book
another appointment with you.

141
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:20,487
You're a really good listener.

142
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:23,659
I'm obviously the first person
to tell you that.

143
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:28,529
<i>Do I need to read
every comma and semicolon?</i>

144
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:31,332
<i>It's up to you.
Like I said, it's a boilerplate.</i>

145
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:34,669
<i>Privacy disclosures,
liability, that kind of thing.</i>

146
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,737
I finished my homework.

147
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:39,272
If the counselor has a half hour
for me sometime next week...

148
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,808
Please have a seat,
Ms. Valentini.

149
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,511
Someone will be with you
shortly to discuss next steps.

150
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:46,546
No, we just discussed
the next step, so...

151
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:48,384
It should just
take a minute.

152
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,388
Okay.

153
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,711
- Sawyer Valentini?
- Yeah.

154
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,679
I'm Dennis.
Please follow me.

155
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,714
Wh... Look, I don't have
a lot of time.

156
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:22,552
I should be back
at work, so...

157
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:54,817
- What am I doing here?
- I need to look through your bag.

158
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:57,218
Why?

159
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,886
Don't worry. You're not
being singled out.

160
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,325
I look through everyone's bag.
It's procedure.

161
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,819
Uh, excuse me.
That's my stuff.

162
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,288
Good afternoon.
I'm Nurse Boles.

163
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,491
Can you strip down
to your underwear for me?

164
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:40,461
Please. Take off your clothes
down to your underwear.

165
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:42,697
And remove
all your jewelry.

166
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,799
Do you understand?

167
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,336
If you need help
removing your clothes...

168
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,938
- What?
- To check for identifying marks.

169
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,341
Scars,
birthmarks, moles.

170
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,675
It's to protect you, the other
patients, and the hospital.

171
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:57,812
Look, I'm not sure what's
happening here. I, uh...

172
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:01,716
The nursing assessment includes
a head-to-toe skin examination.

173
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,516
It's a hospital-wide
policy.

174
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:05,519
There's nothing invasive
about it.

175
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:08,425
Look, I have to go. I'm gonna
be late for work, so...

176
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:15,328
- The door's locked.
- For your privacy.

177
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,798
I need you to take off your
clothes down to your underwear

178
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,236
and remove
all your jewelry.

179
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:24,975
There's nothing wrong with me.

180
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:30,544
I just needed to talk to someone,
and the counselor said that I...

181
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,579
Did she tell you to do this?

182
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,948
Miss Valentini, are you
refusing to cooperate?

183
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,718
What happens if I do?

184
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,420
It would be better for everyone,
but especially yourself,

185
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:41,857
if you'd just do as I ask.

186
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,430
Turn around.

187
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,768
Lift your arms.

188
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:00,977
That's all.
Put this on.

189
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:05,413
Can I go now? I've done
everything that you asked.

190
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,682
You're upset.

191
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,817
Take these.

192
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,356
- Then I get to go?
- You'll feel better.

193
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,635
Follow me.

194
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,886
There's been
some kind of mistake.

195
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:49,456
Your name
is Sawyer Valentini.

196
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,392
You know that already.

197
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:56,030
By signing this, you've consented to
voluntary commitment for 24 hours.

198
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:59,700
No. The counselor said
the forms were routine.

199
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:01,638
You signed it.

200
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,639
Look...

201
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,040
you're just
doing your job.

202
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:11,645
And you've been so considerate of
my feelings and my well-being.

203
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,414
And you're right.

204
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,750
I signed those papers.

205
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:18,522
I'm here by my own volition.
It's for my own good.

206
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,625
Can I ask, do you think
I could just make a phone call,

207
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:26,827
just to let my family know
that I'm okay,

208
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,628
let them know
where I am?

209
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,731
You get a phone call.
That's allowed.

210
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,032
You're so nice.

211
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,101
You're saying you want
your phone call now?

212
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:37,003
Yes. Yes, that is
what I'm saying.

213
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:38,774
Oh, my God. It's like
you read my mind.

214
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:50,951
Yes, hi.
My name is Sawyer Valentini.

215
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:53,854
I am at Highland Creek
Behavioral Health Facility.

216
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:56,490
I am being held here
against my will.

217
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:59,426
Please send help.
Thank you.

218
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,996
I'll be out of here
in, like, 20 minutes.

219
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:06,102
Do you know how many calls the
cops get like that every week?

220
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:09,770
Those are from crazy people.

221
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:11,605
Let's go back
to the ward.

222
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,744
No, I'm not going anywhere
until the cops show up.

223
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:18,745
Can...
Can you stop taking notes?

224
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,816
I have rights.

225
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:24,721
Don't make me ask again.

226
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,470
Hi. Alison.

227
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:43,105
How's your baby?

228
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,176
How's your baby?

229
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,912
Alison. The baby.

230
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:52,581
Hey!

231
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:05,960
Fuck!

232
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:10,830
Oh, what?

233
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:13,800
You think you're too good
to talk to me now, Alison?

234
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:16,973
Oh, my name's not Alison, but, yeah,
yeah, I am too good to talk to you.

235
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:21,841
Hey, bitch!

236
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:26,012
Listen, when you fall asleep,
I'm gonna cut your hair off.

237
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,815
All of your hair.

238
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,215
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,519
With what?

240
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,157
They let you anywhere near sharp objects?
I doubt that very much.

241
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:43,263
Oh, God. You're scaring me to
death, you fucking mental patient.

242
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,033
I'll be thinking about you
when I'm back in my own bed

243
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:50,104
in my own house, getting ready
to go to my own job.

244
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,673
Calling her a mental patient
isn't helpful.

245
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,575
We need to support each other.

246
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:57,544
Yeah, well, support me by not
talking to me or looking at me.

247
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,946
I shouldn't even be in here.

248
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:02,081
Yeah, so, uh...

249
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,217
So you got put in here
by mistake, I'm guessing.

250
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,886
Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

251
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:08,289
And the cops are on their way
right now to get me out.

252
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,992
The cops are on their way
to take you out of here?

253
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:13,961
Really?

254
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,596
- They said that?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:18,598
In those words,
specifically, to you?

256
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,569
Liar, liar.

257
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,337
Liar, liar.

258
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:26,040
Oh.

259
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:28,174
- Oh, man.
- <i>Evening, Dolores.</i>

260
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:31,177
Hi, Steve. How you doing...
Steve's partner?

261
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,014
Another
night, another 10-75.

262
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:37,251
Yeah, second floor
called down.

263
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,653
I've got her
admission form here.

264
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,955
You got any coffee, Dolores?

265
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,192
It's in the break room,
Steve. Help yourself.

266
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:46,763
Steve's partner
can't have any.

267
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:51,699
What's your favorite coffee,
Dolores?

268
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,232
Mmm. Expresso.

269
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,135
- Expresso?
- Expresso.

270
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:57,203
- Ex-presso.
- Ex-presso.

271
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:59,839
Why don't you get one of those
new Nespresso machines?

272
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:02,041
I like that.

273
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:05,011
I like black coffee, little bit of cream.
You like cream?

274
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:08,848
- No. I like just sugar. Lots of sugar.
- Hmm.

275
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,283
- Lots of sugar?
- Uh-huh.

276
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,219
I gotta do Splenda.

277
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:17,156
I love coffee. You know what?
Your coffee? Sucks.

278
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:20,894
- But you're still mad I won't let you have any.
- I could get some if I wanted to.

279
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,996
We both know that.

280
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:26,068
Have a good night, Steve.
Not Steve's partner.

281
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:31,105
Wake up.

282
00:22:31,107 --> 00:22:33,272
Wake up!

283
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:35,209
Wake up.

284
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:37,377
Wake up!

285
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,713
...like you.
It was like a paid intern.

286
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:42,148
Let her do all the stuff around
your house, kick around some shit.

287
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,850
- Yeah, why not?
- Really?

288
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:46,185
- I've done that. I've adopted them.
- Really?

289
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:48,321
I'm like Drake.

290
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,023
- Yeah.
- What does Drake do?

291
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,424
He adopts strippers.

292
00:22:51,426 --> 00:22:53,196
He adopts them?

293
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,699
Puts them in little homes,
in their own communities.

294
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:05,838
Must feel good to be back in
your own bed, in your own house,

295
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,174
getting ready to go back
to your own job.

296
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:27,293
Hi.

297
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:28,831
I'm Jacob.

298
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:31,900
Move.

299
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:35,638
Oh!

300
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:39,109
Let me out!

301
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,311
There's been
some kind of mistake.

302
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:47,313
Look...

303
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,916
I'm not supposed
to be in here.

304
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:53,453
I'm locked up in here with fucking psycho rapists!

305
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:55,388
Fuck.

306
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,661
The cops are on their way, and I
need to get out of here right now!

307
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,831
Fucking bitch!

308
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,433
No. I...

309
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:08,868
- Dennis!
- Yes?

310
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,439
What the fuck was that?

311
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,311
We don't hit them back. She does
that again, she goes downstairs.

312
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:21,181
No, I don't want...
Aaah!

313
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:10,196
Alison pissed the bed,
y'all.

314
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,944
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

315
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:42,998
Hi, Sawyer. Just coffee?
Nothing to eat?

316
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,401
Good summation.

317
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,838
How was your night?
Are you settling in okay?

318
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,508
I'm not settling in anywhere.
I'm going home today.

319
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,946
Dr. Hawthorne asked me to bring you
to have a talk with him about that.

320
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:00,614
Finally.

321
00:26:00,616 --> 00:26:02,519
A real doctor.

322
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:16,265
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

323
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:19,599
All good points.

324
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,537
Really, good points.
Absolutely.

325
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:25,271
Tell Diane
we're on the same page

326
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:28,375
and that
it won't happen again.

327
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:32,145
Really.
This is a good thing.

328
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:34,184
To be continued.
Okay.

329
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,049
Bye.

330
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:38,321
Sorry.

331
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:41,954
Dr. Hawthorne.

332
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:44,326
Uh, you can see
I don't belong here.

333
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:48,060
You know there's been
some kind of mistake.

334
00:26:48,062 --> 00:26:51,397
I can't spend
another day here.

335
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,232
I can't spend another minute.

336
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:56,569
I have a job.
I have a life.

337
00:26:56,571 --> 00:27:01,140
Yes. Uh, well, we want you to
get back to enjoying that life.

338
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:03,342
Really.
That's our goal.

339
00:27:03,344 --> 00:27:06,615
Good. So what can I do to give you
one less patient to worry about?

340
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:11,084
Well, it says here that
you've been assessed

341
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:13,386
as a danger to yourself
and to others.

342
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:16,192
So that means
more observation.

343
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:19,561
Doctor, look at me.

344
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:23,398
Look at me.

345
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:31,570
Doctor, I have a wonderful
support system around me.

346
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:34,574
I have family,
I have friends, coworkers.

347
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:38,110
I have neighbors.

348
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:42,316
The best thing for me is to be
surrounded by the people I love.

349
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,283
Now, did I indicate
to the counselor

350
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:48,422
that I sometimes,
occasionally, feel down?

351
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,359
Sure, I did.
But everybody does.

352
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:54,394
I'm building a new life
for myself, Doctor.

353
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:56,596
I'm meeting new people.

354
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,134
I run.

355
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:01,503
I'm going to adopt
a rescue dog.

356
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,271
That's what's
gonna help me.

357
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:06,909
Not being stuck in here.

358
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:10,513
Give my bed to someone
who needs it.

359
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,649
Doctor.

360
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,519
Uh, yeah.
But you see, um,

361
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:24,092
it says here that you
assaulted a staff member.

362
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:28,462
He looked like
someone I knew.

363
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:31,330
Yes, but it says here
that you attacked him.

364
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:35,001
I... No.
I was under a lot of stress.

365
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,636
The police
were supposed to come.

366
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:40,607
And it says here that you
assaulted a male patient, Jacob.

367
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:42,145
No. He...

368
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:49,484
Look, I had a rough night.

369
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,185
But look at me now.

370
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:55,321
Right.

371
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:58,058
So, because of the
multiple acts of violence,

372
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,059
we're looking
at another seven days.

373
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:02,428
What? Seven days?

374
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,397
I need to take this.

375
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,301
Uh... to be continued.

376
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:10,706
Yeah, hello, Diane.
How are you?

377
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:20,312
Okay, Hayley.
I'll take it from here.

378
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:24,117
First thing we do in these meetings is
go over the Highland Creek rules book.

379
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,186
Maximum use of a public
phone is ten minutes.

380
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:30,389
No smuggling food or drink
into the ward.

381
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:33,659
Uh, no touching
the other patients.

382
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:36,463
Masturbating in
their hair is fine.

383
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:38,467
That word?
That got you. Okay.

384
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:43,638
We use these meetings
to go over our daily goals.

385
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:49,443
Mmm. My goal today is to be
friendly and helpful to everyone.

386
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,712
What do you say?
What do you say?

387
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:54,250
Hmm.

388
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:59,485
Okay. Excuse me, y'all,
for one second.

389
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:03,290
Maybe I need to make
my consultations one-on-one.

390
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,762
What about you?
What are your daily goals?

391
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:10,496
Finding someone to believe
I don't belong in here.

392
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,165
Oh.

393
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,101
You're no different
from anybody else in here.

394
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:17,570
- You gave them an in.
- What are you talking about?

395
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:20,607
Not now. Later. Okay?

396
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,145
Okay.

397
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:26,879
<i>They brought up suicide.
You bit.</i>

398
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:29,281
That's all they need.

399
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:31,387
They've got beds.
You've got insurance.

400
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,521
But I'm fine. I just needed
to talk to somebody.

401
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:38,290
Yeah, that's why Highland Creek
and all the other Highland Creeks

402
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:40,393
and Tumbling Pines
and Cedar Valleys

403
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:43,833
under the ADS Health
Enterprises umbrella exist.

404
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:48,805
You talk, they find a way to
keep you and get you admitted.

405
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:52,204
And you stay locked up

406
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:55,274
until Aetna,
Blue Cross, Medicaid

407
00:30:55,276 --> 00:30:57,446
or whoever insures you
will pay.

408
00:30:59,514 --> 00:31:02,581
Soon as the money runs out,
you're cured.

409
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,251
- But that's...
- Business.

410
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:06,919
Business.

411
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,923
Highland Creek is just like any
other business in America.

412
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:12,325
They got a number
to hit every month.

413
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:15,628
They need to admit as many patients
to fill those beds to get that money.

414
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,298
You know,
the law of averages

415
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,801
suggests that a percentage of the
patients admitted to Highland Creek

416
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:25,271
are in actual need
of psychiatric care.

417
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:27,941
It also suggests
that a higher percentage...

418
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:30,609
Are just like me.

419
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:33,746
- They're locking up sane people for profit.
- Yeah.

420
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:36,715
I'm here for seven days because
my insurance company approved it.

421
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:38,451
Boom.

422
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:41,354
It's not that bad.

423
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:46,259
I mean, it's inhuman, but compared
to where you could have landed?

424
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:48,828
Tumbling Pines streams
meth addict cage matches.

425
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,197
This place has got Hayley,

426
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:54,201
plus some less qualified
and motivated employees.

427
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,636
There's really
no comparison.

428
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,339
And if you hook up
with the right people,

429
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:03,909
you don't gotta worry
about weed, booze, porn,

430
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:07,914
or whatever you use to make life
seem less of a crushing void.

431
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:11,217
I, myself, am in the throes
of kicking an opioid addiction,

432
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:14,386
so keep that shit
away from me.

433
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:17,357
Final words:
Do your time.

434
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,225
Keep your head down.

435
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,595
God, you're talking to me
like we're in prison.

436
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:23,530
You're welcome.

437
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,432
Don't cause any scenes.

438
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:27,867
Don't make any enemies.

439
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:32,271
Find a community, learn how
to live with the routine.

440
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:34,707
It'll be over
before you know it.

441
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,778
You've got any questions,
come find me.

442
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:50,792
Mm-hmm.

443
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:04,706
Ah.

444
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:27,396
Oh.

445
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,001
No.

446
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:34,869
No way.

447
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:38,975
You can't be
anywhere near me.

448
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:44,877
This won't work.

449
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:48,647
The Boston cops have got a
record of the restraining order.

450
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:50,517
I hope following me all
the way here was worth it

451
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,984
because you're going
to jail.

452
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,855
- Move, Alison.
- No...

453
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:59,895
George Shaw? Is that what
you're calling yourself?

454
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:04,830
This man
is called David Strine.

455
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:08,367
And he's been following me
and calling me and texting me

456
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,804
and showing up at my job and
breaking into my fucking house.

457
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,739
Take
your meds and move on.

458
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:17,344
No. I'm not going anywhere until
the cops haul his ass into jail.

459
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,713
George, did you do or say
anything to provoke the patient?

460
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:22,849
Stop calling him that.
His name is David.

461
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,354
He's followed me all the
way here from Boston.

462
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:29,389
I've never
even been to Boston,

463
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:30,989
though I am a Sox fan.

464
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,425
You're a fucking liar!
I want my phone.

465
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:35,362
I've saved all the text
messages you sent me,

466
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,762
all the really,
really sick ones.

467
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,665
Do you remember, David?

468
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,900
All the ones where you said you'd kill
yourself if you couldn't have me.

469
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:44,837
- You're crazy.
- Maybe I should go back to the other ward.

470
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,373
I'm not doing
any good here.

471
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,543
No one is fucking
buying this, Strine.

472
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:52,945
- It's George.
- No, I get it.

473
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:56,750
It's not hard to get a job here. You don't need
qualifications. You don't need fucking training.

474
00:34:56,752 --> 00:35:00,887
I want my fucking phone call! I'm calling
the cops, and I want him arrested.

475
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:03,389
Your phone privileges
have been suspended.

476
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:05,458
No! I don't want to...

477
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,527
I don't want to be
in here with you!

478
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:10,864
I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you!

479
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:13,400
No, I'm telling you the
truth, I swear to God.

480
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,467
Get your hands off me!

481
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:18,036
He's lying.
Fucking lying!

482
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:21,040
Oh, Jesus.
You're hurting my arm!

483
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,976
Fuck off! No.

484
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:24,911
Get on that side.

485
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:27,045
Fuck you.

486
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:42,061
It's like you didn't listen
to a word I said.

487
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:45,465
You keep this up, and you'll be spending the
rest of your time down in the basement.

488
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:48,371
You said you wanted to help
me, so help me out of this.

489
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,072
Good night.

490
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:04,453
Uh...

491
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:11,190
Yeah. Yeah, this story's gonna
be like the biggest story ever.

492
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:14,494
Yeah, I've got evidence.
I got everything I need.

493
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:17,230
Finally just going
to shut it down.

494
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:20,402
Yeah, man. Yeah.

495
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:26,876
Let me call you back.

496
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:45,757
I don't know. She's,
like, a little tricky.

497
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:48,161
Sometimes she responds to me,
sometimes she doesn't.

498
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:49,498
- Yeah.
- You know.

499
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,270
Hi.

500
00:36:57,272 --> 00:36:59,538
- What?
- Give it back, thief.

501
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,940
You took my last pack of cigarettes.
Where'd you put 'em?

502
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:06,512
- Hide 'em in your snatch?
- I was in fucking restraints, you idiot!

503
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:08,681
Oh! Fuck me!

504
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:10,786
Oh, well done,
Violet.

505
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:15,121
<i>Sawyer,
based on what it says here,</i>

506
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:17,623
<i>you are one incident away
from being sent to the basement.</i>

507
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,592
Look, I was sexually assaulted.
Where's the outrage?

508
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:23,695
Where's my advocate?
Who do I report this to?

509
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:26,067
And what's in the basement?

510
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:30,837
- What's in the basement?
- Solitary confinement.

511
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,672
Oh, my God. Send me there
right fucking now.

512
00:37:33,674 --> 00:37:35,608
My stalker... You've read
the counselor's notes.

513
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,911
You know who I'm talking about.
He's here.

514
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:39,978
He's got himself a job
in the fucking hospital.

515
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,980
I talked to the second floor
about George.

516
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:44,884
No, he's not called George.

517
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:46,719
We did a thorough
background check.

518
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:48,855
Yeah, you did a thorough
background check on George.

519
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:51,324
I'm telling you, he isn't called George.
His name is David Strine.

520
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:54,259
I'm trying to tell... You're not even listening
to me. I'm trying to tell you the man...

521
00:37:54,261 --> 00:37:57,699
And I'm adding a course of risperidone
and lithium to your meds.

522
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,933
What's that for?

523
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:03,235
To keep you
from hurting anyone else.

524
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:05,137
And yourself.

525
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,042
Are you serious?

526
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:10,076
That's your diagnosis?

527
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:12,210
You're sedating me
when I've just told you

528
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:16,815
there's a predator who's followed
me here from another city.

529
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:20,522
You should be protecting me.
What medication are you on?

530
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:23,755
That's funny.

531
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:26,594
Yes.
Well... to be continued.

532
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:47,917
Hi. I'm Jacob.

533
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:56,759
Sawyer.

534
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:02,628
Listen, I... I just want
to apologize, again,

535
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,734
if I said or did anything
to upset you.

536
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:11,170
I see the doctor's put a little
something extra in there.

537
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:13,108
I really hope it helps.

538
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:20,212
I hope someone cuts your balls off
and stuffs them down your throat.

539
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:22,415
What? Are you
fucking touching me?

540
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:31,690
You motherfucker!
It's him!

541
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,393
It's him! I'm telling
you, it's Strine!

542
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:35,661
- No, no, no, listen!
- Calm down.

543
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:39,197
He's been to my mom's house. He's been to
my fucking mom's house and stolen our mail!

544
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,101
I'm not fucking crazy! No!

545
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:44,306
Fuck you! No.

546
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:48,377
Ow!

547
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,788
Let me use it.

548
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,393
I... Excuse me?

549
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,663
Your cell phone.

550
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,100
I saw you.
I know you have one.

551
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,768
That's a major infraction
of the rules.

552
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,237
But guess what? I don't care,
as long as I get to use it.

553
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,206
Otherwise, I tell everyone.

554
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:56,074
Yeah. Your credibility
is sky high around here.

555
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:58,413
You really want
to take that chance?

556
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:06,119
You call the cops again,

557
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:09,489
they'll do nothing... again
but take my cell phone.

558
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:12,358
I'm not calling the cops.
I promise.

559
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,960
Hmm.

560
00:41:13,962 --> 00:41:15,431
And I'll suck your dick.

561
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,308
Five minutes.
Don't get caught.

562
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:38,150
- Hello.
- <i>Oh, Mom, it's me.</i>

563
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:42,454
Sawyer, where've you been? It's been,
like, three days since you've called.

564
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:45,324
- Yeah, Mom...
- <i>I expected to see your face on a milk carton.</i>

565
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:46,994
Mom, I'm in a bit of trouble.

566
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:52,331
- How much do you need?
- No, no, no. It's not that, Mom.

567
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,168
I haven't got a lot of time.
I need you to listen.

568
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:58,404
Just don't panic.

569
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:01,808
But I've been involuntarily committed
to a facility called Highland Creek

570
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,110
here in Pennsylvania.

571
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:06,579
They said I was suicidal, but
I swear to God, Mom, I'm not.

572
00:42:06,581 --> 00:42:08,980
It's just an insurance scam.
But listen.

573
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:11,550
There's this guy I never told
you about when I was in Boston.

574
00:42:11,552 --> 00:42:13,351
- There was this guy who...
- Shh.

575
00:42:13,353 --> 00:42:15,822
There was this guy...
He was kind of stalking me.

576
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:19,358
What do you mean,
kind of stalking you?

577
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,929
<i>Mom, he got himself a job. He got
himself a job at the facility.</i>

578
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,831
He's there,
in the hospital with you?

579
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,300
- Yeah.
- <i>Have you told the doctors?</i>

580
00:42:27,302 --> 00:42:31,070
- <i>Have they called the police?</i>
- Mom, no one fucking believes me.

581
00:42:31,072 --> 00:42:33,471
Sorry. I'm... I'm...

582
00:42:33,473 --> 00:42:36,074
I'm... They drug me
and they tie me to a bed.

583
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:38,411
And I'm here for seven days,
and no one's helping me.

584
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:41,380
Oh, my God! Sawyer!

585
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:44,250
<i>You know I'd never bother you with
this if I could find a way out,</i>

586
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:46,853
<i>but I need help.</i>

587
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,887
What's the name
of that hospital?

588
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:51,424
Uh, Highland Creek.
It's, um...

589
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:54,092
It's off Highway 90. I don't know the
exact address. Mom, I've gotta go.

590
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:55,330
I love you.

591
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:03,572
Rain check
on the blow job?

592
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:10,445
I wish I could go one
day without hearing that.

593
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:19,053
I want to see my daughter!
Get her out here now!

594
00:43:20,455 --> 00:43:22,889
I'm not leaving, and I'm
only going to get louder,

595
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,523
so you probably
should do something!

596
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:29,061
She didn't know
what she was signing.

597
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:32,197
I want her released immediately.
She's coming home with me.

598
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,134
Mrs. Valentini,
I understand your concern,

599
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:38,036
but right now this is
the best place for Sawyer.

600
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:41,944
Stuck in a hospital with her
stalker is the best place for her?

601
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:44,479
Repeat that.

602
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,915
I think you need to talk
to Administration.

603
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,652
Highland Creek is a very ethical
organization, Mrs. Valentini.

604
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:55,253
The decision regarding
Sawyer's admission

605
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:57,623
was made by an attending
psychiatrist

606
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:00,960
in consultation with members
of our clinical treatment team.

607
00:44:00,962 --> 00:44:02,661
Are you going
to release her?

608
00:44:02,663 --> 00:44:05,163
Sawyer is absolutely free
to leave

609
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:08,934
once we're convinced that she no longer
poses a clear threat to herself and others.

610
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,569
She doesn't.

611
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:12,471
You only made her
think she does

612
00:44:12,473 --> 00:44:15,474
so you could describe her as
suicidal on your insurance claim.

613
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:18,710
Let's focus

614
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:23,049
on the positive work
we do here at Highland Creek.

615
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:28,154
I have letters and e-mails
and phone messages,

616
00:44:28,156 --> 00:44:32,023
all attesting to the ways we've
turned patients' lives around.

617
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:34,025
I'd be happy
to share some with you.

618
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:36,962
- I'm calling a lawyer.
- You're quite within your rights.

619
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:39,165
As am I
to contact our team.

620
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,032
But...

621
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:44,436
is that really
in Sawyer's best interests?

622
00:44:44,438 --> 00:44:46,038
No, seriously.

623
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,277
I'm concerned that coming off
as frivolously litigious

624
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:54,079
might adversely affect Sawyer's
current employment situation.

625
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:57,116
She hasn't been
in that job for long.

626
00:44:57,118 --> 00:45:01,023
And it might make potential
future employers apprehensive.

627
00:45:03,223 --> 00:45:05,192
Are we willing to risk
your daughter's future?

628
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,661
Can I at least see her?

629
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:12,398
I mean, if I could just see for
myself that she's all right.

630
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,000
This place does have
visiting hours, doesn't it?

631
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:16,768
Could I at least
have one visit?

632
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,704
Of course.

633
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:21,306
You've arrived just
at the end of visiting hours,

634
00:45:21,308 --> 00:45:24,278
but I can give you
20 minutes.

635
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:42,464
So this is what it takes to get
you to call and ask for help.

636
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:47,266
I'm sorry, Mom.

637
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:50,369
- You don't have to apologize.
- Yes, I do.

638
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:53,072
I should have told you
about all this.

639
00:45:53,074 --> 00:45:56,208
Should have told you about
Strine, the real reason I moved.

640
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,110
Is he here now? 'Cause I'll
haul him out of here myself.

641
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:02,047
No. He works
the night shift.

642
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:04,318
No visitors at night.
Stalker logic.

643
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:08,253
I'm getting you out.

644
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:12,358
That idiot doctor and that bitch
of an administrator can't stop me.

645
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,692
I'll go to the police,
to the FBI.

646
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:17,395
I'll hire the most expensive
lawyer in the world.

647
00:46:17,397 --> 00:46:19,500
Whatever it takes, you're
coming home with me.

648
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:22,835
Now, how are you
otherwise?

649
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:25,170
You look tired.

650
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:27,840
I'd love to just be tired.

651
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:30,512
Mom, I'm scared.

652
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:33,779
What else
can I do for you?

653
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:37,215
What's with these clothes?
Unacceptable.

654
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,617
They're probably not
even laundered properly.

655
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:42,556
I'll bring you some of mine.
I always pack too much.

656
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,391
Hey. Listen to me.

657
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:48,527
I am getting you out.

658
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:50,496
You are coming back home.

659
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:54,369
And this man, this stalker
is done harassing you.

660
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:58,373
I just need one thing
from you, Sawyer.

661
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,141
This.

662
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,045
You and me talking.

663
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:08,346
Tell me the truth.

664
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:11,349
No more walls. You've been
building walls since...

665
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:12,686
Dad. Yeah.

666
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:18,556
Yeah, that was hard,
but, uh, this is different, Mom.

667
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:20,061
I promise.

668
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:23,728
You're a tough kid.
You always have been.

669
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,599
But... I'm your mother.

670
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:29,270
Let me help you.

671
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,438
So, how do I
reach you in here?

672
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,708
Well, my phone privileges
have been suspended,

673
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,476
but that guy's phone
I called you from... Nate?

674
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,913
Call him, and he'll find me.
Or I'll catch up with you.

675
00:47:40,915 --> 00:47:42,815
Where are you staying?

676
00:47:42,817 --> 00:47:46,451
I'm at the Lux Star Inn down
the road just two minutes.

677
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:49,188
I will mobilize
the troops

678
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,791
and I'll be back in a couple
of hours with fresh clothes

679
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:55,697
and an army
of cops and lawyers.

680
00:47:58,431 --> 00:48:00,465
Hang in there,
sweetheart.

681
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,303
Cavalry's coming.

682
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:05,770
I understand,
Mrs. Valentini.

683
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:09,343
But there's nothing we can do unless you
have proof that a crime's been committed.

684
00:48:10,944 --> 00:48:12,647
I'm sorry.

685
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:18,284
<i>Pennsylvania state law
mandates that a patient can only be held</i>

686
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:21,554
<i>on involuntary commitment for
seven days without a court order.</i>

687
00:48:21,556 --> 00:48:24,223
<i>And, look, they're not going to go to
the hassle of getting a court order</i>

688
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:26,491
<i>after her insurance
stops paying.</i>

689
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:28,860
<i>Is it inconvenient?
Sure.</i>

690
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:32,431
<i>Should something be done to
stop it happening? Absolutely.</i>

691
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:36,201
<i>As your lawyer, is it my priority
getting Sawyer back into your care?</i>

692
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:37,869
<i>It's number one.</i>

693
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:40,271
<i>Keep me in the loop
about the situation.</i>

694
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:43,675
<i>If you think there's legal cause to
intercede, I'll get right on it.</i>

695
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:48,750
Hello?
Did you just hang up on me?

696
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:51,717
Okay, everybody.

697
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:53,221
Turn around.

698
00:48:55,956 --> 00:48:59,224
- What are you doing here?
- Hello, Sawyer.

699
00:48:59,226 --> 00:49:01,594
Just picking up
an extra shift.

700
00:49:01,596 --> 00:49:03,632
Nice to see you all
during the daytime.

701
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:22,184
Violet.

702
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:28,820
Crayons. Crayons.

703
00:49:28,822 --> 00:49:32,991
Where the fuck...?
Where the fuck are the crayons?

704
00:49:32,993 --> 00:49:36,262
The fuck...
Where's... Where...?

705
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,795
Where are the fucking...?

706
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:39,831
Where?

707
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,666
Where did you fucking
put them?

708
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:44,703
Where did you put them?
Where did you fucking put them?

709
00:49:44,705 --> 00:49:46,505
Where the fuck...
Get out!

710
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:47,542
Fuck!

711
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,545
Where the fuck...
Where the fuck?

712
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:56,514
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck!

713
00:49:56,516 --> 00:49:58,683
Sawyer. Sawyer.

714
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:00,753
Sawyer,
you need to calm down.

715
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:03,454
Calm down, Sawyer.

716
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:05,791
Calm down. Calm down.

717
00:50:12,732 --> 00:50:14,301
No.

718
00:50:24,545 --> 00:50:26,811
Maintenance!

719
00:50:26,813 --> 00:50:28,250
What the fuck?

720
00:50:41,027 --> 00:50:43,329
I didn't call maintenance.

721
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,665
W-We're checking
all the AC units, ma'am.

722
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,034
Uh, there was a critical fault

723
00:50:49,036 --> 00:50:51,770
in the wiring in one
of the other rooms.

724
00:50:51,772 --> 00:50:54,806
Nearly started
an electrical fire.

725
00:50:54,808 --> 00:50:56,477
Just to be safe.

726
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:03,782
Thank you.

727
00:51:03,784 --> 00:51:05,416
This will just take a minute.

728
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:07,686
<i>We had an issue
with the Valentini girl.</i>

729
00:51:07,688 --> 00:51:09,987
<i>She got a megadose of
methylphenidate this morning</i>

730
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:11,924
<i>instead of her
risperidone and lithium.</i>

731
00:51:11,926 --> 00:51:13,925
My Lord.

732
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:16,494
I'm still not sure
how it happened.

733
00:51:16,496 --> 00:51:19,630
Everybody's
so overworked around here.

734
00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:23,402
I'm sure an oversight is bound
to happen every now and again.

735
00:51:23,404 --> 00:51:25,536
- Is she okay?
- Better now.

736
00:51:25,538 --> 00:51:27,672
But it can't
happen again.

737
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:32,578
Double-check the meds against Dr. Hawthorne's
list for each and every patient.

738
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,813
Of course. Understood.

739
00:51:34,815 --> 00:51:38,851
Something like this happens again,
we could all lose our jobs.

740
00:51:38,853 --> 00:51:41,018
Nurse,
I won't let you down.

741
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,690
This... This job
means the world to me.

742
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:47,925
I know. Your work
ethic is unreal.

743
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:50,728
You're here day and night.
We could use more like you.

744
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,831
You're a gift from God,
George.

745
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:56,971
Yeah. Just trying to make sure all these
folks get the help that they deserve.

746
00:51:58,139 --> 00:51:59,541
Hey.

747
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:03,411
So, uh...

748
00:52:04,712 --> 00:52:07,679
I think
you broke the TV.

749
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:08,983
No.

750
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:13,788
God, I didn't mean to.

751
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,659
I love TV.

752
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:23,195
- I must be insane.
- Oh, no, no.

753
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:25,096
You're not insane.

754
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:27,733
I know the difference between
people who are supposed to be here

755
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,735
and the people
that end up here,

756
00:52:29,737 --> 00:52:31,703
and you're definitely
in column two.

757
00:52:31,705 --> 00:52:33,574
Oh.

758
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:38,210
Oh, I feel like
I belong in column one.

759
00:52:38,212 --> 00:52:40,779
Ohh. What?

760
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:42,780
Come on.

761
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:44,853
You didn't think so
yesterday, so, uh,

762
00:52:45,886 --> 00:52:47,489
what changed?

763
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,724
What did you want to be
when you were a kid?

764
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:53,858
- Me?
- Mm.

765
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,194
Shit!

766
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:57,061
I wanted to be
an astronaut.

767
00:52:57,063 --> 00:52:59,498
Yep.

768
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,067
But, uh, I found out
that, you know,

769
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:04,603
you had to deal with all
these numbers and shit,

770
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:07,038
and, uh,
I'm trash at math, so...

771
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,842
Didn't work out.

772
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:12,945
- There's still time.
- Yeah. Sure there is.

773
00:53:12,947 --> 00:53:16,047
Go to University of Phoenix, right? Maybe I'll do that.

774
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:17,651
What about you?

775
00:53:18,886 --> 00:53:21,152
- It's too late for me.
- Nah.

776
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:25,190
I was going to be
this renegade medical student

777
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:27,592
who was able to
pinpoint diseases

778
00:53:27,594 --> 00:53:30,128
that all the old traditional
surgeons couldn't see.

779
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,762
- Oh, okay.
- Mm.

780
00:53:31,764 --> 00:53:35,666
It's a nice fantasy,
but I had no follow-through.

781
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:37,869
I-I had... I mean,
I had the ambition,

782
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:41,639
but I didn't have the drive
or the dedication to make it.

783
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:44,009
- Oh.
- I couldn't even make it through pre-med.

784
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:47,712
- Mmm.
- I had to switch majors when I was a junior.

785
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:52,217
But I still wanted
to do something, you know,

786
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:54,286
so I volunteered
at a hospice.

787
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:57,088
- Uh, well?
- Mmm.

788
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,857
That's where
I met David Strine.

789
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:00,992
"Most companies settle
with the government,

790
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:04,096
but several area cases involving
more than two dozen power plants

791
00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:06,764
in the South and Midwest
are still pending.

792
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:08,733
Remaining suits demand fines
for the past..."

793
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:11,270
<i>He was nice, you know?</i>

794
00:54:11,272 --> 00:54:13,674
<i>Quiet, uncomfortable.</i>

795
00:54:14,842 --> 00:54:16,741
<i>And I felt bad.</i>

796
00:54:16,743 --> 00:54:18,710
<i>I mean, how do you
spend two hours a week</i>

797
00:54:18,712 --> 00:54:22,116
<i>talking to your father
who doesn't even recognize you?</i>

798
00:54:24,817 --> 00:54:26,553
<i>My father died when I was 15.</i>

799
00:54:28,022 --> 00:54:30,855
- <i>Respiratory failure.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

800
00:54:30,857 --> 00:54:32,259
<i>No one saw it coming.</i>

801
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,329
<i>So while I was fantasizing
about being the savior</i>

802
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:39,834
<i>who would pull his father
back to clarity...</i>

803
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:43,103
<i>David was having
his own fantasies.</i>

804
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:50,777
He would want us
to be together.

805
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:33,445
<i>Okay, let's
talk about Sawyer Valentini</i>

806
00:56:33,447 --> 00:56:35,380
<i>in Boston, year zero.</i>

807
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:40,217
<i>Um, obviously I would recommend sensors
on all your doors and windows.</i>

808
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:43,121
<i>I would swap the terrace doors
out for a steel-core door.</i>

809
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:46,358
<i>Um, update your dead bolts.</i>

810
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,027
<i>Uh, I want to talk to you about
situational awareness, okay?</i>

811
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:50,395
<i>Where's the nearest
police station?</i>

812
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:52,264
<i>Where's the nearest
fire station?</i>

813
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:55,000
<i>These are things that should always
be right on the tip of your tongue.</i>

814
00:56:55,002 --> 00:56:57,302
<i>Yeah, parking...
Um, I know you have parking</i>

815
00:56:57,304 --> 00:56:59,371
<i>in the rear of the building
with the back entrance.</i>

816
00:56:59,373 --> 00:57:01,172
<i>I'm gonna ask you
not to use that anymore.</i>

817
00:57:01,174 --> 00:57:03,175
<i>I know it's convenient,</i>

818
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:06,143
<i>but I would advocate selling your
car and using a ride service.</i>

819
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:10,081
<i>If you can't or won't do that, uh,
I would say park on the street,</i>

820
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,050
preferably
under a light source.

821
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:15,420
And come back and walk through this
courtyard here where people can see you.

822
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:17,021
With your keys
in your hand, by the way.

823
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:19,157
You want your keys
always in your hand.

824
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,427
You don't want to be digging around in
your purse in the dark for your keys.

825
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:25,730
Um, and I'll talk to you about
and help you with a go-bag.

826
00:57:25,732 --> 00:57:29,300
You know, just cash, credit
cards, uh, change of clothes,

827
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:31,770
flashlight, charger,
that kind of thing.

828
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:34,840
A firearm,
if you're open to that idea

829
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:37,375
of purchasing or registering a
firearm and learning how to use it.

830
00:57:37,377 --> 00:57:39,744
Think about altering
your routine.

831
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:42,880
Uh, when you go to work, when you
leave work, um, that kind of thing.

832
00:57:42,882 --> 00:57:46,083
How about social media? Are you
on any social media accounts?

833
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:50,355
Uh, I'm on Facebook,
but my account's private, so...

834
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:53,291
Right. Okay, that's no good,
because he'd be able

835
00:57:53,293 --> 00:57:58,029
to, you know, figure out a friend
of yours from marching band

836
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:01,967
or a sorority sister
and go get photos from them,

837
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:05,270
create a bogus account and then
try to friend you that way.

838
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:07,773
Your friends know your e-mail.
Just... That's enough.

839
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,007
Just delete the Facebook
today.

840
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:12,210
Um, and then talk
to your friends, you know.

841
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:15,313
Be open about this. Inform them what's
going on. Tell them not to mention you.

842
00:58:15,315 --> 00:58:17,415
Don't tag you on Instagram.

843
00:58:17,417 --> 00:58:19,951
You know, uh, um...

844
00:58:19,953 --> 00:58:23,788
You know, baby showers or, you know,
Chardonnay date with the girls.

845
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:26,056
You know, whatever it is, if
there's someone taking a picture,

846
00:58:26,058 --> 00:58:28,492
you do whatever you can
to get out of it, all right?

847
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:31,563
And think of your cell phone
as your enemy.

848
00:58:31,565 --> 00:58:34,802
And this: your new best friend.

849
00:58:38,572 --> 00:58:39,974
<i>And now he's here.</i>

850
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,242
Or maybe it's all in my head.

851
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:49,350
Hey, come here.
Come here.

852
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,354
- Hey.
- Hmm?

853
00:58:55,455 --> 00:58:57,355
Column two.

854
00:58:57,357 --> 00:59:00,291
For life.

855
00:59:00,293 --> 00:59:02,960
Give me some. Give me some now.
Come on.

856
00:59:02,962 --> 00:59:05,197
- Ahh, hey!
- Hey.

857
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:07,401
You've been to the hood
a couple times, huh?

858
00:59:20,547 --> 00:59:22,382
Sawyer.

859
00:59:24,418 --> 00:59:26,253
I'm sorry you've had
such a rough day.

860
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:43,070
- Sweet dreams.
- Drop dead.

861
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:14,498
<i>I need to use your phone.</i>

862
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,668
- Now!
- God, hey!

863
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,005
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I need to use it now.

864
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:21,639
Okay.

865
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,910
Geez, just keep
your voice down.

866
01:00:25,444 --> 01:00:28,048
- Everyone's fucking asleep.
- What?

867
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:31,918
<i>Hi, can I have
Angela Valentini's room, please?</i>

868
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,188
Yep.

869
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:45,697
Mom, hi, it's me.
I left a message on your cell.

870
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:48,266
Can-Can you just give me
a ring back as soon as possible?

871
01:00:48,268 --> 01:00:50,137
Thanks.

872
01:00:56,076 --> 01:00:57,478
Thank you.

873
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:00,614
Hey.

874
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:15,092
Man, I don't even know
if she's telling the truth or not.

875
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:19,063
I mean, some days she's normal, but
other days it's, like, I don't know.

876
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:20,901
Maybe I just been in here
too long.

877
01:01:22,601 --> 01:01:25,235
Forget all that. Look, I need you
to check on something for me.

878
01:01:25,237 --> 01:01:27,274
And not because I like her.

879
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:47,625
Get any calls last night?
This morning?

880
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:50,695
No calls, no texts,
no voice mails.

881
01:01:50,697 --> 01:01:52,529
Shit.

882
01:01:52,531 --> 01:01:55,199
My mom didn't pick up
last night.

883
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:57,404
Not her cell,
not her motel room.

884
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:01,038
Moms call back.
That's what they do.

885
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,008
Yeah.

886
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:08,346
Hey. What's this, like,
day five in here for you?

887
01:02:08,348 --> 01:02:10,614
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, focus on that.

888
01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:12,282
You've done
most your time.

889
01:02:12,284 --> 01:02:14,351
It's all downhill
from here.

890
01:02:14,353 --> 01:02:17,788
Just keep your head down
for a few more days.

891
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,556
And you're free.

892
01:02:19,558 --> 01:02:22,427
And I promise you,
on that date,

893
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:25,797
your mom will be standing
right there waiting for you.

894
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:27,301
Smiles!

895
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:32,036
- You're a good person.
- Ha!

896
01:02:32,038 --> 01:02:33,570
I do a decent
impression of one.

897
01:02:33,572 --> 01:02:35,507
Don't tell nobody,
all right?

898
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:37,741
How long have you got
left in here?

899
01:02:37,743 --> 01:02:41,712
Well...

900
01:02:41,714 --> 01:02:46,150
The opioid withdrawal program
is a four-week project.

901
01:02:46,152 --> 01:02:49,621
I've done three weeks,
so, I got one week left.

902
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:52,460
So, uh, I get out
a few days after you.

903
01:02:54,194 --> 01:02:55,427
- We should maybe...
- No!

904
01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:56,527
- No?
- No.

905
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:58,762
- Okay.
- I don't know.

906
01:02:58,764 --> 01:03:01,599
I mean, it's completely
different on the outside.

907
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:03,701
Plus, you'll have
your own phone.

908
01:03:03,703 --> 01:03:06,340
My usefulness to you will
be dramatically reduced.

909
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,706
You've been a friend to me.

910
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:12,509
- And I'd like the opportunity to be one for you.
- Okay.

911
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:15,212
- If you let me.
- Yeah.

912
01:03:15,214 --> 01:03:20,184
Once you're free, you might have a
completely different perspective.

913
01:03:20,186 --> 01:03:21,652
And I don't blame you.

914
01:03:21,654 --> 01:03:23,757
But should
that not happen...

915
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,128
maybe you'll let me
use your phone.

916
01:03:30,362 --> 01:03:31,498
Maybe.

917
01:04:17,243 --> 01:04:19,277
No hidden phones.

918
01:04:21,281 --> 01:04:25,683
No personal relationships that can
impede upon another patient's recovery.

919
01:04:25,685 --> 01:04:28,719
What's wrong with you, man?
What the fuck, man?

920
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:38,663
What the fuck, man?

921
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:39,867
Ooh!

922
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:53,677
That's right, baby girl.

923
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:56,213
Your boo didn't show up to group.

924
01:04:56,215 --> 01:04:58,583
Now he's blowing off lunch.

925
01:04:58,585 --> 01:05:01,219
You think it's you?

926
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:03,320
You think
it's your personality?

927
01:05:03,322 --> 01:05:04,822
Think it's your
little rat face?

928
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:06,523
Huh?

929
01:05:07,826 --> 01:05:10,494
- Fuck you!
- Ow!

930
01:05:10,496 --> 01:05:12,396
She had fucking
started it.

931
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:14,299
I don't feel safe
around her. No one does.

932
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:17,467
You don't know when she might snap.
She's fucking crazy!

933
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:19,139
I'm fine!

934
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:23,208
- I hate you!
- Well, I love you.

935
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,212
Your fucking face.

936
01:05:46,398 --> 01:05:48,599
Oh, fuck! Oh, my God!

937
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:50,701
Look what he's done!
No, no, no!

938
01:05:50,703 --> 01:05:52,637
She smuggled a phone.
That is not allowed.

939
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,471
- Look at the fucking phone!
- Get to bed!

940
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:56,840
Look what he's done!
I'm telling you... No, please!

941
01:05:56,842 --> 01:05:58,576
- No, wait!
- Hold her down!

942
01:05:58,578 --> 01:05:59,978
- No! Fuck you!
- Hold her down, guys.

943
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,246
Fuck you! No!

944
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:03,650
No!

945
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:57,238
Help!

946
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,550
A dead body
was discovered.

947
01:07:12,552 --> 01:07:13,784
Oh, my God. What?

948
01:07:13,786 --> 01:07:15,652
Nate Hoffman.

949
01:07:15,654 --> 01:07:18,322
His body was found
in the old ECT room.

950
01:07:18,324 --> 01:07:19,623
He OD'd.

951
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:21,893
Somehow got hold of
a shit-ton of fentanyl.

952
01:07:21,895 --> 01:07:24,462
Poor guy.
He was doing so well.

953
01:07:24,464 --> 01:07:26,764
Not a word of this
around the other patients.

954
01:07:26,766 --> 01:07:29,567
And you hear anyone else talking
about it, you shut it down.

955
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:30,704
Of course.

956
01:07:42,915 --> 01:07:45,550
I-I... I'm not gonna hurt you.

957
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:47,351
I'm not gonna touch you.

958
01:07:47,353 --> 01:07:49,889
I don't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

959
01:07:51,023 --> 01:07:53,027
I just want to be here
with you.

960
01:08:01,567 --> 01:08:03,569
Oh, I disconnected them.

961
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:07,904
You going to kill me?

962
01:08:10,944 --> 01:08:14,915
H-How could you even
ask me that?

963
01:08:17,517 --> 01:08:19,420
I love you so much.

964
01:08:20,853 --> 01:08:24,421
I mean, come on. You must
know that at this point.

965
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:28,493
From the moment we met,
I have loved you.

966
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:29,930
Did you kill Nate?

967
01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:39,436
Nate... Nate chose
what happened to him.

968
01:08:39,438 --> 01:08:42,439
Just like I choose
to protect you

969
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:45,510
from any and all threats
to your well-being.

970
01:08:45,512 --> 01:08:46,847
My mom?

971
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:51,584
What did you do?

972
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:55,051
Angela is like family to me.

973
01:08:55,053 --> 01:08:56,787
How did you get her ring?

974
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:58,088
She gave it to me.

975
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,826
No.

976
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:02,926
You're lying.

977
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:06,831
You're lying to my face
about my mother.

978
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:07,968
I told her about you.

979
01:09:10,136 --> 01:09:11,705
I told her what you are.

980
01:09:12,938 --> 01:09:14,575
She never would've...

981
01:09:18,544 --> 01:09:20,545
She came all the way
from Boston for me.

982
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:22,180
So did I.

983
01:09:22,182 --> 01:09:23,881
No, no.

984
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:26,850
She said she was coming back.
What did you do to her?

985
01:09:26,852 --> 01:09:29,757
We-We-We talked.

986
01:09:30,956 --> 01:09:33,224
Look, we shared
our feelings.

987
01:09:33,226 --> 01:09:37,464
She-She told me
how her and your father met.

988
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:42,667
And then I told her
how you and I met.

989
01:09:42,669 --> 01:09:45,036
And she said she wanted us
to have their ring.

990
01:09:45,038 --> 01:09:47,674
Oh, my God. God.

991
01:09:48,907 --> 01:09:51,208
Sawyer?

992
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:54,744
That ring can be as sacred
to you and me

993
01:09:54,746 --> 01:09:56,780
as it was
to Angela and Mike.

994
01:09:56,782 --> 01:09:59,516
Don't you fucking say his name!
Don't you ever say his name!

995
01:09:59,518 --> 01:10:01,018
- Sawyer.
- Help me!

996
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,586
Help!

997
01:10:02,588 --> 01:10:04,221
Fuck.

998
01:10:04,223 --> 01:10:06,957
Sawyer.

999
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:09,659
Look.

1000
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:13,530
I have this cabin in the
woods in New Hampshire,

1001
01:10:13,532 --> 01:10:16,533
in the White Mountains.

1002
01:10:16,535 --> 01:10:18,802
It-It's totally
off the grid.

1003
01:10:18,804 --> 01:10:23,274
It's got its own solar,
its own well. It's...

1004
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:25,446
It's so beautiful.

1005
01:10:27,813 --> 01:10:29,881
Sawyer, we could be happy.
We will...

1006
01:10:29,883 --> 01:10:31,716
We will... We will...
We will be happy.

1007
01:10:31,718 --> 01:10:33,917
We will never be happy!

1008
01:10:33,919 --> 01:10:36,456
You could never
make me happy.

1009
01:10:37,656 --> 01:10:41,091
Look at where we are, David.

1010
01:10:41,093 --> 01:10:42,829
Look at what you've done.

1011
01:10:46,132 --> 01:10:49,300
There is no path
to happiness from here.

1012
01:10:49,302 --> 01:10:50,938
For either of us.

1013
01:10:58,745 --> 01:11:00,547
Sawyer, I've seen you.

1014
01:11:02,749 --> 01:11:06,186
I-I've watched you at work. I've
seen you with your friends.

1015
01:11:07,687 --> 01:11:09,857
Y-You're not happy.

1016
01:11:12,592 --> 01:11:17,060
Y-You just float through life,
and nothing ever touches you.

1017
01:11:17,062 --> 01:11:19,764
And you try... You try
really hard to fit in.

1018
01:11:19,766 --> 01:11:21,799
I've seen that.
But you can't.

1019
01:11:21,801 --> 01:11:23,504
You can't because...

1020
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:29,340
there's a piece missing.

1021
01:11:29,342 --> 01:11:31,044
And you're what's missing?

1022
01:11:32,911 --> 01:11:34,213
Why not?

1023
01:11:36,848 --> 01:11:40,253
I fucking hate you is why.

1024
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:46,357
And I love you so much.

1025
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:48,792
You don't know
the first thing about me.

1026
01:11:51,697 --> 01:11:54,864
- How can you say that? We spent months together.
- No.

1027
01:11:54,866 --> 01:11:57,167
You were in the same room
while I talked to your father

1028
01:11:57,169 --> 01:12:00,805
because you had nothing
to say to him.

1029
01:12:00,807 --> 01:12:02,640
He didn't even know
I was there.

1030
01:12:02,642 --> 01:12:04,975
Yeah, well,
he was your father,

1031
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:09,048
and you couldn't think of
two words to say to him.

1032
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,350
You keep saying
that you love me,

1033
01:12:13,352 --> 01:12:15,685
but you're not capable
of loving anybody.

1034
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:18,756
Not true.

1035
01:12:18,758 --> 01:12:22,659
Losing his mind was the best thing
that could have happened to him.

1036
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:24,894
Do you think
he'd be proud of you?

1037
01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:27,398
How you've turned out?

1038
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,765
- Stop it.
- What?

1039
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:30,835
What? Too mean?

1040
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:32,369
Not the girl you love?

1041
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:35,171
- You don't fucking know me!
- I do!

1042
01:12:35,173 --> 01:12:37,742
Well, then love me
like this, David.

1043
01:12:37,744 --> 01:12:40,277
Love me like this.
Love me when I'm a bitch.

1044
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,681
Love me when I cheat. Love me when I
shut down. Love all the shit about me.

1045
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,850
That's not you.

1046
01:12:46,852 --> 01:12:50,289
That's what trying to make yourself like
everybody else in the world has done to you.

1047
01:12:51,891 --> 01:12:53,192
Really?

1048
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,329
You're a fucking simpleton.

1049
01:12:57,763 --> 01:12:59,363
Do you know that?

1050
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:02,699
- You are a fucking dunce.
- Sawyer.

1051
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:05,806
That sweet,
kind girl in your head?

1052
01:13:06,838 --> 01:13:08,140
That's not me.

1053
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,312
Can I ask you a question,
David?

1054
01:13:14,446 --> 01:13:16,083
Who did this to you?

1055
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:20,350
Who rejected you?

1056
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:23,887
Did she let you
down easy? Huh?

1057
01:13:23,889 --> 01:13:26,957
"I'm flattered, David, but I don't
want to ruin our friendship."

1058
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:29,025
She ghost you? Hmm?

1059
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:30,860
- She block your number?
- Stop.

1060
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:32,462
She unfriend you
on Facebook?

1061
01:13:32,464 --> 01:13:34,230
Vanish from your life?

1062
01:13:34,232 --> 01:13:36,966
Or was it worse?

1063
01:13:36,968 --> 01:13:40,770
Did she look like she was
going to be sick? Hmm?

1064
01:13:40,772 --> 01:13:44,007
- Did she laugh in your face? Did she tell all her friends?
- It's not you.

1065
01:13:44,009 --> 01:13:46,810
No? 'Cause I'm telling you, David.
That's me.

1066
01:13:46,812 --> 01:13:49,079
That's what I would've done.
That's what I did.

1067
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:52,116
That's who you love.
That's who you fucking dream of.

1068
01:13:52,118 --> 01:13:54,417
That's who you've been stalking
for the past two years!

1069
01:13:54,419 --> 01:13:57,354
Am I everything you'd
hoped I'd be, David? Hmm?

1070
01:13:57,356 --> 01:14:01,091
Is this what you imagine when you dream
of us living in your fucking cabin?

1071
01:14:01,093 --> 01:14:03,394
Two years!

1072
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:05,162
- Two years, David.
- Shh!

1073
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:07,064
- What a waste.
- You don't mean this.

1074
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:10,333
What a fucking waste. You could've
met someone else in that time.

1075
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:13,369
- You know? People are pretty pathetic.
- I love you.

1076
01:14:13,371 --> 01:14:17,207
Child-killers gets visits from
women who see the good in them.

1077
01:14:17,209 --> 01:14:20,510
Someone who loves a child-killer might
be able to see some good in you.

1078
01:14:20,512 --> 01:14:22,512
Because no one else fucking could.

1079
01:14:22,514 --> 01:14:24,180
No one else could, David.

1080
01:14:24,182 --> 01:14:25,783
No one else...

1081
01:14:28,053 --> 01:14:30,354
Do it. Fucking do it.

1082
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:45,771
Now I see, David.

1083
01:14:47,272 --> 01:14:49,208
Now I see how you love me.

1084
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,937
Check this out.

1085
01:15:22,542 --> 01:15:24,244
Our friend Nate
was taking notes.

1086
01:15:26,012 --> 01:15:29,380
All the shady stuff
that happens down here.

1087
01:15:29,382 --> 01:15:31,849
He's gonna need
a bigger notebook.

1088
01:15:31,851 --> 01:15:33,487
Second floor
should see this.

1089
01:16:38,284 --> 01:16:41,420
Um, you did the right thing
bringing this to me.

1090
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:57,904
Good morning.

1091
01:17:01,072 --> 01:17:02,209
I...

1092
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:05,911
I brought you
breakfast.

1093
01:17:09,682 --> 01:17:12,082
It's your favorite.

1094
01:17:12,084 --> 01:17:15,956
Two egg, bacon and cheese biscuit,
hash browns, large coffee.

1095
01:17:17,389 --> 01:17:20,925
You ate that at your desk
every morning.

1096
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:24,161
You telling me that just killed
what little appetite I had.

1097
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:25,498
Yeah.

1098
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,469
Most important meal
of the day.

1099
01:17:57,562 --> 01:18:00,096
Thanks for this.

1100
01:18:00,098 --> 01:18:01,500
You're welcome.

1101
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:07,640
I'm not used to people
being so considerate.

1102
01:18:10,676 --> 01:18:12,609
Most of the guys I know

1103
01:18:12,611 --> 01:18:18,084
would neither know nor remember
what I have for breakfast.

1104
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,120
I know everything
about you.

1105
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:24,988
I know your favorite book.

1106
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:27,291
It's <i>Pale Fire.</i>

1107
01:18:27,293 --> 01:18:30,760
Your favorite song, "Walking
After Midnight" by Patsy Cline.

1108
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:32,395
Yeah.

1109
01:18:32,397 --> 01:18:34,400
My dad used to play it
around the house.

1110
01:18:36,267 --> 01:18:38,534
I know you want to go
to Portugal.

1111
01:18:38,536 --> 01:18:41,137
You had your favorite vacation
there when you were 12.

1112
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:42,542
Okay, enough.

1113
01:18:45,143 --> 01:18:46,545
Maybe you do know me.

1114
01:18:59,525 --> 01:19:02,161
You know you can't keep me
down here indefinitely.

1115
01:19:03,762 --> 01:19:05,561
People are going to be
looking for me.

1116
01:19:05,563 --> 01:19:08,468
My mom, my job.

1117
01:19:09,768 --> 01:19:12,304
You could call your mom
from the cabin.

1118
01:19:14,272 --> 01:19:16,308
You really want to go back
to that job?

1119
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,612
How are we going to live,
David?

1120
01:19:20,812 --> 01:19:22,147
You secretly rich?

1121
01:19:23,782 --> 01:19:28,118
There's this old diner
that's for sale, by the cabin.

1122
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,489
I was thinking
we could renovate it.

1123
01:19:31,624 --> 01:19:33,390
You've thought of everything.

1124
01:19:33,392 --> 01:19:35,658
I think of us
all the time.

1125
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,596
How are you going to explain
my absence from the ward?

1126
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:43,169
I already changed
the duration of your stay.

1127
01:19:44,637 --> 01:19:46,670
As far as
the administration knows,

1128
01:19:46,672 --> 01:19:50,243
they think your insurance already
ran out and that you're gone.

1129
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:55,615
There's a back door...

1130
01:19:57,215 --> 01:19:58,785
leads out to the woods.

1131
01:20:00,386 --> 01:20:02,088
We could go right now.

1132
01:20:03,722 --> 01:20:05,358
What if I say no?

1133
01:20:07,325 --> 01:20:09,094
What if I say let me go...

1134
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:13,296
and we'll start over.

1135
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:15,234
We'll go out for drinks,
get to know each other.

1136
01:20:17,268 --> 01:20:19,204
I'd lose you.

1137
01:20:21,139 --> 01:20:22,508
You know that.

1138
01:20:25,311 --> 01:20:28,380
You'd go back
to your old life.

1139
01:20:29,748 --> 01:20:31,747
And I-I don't fit there.

1140
01:20:31,749 --> 01:20:33,652
I only belong with you.

1141
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:40,659
I know it's a lot.

1142
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:43,663
It's not that, Da...

1143
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:47,333
It's not only that.

1144
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:51,838
God, I don't know
how to say this.

1145
01:20:53,405 --> 01:20:54,541
W-What?

1146
01:20:56,241 --> 01:20:58,311
Sawyer,
you can say anything.

1147
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:10,789
Have you ever...

1148
01:21:13,859 --> 01:21:15,562
Have you ever been
with anyone else?

1149
01:21:18,297 --> 01:21:20,532
Beyond your feelings for me,
have you ever...

1150
01:21:22,433 --> 01:21:24,169
had sex with anyone?

1151
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:29,542
I'm not judging.
I'm not. It's just...

1152
01:21:31,209 --> 01:21:33,346
Fantasy and reality
are two different things.

1153
01:21:35,213 --> 01:21:36,850
I might not be
what you want.

1154
01:21:38,717 --> 01:21:40,917
You're all I've ever wanted.

1155
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:43,188
You've got nothing
to compare me to.

1156
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:47,224
That makes no sense.

1157
01:21:47,226 --> 01:21:50,894
I need you to see
what you've been missing,

1158
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:53,366
and then decide
if you still want me.

1159
01:21:55,834 --> 01:21:57,568
David,

1160
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:00,537
I might be your last,

1161
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:02,509
but I can't be your first.

1162
01:22:06,844 --> 01:22:08,878
Uh, n-no.

1163
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,814
No. No, sorry. No.

1164
01:22:11,816 --> 01:22:14,283
Well, you would
if you loved me.

1165
01:22:14,285 --> 01:22:15,985
You say all
the right things, David.

1166
01:22:15,987 --> 01:22:18,387
Or what you think
are the right things.

1167
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:22,492
Greeting card clichés and romance
novel declarations of love.

1168
01:22:22,494 --> 01:22:24,827
But that's not love.

1169
01:22:24,829 --> 01:22:27,831
Love is giving yourself over
to what someone else wants

1170
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:31,335
even if it goes against
everything you believe.

1171
01:22:31,337 --> 01:22:32,705
You say you love me.

1172
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:35,607
Prove it.

1173
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:41,246
How do I prove it?

1174
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:45,250
You brought me down here.

1175
01:22:47,518 --> 01:22:48,922
Bring someone else down here.

1176
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:55,727
Y-Y-You want me to...?

1177
01:22:57,362 --> 01:22:58,731
Fuck her in front of me.

1178
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:03,436
I can't do that.

1179
01:23:06,437 --> 01:23:08,704
When you're thinking
about our future,

1180
01:23:08,706 --> 01:23:11,677
the one you've been planning
and imagining for so long...

1181
01:23:13,879 --> 01:23:15,915
it's really not that much
to ask.

1182
01:23:17,883 --> 01:23:19,882
J-Just... Just...

1183
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:23,289
Just like
a random patient?

1184
01:23:24,356 --> 01:23:25,925
Violet.

1185
01:24:06,865 --> 01:24:08,064
Violet.

1186
01:24:08,066 --> 01:24:09,498
Hmm?

1187
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,068
Come on, wake up.
Come on.

1188
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:12,836
What? Where am I?

1189
01:24:12,838 --> 01:24:14,704
You're coming with me.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1190
01:24:14,706 --> 01:24:17,707
- Where are we going?
- It'll just take a minute.

1191
01:24:17,709 --> 01:24:20,543
Come on. We gotta do
some paperwork.

1192
01:24:20,545 --> 01:24:24,613
Okay.

1193
01:24:24,615 --> 01:24:26,018
Okay.

1194
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:36,426
- What do you got?
- Have a look.

1195
01:24:36,428 --> 01:24:38,898
Prints from the John Doe
in the park.

1196
01:24:40,365 --> 01:24:41,533
George Shaw?

1197
01:24:44,636 --> 01:24:46,036
We're almost there.

1198
01:24:46,038 --> 01:24:47,940
Okay.

1199
01:24:48,807 --> 01:24:50,677
Okay.

1200
01:24:53,678 --> 01:24:55,679
Ow!

1201
01:24:55,681 --> 01:24:58,748
What the fuck is that cunt
doing in here, huh?

1202
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,885
Never mind me.
Act like I'm not here.

1203
01:25:01,887 --> 01:25:03,619
I'm impressed.

1204
01:25:03,621 --> 01:25:06,021
What's going on, huh?

1205
01:25:06,023 --> 01:25:07,326
Do it.

1206
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:10,930
Show me.

1207
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:13,563
Huh?

1208
01:25:13,565 --> 01:25:15,866
No, no.
No, no, no. No!

1209
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:18,568
No! No, no, no!

1210
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:19,836
David,
shut her up.

1211
01:25:19,838 --> 01:25:21,938
- Shut her up.
- No!

1212
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:24,774
No, stop. Stop!

1213
01:25:24,776 --> 01:25:26,475
Violet, shh! Violet...

1214
01:25:28,946 --> 01:25:31,180
Hey, hey.

1215
01:25:31,182 --> 01:25:32,884
Hey. Violet.

1216
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,487
We all get lonely,
Violet.

1217
01:25:37,489 --> 01:25:39,588
You push enough people away,

1218
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:41,627
soon enough there's...
there's no one left.

1219
01:25:44,029 --> 01:25:46,430
I don't think you
wanted me to hate you.

1220
01:25:46,432 --> 01:25:47,633
Hmm?

1221
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:50,902
I think you wanted me
to notice you.

1222
01:25:53,806 --> 01:25:55,475
Here I am, Violet.

1223
01:25:57,176 --> 01:25:58,878
Here I am.

1224
01:26:10,955 --> 01:26:12,391
David.

1225
01:26:24,669 --> 01:26:26,202
Come on!

1226
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:27,671
Help!

1227
01:26:27,673 --> 01:26:29,639
No, Violet!
No fucking way!

1228
01:26:29,641 --> 01:26:31,006
- Move!
- Let me out!

1229
01:26:31,008 --> 01:26:32,809
No, no, no!

1230
01:26:32,811 --> 01:26:35,148
No, no, no!

1231
01:29:22,179 --> 01:29:23,848
Hi, Mom.

1232
01:30:05,456 --> 01:30:07,823
<i>We sent Nate
to follow up on rumors</i>

1233
01:30:07,825 --> 01:30:11,127
<i>that the hospital was committing
patients against their will.</i>

1234
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:14,197
<i>I never thought this would be the
last story he ever wrote for us.</i>

1235
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:18,100
<i>It's a really tragic incident, and I hope it
draws attention to a very important issue.</i>

1236
01:30:18,102 --> 01:30:21,003
<i>ADS Health Enterprises,
Highland Creek's parent company,</i>

1237
01:30:21,005 --> 01:30:23,843
<i>has issued a blanket denial of the
allegations made in Mr. Hoffman's story.</i>

1238
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:29,115
You're only delaying
the inevitable, Sawyer!

1239
01:30:42,794 --> 01:30:45,228
There's not a word
of truth in these allegations.

1240
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:47,930
Highland Creek
and ADS Health Enterprises

1241
01:30:47,932 --> 01:30:50,332
pride themselves in
the care they take of patients.

1242
01:30:50,334 --> 01:30:53,403
To suggest otherwise is
outrageous and actionable.

1243
01:30:56,074 --> 01:30:57,974
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

1244
01:30:57,976 --> 01:30:59,844
Please direct any
further questions...

1245
01:31:02,047 --> 01:31:03,449
Miss Brighterhouse.

1246
01:31:06,485 --> 01:31:08,754
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

1247
01:31:16,361 --> 01:31:18,427
I'm proud of the work
we do here.

1248
01:31:18,429 --> 01:31:20,766
People leave Highland Creek
healthier than they come in.

1249
01:31:40,352 --> 01:31:42,321
No more running.

1250
01:31:43,254 --> 01:31:45,054
No more lying.

1251
01:31:45,056 --> 01:31:46,488
Ow!

1252
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:28,833
You look so beautiful
right now.

1253
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:35,140
Now I feel like I'm looking
at the real you.

1254
01:32:37,942 --> 01:32:42,114
That's the you that I saw
back at the hospice.

1255
01:32:46,517 --> 01:32:49,284
There's so many things
that I wanted to say to you,

1256
01:32:49,286 --> 01:32:51,423
all these things in my head.

1257
01:32:54,892 --> 01:32:56,328
But I-I froze up.

1258
01:33:01,633 --> 01:33:03,435
But now it's going to
be different...

1259
01:33:06,137 --> 01:33:07,907
'cause it's just you...

1260
01:33:09,307 --> 01:33:10,876
and me.

1261
01:33:20,451 --> 01:33:22,353
You'll learn to love me.

1262
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:31,463
A year from now...

1263
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:37,002
maybe... maybe two...

1264
01:33:39,036 --> 01:33:43,842
I was thinking that maybe we
could start a family of our own.

1265
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,913
What do you think
about that?

1266
01:33:49,313 --> 01:33:52,218
A little girl with your eyes
and your smile.

1267
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:55,855
Oh, that'd be perfect.

1268
01:33:58,222 --> 01:34:01,224
You'd make such
an amazing mother.

1269
01:34:27,451 --> 01:34:30,155
We are going to make sure,
from here on out...

1270
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:43,101
Can I have the key
to that desk, please?

1271
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:23,538
I can't believe we still have to
eat here after your big promotion.

1272
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:27,243
I mean, you've got
an expense account.

1273
01:35:27,245 --> 01:35:30,179
Just live it up.

1274
01:35:30,181 --> 01:35:31,650
Jill.

1275
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:36,387
I asked you here today
to tell you something serious.

1276
01:35:39,124 --> 01:35:42,324
The company wants to thank you
for all your hard work,

1277
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:45,563
but, uh,
it's time to move on.

1278
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,335
You need to
clear out your desk.

1279
01:35:51,736 --> 01:35:54,306
- You're so many assholes.
- Mm-hmm.

1280
01:35:55,306 --> 01:35:57,305
And you're paying
for lunch.

1281
01:35:57,307 --> 01:36:00,376
You love playing power games.

1282
01:36:00,378 --> 01:36:03,048
No. I just love
being the boss of you.

1283
01:36:11,356 --> 01:36:13,756
Jesus, be a bit
less obvious.

1284
01:36:13,758 --> 01:36:18,661
It's not just that she's
beautiful, it's that she's kind.

1285
01:36:18,663 --> 01:36:20,766
Even my father loves her,
and he doesn't like anyone.

1286
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:24,801
She works at a bank
during the day,

1287
01:36:24,803 --> 01:36:27,737
but on the weekends
she volunteers at a hospice.

1288
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:29,639
That's where I met her.

1289
01:36:29,641 --> 01:36:32,442
And, I don't know,
I just...

1290
01:36:32,444 --> 01:36:34,446
I feel like
she might be the one.

1291
01:36:36,114 --> 01:36:38,480
I can visualize myself

1292
01:36:38,482 --> 01:36:42,120
spending the rest of my life
with this girl.

1293
