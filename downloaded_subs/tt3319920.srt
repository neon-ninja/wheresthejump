1
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,190
Please God, help me.

2
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,359
Please God, help me.

3
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,808
Oh, you're already back,
John?

4
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,769
Oh-oh. What did our
boys break this time?

5
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,355
John!

6
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,043
Let's go in my office.

7
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,848
John, the reason I called you here...
take a seat will you?

8
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,150
Reverend Beaumont dropped by
a little while ago.

9
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,404
He said your daughter is living
in his church. Since when?

10
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,949
Since Tuesday.

11
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,413
This is very awkward.

12
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,791
He gave me this.

13
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,878
She signed it.

14
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,309
- Is there a problem, Boss?
- Shh.

15
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,916
This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October

16
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,920
the 14th, 1990.
State your full name.

17
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,506
- John Gray.
- And your occupation.

18
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,091
Auto mechanic.

19
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,719
Okay, well you already know me,
I already know you so...

20
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,848
...why don't we not play any games and you
can start by telling me why you're here.

21
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,852
Well I'm... I'm really confused
and I've been thinking about...

22
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,856
I've been thinking about this
all night. And I've been praying.

23
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,484
- Does that help? Praying?
- Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,363
But I don't know, you see.

25
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,241
Part of me says it's impossible.

26
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,620
I... I don't remember anything.

27
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,081
It's just impossible.

28
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,419
All right, well then
what is the other part say?

29
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,548
Some things are obvious.

30
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,470
Such as?

31
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,391
First of all I'm completely sure
about one thing.

32
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,686
Angela never lies.

33
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,815
She'd never do that.
Her mother was just like her, a saint.

34
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,110
And I don't know. Little details
like not hugging or kissing me.

35
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,946
So she's...
she's been avoiding you?

36
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,656
Yeah.

37
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,701
And then... also the...

38
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,411
John.

39
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,331
Cut the shit,
take your hat off first of all.

40
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,291
- What?
- Take your hat off.

41
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,046
Why do you think she
was avoiding you, John?

42
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,803
Cause I did it.

43
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,308
I did it.

44
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,068
He admits it, but he doesn't remember
doing it? I don't get it.

45
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,905
He's just stalling for time. I need to talk
to the girl as soon as possible.

46
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,282
Reverend says she
doesn't want to see anybody.

47
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,535
Well I don't care about the Reverend,
right. We need a psychologist.

48
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,954
- A psychologist?
- We need a good one.

49
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,041
Lean on him until he breaks. Do your thing.

50
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,876
It's child abuse, Chief.

51
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,221
Mrs. Gray.

52
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,725
I'll make you some tea, okay?

53
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,896
Mrs. Gray.

54
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,732
Did you know?

55
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,155
The Reverend called me and told me.

56
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,949
But I...

57
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,995
I talked to my son, and...

58
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,748
he flew into a rage. He denied everything.

59
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,878
Reverend, please...
I need to see her.

60
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,797
We've already discussed that, Rose.

61
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,675
She'd rather stay at the church.

62
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,846
Mrs. Gray. You think it would all right if
I went, took a look at Angela's room?

63
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,599
- It's upstairs.
- Thank you.

64
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,980
It's the last door.

65
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,983
- What?
- It's the last door.

66
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,994
Hey Bruce.

67
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,746
This isn't right, we
need a warrant.

68
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,666
She gave us permission. Are you asleep?
Where's the son?

69
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,836
Roy? He left two years ago.

70
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,257
Where'd he go?

71
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,303
You don't know?

72
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,309
You're friends with the family and
you don't know where he went?

73
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,147
They've suffered a lot,
I wouldn't bring that up.

74
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,940
Mrs. Gray.

75
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,819
Have you heard from your grandson?

76
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:18,783
Not really. He calls sometimes
to say he's okay.

77
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,869
But...

78
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,998
Why did he leave? You think
he was running from his father?

79
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,752
I asked my son last night.

80
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,462
And what did he say?

81
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,380
He took my hand...

82
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,133
And...

83
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,886
we prayed.

84
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,355
It's not an urban legend.
The Satanists are living among us.

85
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,358
Like any religious group,
they worship their lord,

86
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,945
the Devil, and perform horrible rituals.
The question we should ask ourselves...

87
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,823
How can you listen to this right now.
Can I turn it off?

88
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,201
No, turn it off.
It's your car.

89
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:09,167
John... I knew he had problems
but molesting his daughter?

90
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,379
- I can't believe it.
- Why not?

91
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,173
Because you both go to the same church?

92
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,970
What if? I mean what if...
...it was a caress.

93
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,764
A show of affection?

94
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,519
His daughter exaggerated it.
She's kind of difficult.

95
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,854
Really?
That's not what I hear.

96
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,982
- Said she's a little shy.
- I saw her grow up, Bruce.

97
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,445
You've seen that house,
you've seen the way that they live.

98
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,614
On top of that,
she lost her mom.

99
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,034
She's had a pretty shitty life.

100
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,203
Maybe she just...

101
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,290
wanted to get away from it all.
I don't know.

102
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,545
Well still, I mean you really think
a seventeen year old girl is going to...

103
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,258
...put her dad in prison just because
she wants to change her life?

104
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,552
We can't rule that out.

105
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,513
Right?

106
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,349
Yeah right, can't rule it out.

107
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,775
The boy calls his grandmother from a bar.

108
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,236
Trace one of those calls damn it.

109
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,197
Don't call me again until you find him.

110
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,533
Well?

111
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,120
Well umm..

112
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:32,167
- His mental state appears to be normal.
- I already told you that.

113
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,794
Big question is, why the sudden amnesia?

114
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,089
No one's going to believe him.
Bruce. Mr. Raines is here.

115
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,341
Don't think he's after anything.

116
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,509
What?

117
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,803
If he doesn't want a lawyer, then he isn't

118
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,598
- trying to protect himself, right?
- I don't understand.

119
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,725
- Bruce!
- Yeah, I'm right here.

120
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,437
Say that again, professor, will ya.
I'm a bit of a dummy sometimes.

121
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,356
I don't think what John is doing
is a strategy,

122
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,651
on the contrary I think
he's trying to cooperate.

123
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,530
He keeps saying: I think I did it.
But speaks like he wasn't there.

124
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,949
And to a certain
extent, he wasn't.

125
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:10,246
See this is a man who has spent years
trying to stop drinking.

126
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,875
And he does it by giving in to faith
which is an explosive combination.

127
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,379
Because on the one hand,
he goes too far, does awful things.

128
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,927
On the other hand he can't live
with the awful things he's done. So now...

129
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,513
...he can't find them in his head.

130
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,435
- He can't find them?
- He's repressed them.

131
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,562
The memories are behind some doors.

132
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,317
It's not that difficult to find a key
and free them. Provoke a regression.

133
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,238
Look, I'm not an expert.
But, I don't know.

134
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:47,033
- This all seems a little...
- It seems a little strange, doesn't it?

135
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:52,705
I suppose umm... I often tell my students
that the mind is a whole universe.

136
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,792
I read an article about this.

137
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,004
Regressive hypnosis has made
great progress, gentlemen.

138
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,799
Anyway, I hope you didn't...

139
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,345
...interrupt my classes,
to discuss these topics with me.

140
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,099
Or did you?

141
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,273
I've been very confused ever since.

142
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,985
My father ordered me
not to tell anyone.

143
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,239
He said, be a good girl and the Lord
will watch over you.

144
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,117
But I know this is wrong.

145
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,746
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him.

146
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,084
I'm scared,
I don't know if I should.

147
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,421
Okay. John, again.
Concentrate

148
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,134
on the first sentence. Last year
my father started coming into my room.

149
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,388
Last year...

150
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,727
Remember what I said, John,
let the pendulum clear your mind.

151
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,645
Look through it.

152
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,610
This is no use.

153
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,904
How long are we going to keep doing this?

154
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,740
Just one more time.
Let yourself go.

155
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,745
I want you to relax every muscle
in your body.

156
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,663
Third sentence.

157
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:22,003
My father ordered me not to tell anyone.
He said, be a good girl

158
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,172
and the Lord will
watch over you.

159
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,634
...and the Lord will watch over you.
Yes, I said that.

160
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,761
I said that to her plenty of times.
But...

161
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,597
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him.

162
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,601
Your daughter wrote this. Right?
You realize that?

163
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,605
It's her handwriting, John.

164
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,983
You yourself said, your
daughter never lies.

165
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,778
No, she would never lie.
She would never lie to me.

166
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,405
Well she must be, and
if you don't remember it...

167
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,408
Oh God! God please...

168
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,536
- Oh God help me I...
- John.

169
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,790
John.

170
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,836
Behind the pendulum...

171
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,590
Right behind...

172
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,936
Oh wait, wait-wait-wait.

173
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,313
I think I see something.

174
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,274
Okay, John. Tell us what you see.

175
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,696
I see... is it my house?
And I'm moving.

176
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,908
Jesus. Jesus it's just like I was there.

177
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,871
Just read it again, please.

178
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,793
Last year, my father
started coming into my room.

179
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,880
I've been very confused ever since.

180
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,343
He touches me and
forces me to have sex with him.

181
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,221
I see her.
She's sitting there on the bed.

182
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,893
I'm on top of her, Jesus!

183
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,105
- God no!
- What are you doing to her?

184
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,608
I tied her hands to the
headboard.

185
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,527
You're tying her?
Can you see the rope?

186
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,363
Yeah... Yeah it's a rope.
It's a black rope.

187
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,408
Why is it black? Is it some type of ritual?

188
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,454
Hold on. Hold on. Now he's...
I'm tying her feet!

189
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,124
Wait, wait. You said "he".
Where are you watching this from?

190
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,627
I'm right there,
I'm standing right there by the bed.

191
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,759
- Are you seeing yourself?
- I guess. It has to be me, right?

192
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,386
No, that's somebody else.
Focus on the face.

193
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,139
Why! Then why aren't I stopping it?

194
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,308
What the hell am I doing there!

195
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,935
Somebody you let in,
somebody you must know.

196
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,271
Why aren't I stopping
it! Jesus!

197
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,191
- Angela!
- A face, John. It's someone you know.

198
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,486
I don't know who it is!
It could be anybody!

199
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,988
Who has been in your
house in the last year?

200
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,324
- You know who it is, John...
- Detective...

201
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,748
I guess... I'm holding a camera...

202
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,752
I'm taking pictures!

203
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,380
Hold on just a second...
I see... I think I see.

204
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,219
It's George!

205
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,012
George Nesbitt?

206
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,473
- Okay...
- George Nesbitt?

207
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,647
Hey George!

208
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,734
Hey George.

209
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,447
Hey Bruce. How'd it go with John?

210
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,074
Where you doing?

211
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,159
Where do you think?
My shift is over.

212
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,083
Is there a problem?

213
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,878
Your name came up.

214
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,681
My name?

215
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,351
What'd he say?

216
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:10,690
You tell me, huh George.
You tell me.

217
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,280
What if I told you I just looked at all the
photos. Would you tell me you did it then?

218
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,533
- We have the photos.
- If you showed me.

219
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,621
Oh I get it...

220
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,838
Wait a minute, no. I'm not sure...
This is all really weird.

221
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,009
Five minutes ago I would have
never believed it. Now I wanna kill you.

222
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,887
- Give me your gun.
- Bruce, take it easy okay.

223
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,139
I am taking it easy.
Give me your gun.

224
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,849
What photos...

225
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,560
Now you don't know what
I'm talking about huh?

226
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,228
- Fuck!
- Son of a bitch!

227
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,989
Oh please. Give me a break,
you assaulted him without saying a word.

228
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,160
I would never do that Katie,
and you know that. You know he's lying.

229
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,121
That's enough.
Nesbitt is my client now.

230
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,624
And that whole thing
about the photos,

231
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:14,503
if you had them, you'd already
have shown them to me, don't you think?

232
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,715
So who's the one lying here, Bruce?

233
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,595
Without saying a word...
Do you hear this bull shit, Chief?

234
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,140
We need to talk to the girl.
If she identifies him.

235
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,351
Just hold your horses.

236
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,437
Sometimes I wish I was like you, Bruce.

237
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,147
For me this is all...

238
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,734
Nesbitt was one of our own.

239
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,364
Just remember that, okay.
Take your psychologist.

240
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,074
Thanks Chief.

241
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,245
We're leaving.

242
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,937
You suspected Nesbitt
before John said his name, why?

243
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,316
There was something off about him.
I am a Detective, Professor.

244
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,944
I see. Nevertheless,

245
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,615
But please do not interfere
with my therapy again.

246
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,244
You and your people can ask him
anything you like. But after that...

247
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,996
...it's my turn.

248
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,152
Oh hey. Hello Angela.

249
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,073
My name's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Please, have a seat.

250
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,582
We actually met before once
in your father's workshop.

251
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,002
You wouldn't remember,
you were... smaller.

252
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:25,217
We just want to have a little chat. This is
Professor Raines. He's our psychologist.

253
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,597
Angela, do you want me to stay?

254
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,565
We're just going to ask
you a few questions.

255
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,275
I'm not crazy.

256
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,903
No, of course not.

257
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,035
The reason I'm asking
so many questions is because...

258
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,831
We know there was
someone else in the room.

259
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,334
Your father told us.

260
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,044
But why?

261
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,090
Why did he say that?

262
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,134
I need you to look at
these photos closely.

263
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,928
I don't want to go on
with this.

264
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,389
Angela. These people hurt you.

265
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,141
And they could hurt
someone else.

266
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:18,270
Your father said something about a ritual?
What's all that about?

267
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:29,073
Would you like to write it down?
Sometimes that helps.

268
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,543
Alone.
I want to do it alone.

269
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,795
Okay.

270
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,469
She was always sad.

271
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,889
Like she was shutting herself in.

272
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,060
It was in one of our seminars.

273
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,480
...stay away from me
Satan, I have Jesus.

274
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,608
She just started crying all of a sudden.

275
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,861
Then I realized...

276
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,823
It was like, like God
had spoken to me.

277
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,868
I'd prefer to call that intuition,
Reverend.

278
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,955
Call it whatever you want.
But I knew it was her father.

279
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,835
And that it had happened
more than once.

280
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,413
Angela?

281
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,542
These things they did to you?

282
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,253
When they summoned the Devil.

283
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,258
Who else was there with your father?

284
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,094
Could you please tell me?
His name?

285
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,039
You did great.

286
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,221
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about Satanism.

287
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,932
Are you a man of faith?

288
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,269
I'm afraid I'm in no mood
to answer that question.

289
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,689
Agnostic. You want to believe,
but you can't.

290
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,192
Don't worry.
I went through that phase myself.

291
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,167
I got a hold of a copy.

292
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,093
You branded her with an inverted cross.

293
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,898
Now I'm starting to understand
why you came to us.

294
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,526
It wasn't to get over
your wife's death.

295
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,574
It was to desecrate our church.

296
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,410
Well Reverend,

297
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,163
I...

298
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,916
You don't know what I'm talking about.

299
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:12,546
You don't remember
the insults, or the torture?

300
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,715
Or the excrement or...

301
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,389
Okay John...
Just do us all a favour.

302
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,392
Try.

303
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,119
...as part of a ritual
involving black magic.

304
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:49,041
One of his accomplices could even belong
to the Hoyer Police Department.

305
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,585
And tonight,
don't miss our special segment...

306
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,421
Wonderful. That's what
I call not causing a panic.

307
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,633
...keep the people of
this city in suspense.

308
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,828
- Hello?
- It's Cleveland, turn on the TV.

309
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,122
Yeah, all right.
What channel?

310
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,293
Yeah. Give me a second.

311
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,888
We used to consider Satanic ritual abuse
something from the middle ages,

312
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,640
or literary fantasy.

313
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:52,354
But in the last few years,
books like this one have opened our eyes.

314
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:57,860
They branded his sign
on my back, said that I was his slave.

315
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,322
They made me attend
their ceremonies for 15 years.

316
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,742
One time I even saw
them sacrifice...

317
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,493
Yeah right I'll see you tomorrow.

318
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:11,123
Maybe it's easier to think people
aren't capable of doing things like this.

319
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,792
It's very sad.

320
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,361
No! No! I don't want to!

321
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:03,467
Okay, Angela says that
Nesbitt branded this...

322
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,470
...on her stomach with a knife.

323
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,349
John just corroborated it.
That's not all.

324
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,103
Now he remembers something about
a black cat and someone wearing a hood.

325
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,524
You can imagine what
I'm talking about.

326
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,778
Satanic Ritual Abuse.

327
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,781
How long will you detain
George without any proof?

328
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,201
He's a cop, we can detain him
as long as necessary.

329
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,747
Tom. Find this book.
Get everybody a copy.

330
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,376
- Everybody?
- S. Cooper, she was on TV last night.

331
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,087
- Can I make photocopies?
- Just a copy Tom.

332
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,048
We're poor... I had to say it.

333
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,262
Boss, I actually read that book.
But it seemed like a pile of trash to me.

334
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,765
Baby sacrifices and snuff movies? Come on.

335
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,892
The FBI would be
all over something like that.

336
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,769
Really? What do you
know about it?

337
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,896
Have you even
bothered to call the FBI?

338
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,607
No, but...

339
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,861
This case is a little bit more complicated

340
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,697
than taking a stroll
and handing out parking tickets.

341
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,450
We have to be on-point.
No mistakes.

342
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,619
Even if it's just this one time.

343
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,830
What's that mean,
just this one time.

344
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,416
Okay, okay. Enough! Enough!

345
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,252
Go on, get the job done.

346
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,054
I thought this was a quiet town.

347
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,266
Keep thinking of my granddaughters, Jesus.

348
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,855
You don't look too good.
You sleepin'?

349
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,650
I just get the feeling
with this case...

350
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,653
- What?
- I don't know.

351
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,865
That look in your eyes scares me.

352
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:55,537
It's a part of something bigger.
You know much bigger.

353
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,293
Charlie, how many times
did I say, knock first.

354
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,879
- Sorry Chief. Ahh, we found him.
- Who?

355
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,132
John's son. Roy.
He lives in Pittsburgh.

356
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,760
Okay. Where the hell is Tom?

357
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,723
Ask him, if our department
can afford two plane tickets to Pittsburgh.

358
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:33,992
- Your father told us.
- Why? Why did he say that?

359
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,995
I need you to look at
these photos closely.

360
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,832
- I don't want to go on with this.
- Angela, these people hurt you.

361
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,878
Do you make your wife listen to this
over and over again?

362
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:52,135
- We're separated.
- Well now you know why.

363
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,954
Hey Roy.

364
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,876
- A ritual?
- Yeah.

365
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,047
- It's a great story.
- Does it surprise you?

366
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,425
My father worships the devil?

367
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,387
What would you think?
Good girl.

368
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,850
Is that why you ran away?
To get away from him?

369
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,603
- Why don't you ask him.
- I did. That's why I'm here.

370
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,732
What about your mother?
Was she good to you?

371
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,028
Yeah. When she left us.

372
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,240
She killed herself... Did you know that?

373
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,494
I just know what it said in the report -
a car accident. A lapse at the wheel.

374
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,414
My Dad made her life hell for 20 years.

375
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,169
He's a drunk, you know,
it's probably not in the report.

376
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:12,174
He got us all involved in that Evangelical
stuff, like that would make things better.

377
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,636
Why don't you tell us about that.
What was he like when he drank?

378
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,640
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

379
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,895
Why don't you tell me
what he did to you and Angela.

380
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,440
Just forget it, okay.

381
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,734
I understand how these things
might be difficult...

382
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,361
They're things that didn't happen!

383
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,742
If they didn't happen, then why
do you need to raise your voice to say it.

384
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,662
You've been through something
very traumatic.

385
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,870
It's quite normal for the
mechanisms in the brain...

386
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,666
Are you deaf! Huh?

387
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,835
All right, take it easy okay.

388
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,880
Sit down. We're just talking.

389
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,386
Roy, I'm a police officer.

390
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,014
I'm going to tell you
what I'm looking at.

391
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,768
I'm looking at a young man.
Who doesn't speak to his sister.

392
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,063
Doesn't speak to his father.
And is living in an abandoned building.

393
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,107
What's wrong with you?

394
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,819
You need to stop fighting everybody
and find the real enemy,

395
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,863
the person who made you feel
exactly like him.

396
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,407
A loser.

397
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,249
I have a very simple
proposition for you, Roy.

398
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:32,003
Let's go back to your bedroom, search your
adolescence, even your childhood.

399
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:37,425
Review all those moments
that were... weird.

400
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,971
Weird? What do you mean weird?

401
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,307
We're looking for someone in a hood, Roy.

402
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,243
I hear voices.

403
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,455
Where?

404
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,627
Behind the door.
Whispering.

405
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,299
Which door are you talking about.

406
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,511
It's my old room.

407
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,015
It's opening.

408
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,810
I... I see them.

409
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,980
Wearing hoods.

410
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,192
Can you see your father?

411
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,237
I don't know.
I can't make out their faces.

412
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,698
Why not? Make up, maybe?

413
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,328
Yeah... they look like... witches.

414
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,830
What are they doing?

415
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,586
Come on, you know.

416
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,088
I don't know...

417
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:01,509
It's not what you think Roy.
It's what you don't want to think.

418
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,478
I don't know...

419
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,359
I can't stop...

420
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,703
Something doesn't fit.

421
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,250
In his vision, Roy saw himself as a child.
Yes?

422
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,212
And the other sister says the abuse
began only last year.

423
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,757
Yeah but see, for me that's the
typical progressive revelation.

424
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,969
For me, what doesn't fit is
he said there was six

425
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:48,848
people in his room. How do you get six
people in and out of that room without...

426
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,141
The grandmother.

427
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,603
And she had John when she was
barely sixteen years old.

428
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:59,234
Everybody knew she was into some bad stuff,
I see no reason for us to rule her out.

429
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,028
Of course I should have realized.

430
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,700
Some of us can use
our heads too, Professor.

431
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,602
- What is the meaning of all this!
- Mrs. Gray!

432
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,480
- You already searched the house yesterday.
- Rose. Rose.

433
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,400
- Today they're destroying it!
- You need to stay calm.

434
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,194
- Nobody has explained anything to me.
- Rose! Rose! Listen to me!

435
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,323
None of this is necessary. All right.

436
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,951
I'll talk to Brody and right now we'll
get these men out of your house.

437
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,579
Yeah? Well then why don't you?

438
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,959
You know where the photographs are.

439
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,004
I talked to Roy and he told us.

440
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,720
- You're lying!
- You are lying!

441
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,058
My Grandson didn't...

442
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,321
She's been drinking.

443
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,115
How you doin' boss?

444
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,954
Listen, Brody and I are
going bowling later.

445
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,792
You should join us.
Gonna blow off some steam.

446
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,503
What?

447
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,589
You need to disconnect, Boss.

448
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,762
Yeah, no thanks boys.
Don't you disconnect too much all right?

449
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,643
Are you a police officer?

450
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,353
Yes.

451
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,442
Did you sexually abuse Angela Gray?

452
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,612
No.

453
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,744
- Is today Friday?
- Yes.

454
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,666
- Did you sexually abuse Roy Gray.
- No.

455
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,212
An FBI report.

456
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,757
I hate it when you're always right.

457
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,427
This could be huge Bruce.

458
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,804
A cult of Satanists.

459
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,893
They've suspected it for seven years.
Ever since the book came out.

460
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,361
They shelved it last month,
can you believe it? I mean, take a look.

461
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,032
Rumours about rituals everywhere,
like they're connected.

462
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,952
But not a shred of evidence what-so-ever.

463
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,203
We'll find the proof.

464
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:01,541
Kate just called me,
if we don't find something,

465
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,336
- we're going to have to release him.
- What? Nesbitt?

466
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,838
It's the law, Bruce.

467
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,509
You mean that this guy is part of a
Satanic cult and we're going to let him go?

468
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,261
Do you know any pornographic
pictures of Angela Gray?

469
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,722
- No.
- You're lying!

470
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,935
Kenner speaking.

471
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,190
All we tried to do was
lift her shirt and she panicked.

472
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:35,617
Hey Angela, it's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Will you open the door?

473
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,302
Listen, Doctor just wants to
inspect your mark.

474
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,305
What's the problem?

475
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,560
- Would you prefer if it was a female?
- It's not that.

476
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,479
What is it?

477
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,607
Tell me, what is it?

478
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,823
If I show it to you, they'll kill me

479
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:26,876
You listen to me. Right now it's incredibly
important that you tell us everything.

480
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,379
We think that your grandmother...

481
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,842
Come on there were more
people there, with painted faces.

482
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,803
Why won't you confirm it?

483
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,806
The Devil is on their side.

484
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,683
The Devil doesn't exist.

485
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,522
There's good people, okay.
And there's bad people.

486
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,362
And unfortunately these
people are real scum.

487
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,199
But good people, like you,
are stronger than they are.

488
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,327
Yes you are.
People say that you're shy.

489
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:07,875
But I don't see that.
I see someone who is incredibly brave.

490
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:16,384
Someone who has been through living
hell and made it stop, all by yourself.

491
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:22,682
Now you just need to take
one more step, okay, and trust me.

492
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,604
Now they'll kill you too.

493
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,958
...their headlights woke me up.

494
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:36,297
I saw them get out of the cars,
and they were wearing robes.

495
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,803
They were headed for my
Dad's workshop.

496
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,184
After a while I heard
a knock at the door.

497
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,606
They were going to break it down
like the other times.

498
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,900
So I opened it.

499
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,860
Who were they?

500
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:05,660
It was my Grandmother,
dressed like them.

501
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,205
She took me downstairs.

502
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,670
She had this weird smile on her face.

503
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,216
- Like...
- Like she was drugged.

504
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,803
Yeah.

505
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,892
I saw that we were headed
for my Dad's workshop.

506
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,859
I could hear chanting and...

507
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,531
...squealing inside.

508
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,084
It was a black mass.

509
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:04,677
I know they were
doing stuff in the corners.

510
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,806
Like fornicating.

511
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,392
Torture.

512
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,148
There was blood, everywhere.

513
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,365
There was a woman with a pitcher.

514
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,371
She said, this isn't happening.
It's all a dream.

515
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:39,212
But there was like this altar.

516
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,841
And my Grandmother's:
"look at your Dad."

517
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:48,721
"It's his big night."

518
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,730
Then... they brought out a baby.

519
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,949
...and they each brought out a knife.

520
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,952
And they started stabbing it!

521
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,080
And they started eating it!

522
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,166
I know they did this
to other mothers of the sect.

523
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,753
They burned the remains and
buried them on my dad's property!

524
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,630
Please find them!

525
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,549
They got to be there.

526
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,979
...can't alter the bottom.
Okay. So just the grass...

527
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,466
- How long is it going to take?
- ...two or three inches...

528
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,109
Okay, it's very big.
We got to do it in sections.

529
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,570
- How long?
- We got to locate places where ditches...

530
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,457
- How long is it going to take?
- I don't know, Bruce, maybe a month!

531
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,158
You're all about not making any mistakes.
What are you doing? You come down here...

532
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,953
We don't have a month, Farrell!

533
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,373
Do you have any idea
what we are up against!

534
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,711
No, why would I? Why would I, Bruce?
You're the one with all the answers. Right?

535
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,088
You're right. You're right, okay.

536
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,343
Give this a listen. I already have it
memorized. Okay. Knock yourself out.

537
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,308
- What about the FBI?
- It's not going to lift a finger...

538
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,477
...until we have some hard evidence.
So we are on our own.

539
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,731
We got another call.
About twenty people in dark clothes.

540
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,233
- Somebody heard "weird music."
- Send someone over.

541
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,569
It's probably those Goth's again.

542
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,363
- Who do we send, Chief? Everybody's here.
- Find someone, Tom!

543
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:34,410
Call the D.A. and tell him we can't
keep this up. And shut that damn door.

544
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,247
All right. Professor Raines?

545
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,543
Well John is responding well to therapy.

546
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,589
But he hasn't been able to identify
any of the faces that he's sees.

547
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,592
- You think he's trying to buy time?
- No, no. I don't think so.

548
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:54,096
You know Chief, I don't think he's telling
us everything. Let me talk to him a bit.

549
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,973
Work him, try to get
something out of him.

550
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,310
You don't know what you're talking about.
Keep your mouth closed.

551
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,773
Angela, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?

552
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,567
I was looking for you.

553
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,653
All right. Well...

554
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,327
Please. Sit down.

555
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:28,255
- You're not going to believe me.
- What happened?

556
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,384
I think they were following me.

557
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,096
- Just now as I was leaving the bookstore.
- Well who was?

558
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,682
I don't know who they are. But...

559
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,895
I could feel 'em mixed in with
everyone on the street. Just...

560
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,981
Watching me.

561
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,069
- You don't believe me.
- It's not that, Angela.

562
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,405
Please. Sit down.

563
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,157
Half the city is in shock right now.

564
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,453
I went to your father's
workshop the other day.

565
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,792
And I saw everything.
I was terrified.

566
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,379
It was just suggestion.

567
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,467
My mother was followed.

568
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:17,054
She told me just before the accident.

569
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,642
Your brother told us.

570
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,814
- I should get your statement.
- I don't want to burden anyone.

571
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,026
You're not a burden.
All right, it's my job to protect you.

572
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,778
Let me go get my recorder,
and I'll be right back.

573
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,761
You okay?

574
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,067
- Thank you but I...
- It's to protect you.

575
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,864
All right. I appreciate it.

576
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,576
My Dad said you were a jerk.

577
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,038
That you always complained
when he fixed your car.

578
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,957
Sometimes I get pissed off
when people don't do their job well.

579
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,753
I'm not exactly what you
might call a nice guy. You know?

580
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,129
Yes you are.

581
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,966
To me, at least.

582
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,140
- Good night.
- Good night.

583
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,395
And hey, hey. Thank you.

584
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,808
This happened today?
What time?

585
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,894
Around three o'clock.
Between Main and Timothy.

586
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,163
And what exactly did
your mother tell you?

587
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,207
It was one of their tactics.

588
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,336
They blend in with people on the
street and start staring at someone.

589
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,046
What for?

590
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,968
- It's a death threat.
- How did she know?

591
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,388
She never said.

592
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,766
But she died right after.

593
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:13,814
Sometimes they'd call in the
middle of the night and hang up.

594
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,983
That's a warning.

595
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,443
A warning?

596
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,903
Yeah, it's like...

597
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,449
An invitation. To be one of them.

598
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,161
Shh...

599
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,593
So much depravity.
So much evil.

600
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,970
How...

601
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:36,517
How does he fool us? Just when
I thought my life was back on track,

602
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,771
my mother and I away
from temptation from the Devil.

603
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,066
That's right when I was closest to him.

604
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,443
You don't know, John?

605
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,905
- You really don't know?
- Bruce.

606
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,574
You had no idea what you were getting into?

607
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:58,247
There's no Devil, John.
There's only you. You're the Devil.

608
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,584
What about your wife?
You ready to confess to killing her?

609
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:06,422
- No... I didn't... It was an accident.
- Bull shit!

610
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,050
The threats, the anonymous phone calls.
People stalking her.

611
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,428
You didn't know anything about that.

612
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:16,348
Quit praying and drawing things
and give me names!

613
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,727
- Are you sure you can handle this?
- What are you talking about?

614
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,522
This case is affecting everyone.
And you as well.

615
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,566
No need to play the tough guy.

616
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:31,155
Half the cops on this case are dragging ass
because I put one of our own behind bars.

617
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:35,659
The other half are complete idiots
to begin with. That's what's affecting me.

618
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,245
What about the nightmares?

619
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,417
Are you going to tell me
you're the only one not having any?

620
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,169
No, no I'm having them.

621
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:48,172
Luckily we all have you
to take care of us Professor.

622
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,720
Angela.

623
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:02,478
Clear something up for me and...
these gentlemen.

624
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,609
Why did you let the Reverend
tell me what your father did.

625
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,279
Why? If you already
knew I was involved?

626
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,994
Because you don't
remember, Grandma.

627
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,416
I thought I was going crazy.

628
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,587
Because you'd walk around as if...

629
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,840
everything was normal.

630
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,887
But then I realized...

631
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,266
That's a lie!

632
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,685
Hey. Rose. Rose.

633
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,814
I want to talk to my grandson!
Talk to Roy! He knows me!

634
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,442
He knows that I would
never do such a thing.

635
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:55,531
Listen Rose, it's your own son that's
telling us, Rose. You understand that?

636
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,534
Take another look
at John's drawings

637
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,620
- and see if there's something...
- I don't kill babies!

638
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,788
I know who I am.

639
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,041
I think you and I
should go on with the therapy.

640
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,129
You just don't...
just don't remember.

641
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:16,468
- I know who I am!
- I know who I am!

642
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,181
I think I better take you home.

643
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,102
Come Rose.

644
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,397
You will pay for this!

645
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:25,662
You were right.
This case is getting to me.

646
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,292
Since we've had
absolutely no progress.

647
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,129
Nothing. This is impossible.

648
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,507
There are too many pieces here.

649
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:44,473
John blocked his memories
because they defied his morality.

650
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:50,479
And his son Roy is a defence mechanism.
All right, very well. But now Rose.

651
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,732
You're the one that said
the mind is a whole universe.

652
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,151
Oh God I say that crap sometimes.

653
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:05,077
What about from a
non-scientific standpoint?

654
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:10,082
Non-scientific.

655
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,670
What are you implying -
that we were all possessed by the Devil?

656
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,089
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind.

657
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,067
It wasn't you, Rose.

658
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,404
It was his will.

659
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,616
And he is the one we're up against.

660
01:01:55,545 --> 01:02:00,382
You can't be too careful. The men and women
who have sworn to serve Satan

661
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,885
will do anything to spread
the fear among us.

662
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,513
No one can...

663
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,476
Yeah Chief, I'm watching it.

664
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,858
Who is this?

665
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,904
Hello?

666
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,451
Hello?

667
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:31,329
...I saw them kill
all kinds of animals.

668
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,375
One time I even saw them sacrifice...

669
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,211
...a baby.

670
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:42,507
I know they took photos
and videotaped it.

671
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,270
We recall the case
in Jordan, Minnesota.

672
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,981
And the case of Paul Ingram,
in Olympia, Washington.

673
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,275
Who was accused of
being a Satanist.

674
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,779
This could mean that
Satanic activity has branched out.

675
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:07,991
Creating a network that is
terrifying as it is invisible.

676
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,286
We asked Professor Jennings,
an expert in Demonology

677
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:15,081
to explain to us, what exactly we're up
against when we talk about Satan.

678
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:19,044
Well that's the problem.
We think we live in modern times,

679
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,589
protected in our homes,
with alarms and our modern cars.

680
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,466
But it's the eternal battle.

681
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,428
The Devil will do everything
to make us forget that he exists.

682
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:32,766
It's easier to fall into his trap when you
don't suspect his existence.

683
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:37,312
Do you believe
the Devil is a real entity...

684
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,439
Lacy?

685
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,782
Lacy?

686
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,665
Lacy?

687
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,545
Lacy?

688
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:05,173
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

689
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,512
Lacy?

690
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:15,350
Kitty-kitty-kitty.
Come on kitty.

691
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,980
What's wrong with you?

692
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,566
You silly cat.
Come out of there.

693
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,110
Come on will you.

694
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,405
Come on Lacy.

695
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,406
Oh God in heaven, hallowed be thy name!
Thy kingdom come...

696
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,537
You filthy liar!

697
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:21,416
We know what you did! You killed a baby!

698
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,835
Fucking bitch!

699
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,468
You're a filthy liar!

700
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:35,931
You know what you did!
You killed a baby!

701
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:41,895
Whore! Whore!

702
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,628
Did you look at that window?

703
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,089
Looks like she was trying to get away.

704
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,132
See, what did I tell you, man.

705
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,426
The somebody pushed her.
And the house is clean.

706
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,637
You know exactly what I said.

707
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,722
What's going on, Charlie?

708
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:22,727
Boss, I never really believe
in this sort of stuff.

709
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,604
But?

710
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,941
But I'm starting to think this won't help.

711
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,612
Those people are just flesh and bone.

712
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,240
I'm not talking about people, Boss.

713
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:53,133
We're waiting for her to confess.
So right now she'll stay in the hospital.

714
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,678
- I feel like this is all my fault.
- No, God...

715
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:01,433
It's true. I've ruined their lives, Bruce.

716
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,644
- Please don't say that again.
- You don't understand.

717
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,022
I know I should hate them.

718
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,608
But they're my family.

719
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,159
I talk to her every day.

720
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,038
She left us.

721
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,332
All of us.

722
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,252
Despite everything my Dad
put her through.

723
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:37,135
You don't believe, do you?
In praying.

724
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,349
I believe in you, Angela. I do.

725
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,352
I really do.

726
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,280
You're all I've got, Bruce.

727
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:10,001
- Sorry.
- Angela, I'm sorry.

728
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:16,341
- I've never...
- Now listen.

729
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:21,763
Listen, forgive me, okay.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

730
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:30,814
What are you doing, Bruce?

731
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,400
What are you doing?

732
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,841
Roy...

733
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,136
Oh Roy.

734
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,144
Grandma, what happened?

735
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,897
They hounded me.

736
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:21,030
So I wouldn't tell,
what I did to you.

737
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,743
Grandma, you never did anything to me.

738
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,871
You were always good to
me.

739
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,165
Accepted me as I am.

740
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,877
Horrible things.

741
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,462
Horrible things...

742
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,300
I know that now.

743
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,686
Don't talk to her anymore.

744
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,646
- You're making her crazy.
- What happened?

745
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,399
- You really think she saw the Devil?
- Roy.

746
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,235
She suffered a
spontaneous regression.

747
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:02,197
Now we need to separate
the real from the imagined.

748
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,365
She started drinking again,
she's delirious.

749
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,326
- Roy.
- You're a fraud.

750
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,206
Just like him.

751
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,499
You think I don't remember?

752
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:17,003
Always preaching, sticking your nose into
other people's lives,

753
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:20,048
like you did with mine!
You and your fucking church!

754
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:23,843
I'm very sorry you feel that way, Roy.

755
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,139
Will you at least come
and see your sister?

756
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,979
I should go.

757
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:39,984
I got a better idea.
Why don't all of your just go.

758
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,737
Leave us alone.

759
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:59,170
He's only trying to protect Rose.
We have to talk to him again.

760
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,881
You don't know what
you're up against.

761
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:05,510
Don't you see it?
He's with them now.

762
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,304
And I don't think even he knows it.

763
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,474
- All of this is Satan's work.
- Oh come on.

764
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,601
I'm talking about evil.

765
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:18,606
- Evil itself.
- Evil itself? Listen, Reverend.

766
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:23,695
No. The Devil will do
the same thing to you.

767
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:28,616
As he's doing to John's family.
He'll find a way to confuse you.

768
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:30,994
To tempt you.

769
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,752
I've already handed out
quite a few at the station.

770
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,505
- You did what?
- It can't do any harm.

771
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,349
Good night.

772
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,771
- Why don't you just admit it?
- Admit what?

773
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,940
That you're scared to death.

774
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,569
You're not using your head anymore.

775
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,405
Raines...

776
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,942
And what exactly did
your mother tell you?

777
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,653
It was one of their tactics.

778
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:51,199
They blend in with people on the street
and start staring at someone.

779
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,909
What for?

780
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,829
It's a death threat.

781
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,892
Hello?

782
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,107
Hello?

783
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,819
Listen I am sick...

784
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:51,342
Sometimes they'd call
in the middle of the night and hang up.

785
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,302
That's a warning.

786
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,347
- A warning?
- Yeah, it's like...

787
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,936
an invitation to be one of them.

788
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,736
Bruce?

789
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,657
Are you all right?

790
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,957
- Where am I...
- Shh...

791
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,837
Tell them he's ready.

792
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,719
Nesbitt...

793
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,390
- This can't be real.
- Of course it's not real.

794
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,851
- You're in custody.
- It's not happening, Bruce.

795
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,228
- This is a dream.
- Come on.

796
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,524
Walk slowly.

797
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:53,821
Hold him,
he's still a bit dizzy.

798
01:14:56,533 --> 01:15:00,286
- Watch your step, Bruce.
- What are you all doing in my house?

799
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,622
- Let him through.
- Get out of my house.

800
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:04,707
Make way. Make way.

801
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,460
- Get out of my house!
- This is not your house.

802
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,182
You're dreaming, Bruce.

803
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,937
This isn't real.

804
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:34,278
Give him the knife.

805
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,187
No! No!

806
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,399
No! No!

807
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,367
Don't cry sweetheart.

808
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:26,998
It's only a dream.
Our secret recipe.

809
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,127
Go on. Drink.

810
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,839
I'm not one of you!

811
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:40,553
I'm not one of you!
I'm not one of you!

812
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,009
Come on Lady.

813
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,523
Tough luck.

814
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:45,951
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

815
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,207
Come on.

816
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,434
Morning.

817
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:27,326
What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here!

818
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,662
- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus Christ, Bruce!

819
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,997
This man is under arrest! Get off me!

820
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:35,501
Who authorized his release!
Get the fuck off me!

821
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,422
He came here to pick up his stuff.

822
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:42,508
They released him
yesterday afternoon.

823
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,552
I tried to call you
but you never answered.

824
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,806
- But why! Why did you release him?
- He passed the polygraph twice.

825
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:51,183
- Polygraph...
- We had no choice.

826
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,019
- That's the deal we had with his lawyer...
- What deal?

827
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:56,856
I know he's lying, Chief! I know it.

828
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,943
Bruce, relax. Relax okay.
He'll never work here again.

829
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,739
Look. Look.
May I? It's not just the test.

830
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,658
We got back the results
of Angela's medical report.

831
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:11,412
And the mark's superficial, it was recent,
it was probably self-inflicted.

832
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,248
- I saw... I saw...
- Oh for Christ's sake. You're not a doctor.

833
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,501
- But I saw...
- You saw wrong.

834
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:20,004
It's typical in trauma victims to want to

835
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,799
strengthen their testimony
by adding little details.

836
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,926
Do we know who signed this report?

837
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,138
- Bruce.
- No, they already be among us!

838
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,474
I don't believe any of it.

839
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:36,020
I got my hands full with these guys.
Please, don't let all this get to you.

840
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,022
- Not to you.
- What...

841
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:41,484
You said you were being
watched on the street today.

842
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:46,363
Have you seen yourself
in the mirror recently?

843
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,331
Why don't you just go home and
forget about the case for a few days.

844
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,625
Something's happening to you.

845
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:41,877
This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October the fourteenth, 1990.

846
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:45,256
- State your full name.
- John Gray.

847
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:59,728
- ...hugging or kissing me...
- So she's been avoiding you?

848
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:02,439
Yeah. And also...

849
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:06,735
John, cut the shit okay.
Take your hat off.

850
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,044
Yeah and then also...

851
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,339
John, cut the shit okay.
Take your hat...

852
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,762
Shit.

853
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,373
- She's been avoiding you?
- Yeah.

854
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,375
And then also the...

855
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:06,086
John, cut the shit okay.
Take your...

856
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:10,716
You were making a list of things
that were obvious and I cut you off.

857
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,719
What was it you were going to say?
What made you feel guilty.

858
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,974
Well I think it had to
do with my son, Roy.

859
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:24,521
He's umm...
Just saying the word makes me sick.

860
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,649
What word?

861
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,068
He's a sodomite.

862
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,195
He's a what?

863
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,113
That's why I kicked him out.

864
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,741
That means he's gay?

865
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:40,079
No... well at church we
call them sodomites.

866
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:44,959
Those are sins that people
always learn from some pervert.

867
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,545
And then when Angela
started accusing me,

868
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:55,135
I... I saw it clearly. It was me.
I was the pervert.

869
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,221
Wait a second.

870
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:03,894
Are you telling me that you're taking the
blame for sexually abusing your daughter

871
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:05,771
- because your son is gay?
- Yeah.

872
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,650
John, and you waited
to tell me that until now!

873
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,027
- Why... Why are you angry?
- Now you tell me!

874
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:14,989
- Why are you so angry?
- Oh God, John!

875
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:18,158
- I'm only trying to help you.
- Bullshit you're trying to help me!

876
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,202
- Are you playing games with me?
- No sir!

877
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,496
Hey look at me,
are you playing games!

878
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,915
No, I never lied to you. sir!

879
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:32,297
You don't think I want to put an end
to all of this? I'd do anything, Bruce.

880
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,593
Anything to pay for what I've done.

881
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:45,394
To my children.
And I don't know what else to do.

882
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,175
Move.

883
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,388
You never rest, do you?

884
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,807
I have a question.
Just need a simple yes or no answer.

885
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,518
Please just for a second
can you just listen to me...

886
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,854
Can these dogs please shut up!

887
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:57,317
Look at this, please.

888
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,487
You see this picture?

889
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:05,701
I thought I knew her, I was sure that
I knew her but it's an advertisement.

890
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:09,580
Obviously. It's been up
all over town. It's a drawing.

891
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:14,877
Right? But ever since the case began, I've
been thinking about her. I put her there.

892
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:17,504
I don't know her.
She's not even real.

893
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:22,009
What if the regressions
are the same thing.

894
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:27,014
They're not memories.
They're fantasies.

895
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,516
- They're induced fantasies.
- Induced by who?

896
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:35,022
By us. By the therapy.
By police, by the media.

897
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:39,234
We bombard them with
the same thing over and over.

898
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:42,070
And their imagination
just does the rest.

899
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:47,284
We're not freeing their memories.
This is a nightmare produced by all of us.

900
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:54,291
- Collective hysteria.
- Yeah. Yeah.

901
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:01,381
It doesn't make sense.
What about Nesbitt?

902
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,676
You know he's guilty or
are you doubting that now?

903
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:06,845
No. No. George Nesbitt
is guilty, but maybe...

904
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,805
- Maybe what?
- I don't know.

905
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:10,849
Stop clutching at straws.

906
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:14,728
I'm not clutching at straws.
I'm trying to find the truth.

907
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,980
You're demolishing my work!

908
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:19,191
- Okay, all right...
- This is science.

909
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,319
- This is science!
- I'm starting to use my head again!

910
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,864
Goodbye Professor.

911
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,712
Nesbitt, what did you do?

912
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,092
What did you do.

913
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,412
Drop that! Get over there!

914
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:59,082
Let me see your faces!
Both of you, let me see your faces!

915
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,342
You had it coming.

916
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,635
For ruining his life you bastard.

917
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:16,266
His life? They just let him go!

918
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:21,188
- What you came over here to celebrate?
- What am I supposed to do now, huh?

919
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,732
- What about my career?
- Your career...

920
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:28,028
Fine. Yeah I made some mistakes.
But I shouldn't have to pay for all this!

921
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:32,407
You got what you wanted. Two stooges for
your bull shit case! You'll get a medal!

922
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:34,993
All right, listen to me right now.

923
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,829
I'm not going to report this.

924
01:29:37,997 --> 01:29:41,917
This stays between us.
Just tell me what you know, Nesbitt!

925
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,086
- Tell you what?
- What you kept from us.

926
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:46,254
What only you know about it.

927
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:52,302
Only me?

928
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,139
I told you that day in the car.

929
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,142
Am I right?

930
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:24,876
I need to speak with Angela.

931
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,756
- What happened?
- I've solved the case.

932
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,135
We've got them all.

933
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:35,554
I'll get her.

934
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,480
Hello, Angela.

935
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:49,025
Did you really?

936
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,779
Nesbitt gave us all the names.

937
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:57,200
Yeah I know, I know.
I know. Sit down. Sit down.

938
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,119
You'll be fine.

939
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:06,126
Angela. I know something
terrible happened to you.

940
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:11,756
And I understand why maybe you
didn't want to tell me this until now.

941
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,054
Nesbitt said they got you pregnant.

942
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:25,562
Did they want you to have
a baby for the sect?

943
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:31,401
Angela. Don't hold
anything back. Tell us everything.

944
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:38,116
He also told us...

945
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:43,288
...that there was a ceremony
where they gave you an abortion.

946
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,800
Please tell me they didn't...

947
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,596
Put a foetus...

948
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:16,738
Angela.

949
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,001
What is the meaning of this?

950
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,795
What's the meaning of it?

951
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:37,050
It means I made it all up.

952
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,555
- Why are you lying?
- Angela.

953
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:46,184
You have been playing us
from the start, all right. Was it you?

954
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:48,937
- You were the one calling my house?
- I didn't call anyone.

955
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,897
You were calling my house.

956
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,275
You know what
Nesbitt really told me?

957
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:57,571
He told me that you hate your family.

958
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,407
That you think they're all
a bunch of drunk losers.

959
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,452
And that your mother killed herself
because she couldn't take it anymore.

960
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,246
That's a lie.

961
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,083
You really opened up to George. And then
you guys were sleeping together, right.

962
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,169
I mean, when he told you
he would never run away with a minor...

963
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:16,881
And you saw that your life was going to be
like your mothers, you wanted to change it.

964
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:19,342
Why were you crying
that day at the seminar?

965
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:22,387
I already told you why,
her father raped her.

966
01:33:24,181 --> 01:33:26,099
No. Can I talk to you for a second.

967
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:30,395
- What are you doing?
- Just come, speak with me for one second.

968
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:34,566
Next time you hear
the voice of God, don't call us.

969
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,610
Are you out of your mind!

970
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,696
Open this door right now! Mr. Kenner!

971
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,384
You just told us
what we wanted to hear

972
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:44,534
while getting rid of your family.
Isn't that right Angela?

973
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:48,747
Then you went too far,
and now you can't stop. Isn't that right?

974
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:57,047
Who's going to believe you, Bruce?

975
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:02,385
Especially when I tell everyone
what you did in the cemetery.

976
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:05,305
In front of my mother's grave.

977
01:34:12,104 --> 01:34:15,023
You just offended someone
who loved you very much.

978
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,443
I offended you?

979
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,529
You think I care?

980
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:24,199
I was talking about your mother.

981
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,460
Get out of my church.

982
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,631
You were right, Reverend.

983
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:41,591
Get out!

984
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,719
It does exist. Evil itself.

985
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:55,021
Now the police have no leads. Which is very
common in cases of Satanic Ritual abuse.

986
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:58,525
But that begs the question,
where's the proof?

987
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,362
The Devil knows where the proof is.

988
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,282
He's the one guiding and
helping his henchmen conceal it.

989
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:10,120
To make us believe
that he doesn't exist.

990
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:15,792
I saw what they did! They killed
babies and sometimes they ate them.

991
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:19,504
Then they'd burn the remains
and bury them on my Dad's property.

992
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:21,589
They said they would kill me.

993
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:25,927
I chose to speak out about this
so the people would know the truth.

994
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,763
This is so much bigger
than what it seems.

995
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:33,643
I only hope that people realize
the enormous danger we're in.

996
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:39,357
People need to believe us.
Believe us.

997
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:45,822
That's the scariest part.
We believed it.

998
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:52,537
Hey, you did good.

999
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:00,211
Let's go.

1000
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,039
Angela must've read it.

1001
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:40,627
Or else she saw one of those shows
she's doing interviews on now.

1002
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,545
Doesn't matter, it's all trash.

1003
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:46,800
The rest is just outbreaks of panic
like the one we had here.

1004
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:49,594
The FBI had already filed all this.

1005
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:56,684
But... I don't get it. What about my
visions, and my mothers and Roy's?

1006
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:58,394
They all match,
how is that possible?

1007
01:36:58,562 --> 01:37:01,147
You saw what we made you believe,
and we believed what you saw.

1008
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:06,861
We just went around in a circle. The
tortures, the photographs, the sacrifices.

1009
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,572
We all just made it up.

1010
01:37:13,744 --> 01:37:16,955
I spoke with the D.A.
All right, now listen.

1011
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:20,542
Nobody wants to take
the blame for this mess, okay.

1012
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:23,127
They're going to want you
to confess to child molestation,

1013
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:25,839
but you can't do it
because they don't have a case.

1014
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:30,468
The only one who should
be worried right now is Angela.

1015
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:34,013
No you just...
Leave Angela alone.

1016
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:38,852
Please leave her alone.
First you said I was the Devil. Remember?

1017
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:56,828
All those years, drinkin'
and destroying myself

1018
01:37:57,913 --> 01:38:03,167
and not taking care
of my family until Emily...

1019
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:06,588
John. You have to stop punishing yourself.

1020
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:09,424
Emily gave up.
My wife gave up.

1021
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:15,305
And Angela never complained.
She never said anything.

1022
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,974
All this hate now.

1023
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:21,936
It's my fault.

1024
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:29,152
- I'm the one that made her into this.
- I am the one who failed you.

1025
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:35,074
Don't you see? From the beginning,
I couldn't see what was happening.

1026
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,578
I thought that this case...

1027
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,540
That I was the only one...

1028
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,586
I was so stupid, John.

1029
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:52,508
Please. Please, you have to at least
let me help you get out of here.

1030
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:01,392
- You really want to help me?
- Yes.

1031
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:05,897
Then you tell the D.A.
that I plead guilty.

1032
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:08,858
No. John, you'll get
a minimum of five years.

1033
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:14,447
I don't care, doesn't matter. As long as
you leave Angela alone. Don't go after her.

1034
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:21,204
She'll realize I'm doing this for her,
to protect her.

1035
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,706
And that way, maybe...

1036
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:28,336
Maybe one day she'll hate me less.

1037
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:33,132
And that's all I want, see?
