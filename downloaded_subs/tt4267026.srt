1
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,418
(car doors shutting)

2
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:24,392
(foot steps and traffic passing)

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,102
[Diane] In your opinion,

4
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,438
What happened that night
at the Abaddon Hotel?

5
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,376
I don't know.

6
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,477
You want to know what I
think happened that night?

7
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,146
I have no idea.

8
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,583
(struggling with door)

9
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,233
[Voiceover] Breaking
news, just reaching us now.

10
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,469
Tragedy at a Halloween
haunted house in Abaddon.

11
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,105
To this day, I can't give
you an answer to that question.

12
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,441
Well, Hell House was a
real tragedy on many levels.

13
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,608
[Voiceover] From
what we're hearing,

14
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,410
the opening night of
this haunted house tour,

15
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,611
ended in disaster.

16
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,547
Multiple deaths, but
police aren't answering

17
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,714
any of our questions.

18
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,284
You had older victims
and younger victims,

19
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,720
these are people who are
paying for the scare experience

20
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,590
in a controlled
environments, but in the end,

21
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,225
what they got was total chaos.

22
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,394
A small abandoned
hotel was transformed

23
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,229
into a haunted attraction.

24
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,464
It was due to run tours

25
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,466
the next few weeks
through Halloween.

26
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:43,437
(eerie piano music)

27
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:50,211
(ambulance sirens)

28
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,712
[Voiceover] We're not sure
if anybody from the company

29
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,682
has made it out alive
as of right now.

30
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,185
Shaking tour-goes appear
to not really know

31
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,752
what was going on either.

32
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,754
I been waiting on line
for about 5 minutes now,

33
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,756
and I just see all these
bunch of people coming out.

34
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,625
I'm like, "Dude, where do I go?"

35
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,793
No, we had no idea.

36
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,395
We still don't know.

37
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:14,402
(footsteps and eerie music)

38
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:27,281
(door creaking)

39
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:33,321
(rolling thunder)

40
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,224
Whenever people ask me
what happened in Hell House,

41
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,960
I tell them, "You watch
the video, you tell me."

42
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:45,199
(people talking and traffic)

43
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,338
How many people are
they letting in at a time?

44
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,273
(crowds talking)

45
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,408
It's a long wait.

46
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,280
I think we're next.

47
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,648
It's exciting.

48
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,783
We've been waiting for you.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,288
I hope you all enjoy your stay.

50
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:12,326
(eerie music and crowds talking)

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,435
(screaming)

52
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,279
Was that supposed to happen?

53
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,315
[Voiceover] I don't think so.

54
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,518
Technical difficulties
on opening night.

55
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:17,291
(eerie music and screaming)

56
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:28,402
(yelling)

57
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:02,403
(panicked screaming)

58
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:30,364
(crashing and banging)

59
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,403
[Voiceover] We gotta go,
we gotta go, we gotta go!

60
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:40,441
(crowds screaming and running)

61
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,580
[Voiceover] Hurry up!

62
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:47,781
[Voiceover] Get out of here!

63
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,418
Go, go!

64
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:57,458
(screaming and sirens)

65
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,168
[Voiceover] Oh my God!

66
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:13,073
(screaming)

67
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:31,459
(sirens)

68
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,170
Nobody knew what to
make of the YouTube video,

69
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,606
and then the 911 tape leaked and

70
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,477
that just confused
people even more.

71
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,713
[Voiceover] 911,
what's your emergency?

72
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,218
What's the problem, Miss?

73
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,654
[Voiceover] I don't know!

74
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:01,221
There's something...

75
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,423
(static)

76
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,526
[Voiceover] Is someone hurt?

77
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,860
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

78
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,962
[Voiceover] Please
hurry, I don't want to die.

79
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,931
[Voiceover] The
cause of death is now

80
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,001
vaguely being blamed on
a severe malfunction.

81
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,936
What exactly
malfunctioned isn't clear,

82
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,971
and authorities aren't saying.

83
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,840
All we have from that night is

84
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,677
the video the tour-goer
shot uploaded to YouTube

85
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,546
before the police
got ahold of it.

86
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,716
The 911 call was
the only other thing

87
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,551
and, that didn't
really tell us much

88
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,753
of what was going on inside.

89
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,589
Then this photographer,
Martin Cliver comes along,

90
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,925
gets inside the hotel,

91
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,126
takes pictures,

92
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,228
puts it up on the internet.

93
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,130
It starts to raise
some real questions

94
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,833
that the town does
now want answers to.

95
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,267
The hardest part?

96
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,504
The hardest part was
probably the silence.

97
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,973
Everything was very hush hush.

98
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,274
There were gag orders put on

99
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,977
everyone involved with the case.

100
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,648
Cops, lawyers, even the
families of the victims

101
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,883
were left pretty much
completely in the dark.

102
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:07,087
It was impossible to get
anyone to talk to us at first.

103
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,223
So, I wanted to see inside of
the hotel, first and foremost.

104
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,927
Asking questions was, like
I said, getting me nowhere.

105
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,763
So...

106
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,731
I went to the hotel

107
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,266
and I walked around the back

108
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,201
and found a little window

109
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,570
and knocked out the boards

110
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,937
and climbed inside.

111
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:28,676
(soft eerie piano music)

112
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,112
[Diane] The
blood on the floor,

113
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,747
what do you make of that?

114
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,982
Well, it certainly
debunks the theory

115
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,316
that there was some
sort of a gas leak,

116
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,554
which we all knew was
bullshit in the first place.

117
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:45,258
(eerie music)

118
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,637
(screaming)

119
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,272
(eerie music)

120
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:03,310
So, I eventually found my
way to the basement door.

121
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,879
It was blown off it's hinges,

122
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,182
like someone had forced
their way through it

123
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,152
and, I'm not gonna lie,

124
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,955
I stood to the side of the door,

125
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,657
and pointed the camera
down the stairs,

126
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,192
and just snapped a few pictures.

127
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,896
(soft violin music)

128
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,765
I've seen a lot.

129
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,700
I've been to a lot of
scary places in my carrer,

130
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:31,739
and there was no way I was
going down those stairs.

131
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,674
No way.

132
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:37,978
(soft violin music)

133
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:42,950
(eerie soft music)

134
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,941
[Diane] Would you please

135
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,978
state your name and
age for the camera?

136
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,147
[Sara] I'm Sara
Havel, I'm 30 years old.

137
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,716
[Diane] And you were a member

138
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,852
of Hell House since it's
beginning in 2002, correct?

139
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,220
Yeah.

140
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,291
[Diane] And, since the
night of the tragedy,

141
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,294
where have you been, Sara?

142
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,697
I've been staying
with family, mostly.

143
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,332
[Diane] Have you
been coping okay?

144
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,068
I'm in a better place now.

145
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,337
[Diane] I'm
happy to hear that.

146
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,373
If you don't mind, I just
want to jump right into it

147
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:45,278
because obviously the
town's decision to conceal

148
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,881
all aspects of this
tragedy from the public

149
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:51,785
have caused conspiracy theorists
and normal people alike

150
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,221
to speculate on their own.

151
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,289
It was the smart thing to do.

152
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,524
[Diane] Why?

153
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:02,062
If people knew what really
went on inside of that house,

154
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,833
it would've been hard
for them to deal with.

155
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,706
[Diane] Well, I guess...

156
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,908
I guess that's what
we're all wondering,

157
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,044
what really happened...

158
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,146
Can you help?

159
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,114
What do you want to know?

160
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,482
[Diane] Well, can you take us

161
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,419
back to the beginning
and go from there?

162
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,426
What is that?

163
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,796
It's everything.

164
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,331
Everything that went on
in the house was taped.

165
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:43,270
Mostly by Paul and
Tony, some tour-goers.

166
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,939
[Diane] How did you get
these and not the police?

167
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,440
I got to them first.

168
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,043
[Diane] Why didn't you
give them to the police?

169
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,812
You'll see.

170
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,080
[Diane] Mitchell?

171
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,148
Mitchell's gonna
go 'head and just

172
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,918
start looking through
those, if that's alright?

173
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:02,089
(footsteps and door closing)

174
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,761
Sara, have you watched those?

175
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,329
No.

176
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,265
[Diane] So you have
no idea what's on them?

177
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,870
Hell House.

178
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:28,982
[Paul] C'mon,

179
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:30,884
it's a recent film,
you can get this.

180
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,087
Post apocalyptic,
set in New York.

181
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,756
[Paul] You can get this.

182
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,092
That's good.

183
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:41,361
[Paul] C'mon, it came
out literally a year ago.

184
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,130
I can't...

185
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,064
I'm drawing a blank.

186
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,532
Last clue.

187
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,568
[Paul] (sign)
Alright, Will Smith.

188
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,204
No, Hitch was not...

189
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,305
I love Hitch.

190
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,240
[Paul] Shocker.

191
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,407
It's funny.

192
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,376
It is and I stand behind it.

193
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,144
Paul.

194
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,045
Don't knock it.

195
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:58,812
It's a good movie.

196
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,447
(laughing)

197
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,915
Is it...

198
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,117
Okay, is it...

199
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,187
Escape From New York.

200
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,890
For those watching,

201
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,927
Sara's asking if it's a
1981 Kurt Russel joint.

202
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,897
So then, it's not.

203
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,398
[Paul] No, not
even close, c'mon.

204
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,366
So, have we all
just sort of given up

205
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,534
on navigating guys,
am I doing all of it?

206
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,103
[Paul] Jesus Christ.

207
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,905
I think that Alex has it
under control, right buddy?

208
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,573
I do have it under control.

209
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,341
Thank you, Paul.

210
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,977
Yes, it's straight up ahead.

211
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,978
I recognize the road.

212
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,279
You're not lost.

213
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,982
We're almost there, alright?

214
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,284
And in today's edition of.

215
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,453
Why Are Mac and
Alex Sill Fighting,

216
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,091
Mac and Alex are still fighting.

217
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,861
[Paul] They're really mad.

218
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,331
It gets so passionate.

219
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,834
[Paul] Is that what
he's like in the sack.

220
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,639
Guys, I'm really hungry.

221
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,141
I'm starving.

222
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,976
Do you want to
pee or anything.

223
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,645
Yeah, can we pee out
there in the grass, please?

224
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,613
I mean do you...

225
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,847
Tell me, tell me this,

226
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,616
alright, if you're going to
a haunted house for Halloween

227
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,618
and this is the drive over,

228
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,486
tell me this isn't creepier
than New York City.

229
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,055
Look, look, look,
look, look, look,

230
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,323
there it is, there
it is, there it is.

231
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,158
[Paul] Is that really it?

232
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,459
[Alex] This is it.

233
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,627
[Paul] What a shit hole.

234
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,229
I love it.

235
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,164
Are you kidding me.

236
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:24,998
I got it.

237
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,241
This is good.

238
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,143
Yeah, let's stop here.

239
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,382
Seven years of bad
luck for breaking that.

240
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,251
Oh this is good, Paul,
are you getting this?

241
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,419
You can work out on that one.

242
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,620
[Voiceover] We'll set you up,

243
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,388
and we'll have a tour
guide come through.

244
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,023
(laughing)

245
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,037
(door creaking)

246
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,605
Here we go.

247
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,445
(laughing)

248
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:16,049
Hell House 2009.

249
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,487
When you said abandoned
I thought you meant

250
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,623
recently foreclosed,
not condemned.

251
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,025
[Alex] I don't even know how

252
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,493
you'd run power to
a place like this...

253
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,095
[Mac] So, if we're
gonna get power,

254
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,662
it's gonna be because of you.

255
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,664
(Alex and Mac fighting
in background)

256
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,466
And that's a sign.

257
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,037
[Paul] Look at
this old ass book.

258
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,606
Oh, did you hear the pages?

259
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,277
You know, I need electricity

260
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,379
to do everything
that I do here, bud.

261
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,514
Well, part of what you do is

262
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,682
get the electricity
running, so...

263
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,351
That's all you, Tony.

264
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,320
Stop giving me that look.

265
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,188
[Paul] This is
pretty creepy, man.

266
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,290
It smells like a sweater.

267
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,126
[Paul] A sweater?

268
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,361
An old sweater.

269
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,464
(laughing)

270
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,733
Oh, the foyer.

271
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,469
[Paul] Dude, what is
the deal with this place.

272
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,771
[Sara] When did Fletcher
say the guy closes?

273
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,605
I don't know.

274
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,374
It has history, alright?

275
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,342
It's not that important.

276
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,176
Maybe this is a bad idea.

277
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,544
It's not a bad idea.

278
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,212
Okay, look at all this
free production, alright?

279
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,213
And, you smell that?

280
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,448
Yeah.

281
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,050
Hun, what did it
smell like to you?

282
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:23,783
I think it's probably dead
rodents in the baseboards.

283
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,185
[Sara] It smells like...

284
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,019
[Paul] It smells
like money, bro.

285
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,187
Thank you, Paul.

286
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,355
Why is it that it's
Paul always on my side.

287
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,389
[Mac] We're not
gonna have time.

288
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,392
[Alex] I have no doubt we can

289
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,527
get this up and
running by Halloween.

290
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,463
Alright, well,
let's get to it.

291
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,231
Can we see some happy faces?

292
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,134
Paul, you ever see
a smile on my face?

293
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,171
Now, show Mac and see the
complete utter difference.

294
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,638
We're gonna do a time lapse.

295
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,773
[Paul] Wah-wah.

296
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,676
Dude, dibs on manning
the haunted bar.

297
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,643
[Alex] Yeah?

298
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,645
I'm sure house would love that.

299
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,147
[Paul] What do we got in here?

300
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,648
Anything good?

301
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,585
Nothing that matters.

302
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,387
(coughing)

303
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,388
Yeah, not good.

304
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,355
[Paul] A little ripe, huh?

305
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,193
I fuckin' love this place.

306
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,527
Yeah?

307
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,463
What's your wine of
choice, hot shot.

308
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,432
[Paul] I'm kind of a
pinot grig man myself.

309
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,733
A pinot grig man?

310
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,435
I'm sure they taste
like ass after

311
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,538
however many summers
they've spent cooking.

312
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:23,076
[Paul] Dude, wine tastes
better with age, you know that.

313
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,512
Yeah, not with heat, though.

314
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,548
[Paul] You're so smart, Tony.

315
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,151
[Tony] God damn,

316
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,520
this must be where the
last supper took place.

317
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,621
(laughing)

318
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,822
[Alex] What's up guys.

319
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,225
Welcome to the dining
room, I'm guessing.

320
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,361
[Tony] If that's what
you want to call it, sure.

321
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,163
What do you got there?

322
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,233
Oh, it kinda looks
like Sara, huh?

323
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,101
[Paul] No, the plate's cuter.

324
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,169
No.

325
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,303
What do you think, babe.

326
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,605
Look at that.

327
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,143
Might be her grandmother.

328
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,812
Well, it's a fixer
upper for sure,

329
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,782
but it's what we do best, right?

330
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,517
I say we stay here the night.

331
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,353
That's just me, but...

332
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,754
Uh, I don't know.

333
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,291
There's no fucking way we
are staying here tonight.

334
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,328
[Tony] I wonder if they
used this place for anything.

335
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:17,697
[Paul] I don't know, bro.

336
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,502
Look at this.

337
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,503
Weird.

338
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,737
[Paul] Creepy.

339
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,641
(radio static)

340
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,218
What the fuck was that?

341
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,453
I don't know.

342
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,693
[Voiceover] Tony, Paul,

343
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,261
get your asses down
to the basement.

344
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,562
(laughing)

345
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:53,266
On our way.

346
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,434
Just, turn the camera off.

347
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,369
You're gonna break your
neck on the stairs.

348
00:18:56,403 --> 00:19:01,408
(creaking and footsteps)

349
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,357
Check it out.

350
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,559
More numbers.

351
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,393
It's weird.

352
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,394
(footsteps on stairs)

353
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,730
Watch your step there, Fellini.

354
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,898
Oh, shit!

355
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,301
This place is amazing.

356
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,470
[Paul] What the
fuck happened here?

357
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,540
Paul, I want you to
get this on camera.

358
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,408
So, the tour guides
are gonna come in

359
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,609
right there down these stairs,

360
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,444
right where you two
just came out of.

361
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,411
[Paul] Alright.

362
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,379
Then they come through,

363
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,680
our girl's gonna be
chained up right here,

364
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,449
she's gonna be
screaming like crazy.

365
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,284
Alright, she might actually

366
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,518
even be topless
for you, brother.

367
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,686
No, I'm kidding, that's
not gonna happen.

368
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,620
[Paul] No, you promise.

369
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,455
Then we're gonna have clowns

370
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,289
right behind this wall,

371
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,957
one, two, three, four...

372
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,659
However many clowns we can fit.

373
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,693
Hopefully they'll be moving,

374
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:54,927
we'll see what happens.

375
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,729
There's a storm door
right at the end

376
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,698
of this creepy hallway,

377
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,932
and that's where they exit.

378
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:00,867
In and out.

379
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,236
We've handled much much worse.

380
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,970
Remember Queens?

381
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:04,704
Yeah.

382
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,306
Hey, hey, hey,

383
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,840
I thought we were never
to speak of Queens again.

384
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:08,575
[Alex] Tony...

385
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:09,742
Your words.

386
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,344
I need you to
worry about these.

387
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,745
Okay?

388
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,580
These walkie-talkies are
getting this funky noise.

389
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:14,447
I don't know what it is.

390
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,382
[Tony] I know, I know.

391
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,583
We were getting it upstairs too.

392
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:20,387
[Paul] Dudes, what
are all these books?

393
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,722
[Sara] This one's a bible.

394
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:23,990
[Paul] That's a nice touch.

395
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,558
[Alex] That's
definitely a bible.

396
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,430
That's so fucked up.

397
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,400
Guys, this is kind
of unsettling, right?

398
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:33,966
[Alex] C'mon, c'mon.

399
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,302
It's a hotel.

400
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,803
Okay, there's bibles
in every room.

401
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,638
Yeah, but who
put them down here.

402
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,806
I mean, look at that wall.

403
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,475
It's fucking creepy.

404
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,743
[Paul] Didn't Fletcher say

405
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,911
this place has been
closed for 30 years?

406
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,313
[Sara] Okay,
why was it closed?

407
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,013
[Alex] Guys,
their pipes burst.

408
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,014
There was a lawsuit.

409
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,482
We're building a haunted house.

410
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:52,285
This is half the work
already done for us.

411
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:52,952
I don't know what you guys are

412
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,953
freaking out about.

413
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,289
That wall is perfect.

414
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,358
[Paul] Well, we could
look on the bright side.

415
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,594
We get free props out of it.

416
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,633
What size are you?

417
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,035
[Diane] Tell me
what it was like

418
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,071
to live in an abandoned hotel.

419
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,408
It took Tony and
Paul about a week

420
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,544
to get the electricity going and

421
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,912
that's when we started
staying over night.

422
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,915
It was when we
started sleeping there

423
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,553
that things started to change.

424
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,588
[Diane] Change how?

425
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,827
(laughing and talking)

426
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,030
[Paul] Let's see what the
rest of our crew is up to.

427
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,632
It was so hot.

428
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,601
They were all dressed like
Disney princesses, okay.

429
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,969
Oh, look who's here!

430
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:43,936
Do you remember when all those

431
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,438
Disney princesses came through?

432
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,673
[Paul] Oh, yeah, there we go.

433
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,342
And you were like, a
werewolf or something.

434
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,944
[Paul] Oh, the Disney
princesses, yeah.

435
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,112
Shh, shh!

436
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,448
Jasmine was so hot.

437
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,849
So, they all come through and

438
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,451
me and Mac were back there and

439
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,686
we're like, "Oh, this is it."

440
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,020
Dude, me and Tony
were in another room

441
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,389
doing other things.

442
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:03,956
He was a werewolf,
what were you that year?

443
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,857
(howling)

444
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,459
Someone was...

445
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,427
I think I was like the
puss slayer, or somethin'.

446
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,928
They passed Tony.

447
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,096
[Paul] Dude what?

448
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:10,963
That's the last thing
you've ever been.

449
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:11,698
(laughing)

450
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:12,665
C'mon man.

451
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:13,966
That's usually what I am,

452
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,101
most days out of the week.

453
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,970
The moral of the story is,

454
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,106
we tried too hard to
scare these girls,

455
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,908
because we thought
they'd be an easy scare,

456
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,109
and what did they do?

457
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,544
They laughed their
fucking asses off.

458
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,513
[Paul] Princesses, man.

459
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:27,747
The fucking princesses.

460
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,715
[Paul] Yeah.

461
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,649
Is that the whole story?

462
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,386
Well, that's the
whole story on my end.

463
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,587
[Paul] Yeah.

464
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,122
Queens was actually
pretty fuckin' sick,

465
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,323
if you think about it.

466
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,492
We actually had some good
motherfuckin' times at Queens.

467
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,762
That guy who played
Lucifer was that guy

468
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,731
from like Queens he had
a really thick New York...

469
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,066
He'd be like, "Yeah,
welcome to Lucifer's cabin."

470
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:52,071
(laughing)

471
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:01,047
[Paul] We got so many
bad reviews on that guy.

472
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,214
Dude, I had to fire that guy.

473
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,484
He almost kicked my fucking ass.
[Paul] He was terrible.

474
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,752
We keep in touch.

475
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:06,686
Fuck you!

476
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,788
I keep in touch with that guy.

477
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:09,822
That guy was an asshole.

478
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:10,990
He's decent.

479
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:11,991
You buy drugs
from him, don't you.

480
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,627
Keep the camera running,
I want to say something.

481
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,796
Oh my god.

482
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,500
[Paul] Speech time.

483
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,001
I know it was hasty,

484
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,636
moving up out of the city,

485
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,938
coming up to this po'dunk town.

486
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:26,806
You're all creeped out.

487
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,974
You're all nervous.

488
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,643
But we gotta keep Hell
House fresh, okay.

489
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,745
That's why we're here.

490
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,080
[Paul] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

491
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,047
It's gonna work out.

492
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,182
I know it's gonna work out.

493
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,584
Well, do you think we'll still

494
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,918
get the numbers we
did in New York.

495
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,553
Easily.

496
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,655
I mean, c'mon, word of
mouth after opening night.

497
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:43,590
Plus, what are we?

498
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:44,824
Like 40 minutes from the city.

499
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,493
And you've seen Abaddon.

500
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,661
This town really
appreciates Halloween.

501
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,530
We're gonna get that
beautiful Fall feeling.

502
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,798
You just can't get
that in a city.

503
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,732
Yeah, well, in
the city at least

504
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,467
when you're creeped out
you can walk outside

505
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,470
and fuckin' get
a slice of pizza.

506
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,205
Here it's like,
you're creeped out

507
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,607
you walk outside - [Paul] You
can't beat New York pizza.

508
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,974
And you're in
a fucking forest.

509
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,576
Man, say whatever
the fuck you want

510
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,945
about Queens haunts, we
never had to sleep there.

511
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,814
[Sara] That is a good point.

512
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:08,781
Alright.

513
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,850
I'm trying to get you
motivated, alright.

514
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,219
Thank you, honey.

515
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,987
[Paul] I appreciate it, buddy.

516
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,590
You can turn the
camera off now.

517
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,493
(static)

518
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,563
[Paul] Where is it?

519
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,599
Shebang, baby!

520
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,534
Good job, Tony!

521
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,234
Up and running.

522
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,836
Thank you, sir.

523
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:30,837
Tony, I thought I said I
didn't want any blind spots.

524
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,838
What's going on here?

525
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:32,939
What room is this?

526
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,674
Uh, yeah, that's the basement.

527
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,108
It's got some thick stone walls,

528
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,746
but, we should be able to
get camera through there,

529
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,647
or at least walkies,

530
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,581
but we're not.

531
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:42,549
We're not getting anything.

532
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,683
So.

533
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:44,684
It's a liability.

534
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:45,985
We've gotta have
eyes down there.

535
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,086
Yes, thank you, Mac.

536
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,588
You have a half naked girl

537
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:49,789
in a room full of assholes.

538
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,890
Of course we need
eyes down there.

539
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,258
How 'bout we, you know,

540
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,526
get some big guy,

541
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,861
muscles, totally ripped,

542
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,863
put him in the clown costume.

543
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,264
[Paul] Undercover clown, sick.

544
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,766
Yeah, I mean.

545
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,068
We're gonna need an
actor down there anyway.

546
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,736
So, why not someone
that can toss out

547
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,171
people like Paul who wanna get

548
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:08,240
a little rapey with our actor.

549
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,275
[Paul] He's got a point.

550
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,843
Sure, sure.

551
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:11,911
Alright, Tony.

552
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:12,912
[Paul] Good idea, dude.

553
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:13,913
Way to go.

554
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,782
All that work, done.

555
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,584
[Paul] What's
going on here, man?

556
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,218
It looks like shit.

557
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,987
Yeah, well, Alex
didn't want to

558
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,922
spend any money on
moving props here,

559
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,025
so we're stuck with
this one right here.

560
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,326
Good thing that we're geniuses,

561
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,728
so, when we're done with her,

562
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,663
she'll be creepy as shit.

563
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,665
(drilling)

564
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,233
[Paul] How's it
hangin', sweetheart?

565
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,769
Just, put the
camera down for a sec

566
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:37,804
and help me out.

567
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,739
[Paul] No can do, hombre.

568
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,842
Boy genius wants all
this shit documented.

569
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,844
That's a pretty
lame excuse for you

570
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,046
to be a lazy piece of
shit like you always are.

571
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,949
(laughing)

572
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,285
Ladies and gentlemen,

573
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,321
this is my buddy, Hector.

574
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:58,891
Me and Hector are gonna
play a little song for you.

575
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,293
Are you ready, Hector?

576
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:06,298
(eerie piano music)

577
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:18,044
Hector, it's okay.

578
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,012
Two, three, four.

579
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,314
(coughing)

580
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,085
Hello everybody.

581
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:30,189
It's September 5th, 2009.

582
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,794
We're tres weeks
into the creation

583
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,930
of this year's Hell House.

584
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:40,132
It's lonely.

585
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,902
Sara's the only
chick in the house,

586
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,171
and Alex don't like sharing,

587
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,874
if you know what I mean.

588
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:53,179
I had really high hopes
for this trip, you know.

589
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,947
Really high.

590
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,082
I thought that it was gonna be

591
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,218
more like Grand Sexual Station.

592
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,120
It's cool though.

593
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:04,123
We got the new actors
coming tomorrow.

594
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,026
So, hopefully one
of them's boneable.

595
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,163
I will be documenting the
whole thing, as always.

596
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,733
The whole shebang...

597
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,302
Sara?

598
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,173
What's up, dude?

599
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,745
You cool?

600
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,318
What, are you sleepwalking?

601
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,858
That's fucking weird.

602
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,994
That's it for me.

603
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,462
See you in the morning.

604
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,064
Sleep sweet.

605
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:49,936
(creaking and talking)

606
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,316
I'm more in line for
this joke than you are.

607
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,485
I feel like I'm writing it
and you're responding to it.

608
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,955
And then she says,
"Do you have any syrup?"

609
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,223
You say, "No."

610
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,192
Oh my god!

611
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,794
Get the fuck out of here, dude.

612
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:15,795
Get the fuck outta here.

613
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:16,829
That's not cool, man.

614
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,030
[Paul] C'mon, guys.

615
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,866
You were the one with
your door cracked open.

616
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:20,867
You wanted me to see.

617
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,034
You're not supposed to
even be here right now.

618
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:22,869
Get the fuck out of here.

619
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,270
Can you stop, seriously?

620
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,471
[Paul] Hey, motherfucker,

621
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:28,707
I came up here to help you out.

622
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:30,943
Not that!

623
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,112
I had to tell you that
the actors are here.

624
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,314
The actors are here?

625
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,282
Whose here?

626
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,984
[Paul] Joey, Melissa, Sam.

627
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:40,219
Joey, Melissa, Sam.

628
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,988
Joey's clown, Melissa's...

629
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,422
Okay, Joey, Melissa, Sam.

630
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,156
Get that...

631
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,260
(raining)

632
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,100
That's Paul.

633
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,234
Paul's gonna be filming.

634
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,135
Say hello to Paul,
everybody wave to Paul.

635
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,303
Hi, Paul.

636
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:02,274
(raining)

637
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,552
I actually found
one police officer

638
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,855
who was willing to speak to me,

639
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:20,159
under the condition of
complete anonymity, of course.

640
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:23,295
He was one of the
first responders

641
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:27,266
to the hotel the night of
the Hell House incident.

642
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,170
And was one of the
first people inside.

643
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,372
So, he said the first
body they came across

644
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,574
was one of the
Hell House members.

645
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,310
He couldn't say which one.

646
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:41,948
But he said their
throat had been cut

647
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:45,784
and that he was pretty sure

648
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,189
that the wound was
self inflicted.

649
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:55,194
(soft instrumental music)

650
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,465
What the hell happened in there?

651
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,034
And your guess is
as good as mine.

652
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:05,037
And I honestly don't
think we'll ever know.

653
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:07,239
And then, of course,

654
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:11,443
there's the very strange, very
sad case of Joey Sheifler,

655
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,981
who was in the basement
at the time of the chaos

656
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,983
and actually made it out alive.

657
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:21,287
Of course, we all
know how that ended.

658
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,325
(eerie music)

659
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:49,281
(raining)

660
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:02,361
(talking)

661
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,529
Hey Paul!

662
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:04,496
[Paul] Hey baby,
how you doin' girl?

663
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,998
Getting a little nervous,

664
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,233
so if you wouldn't mind.

665
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,067
[Paul] What are
you nervous about?

666
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,935
Taking your top off?

667
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,136
Oh my god, no.

668
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,071
Thanks for a lot of help, Paul.
[Paul] Oh, you're so cute.

669
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,373
No, you are not taking
your top off, my god!

670
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,542
You are however very important.

671
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,210
Okay, you're our
main attraction.

672
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:19,311
You're at the end of the tour,

673
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,246
you're in the basement.

674
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,981
You're our damsel in distress.

675
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,350
Right no one's gonna be
touching me or anything?

676
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,517
No.

677
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,053
No one's gonna get
near you, okay?

678
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,254
You met Joey the
other day, right?

679
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,488
Joey's gonna be in one
of the clown suits,

680
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,157
and he'll be down their
with you all night.

681
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,393
Can I ask why you're
filming everything?

682
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,328
Yeah, I'm sorry.

683
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:37,529
A lot of this is just for us.

684
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,332
It helps us next year
with our next haunt.

685
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,001
But, you know,
it's good for fans.

686
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,402
Maybe something for the website.

687
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,004
[Paul] Plus I'm
trying to catch a ghost.

688
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:47,373
So you have heard the
rumors about this place.

689
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,607
- There are no rumors about this place.
- [Paul] What rumors?

690
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,676
No, rumors, we
talked about this.

691
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:51,543
Just, shut down.

692
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,411
That's all Mary says.

693
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,412
It's just shut down.

694
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:54,680
[Paul] What do you know?

695
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:55,481
[Alex] She doesn't
know anything.

696
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:56,348
Tell him that

697
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:57,283
I don't know anything.

698
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,585
The owner was supposed to have

699
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,619
hung himself in here.

700
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,687
- [Alex] Ohh!
- [Paul] What?

701
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,956
Oh, when did that shit happen?

702
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,991
You did not mention that,
Alex - [Alex] Do not take
your own way with this.

703
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:05,524
Cause it didn't happen.

704
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,692
It's a rumor.

705
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:07,593
That's why they
call them rumors.

706
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,560
I don't know.

707
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,395
[Paul] Is this something?

708
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,229
Is this local knowledge?

709
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,297
It's the story.

710
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,264
I guess yeah.

711
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,432
It's just a story, Paul.

712
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,301
[Paul] Was he into
Satanic rituals?

713
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,268
Satanic rituals?

714
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:17,203
I wouldn't know, why?

715
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,570
[Paul] Dude, Alex, c'mon,

716
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,440
all the fuckin' wall art
downstairs in the basement.

717
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,508
What about it?

718
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,475
That wasn't you guys?

719
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,443
I thought you did that.

720
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,978
[Paul] No, that shit's OG.

721
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,480
I guess what the story is is,

722
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,350
things kept happening
to the guests here

723
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,751
that forced them to
shut the place down.

724
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,186
[Paul] Whoa, what, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,154
Hold up, hold up.

726
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,555
What happened to the guests?

727
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,057
I'm the worst person to
ask about local history.

728
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,225
I don't know.

729
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,192
They had a great
time, they left,

730
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:41,127
they never heard from them again

731
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,760
because nobody writes reviews in

732
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,195
19-whatever the place.

733
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,596
Exactly, maybe.

734
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,232
I mean, it's supposed
to be haunted,

735
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,533
but, you would know
more than I would.

736
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,535
Have you heard any
bumps in the night? -
[Alex] It's not haunted.

737
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,471
Paul, don't you have some
work to do with Tony?

738
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,539
Doesn't he need a hand?

739
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,074
[Paul] I'm off today.

740
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:56,542
No, there is no off day.

741
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,444
Alright, this is every day work.

742
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,178
What are you...

743
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,412
C'mon.

744
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:01,147
[Paul] Alright,
alright, alright.

745
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,081
I'm outta here.

746
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,049
Just a little kiss real quick.

747
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,016
I'm not kissing the camera.

748
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,417
Can you stop trying to
make me kiss the camera.

749
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,186
[Paul] Alright,
baby, as always.

750
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,420
[Alex] No, this
is not happening.

751
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,621
(kissing)

752
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,057
[Paul] If you need
anything, alright?

753
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,091
You just let me know. -
[Alex] She doesn't need
anything from you, Paul.

754
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,025
Okay.

755
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:13,659
[Paul] Okay, a massage,

756
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,493
I'm a master of oil.

757
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,461
I do appreciate it.

758
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,595
Okay, she was nervous before

759
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:17,563
and now she's scared,
thank you, Paul.

760
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,730
[Paul] Okay, how old
are you, by the way?

761
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:19,731
No, this is not important.

762
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,434
We'll never know what
happened in that hotel.

763
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,173
Just like we'll never know how

764
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,507
the Hell House
crew came to put on

765
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,410
their Halloween tour
their 20 years later.

766
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:34,613
Just like we'll
never know exactly

767
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,115
what happened to Andrew Tully.

768
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,516
The more you dig
into the history

769
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,285
of the Abaddon Hotel,

770
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,120
the more unsettling it gets.

771
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,655
And it all begins with a
man named Andrew Tully.

772
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,324
I'm almost certain
that the group

773
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:49,095
knew nothing about
the hotel going in.

774
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,797
I doubt they knew
anything about Tully.

775
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,800
I doubt they knew anything
about missing guests.

776
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:58,137
Why he built the hotel in
Abaddon in the first place,

777
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,105
any of it.

778
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,239
The local ghost story is that

779
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:02,674
Tully built the hotel
because the name of the town.

780
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,444
In some versions of the bible,

781
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,146
Abaddon is the name of the demon

782
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,548
who guards the gateway to hell.

783
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,384
Some people say that Tully
was the head of some cult

784
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,387
and that he considered himself a

785
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,290
latter-day Dante.

786
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:19,791
[Diane] What
happened to the guests?

787
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,760
Well, there were a few.

788
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,464
But the first one was
an 11 year old girl.

789
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,666
I think she was 11,

790
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,201
and her mother,

791
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,271
both disappeared,

792
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,174
last seen checking
into the hotel.

793
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,408
[Diane] Did
Tully do something?

794
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:37,709
Was he questioned by the police?

795
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,844
Oh yeah.

796
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:39,811
He was questioned by the police.

797
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,313
Multiple times, actually.

798
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:43,182
When that woman and
her daughter disappeared

799
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:46,452
and their last known location
was The Abaddon Hotel,

800
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,687
Tully was able to
produce records

801
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,323
that showed their departure,

802
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:56,128
so he was cleared of
any wrong doing, but...

803
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,230
It wasn't enough to
stop all the questions

804
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,666
and basically kill business.

805
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,268
A few months later,

806
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,336
he hanged himself in the
dining room of the hotel.

807
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,375
(soft eerie music)

808
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:20,219
(footsteps on stairs)

809
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:23,389
[Paul] Jesus Christ
those fuckers are creepy.

810
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,490
[Alex] I guess I'll put Joey...

811
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,458
I'll put Joey right here.

812
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,693
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:28,660
[Alex] We'll get
this guy out of here

814
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:29,528
and I'll put Joey in there,

815
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,729
what do you think?

816
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,863
[Paul] Where's
Melissa gonna go?

817
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,333
Back there on the wall.

818
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:35,634
[Paul] Are we
absolutely certain

819
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,369
that she can't be topless?

820
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:40,672
Paul, if you want to
see her boobies so badly

821
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,474
why don't you just ask her?

822
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,776
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
chicks dig that.

823
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,445
Yeah, especially
from you, bro.

824
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,214
[Paul] Baby, I love you
too much for a lawsuit.

825
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,382
Thank you.

826
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,184
I guess it's not
that big of a deal.

827
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:52,818
[Paul] What?

828
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,552
What's the problem?

829
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:54,820
This dummy,

830
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,388
his head doesn't move so,

831
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:57,723
they'll all have to be
facing the same direction,

832
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,925
rather than one that
way, one this way.

833
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,260
[Paul] Who gives a shit?

834
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,661
They're all fucking
creepy anyways.

835
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,264
That's a really great
mask and I just don't think

836
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,299
we should waste it on a
dummy that doesn't move.

837
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,402
Well, Paul, what do you think?

838
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,304
Do you wanna slap on this mask,

839
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,540
sit down here all night
and stare at Melissa?

840
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:17,909
Of course he does.

841
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,278
It was a joke, bro.

842
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,247
It's never gonna happen.

843
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,682
Fuckin' light.

844
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,856
I just heard a strange noise.

845
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,727
I'm gonna go investigate.

846
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,602
Yo, dude, did you hear that?

847
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,938
Yeah, it sounded
like a scream.

848
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:47,773
[Paul] What the fuck was that?

849
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,275
You guys hear that?

850
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,709
I definitely heard something.

851
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,344
I didn't hear anything.

852
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:55,581
So, we just all woke
up at the same time?

853
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,417
No, you woke me up.

854
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,852
[Mac] Tony, are we
rolling video anywhere?

855
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:01,887
No.

856
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,854
Should we?

857
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:03,889
- [Alex] Yes.
- [Mac] No.

858
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:04,556
No.

859
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:04,990
Yes.

860
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:05,857
No.

861
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:10,396
(creaking)

862
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:20,639
[Paul] Maybe it's
the soundboard?

863
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,280
Some leaky roofs.

864
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,948
Tony's gonna have to fix that.

865
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,017
We could have like a chef guy

866
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,919
standing back here
like going crazy.

867
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:34,886
Remember these?

868
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,822
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

869
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:37,623
You know what I mean?

870
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,757
Chef guy.

871
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,359
He'll be like,
"What do you want?"

872
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:41,527
(laughing)

873
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,628
Sever people, dude.

874
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:43,762
Oh my god.

875
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:44,630
[Paul] A talented
motherfucker.

876
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,965
This is our clown.

877
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,500
Your welcome, guys.

878
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:49,435
You're welcome.

879
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:50,068
[Alex] Thank you, Tony.

880
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:50,802
[Mac] Yeah, good work.

881
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,003
Good work.

882
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,939
I have some stuff
I have to get you

883
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,341
to fill out or whatever.

884
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,609
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

885
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:58,810
Mac with all his...

886
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,546
[Paul] Hey, whatever happened
to the handshake deal, Mac?

887
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,781
Can I get the eye one more
time for camera, dude?

888
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,015
Oh yeah.

889
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:07,686
(yelling)

890
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,054
[Alex] That's so creepy!

891
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,088
[Paul] That's so cool, dude.

892
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,423
Good fucking find, dude.

893
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,658
Yeah, man, thanks.

894
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,893
I just had to send him
down to the basement.

895
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,095
[Paul] Where'd
you find this guy?

896
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,730
The gas station.

897
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:19,898
[Paul] Holy shit.

898
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,667
He was working there
or he was just hanging?

899
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,635
I'm not even sure.

900
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,337
Now, that's bothered
me with it's hair.

901
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,538
But it's frozen, I
love the frozen...

902
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:29,007
Guys, guys, Joey
did his trick again,

903
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,409
and his eye came out.

904
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,777
[All] Whoa! (Screaming)

905
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,113
* I'm writing a letter

906
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,816
* To daddy

907
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:42,421
* His mailbox is inevitable.

908
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,992
[Paul] This room
looks sick, man.

909
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,728
There's a bunch
of babes in here.

910
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,833
This room looks shitty.

911
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,668
Pretty shitty.

912
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:58,937
How's it hangin', boss.

913
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,806
(chains rattling)

914
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,108
(chuckling)

915
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:06,578
Oh, hector.

916
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:07,746
Sup, dude.

917
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,448
What's goin' on?

918
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,717
Where's Alex and Sara?

919
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,620
They went into the city to
get the rest of the stuff.

920
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:15,921
[Paul] Oh, sick.

921
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,389
Where's Tony?

922
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:18,757
I think he's around.

923
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,626
[Paul] Tony?

924
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,362
T-dog.

925
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,769
Oh, dude.

926
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,475
Oh!

927
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,910
I think you've had
enough to drink.

928
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,947
Tony.

929
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,750
Whoa, shit, dude.

930
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,452
What's up, man.

931
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:49,154
What are you looking at?

932
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,526
Holy fuck!

933
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,162
You got me man.

934
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,465
Alright, weirdo.

935
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:02,934
Let me know when you want to
get back to work down there.

936
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,541
(humming)

937
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,545
What the fuck are you do...

938
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,746
You were just right...

939
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,914
What the fuck are
you doing here?

940
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,516
[Tony] I got you a little rat.

941
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,017
[Paul] You fuck...

942
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,120
(running)

943
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,657
What the fuck?

944
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:28,527
What the fuck, man?

945
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,630
You were just standing
right fucking here.

946
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,564
Hello, Alex?

947
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,965
Is that you, you asshole?

948
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,003
What the fuck?

949
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,707
Alex, don't fuck with me.

950
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,774
Dude.

951
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:43,675
Tony, what the fuck?

952
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:47,946
(running)

953
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,082
What, are you fucking with me?

954
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,585
What the fuck was that?

955
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,053
What the fuck was that?

956
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,622
Calm down.

957
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,726
Jesus Paul, how much
shit have you shot today.

958
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:01,960
[Paul] Just watch,
it's coming up.

959
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,697
Oh, I think you've
had enough to drink!

960
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:07,866
(chuckling)

961
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,701
Tony!

962
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:12,237
Whoa, shit, dude.

963
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,606
What's up, man?

964
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,608
What are you looking at?

965
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,246
Holy fuck!

966
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:24,049
Oh my God.

967
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:24,983
Who is that?

968
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,251
How Paul?

969
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,253
How'd you do it?

970
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,621
[Paul] Do what?

971
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,523
You did this.

972
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:33,725
[Paul] Why would I
do this shit, dude?

973
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,994
To fuck with us,
like you always do.

974
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,963
Wait, so it's the two of you?

975
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,297
[Paul] No, I shot this solo.

976
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,131
(laughing)

977
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,733
[Alex] Okay, Romero.

978
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,769
I'm proud of you two.

979
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,003
Great prank.

980
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,539
[Mac] Put that much
work into the haunt.

981
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:52,544
(wind blowing and
birds chirping)

982
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:59,184
[Paul] We built
a haunted house,

983
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,285
we can do a commercial.

984
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,219
Follow my lead.

985
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,788
This is ridiculous, dude.

986
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,289
I just don't want to show
the inside of the house,

987
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,757
because A. We're
not done with it,

988
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,794
and B. I don't want to
give away our scares.

989
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,662
So, I want to do
something kind of

990
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:11,863
catchy and funny.

991
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:14,900
You know, um, he
wasn't there really.

992
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:15,734
You know?

993
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,869
Gerald, Gerald,

994
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:20,038
what are you doing with her?

995
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,140
Gerald!

996
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,742
What is this?

997
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:24,776
Don't overt your eyes.

998
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,777
I thought you were at work.

999
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:29,147
[Paul] I'm not doing
too well cause they...

1000
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,149
Check it out.

1001
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,317
[Paul] What?

1002
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,919
Check out Sara.

1003
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,292
[Paul] What's she doing?

1004
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:43,161
[Tony] Sara!

1005
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:45,831
What are you doing?

1006
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,371
[Paul] Looks good, dude.

1007
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,840
Yeah, it's on.

1008
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,942
[Paul] She's pretty, man.

1009
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,076
Sara?

1010
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,211
Alright, so we're
gonna show you

1011
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,848
all the fine work
that Tone-Dog and I

1012
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,617
have been doing, hard work too.

1013
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:06,918
I'm exhausted.

1014
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,219
[Tony] Alright, man.

1015
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:13,959
Locked and loaded?

1016
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,293
[Paul] I don't
know, you tell me?

1017
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,028
You're good.

1018
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:19,130
Just don't shit your
pants like last time.

1019
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:20,699
[Paul] Alright, good.

1020
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,100
Check the frame in the back.

1021
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:24,703
Does it look right?

1022
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,104
It's not angled through that?

1023
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,038
[Tony] No.

1024
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:28,206
[Paul] Alright, cool.

1025
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,374
[Tony] Perfect.

1026
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,408
[Paul] Alright
dude, lock me in.

1027
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,843
Alright.

1028
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:33,679
(handshake slapping)

1029
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:34,646
[Paul] Cool, dude.

1030
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,682
Godspeed.

1031
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:49,160
(static and voices
over walkie-talkies)

1032
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:52,297
[Paul] Alright,
cue the lights.

1033
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:57,002
[Tony] Lights have been cued.

1034
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,738
[Paul] Cue the strobers.

1035
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,372
[Tony] Strobers cued.

1036
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,411
[Paul] It's pretty good, man.

1037
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:09,681
I think we're in
fucking business man.

1038
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,049
[Tony] Kill it.

1039
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,328
[Paul] Hey man, how
many freaks did we have?

1040
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,365
[Tony] Three freaks.

1041
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,768
Why, what's going on?

1042
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:32,137
[Paul] Are you sure?

1043
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,438
[Tony] Positive.

1044
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,974
[Paul] What the shit?

1045
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,909
(footsteps and pounding)

1046
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:39,911
Tony, let me out.

1047
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:41,246
(knocking)

1048
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:42,447
Let me the fuck out, dude.

1049
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,015
This is not fucking cool.

1050
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,316
Where the fuck are you.

1051
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,054
Tony, let me the fuck out.

1052
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:50,021
Tony, fuck!

1053
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:52,023
Let me the fuck out!

1054
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,365
(gagging and retching)

1055
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,466
[Tony] Dude, are you alright?

1056
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,467
Jesus Christ, man.

1057
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,169
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1058
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:08,306
(eerie music)

1059
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,072
Dude, I'm just
telling you what we saw.

1060
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:42,273
You saw the same thing
that I saw on that screen.

1061
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:43,474
- No, no, no, we all went up there.
- [Paul] and so did Mac,

1062
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,176
- We didn't see anything.
- [Paul] And so did you, Sara.

1063
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,344
First of all, keep
your voice down.

1064
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,113
I don't want any of
the actors to hear you.

1065
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,281
Two weeks to go 'til the show.

1066
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:51,516
They should hear me.

1067
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:52,918
Okay, everybody should
know what's going on.

1068
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:53,919
Two weeks to go
and all our actors

1069
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:55,286
are gonna get scared and
run away because of you.

1070
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,888
What are we gonna do
when we have no actors?

1071
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,256
[Paul] You're talking
like a fucking insane man.

1072
00:45:58,289 --> 00:45:59,324
I'm talking like
a business man.

1073
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:00,158
Do you wanna be here?

1074
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,292
Do you wanna make money?

1075
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,293
Do you want Hell
House to be a success?

1076
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:03,995
Calm down.

1077
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:06,097
I'm sorry you got scared.

1078
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,833
[Paul] This is
fuckin' ridiculous, man.

1079
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:08,566
No, you're ridiculous.

1080
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,567
[Tony] Paul, Paul, Paul.

1081
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,568
Dude, just come back.

1082
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,937
Are you gonna be okay.

1083
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,574
Jesus Christ, Alex.

1084
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,376
Don't you start on me now.

1085
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,545
[Tony] It's
getting worse, man.

1086
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,815
Can you turn the camera off.

1087
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,919
I think Alex was
his own worst enemy.

1088
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,321
For whatever reason he
had up in that hotel,

1089
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:31,890
I think it was...

1090
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,825
I think he believed it was

1091
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:35,894
in the best interest
for the company.

1092
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,462
His company.

1093
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:40,198
That company he created.

1094
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,935
The others were
simply loyal to him.

1095
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:46,304
He and Sara had been
together for years.

1096
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,539
He and McNamera
grew up together.

1097
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,509
They'd known each other
since they were boys.

1098
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:56,247
Tony and Paul were, I
think, his first hires.

1099
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:57,448
Oh yeah.

1100
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,217
Oh, there was a bond there.

1101
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:07,092
(creaking and heavy breathing)

1102
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:14,232
[Paul] Fuck!

1103
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,201
Jesus Christ!

1104
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:21,072
(heavy breathing)

1105
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:21,907
Fuck, dude!

1106
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,908
What are you doing?

1107
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,475
[Paul] Look!

1108
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,210
[Tony] Fuck!

1109
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:26,044
Did you move it?

1110
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:26,878
[Paul] No, man!

1111
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,213
I was fucking sleeping!

1112
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:29,414
[Tony] Are you trying
to fuck with me again?

1113
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,449
[Paul] No!

1114
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:34,285
[Tony] What's it doing there?

1115
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,353
[Paul] I don't know, man.

1116
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:37,889
I was fucking sleeping.

1117
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:39,390
[Tony] Oh, for fucks sake.

1118
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:40,591
Alright.

1119
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,427
[Paul] Be careful!

1120
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,265
(creaking)

1121
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,573
Careful, man.

1122
00:47:57,943 --> 00:47:59,010
(patting)

1123
00:47:59,044 --> 00:47:59,978
What is it?

1124
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,080
It's a fucking mannequin.

1125
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:03,982
Dipshit.

1126
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:10,956
Guess I'll put him in the back.

1127
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:15,293
(creaking)

1128
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:27,405
[Paul] What the fuck?

1129
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:32,077
(Sara mumbling)

1130
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,278
What the shit is she doing up?

1131
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,080
[Tony] Is that Sara?

1132
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,681
Sara?

1133
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:37,415
[Paul] Sara?

1134
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:38,149
[Tony] Sara?

1135
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:41,919
(creaking)

1136
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:45,023
[Paul] Sara?

1137
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,658
What the fuck is
she doing down here?

1138
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,396
Sara?

1139
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,531
(Sara speaking in
a foreign language)

1140
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,600
Sara, are you okay?

1141
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,304
Sara, you okay?

1142
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:01,339
(Sara mumbling)

1143
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,273
[Paul] Don't, Jesus.

1144
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:04,375
Sara!

1145
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,977
(screaming and whimpering)

1146
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:06,611
Sara, Sara.

1147
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:08,179
Sara, Sara, you're fine.

1148
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:08,713
You're fine.

1149
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:09,580
You're okay.

1150
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:10,481
Shhh.

1151
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,382
Sara, you're fine.

1152
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,683
Sara, you're downstairs.

1153
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:13,584
You're fine.

1154
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:14,319
You're fine.

1155
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:15,053
Hey, hey, hey.

1156
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:15,987
You're fine.

1157
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:17,588
[Paul] Jesus fucking Christ.

1158
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,324
It's okay.

1159
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:20,725
What the fuck, dude?

1160
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,727
[Paul] Let's get
the fuck out of here.

1161
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,195
Come here.

1162
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:25,596
Come here.

1163
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,365
You're alright.

1164
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:29,967
[Paul] Oh fuck!

1165
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,470
[Tony] What the fuck?

1166
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:34,105
[Paul] Mac!

1167
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,174
Where the fuck is he?

1168
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,176
He was just fucking here.

1169
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,477
[Sara] Guys, can
we go upstairs?

1170
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:44,349
(heavy breathing)

1171
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:49,287
[Paul] Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1172
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,624
You just fucking put it there.

1173
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,625
Careful, careful.

1174
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:59,097
(heavy breathing)

1175
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:05,803
Okay.

1176
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,172
Okay, guys.

1177
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,806
One, two, three.

1178
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:14,045
(creaking and heavy breathing)

1179
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,518
It's okay.

1180
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,120
There's nothing here.

1181
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:24,589
There's nothing fucking here.

1182
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,291
There's nothing fucking here.

1183
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,526
(heavy breathing)

1184
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,295
I don't fucking know.

1185
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,567
[Paul] You guys okay?

1186
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:37,735
You guys okay?

1187
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,270
Yeah, I'm fine.

1188
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:40,105
(grandfather clock chiming)

1189
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:41,806
(screaming)

1190
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,641
What the fuck?

1191
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:44,809
(grandfather clock chiming)

1192
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,644
(screaming)

1193
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:48,713
- [Paul] Holy shit.
- [Tony] Oh, fuck.

1194
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:49,647
(screaming)

1195
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,415
No!

1196
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:51,816
Oh, fuck!

1197
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,185
[Paul] Holy shit!

1198
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:59,424
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1199
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:03,461
(running upstairs)

1200
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:10,501
(birds chipring)

1201
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:34,559
(sniffling)

1202
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:38,796
It's three days

1203
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,401
until the opening

1204
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,736
of Hell House.

1205
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:49,240
Yippee.

1206
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:53,244
Everyone's a little stressed.

1207
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,482
I personally think

1208
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:00,385
we have no business being here.

1209
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,789
Alex is more
confident than ever.

1210
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,894
Whereas Sara...

1211
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:14,131
She just doesn't look good.

1212
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,836
She usually does.

1213
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:29,914
That's all from me.

1214
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:33,518
Sleep sweet.

1215
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:47,432
(screeching)

1216
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:56,341
(neck cracking)

1217
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,174
Ah, shit.

1218
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,388
Holy fuck!

1219
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:14,392
(trembling)

1220
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,427
What the fuck was that?

1221
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,264
What the fuck was that?

1222
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:23,368
(trembling)

1223
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:25,703
Holy shit!

1224
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:26,904
Holy shit!

1225
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,473
Holy shit!

1226
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:32,477
(gasping)

1227
00:53:57,502 --> 00:54:01,472
(screaming)

1228
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,324
[Tony] Where the
fuck are you, Paul?

1229
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:23,494
(creaking)

1230
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:29,767
I mean, he's not gonna leave

1231
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,636
two days before opening night
without saying anything.

1232
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:32,803
Oh yeah?

1233
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:34,004
2005, he left for
two whole shows

1234
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:35,906
without saying
anything to anybody.

1235
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,774
Alright, he's done it before.

1236
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,343
He's gonna do it again.

1237
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,510
Man, it's just what he does.

1238
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:41,479
[Tony] C'mon Mac,
that was four years ago.

1239
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,381
You're really gonna still
hold that against him?

1240
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:44,915
You think he's gonna change?

1241
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:45,916
Paul's a fuck up.

1242
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:46,984
That's just what he is.

1243
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,386
You can't change that.

1244
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:49,587
[Tony] No, he set
up half these cameras

1245
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,521
in this house himself.

1246
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:51,055
Just hold...

1247
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,390
Hold up, guys.

1248
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:55,426
Have either of you
geniuses called him yet?

1249
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,594
I didn't call him.

1250
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,562
I don't think I
have his phone number.

1251
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:58,429
[Tony] You didn't...

1252
00:54:58,463 --> 00:54:59,930
Just give him a call.

1253
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:01,332
Use my phone.

1254
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,933
The point is, he's
not here right now.

1255
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,435
[Tony] Look, all
his shit is upstairs.

1256
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,970
It's ringing.

1257
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,475
Paul?

1258
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:13,411
(high pitched screaming
and screeching)

1259
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:13,944
(phone breaking)

1260
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,813
[Tony] Fuck?

1261
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,848
What the fuck was that?

1262
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:19,817
Alex.

1263
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,519
What was that?

1264
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,320
I don't know.

1265
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,762
Alex!

1266
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:37,435
(eerie piano music)

1267
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:39,003
Fuck.

1268
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:42,973
Mac?

1269
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,842
You hear that right?

1270
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,511
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

1271
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:48,045
Who is it?

1272
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,980
Maybe Paul?

1273
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:52,717
What are you guys doing?

1274
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,684
Will you stop?

1275
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:55,386
Someone's downstairs.

1276
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,587
We think it might be Paul.

1277
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:58,856
Stay with Sara, Tony.

1278
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:03,394
(eerie piano music
and creaking steps)

1279
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:12,937
Coming from the front room?

1280
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,938
[Tony] Yeah.

1281
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:15,039
Okay.

1282
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:22,447
[Tony] Hey, hey, Mac.

1283
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,881
Wait up, man.

1284
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,516
Relax, it's fine.

1285
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,652
It's just Paul
fucking with us again.

1286
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:32,022
(creaking and eerie piano music)

1287
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,515
Seriously?

1288
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,453
Paul?

1289
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:03,220
(keys slamming on piano)

1290
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,522
What the fuck was that?

1291
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:05,790
Oh fuck!

1292
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:08,726
(low thumping and yelling)

1293
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,960
Paul!

1294
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,864
[Tony] What the fuck?

1295
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:15,666
Paul, are you in here?

1296
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,667
You in here?

1297
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:18,936
[Tony] Shit!

1298
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,906
Paul!

1299
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,708
[Tony] What the
fuck is going on?

1300
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:28,445
(heavy breathing)

1301
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,716
Jesus fucking Christ, Paul!

1302
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,220
[Tony] Dude, what the fuck.

1303
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:41,091
(creaking steps)

1304
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,860
Careful, man.

1305
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,498
We're gonna fucking
die on these steps.

1306
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,837
Okay, I'll lock the storm door.

1307
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:53,871
[Tony] You sure?

1308
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,506
Yeah.

1309
00:58:07,752 --> 00:58:09,887
Paul!

1310
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,132
Paul!

1311
00:58:23,768 --> 00:58:26,671
[Tony] Fuck!

1312
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:27,972
You back here?

1313
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,008
(heavy breathing)

1314
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,610
Paul?

1315
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:39,617
[Tony] Mac, do
you see anything?

1316
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:41,886
I don't see anything.

1317
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,087
[Tony] Fuck!

1318
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,257
(heavy breathing)

1319
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:54,098
Oh fuck.

1320
00:58:58,736 --> 00:58:59,269
Check it.

1321
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,170
What?

1322
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,205
[Tony] Check it.

1323
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,776
[Mac] Nothing.

1324
00:59:07,812 --> 00:59:09,046
[Tony] Fuck!

1325
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,047
Go, go, go.

1326
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,181
What?

1327
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,717
What?

1328
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,785
[Tony] The clowns!

1329
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:15,920
The fucking clowns!

1330
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,788
Their heads!

1331
00:59:17,822 --> 00:59:18,923
Oh my god.

1332
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:20,057
Their heads moved.

1333
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,760
They were fucking turned.

1334
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:27,364
(heavy breathing)

1335
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,365
[Mac] Tony their
heads don't move.

1336
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,333
You told me...

1337
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,001
[Tony] They fucking moved!

1338
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:32,903
Holy fucking shit.

1339
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:33,838
Tony, look at me.

1340
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,006
Do you believe in ghosts?

1341
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,007
[Tony] Yes.

1342
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:37,808
Yeah

1343
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:39,610
I don't.

1344
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:40,645
Look at me.

1345
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:41,779
Okay?

1346
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,749
Now, we're gonna go out there,

1347
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:45,382
and it'll be fine.

1348
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,017
[Tony] No.

1349
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:47,952
No.

1350
00:59:47,985 --> 00:59:48,819
We're gonna go back out there.

1351
00:59:48,853 --> 00:59:49,654
We're gonna be fine.

1352
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:51,255
Alright?

1353
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:53,190
[Tony] You're fucking crazy.

1354
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,359
[Mac] On the count of three.

1355
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:57,061
[Tony] No, no, just...

1356
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,097
[Mac] One, two, three.

1357
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,999
(yelling)

1358
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:06,203
[Tony] Fuck!

1359
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,972
(screaming)

1360
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:09,740
They fucking moved.

1361
01:00:09,774 --> 01:00:10,374
I fucking swear.

1362
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:11,108
[Mac] I believe you.

1363
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:11,742
I believe you.

1364
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:12,376
Okay?

1365
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:14,078
It's Paul.

1366
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,981
He's fucking with us again.

1367
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:19,183
[Tony] Dude, I
have it on fucking...

1368
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,085
[Mac] I don't
know how he got out.

1369
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,820
Fuck!

1370
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:24,054
Paul!

1371
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:27,357
Holy shit!

1372
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:29,426
[Tony] What the fuck?

1373
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,662
Hey, look at me.

1374
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:34,131
Hey, fuck stick, wake up.

1375
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:35,165
I know you're fucking with us.

1376
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,966
[Tony] Paul.

1377
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,901
Paul, wake up.

1378
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,969
[Mac] Open your little eyes.

1379
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:40,905
[Tony] Paul, oh fuck!

1380
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,708
[Mac] What the fuck's
wrong with you, huh?

1381
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:44,909
[Tony] Shit.

1382
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,744
[Mac] Why are you
pulling this shit now?

1383
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:48,312
Everyone's on edge.

1384
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,214
You're just fucking
with us, aren't you?

1385
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,248
Huh?

1386
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,282
[Tony] Paul, come back.

1387
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,151
[Mac] Fuck him.

1388
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,758
[Tony] You alright, man?

1389
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:01,892
[Mac] C'mon!

1390
01:01:01,926 --> 01:01:03,794
[Tony] C'mon, man.

1391
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:04,995
I'm telling you.

1392
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:06,296
We have to call
it off, right now.

1393
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,865
Why?

1394
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:08,432
[Tony] Why?

1395
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:09,299
Why?

1396
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,035
I'll tell you why.

1397
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:13,270
This clown?

1398
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,172
It's head doesn't fucking turn

1399
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:17,441
and it turned last night
when we were down here,

1400
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:19,176
as long with these two as well.

1401
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,444
[Alex] We're not
shutting down, Tony.

1402
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:21,812
Yeah, we're
shutting down, dude.

1403
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:23,013
It's not safe anymore.

1404
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:24,181
[Alex] I'll tell you
what I can't explain

1405
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:25,850
is how scared you are right now.

1406
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:26,984
[Tony] Yeah, I'm
fucking scared.

1407
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,385
[Alex] Paul's back,
Isn't that good?

1408
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,319
[Tony] Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1409
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,187
Paul's back.

1410
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,321
He's technically back.

1411
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,189
But he hasn't said
a fucking word

1412
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:33,323
since he's been here.

1413
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,725
He just fucking sits there.

1414
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,060
[Mac] Which pretty
much makes him

1415
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:37,327
as useless as he always was.

1416
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,963
[Tony] Fuck you, Mac.

1417
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:39,997
Fuck you.

1418
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,398
You were fucking down here.

1419
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,800
You were down here - [Mac]
What do you want me to say?

1420
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,001
[Tony] And you saw
what fucking happened,

1421
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,335
and now you're gonna
make a fucking joke

1422
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,806
right now to Alex,
your fucking best bud.

1423
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,908
Fuck you, man.

1424
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:54,378
Explain to me right now how
that fucking head turned.

1425
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:55,746
I haven't figured
that part out yet.

1426
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,947
You haven't fucking
figured it out.

1427
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:58,148
No shit, you haven't
figured it out!

1428
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:00,785
There's nothing to figure out.

1429
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,519
It can't fucking
turn, but it did.

1430
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,088
Tony, we don't
have time for this.

1431
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,189
It's fucking opening
night tomorrow,

1432
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,490
I don't fucking care, okay?

1433
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:07,491
I'm out.

1434
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:08,826
Alright, you're quitting?

1435
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:09,459
That's what this is?

1436
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,028
[Tony] I'm quitting.

1437
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,030
Yeah, write it down in
your stupid fucking book.

1438
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,331
That I'm fucking quitting.
I'll make sure to date
and sign it for you.

1439
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:15,399
Aright.

1440
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:16,466
[Tony] Fuck you.

1441
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,002
Fuck you, Mac.

1442
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:18,535
See ya, Tony.

1443
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,270
Let him go.

1444
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:22,306
[Mac] Hey, hey, hey, Tony!

1445
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:26,911
Tony!

1446
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:29,146
Tony, come here!

1447
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:30,280
Come here.

1448
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:31,849
You're a fucking asshole.

1449
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:32,983
You're a fucking...

1450
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:34,351
You just stand there?

1451
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,552
[Mac] Hold on.

1452
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,954
You don't understand
everything, alright.

1453
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:37,888
You don't have all the facts.

1454
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:38,923
I don't fucking care.

1455
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:39,523
[Mac] You don't understand.

1456
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:40,925
Stop!

1457
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:41,458
[Tony] I'm taking
the fucking sign down.

1458
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,860
[Mac] Stop!

1459
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:43,994
Look, just listen to
what I have to say,

1460
01:02:44,028 --> 01:02:45,529
and then you can
take off if you want.

1461
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:46,530
But you need to listen to this.

1462
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:48,132
You have to hear this.

1463
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,167
What?

1464
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:53,470
Jesus.

1465
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:57,441
(video tuning and
high frequency sounds)

1466
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:11,388
I can't leave.

1467
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,395
Mac's right.

1468
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,466
I can't leave.

1469
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,815
You okay?

1470
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,953
No, not really.

1471
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:48,058
This whole time,

1472
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:51,628
you knew, but you
didn't tell me.

1473
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,367
I should've told
you sooner, but...

1474
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:01,338
And now...

1475
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,042
We're fucked.

1476
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:08,012
Fucking Alex.

1477
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:12,416
He fucking screwed us.

1478
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:24,261
Does anyone else know?

1479
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:28,132
Just me and Alex.

1480
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:31,235
You haven't told Sara?

1481
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:33,203
No.

1482
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,372
I know you haven't told Paul.

1483
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:36,740
No.

1484
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,646
You know what's
really scary though?

1485
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,581
What?

1486
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:47,551
Is why he's not telling him.

1487
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:57,227
Well, you're staying,

1488
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:59,563
so I'll stay.

1489
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:06,303
I kind of have to.

1490
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:08,205
I'm sorry.

1491
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,376
You're not the one
that should apologize.

1492
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:18,015
Alright.

1493
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,118
See you back there?

1494
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,286
Yeah.

1495
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,620
Sure.

1496
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,727
[Diane] So, when
opening night arrived,

1497
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,464
was there anything technically
wrong with the house?

1498
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,166
Was there any gear or props that

1499
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,503
were malfunctioning that
maybe could have hurt someone?

1500
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,138
No.

1501
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,106
[Diane] To the best
of your knowledge,

1502
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,641
were you prepared and
ready for opening night?

1503
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,010
Yeah.

1504
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:50,447
[Diane] Was Alex
of sound mind?

1505
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:53,183
What do you mean?

1506
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:55,986
[Diane] What I mean
to say is, was Alex...

1507
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,687
Was Alex...

1508
01:05:57,721 --> 01:05:59,156
Fit to run the show...

1509
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:02,059
Was there anything
on management's end

1510
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:05,295
that maybe could have
caused the tragedy?

1511
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:08,432
Alex was the same as always.

1512
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:14,371
He did a good job of
rallying the actors,

1513
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,507
and Tony and Mac.

1514
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,744
He told me that
it would be okay,

1515
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,349
and I believed him.

1516
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:30,787
[Diane] Sara, why
did you not leave?

1517
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:37,361
Alex wasn't gonna
leave the house.

1518
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:40,230
What was I supposed to do?

1519
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:42,366
[Diane] I understand.

1520
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:44,768
Leading up to that point,

1521
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:48,004
did you notice anything
that raised any alarms?

1522
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,411
That clown guy that was
running against traffic.

1523
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,246
He shot right past us,

1524
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,248
as we neared the basement.

1525
01:06:58,282 --> 01:07:00,117
I remember thinking, "If
this is a part of the show",

1526
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,651
"then it's pretty lame."

1527
01:07:04,288 --> 01:07:07,057
But, of course, it wasn't.

1528
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:13,263
We got close to the bottom
of the basement steps.

1529
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:15,365
We couldn't move anymore.

1530
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:17,401
I mean, nobody could.

1531
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,436
[Diane] Why?

1532
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,774
Cause everyone that was
already in the basement

1533
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:27,711
was trying to get out.

1534
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:40,524
I went into Abaddon,

1535
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,292
you know, out of New York.

1536
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:45,295
Last year was actually

1537
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:48,198
our biggest opening.

1538
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:51,501
Even Sara said that...

1539
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:56,840
I haven't seen Paul
around in a few days.

1540
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,442
Is he okay or?

1541
01:07:58,475 --> 01:08:00,510
[Alex] Paul?

1542
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:02,279
Paul's fine, yeah.

1543
01:08:02,312 --> 01:08:02,846
Why would you...

1544
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:04,348
Yeah, don't...

1545
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:05,849
He's a little under the weather,

1546
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:07,817
but he's okay.

1547
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:10,120
We'll have to run without him,

1548
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:12,156
but don't worry about crew.

1549
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:13,757
We're gonna be...

1550
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,659
We're gonna be alright.

1551
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:17,261
Scaring some people.

1552
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:18,595
(laughing)

1553
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,564
Let's scare some people tonight.

1554
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:27,804
A lot of them are gonna
come through here.

1555
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,607
Yeah, great.

1556
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,343
Let's get into
costume and makeup

1557
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:34,678
and go get ready.

1558
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:35,479
Awesome.

1559
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:36,346
Thank you.

1560
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:36,880
Awesome.

1561
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:37,881
Thank you.

1562
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,115
Thanks.

1563
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,521
What's up, man.

1564
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:46,390
[Tony] Hey.

1565
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:49,593
I'm sorry.

1566
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,495
I know it's been a while.

1567
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:53,663
But I shouldn't have

1568
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:56,233
reacted like I did.

1569
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:57,767
[Alex] You alright?

1570
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,469
[Tony] I hope so.

1571
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:01,338
[Alex] We're
alright, we're alright.

1572
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,306
Alright?

1573
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:03,907
You know I can't run
this without you, man.

1574
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,310
You know that.

1575
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,345
(creaking)

1576
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:10,380
[Tony] Paul?

1577
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:13,350
Yo, Paul.

1578
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:16,253
Paul, wake up.

1579
01:09:16,286 --> 01:09:19,389
C'mon buddy, wake up.

1580
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:23,427
Paul.

1581
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:34,538
Whoa, check it out.

1582
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:35,705
How beautiful is this?

1583
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:36,940
[Tony] Oh, I love it.

1584
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,475
You can't come over
and not see the sign.

1585
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,209
[Tony] No.

1586
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:40,210
Not at all.

1587
01:09:40,244 --> 01:09:41,378
Alright, take a look
at this crowd for me.

1588
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,546
Take a look at this crowd.

1589
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:43,547
[Tony] What do
we got down here?

1590
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,249
Oh yeah!

1591
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:46,216
[Alex] Oh my god!

1592
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,818
[Tony] Oh, I can't
wait to pee my pants!

1593
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:52,322
They're gonna be so
scared in a few minutes.

1594
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:53,723
[Alex] Oh, good luck
trying to scare me.

1595
01:09:53,757 --> 01:09:56,726
[Mac] Okay, are
you guys ready to go?

1596
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,962
Are you filming right now?

1597
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,597
[Mac] Yeah, yeah,
we're all set.

1598
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,899
You have the keys to
her chains, right?

1599
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,601
Alright, keep an
eye on her, big guy.

1600
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:05,669
She's gonna be alright.

1601
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:06,870
[Mac] Okay.

1602
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,438
Alright.

1603
01:10:08,472 --> 01:10:09,706
Let's have some fun
out there, you guys.

1604
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:11,275
Hey, Mac.

1605
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,510
Is everything alright?

1606
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,711
[Mac] Yeah.

1607
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:16,713
Everything's fine.

1608
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:19,716
You would tell me if
something was wrong, right?

1609
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:20,784
[Mac] Of course.

1610
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:23,453
It's not a big deal.

1611
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,654
Okay?

1612
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:25,522
Alright.

1613
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,524
Let's get goin' guys.

1614
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,493
I'm just gonna get
this finished up.

1615
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:30,694
Now it might be a little cold.

1616
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,529
I'm sorry.

1617
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,468
When do people
usually get here?

1618
01:10:38,502 --> 01:10:40,904
[Mac] We open the doors at 8.

1619
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:45,442
Alright, I'm just gonna do...

1620
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:48,745
(laughing)

1621
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,013
This is so exciting.

1622
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:51,548
(laughing)

1623
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,017
[Mac] Alright, here we go.

1624
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,019
See you later.

1625
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:58,254
Bye.

1626
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:06,363
(footsteps on stairs)

1627
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,503
Hi, Sam, can you hear me?

1628
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,407
We open in exactly 10 minutes.

1629
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:18,742
I need everybody
ready, in position,

1630
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:19,676
ready to go.

1631
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:21,645
You heard from Paul at all?

1632
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:22,646
No.

1633
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:23,880
Still sleeping.

1634
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,749
It's creepy.

1635
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:28,418
It's not creepy,
it's annoying.

1636
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:31,588
Hey, Mac, have you heard
from Paul at all on your end?

1637
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,056
There he is.

1638
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,758
[Mac] No.

1639
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,527
Mac, can you hold down
your button, please,

1640
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:39,429
when you speak to me.

1641
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:43,032
Wow.

1642
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:44,334
We lost him.

1643
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:45,502
That's his
walkie-talkies, man.

1644
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:48,004
Mac, just start recording
whenever you're ready, alright.

1645
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,406
I told you to get
the better ones.

1646
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:49,973
I thought...

1647
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:53,343
(feedback)

1648
01:11:53,377 --> 01:11:55,479
Ask him if he
knows sign language.

1649
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,351
Alright, get into position.

1650
01:12:01,385 --> 01:12:02,719
We'll talk to you when
this is all over, alright?

1651
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:04,588
Alright.

1652
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:10,460
Off to a good
start, broken walkies.

1653
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:13,430
It'll be alright.

1654
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:15,732
It's not gonna stop us.

1655
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:19,603
Let's go.

1656
01:12:22,606 --> 01:12:24,441
Welcome, everyone.

1657
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:28,478
(cheering and applause)

1658
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:39,456
I hope you all
have a reservation.

1659
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:41,891
No one gets in
without a reservation.

1660
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:46,062
A little more mist.

1661
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,631
Pump it up, pump it up.

1662
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:48,798
Alright, all this looks good.

1663
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:49,633
We're down in bathroom.

1664
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:51,034
We're down in bathroom.

1665
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:52,436
Cue steam.

1666
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,670
Love it.

1667
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,872
Alright, we're circling
around the dining room.

1668
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:58,141
I love the kitchen gag.

1669
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:01,978
(people talking in line)

1670
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:04,648
[Voiceover] We're next,
we're next, we're next.

1671
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,818
How many people are
they letting in at a time?

1672
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,388
It's a long wait.

1673
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,192
(scream in the distance)

1674
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,894
[Mac] Keep the line
moving, you guys,

1675
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:19,996
I want people in and out.

1676
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,765
We need some strobe.

1677
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:24,067
Kick up the strobe
in the rat room.

1678
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,737
A wonderful scare, here we go.

1679
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:28,838
I love this guy.

1680
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:30,640
I think we're next.

1681
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:31,808
Exciting.

1682
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:34,578
We've been waiting for you.

1683
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:37,947
I hope you all enjoy your stay.

1684
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:42,452
(creaking and screaming)

1685
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:58,535
[Mac] Sara?

1686
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,536
What are you doing?

1687
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:00,537
I think I just saw Paul.

1688
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,170
[Mac] Paul?

1689
01:14:01,204 --> 01:14:02,005
Where?

1690
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:03,740
And he looked at me.

1691
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,008
[Mac] I'll take care of it.

1692
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:05,742
I'll take care of it.

1693
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,110
Don't worry.

1694
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:10,046
Joey!

1695
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:11,147
Alex.

1696
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,682
Alex.

1697
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:14,083
Alex, Joey just ran
out of the basement,

1698
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:15,552
what's going on down there?

1699
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:17,153
There's Joey.

1700
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,689
Where's Joey going?

1701
01:14:19,723 --> 01:14:21,825
Son of a bitch!

1702
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:23,026
(screaming and creaking)

1703
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,828
[Sara] Did you hear that?

1704
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:26,229
What the fuck was that?

1705
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:30,199
(screaming)

1706
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:32,268
[Mac] Go back upstairs and
find out what's going on.

1707
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,270
Go, go, go.

1708
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:39,509
(screaming)

1709
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:47,651
Is that supposed to happened?

1710
01:14:47,684 --> 01:14:50,219
[Voiceover] Technical
difficulties on opening night.

1711
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:51,988
[Mac] Alex, come in.

1712
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,623
Alex, I have no eyes
in the basement.

1713
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:55,158
Something's up.

1714
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:57,260
Alex.

1715
01:14:57,293 --> 01:14:59,295
Pick up your walkie.

1716
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:04,233
(laughing and talking)

1717
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:10,239
[Voiceover] Gross.

1718
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:15,845
You have the key,
Joey, get me out of here.

1719
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:17,614
Please, please,
somebody get help.

1720
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:19,048
This isn't part of the show.

1721
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,585
Joey!

1722
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,252
Joey, no!

1723
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:26,255
Joey, don't leave me, please.

1724
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:28,324
Get me out of here.

1725
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,759
(crying)

1726
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:30,193
Are you okay?

1727
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:31,227
No.

1728
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,029
No, this isn't part of the show.

1729
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,030
Please.

1730
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:35,699
Please, get help.

1731
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:40,303
(screaming and scrambling)

1732
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:58,314
(creaking and screaming)

1733
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:04,287
[Mac] Go, go, go,
go, go, get out!

1734
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:08,725
(knocking)

1735
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:12,161
Hello, anybody?

1736
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:13,830
Fuck!

1737
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:17,333
There's another
way out over here.

1738
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:22,271
(footsteps and loud sirens)

1739
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:25,041
Tony, Tony, get to the basement.

1740
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:25,909
What's going on
in the basement?

1741
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:27,043
[Mac] Go!

1742
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:31,881
Oh fuck!

1743
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:39,022
[Mac] What's going on?

1744
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,293
[Melissa] Please,
somebody let me out of here.

1745
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,261
[Mac] Tony!

1746
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:46,129
Tony!

1747
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,164
(screaming)

1748
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:49,365
Tony!

1749
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:54,270
(heaving breathing)

1750
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:59,308
(sirens and yelling)

1751
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,044
(heavy breathing)

1752
01:18:01,077 --> 01:18:01,911
Go back up.

1753
01:18:01,945 --> 01:18:02,779
Go back up.

1754
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:03,913
Go!

1755
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:08,752
Go!

1756
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:10,253
Attic, attic!

1757
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:15,291
(footsteps and heavy breathing)

1758
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:20,096
(screaming)

1759
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,330
Alex!

1760
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:22,131
Alex!

1761
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:23,199
C'mon!

1762
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:27,370
(screaming)

1763
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:36,712
(scrambled tape and screaming)

1764
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:46,255
(police and ambulance sirens)

1765
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:59,235
I came down the
stairs from the attic

1766
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:02,138
and when I got to the front door

1767
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:05,208
the police were arriving.

1768
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:10,413
I was just happy to be alive.

1769
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:15,084
They didn't ask me any
questions or anything.

1770
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:18,321
They just rushed me out.

1771
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,991
[Diane] Nothing
happened to you

1772
01:19:22,025 --> 01:19:24,493
from the attic all the
way to the front door?

1773
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:27,063
You just left?

1774
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,431
Yeah.

1775
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:33,036
[Diane] How...

1776
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:36,139
If this is all true, how
was it kept from the public

1777
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:37,506
for so long?

1778
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,441
I'm sorry,

1779
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:41,177
I'm just feeling really tired,

1780
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,412
do you think that we
could maybe take a break.

1781
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,280
[Diane] Of course, of course.

1782
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:45,148
I'm so sorry.

1783
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:46,082
Jonathan, will you...

1784
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,817
I keep throwing these
questions at you,

1785
01:19:47,851 --> 01:19:49,986
and I know you've
gotta be exhausted.

1786
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:50,954
Can we get you water?

1787
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:53,122
Do you want any water
or anything to eat?

1788
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,995
Well, let's get you
a room to rest in.

1789
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:00,229
[Sara] Oh, I
already have a room.

1790
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:02,899
It's 2C.

1791
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,267
If you could just give
me a couple hours,

1792
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,203
you can come find me there.

1793
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:07,937
[Diane] I will.

1794
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:08,972
Thank you.

1795
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,415
Thanks, but it's all boarded up

1796
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:21,517
and I just can not get a permit.

1797
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:29,258
Maybe.

1798
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:30,927
I'll talk to the guys.

1799
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,561
Thanks.

1800
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:38,868
[Voiceover] I mean, the
place is all boarded up,

1801
01:20:38,902 --> 01:20:40,069
what, are we gonna break in?

1802
01:20:40,103 --> 01:20:41,037
[Diane] So what,
yeah, why not?

1803
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,438
I mean it's 5 in the morning.

1804
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:43,973
Nobody's gonna be there.

1805
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:45,174
[Voiceover] Yeah,
I'm with Diane.

1806
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,042
I think it'd be worth
it to get inside.

1807
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,010
[Diane] Thank you.

1808
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:48,611
What are you afraid of a little

1809
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,546
g-g-g-ghost?

1810
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:51,514
[Voiceover] Fine.

1811
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:52,381
We have one hour, though.

1812
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:53,249
[Diane] Perfect.

1813
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:54,117
[Voiceover] One hour.

1814
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:54,884
[Diane] Can do.

1815
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:56,085
Grab the camera.

1816
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,086
Will you finish going
through the footage?

1817
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:57,954
I want to look at it today.

1818
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:58,621
[Voiceover] Got it.

1819
01:20:58,654 --> 01:20:59,355
[Diane] Yes? Good.

1820
01:20:59,388 --> 01:20:59,522
Thank you.

1821
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:06,996
We're gonna step
out for a minute.

1822
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,497
If the woman in 2C asks for me,

1823
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,499
can you tell her we'll
be back in like an hour?

1824
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:11,334
2C?

1825
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,535
Yeah.

1826
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:13,502
Our rooms don't
have any letters.

1827
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:16,439
Um, she did say 2C, right?

1828
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:17,640
[Voiceover] Yeah, 2C.

1829
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:18,975
Can you tell me what room

1830
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:20,076
Sara Havel is
staying in, please?

1831
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:20,609
Sure.

1832
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:22,311
Thank you.

1833
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:30,219
There isn't a Sara
Havel staying here.

1834
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:35,358
Do you think maybe...

1835
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,926
[Voiceover]
She's probably just

1836
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,927
staying under another
name or something, c'mon.

1837
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:39,362
Thank you very much.

1838
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,563
[Voiceover] Do you wanna
go see this house or not?

1839
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:58,381
(distant screaming and creaking)

1840
01:22:05,388 --> 01:22:10,293
(gasping and crying)

1841
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:25,341
(creaking)

1842
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:36,352
(creaky door opening)

1843
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:54,270
(footsteps and breathing)

1844
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:40,349
(kicking and scrambled tape)

1845
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:05,308
(choking)

1846
01:24:12,315 --> 01:24:17,320
(low growling and whimpering)

1847
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:34,370
(video tape scratching)

1848
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:14,310
(choking and gasping)

1849
01:25:19,315 --> 01:25:23,286
(pounding)

1850
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:26,322
(tape malfunctioning)

1851
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,363
(car door opening)

1852
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,270
Nobody's around.

1853
01:25:43,406 --> 01:25:46,409
(door creaking)

1854
01:25:55,684 --> 01:25:57,620
[Voiceover] Are we looking
for anything specific here?

1855
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,288
What are we trying to do?

1856
01:25:59,322 --> 01:26:02,391
Oh my god!

1857
01:26:03,426 --> 01:26:04,627
Oh my god!

1858
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,895
Do you remember
that this is where...

1859
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:08,564
[Voiceover] What?

1860
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:19,242
Yeah, this is.

1861
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:21,644
This a wall where...

1862
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,979
So the kitchen would be...

1863
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,448
[Voiceover] I feel like
we're getting asbestos

1864
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:26,715
of something in here.

1865
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:27,916
Can we get out of here?

1866
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:31,387
This is where
the strobe light...

1867
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,690
(creaking door and footsteps)

1868
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:35,891
[Voiceover] Kitchen.

1869
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,961
[Diane] Well, I think the
tour continues that way, right?

1870
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:39,962
[Voiceover] I don't
think we're gonna be

1871
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:41,764
able to go back that way.

1872
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:45,268
[Diane] Well, let's
find another way.

1873
01:26:45,301 --> 01:26:47,470
[Voiceover] Alright.

1874
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:49,405
It's the basement.

1875
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:50,706
(creaking door)

1876
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:52,341
It's the basement.

1877
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:53,976
Oh my god!

1878
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:55,278
Look at the blood!

1879
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:56,979
Can you see that?

1880
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,715
Get that shot!

1881
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:00,549
Get that shot!

1882
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:01,284
Look at that.

1883
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:02,017
Look at that.

1884
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:02,651
[Voiceover] Oh, fuck that.

1885
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:03,286
Let's...

1886
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:03,719
No.

1887
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:04,653
I'm not.

1888
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:05,388
It looks like a hand print.

1889
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:05,921
Look here.

1890
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:07,323
Do you see it?

1891
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:07,856
[Voiceover] I
don't give a shit.

1892
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:08,457
Let's not.

1893
01:27:08,491 --> 01:27:08,991
Nope.

1894
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:09,858
Let's just go.

1895
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:11,260
Okay, you're right.

1896
01:27:11,294 --> 01:27:11,994
[Voiceover] Hey,
let's go in here.

1897
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:12,728
Careful, watch your foot.

1898
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:13,929
Watch your foot.

1899
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,764
This is where they had
the bartender there.

1900
01:27:15,798 --> 01:27:17,433
[Voiceover] Oh fuck.

1901
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:18,701
It's all fake, right?

1902
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:22,771
Oh.

1903
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:27,610
Alright, c'mon.

1904
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:29,645
We gotta find the kitchen.

1905
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,347
[Voiceover] Yeah,
I don't want to...

1906
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,381
Watch this, watch this guy.

1907
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,783
Oh man.

1908
01:27:39,522 --> 01:27:41,390
C'mon.

1909
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:42,891
[Voiceover] Maybe it
just goes round and round.

1910
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,460
Look how dumb, look here.

1911
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:45,494
[Voiceover] Ah, fuck.

1912
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:46,662
This is insane.

1913
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:48,397
Oh my god.

1914
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:50,499
[Voiceover] Alright,
no, that doesn't...

1915
01:27:50,533 --> 01:27:51,467
(piano keys)

1916
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,301
Right, of course it does.

1917
01:27:52,335 --> 01:27:53,035
That makes sense.

1918
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:54,002
Oh, don't be such a pussy.

1919
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:54,970
C'mon, we're not even...

1920
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:57,506
[Voiceover] Can you
just like slow down?

1921
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:58,741
Hey, get this.

1922
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,843
Oh my god!

1923
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:02,878
Look at that shit.

1924
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,847
Look at them.

1925
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:10,319
(laughing)

1926
01:28:10,353 --> 01:28:10,986
Oh my god.

1927
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:12,555
[Voiceover] Who is it?

1928
01:28:12,588 --> 01:28:13,322
It's Mitchell, I'll
call him on the way back.

1929
01:28:13,356 --> 01:28:14,490
C'mon.

1930
01:28:14,523 --> 01:28:16,325
That would take us to the other
end of the kitchen, maybe?

1931
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:17,493
If we...

1932
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:18,827
That's not it.

1933
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:20,963
[Voiceover] It's the
stairs, right there.

1934
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:22,498
We gotta go up the stairs.

1935
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:24,967
[Voiceover] Yeah,
sure, of course we do.

1936
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,405
(footsteps on creaky steps.)

1937
01:28:29,438 --> 01:28:31,540
See the security
cameras everywhere?

1938
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:33,576
[Voiceover] Yeah.

1939
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,544
So this locks.

1940
01:28:35,578 --> 01:28:37,480
[Voiceover] That's
fucking creepy.

1941
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:37,946
Hold on, let me turn this lamp...

1942
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,448
Fuck.

1943
01:28:39,482 --> 01:28:41,750
[Voiceover] What is that?

1944
01:28:41,784 --> 01:28:44,553
She said 2C, right?

1945
01:28:44,587 --> 01:28:45,454
[Voiceover] What the fuck?

1946
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,122
I mean, do you think...

1947
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,624
I mean...

1948
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:49,858
[Voiceover] No, what?

1949
01:28:49,892 --> 01:28:52,060
Don't fucking open that!

1950
01:28:52,094 --> 01:28:54,430
It's what we're here for.

1951
01:28:54,463 --> 01:28:55,631
We're here to...

1952
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:56,565
[Voiceover] We're
not here to fucking

1953
01:28:56,599 --> 01:28:57,566
go into a creepy ass room.

1954
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,801
I am.

1955
01:28:58,834 --> 01:28:59,968
[Voiceover] Diane!

1956
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:00,703
Diane, don't.

1957
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:01,770
Shut up.

1958
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:03,472
Oh my god!

1959
01:29:10,646 --> 01:29:12,715
C'mon, on me.

1960
01:29:14,617 --> 01:29:16,118
[Voiceover] Don't
fucking go in there.

1961
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:17,085
Sara?

1962
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,522
Honey, are you okay?

1963
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:20,956
[Voiceover] Don't.

1964
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:23,492
Sara.

1965
01:29:25,928 --> 01:29:26,862
[Voiceover] Let's
get the fuck out...

1966
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:27,596
(door slamming and screaming)

1967
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:28,431
Holy fuck!

1968
01:29:28,464 --> 01:29:28,964
[Diane] Oh my god!

1969
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:29,698
Oh my god!

1970
01:29:29,732 --> 01:29:31,600
Help me!

1971
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:32,801
Oh my god!

1972
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:33,736
[Voiceover] What
the fuck is that?

1973
01:29:33,769 --> 01:29:38,006
(screaming and video scrambling)

1974
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:50,919
(eerie piano music)

1975
01:30:03,499 --> 01:30:06,502
(haunting instrumental music)
