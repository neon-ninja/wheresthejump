1
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,552
Is it me
or is the smell getting worse down there?

2
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,712
I told you before,
it changes from one area to the next.

3
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,756
This is actually the fresh part.

4
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,552
- Fresh?
- Mm.

5
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,393
It's like,
how many different ways can shit stink?

6
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,835
It depends which area you're in.

7
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,597
If you're in the sewers under Chinatown,
there's a strange kind of seafood smell to it all.

8
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,389
- Whereas in Soho, you've got...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

9
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,837
This ain't the fucking Discovery Channel.
I only need to know the basics, man.

10
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,876
I'm just trying to educate you.

11
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,838
Trust me,
there's nothing I want to know about shit.

12
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,599
Now... this is the kind of thing
we're on the look for.

13
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,076
You see... if this ain't cleared,

14
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,870
the people upstairs are gonna be trading turds
through their kitchen sinks.

15
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,588
<i>- What is it?
- It's shit.</i>

16
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,629
Er... tampons, condoms -
pretty much anything that'll fit down a toilet.

17
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,032
And since you're the new boy...

18
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,759
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, all right.
I got it.

19
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,357
I swear to God, man...
if it wasn't for my little girl...

20
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,950
...I'd tell 'em to shove
the parole up their arse.

21
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,353
Mother... fucker!

22
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,795
What are you laughing at, man?

23
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,713
- I could catch the plague or something.
- You just might.

24
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,232
What was that?

25
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,708
- What was that?
- It's just echoes.

26
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,756
Echoes? From what?

27
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,953
The zoo?

28
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,877
Very funny.

29
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,229
So what did you get sent to prison for
in the first place?

30
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,316
What?

31
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,436
I said, what did you get sent down for.

32
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,549
A fucking travesty, that's what.

33
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,713
I mean, I get sent down for dealing weed
and that shit's legal now.

34
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,598
If I got busted now
for what I had on me then,

35
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,148
<i>they would have thrown it down the drain
and not me.</i>

36
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,119
Oh, you're a drug dealer.
The chap I had last week was a pimp.

37
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,310
- Now what?
- I don't know.

38
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,119
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know.

39
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,672
I haven't been down this tunnel for about a year,
but this wasn't here. I'd have reported it.

40
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,953
This is amazing.

41
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,871
Am I missing something here?

42
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,511
- I've got a new tunnel.
- So?

43
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,438
Well, so - I've been walking these tunnels
for 20 years and now I've got a new one.

44
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,638
Well, if that's what does it for you,
I'm scared.

45
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,517
Let's take a look.

46
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,319
<i>I ain't going down there!
That shit's too deep.</i>

47
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,794
- What's the matter with you?
- I can't swim.

48
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,678
And I don't share your interest
in pipes and tunnels.

49
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,194
All right. You... stay there.

50
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,312
Yeah. You go for it, Sherlock.

51
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,512
Arthur?

52
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,476
Are you OK, Arthur?

53
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,196
You better not be fucking with me.

54
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,194
Shit.

55
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,958
Arthur?

56
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,193
Oh, yeah.

57
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,430
OK, I get it, I get it.

58
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,592
Forgive me...

59
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,833
Arthur.

60
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,353
Arthur!

61
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,399
Arthur, mate.

62
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,674
Arthur.

63
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,313
What did you see?

64
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,956
# Madder

65
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,632
# This one day bam bam bam

66
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,756
# Bammer, bammer, bammer

67
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,796
# Don't make you feel like...

68
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,836
Have you seen Jemma?

69
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,672
# This one day bam bam bam...

70
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,596
Hey, Kate. How are you doing?

71
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,558
# Madder, madder, madder

72
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,232
# This one day bam, bam, bam

73
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,356
# Bammer, slammer, bammer

74
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,998
# This want to make you feel

75
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,638
# If I ever needed inspiration

76
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,836
# Right about here's where I lose my patience...

77
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,831
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi.

78
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,915
- Hey.
- Hey, boys.

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,355
- Have you seen Jemma?
- Yeah, yeah, I have.

80
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,036
She's in the back office.

81
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,350
Now, why did I have a feeling you would know?

82
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,000
Because you have a lot of feelings for me, Kate.

83
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,719
No, I have two. Pity and disgust.

84
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,598
I hope you remember that
when you're trying to score later.

85
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,671
What, I have to flirt with you to get a line?

86
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,432
Just a few compliments maybe.

87
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,910
- Guy, I'd rather sniff glue.
- Where are you going after this, Kate?

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,072
- Why, what are you doing?
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

89
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,199
Well, why don't you make a list of possibilities
so I know where to avoid?

90
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,875
- She'll be back.
- Yeah. Looks like you nailed that one, mate.

91
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,276
- Hey.
- That dress is amazing.

92
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,076
Where's the party and why aren't I invited?

93
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,357
- Jemma and I are on a secret mission tonight.
- Go on.

94
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,829
Two words. George Clooney.

95
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,831
What, he's in town?

96
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,229
Yep. And I know where he's hanging out tonight.

97
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,797
Are you gonna try to pull him?

98
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,077
Oh, my God, no. I'm just gonna ask
for his autograph! What do you think?

99
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,752
So, what are you gonna say?

100
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,030
<i>I don't know. I haven't got that far with the plan.</i>

101
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,795
<i>But, you know what? In the end, he's a man.
Men are simple creatures.</i>

102
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,312
Watch this. Guy.

103
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,676
See? So simple.

104
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,671
Karen, Kate's gonna shag George Clooney.

105
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

106
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,233
I know where he's hanging out tonight
and Jemma has tickets to the VIP lounge

107
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,154
<i>- and hopefully nature's gonna run its course.
- But Jemma's already left.</i>

108
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,834
- What are you talking about?
- I put her in a cab.

109
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,229
- Don't joke.
- I swear to God.

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,468
Kate, please - tell me you're still going.

111
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,233
Taxi!

112
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,838
Taxi!

113
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,032
Spare us some change, please.

114
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,756
This machine dispenses notes.

115
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,230
If you're looking for change,
why don't you hang round a phone box?

116
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,999
<i>.. on the Northern Line,
between Charing Cross and Golders Green</i>

117
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,959
<i>and between Euston and East Finchley
in both directions.</i>

118
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,470
It's exact money only. It's not giving change.
You'll have to go to the booth.

119
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,277
Er... do you have any change? I don't care
if it's the correct amount. I'm in a real rush.

120
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,113
No, I'm sorry. You'll have to go to the booth.

121
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,191
Are you enjoying this?

122
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,271
I just want to get to the machine.

123
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,193
- Excuse me, do you need a Travelcard?
- Yes, I do. How much?

124
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,510
<i>- £1.50.
- I'll give you 20.</i>

125
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,068
<i>- Are you serious?
- Absolutely. 100%.</i>

126
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,230
It's illegal to buy off tramps anyway.

127
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,833
Thanks very much.

128

# Ambient

129
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,078
Hello?

130
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,436
Hello? Hello?

131
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,995
Scheisse.

132
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,478
Hello?

133
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,238
Hello?

134
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,758
Hello?

135
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,878
Hello?

136
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,315
<i>Anybody in there?</i>

137
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,479
Hello?

138
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,668
Hello?

139
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,990
Excuse me. I fell asleep on the platform.

140
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,114
Don't you check them before you lock up?

141
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,839
Huh?

142
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,469
I mean, it's a little weird to me.
There's nobody in charge here?

143
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,794
Excuse me, do you mind answering me?
You're starting to freak me out.

144
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,832
Well, fine. My boyfriend's up the front.
I'll just go get him.

145
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,751
Kate, it's me. It's Guy.

146
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,796
Guy? You scared me to death.

147
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,235
<i>I'm sorry. I was just playing with you, that's all.</i>

148
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,914
Hang on - what are you doing here?

149
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,436
What do you mean, what am I doing here?
This is what you wanted.

150
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,669
What?

151
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,036
Come on. You wanted me to come tonight.

152
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,836
What are you talking about?

153
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,115
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

154
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,393
Guy, you're mentally ill, do you know that?

155
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,589
Freak.

156
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,830
- Kate, where are you going?
- Out of here.

157
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,273
Good luck.

158
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,635
Now, what's that supposed to mean?

159
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,393
I think we might be here till morning, that's all.

160
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,390
<i>No.</i>

161
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,870
- You might, we won't.
- You could always look on the bright side.

162
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,036
<i>How much of that have you had?</i>

163
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,076
Not much. There's plenty left.

164
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,068
Want some?

165
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,116
No, I don't.

166
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,076
Hello?

167
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,991
Did you kill the driver?

168
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,679
I don't think any knight in shining armour's
going to come and rescue you, Kate.

169
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,756
<i>Now, what say you take that dress off?</i>

170
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,440
<i>- What did you just say?
- Come on, you heard me</i>

171
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,315
Yeah, I did hear you but I'm going to forget what
you said because you're not thinking straight.

172
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,551
I am thinking straight.
It's you that's confused, Kate.

173
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,596
Whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

174
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,671
I'm just breaking the ice.

175
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,795
Come on. Admit that you want my dick.

176
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,396
You're joking, right?

177
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,436
<i>But you like it, don't you?</i>

178
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,156
I don't know what to say.

179
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,076
Er...

180
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,116
it's like a penis, just smaller.

181
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,954
- What are you...
- Don't fuck with me.

182
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,712
- What are you doing?
- Ssh.

183
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,356
- Get off me!
- You fucking bitch!

184
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,108
Stop it! Get off!

185
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,795
Guy!

186
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,997
<i>No! No! Arghh!</i>

187
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,476
<i>No!</i>

188
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,518
Guy?

189
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,673
Guy?

190
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,359
<i>Run.</i>

191
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,998
What?

192
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,996
Come on. No.

193
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,635
Hello! I'm trapped in here!

194
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,598
Hello!

195
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,598
Hello.

196
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,397
Oh.

197
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,551
I know you. Hi.

198
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,840
Oh, wait. Wait a second. Wait.

199
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,637
Wait.

200
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,589
Hello?

201
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,553
Hello?

202
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,599
Hello?

203
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,633
Hello?

204
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,154
- Who's there?
- Jimmy, what's going on? Who is it?

205
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,993
- Turn the fucking light on.
- I'm sorry. I'm stuck down here.

206
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,789
- Who is it, Jim?
- I gave you £20 for the Travelcard, remember?

207
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,630
Do you want your money back or something?

208
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,077
Oh, no, no, no. I'm stuck down here.
I got locked in. Someone's chasing me.

209
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,758
She's fucked. You'll not get any sense out of
her. You'll be lucky to get any sense out of me.

210
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,229
Look, someone's been attacked, OK?

211
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,279
- What are you going on about?
- I got stuck on a train with this guy from work.

212
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,316
And he was attacking me.

213
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,358
- What, the guy from work?
- Yeah. He went crazy and he...

214
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,309
He was... he was trying to rape me and then
the train doors opened and someone got him.

215
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,960
What do you mean they got him?

216
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,349
Pulled him off me! And... I don't know...

217
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,000
Hey, hey, all right, all right. What's your name?

218
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,836
<i>- Kate.
- Kate. All right, Kate.</i>

219
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,152
Well, look, I'm Jimmy, right?
My wee beautiful wee lady here - this is Mandy.

220
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,755
- Have you got a cigarette?
- Yeah, but...

221
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,469
No, no, nay buts, all right.
Let's just have a cigarette, all right.

222
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,509
- Have a seat.
- OK. I'll have a seat.

223
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,798
OK.

224
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,309
First off, you can't get out of here at night.

225
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,391
<i>- What?
- It's true.</i>

226
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,789
Once you're in, you're in. It's totally locked up.

227
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,028
But... isn't there a guard?

228
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,317
There's one in the control room,
but we're not messing with him.

229
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,551
- What do you mean? Why not?
- Cos he don't mess with us.

230
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,596
There's a maniac out there.

231
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,636
Nah, you don't know that.

232
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,633
It sounds to me like some vigilante train driver's
got a wee bit carried away.

233
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,757
The way I see it, you should be thanking him
not running away.

234
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,435
No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea.
You didn't see what he did to Guy.

235
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,999
The rapist?

236
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,036
You got a fag, Jim?

237
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,112
I'm telling you...
something is not right down here.

238
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,715
There's a lot of things not right down here,
sweetheart.

239
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,358
<i>Can I have a fag, Jim?</i>

240
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,996
You've got one in your fingers, babe.

241
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,873
Now, if you don't mind... I want
to get good and messy with my wee lady here.

242
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,793
<i>You're welcome to stay
if you'll not mind my habit.</i>

243
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,310
So er... you're just gonna do nothing?

244
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,596
Well, I wouldn't say that.

245
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,598
Here, move.

246
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,150
That's sleeping bag's not as damp as it looks.
You can sit there.

247
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,198
All right. OK. I'm gonna pay you, all right?

248
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,840
I'm gonna pay you
if you get me to the control room. OK?

249
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,990
I've told you, we're not messing with him.

250
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,599
How much?

251
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,432
Er...

252
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,314
Fifty pounds?

253
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,714
Well... er...

254
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,916
<i>You know...</i>

255
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,830
I guess rules are made to be broken, eh?

256
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,114
<i>Thank you.</i>

257
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,790
<i>Babe.</i>

258
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,039
Mandy.

259
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,756
Gonna go and help the wee lady here.

260
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,474
- Who?
- I'm gonna help our friend Kate, here.

261
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,516
I'm gonna take her to see the guard.

262
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,231
Do you fancy her?

263
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,038
No, I fancy you.

264
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,919
<i>So, what are you, French?
- No, I'm German.</i>

265
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,357
German. I support Germany
when they're playing against England at football.

266
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,436
Come to think of it, I support anyone
playing against England at football.

267
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,988
- How much further to the guard?
- It's quite a way yet.

268
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,798
This place is a rabbit warren.

269
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,873
Do you know, there's 400 miles of track
down here? Plus loads more that ain't in use.

270
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,518
Really?

271
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,112
Aye, really.

272
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,838
Jim?

273
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,150
I think I might know
what happened to your friend.

274
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,355
What?

275
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,829
A while back,
some homeless people went missing.

276
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,195
- What do you mean "missing"?
- Disappearing.

277
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,590
There were rumours that something was
creeping up on them and taking them.

278
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,998
Are you joking?

279
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,069
<i>Course I'm fucking joking. Homeless people
don't go missing. Homeless people are missing.</i>

280
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,918
Jim?

281
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,678
Jim?

282
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,515
Shit.

283
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,556
<i>Ray!</i>

284
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,631
Come here!

285
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,993
Ray, come here.

286
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,229
I've been trying to get me and Mandy in a hostel
cos the weather's getting cold.

287
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,993
But the housing man,
he's not been round for months.

288
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,834
But he cannae get in touch with me
on the phone cos I've not got a phone.

289
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,595
We were gonna stay at my mate Tommy's,
but he got busted, he got done for dealing.

290
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,911
OK, listen, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I really don't mean to be rude,

291
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,470
but... I don't care about your lifetime story
right now, OK?

292
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,438
We have to get to the security guard
as soon as possible.

293
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,158
You're a cheeky fucking bitch.

294
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,958
<i>- Do you know that?
Kate.</i>

295
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,432
Guy?

296
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,878
Oh, my God, it's Guy.

297
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,799
We're just gonna get help.
We'll be right back, OK?

298
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,036
What are you looking at me for?

299
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,553
I don't know.

300
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,871
- Can't we just get him off the rails?
- He tried to rape you.

301
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,710
<i>- Let him rot.
Please... help me.</i>

302
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,994
Fuck off.

303
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,075
OK, listen... listen.

304
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,191
Will another 50 do it, huh?

305
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,351
You're lucky she's a soft touch, you know.

306
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,989
If you tried to do that to my girl,
I'd cut your fucking balls off.

307
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,635
- Fucking hell.
- What is it?

308
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,710
All right, put your arms round my neck.

309
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,430
Fuck!

310
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,596
Jimmy, is that your dog?

311
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,839
Mandy.

312
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,513
Jimmy?

313
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,591
We should stay together!

314
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,834
Oh...

315
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,716
Guy.

316
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,518
Who did this to you?

317
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,190
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm sorry.

318
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,072
Mandy!

319
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,272
Mandy!

320
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,191
Where is she?

321
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,878
Mandy!

322
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,392
Mandy!

323
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,432
Fuck!

324
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,472
Guy, listen.

325
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,869
I'm gonna go and get Jimmy, OK?

326
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,317
And I'm gonna go and get the security guard
and then we'll get out of here, OK?

327
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,755
Just stay here. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

328
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,036
Just stay awake and you'll be fine.

329
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,992
Kate...

330
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,079
You'll be fine.

331
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,479
You will.

332
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,593
Come on.

333
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,638
# Chamber piece

334
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,552
Hello?

335
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,915
- Hello?
- Who is that?

336
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,956
Hello. Are you the security guard?

337
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,996
<i>I'm the security supervisor.</i>

338
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,311
<i>- Now, who are you?
- Um... well, I got locked in here and...</i>

339
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,713
Look, you have to help me. Somebody's
really badly hurt down here and... he's dying.

340
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,472
Are you part of the homeless crowd?

341
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,312
What? No, no.

342
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,072
Well, yes, but no.

343
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,515
<i>- Well, which is it?
- What difference does it make?</i>

344
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,749
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

345
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,876
<i>Where is this person? I don't see him.</i>

346
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,916
Where are you?

347
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,514
Is that you? Well, he's down here.

348
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,636
<i>Well, you'll have to put him into view.</i>

349
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,679
Are you kidding me?
Just call an ambulance for God's sake.

350
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,515
I'm not calling anyone until I've established
exactly what it is I'm dealing with here.

351
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,990
<i>For all I know there could be
a gang of crackheads down there with you.</i>

352
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,833
Do I look like a crackhead to you? Huh?

353
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,639
It's hard to tell. I'm watching you
on a black-and-white monitor in a long shot.

354
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,998
<i>Listen, just call a fucking ambulance.
The guy's bleeding to death.</i>

355
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,075
And as soon as you confirm that, I will.

356
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,912
<i>- Asshole.
- I heard that.</i>

357
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,956
Well, good.

358
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,956
I'm going to get him, OK?

359
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,032
OK, Guy. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to move you one more time.

360
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,712
You'll be fine, OK?

361
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,631
Guy? What are...

362
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,512
Guy?

363
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,912
Guy?

364
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,476
OK, OK, OK.

365
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,960
Into shot... where the fucker can see you.

366
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,234
<i>Look, asshole! Is this enough?</i>

367
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,268
<i>He's dead!</i>

368
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,996
<i>Now get me out of here!</i>

369
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,991
OK, er... wait there.

370
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,748
Get off!

371
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,796
Go on, get out.

372
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,313
Shoo! Get away.

373
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,949
Oh, shit.

374
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,638
Oh, fuck.

375
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,029
Jimmy.

376
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,556
Jimmy. Where's Mandy?

377
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,392
Did he get Mandy?

378
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,597
The security guard's killed and Guy's dead.

379
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,636
We have to leave right now.

380
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,352
Jimmy.

381
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,076
No. No!

382
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,910
Listen. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

383
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,916
I'll make it very simple for you, OK.

384
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,870
If... if I go through the next tunnel to the
next station, is there going to be another guard?

385
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,239
Huh?

386
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,276
Answer me, please.

387
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,196
Fuck you, I'll do it by myself.

388
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,070
<i>Are you finished?</i>

389
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,510
There's a torch over there.

390
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,556
<i>You'll need a pair of boots.</i>

391
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,474
Jimmy.

392
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,710
How far is it to the next station?

393
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,993
<i>Huh?</i>

394
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,556
Jimmy, how far is it?

395
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,109
<i>Er... don't know.</i>

396
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,836
What about the live track?

397
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,678
Er... you'll be all right
if you don't touch that one... that one...

398
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,996
W-wait. Which one?

399
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,798
Um...

400
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,111
- Don't touch any of them.
- Ah. OK.

401
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,438
Wait.

402
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,958
Wait.

403
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,676
I was gonna take her home.

404
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,514
I was gonna take her back to Scotland
and get her off the gear.

405
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,116
I was gonna let my mam look after her.

406
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,679
But I didn't.

407
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,556
What was that? Jimmy, what was that?

408
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,948
A train.

409
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,474
- Don't joke.
- Don't joke on railway lines.

410
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,756
Come on then. Shit!

411
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,877
It's stopping. It's stopping!

412
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,951
<i>- What if it's him?
- it'll just be a driver.</i>

413
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,349
- We don't know that, do we?
- What are you on about?

414
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,000
They drive all night.
They stop if someone's on the line.

415
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,470
Kate, are you not listening?
The driver's gonna get us out of here.

416
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,314
I'm not listening cos you're not thinking straight.
You're fucked out of your head.

417
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,597
We have to assume it's him.
Maybe you're right, but we have to assume.

418
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,319
<i>Look, there's a passageway back there. Let's go.</i>

419
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,878
Do you think whoever's driving the train
killed Mandy?

420
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,918
I don't know,
but I really don't want to stay and find out.

421
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,513
<i>- I think I do.
- No, come on.</i>

422
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,397
<i>Seriously. Come on!</i>

423
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,471
You don't understand. I wanna meet him.

424
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,472
Don't be stupid. Come with me.

425
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,438
Look, if it's the driver, I'll call for you, all right?

426
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,754
If it's not... I won't.

427
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,750
No, I'm not leaving you here.

428
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,115
It's exactly what you're gonna do.
Take Ray and go.

429
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,156
<i>Go!</i>

430
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,233
OK, OK.

431
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,393
Fine. OK.

432
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,152
<i>Here I am!</i>

433
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,316
Where are you, you fucker?

434
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,758
Come on, you fuck!

435
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,476
Come on!

436
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,516
Fucking come on!

437
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,271
Mate. Mate.

438
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,918
Jimmy.

439
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,194
Jimmy!

440
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,238
Argh.

441
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,358
Hello?

442
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,358
Argh!

443
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,957
Get that thing away from me.

444
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,193
I ain't dead.

445
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,990
I thought you was dead when he brought you in.

446
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,075
Look... are you injured?

447
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,516
No... I don't think so.

448
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,272
Well, check yourself.

449
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,836
I think I'm all right.

450
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,716
What is this place?

451
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,556
The sewage system.

452
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,878
What's your name?

453
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,678
George.

454
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,277
George. Really?

455
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,716
What's so funny?

456
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,509
I... I was supposed to meet a George tonight.

457
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,839
This is not quite what I had in mind.

458
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,796
What was that?

459
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,516
<i>- Huh?
- Ignore it.</i>

460
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,751
What do you mean "ignore it"?
Has the girl been here? Huh?

461
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,796
<i>I don't know.</i>

462
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,639
<i>- Oh, God!
- What? What?</i>

463
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,156
There's something in here.
Something just touched my leg.

464
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,196
- What is it?
- Dunno.

465
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,230
It's just some blockage from the pipe.

466
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,716
How did it get in your cage?

467
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,756
How should I know?

468
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,035
Maybe it... floated underneath.

469
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,949
So?

470
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,157
Maybe the bars in between the cages
don't touch the floor.

471
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,199
So?

472
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,511
So maybe we can swim underneath...

473
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,594
...pull ourselves out... and get out.

474
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,634
You see, over there... there's an open cage.

475
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,511
Swim through, haul yourself out,
then open mine.

476
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,108
I can't.

477
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,149
Why?

478
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,754
- I can't swim.
- You don't need to swim.

479
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,832
- Just pull yourself under, OK?
- I can't do that either.

480
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,514
- Are you kidding?
- I can't hold my breath underwater.

481
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,033
Listen... you better learn now

482
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,193
cos if you don't, the only way
you're going to get out is if he pulls you out.

483
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,233
Sorry. This ain't no time for swimming lessons,
all right, lady?

484
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,636
Just one more cage. Go on.

485
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,956
Arghhh!

486
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,359
Argh!

487
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,717
Argh!

488
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,912
Come on, come on.

489
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,871
Come on.

490
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,916
Come on, come on.

491
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,518
Here, take this.

492
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,792
What is this place?

493
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,037
<i>Oh, no.</i>

494
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,916
<i>That's Mandy.</i>

495
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,517
- You know her?
- Yeah.

496
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,636
- Do you think she's alive?
- What?

497
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,676
- Could you...
- No.

498
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,955
<i>Can you please check if she's breathing?</i>

499
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,309
- Look at her.
- Please. Please check.

500
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,516
Are you OK?

501
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,396
She's dead.

502
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,278
Come on, come on, come on.

503
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,836
Ssh, ssh.

504
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,956
- It's my fault!
- Listen, listen...

505
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,511
- I paid Jimmy to come with me.
- We've got to think about getting out of here.

506
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,478
He would have protected her.
She would not be dead.

507
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,516
Listen, I've got a daughter.

508
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,236
And I really wanna see her again.

509
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,998
All right? Ssh.

510
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,234
Listen... we're gonna get out.

511
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,232
<i>OK?</i>

512
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,231
<i>Yeah? Come on.</i>

513
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,396
Please.

514
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,836
Hang on. Give me the torch.

515
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,993
There's a tunnel behind this wall.

516
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,669
The bricks are loose. Give me a hand.

517
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,716
Fuck the bricks. Move, move, move.

518
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,116
Yeah.

519
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,309
OK, OK.
