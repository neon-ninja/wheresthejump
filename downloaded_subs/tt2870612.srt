Everything. That it's

that could turn base metals into gold

Sort of crude representation,
but basically

116
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:18,366
the creation of the stone
was the goal of alchemy

which was an early form of science which
studied transformation in all its forms.

preeminent historian in alchemy.

speculation that he was mentally unstable.

121

Why? Because he killed himself?

Six hundred years ago the greatest
of the alchemists, Nicolas Flamel

123

lived here, in this house in Paris.

124
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:53,468
He was widely believed to have succeeded
in developing the philosopher's stone

125
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:58,740
which would have given him all the wealth
he could dream of as well as eternal life.

hands on the philosopher's stone

127
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:07,015
tried to dig his body up out of the cemetery
that used to surround this area here

128
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:10,449
they found his casket empty,
as well as his wife's.

129
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:17,091
Okay. So this is Nicolas Flamel's tombstone
which he designed and carved himself.

130
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:20,428
And my father believed that the clues to
the location of the philosopher's stone

131
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:24,566
were encoded somehow
in these arcane symbols.

132

That isn't actually the right way.

505
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:44,938
This one here. This is a
much more direct route.

506
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:47,507
- Sometimes the wrong direction is better.
- No.

507
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:49,676
- Nobody uses this corridor.
- Why not?

508
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:51,778
It's a bad place.

509
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:55,282
What do you mean, it's a bad place?
Is it dangerous or...

510
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:59,719
Bad like, people who go in
this tunnel don't come out.

511
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,923
We're talking about some kind
of urban legend or something.

512
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:04,891
This could save us hours upon hours.

513
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:07,294
You think because you see
something in a book, you know it?

514
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:11,298
- Just look at the map, here.
- Okay, this? This is not the catacombs.

515
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:16,136
This will not tell you anything. Tell me,
which ones are filled with water?

516
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:19,306
Which ones have collapsed?
Which ones are evil?

517
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,808
- You don't need to be yelling.
- You don't know!

518
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:26,110
We had a friend named La Taupe.
In English, <i>"la taupe" c'est</i> "the mole."

519
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,582
He lived down here for years.

520
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:32,919
He knew every corridor of
every system, except this one.

521
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,423
He knew there was something
horrible down there.

522
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:39,392
But eventually, he had
to see what it was.

523
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:41,828
He went inside and nobody
has seen him since.

524
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:46,099
So if you want to take this way,
go ahead. Not with me.

525
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,032
Or me.

526
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:50,935
It's the best way.

527

here before. We haven't.

528

then it's been down here for 600 years.

- Yeah.

840
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,914
- What do you see?
- Oh, my God!

841
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:19,685
- Oh, my God!
- What?

842
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:22,619
George, you have to see this!
Oh, my God!

843
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:29,292
BENJI: Wow.

844
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:34,898
GEORGE: What is this place?

845
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:38,404
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

846
00:50:38,504 --> 00:50:41,306
He's dead, but how is he not rotting?

847
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:43,142
I have no idea. George, look at this.

848
00:50:43,242 --> 00:50:45,242
- What is that?
- "VITRIOL."

849
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:49,481
- Why VITRIOL?
- It's the motto of alchemy.

850
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:50,582
VITRIOL?

851

853
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:01,566
- find the hidden stone.
- The hidden stone.

854
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,395
- Fuck!
- PAPILLON: Is he dead?

855
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:06,598
- GEORGE: Yeah. For 700 years.
- SCARLETT: Oh, my God!

856
00:51:06,698 --> 00:51:08,265
It's creepy.

857
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:11,935
Wait. Visit the interior
parts of the Earth.

858
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:15,274
He's telling us to go deeper.

859
00:51:15,374 --> 00:51:17,242
- I think it means we're here.
- No.

860
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:19,078
This has got to be the
interior parts of the Earth.

861
00:51:19,178 --> 00:51:22,381
No, there has got to be more.
"Winged vulture leads your way,

Brightest light in darkest day.

863
00:51:28,387 --> 00:51:31,123
- Everyone turn off your headlamps.
- BENJI: Nah, fuck that.

864
00:51:31,223 --> 00:51:33,292
- Benji, it will be okay.
- There is a dead man right there.

865
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:34,958
It will be okay.

866
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:37,196
Everyone.

- Scarlett?
- Holy shit.

- Look!
- BENJI: Yeah.

00:51:42,634 --> 00:51:45,304
Where's this light coming
from if that's a wall?

light on. Please.

873
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:55,080
I reckon we can get through there.

874
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,249
- Scarlett, what are you doing?
- There's a loose stone.

875
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:03,753
Okay.

876
00:52:05,057 --> 00:52:07,257

Can you see anything down there?

- ZED: Is something in there?

878
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:18,902

- Zed.
- What?

00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,374
Give me my bag.

00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:14,924
It's real.

Scarlett, how are these torches still lit?

"Brightest light in darkest day."
Think about it.

- Brightest light.
- Yeah.

899
00:54:06,845 --> 00:54:08,113
The Sun.

900
00:54:08,213 --> 00:54:11,783
In ancient Egypt,
they said that the Earth god

901
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:15,454
and the sky goddess
were madly in love.

902
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:18,123
But when they had their
first child, the Sun,

903
00:54:18,223 --> 00:54:21,526
he became so jealous of their
affections that he pushed them apart

904
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:26,898
so that they were only able to
touch by the palms of their hands

905
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:29,067
and the soles of their feet.

906
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:34,306
Every morning, the sky goddess
gave birth to the Sun,

907
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:36,506
and every evening

908
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:40,646
- she would swallow him back up.
- That's it!

909
00:54:40,746 --> 00:54:43,513
Oh, my God. It looks so ordinary.

00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,166

964
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,435
They'd never build something
like this without a back door,

- in case it collapsed, right?
- Never.

Here.

976

This is "As above, so below."

977
00:58:34,379 --> 00:58:37,983
That phrase is believed
to be the key to all magic.

978
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,716
It means that...

979
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:43,889
what is within me is outside of me.

980
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:49,160
As it is on Earth, so it is in heaven.
As I am, so are my cells,

981
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,664
so are my atoms, so is God.

982
00:58:52,764 --> 00:58:54,933
Basically,

983
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:58,534
as I believe the world
to be, so it is.

As above, so below.

986
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:07,212
So if they carved a
door on the ceiling...

987
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:09,014
There has got to be a
door on the floor, too.

988
00:59:09,114 --> 00:59:11,216
- Yeah. Someone hand me a rock.
- All right.

989
00:59:11,316 --> 00:59:14,219
Wait. We are in the
bottom of the catacombs.

990
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,252
There's nothing below us, Scarlett.

991
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:19,255
Shit.

992
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,861
If this is the floor then where
is all that water going?

993
00:59:30,268 --> 00:59:31,667
There's a way out.

994
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:44,981
- SOUXIE: Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

995
00:59:47,352 --> 00:59:49,254
Guys, there's a passage down here.

996
00:59:49,354 --> 00:59:52,688
- Come down. It's okay.
- Souxie.

997
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:57,226
Watch out, Benji.

998
00:59:58,363 --> 01:00:01,931
Can you read that? What does it say?

999
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:12,241
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here."

1000
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,478
PAPILLON: What?

1001
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:24,353
According to mythology, that's the
inscription over the gates of Hell.

1002
01:00:25,223 --> 01:00:26,389
PAPILLON: What?

1003
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:30,061
I'm not going in there.

1004
01:00:30,161 --> 01:00:32,895
I thought you didn't
believe in any of this.

1005
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:35,765
I don't.

1006
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,810
"And they shall be made to crawl on their
bellies to enter the kingdom of darkness."

1007
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,246
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

1008
01:00:48,346 --> 01:00:49,612
Yeah.

1009
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:52,915
Shit.

1010
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,599
