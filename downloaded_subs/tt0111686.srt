1
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,131
More blood!

2
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:15,211
Great. Keep coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.

3
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:17,251
Don't be stingy.

4
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,291
Watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.

5
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:21,011
Chase, keep that claw
really moving.

6
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:22,971
Jeffrey, jam it on there
just like Freddy would.

7
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,771
Good, good. And cut!
Print that, Gretchen.

8
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,571
Chase, you're a genius.

9
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,891
This makes his old claw look
like Mother Teresa's mitten.

10
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,171
You better thank them.
They're very sensitive.

11
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,091
Chuck, Terry, great blood.

12
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,971
- Thank you very much.
- Some of our best work.

13
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,771
Hey, monkey man,
want to see some neat stuff?

14
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,491
Come on.

15
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:46,811
It's only make-Believe.

16
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,931
Marianne, I gotta go.

17
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,331
Low bridge.

18
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:02,051
Let's see if we can
scare the P.J.'S off Mommy.

19
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,131
Hey, Heather.

20
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:15,931
You hungry, Dylan?

21
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,691
Gotcha.

22
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,091
It should have flexed more.

23
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,691
I think the servos
got shorted out with blood.

24
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:31,771
Well, take it apart,
pull it out...

25
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,571
and insulate them
with some styro.

26
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,531
The thing wasn't meant to be
submerged, for Pete's sake.

27
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,651
I don't like that thing.

28
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:40,251
That thing puts bread
on our table.

29
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,211
Is it alive, Daddy?

30
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,971
Heather,
you're in the next shot.

31
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,091
State-Of-The-Art animatronics
with bio-Organic grafting.

32
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,211
Bull tendons, nerve bundles
from a live Doberman.

33
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,851
Must've have picked up a signal
from an eighties walkie-talkie.

34
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,731
- Sure it's off?
- It's off.

35
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,971
Funny, it's warm...
just like a real hand.

36
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,291
Oh, God.

37
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,771
What the hell's going on here?
Cut the effects!

38
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:35,811
Terry, where is it? Terry!

39
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,451
Chuck, get off me!

40
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,811
Heather, where is it?

41
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,571
Chase, where the hell is it?

42
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:47,411
Come on.

43
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,531
What the fuck?!

44
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,571
Earthquake. Come on.

45
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,411
Mommy!

46
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,011
What is that?

47
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,651
Car alarms.

48
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:56,931
You OK?

49
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,291
You OK, chief?

50
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,531
Honey, do you have a fever?

51
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:05,971
Just another earthquake, Dylan.

52
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:07,611
Getting kind of fun, huh?

53
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:09,971
Daddy. Blood.

54
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,211
It's nothing, guys.

55
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:14,971
It's a scratch. Really.

56
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:16,571
Where did you get that?

57
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,971
I don't know. Picture, I guess.

58
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,371
When it fell. It's no big deal.

59
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,411
Put a bandage on it.

60
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,811
Don't worry about it.

61
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:34,091
Geologists at Cal Tech...

62
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:36,451
have confirmed
this morning's aftershock...

63
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:37,931
Do we have to watch that?

64
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,371
...five-point-three
on the Richter scale.

65
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,491
Thought you turned it on.

66
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,331
It was strong enough
to cause further collapse...

67
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:44,691
of the already badly damaged
parking structure...

68
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,411
I'll turn it off.

69
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,811
Officials say
that this is normal...

70
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,051
following a quake
of last week's magnitude...

71
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:53,771
now thought to be a massive 6.8.

72
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:58,571
Dylan, this is breakfast,
not arts and crafts.

73
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,611
What?

74
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,571
Did you get any sleep
last night?

75
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,851
More or less.

76
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:08,771
OK, time to get dressed.
I'm late.

77
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,531
You going away?

78
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:12,811
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.

79
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:21,771
Is there anything other than
the obvious bothering you?

80
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,291
I think five earthquakes
in three weeks is enough.

81
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,011
Hasn't been another phone call,
has there?

82
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,491
Good sign.

83
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:35,771
Two full weeks without him.
Maybe he got hit by a truck.

84
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,411
He's closer, if anything.

85
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,851
It's giving me nightmares,
Chase.

86
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:43,331
Did you have one last night?

87
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:47,291
It's just the earthquakes,
Heather.

88
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,771
Maybe.

89
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,931
Maybe I shouldn't do
this interview today.

90
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:56,971
No. You gotta get back
on the horse sometime.

91
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:00,251
Look, you had a nut case
making harassing phone calls.

92
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,691
I know how scary that's been.

93
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:03,571
No, you don't.

94
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:08,091
OK, I don't.

95
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,491
But it doesn't mean
that it can't be over.

96
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,171
But what if it isn't over?

97
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,251
Maybe you should
tell me your dream.

98
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,011
It was nothing. I was...

99
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,571
you and I were working on
this movie, together for once...

100
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:28,091
and one of your special effects
went really wrong.

101
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:32,411
And Chuck and Terry got hurt...

102
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:33,571
and...

103
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:36,691
well, your fingers were cut.

104
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,091
Right here?

105
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:44,451
Heather, you were
probably half awake...

106
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,491
and saw my fingers get nicked
when the mirror fell.

107
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,131
Dreams are like that.

108
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:55,971
Look, if you don't want me
to go on this job, I won't.

109
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,931
Just be careful, OK?

110
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,611
I think I can survive
two days in Palm Springs...

111
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,491
supplying soap bubbles
for a detergent commercial.

112
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,611
I guess so.

113
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:07,851
You guess so?

114
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:09,771
Come here.

115
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:20,691
Forty-eight hours.

116
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,731
I'll be back in no time.

117
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:25,971
I gotta go.

118
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,491
I love what you've done
with the place.

119
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,051
Knock 'em dead.

120
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:44,731
Dylan, I gotta go.
Take care of Mommy.

121
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,771
Nancy.

122
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,331
Dylan, I don't want you
watching this.

123
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:25,091
Dylan, what's wrong?
What's wrong?!

124
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,531
What's happening to you?

125
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,771
One, two...

126
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,251
Freddy's coming for you!

127
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:14,451
Someone's coming.

128
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:15,571
What?

129
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,011
Are you OK, honey?

130
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,491
Is everything OK?

131
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,411
It's just these quakes.
Did you feel one just now?

132
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,211
No. A big truck went by
before you opened the door.

133
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:58,971
It's life on the fault line.

134
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:00,931
- Hey, tiger.
- Hi, Julie.

135
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:05,371
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning.

136
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,491
No, he seems OK.

137
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:11,571
Are you sure
that's all that's wrong?

138
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,691
Leave us alone,
you son of a bitch!

139
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:18,411
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.

140
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,571
Just wanted you to know
I'm out front.

141
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,931
I'm sorry.
Can you hang on a minute?

142
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:41,411
What is it?

143
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:42,571
I don't know.

144
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:46,011
I just have
this weird feeling today.

145
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,131
Mommy? Stay home, then.

146
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:57,211
This damn caller.

147
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,051
He's started again?

148
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:04,371
Sick fuck.

149
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,531
Sorry.

150
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,331
Dylan doesn't seem
to have a fever.

151
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:13,691
It's probably just your nerves.

152
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,251
Nerves?

153
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:19,171
I just meant from the shaker
this morning.

154
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,411
Everybody's freaked out about
how many we've been having.

155
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,011
And then these phone calls.

156
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:28,931
Don't answer it.

157
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,891
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we are going to be late.

158
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,491
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?

159
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,771
Bye.

160
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,411
I'll call the cops for you.

161
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,651
You've got the number
on the fridge, right?

162
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,291
Give them
the time they called...

163
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:18,771
and they're keeping this list,
supposedly.

164
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,371
Julie, I'm really sorry.

165
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,331
My nerves are
a little raw these days.

166
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:24,491
It's OK.

167
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:32,771
Yeah. I gotta go.

168
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,771
- Morning.
- Good morning.

169
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,731
You played that girl.

170
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:54,211
In that movie.

171
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,691
With the guy with the...

172
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,731
Yeah, sure. That's you.

173
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:01,891
That's what I love
about this job.

174
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,491
I get to meet the stars.

175
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,571
I'm hardly a star.

176
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,291
What, are you kidding?

177
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,331
I love your stuff.

178
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,931
The first was the best.

179
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:15,491
Where the girlfriend's cut open
and dragged across the ceiling.

180
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:16,611
It was awesome.

181
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,451
And when all that blood comes
out of your boyfriend's bed?

182
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:22,211
I thought I'd shit.

183
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:24,771
But they never should
have killed off Freddy.

184
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,451
Heather, look, we gotta go.

185
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:30,851
Cutting it close, aren't you?
You trying to get me fired?

186
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,331
OK! We're coming!

187
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:37,931
So, Heather, we're approaching
the tenth anniversary...

188
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,531
of this whole
"Nightmare on Elm Street" thing.

189
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:42,891
I mean, the original,
five very popular sequels.

190
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:46,811
How has all the success
affected you personally?

191
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,371
I don't know
if it really has, Sam.

192
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,531
God. With the exception
of One and Three...

193
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:54,331
I pretty much stayed out of it.

194
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:56,371
Well, I'm doing a lot more
television now...

195
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:58,211
so those hours
let me spend a lot more time...

196
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,491
with my husband
and my little boy.

197
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:01,731
You have a little boy.
What's his name?

198
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:03,971
Dylan.

199
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:06,611
With Dylan,
does that change your feeling...

200
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,771
your perspective
about horror movies?

201
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,451
No, not really.

202
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:12,331
Would you let him
see one of your movies?

203
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:14,371
My son? No.

204
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,691
I'm sure people ask you this
all the time...

205
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:19,011
Is there going
to be another sequel...

206
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:22,571
and what's more,
is Freddy really dead?

207
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:25,211
Of course he is.
Freddy's dead and gone.

208
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:28,771
And how about your co-Star
in the original...

209
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,091
would you trust him
alone with Dylan?

210
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,731
Robert? I don't know.

211
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,851
Why don't we ask him
how he'd feel about it?

212
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:39,211
We've got a big surprise for you
and for our audience.

213
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,211
Let's bring him out.
He is the best of the bad.

214
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:44,131
Let's say hello
to Robert Englund.

215
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,491
Love ya, babe!

216
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:57,011
We'll do lunch!

217
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:03,491
I'm alive once again!

218
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:07,571
Freddy's back! Give it up
for your Uncle Freddy!

219
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:12,091
Just when you thought it was
safe to get back into bed!

220
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:16,691
Give me five!

221
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:24,611
I'm back,
and I'm badder than ever!

222
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:31,931
You are all my children now!

223
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,491
I got to go, Robert.

224
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:42,051
Just a second. I'll walk you.

225
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,531
There you go, kids.

226
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:45,131
- Thank you.
- Bye-Bye.

227
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:48,411
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

228
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,891
Well, everything went great,
I thought.

229
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,611
We really got you, didn't we?

230
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,531
I don't know why
you didn't tell me.

231
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,731
Come on. They loved
the expression on your face.

232
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,171
I think they'd like
to see us together again.

233
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,211
In what, a romantic comedy?

234
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:02,651
Just because
it's a love story...

235
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,571
doesn't mean you can't
have a decapitation or two.

236
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,491
- There's a call for you.
- For me?

237
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,971
I'll talk to you later.

238
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:15,891
Heather, it's Sara Risher
over at New Line Cinema.

239
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,211
How are you?

240
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,851
How are you?
This is a voice from the past.

241
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:20,971
It sure is.

242
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:23,091
Listen, Heather,
I won't take but a minute.

243
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,451
It's just that we have
something to propose to you...

244
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,491
and I wonder
if you'd stop by the offices.

245
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,371
Bob would love to talk to you.

246
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,531
Sure. When?

247
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,131
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.

248
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:34,851
- Now?
-Just take a minute.

249
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,371
You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Bye.

250
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,571
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Bob Shaye.

251
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,171
Was Bob expecting you?

252
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:08,051
Sara. How are you?

253
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,371
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Great to see you.

254
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,291
- You look great.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:15,331
Bob is dying to see you.
Can I get you something?

256
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,011
- Coffee would be fine.
- Black?

257
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:19,011
- Black's fine.
- Could you get us some coffee?

258
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,331
- Sure.
- Thanks.

259
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,731
I think the guy
is a little bit of a jerk...

260
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,931
but we won't know
until we've read the script.

261
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,931
Anyhow, I'll give you a call
when I...

262
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,891
Listen, man, I got to go.

263
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,051
Call me
when you get to Milan...

264
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,211
and don't forget...
risotto con tartufi.

265
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,331
It's fantastico!

266
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,571
Take care, man.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

267
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,491
Boy, do you look great, Heather.

268
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,651
- How are you?
- Great. I'm fine.

269
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,651
And I don't have to ask
how you're doing.

270
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,411
Well, so far so good.

271
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:49,131
Which is why we asked you
to come by today.

272
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,331
- Thanks, Kim.
- Sure.

273
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,691
Look, Heather,
let me cut to the chase.

274
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,651
How would you like to join us
in the definitive "Nightmare"?

275
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,771
I thought you killed Freddy off.

276
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,731
Well, we did, but the fans...

277
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,611
God bless them,
they're clamouring for more.

278
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,851
I guess evil never dies, right?

279
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,811
Anyhow, a few weeks ago,
I got a call from Wes...

280
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,851
and he pitched me
this really ex citing idea...

281
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,171
and I started thinking...

282
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,011
"who better to resurrect
Freddy than his creator?"

283
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:21,691
I thought Wes stopped
doing horror movies.

284
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,971
He actually told me he hadn't
called in the last ten years...

285
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:28,251
because he hadn't had
any really scary nightmares.

286
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:30,931
They're his inspiration
for this thing.

287
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:34,051
Anyhow, he's right
in the middle of the script.

288
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,451
Which means
he's having nightmares again.

289
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,211
He's very excited about it.

290
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,371
- The nightmares?
- No, the script.

291
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:44,971
And you should be, too,
because you're the star.

292
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:48,371
I don't know, Bob.

293
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:52,411
I'm flattered, really,
but I have a kid now.

294
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:53,771
Well, so?

295
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:56,851
So I'm not sure
about doing horror.

296
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:58,971
Come on, Heather.
Kids love horror.

297
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,611
Thank you so much, Bob.

298
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,771
I have other things happening.

299
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:09,211
Look, we'll match any offer
that's on the table for you.

300
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,811
No, it's not that.
Look, I have a fan.

301
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:13,531
Heather, you got plenty of fans.

302
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,211
We've been doing
marketing research on you.

303
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:17,371
You are rating right up there.

304
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,931
We've got Chase working on
a prototype for the new glove.

305
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,051
What?

306
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:24,531
We asked him to kind of
keep it as a surprise...

307
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:27,091
until you and I could have
this conversation.

308
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,211
How long has Wes been
working on this script?

309
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:36,331
I don't know.
A couple of months. Why?

310
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,851
And since you've been
thinking of making it...

311
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,411
has anything funny happened?

312
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:41,611
What do you mean?

313
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:44,211
Like weird phone calls.

314
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,691
Or nightmares.

315
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,811
Why don't you answer
your phone, Bob?

316
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:59,531
That's what we got people
we pay around here for.

317
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,451
Will someone pick up
the damn phone?

318
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:18,731
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

319
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:34,611
What the...

320
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:45,291
Never sleep again.

321
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:54,091
What is going on?

322
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:56,331
You didn't let him watch
the movie on TV, did you?

323
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:59,931
Movie? He didn't watch
anything on TV.

324
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:02,451
He was taking his nap,
and I heard him screaming.

325
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,411
Honey, are you OK?

326
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:10,171
Rex saved me.

327
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,211
He did?

328
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:25,531
Is Rex going to die?

329
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,451
Rex is not going to die.

330
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,851
I promise you, sweetie.

331
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:37,331
Do you know where the sewing
stuff is in the kitchen?

332
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,051
Sure.

333
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:40,851
We'll do an operation, OK?

334
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:45,011
Come on.
Dr Dylan and Dr Julie.

335
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:47,251
Fix him up good as new, OK?

336
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:00,331
Hey, Chase. You've got a call.
It's your wife.

337
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:10,091
Chase, you better come home.

338
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:12,291
Heather, I'm stuck here.

339
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:14,531
Neither Chuck or Terry
came in today.

340
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,331
Why? What's the matter?

341
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:19,171
- Chase, it's Dylan.
- What?

342
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,931
Hold on.
The phone's breaking up.

343
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:27,971
What's going on with Dylan?

344
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:31,651
He's had some sort
of an episode.

345
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,211
What?

346
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,851
What kind of episode?

347
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:37,251
He was just acting
very strangely.

348
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,651
Like somebody was after him.

349
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:42,971
It's scary. It scared me.

350
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:46,171
He was acting like...

351
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,251
Like what?

352
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:49,891
Like Freddy.

353
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:54,651
Heather, has there been
another phone call?

354
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:59,851
Why didn't you tell me
you were working on a new glove?

355
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,131
And why aren't Chuck and Terry
at work today?

356
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,331
Forget those clowns. Answer me.

357
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,331
Has there been another
phone call today or not?

358
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:17,211
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.

359
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:22,251
- Danny, I got to go.
- What's up?

360
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,371
My kid's sick. I got to fly.

361
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:43,331
"As soon as the sun was up...

362
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:46,171
"the witch made Gretel fetch
the wood and kindle a fire.

363
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,011
"'We will bake cookies first,'
she said.

364
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,371
"'I've heated the oven
and kneaded the dough.

365
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,411
"'Crawl in and see if the fire
is blazing high enough now.'

366
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,531
"And she pushed Gretel
toward the oven.

367
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:58,731
"The witch went to shut the door
and bake her inside."

368
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:00,331
This is so violent.

369
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:03,971
I don't know why you like
these stupid old fairy tales.

370
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:05,491
Finish, please.

371
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:08,731
- They'll give you nightmares.
- I like this story.

372
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:14,451
"But Gretel guessed what
the witch was planning.

373
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,171
"'I don't know how to
get in,' Gretel said.

374
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,731
"'How am I to manage it?'

375
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,891
"'Stupid girl,' shouted
the witch, rushing to the oven.

376
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:24,131
"'The opening is big enough.
See? I can fit myself. '

377
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:27,331
"Quickly, Gretel came behind
and pushed with all her might...

378
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:30,091
"plunging the wicked old woman
headlong into the flames...

379
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:32,211
"banging the door shut
and bolting it tight.

380
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:35,371
"The witch howled..."
That's enough.

381
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:38,931
"The witch howled
like a scalded cat...

382
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,931
"but Gretel ran and left her
there to perish nonetheless.

383
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:43,691
"She ran to her brother
as fast as she could...

384
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,931
"flung open the door.
'Hansel! Hansel,' she cried.

385
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:48,491
"We're saved!
The witch is dead."

386
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,251
Time for sleep.

387
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:55,971
Say how they find
their way back home.

388
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:59,611
- Tomorrow night.
- No. Tonight.

389
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:01,531
It's important.

390
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:07,251
Dylan, you know as well as I do.

391
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:09,771
They followed the trail of
breadcrumbs back to their house.

392
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,651
And then their father
covered them with kisses...

393
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:12,891
and they were safe.

394
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:15,731
They were safe,
and they could sleep.

395
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:22,011
- What is that?
- Rex.

396
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,371
Come on.

397
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:34,811
Rex keeps him down there.

398
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,131
Who?

399
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:40,451
The mean old man with the claws.

400
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,331
He wants to come up
while we sleep.

401
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:44,691
I keep my feet up here.

402
00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:48,331
Rex keeps him down there.

403
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:51,771
He's my guard.

404
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:57,091
You should have a guard, too.

405
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,731
There's nothing down there.

406
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:04,091
Come here.

407
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:07,731
Look. See?

408
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:14,971
It's different when you're gone.

409
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,371
Come on.

410
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:30,811
On, please.

411
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:32,971
OK, sweetie.

412
00:27:36,371 --> 00:27:38,731
Night-Night. Sleep tight.

413
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,891
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

414
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:46,371
- Daddy coming home?
- He's on his way.

415
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:48,811
He can follow
the breadcrumbs, right?

416
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,211
Right.

417
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:59,371
If the birds
don't eat them first.

418
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:36,451
Perfect, perfect, perfect!

419
00:28:59,331 --> 00:29:01,851
Come on, come on, come on.

420
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:06,611
That's me in the corner

421
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,451
That's me in the spot

422
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:13,971
Light

423
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:15,171
Light

424
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:18,811
Losin' my

425
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,171
Religion

426
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:46,531
Mommy's scared?

427
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,891
Dylan, Mommy's fine.

428
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:54,411
It was just a bad dream.

429
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:56,451
What are you doing out of bed?

430
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:59,571
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting.

431
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:02,091
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.

432
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,851
I'm not sleepy.

433
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,171
Police, ma'am.
Will you open the door?

434
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,931
Heather Langenkamp?

435
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,611
Is Chase Porter your husband?

436
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,291
There was an accident.

437
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:48,571
It appears he fell asleep
while driving, ma'am.

438
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:52,251
Is he... I mean...

439
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:54,371
Is he hurt?

440
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:58,091
I'm afraid
it's worse than that, ma'am.

441
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:08,611
Is he dead?

442
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:10,771
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,731
Are you sure it's him?

444
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:21,051
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.

445
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:24,371
I want to see his body.

446
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,851
No, you don't, ma'am.
It's not necessary.

447
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,811
I want to see it for myself.

448
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,931
- Can you hand me that?
- Sure.

449
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,011
Excuse me.

450
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:22,131
- Could I help you?
- Porter.

451
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:24,931
Chase Porter.

452
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:32,091
It's back here.

453
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,371
You said Chase?

454
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:50,371
I'm sorry.

455
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:02,651
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.

456
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:06,531
I'd like to see once again.

457
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,851
I'm sorry?

458
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:10,891
Could you lift
the sheet again, please?

459
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:23,771
More, please.

460
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,611
What is that?

461
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:30,531
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.

462
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:33,651
The head's gonna be all right
for the funeral, but...

463
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:41,171
Hey, lady. You OK?

464
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:43,531
You sure?

465
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,771
Oh, God. What did that?

466
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:55,651
They said the truck
was tore up something awful...

467
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:58,651
so you can imagine him
not being in...

468
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,771
well, exactly top shape.

469
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:05,131
It looks like he was clawed.

470
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:12,811
That's why we don't lift
the sheet past the face, ma'am.

471
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:17,691
Sometimes it's what we don't see
that gets us through the night.

472
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:27,371
So, if you'll just sign...

473
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,211
God is our hope and strength...

474
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:40,931
a very present help in trouble.

475
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:43,531
Therefore, we will not fear...

476
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:45,531
though the earth be moved...

477
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:47,611
and though the hills
be carried...

478
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:50,571
into the midst of the sea...

479
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:54,131
though the waters thereof
rage and swell...

480
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,931
and though
the mountains shake...

481
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:59,051
at the tempest of the same.

482
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:36,451
-Julie, where's Dylan?
- I don't know.

483
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:54,491
Dylan, grab Mommy's hand.
Grab it!

484
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,651
Oh, my God!

485
00:35:57,651 --> 00:35:59,051
Hurry!

486
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:08,371
Let go of me!

487
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:09,731
Stay with me.

488
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:12,931
Stay with me, Heather.

489
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:19,491
- Where's Dylan?
- He's all right.

490
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:20,971
He's right here.

491
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:27,091
- What happened?
- Earthquake.

492
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,091
You got knocked off your feet.

493
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:31,771
You got a pretty good bump,
actually.

494
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:34,251
May he rest in peace, children.

495
00:36:34,371 --> 00:36:37,571
And may you all get home safely.

496
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:39,251
Amen.

497
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:57,611
If there's anything
I can do, Heather... anything.

498
00:36:57,731 --> 00:36:59,491
Thank you, Robert.

499
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,171
Sweetie.

500
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:47,691
Tina?

501
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:15,931
Who are you?

502
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:33,011
Baby, wake up.

503
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:35,451
Honey. Dylan.

504
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,571
Dylan, get over here!
Honey! Honey!

505
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,651
Come on.

506
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,371
OK, sugar, we're gonna
go back to bed now.

507
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,731
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.

508
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:49,571
Honey, you have to sleep.

509
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:55,531
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

510
00:38:55,651 --> 00:38:57,451
Where did you hear that?

511
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:00,971
Did you hear that on that movie?
Did you answer the phone?

512
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:05,051
Dylan,
where did you hear that song?

513
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,531
In my bed.

514
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,251
In your bed?

515
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:13,491
Under my covers. Kids singing.

516
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:16,531
Way down there with the man.

517
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:18,651
The mean man.

518
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:23,811
What is that man doing?

519
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:25,971
Trying to get up.

520
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:29,011
Trying to get up into our world.

521
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:00,491
Where's Daddy now?

522
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:08,131
Daddy's in heaven.

523
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:11,931
He's with God now.

524
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:18,931
Do you have to die to see God?

525
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:20,611
I don't think so.

526
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,531
I think you have to pray.

527
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:30,131
And reach out.

528
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:37,971
Why does God let there
be bad things?

529
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:43,531
I honestly don't know, honey.

530
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,451
Please try to get some sleep.

531
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:00,611
Can you come with me
in my dreams?

532
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:07,451
I think that only
happens in the movies.

533
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:12,811
But I'll always, always...

534
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:15,051
be right here when you get back.

535
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:22,691
And I'll make sure
that nobody gets your toes.

536
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,491
I know his behaviour
is bizarre...

537
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,011
but he's usually so normal
and well adjusted, John...

538
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:17,171
I can't believe it's him...

539
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:19,971
and not something outside
influencing him.

540
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:23,291
Or is that how denial works?

541
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,611
It is denial.

542
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:28,251
I don't think
that's the case here.

543
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:29,891
If you're really worried
about Dylan...

544
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:31,851
have a doctor check him out.

545
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:33,411
You'll see. Everything's fine.

546
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:37,091
You're not just saying that
to help a crazy friend cope?

547
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:41,491
Everything about Dylan's
behaviour is understandable...

548
00:42:41,611 --> 00:42:44,571
for a kid
who just lost his father.

549
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:48,011
How does a child
process a thing like that?

550
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:49,571
I don't know.

551
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:53,811
I've not been able
to process it very well myself.

552
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:56,571
And you're not crazy,
by the way.

553
00:42:56,691 --> 00:43:00,011
Seeing Freddy in that grave
and then jumping in...

554
00:43:00,131 --> 00:43:01,171
you didn't jump in.

555
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,211
That's my memory.
It seemed absolutely real.

556
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,651
"Seemed," not "was."

557
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:11,531
It's in my family, you know.

558
00:43:11,651 --> 00:43:13,491
What is?

559
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:16,451
A very close relative
died in an institution.

560
00:43:16,571 --> 00:43:20,651
Really? If having a screwy
family made a person crazy...

561
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:23,771
the whole world
would be one big loony bin.

562
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,931
You have a crazed fan after you.

563
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:32,291
That's what's making you crazy.
Probably Dylan, too.

564
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:33,891
I never mentioned that to him.

565
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:37,011
Kids know when something's
bugging the parent.

566
00:43:38,531 --> 00:43:41,651
You have no idea
who this is calling?

567
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:44,251
- Freddy, for all I know.
- Come on.

568
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:46,331
He's a man.

569
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:52,251
Or a boy
with a deep Freddy voice.

570
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:55,611
Six weeks, and you're surprised
you got Freddy in your dreams?

571
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:57,931
Hell, Sonny Bono,
after a while...

572
00:43:58,051 --> 00:44:01,051
began seeing his stalker
everywhere, even at Mass.

573
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,211
Really?

574
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,731
How many times
did Letterman call the cops...

575
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,251
thinking that woman
was down in the kitchen again?

576
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:13,411
Really gets under your skin
if you let it.

577
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:19,731
You really think Dylan's OK?

578
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:22,971
Dylan's fine. You're fine.

579
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,971
You're hurting,
but you're fine...

580
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:26,651
and you're definitely not crazy.

581
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:28,931
My worst fear...

582
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:33,251
that whatever madness
is in my family I have...

583
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:44,931
and I've passed it onto Dylan.

584
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:05,811
- Make sure he's OK, John.
- Are you all right?

585
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:08,331
Are you OK? Are you sure?
Does anything hurt?

586
00:45:08,451 --> 00:45:10,051
Dylan, are you all right?

587
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:13,371
Honey, are you all right?
Are you sure?

588
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:15,731
God wouldn't take me.

589
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:20,291
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.

590
00:45:20,411 --> 00:45:21,811
It's unbelievable.

591
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:20,131
- You doing all right?
- Hanging in there.

592
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,171
You know the guy that was
calling me all the time?

593
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:23,571
He started again...

594
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:25,531
and he's putting stuff
in my mail again.

595
00:46:25,691 --> 00:46:28,251
Listen, the S.O.B. Probably
read about the funeral...

596
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:29,571
in the papers or something.

597
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:31,811
Sick mother.

598
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:34,371
That's the last thing
you need right now, I'm sure.

599
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:37,731
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.

600
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:40,051
Wait a second.
Now, let me get this straight.

601
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:43,851
You're having nightmares
about Freddy? As in me?

602
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:47,971
No. It isn't you. He's scarier.

603
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:50,731
He's...

604
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:52,691
Darker?

605
00:46:53,771 --> 00:46:54,731
More evil?

606
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:57,851
Yeah. How did you know?

607
00:46:57,971 --> 00:46:59,771
Call it a guess.

608
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:01,811
Pretty damn good guess.

609
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:05,211
Anyway
what I was calling about was...

610
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:07,491
have you seen any of the script
by any chance?

611
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:11,091
No. Wes won't show it
until he's finished.

612
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:12,651
At least that's what he told me.

613
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:14,011
When is it gonna be done?

614
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:17,131
The way he's writing, who knows?

615
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,131
It's so weird.

616
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:20,971
I asked him how far
he was at the funeral.

617
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,211
What did he say? Oh, yeah.

618
00:47:23,331 --> 00:47:26,131
"As far as Dylan
trying to reach God."

619
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:29,091
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?

620
00:47:29,251 --> 00:47:31,811
Putting your kid in the script.

621
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:35,891
Robert...
have you been having nightmares?

622
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:42,251
Look, we need to talk,
but not over the phone.

623
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:44,251
Can I come over?

624
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:49,131
Actually, Heather...
today's no good.

625
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:52,971
There's something
I have to finish.

626
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:54,411
Tomorrow maybe, huh?

627
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:57,571
OK, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.

628
00:47:57,691 --> 00:48:00,131
And meanwhile, Robert,
take care, OK?

629
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,411
Yeah. Sure.

630
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:23,822
Damn it!

631
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:43,782
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

632
00:50:52,662 --> 00:50:56,702
Three, four,
better lock your door

633
00:51:00,702 --> 00:51:04,822
Five, six, grab your crucifix

634
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:12,102
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

635
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:16,182
Dylan, don't sing that song.

636
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:22,022
Nine, ten, never sleep again!

637
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:27,502
Dylan! Stop it!

638
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,982
No! Don't!

639
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:36,342
Never sleep again

640
00:51:36,462 --> 00:51:39,982
Never sleep again

641
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:43,062
Never sleep again

642
00:51:43,182 --> 00:51:45,702
Never sleep again

643
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:25,822
I touched him.

644
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:56,062
Any history of epilepsy
in your family?

645
00:52:57,582 --> 00:52:58,622
Diabetes?

646
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:04,342
Was there a trigger event,
trauma, shock?

647
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:07,782
You haven't shown him
the films you've made, have you?

648
00:53:07,902 --> 00:53:09,382
The horror stuff?

649
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:11,822
His father just passed away.

650
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,902
I'm sorry.

651
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:18,382
But I'm convinced
those films can tip...

652
00:53:18,502 --> 00:53:20,942
an unstable child over the edge.

653
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:22,182
Unstable?

654
00:53:23,182 --> 00:53:26,182
Dylan's not unstable.
He's just upset.

655
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:28,742
We'll run a battery of tests
and know in a few days.

656
00:53:28,862 --> 00:53:31,142
Does he have to stay overnight?

657
00:53:31,262 --> 00:53:32,582
Absolutely.

658
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:41,542
Anything more happen
we need to know about?

659
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:44,382
Like what?

660
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:48,782
Sometimes what a child
says or fantasizes...

661
00:53:48,902 --> 00:53:50,982
will give a clue
to what ails him.

662
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,582
Did he say anything
while he was still lucid?

663
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:12,302
What do we have here?

664
00:54:12,422 --> 00:54:14,782
Too soon to know for sure.

665
00:54:14,902 --> 00:54:17,942
The early symptoms point
to childhood schizophrenia.

666
00:54:21,982 --> 00:54:24,222
Dylan, can you hear me?

667
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:30,182
Dylan, you have to fight it,
whatever is after you...

668
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:31,982
and you got to come back to me.

669
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,782
You can't make it alone.
Do you hear?

670
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:41,062
If you can hear me, tell me
what you need to feel safe.

671
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,982
Rex? Is that what you want?

672
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:56,902
Well, Rex is at home,
and that's where you should be.

673
00:54:57,022 --> 00:55:00,422
But you got to get better before
they'll let you come home.

674
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:01,662
Do you understand?

675
00:55:03,022 --> 00:55:04,982
Home.

676
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,702
Home. Home, that's right.

677
00:55:07,822 --> 00:55:09,982
That's where I want you,
sweetie.

678
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:12,862
And, you know,
we're not that far away.

679
00:55:12,982 --> 00:55:15,822
Look right out there.

680
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:19,022
Past the freeway is our home.

681
00:55:19,142 --> 00:55:23,942
But to get there, you have to
come out from where you are...

682
00:55:24,062 --> 00:55:27,662
so that they'll let you
come home to Rex.

683
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,062
And to me.

684
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:32,342
Time for your medicine, cowboy.

685
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:36,422
- Here you go.
- What is that?

686
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,422
Something to help him sleep.

687
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:44,822
There you go. It looks good.

688
00:55:50,182 --> 00:55:51,622
There you go.

689
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:57,182
Good. Good. Attaboy.

690
00:55:57,302 --> 00:55:59,222
Come on,
lie down and take a little nap.

691
00:55:59,342 --> 00:56:01,062
You should get some rest, too.

692
00:56:01,182 --> 00:56:03,342
He's going to be fine.
We're gonna do some tests...

693
00:56:03,462 --> 00:56:04,902
and then
you can come back later.

694
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:08,862
Can you get
that other side, please?

695
00:56:08,982 --> 00:56:10,782
I grabbed his things.

696
00:56:10,902 --> 00:56:12,942
These are
his favourite pyjamas here.

697
00:56:16,462 --> 00:56:18,262
Honey, I've got to go.

698
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:19,502
I love you, Dylan.

699
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:22,062
Remember what I said.

700
00:56:24,022 --> 00:56:25,702
We'll take care of everything.

701
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:19,462
Wake up, lady!

702
00:57:22,742 --> 00:57:24,142
Don't lose it now!

703
00:57:40,062 --> 00:57:41,542
Seismologists at Cal Tech...

704
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:43,902
have counted
over 300 temblors so far.

705
00:57:44,062 --> 00:57:46,142
Though most were too faint
for us to feel...

706
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:48,942
seven have shaken our community
in the last few weeks...

707
00:57:49,102 --> 00:57:50,982
and now scientists
are speculating...

708
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:54,022
there might be an unknown fault
running beneath Los Angeles...

709
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:55,302
a fault that could...

710
00:58:05,302 --> 00:58:07,662
Hi. You've reached
the Englund residence.

711
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:09,022
We're out of town.

712
00:58:09,182 --> 00:58:11,382
You can leave a message
if you wish, but...

713
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:13,742
we'll be gone for some time.

714
00:58:37,622 --> 00:58:39,422
I wish I could tell you
where the script was going.

715
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:40,862
The fact is I don't know.

716
00:58:40,982 --> 00:58:45,022
I dream a scene at night,
I write it down in the morning.

717
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:47,422
Beyond that, your guess is as
good as mine where it's going.

718
00:58:47,582 --> 00:58:49,702
At least tell me
what it's about so far.

719
00:58:51,382 --> 00:58:53,182
- Coffee.
- Thanks.

720
00:58:53,302 --> 00:58:56,022
I can tell you what
the nightmare's about so far.

721
00:58:56,142 --> 00:59:00,102
It's about this entity...
whatever you want to call it.

722
00:59:00,222 --> 00:59:02,782
It's old. It's very old.

723
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:06,262
It's existed in different forms
in different times.

724
00:59:06,382 --> 00:59:09,182
The only thing that stays
the same is what it lives for.

725
00:59:09,342 --> 00:59:10,822
What is that?

726
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:12,702
The murder of innocents.

727
00:59:13,902 --> 00:59:17,262
This is still a script
we're talking about, right, Wes?

728
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:22,742
I sort of think of it
as a nightmare in progress.

729
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:24,502
In this nightmare in progress...

730
00:59:24,622 --> 00:59:26,422
does this thing
have any weaknesses?

731
00:59:26,582 --> 00:59:28,542
It can be captured sometimes.

732
00:59:28,662 --> 00:59:30,782
Captured? How?

733
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:32,782
By storytellers, of all things.

734
00:59:33,702 --> 00:59:36,502
Every so often, they imagine
a story good enough...

735
00:59:36,662 --> 00:59:38,462
to sort of catch its essence.

736
00:59:38,622 --> 00:59:41,422
Then, for a while,
it's held prisoner in the story.

737
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:45,502
- Like the genie in the bottle.
- Exactly.

738
00:59:45,622 --> 00:59:47,662
But the problem comes
when the story dies.

739
00:59:47,782 --> 00:59:48,982
And that can happen
in a lot of ways.

740
00:59:49,142 --> 00:59:50,662
It can get too familiar...

741
00:59:50,782 --> 00:59:53,542
or somebody waters it down
to make it an easier sell...

742
00:59:53,662 --> 00:59:58,022
or maybe it's so upsetting
that it's banned outright.

743
00:59:58,142 --> 01:00:00,502
However it happens,
when the story dies...

744
01:00:00,662 --> 01:00:02,622
the evil is set free.

745
01:00:02,742 --> 01:00:06,622
You're saying Freddy
is this ancient thing?

746
01:00:06,742 --> 01:00:09,382
Right. The current version.

747
01:00:09,502 --> 01:00:12,702
And for ten years, he's been
held captive as Freddy...

748
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:15,702
in the "Nightmare on Elm Street"
series, but...

749
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:19,942
now that the films have ended,
the genie's out of the bottle.

750
01:00:20,062 --> 01:00:23,742
That's what the nightmares
are telling me and I'm writing.

751
01:00:23,902 --> 01:00:28,382
If Freddy's loose in
your script, where's he going?

752
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:30,942
Another age? Another form?

753
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:34,262
No, that's not what
the dreams have him doing.

754
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:35,662
What is he doing?

755
01:00:36,902 --> 01:00:39,062
He's sort of gotten used
to being Freddy now...

756
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:41,542
and he likes
our time and space...

757
01:00:41,702 --> 01:00:46,182
so he's decided to cross over
out of films into our reality.

758
01:00:50,262 --> 01:00:52,382
Isn't there somebody
who can stop him?

759
01:00:52,502 --> 01:00:55,782
Actually there is a person
in the dream...

760
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,142
sort of a gatekeeper,
so to speak.

761
01:00:58,262 --> 01:01:00,702
Somebody Freddy has to get by...

762
01:01:00,862 --> 01:01:03,902
before he can
come into our world.

763
01:01:04,022 --> 01:01:06,542
That person's you, Heather.

764
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:07,862
It's me?

765
01:01:09,782 --> 01:01:10,942
Why me?

766
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:13,582
Dramatically speaking,
it makes perfect sense.

767
01:01:13,702 --> 01:01:15,182
You played Nancy, after all.

768
01:01:15,302 --> 01:01:17,422
You were the first
to humiliate him, defeat him.

769
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:20,062
That was Nancy. Not me.

770
01:01:20,182 --> 01:01:22,942
But you gave Nancy her strength.

771
01:01:23,062 --> 01:01:25,982
So in order to get out,
he's got to come through you.

772
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:30,102
He's gonna try to do that
at your most vulnerable points.

773
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,582
Oh, my God, Wes.

774
01:01:34,702 --> 01:01:36,022
Did you know?

775
01:01:37,782 --> 01:01:40,702
It was a script.
It was a dream.

776
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,822
I didn't know.

777
01:01:42,942 --> 01:01:45,782
You know damn well
it's more than that now.

778
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,022
How can we stop him?

779
01:01:53,782 --> 01:01:55,702
The only way
is to make another movie.

780
01:01:57,782 --> 01:01:59,742
I swear, I'm gonna stay
by this computer...

781
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:02,622
and keep writing until I finish
the script, but...

782
01:02:02,742 --> 01:02:05,342
when that time comes,
you'll have to make a choice.

783
01:02:05,462 --> 01:02:06,942
Choice?

784
01:02:07,062 --> 01:02:08,382
What kind of choice?

785
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:11,582
Whether or not you're willing
to play Nancy one last time.

786
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:39,662
"Many of the symptoms
of childhood schizophrenia...

787
01:02:39,782 --> 01:02:41,102
"are duplicated in children...

788
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:43,982
"suffering
from sleep deprivation."

789
01:02:50,262 --> 01:02:53,422
"Sleep deprivation can produce
trance-Like states...

790
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,502
"mechanical behaviour.

791
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:57,302
"The child might..."

792
01:02:57,422 --> 01:02:59,262
Rex woke me up.

793
01:02:59,382 --> 01:03:02,422
He was fighting the mean old man
with the claws.

794
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:04,742
You have no idea
who this is calling?

795
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:06,222
Freddy, for all I know.

796
01:03:06,342 --> 01:03:07,422
As in me?

797
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:10,102
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.

798
01:03:10,222 --> 01:03:11,902
Darker, more evil?

799
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:13,182
How did you know?

800
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:17,102
He's decided to cross over,
out of films, into our reality.

801
01:03:17,222 --> 01:03:20,662
Never sleep again.

802
01:03:31,662 --> 01:03:35,422
The world of horror films
suffered its own terror today...

803
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:38,622
as two of Hollywood's best known
special-Effects technicians...

804
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:41,182
were found dead
in a vacant field.

805
01:03:41,302 --> 01:03:43,422
Terrance Feinstein
and Charles Wilson...

806
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,142
two special-effects artists...

807
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:47,342
reputedly working
on a top-Secret project...

808
01:03:47,462 --> 01:03:49,502
for the makers of
the Freddy Krueger films...

809
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:53,222
were found brutally slashed
to death early this morning.

810
01:04:01,822 --> 01:04:02,942
Freddy's glove was missing...

811
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:05,782
and police are speculating
the murders were the result...

812
01:04:05,902 --> 01:04:07,102
of a botched theft...

813
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:09,982
which apparently took place
two days ago.

814
01:04:10,102 --> 01:04:12,702
At this point,
the murder weapon has not...

815
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,582
Oh, God.

816
01:05:13,782 --> 01:05:14,822
Miss me?

817
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:41,702
Nancy.

818
01:06:08,862 --> 01:06:10,862
There are no visiting hours
this late.

819
01:06:10,982 --> 01:06:12,022
You must understand.

820
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:13,422
No, I don't understand.

821
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:15,022
I told you I'm his baby-sitter.

822
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:17,222
I'm a close friend
of the family, damn it.

823
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:19,422
I just need to see him
for a minute.

824
01:06:19,582 --> 01:06:20,622
Sixty seconds. Come on.

825
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:22,902
You have to understand.
You can't see him.

826
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:26,742
What are you doing here?

827
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:29,862
I don't know.

828
01:06:31,182 --> 01:06:33,382
I had this really terrible dream
about Dylan.

829
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,742
I had to come and see him.

830
01:06:35,902 --> 01:06:38,342
You must think I'm crazy.

831
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:41,062
No, I don't.

832
01:06:41,222 --> 01:06:42,342
Is he all right?

833
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:45,142
I don't know.
They wouldn't let me in.

834
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,262
There are no evening visiting
hours in intensive care.

835
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:49,622
Is he all right?

836
01:06:49,782 --> 01:06:51,942
Dylan? He's holding well.

837
01:06:52,102 --> 01:06:53,862
Earlier he had some problems.

838
01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:56,822
- He's in an oxygen tent now.
- Oh, my God.

839
01:06:59,622 --> 01:07:02,982
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp. May I?

840
01:07:05,382 --> 01:07:07,582
Those are nasty cuts.

841
01:07:07,742 --> 01:07:08,902
How did you get them?

842
01:07:09,062 --> 01:07:12,102
It happened in the earthquake.

843
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:13,302
I fell.

844
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:14,862
I need to see Dylan.

845
01:07:14,982 --> 01:07:18,102
In a moment.
First let's see about you.

846
01:07:22,182 --> 01:07:26,062
If these had been a few inches
nearer the wrist...

847
01:07:26,182 --> 01:07:28,462
what did you say
you cut yourself on?

848
01:07:28,622 --> 01:07:30,902
It was the earthquake.
It was dark. I have no idea.

849
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:33,782
But these look quite fresh.

850
01:07:33,902 --> 01:07:36,542
They are. It happened
in tonight's earthquake.

851
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:40,862
It happened just 15 minutes ago.

852
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:42,422
You must have felt it.

853
01:07:45,182 --> 01:07:46,982
Guess we lucked out over here.

854
01:07:49,502 --> 01:07:51,222
Your son...

855
01:07:51,382 --> 01:07:54,502
is apparently
terrified of a man...

856
01:07:54,662 --> 01:07:58,142
someone he thinks
is going to come out of his bed.

857
01:07:58,302 --> 01:08:01,662
One of the nurses heard him
talking to himself.

858
01:08:01,782 --> 01:08:04,502
Do you have any idea
who that man is?

859
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:08,102
I forgot to bring
his dinosaur Rex.

860
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:11,222
He keeps Freddy
from coming up out of his...

861
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:13,862
bed.

862
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:15,822
The man from your films?

863
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:18,302
Freddy Krueger?

864
01:08:19,302 --> 01:08:20,342
With the claws?

865
01:08:21,862 --> 01:08:23,422
Is that who he's afraid of?

866
01:08:28,902 --> 01:08:31,942
You have let your child
see your films, haven't you?

867
01:08:32,102 --> 01:08:34,382
Every kid knows who Freddy is.

868
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:36,342
He's like Santa Claus...

869
01:08:36,462 --> 01:08:38,102
or King Kong or...

870
01:08:40,902 --> 01:08:44,102
well, interesting talking
with you, Miss Langenkamp.

871
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:47,422
I hope you understand.

872
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:50,302
My concerns are simply
for the welfare of your son.

873
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:12,182
How's he doing?

874
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:56,782
Honey.

875
01:09:57,676 --> 01:10:00,921
- You shouldn't do that.
- Too late.

876
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:05,582
I'm almost there, Heather.

877
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,182
Almost there.

878
01:10:13,702 --> 01:10:15,742
Daddy!

879
01:10:23,942 --> 01:10:26,222
- Doctor!
- Keep her right there.

880
01:10:26,342 --> 01:10:27,662
We can't hold him much longer.

881
01:10:27,782 --> 01:10:30,262
Get the full anaesthetic, stat.

882
01:10:30,382 --> 01:10:31,662
We don't have that here.

883
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:34,702
No anaesthetic, you say?
Screw it. I'm going in.

884
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:36,862
Little booger's full of
something I don't like.

885
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:39,662
Let's get him open,
good and proper.

886
01:10:39,782 --> 01:10:41,382
Cut this evil out of him.

887
01:10:46,182 --> 01:10:48,102
- Gloria!
- He's got my baby!

888
01:10:48,222 --> 01:10:49,982
- Who?
- Freddy!

889
01:10:50,102 --> 01:10:51,662
Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?

890
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:53,582
- What the hell's going on?
- My baby!

891
01:10:53,702 --> 01:10:55,582
Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.

892
01:10:57,662 --> 01:11:00,582
I suggest you go home
and get some rest.

893
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:01,902
Your son is fine.

894
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:04,302
He's downstairs
for further testing.

895
01:11:04,422 --> 01:11:05,622
But he was just here.

896
01:11:05,742 --> 01:11:09,422
He was here, you fell asleep,
we took him.

897
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:11,382
You looked so exhausted...

898
01:11:11,502 --> 01:11:13,422
frankly,
we didn't want to wake you.

899
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:16,302
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.

900
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:18,382
That's his baby-Sitter, right?

901
01:11:18,502 --> 01:11:21,142
Believe me. Everything is fine.

902
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:24,142
Everything's not fine.

903
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:26,822
Damn!

904
01:11:26,942 --> 01:11:28,022
Call security.

905
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:33,782
Security, code yellow.

906
01:11:33,902 --> 01:11:34,942
Pediatric testing.

907
01:11:41,222 --> 01:11:43,982
This is a restricted area.
Do you have a pass?

908
01:11:44,102 --> 01:11:45,102
Screw your pass.

909
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:46,502
It's all right.

910
01:11:46,622 --> 01:11:47,622
Where is he?

911
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:49,422
Just stay calm.

912
01:11:49,542 --> 01:11:50,862
How's her little boy doing?

913
01:11:50,982 --> 01:11:52,382
He's fine, actually.

914
01:11:52,502 --> 01:11:54,702
He came around
about ten minutes ago.

915
01:11:54,822 --> 01:11:58,222
He seems to be suffering
from acute sleep deprivation.

916
01:11:58,342 --> 01:12:00,622
I don't think
she ever lets him sleep.

917
01:12:00,742 --> 01:12:01,902
What are you saying?

918
01:12:02,022 --> 01:12:03,102
Where is he?

919
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:07,542
I've got someone here
who wants to see you.

920
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:21,582
Are you OK, champ?

921
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:23,582
Can we go get Rex now?

922
01:12:23,702 --> 01:12:25,982
The bad man's getting
awful close.

923
01:12:26,862 --> 01:12:28,622
I know he is.

924
01:12:28,742 --> 01:12:31,422
We're gonna go get Rex
right now.

925
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:34,062
I'm afraid Dylan should
stay here until we know...

926
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:36,582
what's causing these episodes.

927
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:40,622
I'm sure you understand.

928
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:44,182
Good.

929
01:12:48,982 --> 01:12:50,622
I'll tell you what.

930
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:53,262
I'm gonna go home
and get Rex right now.

931
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:55,342
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?

932
01:12:55,462 --> 01:12:56,982
Right across the freeway.

933
01:12:57,102 --> 01:12:58,102
That's right.

934
01:12:58,222 --> 01:12:59,542
I won't be gone long...

935
01:12:59,662 --> 01:13:02,062
and Julie's gonna stay here
with you.

936
01:13:02,182 --> 01:13:03,422
Yeah, you bet.

937
01:13:05,222 --> 01:13:08,342
Hurry up, please. I'm sleepy.

938
01:13:10,942 --> 01:13:13,582
I promise. Cross my heart.

939
01:13:13,702 --> 01:13:15,342
But, Dylan...

940
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:17,742
until Mommy gets back...

941
01:13:17,862 --> 01:13:19,462
whatever you do...

942
01:13:19,582 --> 01:13:20,862
don't fall asleep.

943
01:13:23,462 --> 01:13:25,822
Julie, don't let him
out of your sight.

944
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:30,382
What's going on?
Your hair's turning grey.

945
01:13:31,942 --> 01:13:34,022
Julie, keep him awake.

946
01:13:34,942 --> 01:13:36,702
Understand?

947
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:44,022
Excuse me, miss.
Would you come with us?

948
01:13:44,142 --> 01:13:45,742
What? Hey!

949
01:13:45,862 --> 01:13:47,742
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

950
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:49,462
Get your hands off me!

951
01:13:51,462 --> 01:13:53,902
Do you mind?
What the hell is this?

952
01:13:54,022 --> 01:13:55,822
Just a quick word...

953
01:13:55,942 --> 01:13:57,622
for Dylan's sake.

954
01:14:02,422 --> 01:14:06,382
We've had an ex citing day,
haven't we?

955
01:14:08,102 --> 01:14:10,382
This one?

956
01:14:10,502 --> 01:14:12,382
Right there.

957
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:17,262
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

958
01:14:17,382 --> 01:14:18,942
You won.

959
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:31,902
Would you mind stepping outside
for one moment?

960
01:14:32,022 --> 01:14:34,462
As a matter of fact, I would.

961
01:14:34,582 --> 01:14:35,742
What are you doing?

962
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:38,782
It's just a little shot
to see that he sleeps.

963
01:14:38,902 --> 01:14:40,702
No. His mother
specifically said...

964
01:14:41,862 --> 01:14:43,582
- I said no.
- Do it.

965
01:14:46,422 --> 01:14:47,542
All done.

966
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:51,102
He'll be asleep soon.

967
01:14:51,222 --> 01:14:53,822
- Would you let go of my arm?
- You bitch!

968
01:14:56,262 --> 01:14:58,302
Hey, you can't do that!

969
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:05,462
I know what's in that one.
Do you know what's in this one?

970
01:15:05,582 --> 01:15:08,262
Or what's gonna happen to you
when I stick you with it?

971
01:15:09,382 --> 01:15:10,982
And I will.

972
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:20,182
I want you to stay awake, OK?

973
01:15:20,302 --> 01:15:23,022
Keep your eyes open for me.
Come on.

974
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:29,302
Has there been any use
of recreational drugs...

975
01:15:29,422 --> 01:15:31,342
in your family?

976
01:15:31,462 --> 01:15:33,742
Or any history
of mental disturbance?

977
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:35,982
What are you asking?

978
01:15:36,102 --> 01:15:38,502
Please, don't take it wrong.

979
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:41,542
If there was,
there's a good chance...

980
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:44,262
Dylan could be suffering from
something passed down to him.

981
01:15:46,102 --> 01:15:49,182
Have you been suffering
from any delusional events?

982
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:57,582
This man from your films...

983
01:15:57,702 --> 01:15:59,582
Freddy Krueger.

984
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:02,942
Have you been seeing him?

985
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:12,462
Would you get those keys
down here?

986
01:16:12,582 --> 01:16:14,502
I want you to stay awake.

987
01:16:14,622 --> 01:16:16,302
Keep your eyes open for me.

988
01:16:16,422 --> 01:16:18,502
Where's Mommy?

989
01:16:18,622 --> 01:16:20,142
She'll be back. Now stay awake.

990
01:16:20,262 --> 01:16:25,422
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.

991
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:27,342
We could...

992
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:30,422
put Dylan in foster care
for a short while.

993
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:33,382
Just long enough to run
some tests on you.

994
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,902
Keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, OK?

995
01:16:36,022 --> 01:16:38,822
Come on. You can stay awake.
Stay awake for me.

996
01:16:38,942 --> 01:16:40,422
I want you to stay awake.

997
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,262
Keep your eyes open.

998
01:16:46,062 --> 01:16:47,902
Dylan, what's the matter?

999
01:16:50,782 --> 01:16:53,022
Julie, behind you.

1000
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:01,102
There's nothing there.

1001
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:03,342
Dylan, what's wrong?

1002
01:17:03,462 --> 01:17:06,662
Dylan, stop it.
You're scaring me.

1003
01:17:11,782 --> 01:17:14,062
I want my son out of here
right now.

1004
01:17:14,742 --> 01:17:16,142
Very well.

1005
01:17:16,262 --> 01:17:18,702
As soon as we can gather
the appropriate papers.

1006
01:17:18,822 --> 01:17:20,422
You don't understand.

1007
01:17:20,542 --> 01:17:22,342
If Dylan falls asleep, then...

1008
01:17:23,902 --> 01:17:25,182
I got it.

1009
01:17:37,222 --> 01:17:38,462
Dylan, get out of here!

1010
01:17:51,302 --> 01:17:53,582
Ever play skin the cat?

1011
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,262
Come on.

1012
01:18:17,782 --> 01:18:18,862
Help me.

1013
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:27,822
Mom!

1014
01:18:27,982 --> 01:18:31,182
Rex!

1015
01:18:31,342 --> 01:18:32,542
What the hell's going on?

1016
01:18:35,582 --> 01:18:37,342
You can't go in there. No.

1017
01:18:38,382 --> 01:18:39,422
Wait, wait.

1018
01:18:43,942 --> 01:18:46,142
Code yellow
to paediatric testing.

1019
01:18:53,102 --> 01:18:54,942
Where's my son?!

1020
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:56,102
Where is he?!

1021
01:18:58,222 --> 01:18:59,542
Have you seen my son?

1022
01:18:59,662 --> 01:19:01,702
He was just here.

1023
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,822
The boy.

1024
01:19:02,982 --> 01:19:05,422
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.

1025
01:19:05,582 --> 01:19:07,382
He doesn't have to be awake
to be on his feet.

1026
01:19:07,502 --> 01:19:09,582
- What?
- He sleepwalks, you idiot.

1027
01:19:09,742 --> 01:19:12,382
He's fully capable of walking
out of this hospital.

1028
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:13,502
Oh, shit.

1029
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:27,102
John, it's Heather.
I need your help.

1030
01:19:28,302 --> 01:19:29,622
Why? What happened?

1031
01:19:29,742 --> 01:19:31,222
Dylan's run away
from the hospital.

1032
01:19:31,382 --> 01:19:33,862
I don't know if he's wandering
or headed for the house...

1033
01:19:34,022 --> 01:19:35,262
but I think Freddy's after him.

1034
01:19:35,422 --> 01:19:36,902
I know that sounds crazy, but...

1035
01:19:37,062 --> 01:19:38,702
you're right. That sounds crazy.

1036
01:19:41,022 --> 01:19:42,062
Oh, my God.

1037
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:55,062
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?

1038
01:19:57,022 --> 01:19:58,502
Right across the freeway.

1039
01:20:37,982 --> 01:20:40,182
Krueger, you bastard!

1040
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:42,382
Take me!

1041
01:21:14,382 --> 01:21:15,662
Are you OK?

1042
01:21:15,782 --> 01:21:16,742
You OK?

1043
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:25,702
My son is out here!

1044
01:21:27,982 --> 01:21:30,142
Let me go! Dylan!

1045
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:11,302
I'm sorry. What happened to you?
Are you all right?

1046
01:22:11,422 --> 01:22:13,142
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?

1047
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,862
Take it easy, take it easy.

1048
01:22:14,982 --> 01:22:16,782
Relax. He's right there.
What happened?

1049
01:22:18,982 --> 01:22:20,342
Oh, God.

1050
01:22:21,422 --> 01:22:22,942
What's going on, Heather?

1051
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:24,582
What in the world happened?

1052
01:22:25,702 --> 01:22:27,662
I know how Chase really died.

1053
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:30,822
- What do you mean?
- Fred Krueger did it.

1054
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:35,342
Yeah. Sure.

1055
01:22:45,182 --> 01:22:46,782
You saw him, didn't you?

1056
01:22:46,902 --> 01:22:49,302
Coming for you

1057
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:51,382
Nancy, let's go outside.

1058
01:22:51,502 --> 01:22:52,822
He'll be all right.

1059
01:22:54,062 --> 01:22:55,742
I'll be right back.

1060
01:23:17,422 --> 01:23:19,222
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?

1061
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,382
Why are you calling me Nancy,
John?

1062
01:23:23,502 --> 01:23:25,502
Why are you calling me John?

1063
01:23:31,302 --> 01:23:32,982
Nancy, pull yourself together...

1064
01:23:33,102 --> 01:23:35,182
before you make yourself
and that kid nuts.

1065
01:23:43,142 --> 01:23:44,662
Would you call Robert?

1066
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:46,862
Robert Englund.

1067
01:23:48,622 --> 01:23:50,702
- The guy who plays Freddy.
- Freddy who?

1068
01:23:50,822 --> 01:23:52,062
Freddy Krueger.

1069
01:23:54,022 --> 01:23:56,622
Nancy, Freddy's dead.

1070
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:04,502
Don't start losing it
like your mother did.

1071
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,582
I love you, sweetheart.

1072
01:24:09,622 --> 01:24:10,742
Don't forget that.

1073
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:21,422
I love you, too...

1074
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:22,542
Daddy.

1075
01:24:49,582 --> 01:24:52,902
Get yourself some rest,
Nancy, please.

1076
01:25:24,822 --> 01:25:29,822
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

1077
01:25:37,982 --> 01:25:39,822
Who's there?

1078
01:25:42,062 --> 01:25:45,062
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.

1079
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:47,142
I'm gonna get the guy
who did it...

1080
01:25:47,262 --> 01:25:50,022
and I want you to arrest him
when I bring him out, OK?

1081
01:25:50,142 --> 01:25:53,582
Nancy, just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

1082
01:25:53,702 --> 01:25:55,302
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.

1083
01:25:55,422 --> 01:25:56,702
Yeah, sure.

1084
01:26:28,742 --> 01:26:30,822
Dylan's sleeping pills.

1085
01:26:31,782 --> 01:26:34,102
Say how they find
their way back home.

1086
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:35,622
It's important.

1087
01:26:37,582 --> 01:26:38,622
Breadcrumbs.

1088
01:26:43,742 --> 01:26:44,782
Too late, Heather.

1089
01:26:46,382 --> 01:26:48,182
Too late.

1090
01:27:44,262 --> 01:27:46,102
Join you.

1091
01:27:47,742 --> 01:27:50,182
You've given me a way
to join you.

1092
01:30:23,382 --> 01:30:26,142
Almost there.

1093
01:31:05,862 --> 01:31:08,742
"The more she read,
the more she realized...

1094
01:31:08,862 --> 01:31:12,062
"what she had in her hands
was nothing more or less...

1095
01:31:12,182 --> 01:31:14,222
"than her life itself.

1096
01:31:14,382 --> 01:31:17,182
"That everything she had
experienced and thought...

1097
01:31:17,302 --> 01:31:19,342
"was bound within these pages."

1098
01:31:22,062 --> 01:31:24,262
"There was no movie.

1099
01:31:24,382 --> 01:31:27,342
"There was only... her life."

1100
01:31:29,062 --> 01:31:30,542
It's just me.

1101
01:31:34,982 --> 01:31:37,102
Are you OK? Are you all right?

1102
01:31:37,862 --> 01:31:38,822
Where's the man?

1103
01:31:38,982 --> 01:31:40,462
I don't know.

1104
01:31:40,582 --> 01:31:43,022
He had me,
but then he let me go.

1105
01:31:46,262 --> 01:31:47,902
Meet your maker.

1106
01:31:58,702 --> 01:32:00,502
Pick a pet for the rugrat,
bitch.

1107
01:32:11,702 --> 01:32:13,182
Fuck you!

1108
01:32:16,742 --> 01:32:18,382
Get over there, Dylan!

1109
01:32:39,382 --> 01:32:40,422
Take this!

1110
01:32:52,502 --> 01:32:55,182
Come here, my piggy.
I got some gingerbread for you.

1111
01:33:14,902 --> 01:33:15,902
Gotcha!

1112
01:33:28,662 --> 01:33:31,902
Where's your mommy,
piglet, huh, huh?

1113
01:33:33,462 --> 01:33:37,342
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

1114
01:35:10,382 --> 01:35:11,862
Come to papa.

1115
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:18,102
Gonna eat you up.

1116
01:35:34,702 --> 01:35:36,942
Leave him alone!

1117
01:35:58,102 --> 01:36:00,382
Dylan, get out of there!

1118
01:36:56,262 --> 01:36:57,262
Push!

1119
01:37:23,142 --> 01:37:24,262
Run!

1120
01:37:56,062 --> 01:37:57,102
Are you OK?

1121
01:38:02,822 --> 01:38:04,582
Honey, honey.

1122
01:38:07,662 --> 01:38:09,382
Oh, my God.

1123
01:38:09,502 --> 01:38:12,542
We're saved. The witch is dead.

1124
01:38:12,662 --> 01:38:15,782
And his mother covered him
with kisses, and they were safe.

1125
01:38:27,222 --> 01:38:28,382
"Heather...

1126
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:31,102
"thanks for having the guts
to play Nancy one last time.

1127
01:38:31,222 --> 01:38:34,542
"At last Freddy's back
where he belongs.

1128
01:38:34,662 --> 01:38:36,462
"Regards, Wes."

1129
01:38:51,502 --> 01:38:53,702
Is it a story?

1130
01:38:53,822 --> 01:38:56,622
Yeah. It's a story.

1131
01:38:56,742 --> 01:38:58,302
Read me some.

1132
01:39:01,142 --> 01:39:04,062
"We open on an old wooden bench.

1133
01:39:04,182 --> 01:39:06,702
"There's fire and tools...

1134
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:08,862
"and a man's grimy hands...

1135
01:39:08,982 --> 01:39:13,502
"building what soon is revealed
as a gleaming set of claws.

1136
01:39:13,622 --> 01:39:15,782
"And the claws are moving now...

1137
01:39:15,902 --> 01:39:20,662
"as if awakening
from a long and unwanted sleep.

1138
01:39:20,782 --> 01:39:24,502
"Then the man lays one trembling
hand flat upon the table...

1139
01:39:24,622 --> 01:39:28,622
"and with his other
picks up a thick, sharp blade.

1140
01:39:28,742 --> 01:39:33,182
"Behind the lights,
faces watch from the darkness...

1141
01:39:33,302 --> 01:39:37,462
"ready to laugh
or scream in terror."
