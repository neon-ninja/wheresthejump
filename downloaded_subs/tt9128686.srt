1
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,208
Go!

2
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:21,619
"6 days earlier..."

3
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,625
Cut!

4
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,865
Why are the pool lights on?

5
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,953
Those are auto lights.

6
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,167
Art team!

7
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,042
Art team!

8
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:13,788
Yes.

9
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,206
You're an art guy?

10
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,375
Yes.

11
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,535
We've met before...

12
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,828
Good. Go check the underwater light...

13
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,916
That keeps going on and off.

14
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,165
Fix it quick. Gotta finish tonight.

15
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,577
They will close down the pool tomorrow.

16
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,583
Alright.

17
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,824
Day, here is lucky.

18
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:45,917
Babe.

19
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,953
I'd like to dive, can I?

20
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,708
Naughty girl.

21
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,994
Just once, please.

22
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,993
Please, please, please.

23
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,914
No, you can't.

24
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,868
Here you are.

25
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,368
Are you tired?

26
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,999
I'm sorry, I haven't taken you anywhere.

27
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,286
Alright, I understand.

28
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:48,792
Bad boy.

29
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,365
Worried that we'll get caught?

30
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:00,748
Lucky is here.

31
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,539
I have something for you.

32
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:12,748
Happy birthday.

33
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
Waste of money.

34
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,033
It's cute, you're grumpy.

35
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,042
Here.

36
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,250
Isn't it cute?

37
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,039
You don't like it?

38
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,539
Have you named the baby?

39
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,365
Come on,

40
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,248
don't say that.

41
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,698
Just kidding.

42
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,164
Just kidding.

43
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,619
I'm not pregnant. Don't be serious.

44
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,708
Lucky.

45
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,747
Lucky, come out.

46
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,833
- Mayom.
- Mayom.

47
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,665
If you stayed silent,
you'd have seen hot shot.

48
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,750
You've just missed it.

49
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,948
Hey, day.

50
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,908
The director is looking for your dog.

51
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,958
Go to the set.

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,865
I'm coming.

53
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:25,998
You work on set,

54
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,161
and bring your dog in for extra money.

55
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,748
Saving up for a wedding?

56
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,542
Day.

57
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,750
Keep it up.

58
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,822
- Bro.
- Yes.

59
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,199
When he says, you have the dog jump over

60
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,119
and cross the camera frame.

61
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,373
- Do you hear, lucky?
- Okay?

62
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,948
Make me proud.

63
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,118
Need rehearsal?

64
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,494
No, I trained him myself.

65
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,289
Come on. Get ready.

66
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,740
Sound, ready?

67
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,750
Yes.

68
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,369
Let him finish playing with his dog.

69
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,831
Then we start shooting

70
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,583
he's ready.

71
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,581
This is the last cut.

72
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,375
Action!

73
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:49,748
1, 2, 3...

74
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,165
It's a wrap!

75
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:07,490
"The pool"

76
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:41,792
Lucky.

77
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,580
Lucky, come here.

78
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,993
Come here. Come.

79
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,914
Come on, quick.

80
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,583
Come on, lucky.

81
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,375
Fetch the ball.

82
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,616
"Flooding crisis. Crocodile escaped"

83
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,744
"officers in search of crocodile"

84
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,655
Damn it, day! You leave stuff everywhere.

85
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,787
So comfortable, huh?

86
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,208
Get back up.

87
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,657
I've just released the water, come.

88
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,740
Why did you chain him?

89
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,741
Lucky enough that I haven't chained you.

90
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,576
He could have run around
and fallen into the water.

91
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,831
Day, your Insulin shot.

92
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,458
Better keep them in safe place.

93
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,407
"Koy"

94
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,202
you aren't coming back, are you?

95
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,789
Of course not.

96
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,039
See you in three months.

97
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,498
Clean up everything for me

98
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,955
and leave anything you don't need here.

99
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,498
This pool is no longer used.

100
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,616
Bribe me 300 for leaving work early.

101
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,702
I'm gonna miss my flight.

102
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,331
Order pizza for me then.

103
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,417
Come on.

104
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,458
Want pizza?

105
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,197
Pizza!

106
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,208
Hey.

107
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,822
I gotta go.

108
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,539
Nepal is waiting.

109
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,490
Good luck, man.

110
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,290
"Caution pool depth 6 m."

111
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,073
Ridiculous.

112
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,157
Calm down, lucky.

113
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,657
It's gonna be alright.

114
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,827
It's gonna be alright.

115
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,990
It's gonna be alright.

116
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,748
Help!

117
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,956
Help!

118
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,536
Help!

119
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,332
Help!

120
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,618
"Koy"

121
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,785
Get up, lucky. Up!

122
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,914
Pizza delivery!

123
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,367
Hello?

124
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,956
Hello. Hi.

125
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,031
What's up?

126
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:33,283
I don't see anyone here.

127
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,616
There's only a dog.

128
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,280
I just called out. Nobody is here.

129
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,875
Okay.

130
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,167
Yes.

131
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Help.

132
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,907
Help!

133
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,831
Can anyone hear me?

134
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Help!

135
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,198
Help!

136
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,823
Help!

137
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:12,407
Don't jump, koy!

138
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,532
Help!

139
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:00,078
Help!

140
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,115
Help!

141
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:06,292
Help!

142
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,325
Anybody help! Help!

143
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,993
Can you hear me, koy?

144
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,157
Nothing could be worse.

145
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,792
Go on,

146
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,250
keep barking.

147
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,368
Make yourself useful.

148
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,831
Lucky. Shut up.

149
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,032
Lucky, quiet.

150
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,164
No. No. No. No.

151
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,114
Lucky.

152
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,072
Let it go, lucky.

153
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,374
Don't bark at it. Let it go.

154
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,619
No. No. Lucky.

155
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,991
Lucky. You stupid dog.

156
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,615
You know what you've just done?

157
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:03,827
Don't be afraid, koy.

158
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,958
It's gonna be alright.

159
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,535
Someone will come to help us.

160
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:33,997
Lucky, shut up.

161
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:36,292
Shut up.

162
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,580
Koy.

163
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,868
Koy, be patient.

164
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:49,831
Bastard!

165
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,789
Help!

166
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,082
Anyone hear me?

167
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,998
Help me!

168
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,956
Help!

169
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,115
You are burning.

170
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,618
Help!

171
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,206
Help!

172
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:21,032
Help, please!

173
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,914
Help!

174
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,664
Does anyone hear me?

175
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:31,833
Help!

176
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,125
Day.

177
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:15,417
Koy.

178
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:16,708
Koy.

179
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Koy.

180
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,667
I'm here.

181
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,208
Are you alright?

182
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:41,914
What happened?

183
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,615
We are stuck in a swimming pool.

184
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,164
And what is that?

185
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,532
I thought he'd take the baby out of you.

186
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:06,792
Who...

187
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,205
Who'd take the baby out?

188
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:16,958
Damn,

189
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,831
how come she picked someone like you?

190
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,202
I'm handsome.

191
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:22,658
You are insulting her.

192
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,333
I'm serious.

193
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,949
What do I have against those rich guys
who were after her?

194
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,490
Seriously,

195
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,119
I heard that she is pregnant.

196
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,097
I would have told her to have an abortion.

197
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,448
What would she feel if she hears that?

198
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:40,875
I can't support her.

199
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,573
The baby will grow up struggling.

200
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,748
I haven't slept for how many nights now?

201
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,448
How can I be a father?

202
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,078
Aren't you a bit selfish?

203
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,243
She is not pregnant.

204
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,250
What if she is?

205
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,702
Abortion is illegal.

206
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,792
Don't do it.

207
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,375
It's also a sin.

208
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:07,292
Baby...

209
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Day.

210
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,365
You knew that?

211
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,539
Don't give up.

212
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,375
Day,

213
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,499
you can help me and the baby.

214
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,167
I know it.

215
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,583
How are you doing?

216
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,792
Hungry.

217
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,039
Poor lucky.

218
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,414
He is hungry like us.

219
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,125
Lucky.

220
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:28,708
Lucky.

221
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,202
Open your mouth.

222
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:31,702
Open it.

223
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,744
Open your mouth. Lucky.

224
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:34,993
Come on.

225
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Open it.

226
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,205
Share with us.

227
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:42,292
You...

228
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,698
Son of a bitch!

229
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,494
You are ungrateful.

230
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,158
When we make it up there,

231
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,327
you stay outside the house!

232
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,198
Don't you wish to sleep on our bed.

233
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,240
Eat up.

234
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,285
Still fresh.

235
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:16,997
And you?

236
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,535
I'm not hungry.

237
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,116
It'll go off anyway.

238
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,495
The baby would want his father to eat.

239
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,073
I love you, koy.

240
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,083
Liar.

241
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,117
You can't even take me to eat pizza.

242
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:49,365
I have to work.

243
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:52,454
Always about work.

244
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:54,948
Beg me please

245
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:06,623
Why are you crying?

246
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,870
I'm having my pizza now, day.

247
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,073
Do you want to order more?

248
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Lucky!

249
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,746
"Help"

250
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:16,407
Day.

251
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,456
Day.

252
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,535
Day.

253
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,323
Day.

254
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,080
Day.

255
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,160
Day.

256
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:40,698
Day.

257
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,083
Day.

258
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,625
Day.

259
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:58,202
I'm tired because of the heat.

260
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,083
Hey,

261
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,078
did he do anything to you?

262
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,706
It's not a 'he"'.

263
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,286
Is it a female crocodile?

264
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:15,958
Come on. Come on.

265
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,032
Have you done this before?

266
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,250
At home,

267
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,407
I didn't have a match.

268
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:52,542
No lighter.

269
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:53,952
No stove.

270
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:55,875
I lived in a cave.

271
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:58,456
This was how I started a fire.

272
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,125
Funny.

273
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,115
So not true.

274
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,369
I watched it from castaway.

275
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,833
Take it easy.

276
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,743
You have to eat.

277
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:28,833
Let's share.

278
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,786
We can't stay here any longer.

279
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,868
Gotta find a way out.

280
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,786
Day... a little higher.

281
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,208
Day.

282
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,532
Day. I can't do it!

283
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:27,708
Okay.

284
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:30,124
Okay, koy. It's alright.

285
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:34,667
Get down.

286
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:42,117
We can never get out this way.

287
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,369
We have to let the crocodile up.

288
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:49,448
And you go into the tunnel.

289
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,331
There will be a place you can hide.

290
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,532
If I'm not around...

291
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:57,907
She will come after you for sure.

292
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:01,958
Koy.

293
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Don't be stubborn.

294
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,660
The doll is gone.

295
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,282
Might have fallen off up there.

296
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,417
Hey.

297
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,240
You didn't take it out, did you?

298
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:50,292
Day.

299
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,750
Hmm?

300
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,167
Day.

301
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,619
You never want me to have
an abortion, do you?

302
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,035
I'm sorry.

303
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,375
Day.

304
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Koy.

305
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,122
Come on.

306
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,125
Day!

307
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,456
Why?

308
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,208
Why?

309
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Why?

310
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:54,042
Why?

311
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:59,033
Why are you so cruel?

312
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:05,539
Think about it.

313
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:09,410
If the baby is born,

314
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:12,407
and I'm still like this...

315
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,286
How disappointed would it be...

316
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:19,539
That his father is struggling so bad?

317
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:23,657
It's not, day.

318
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,538
It's not true.

319
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:29,415
Look around you, day.

320
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,993
How could you be worse than this?

321
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:42,748
Listen to me.

322
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:47,534
You want something for
the baby to be proud,

323
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,824
you have to do it now.

324
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,661
Make it up there.

325
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:57,158
You have to make it!

326
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,123
The music box?

327
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:27,948
Koy...

328
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:30,199
You go ahead, I'll be behind you. Hurry up.

329
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,035
Are you alright?

330
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:49,917
Day.

331
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,283
How many days haven't
you had Insulin shots?

332
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:02,993
I lose count.

333
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,331
You gotta be alright.

334
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:10,705
I remember...

335
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:14,748
There is one shot up there.

336
00:57:58,875 --> 00:57:59,875
Baby.

337
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,458
Baby.

338
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,208
Baby.

339
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,208
Our baby...

340
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:17,708
Day.

341
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:19,958
Baby.

342
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Baby.

343
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,750
Baby.

344
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:34,292
Baby.

345
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:37,955
- Day.
- Baby.

346
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:42,656
Damn it, day!

347
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,828
You leave stuff everywhere!

348
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,073
I'm okay.

349
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:52,542
Koy.

350
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,208
I'm okay.

351
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:57,865
I'm okay.

352
00:58:58,417 --> 00:58:59,497
I'm okay.

353
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:04,413
I'm okay.

354
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,583
I'm okay.

355
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,453
An addict you are.

356
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,411
Help!

357
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:09,040
Help! We are stuck in here!

358
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,500
Koy.

359
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:25,990
Wait for me here.

360
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:27,368
There must be some way.

361
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,333
Come here.

362
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,497
Koy. Koy.

363
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:31,583
Day.

364
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Day.

365
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:37,042
Koy.

366
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:39,494
Cover the hole with this barrel.

367
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,910
So nothing can come through.

368
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,698
It's safer in here.

369
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:00,955
Help!

370
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:08,247
Just a kid's toy?

371
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:16,748
Help!

372
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:20,369
Help!

373
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,573
Does anyone hear me?

374
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:23,789
Help!

375
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,456
Anybody help!

376
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,161
Does anyone hear me?

377
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:41,249
Help!

378
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:07,375
Go!

379
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:08,625
Go!

380
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Day.

381
01:05:58,792 --> 01:05:59,792
Day.

382
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:02,542
Day.

383
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,500
Day.

384
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:09,833
Koy.

385
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:07,123
Koy, stay with me.

386
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:09,205
I will...

387
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:12,158
Go to the other end of the tunnel.

388
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:16,369
Let's see where it leads me to.

389
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,660
Wait for me here, koy.

390
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:41,624
No!

391
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:44,082
No!

392
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,582
No! No! No!

393
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:11,368
I told you.

394
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,160
Enough, just go home.

395
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,250
It's raining.

396
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:15,822
Look.

397
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:16,958
Come on,

398
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,618
it should be somewhere here.

399
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,869
Will my motorbike get stolen?

400
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,125
Hey.

401
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,323
What's that? Looks creepy.

402
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:29,199
There it is, our glider.

403
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:30,667
You go get it.

404
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:31,997
Hey.

405
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,250
Let's go together.

406
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,250
How?

407
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:38,667
Should we jump?

408
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:42,122
Look.

409
01:11:58,917 --> 01:11:59,952
So deep.

410
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:01,907
You can't wait now? Genius.

411
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:02,917
Come on.

412
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:05,833
Pick it up.

413
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,414
Did someone die here?

414
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:15,833
What the hell?

415
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,331
Let's go. It's gonna rain.

416
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,198
Who did that?

417
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,241
Could be a commercial production.

418
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:24,123
None of our business. Let's go.

419
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:25,331
Don't waste our time.

420
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,333
Come on.

421
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,573
They must have left it.

422
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,164
It's soaking wet.

423
01:12:31,875 --> 01:12:33,160
What's your problem?

424
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:34,667
Come on.

425
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,365
- Ready?
- Wait.

426
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:45,247
Ready?

427
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:46,375
Yeah.

428
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:52,042
Where is the step?

429
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,490
Hold it tight. Let me go up.

430
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,245
Hey, moron! I might fall off.

431
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,365
I'm going up now.

432
01:13:05,917 --> 01:13:07,373
- Ready?
- Wait.

433
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:16,208
Help...

434
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,333
Help.

435
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,250
Help...

436
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:24,614
Help...

437
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:25,708
Help us...

438
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:27,618
Help...

439
01:13:30,917 --> 01:13:31,917
Help...

440
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,157
Day.

441
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:03,667
Day.

442
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:14,743
No. Lucky!

443
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:15,875
No!

444
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:13,288
Koy.

445
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:14,375
Koy!

446
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:16,833
Koy!

447
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:18,875
Koy!

448
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:02,910
Wake up, koy!

449
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:04,657
Wake up, koy!

450
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:08,833
Koy.

451
01:24:10,708 --> 01:24:12,198
Koy, can you hear me?

452
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:13,823
Wake up, koy.

453
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:14,833
Wake up.

454
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:19,577
I'm back to you.

455
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,240
You hear me, koy?

456
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,910
Wake up, koy!

457
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,118
Wake up!

458
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:28,491
Wake up! Can you hear me?

459
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:29,622
Koy!

460
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:30,660
Wake up!

461
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:37,458
Wake up...

462
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:39,833
Wake up.

463
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,167
Koy.

464
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,875
Koy.

465
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,072
Koy.

466
01:25:22,167 --> 01:25:23,167
Koy.

467
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:25,208
Koy.

468
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:26,542
Koy.

469
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:27,833
Day.

470
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Koy.

471
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,500
Come here.
