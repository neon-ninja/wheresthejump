1
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,755
The New South Wales government

2
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,515
has unveiled a radical solution
to the water crisis.

3
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:48,715
It plans to tap into an abandoned
reservoir under the city.

4
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:51,235
$95 million will be spent

5
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:55,755
on a state-of-the-art water recycling
facility in the heart of Sydney.

6
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,595
My name is Natasha Warner

7
00:04:57,605 --> 00:05:01,555
and I've worked in news and
current affairs for well over 10 years.

8
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:03,875
I knew that I wanted to tell stories.

9
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,435
I knew I wanted to communicate to the public

10
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:10,155
and, um, that looked like
the perfect place for me.

11
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:13,435
The NSW Minister for Water and the Environment

12
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:17,035
has been under sustained fire for 12 months now.

13
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:20,395
Sydney's water reserves are at an all-time low.

14
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:23,595
We are a progressive government
and in the face of climate change

15
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:26,995
we need to look at all possibilities,
and recycling water

16
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,476
is definitely the way of the future.

17
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:31,795
I first came across a story which was
focusing on the government

18
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:34,156
that had just announced
some water recycling plans

19
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,195
and they wanted to use
abandoned underground tunnels

20
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:41,395
in one of our biggest rail systems.

21
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:44,155
Thousands of people pass through here each day

22
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:47,795
not realising the state government's
solution to the water crisis

23
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,435
is beneath their feet.

24
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:52,195
The plan is to build recycling infrastructure

25
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:57,715
to make use of millions of litres of water
trapped in disused train tunnels.

26
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,436
I didn't realise how vast they were.

27
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:03,875
There's virtually a whole other city
underneath us.

28
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:07,195
Welfare groups say the tunnels
are a refuge for Sydney's homeless.

29
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:09,476
Building underground
water recycling infrastructure

30
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:12,233
would leave them with nowhere to go.

31
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,955
The new homeless concerns
are likely to cause another road block

32
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:19,076
for the government's water crisis solution.

33
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,995
In a similar scenario in the US,

34
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:23,555
hundreds of homeless

35
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,795
were recently evicted from underground tunnels.

36
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,275
It caused a public relations nightmare.

37
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:30,395
You can quickly see why the government's

38
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,356
having so much trouble evicting the homeless.

39
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,915
I mean, trying to navigate through

40
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,915
this maze of dark tunnels is hard.

41
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,995
Trying to find people hiding in here

42
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:41,435
is virtually impossible.

43
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:43,396
The Water and Environment minister says

44
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:47,555
there is no evidence
of anyone living in Sydney's tunnels.

45
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:51,678
He says if Labor wins the election,
the water solution will proceed.

46
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,595
After the initial fanfare the story dried up

47
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:59,435
It was like the whole thing never happened.

48
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:03,955
That's when alarm bells went off in
my head. Things just don't disappear.

49
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,475
Whenever something's not
spoken about, I've got to ask why.

50
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:09,755
It's my job as a journalist.

51
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,955
Cheers, John. Happy birthday.

52
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,835
My birthday

53
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:25,115
What's your birthday message?

54
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,271
What do you have to say?
Uh, John

55
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,595
Actually, I can tell you a story about John.

56
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:35,555
You guys may not know this one,
it was way back in 1991.

57
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:38,955
My name's Steve Miller,
I'm a TV cameraman.

58
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:42,795
I've been working in news
and current affairs since the mid-'80s.

59
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:45,995
Me and Pete had just started,
and they sent us to the first Gulf War.

60
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:47,836
So we had to phone home to the office,

61
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,836
to John, who was the news director at the time,

62
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:51,395
and said, "Send us more cash.

63
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,995
"We need to get some gas masks
and chemical suits and stuff."

64
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,035
So they sent us, like, 10 grand.

65
00:07:57,045 --> 00:08:00,875
We've got this cash in our hand, we've
gone, "Fuck it, let's spend it on piss!"

66
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:04,315
And the air raid sirens, everyone else
is fucking pulling on their masks,

67
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:07,437
and we're just going, "Oh, fuck it."

68
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,955
You kind of get married to the job,
so the people you work with,

69
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:14,715
they end up becoming like family members.

70
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,195
You've met our soundo.

71
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:20,435
He's an incredibly handsome young
man, but he's not very good at his job.

72
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:22,755
Come here, Tangles.
What're you talking about?

73
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:25,475
I'm talking about the time in the States we went

74
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:27,236
Two weeks you went without headphones.

75
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:28,715
Remember that?

76
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,995
And did anyone notice?
No-one noticed!

77
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,155
He's a genius.
That's how good I am.

78
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:36,240
I don't even need to hear it,
I feel it on the knobs.

79
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,076
When you get that gang on the road,

80
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,315
when you get Steve and Tangles out on a shoot,

81
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,075
they're just

82
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:46,595
They're professional,
but they're also kids.

83
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:51,674
At the end of the day they like to
muck around and have a bit of a laugh.

84
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,755
I remember Natasha,
she was at another network

85
00:08:57,765 --> 00:09:01,795
and then a couple of years later
they brought her across to us.

86
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:04,355
First impression?

87
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:07,475
Just another young person coming in

88
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,555
getting paid too much money,
hadn't really proved herself.

89
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:12,755
But, you know,
she was the next big thing.

90
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,435
Hey, Pete! Pete!

91
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,915
A business meeting?

92
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:18,715
Production meeting.
Production meeting.

93
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,476
Talking about producing some, uh

94
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:23,560
.. sea-man.

95
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,312
Well, yeah...produ

96
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,558
How's that? You'd better turn that off soon.

97
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,155
Pete!
Pete!

98
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:42,035
Hey?
The one that got away!

99
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,276
I'm not away, I'm here.
Haven't we done that story before?

100
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:46,435
Come in here, mate.

101
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:50,155
Pete and I, we had
an interesting working relationship.

102
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:54,675
He was very determined
in the way he would do his job

103
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:57,195
and I was very determined in the way
I would do mine.

104
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,355
Sometimes that would work well together,

105
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,915
and sometimes it would
sort of cause a bit of friction.

106
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:07,275
Whenever her name came up,
the subject was changed pretty quickly.

107
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,515
When you think back on it now,
you sort of go,

108
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,353
"Oh, yeah, there was something going on there."

109
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,835
I came across a YouTube video
which showed some youths

110
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:31,115
defacing and vandalising
areas around the tunnels.

111
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:35,195
Sef? Did you do this?

112
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:37,475
You are fucking kidding me!

113
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,116
Fucking teach them a lesson, then, eh?

114
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:40,595
I fucking will.

115
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:43,195
This is what I think of your shit, MK.

116
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:46,075
Within that clip itself

117
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,235
there was something unknown.

118
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:51,640
Quite clearly, though, there was
something there in the tunnel.

119
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,595
Fuck was that?

120
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,515
Shh... Shh

121
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,112
What was that?
Shut up.

122
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,113
Fuck, what the fuck was that?

123
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,753
They're still here.

124
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,075
Oi!

125
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,476
Give me the torch...
Sef, come on, let's get out of here.

126
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:13,076
Just fucking give me the torch, you bitch!

127
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,235
No, don't! Come on!
It's cool, it's fucking cool. Oi!

128
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:18,755
Think you can tag on my fuckin' work, do ya?

129
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,236
Fuck, Sef, come on.
We've gotta fucking

130
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,715
Fuck.

131
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:24,920
Sef!
Sef?

132
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,790
Sef? What the hell, Sef? Come on!

133
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,395
Hold on. Sef, ANSWER ME!

134
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:37,275
Sef!
Fuck this. I'm out of here.

135
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:39,196
Dez, hold on. Don't go anywhere. Wait.

136
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:41,635
J, come on!
Dez, stop!

137
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:44,995
Dez, don't rack off!
What the fuck are you doing? Help!

138
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:49,640
Sef? Sef, answer me, please!

139
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,915
Once I saw that clip, I thought,
"This is a story I can go to John with."

140
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,955
You know,
"Finally it's got some strength."

141
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:06,635
Since when does a decent journalist
use YouTube as research?

142
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:10,475
It was a good clip, but at the time
I thought, "She's crazy."

143
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:14,715
When I pitched the story to John,
he put Pete on this.

144
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,955
What that meant was

145
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:19,435
Pete had an upcoming job and story in China

146
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:22,435
which he was very,
very passionate about.

147
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:25,989
And I had to give him the news
that he was taken off the story.

148
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,355
I first heard about the tunnels
being a potential story for us

149
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:42,155
just as we were prepping up
actually to go to China, with Pete.

150
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:44,596
Hey, mate, there's a focus chart there somewhere.

151
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,996
Can you just hold it up for us?
Yeah, yeah. No worries.

152
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:48,475
Beauty.

153
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:50,515
He'd been working on this thing for a long time

154
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:54,155
and he was pretty pumped
to get over there and get stuck into it.

155
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,235
I think he had some pretty good leads,

156
00:12:56,245 --> 00:13:00,155
which could have blown
his career wide open... it was great.

157
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:02,355
How's it look, mate?
Mate, it looks pretty good.

158
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,276
It ought to, the amount the repairs cost.

159
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,715
Thanks, Tangles. Nice one.

160
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:08,556
No more throwing cameras around stairwells.

161
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:11,675
Yeah, I told you guys it's not my fault, alright?

162
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:16,235
Hey, um, you happy to go handheld?
The lighter we go, the quicker we move.

163
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,835
Absolutely, mate.
We 're going to China after all.

164
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:21,640
More room for cheap DVDs,
pirated software

165
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,595
You're all class, mate.

166
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,875
It was purely John's decision
to put Pete on this story.

167
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:31,875
Well, I was a little uncomfortable
with having Pete there to start with.

168
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:35,475
Like I said before,
we weren't exactly always gelling.

169
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,876
I was really nervous about talking to Pete.

170
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:44,552
I didn't wanna tell him.

171
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,275
It's not that exciting,

172
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:06,835
when you're building your hopes up
for this great big story

173
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,956
and then you sort of get given a shit sandwich.

174
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,075
I thought at that point
I was doing the right thing.

175
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:18,435
I thought that Pete having to postpone
what he had planned

176
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:20,476
was worth it in the end for the story.

177
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,555
He did say he went in to see John.

178
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:31,035
I don't know what happened in that room,

179
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,595
and the contents of that conversation

180
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,555
but, yeah, he had spoken to John about it,

181
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:39,555
and I think it was from that point on

182
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:42,950
it was clear he wasn't going to China
and Nat had won the day.

183
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,316
Why did John go the other way?

184
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,075
C'mon. We all know why John was favouring Nat.

185
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,513
Eh?

186
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,275
Once Peter was on the story
we started attending the daily pressers

187
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:20,195
to try and find out what happened
to the water recycling plans.

188
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,676
Pete was pissed off,
but, you know, Pete's a pro.

189
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,676
Took him a day or two,
then he came round

190
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:27,035
just like the guy he is.

191
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:30,835
He started to do his own searching around

192
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:33,195
He had contacts in the council who he spoke to.

193
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,156
And some rumours started to surface

194
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,715
that not only were there
homeless living in the tunnels,

195
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:39,915
but there were homeless that were going missing.

196
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,675
You know, at that point
we slowly started to think

197
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,355
there may be something in this.

198
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,355
So we just started

199
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:48,749
by chasing the then water minister.

200
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,875
The main thing that was apparent

201
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,474
That he was staying quiet on the topic.

202
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,235
He wouldn't talk to us...
no-one would talk to us.

203
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,475
At that point, we were just getting stonewalled.

204
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,955
If it was true that homeless were going missing,

205
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:05,115
this was a big story.

206
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,997
And it was a really important one.

207
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,515
Where is he?
Through here.

208
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,995
Minister!

209
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,075
Minister, have you seen the report about
the homeless people in the tunnels?

210
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,875
Nothing to say at the moment.

211
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,516
Have you scrapped your plans because
people are going missing in the tunnels?

212
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:22,595
No comment. No comment.

213
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,316
Minister, should people be worried?

214
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:26,231
Is there a threat in the underground tunnels?

215
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,435
Well?

216
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:38,955
Alright... that was alright.
You reckon?

217
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,755
I knew we wouldn't get anything.

218
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:44,835
I think that definitely on quite a large scale

219
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,676
there was a lot of people in the government

220
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,156
that knew what was going on.

221
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,116
They knew what was going on down there.

222
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:53,035
You know, with everything
that's happened subsequently,

223
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,712
they were hiding stuff.

224
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,475
I started getting in contact with
a few of the shelters around the city,

225
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,995
and eventually I came across
one particular homeless man

226
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:15,995
who I had believed
had been living in the tunnels.

227
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,675
So this was...
I mean, this was fantastic.

228
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:21,752
We had, finally, someone to speak to.

229
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,155
Right, Trevor, just one sec.
I've gotta fix your mike, if that's OK.

230
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,475
I'm not sure how she found Trevor,
but Natasha found Trevor.

231
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:41,000
We went down to this home,
and we sat him down for an interview.

232
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,035
Yeah, sweet.

233
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:47,600
Alright, mate. This will be fun.
You'll be on telly.

234
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,915
Alright, guys, I'm sweet.

235
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:53,076
Trevor, if you don't feel
comfortable with anything

236
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:55,155
you let me know at any time.

237
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:58,475
And, um, when I'm asking you the questions,

238
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:02,195
if you're not quite sure of an answer, that's OK

239
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,476
We can fix it up later,
so don't worry about that.

240
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,715
Good.
Yeah? Thank you.

241
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:10,875
Well, the interview with Trevor was a tricky one

242
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:13,755
but something that I am, I guess,

243
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:16,195
always quite accustomed to dealing with.

244
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:19,035
Trevor, I understand you've been living it rough

245
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:20,473
Call me Trev.

246
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,351
Trev? OK.

247
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,475
Trev, I understand you've been living it
rough for quite some time now.

248
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:31,435
What circumstances took you
to living in the tunnels?

249
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:37,075
Uh... Well, it kept me and my mates
warm in the winter. Yeah.

250
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:40,195
It all started out great,
chatting away to him.

251
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:44,435
He started to tell me a little bit about,
you know, his circumstances,

252
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,595
what led him to live in the tunnels.

253
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:50,435
He started to really paint a picture
of what it was like there.

254
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,475
And amongst your friends,
Alfie and Johnny and Harry

255
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:55,315
and some of the others,

256
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,959
do they still live down there... now?

257
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,275
No.

258
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,315
Trev?

259
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:11,275
Hmm.
Are you OK? You comfortable?

260
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:14,397
Hmm. Yeah.

261
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,595
At that point in the interview,
I asked Trevor

262
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:21,475
what he perhaps had been through in the tunnels.

263
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:24,355
I asked Trevor what he had seen.

264
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:27,511
Clearly something had happened to him.

265
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,915
Trevor, did you know someone who went missing?

266
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,594
Trevor, did anything happen to you down there?

267
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,599
Trevor

268
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,233
.. are you alright?

269
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,515
NO!

270
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,273
Shit.

271
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,875
Did you get that before?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

272
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:23,871
Oh, my God

273
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,433
Crazy.
I know.

274
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,755
After Trevor's interview, it was clear
we were onto something.

275
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,795
All the pieces of the puzzle were
symptoms of something deeper,

276
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,315
I just didn't know what.

277
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:40,235
I needed more.

278
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:42,435
We needed to get down there.

279
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,595
Your call may be recorded for training purposes.

280
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:53,798
Please advise your operator if you
do not wish your call to be recorded.

281
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,235
Hello, this is Pam.

282
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:06,436
Oh, hi, Pam, it's Natasha Warner here.
How are you?

283
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:09,755
I'm well, Nat, and you?
Yeah, good, good, thanks.

284
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,755
Look, I'm just wondering if you can help me out.

285
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:15,195
I'm working on a story and I need
to get into the tunnels under the CBD.

286
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,435
Who do I need to talk to to make that happen?

287
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:19,875
Right. What's the story?

288
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:22,235
Oh, look, I just need half an hour.

289
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:24,470
Um...just hang on a sec

290
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,715
Nat, sorry... I can't help you this time.

291
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,195
What?

292
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:34,836
Apparently no-one's getting in there,

293
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:36,956
and I don't think you'll be getting
any special treatment.

294
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,515
C'mon, Pam, it's me.

295
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:42,910
Exactly. And people got burnt
last time. I can't do it.

296
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,755
I really need this.
Look, Pam, can you help me out?

297
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm sorry, Nat.'Bye.
Look, I just need half

298
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,515
I guess it's easier to look at it now

299
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:02,675
and say that I was perhaps under
a lot of pressure to get this story.

300
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:06,995
At the time I just...
I felt I was doing my job.

301
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,195
I was so focused on just doing my job.

302
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:11,195
There was a lot of rumours kicking around

303
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,235
she was in big trouble, and she
kind of really needed to lift her game

304
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,958
otherwise she was gone.

305
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,995
Well, I think that I'd put
a lot of work into my career

306
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,198
and I think it was all basically
hanging on this one...one story.

307
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,715
You know, I didn't really have a choice.

308
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:30,115
Hey, Tangles,
how's your head, mate?

309
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,635
Pete, I'm like a fucking shark.
As long as I keep moving, I'll be OK.

310
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,476
Here we go... this is what you looked like

311
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,436
after Steve pulled you out of the loo last night.

312
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,635
Oh, Steve, new toy.

313
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:44,075
Mate, waterproof, baby! A TG!
All the gear, yeah.

314
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:45,596
Good at spending the network's money.

315
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:47,956
It's not just water-resistant,
it's fully waterproof?

316
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,435
Yeah, waterproof, mate.

317
00:22:49,445 --> 00:22:53,515
Yeah, can you roll up for me?
I'll, uh, give it a bit of sound. There it is.

318
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,635
Sure, mate.
Sweet.

319
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:57,755
Rolling.
Uh, great.

320
00:22:57,765 --> 00:23:01,515
Pete, I'll just get you to say some shit.

321
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,875
Hang on...
One, two.

322
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,915
Here, mate, just say some shit to that.
"Some shit to that."

323
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:10,435
Um, yes, very excited to be
going down the smelly sewers

324
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,915
Hello. How'd you go?

325
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:16,435
Haven't got all the permits sorted
but, um, John's got us covered, OK?

326
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:19,755
When Natasha said that John was covering us

327
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,995
and we didn't have permits

328
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:24,155
That's kind of a pretty loose arrangement,

329
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:27,635
you know, you just sort of sit there
and go, "Oh, well, we must be fine."

330
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,073
You sure?
Yeah.

331
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,835
When?
We're on for tonight.

332
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,395
Tonight? OK. So we are up?
Yeah, mate.

333
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:38,555
Yep, tonight. You good?
Yeah, sweet. Yeah, I'm good, man.

334
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:41,715
Alright.
The sooner we go, the better, hey?

335
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:43,199
Yep.

336
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,435
As a crew, it's... it's our job
to film it and get coverage.

337
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:51,273
It's really not our job to question it.

338
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,835
Hey, Pete, just hang back. I'm just
gonna get a shot of Nat walking in.

339
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:09,835
Yeah? OK.

340
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:13,635
Excuse me, guys?
Guys... Hold up, restricted area.

341
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,795
Oh, sorry, mate.
Maybe no-one told you.

342
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:19,035
We're just gonna be filming for about
half an hour. We'll be out of your hair.

343
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,235
Just grabbing a few shots...
I'll need to see a permit.

344
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,077
Permit?
Yeah, uh

345
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,760
You got a permit?
I've got a driver's license.

346
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,955
Pete... how much have you got in your wallet?

347
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:42,393
You're kidding me, aren't you?

348
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,675
We're not third world here,
it's not gonna work.

349
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,635
Guys? Everyone, time to leave, please.

350
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,115
Told you.
Fucking hell.

351
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,678
Let's go, come on.

352
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,874
I was that far into it
I couldn't go back at that point.

353
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,755
We decided to find another way in,

354
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:34,231
with or without official...assistance.

355
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,835
We found some access round the other side.

356
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:55,594
Yeah, it looked like a maintenance access.

357
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,309
You sure John's got this sorted?
Grow some balls, Pete.

358
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,155
I, at that point,
was starting to feel as though

359
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:15,916
there was something not quite right.

360
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:20,755
Um, so I thought,
to cover myself and to cover Tangles,

361
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:22,875
and really to cover all of us,

362
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:25,356
I'd just film pretty much everything
that was happening there.

363
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,355
You know, I thought we had to have

364
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:29,156
some sort of way of protecting ourselves,

365
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,075
should something go wrong.

366
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:34,035
You know, if we got busted
and fined or whatever, arrested,

367
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:37,515
um, you know, I had some evidence it wasn't me

368
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:40,035
trying to push us down there,
and it wasn't Tangles,

369
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,917
but it was Natasha.

370
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,996
Here... take this.

371
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,229
Here we go.

372
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,193
OK, let's go.

373
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,476
You right? You want me to...
Take this.

374
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:03,515
Yep.

375
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,953
OK, make it quick.

376
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,155
We just were kind of covering
our tracks as we went down

377
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:30,957
You know, we didn't want to get discovered.

378
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,156
Looking back on that

379
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,074
.. that was probably a mistake.

380
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,155
We OK?
Hey?

381
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:44,835
Are we OK to be down here?

382
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:46,910
That's what she said.
She said John's got us covered.

383
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,795
When we start filming a story

384
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,875
When we actually start
"OK, let's get it, let's roll"

385
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:15,675
Pete and Natasha,
they look after the editorial content,

386
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:19,915
and, you know, it's kind of
my job to take over there

387
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:21,555
and look after the pictures.

388
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:24,795
OK, turn around and come back.
I'll just get you walking past this grill.

389
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:26,597
You guys just hang back there for a second.

390
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,875
Tangles and I would go off and we'd just start

391
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,515
getting stuck into it,
filming like we always would.

392
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:40,637
You know, don't really need direction,
we'd just get into it.

393
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,875
Once we got in sort of a little bit further,
there were whole sections of tunnels

394
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:54,315
that were absolutely,
absolutely pitch black.

395
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:57,835
It is completely black down there.

396
00:28:57,845 --> 00:29:01,475
You know, you could go in there,
turn the light off, spin around

397
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:03,276
and you wouldn't know where you were.

398
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:06,115
'Cause there's junctions,
tunnels going off everywhere.

399
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,595
So I kind of thought

400
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:10,235
The first time I turned off the light
and stood there, I thought

401
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:13,755
we're gonna have to keep the light on
and stay across where we are

402
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:16,433
'cause otherwise it's going to be
pretty easy to get lost down there.

403
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,790
Hey, Tangles?
Yeah?

404
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,275
Just come here, mate.

405
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,516
There's something wrong with
my light. Can you check it out?

406
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,116
What do you mean?
Is it the connection?

407
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,915
Yeah, can you look in real close?
Is there something stuck on it?

408
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,395
Ah, shit!

409
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:31,040
How did I not see that coming?

410
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,511
Thanks for that, Steve.
My eyes are stuffed.

411
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,315
Great.
Let's go.

412
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:40,916
Pete had sourced a map of the tunnels,

413
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:44,595
but the further we got in, the more
we realised it wasn't exactly accurate.

414
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:47,910
There were whole sections of tunnels
that weren't even on the map.

415
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,157
Just give us some light here, Steve.

416
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,152
OK. So that's the entrance,
that's where we came down before

417
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,835
That's that way. That's not here...
I don't know why that is.

418
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:08,395
OK, through here.

419
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:11,275
Yep. That must be the way.

420
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:14,235
Once we got through
and past the maintenance areas

421
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,755
and we got into a little bit more
of the guts of the tunnels,

422
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:20,355
my impressions were that...that it was amazing.

423
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,755
It was vast, this place was huge.

424
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:25,675
That's awesome.

425
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:28,274
Shit, the sound's great.

426
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,155
Pete? Can I have 10 minutes
to grab some overlay here?

427
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,635
I'll give you five.

428
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:36,115
Five?
Yep.

429
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,635
We were very close to the station there, so, um,

430
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:42,838
you know, Pete was trying
to make us pretty low-key.

431
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,231
I was blown away by the size of it...
it was massive, and just eerie.

432
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,590
You know, I think we were all in awe of it.

433
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,315
It wasn't really difficult to get
great-looking shots down there,

434
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:22,915
you know, 'cause you're really just
painting stuff with your light

435
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,559
and whatever you saw there just was...
it looked really cool.

436
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,348
This is looking really good.
Hey, guys, just hush for a sec.

437
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,470
Alright, looks good. Yeah, sweet.

438
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,755
The history to these tunnels, the ones
in particular that we were looking at,

439
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:11,515
was just incredible.

440
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:14,355
I mean, it dates back pre-World War II.

441
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:19,035
They were to be used as
an underground rail system.

442
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,112
Then in World War II
they were used as air raid shelters.

443
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,198
Come have a look at this.

444
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,555
The current NSW government

445
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:39,315
is not the first to use these
tunnels for another purpose.

446
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,116
I'm standing in a section of tunnel

447
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,075
that was converted into an
air raid shelter during World War ll.

448
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:47,275
It's complete with all the amenities

449
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:50,158
that enabled soldiers to stay
for extended periods.

450
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,715
Various rooms were then, um,

451
00:32:55,725 --> 00:33:00,435
reused and fashioned for training for the SAS.

452
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:04,635
So time and time again they've,
I guess, been reinvented for their use,

453
00:33:04,645 --> 00:33:08,189
and even to this day with the water
recycling plans that were announced.

454
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,316
I was fortunate enough to
come across an area where

455
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:22,555
it was evident that there was definitely,
you know, homeless

456
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:24,675
or, you know, people living down there.

457
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:27,069
That's good...good just here.

458
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,874
I'm right to go?
Hang on a sec.

459
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,753
Go when you're ready.

460
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,435
We've been walking in
the tunnel for less than an hour,

461
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:40,155
and already we've come across somebody's home.

462
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:44,355
Here you can see their makeshift bed, blanket

463
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:46,075
and empty tins of food.

464
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:49,595
Coming across the belongings was very important

465
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:51,355
It was vital to the story.

466
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:55,435
It was absolute proof
that there was life down here.

467
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:57,876
While there is no sign of
an occupant at the moment,

468
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:03,235
it is clear the minister's assertions
of abandoned tunnels are incorrect.

469
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:05,436
This was something that
the government were denying.

470
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:08,352
This is something that we could now prove.

471
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,235
Hey, Nat, I'll get a shot of you
going down there, actually.

472
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:14,715
Yeah, cool.

473
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,595
Oh, hey. Light.

474
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:19,192
Cheers.

475
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,555
Mate, what's up?
What? Nothing.

476
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:35,358
It's a bit tight down there, tubby.
You reckon you're gonna make it?

477
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,240
He mustn't like working on the show.

478
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,196
Nat! You alright?
Nat, you alright?

479
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,316
Yeah, I'm right.

480
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:44,197
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm fine.

481
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,035
Nat? Look, we've already
got the sleeping bags and stuff,

482
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:51,636
we don't really need to get the lake.

483
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:53,876
We could probably do the rest up here.
Pete... Pete, I'm alright.

484
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,716
I just think it's a little...
I'm fine!

485
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,153
Just let's keep going.

486
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,595
Alright, you take that.
Yeah.

487
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:03,795
What's eating her?
Oh, she just really needs the story.

488
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:06,355
After what happened last time,
she's treading on thin ice.

489
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,875
Yeah, I reckon.

490
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:10,675
That's why John put me onto this...
make sure she doesn't fuck up again.

491
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:13,315
If she's not up to it,
why doesn't he give her the arse?

492
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,995
Mate, I think John'd wanna
give her a little more than just that.

493
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,236
Well, he'd have to get in line
behind you, wouldn't he?

494
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:21,555
Hey, guys, you might
wanna know for future reference

495
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,555
that these tunnels carry sound pretty well.

496
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:26,680
And as far as I can hear,
you're all arseholes.

497
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,955
Fuck off!

498
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:33,474
Yeah, give me the torch.
Right, yeah, hang on.

499
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,437
There you go, mate.

500
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,235
Get down there, you arsehole.

501
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:45,312
Pete, can you just lift that handle up
for me? Get a bit of sound.

502
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,320
Where to? Just

503
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,795
Yeah, nice.
Give it a kick.

504
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:57,955
Yeah, give it a kick.
Send it on its way.

505
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:00,275
What are we doing?
Just...just give it a kick.

506
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,157
You call it.

507
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

508
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,038
Thanks, guys.

509
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,915
The lake was just...so...vast.

510
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:43,275
I mean, this thing runs a kilometre long.

511
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,998
It's bigger than I thought.

512
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,560
Yeah, I get that a lot.

513
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,636
Me and Tangles were mucking around a bit

514
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:54,035
We like to play jokes on each other.

515
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,195
You know, if I didn't do it,
he would've done it.

516
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:59,036
So I just grabbed him and sort of went

517
00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:01,036
.. you know, at the edge of the lake,
went to push him in.

518
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:03,036
You know how you go up,
hold onto their shoulders

519
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,516
and pull them back again?

520
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:08,115
Which I did, and then I let go of him,
and went to walk back to the camera

521
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,600
In he went.

522
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,915
Shit.
Tangles, are you right?

523
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:16,835
Yeah, slipped.
There's your dip, mate.

524
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:18,675
Steve, you...prick.

525
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:21,195
Oi, this is not funny. It's fucking cold.

526
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,440
Are you gonna give him a hand?
No, fuck him!

527
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,195
This is not... Stop laughing, OK?

528
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:32,235
How long are we gonna be down here, alright?

529
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:35,955
Tangles, as much as we used to
joke around and muck around together,

530
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,995
when it came time to work,
you know, he was very serious,

531
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:41,435
and it wasn't time for joking.

532
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:44,155
Creative department's ready.
Just letting you know.

533
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:45,115
OK.

534
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,955
Nat, just come forward a fraction.

535
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:51,955
So, you know, when he's sort of
giving me the impression

536
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:54,315
that there were problems,
I was believing him.

537
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:58,315
I'm standing directly below
one of Sydney's busiest train stations.

538
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:00,915
Behind me is the forgotten water resource

539
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,195
that's causing all the controversy.

540
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:04,796
Earlier this year the government

541
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:07,555
Nat, sorry. Pete, are you making noise?
No.

542
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:09,755
You weren't whispering?
No.

543
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,636
Alright. Sorry, Nat.
Can we go from the top?

544
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:14,631
Everyone, just keep it quiet. Thank you.

545
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,755
OK, let's go from the top again.
Let's move.

546
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,193
When you're ready, Nat.

547
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,635
I'm standing directly below one of
Sydney's busiest train stations.

548
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:29,955
Behind me is the forgotten water resource

549
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:32,635
Nat, sorry. Are you guys
fucking with me? What's the noise?

550
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,715
What are you hearing, mate?

551
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:36,711
It's... Hang on, I'll just check the battery.

552
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,315
Sweet, um, I don't know.

553
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:42,915
Maybe it's your cables.
Yeah, cables don't fucking talk, Steve.

554
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:45,795
Uh, alright. Sorry, Nat.
Go for it again, I'll see what I can do.

555
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:47,233
Just go straight through.

556
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,918
If Tangles says he heard something,
I do believe he felt he heard something.

557
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,635
I can't describe how silent the place was,

558
00:38:57,645 --> 00:39:01,918
so at the time I didn't feel that...
he could have been hearing anything.

559
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,115
It...it was strange.

560
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:10,155
I was just thinking, you know,
it could have been a technical problem,

561
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:14,675
could have been anything... some
RF interference, anything like that.

562
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,835
But, you know, Tangles was adamant
there was something going on,

563
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:23,709
and, uh, when he's serious about
something, you know, you believe him.

564
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,235
Earlier this year,
the government announced,

565
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:30,835
then quietly abandoned,
plans to recycle water from this lake.

566
00:39:30,845 --> 00:39:33,991
The Minister for Water
has yet to give a reason why.

567
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,157
Beautiful. Pete, happy?
I'm happy. How are you, Tangles?

568
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,835
Oh...yeah. Yeah, sweet, yeah.

569
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:46,877
Alright, let's go.
Let's move, grab the sticks.

570
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,593
Alright, let's go.

571
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,799
After we'd finished our piece at the lake, um,

572
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,673
we decided to head for the bell room.

573
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,155
Righto, Nat.

574
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:08,555
Basically the bell room was built as like
a air raid sort of alert back in the war.

575
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:11,438
They would use it to warn people of danger.

576
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,835
When we rang the bell,
it...it was deafening.

577
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:18,995
It rattled your ribs.

578
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:21,675
This bell is a relic of World War ll.

579
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,715
It remains here in the confines
of an air raid shelter,

580
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:27,632
as a reminder of what
imminent danger sounds like.

581
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,515
Shit, that blew my levels
right off the meter, sorry. Um

582
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:39,115
Hang on. Nat, can you just
hit the bell once more?

583
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,872
Yep. Ready to go?
Yep.

584
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,475
How's that?

585
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,316
Nah, look, if you want me to get that,

586
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,316
it's probably best I boom it from down the hall.

587
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:53,392
Yeah, OK. Well, if we need it.
OK, cool, two seconds.

588
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,675
Tangles decided to, um, go into
the adjoining room off the bell room

589
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:01,875
and boom it from there

590
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:06,075
just to basically kill the sound
of the level of the bell,

591
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:09,795
which was just making his levels peak out.

592
00:41:09,805 --> 00:41:12,155
I don't really know much about recording sound,

593
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:16,755
but I did at the time remember
thinking, "That's a bit weird."

594
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,235
You know, why would you do that?
Just turn it down a little bit.

595
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,435
Surely it's that simple?

596
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:24,035
Uh, Steve, can you do me a favour?

597
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:26,436
Can you just listen on the cans,
watch the levels for me?

598
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:30,275
Why don't you get Pete to do it? He can
do camera, he must be able to do sound.

599
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:31,838
Nah, mate, I've done enough hard work today.

600
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,155
That's good, Nat, yeah.
I'll do it for ya, mate.

601
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,955
Sorry, guys, it's just way too echoey in here.

602
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,995
He asked me to listen to the audio for him,

603
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:45,475
which was fine.

604
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:49,155
It's just put on the headphones
and listen to it as it's being recorded.

605
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:52,516
Here, Tangles. Take that.
Thanks very much.

606
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,515
And then so Nat just went ahead and did it again,

607
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:02,830
and, uh...that's

608
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,313
That's when, uh

609
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,471
.. that's when I heard it.

610
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,715
Yeah, ready to go.

611
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:16,355
Bell atmos.

612
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:17,793
Whenever you're ready, Nat.

613
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,113
What the fuck?

614
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,992
Did you... did you hear that?
Yeah.

615
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,475
Yo, Tangles!

616
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,955
Tangles!

617
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:38,475
Shit.
Tangles!

618
00:42:38,485 --> 00:42:41,517
Pete, we need some light
down here, mate. Tangles!

619
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,315
Quick, light.
Shit. Steve, where are you?

620
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:48,156
Down here. Straight, straight, straight.

621
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,396
Just give us the camera, mate.
He's... he's gone.

622
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:52,355
Where'd he go?
Tangles!

623
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:54,156
What did you hear in the headphones?
Tangles!

624
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:55,996
What did you hear in your headphones?

625
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,475
Tangles!

626
00:42:57,485 --> 00:42:59,595
Would he be dickin' us round?

627
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:01,875
Tangles!
Tangles, come on, mate!

628
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:04,075
Steve, through here.

629
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:06,833
Tangles!
Tangles!

630
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,915
Yo, Tangles!
Here, I'll go down here.

631
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:10,915
Yeah.

632
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:12,756
You know, I knew there was something wrong.

633
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:14,635
I knew he wasn't mucking around.

634
00:43:14,645 --> 00:43:16,517
My initial thought was just to get to him.

635
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,435
It wasn't unlike them,

636
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:23,274
so I guess my first instinct was
that they were having a joke.

637
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,636
What, Nat thought we were
playing a prank, did she?

638
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,073
You've spoken to her?

639
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,759
She thought we were fucking around?

640
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,998
Tangles, you good?

641
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,152
Yep. Ready to go.

642
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,433
Bell atmos.

643
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,913
Tangles!

644
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,916
Maybe through here...
No, that's a dead end.

645
00:44:44,926 --> 00:44:46,035
Tangles!

646
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,590
Watch your step.
Tangles!

647
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,355
Ah, great.
What's up?

648
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:54,835
Battery.
You alright?

649
00:44:54,845 --> 00:44:56,316
Yeah, fuck. It's alright.

650
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,555
Need the light? You got a spare?

651
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:00,278
Yeah, it's in here, hang on.
OK.

652
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,075
It became pretty evident, quite quickly,

653
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:09,835
that we weren't gonna be able to
find anyone or anything without light.

654
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:11,478
Got it.

655
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,756
We'll get him, mate. We'll find him.
We'll find him, alright?

656
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:17,235
Tangles!

657
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:21,555
Now, I had my camera light and I knew I had about

658
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:24,955
two, maybe three hours tops worth of light.

659
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:26,436
Steve, where's your kit?
Tangles!

660
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:27,916
Steve, where's your kit?
What?

661
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:30,195
Where's your kit?
It's back in the bell room.

662
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:33,635
OK. well... all the torches
are back there, aren't they?

663
00:45:33,645 --> 00:45:35,956
This is the only light you've got
and it's fucking around.

664
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,595
We need the torches, mate.
We've gotta go back to the bell room.

665
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:39,595
But Tangles

666
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:41,436
It's alright. We'll get him.
We'll find him. C'mon.

667
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:43,317
Fuck.
C'mon.

668
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,356
Walked back into the bell room
and there was nothing.

669
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,995
There was nothing there.
All the stuff had disappeared.

670
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:51,796
Now, that was only in a matter of

671
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:53,396
I don't know, couldn't have been too long.

672
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:55,315
Shit, everything's gone.
What?

673
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:56,796
What the hell's going on?

674
00:45:56,806 --> 00:45:58,996
It certainly raised some
concern because I didn't feel

675
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,515
it was something that
Tangles could do by himself.

676
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:03,515
Fuck!

677
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:05,236
Hey, we're wasting time, guys. Let's go!

678
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:06,673
Wait.
C'mon!

679
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,035
Here, take this.
Pete!

680
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:11,598
Just give me some light, Steve.

681
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,315
OK.

682
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:18,311
OK, Tangles went through here.

683
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,276
If we follow that all the way round,

684
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:23,915
it brings us back to this room,
we can scan the whole area.

685
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:26,195
OK. So we split up and meet back here, yeah?

686
00:46:26,205 --> 00:46:28,196
No, we stick together.
That's the only light we've got.

687
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:29,676
How many batteries have you got left?

688
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,516
I've got two in my pouch, mate.
Let's go.

689
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:35,355
Steve... STEVE!
Oh, fuck!

690
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:38,395
It won't do Tangles any good
if we run round like headless cheeks.

691
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:40,115
We stick together, alright?

692
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:42,475
You'd better keep up, then.

693
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,675
Tangles!
Steve, wait!

694
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:46,432
C'mon, Nat.
Tangles!

695
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,915
Yeah, I panicked.

696
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:51,875
You know, it wasn't like
I'm trying to be a hero or anything.

697
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:55,195
You know, the smarter thing might
have been to do something else

698
00:46:55,205 --> 00:46:58,155
but it was just instinct just kicking in.

699
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:00,196
Tangles!

700
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,115
So, what do you think?
Think of what?

701
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,835
You know, Tangles,
is he dicking around?

702
00:47:07,845 --> 00:47:10,798
No, he wouldn't dick around for this long.

703
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,075
Who took our stuff, then?

704
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:16,315
Who took it? I don't know.

705
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:18,715
Could have been the homeless, junkies

706
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:21,553
I heard it, Pete.
You heard what?

707
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,998
Whatever it was, mate.
Well, what was it, mate?

708
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,035
Steve?
Look, let's just get going, OK?

709
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:34,952
Steve? Steve? What was it?

710
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,518
Shit.
Watch your step.

711
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,040
What's in here?

712
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,478
Oh, fuck.

713
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,235
You right?
Yeah.

714
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,715
Nope, nothing.

715
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:13,275
Pete, we've been here twice before, mate.

716
00:48:13,285 --> 00:48:15,555
The only other place has got to be the lake.

717
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,755
Maybe he went back from where we came.

718
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,236
Maybe he's waiting for us.

719
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:24,236
Oh, sure, mate. He's fucking
walked out in the pitch-black.

720
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,516
He's at fucking Harry's, scoffing a pie.
I don't mean that.

721
00:48:26,526 --> 00:48:28,756
I mean he can't contact us.
Maybe he's waiting for us.

722
00:48:28,766 --> 00:48:30,716
No, Steve's right, OK?
Tangles is down here.

723
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:33,075
He's got to be at the lake, mate.

724
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,952
Well, how much light have you got?
I've got enough.

725
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,715
Alright, then.

726
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:49,518
Shh! Do you hear that?
Shh.

727
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,560
Shh!

728
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,435
Let's go!
Go.

729
00:48:58,445 --> 00:49:00,235
Tangles!

730
00:49:00,245 --> 00:49:02,275
Tangles!

731
00:49:02,285 --> 00:49:04,915
This way! Tangles!

732
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:07,036
I heard him through here. Tangles!

733
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,035
Tangles! I'm coming, mate!

734
00:49:11,045 --> 00:49:13,076
Oh, fuck it!
In here!

735
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,595
Give us a hand. Quick.

736
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:18,436
Get down and grab it at the bottom.

737
00:49:18,446 --> 00:49:21,000
Fuck it! Get it off! Get it open!

738
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,635
Grab that back. Grab that.

739
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:29,315
Oh, shit. Steve, help.

740
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,675
Jesus.

741
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,678
Steve, light. Light.

742
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,518
Jesus Christ.

743
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,755
Steve...
Yeah?

744
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:05,352
His torch.

745
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,632
It's his torch,
but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.

746
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,555
I can't really describe it,
it was just

747
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,472
There was blood and

748
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,555
.. over in the corner was...Tangles's torch.

749
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:36,555
I... I sort of thought of myself
as his older brother.

750
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:39,595
You know, that was
the kind of relationship we had.

751
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:43,875
And, uh, he was sort of entrusted to me.

752
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:45,472
That's the way I felt about it.

753
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,555
Let's go.
Could be anyone.

754
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,275
C'mon. We've got to move.

755
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:59,155
She's right. He could be close, mate.
What about Tangles?

756
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:02,755
Whatever that fucking thing is,
it could be nearby.

757
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:04,239
Come on.

758
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,039
It's Tangles.
Come on.

759
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,553
Let's go.

760
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,635
Wait.
What?

761
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:20,438
Wait, where's my camera?

762
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,312
Just over there.

763
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,715
It's not where I left it.
What?

764
00:51:27,725 --> 00:51:29,153
It's not where I left it.

765
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,875
Before we entered the room Nat put the camera,

766
00:51:33,885 --> 00:51:36,155
the night vision camera, on the ground

767
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:37,995
just outside the door.

768
00:51:38,005 --> 00:51:40,675
Um...and then we went in the room.

769
00:51:40,685 --> 00:51:43,435
We wouldn't have been in there
for more than two or three minutes,

770
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:46,275
and then she came out,
we all came out together,

771
00:51:46,285 --> 00:51:48,076
and she noticed the camera had been moved.

772
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:53,473
My instinct was to check it
and see if it had recorded something.

773
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,315
Play it back.

774
00:51:58,325 --> 00:51:59,799
Tangles!

775
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,799
Tangles!

776
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,556
Get down and grab it at the bottom.

777
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:11,240
Fuck it. Get it off! Get it open!

778
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,073
Grab that back. Grab that.

779
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,555
We played back the footage and, uh,

780
00:52:41,565 --> 00:52:43,555
someone had picked up the camera,

781
00:52:43,565 --> 00:52:45,835
it had come off the ground,

782
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:48,559
and there were shots of us in the room.

783
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,749
It's his torch,
but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.

784
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,953
Let's go.

785
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,399
C'mon. We've got to move.
She's right. He could be close, mate.

786
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,512
Whatever that fucking this is,
it could be nearby.

787
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,995
It's Tangles.
Come on.

788
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:20,673
Let's go.

789
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,755
And then we turn to come out

790
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:27,915
and...the camera goes down

791
00:53:27,925 --> 00:53:30,912
and we just catch a glimpse...
it was just like one frame.

792
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,155
It happened in a split second.

793
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:40,636
I didn't know what it was, mate,

794
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:43,871
but it was quick and it was fucking frightening.

795
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,355
Fuck.

796
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,793
Oi!

797
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,113
This isn't good.

798
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,875
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out of here.

799
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:13,315
Mate, I am not fucking leaving him down here

800
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:14,796
with whatever the fuck that was.

801
00:54:14,806 --> 00:54:16,796
Steve, listen, listen to me.
I'm not fucking leaving him.

802
00:54:16,806 --> 00:54:18,796
Look, right now my priority is with you and Nat.

803
00:54:18,806 --> 00:54:21,835
I'm not going to let what happened to
Tangles happen to both of you, alright?

804
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:24,035
We have to get out to the top.

805
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:25,635
You go on your own. Leave me here.

806
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:28,275
Steve, we need your light. Come on.
You've got your own fucking light.

807
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:30,236
Listen, Steve, listen to me.
Listen to me!

808
00:54:30,246 --> 00:54:31,555
Fuck off!
Listen to me!

809
00:54:31,565 --> 00:54:33,955
I'm not done!
Don't fucking touch me, man!

810
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:36,715
Listen, listen!
Listen, listen, listen to me.

811
00:54:36,725 --> 00:54:38,395
Whatever that fucking thing is

812
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:42,393
it's going to have a harder time
taking us out if we stick together.

813
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,035
That's bullshit.
Listen. We need to get to the top.

814
00:54:48,045 --> 00:54:49,635
We need to get help.

815
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,155
If we get more help down here,

816
00:54:51,165 --> 00:54:52,832
the better chance we 're going to find Tangles.

817
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,475
Fucking Tangles, man.
I know, mate.

818
00:54:59,485 --> 00:55:04,675
Hey, mate, I'm with you.
I'm with you.

819
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:06,193
Come on.

820
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,235
Come on.

821
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:11,795
Pete made sense,

822
00:55:11,805 --> 00:55:17,355
but I couldn't help but feel like
I was leaving Tangles behind.

823
00:55:17,365 --> 00:55:19,874
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

824
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,397
Is he OK?
Just give him a few minutes.

825
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,475
So, what's the plan?

826
00:55:29,485 --> 00:55:32,756
We get the fuck out of here
is the plan. Get back to the top.

827
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,073
What?

828
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,150
I think we should stay and look for Tangles.

829
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,594
You're not here for Tangles.
You're not here for Tangles.

830
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,390
Fuck!

831
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,993
Just through here.

832
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,037
Fuck!

833
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,595
Back it up, back it up!
Hit the light. Kill the light.

834
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:13,080
Fuck!
Shh!

835
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,280
What is it, mate?
Shh, shh!

836
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,755
Anyone down there?

837
00:56:24,765 --> 00:56:26,318
It's the guard.
Shit, it's the guard.

838
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,195
Who's there?
Hey, mate, it's us. It's the film crew.

839
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:34,036
I told you guys not to come down here.

840
00:56:34,046 --> 00:56:35,755
Yeah, look, I know, we're sorry.

841
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:37,276
It's just our friend, he's gone missing.

842
00:56:37,286 --> 00:56:39,669
Someone... something's taken him.

843
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,995
Right, I want all of you to come with me now.

844
00:56:44,005 --> 00:56:46,875
Hey, come on!
Mate, what's happening in here?

845
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,715
Mate, tell us what's happening in here!
Nat, give it a break, Nat.

846
00:56:49,725 --> 00:56:51,720
We're leaving. LET'S GO!
Is he going to help us?

847
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,430
Go! Go! Run!

848
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,995
Keep moving!

849
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:02,433
Keep going.

850
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,752
Keep going, Nat.

851
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,395
Fuck!
Not that way.

852
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:11,277
Here. Through here.

853
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,275
Kill the light.
Hey?

854
00:57:14,285 --> 00:57:15,793
Steve, kill the light!

855
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,959
Shh!

856
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,032
Where are we?
Shh!

857
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,358
What was that?

858
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,358
I don't know.

859
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,394
Just keep it down,
it could be close.

860
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,196
Did you see it?
No.

861
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,955
But whatever it was,
it was fucking huge.

862
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,832
Nat... turn it off.

863
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,675
Everybody alright?

864
00:58:33,685 --> 00:58:35,155
Mate, mate, I'm alright.

865
00:58:35,165 --> 00:58:38,995
How about your arm?

866
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:41,155
Give me the camera.
Let me see.

867
00:58:41,165 --> 00:58:43,155
I hit something when we were running. It's fine.

868
00:58:43,165 --> 00:58:45,675
Shit, Steve. It looks bad.
Nah.

869
00:58:45,685 --> 00:58:47,475
Here, Pete, I need to see.

870
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:49,715
Here, show me.
Fuck. Doesn't look good, mate.

871
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:52,553
I can't see.
There it is. You got it.

872
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,353
Just there, yeah.

873
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,832
Sorry, you right?

874
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,835
I'll be fine, yeah.
Right, buddy?

875
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:10,400
Thanks, though. Thanks.

876
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,115
You guys ready to move soon?
We can't stay.

877
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:21,875
I just need a minute. Hang on.

878
00:59:21,885 --> 00:59:23,711
What if that thing comes back?

879
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,915
I don't know.

880
00:59:27,925 --> 00:59:34,155
Could we take it?
I doubt it.

881
00:59:34,165 --> 00:59:36,800
Only thing we've got to worry
about now is getting out of here.

882
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,751
Hey, guys, I think it's gone.

883
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,838
Right, let's get moving.

884
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,275
Steve?
Yeah?

885
01:00:01,285 --> 01:00:03,635
You right, mate?
Yeah, mate. Yeah, I'm good.

886
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:05,955
Let's go.
Just keep it quiet.

887
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:07,393
Give me the camera.

888
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,398
Just keep it quiet, OK?

889
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,993
OK, let's go.

890
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,073
Stay close.

891
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,113
Through here.

892
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,915
OK.

893
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,435
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.

894
01:00:37,445 --> 01:00:38,915
OK.

895
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:40,592
Oh, fuck.

896
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,475
Pete...
Shit!

897
01:00:44,485 --> 01:00:47,395
This wasn't here before.
Pete.

898
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:50,035
What are you doing?
It's not on the map.

899
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:51,956
What do you mean it's not on the map?

900
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:53,871
It's only got one way.
This has got two.

901
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,156
Pete, you've got to figure it out, OK?

902
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:59,515
Just chill the fuck out.
It's not easy, alright?

903
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:00,995
You've got to fix this.

904
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:03,235
Just shut the fuck up and let me get through it.

905
01:01:03,245 --> 01:01:06,395
Nat, calm down, Nat.

906
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:08,915
It's through here. We came back
through there. It's through here.

907
01:01:08,925 --> 01:01:11,070
OK, what if it's not the right way, mate?

908
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,555
Well, then... we find the safest room
and we wait it out.

909
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:20,036
Oh, yeah, that's a good plan.

910
01:01:20,046 --> 01:01:21,836
John will figure out that we haven't called

911
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:24,595
and he'll send someone down to find us.

912
01:01:24,605 --> 01:01:26,033
John knows we're here, right?

913
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,875
Nat

914
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:33,996
Fucking tell me John knows we're here.

915
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,319
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.

916
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,315
I can't...
Are you fucking serious?

917
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,955
I... I needed you guys, OK?
I knew it!

918
01:01:45,965 --> 01:01:47,436
I needed you guys in this.

919
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:48,915
You need us?
Yeah.

920
01:01:48,925 --> 01:01:51,115
We just lost a friend.

921
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,475
You still need your fucking story?

922
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,915
No.
Huh?

923
01:01:55,925 --> 01:01:57,395
Fuck you.

924
01:01:57,405 --> 01:01:59,395
Fuck you.
Keep you voice down.

925
01:01:59,405 --> 01:02:00,916
You think you're a fucking journalist.
Shh!

926
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,916
We came down here to get a story, didn't we?

927
01:02:02,926 --> 01:02:04,916
And now we've got an important one,

928
01:02:04,926 --> 01:02:06,796
and you're fucking running scared!

929
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,233
Shhh!

930
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,833
Here's your fucking story.

931
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,475
Here, you want your piece to camera?

932
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:18,913
Come on. Let's go.

933
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,155
What's your piece to camera for this one, huh?

934
01:02:22,165 --> 01:02:24,556
Do you want to tell us how...
how you lost your friend

935
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:26,115
because of your fucking stupidity?

936
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,995
Come on.
Waiting.

937
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:30,315
Fuck you.
Come on, Nat.

938
01:02:30,325 --> 01:02:31,795
Come on.

939
01:02:31,805 --> 01:02:33,676
The best journalists can work under any pressure,

940
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:35,352
any sort of circumstance, come on.

941
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,555
See, you can't say shit, can you?

942
01:02:38,565 --> 01:02:40,035
You know why?

943
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:43,271
Because you're not there, Nat.

944
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,190
You're just not there.

945
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,633
You're fucking pathetic.

946
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,195
Here. Through here.
Yeah.

947
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:01,435
Oh, shit.

948
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,192
Listen.
Shh!

949
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,392
What the fuck...?

950
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,835
What?
Shh.

951
01:03:15,845 --> 01:03:17,795
What is it?

952
01:03:17,805 --> 01:03:19,275
Hear that?

953
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:21,430
Through here.

954
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,953
Kill the light.

955
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,715
Shh!

956
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,151
Open the door, Nat.

957
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,515
Open it up. Open it up.

958
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:43,476
Guys, the lake's just here.

959
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,593
Fuck!
Shh!

960
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,518
Let me see, let me see.

961
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,355
Is it Tangles, mate?
Shh, shh.

962
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:32,875
What is it?
It's not Tangles.

963
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:36,475
What's happened to his face?
Oh, Jesus.

964
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:39,199
It's his eyes. Oh, Jesus.

965
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,275
What's happening?

966
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:44,755
We've got to help him.

967
01:04:44,765 --> 01:04:46,555
Let me see.

968
01:04:46,565 --> 01:04:49,313
Shh.

969
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,798
Shh!

970
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,880
Oh, fuck. It's seen us.

971
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,435
We got to go, come on, come on!
Come on, let's go!

972
01:05:57,445 --> 01:05:59,835
Steve!

973
01:05:59,845 --> 01:06:03,635
Fuck! Let's go. Ah!

974
01:06:03,645 --> 01:06:06,075
Go, go, GO!
Just move it!

975
01:06:06,085 --> 01:06:07,795
Jesus. Which way? Which way?

976
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:09,475
This way?
Go! Go now!

977
01:06:09,485 --> 01:06:11,795
Where? Where?
Here, here, here. Through here!

978
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:13,315
Steve!
Go!

979
01:06:13,325 --> 01:06:16,235
Come on! Keep moving!

980
01:06:16,245 --> 01:06:18,959
Steve! Is he still behind us?

981
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,715
I think we lost him!
You sure?

982
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:24,115
I think so!
Shit.

983
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,872
I think we lost it!

984
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,315
I don't... I don't think it followed us.

985
01:06:30,325 --> 01:06:33,075
In here. There's a light in here.
Here, here.

986
01:06:33,085 --> 01:06:34,875
There.

987
01:06:34,885 --> 01:06:37,553
What's that?
I think it's the Cross City Tunnel.

988
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,475
Hello?
This is a bad place to stop.

989
01:06:42,485 --> 01:06:43,956
No, it's fucking pointless.

990
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,195
Hello?!
Shit, Pete.

991
01:06:47,205 --> 01:06:48,195
Shh!

992
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:51,988
Hello! Hello!
Shh! Shh!

993
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,195
You've got to keep it down.

994
01:06:56,205 --> 01:06:57,876
There's no-one there,
there's no-one there.

995
01:06:57,886 --> 01:07:02,155
Please, someone... help. Hello!
Shh, shh.

996
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:05,355
Hello! Help!

997
01:07:05,365 --> 01:07:08,075
Help!
Shh! Nat, please. Let go. Please.

998
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:09,556
You have to be quiet!
Help!

999
01:07:09,566 --> 01:07:12,275
Shh!

1000
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:14,515
Shh! Nat, Nat, Nat.

1001
01:07:14,525 --> 01:07:17,395
Hey, you guys.
Help!

1002
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:18,636
You've gotta keep your voice down.

1003
01:07:18,646 --> 01:07:21,715
Shhh!

1004
01:07:21,725 --> 01:07:23,400
Shut her up.

1005
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,837
Shh. Shh.

1006
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,955
You get anything?
Can you see anything?

1007
01:07:41,965 --> 01:07:43,791
Chuck the light.
Chuck the light over there.

1008
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,193
Nuh.

1009
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,075
It's alright.
I'm sorry.

1010
01:07:53,085 --> 01:07:55,235
Hey?
I'm sorry.

1011
01:07:55,245 --> 01:07:56,912
It's alright, don't be sorry.

1012
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,195
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Shh.

1013
01:08:06,205 --> 01:08:09,715
It's OK, shh. Shh.

1014
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,355
Everything was unravelling.

1015
01:08:14,365 --> 01:08:16,112
It... it was because of me.

1016
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,315
I never meant for things to get so out of hand.

1017
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,478
Well, I didn't mean to let Pete down. I mean, I

1018
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,355
I had thought I'd made
the right choice at the time

1019
01:08:33,365 --> 01:08:34,918
and I didn't mean to let him down.

1020
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,115
Steve, through here.
Quick, quick. Come on, move it, mate.

1021
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:00,553
Up here.

1022
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,470
Nat. Up.

1023
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,518
Come on. Shh!

1024
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,312
Here, Nat, take this.

1025
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,160
Ohhh!

1026
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,555
Mate, get up! Come on!
Ugh!

1027
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:32,195
You know, my natural instinct
was to turn around with the light,

1028
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:33,675
see what was going on.

1029
01:09:33,685 --> 01:09:36,555
We'd just heard this sound,
Pete yelling out, and, uh,

1030
01:09:36,565 --> 01:09:39,195
as soon as they sort of fell
into the pool of light

1031
01:09:39,205 --> 01:09:42,715
the thing just...disappeared...
upped and left

1032
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:44,995
And that sort of dawned on me then

1033
01:09:45,005 --> 01:09:50,915
that the light was our way
of keeping it away from us.

1034
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:53,435
Shit. Are you OK? You OK?
Come on!

1035
01:09:53,445 --> 01:09:55,431
Fuck! Did you see that?

1036
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,755
It took off.
Let's get out of here. Let's go.

1037
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,075
It didn't like the light.
Well, keep it on, then.

1038
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,991
Hold on. Nat.

1039
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,920
Nat!

1040
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,835
Ah!
No!

1041
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:16,956
Come on, come on!

1042
01:10:16,966 --> 01:10:19,595
Come on, you fucker!
Pete! Pete, don't.

1043
01:10:19,605 --> 01:10:21,715
Come on! Come on!
Go! Come on!

1044
01:10:21,725 --> 01:10:23,795
It was almost like it was

1045
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:28,915
trying to get us in a position
where it could get to us as well.

1046
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:32,754
It reminded me of a lion trying to
cut one animal out of a pack, a herd.

1047
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,557
You know, get the weak one out,
easy to attack.

1048
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,475
Ah! Oh, fuck! Fuck.
We're losing the light!

1049
01:10:45,485 --> 01:10:47,475
Oh, fuck!
- Steve!

1050
01:10:47,485 --> 01:10:51,035
Oh, shit!
Back, back, back!

1051
01:10:51,045 --> 01:10:52,871
BACK! Fuck!

1052
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,280
Go through.

1053
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,355
What's the matter?

1054
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,477
No, it's a dead end. It's a dead end.

1055
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,115
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

1056
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:19,755
I thought that was it...
it was over.

1057
01:11:19,765 --> 01:11:21,512
There was nowhere left to run.

1058
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,672
Then I saw this tiny bit of wall
that looked like it had broken away.

1059
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,795
Pete, take this, take this.

1060
01:11:31,805 --> 01:11:34,395
Take it!

1061
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:36,075
Oh, shit!

1062
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:37,876
Give her a hand, Pete. Get in there.

1063
01:11:37,886 --> 01:11:40,755
Hold the light still.

1064
01:11:40,765 --> 01:11:43,911
Easy, Nat.
Shh, keep it down. Keep it down.

1065
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,875
Keep it down.

1066
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:50,635
Here, come through, Steve.

1067
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:52,115
Huh?
Come through.

1068
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:54,315
Go, go, go.
Go on, you go first.

1069
01:11:54,325 --> 01:11:55,795
Come on, Nat.

1070
01:11:55,805 --> 01:11:57,555
Good girl.

1071
01:11:57,565 --> 01:11:59,676
Here, take this... quick.

1072
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,036
Here, Nat.
OK.

1073
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,877
Shh, shh, keep it down. Shh!

1074
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,915
This isn't good.

1075
01:12:52,925 --> 01:12:55,595
Steve.

1076
01:12:55,605 --> 01:12:58,433
Steve, is that...? God.

1077
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,033
This isn't good.

1078
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,235
Steve.
Yeah?

1079
01:13:05,245 --> 01:13:06,514
We've got to go.

1080
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,915
Fuck!

1081
01:13:09,925 --> 01:13:11,755
Light, mate, light.
Sorry.

1082
01:13:11,765 --> 01:13:13,555
It's gone.
Batteries.

1083
01:13:13,565 --> 01:13:14,555
Steve

1084
01:13:14,565 --> 01:13:18,189
Fuck, I need some light over here.
Quick, Nat, light.

1085
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,436
Nat, the fucking light, Nat. Fuck!
Give me the torch.

1086
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,515
Oh, shit! That one's dead.

1087
01:13:34,525 --> 01:13:36,835
Oh, Jesus.
There's only one left.

1088
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:40,315
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

1089
01:13:40,325 --> 01:13:41,753
Steve, we need that light.

1090
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,435
We need the fucking light.
Steve, I need the fucking light!

1091
01:13:46,445 --> 01:13:47,475
Come on!

1092
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,435
OK.

1093
01:13:51,445 --> 01:13:53,954
Oh, Jesus.

1094
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,072
OK, now

1095
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,958
RUN!

1096
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,475
Steve.

1097
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,595
Steve. OK, OK.

1098
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:31,555
Steve.

1099
01:18:31,565 --> 01:18:35,155
Come on. It's going for her.
It's going for her.

1100
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,155
We've got to go.

1101
01:18:38,165 --> 01:18:39,957
Come on. Come on.

1102
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,349
Nat!
Nat!

1103
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,275
Let her go!
Let her go, you fucker!

1104
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:47,840
Nat!

1105
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,315
Take her. Take her!
OK.

1106
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:54,437
Go. Just go!
Come on, Nat. Alright, let's go.

1107
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,275
Oh, shit. Come on.
- Come on!

1108
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,440
Come on, you fucker!

1109
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,795
Come on, Nat.

1110
01:20:10,805 --> 01:20:12,275
Come on, let's move!

1111
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:14,835
No...
Move!

1112
01:20:14,845 --> 01:20:17,275
No.
Come on.

1113
01:20:17,285 --> 01:20:19,795
Come on.

1114
01:20:19,805 --> 01:20:22,075
Wait!
Come on.

1115
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:23,635
But Pete...
Come on!

1116
01:20:23,645 --> 01:20:26,035
No. Steve, we can't leave.
Come on!

1117
01:20:26,045 --> 01:20:27,675
We got

1118
01:20:27,685 --> 01:20:30,353
Nat, keep moving.
Keep moving!

1119
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,955
No.
We've got to keep moving!

1120
01:20:32,965 --> 01:20:35,595
You can't leave Pete.
We can't! We've got to go!

1121
01:20:35,605 --> 01:20:38,075
Come on, Nat.
We've got to keep moving.

1122
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:41,355
I think that Pete was looking out for us

1123
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:44,033
and I didn't want to leave him there.

1124
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,873
Come on! Come on.

1125
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,755
Pete wanted us to be safe...
I understand that.

1126
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,435
But I didn't...
I didn't want to leave Pete behind.

1127
01:20:55,445 --> 01:20:57,315
Come on.

1128
01:20:57,325 --> 01:20:59,795
Come on. Come on.
- Guys!

1129
01:20:59,805 --> 01:21:02,195
Guys!

1130
01:21:02,205 --> 01:21:05,715
Shit!
Guys!

1131
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,435
Oh, fuck. It's Pete. Fuck.

1132
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,395
Come on, man!

1133
01:21:13,405 --> 01:21:15,595
When I heard Pete's voice

1134
01:21:15,605 --> 01:21:20,235
coming down that tunnel,
out of the darkness, uh

1135
01:21:20,245 --> 01:21:23,516
I mean, I wasn't expecting
to hear his voice again.

1136
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,955
Pete, no...
I can't

1137
01:21:27,965 --> 01:21:29,875
No

1138
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,030
Let's go.

1139
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,000
Let's go!

1140
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,470
No, Pete...
- Nat!

1141
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,355
Pete, are you OK? Stay with me.
Help! Get some help! Someone!

1142
01:22:13,365 --> 01:22:18,639
I need a phone! I need a phone!
Give me a phone! Give me a phone!

1143
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,752
Hey.

1144
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,155
Hello. Police, fire or ambulance?

1145
01:22:26,165 --> 01:22:27,835
Hello?
Yes. Hello?

1146
01:22:27,845 --> 01:22:30,675
Do you need police, fire or ambulance?
Hello!

1147
01:22:30,685 --> 01:22:32,156
Help! We need help, we need help!

1148
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:34,156
OK, miss, we'll get you some help.
What's happened?

1149
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:36,555
We're on platform one.
We're in the station.

1150
01:22:36,565 --> 01:22:40,115
Please, you gotta get someone here now.

1151
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:45,555
My friend is dying. He's bleeding.
Please calm down, miss.

1152
01:22:45,565 --> 01:22:48,995
I need you to tell me exactly
where you are and what's happening.

1153
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:51,155
I don't know... we're in the station

1154
01:22:51,165 --> 01:22:54,435
and something...
something took our friend.

1155
01:22:54,445 --> 01:22:57,755
OK, please stay calm.
You said you're at the station?

1156
01:22:57,765 --> 01:23:01,515
Which station are you at?
Help me! Somebody HELP me!

1157
01:23:01,525 --> 01:23:03,115
What are you doing?!

1158
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,680
Hello? Hello?

1159
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,796
Hello? Are you there?

1160
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,360
Hello?

1161
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,920
Pete... Hey, Pete.

1162
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,280
Pete

1163
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,840
I'm sorry... Pete! PETE!

1164
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:54,035
Yeah, it's kind of hard to...
to talk about it now.

1165
01:23:54,045 --> 01:23:56,035
But I didn't know he was dying at that point.

1166
01:23:56,045 --> 01:23:59,155
You know, I thought we were all gonna be fine.

1167
01:23:59,165 --> 01:24:00,835
I mean

1168
01:24:00,845 --> 01:24:05,235
.. it had been so difficult to get
to that point where we got there,

1169
01:24:05,245 --> 01:24:07,716
and then, you know, I thought
we were going to be OK.

1170
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:09,870
There was people around us,
there was light.

1171
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,475
I...you know... I would have been doing more

1172
01:24:14,485 --> 01:24:16,710
if I thought he was lying there dying.

1173
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:25,789
I...I feel that I could have
done more to help Pete.

1174
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,675
You know, it's, um...it's easy to say

1175
01:24:30,685 --> 01:24:34,275
that you would do things differently,
you know.

1176
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,077
It just didn't seem...very fair.

1177
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,235
I got told by the first paramedics

1178
01:24:45,245 --> 01:24:50,035
that, you know...
they'd sort of given up working on him,

1179
01:24:50,045 --> 01:24:55,319
they sort of...you know...
took a while to get Nat away from him.

1180
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:59,915
And, uh,
it slowly, slowly dawned on me

1181
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:02,195
about that point, you know.

1182
01:25:02,205 --> 01:25:03,755
They sort of walked away from him.

1183
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,596
He was just lying there,
and he wasn't moving,

1184
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:07,670
and I was... I just thought, "Fuck."

1185
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,672
I feel...I feel...I feel responsible.

1186
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,317
I don't want to say that
I felt like it was my fault.

1187
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,795
I don't know exactly how
I've changed since that night.

1188
01:25:49,805 --> 01:25:53,355
I can't help thinking we were so close.

1189
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:54,998
Help was right there.

1190
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,077
I go over it again and again.

1191
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,957
Just constantly.

1192
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,432
What would I do differently?

1193
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,795
I was just pissed off with everyone, everything.

1194
01:26:26,805 --> 01:26:28,233
The government

1195
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,035
.. the police

1196
01:26:32,045 --> 01:26:34,675
I mean, how much evidence do you want?

1197
01:26:34,685 --> 01:26:38,434
It's just sad now, thinking about it.
It's pointless.

1198
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,393
It's just fucking sad.
