82
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:49,787

83
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,129

84
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:54,924

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,027

Do you expect us to live like this?

It's perfectly serviceable -
Derelict is what it is dr. Rhodes -

97
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,024
my husband is brigadier in the army

98
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:07,968
and he wouldn't let his men stand a place like this
let alone a group of school children

99
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:10,907
but the place is soon come back to life

100
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,415

239
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:55,675
You'll be in trouble, you have to tell me

240
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:58,845
Please, Edward

241
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,958
"She told me not to tell"

242
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:11,030
Who?

243
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:12,762
Who told you not to tell?

244
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:16,646

245
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:21,782

246
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:33,020
"You let him go"

00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:37,386
did she tell you to say this to me?

248
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:01,046

249
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:02,584

00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:05,225
We did, didn't we, Edward?

251
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,397

253
00:34:09,578 --> 00:34:10,425
Why?

254
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,922
He's not your boyfriend

256
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,188

You've taken quite a shine

263
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,133
No, i'll be careful

264
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,926
i know what everyone says about pilot

265
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,628
don't think it's like that

266
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:35,182
No, What do i..

267
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,248
reminds me of my husband

268
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:40,134
something about the eyes

269
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,190
was your husband called up?

270
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,544
open services our whole life

271
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:49,967
brit army families, now our boys

272
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:51,214
i didn't know you had children

273
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,510
Well, they're not children

274
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:55,598
that changed the day they volunteered

275
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:58,160
Do you have any photos?

276
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,143
i know what they look like

277
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:03,859
You must miss him -
Would you excuse me -

278
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:14,126
i'm sorry

279
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:19,641
just,  we all have a way of coping
this is mine

280
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,413
Well i'm sure they'll come back to you

281
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:28,062
you know my husband teases me

282
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:31,946
says i'm the toughest soldier he's ever met

283
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:35,774


284
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:40,799
but our own worst enemy is ourselves

285
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:43,492
our fears

286
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:44,772
darks

287
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,118
despair

288
00:36:51,236 --> 00:36:52,485
that's what will destroy us

289
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,980
Good night Eve

290
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:00,015

But i know how good you all out 
coping with accident

312
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:34,521
when you have it back home

313
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:37,827
but you must understand

314
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:41,064
That eventhough we came here to be safe

315
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,583
that out in the countryside

316
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:46,034
here

317
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,956
There's still danger

318
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:54,157
Now i want everyone to stay together today
even at playtime

319
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:56,462
Do you understand me?

320
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:04,111
I'll write to the boys mother

321
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,661


322
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:17,916
Sorry

323
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:20,347
i don't think any of us 
could ever be sorry enough

324
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:23,343
Doctor i think we shouldn't stay here

325
00:42:23,378 --> 00:42:24,711
I've told you, there's nowhere else

326
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:26,456
but it isn't safe

327
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:28,185
Tha's all our job to make it safe

328
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,869
sorry, i didn't mean to

329
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:31,128
what's your point then?

330
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:36,556
ehm... are you sure there's nobody else living here-

331
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:38,136
What do you mean?

332
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:41,444
I think i saw someone

333
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:43,145

334
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:45,746
i tried , i called out

335
00:42:45,781 --> 00:42:47,598
but she dissappeared

336
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:51,683
I think you should keep your visions
to yourself

337
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,683
not visions

338
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:55,452
You're not listening to me -
No, you listen to me -

339
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:59,667
This is not the first body i brought from 
..Ms. Parkins

340
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:02,974
I remember the last war
i've seen what it can do

341
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,364
You need to be better prepared for this one

342
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:23,458
There you are Edward

350
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:47,588
i had the key

351
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,121
A key, there must be others

352
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:53,276
m

353
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:54,629
someone else unlocked it

354
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:55,961
Who?

355
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,742
No, What, what are you going to say?

356
00:46:03,162 --> 00:46:05,705
I think there's somebody else on this island

357
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:07,856
Living here?

358
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,820
Saw them in the sellar and by the graveyard

359
00:46:16,558 --> 00:46:18,476
it's just me , i haven't sleep in row

360
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:20,256

00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:49,628

00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:15,363

374
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:25,356

00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:07,622
So Janet was Nathaniel's mother

379
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,591
But Alice brought him up

380
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:12,508
Until he drowned

381
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:15,498
that's what i had

382
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:17,299
The carriege falling into the marge

383
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:22,574
i must be going mad

384
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,777
No

385
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:27,172
No, i believe you saw someone

386
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,726
and i believe that's something happen here

387
00:50:30,014 --> 00:50:32,152
but we've looked everywhere on the island

388
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:35,537
I know where i've seen this letter before

389
00:50:37,694 --> 00:50:39,372
Village
390
00m:50:42,156 --> 00:50:44,932
I have to report back to base, i'll drop you first
shouldn't be long

390
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:50,162
What's wrong?

391
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:52,476
Tide's coming in, need to hurry

392
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:55,408
It's fine -
No, it's not -

393
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:01,176
Slow down

394
00:51:03,948 --> 00:51:05,455
Harry -
Speak quite -

395
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:07,155
I need to concentrate

396
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:38,162
We were shot down over the sea

397
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:44,880
My crew was trap

398
00:51:47,185 --> 00:51:49,383
i could hear them calling to me

399
00:51:54,346 --> 00:51:55,688


400
00:51:58,243 --> 00:51:59,047
it was so dark

401
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:02,172
Couldn't breathe properly

402
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:05,271
I'm sure it wasn't -
No, It was, they were my crew -

403
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:12,625
I was the only one survive

404
00:52:14,988 --> 00:52:16,501
So now i don't like the water

405
00:52:41,249 --> 00:52:42,343
How did you get this?

406
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:47,017
Tom had it in his pocket the night he died
how did you get it back?

407
00:52:54,048 --> 00:52:55,682
get off

408
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:40,863
Hello

409
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:44,833
Hello

410
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,252
Edward

411
00:53:55,952 --> 00:53:57,147
Edward

412
00:53:57,455 --> 00:53:59,478
Mrs. Hogg said you need to come now

413
00:54:06,778 --> 00:54:07,865
Edward

414
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:12,087
Edward
This isn't funny

415
00:54:42,688 --> 00:54:45,073
Edward
You're in so much trouble

416
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,100
Edward

417
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,957
Edward

418
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:01,170
Edward

419
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,922
Don't be such a

420
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,546
Who's there?

421
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:13,822
let me out

422
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:25,054
Whenever she seen, and who ever by

423
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,442
one thing certain

424
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:30,561
A child shall die

425
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:37,383
Tell me how to stop -
You're too late  -

426
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:40,123
We tried, She killed all my friends..

427
00:56:41,461 --> 00:56:43,777
Come back please, we're leaving

428
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:45,372
we're leaving

429
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,259
Your fault

430
00:57:22,551 --> 00:57:24,177
never needed eyes to hunt

431
00:57:29,473 --> 00:57:32,961
My friends had eyes, that's all i cried

432
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:36,478
My friends have eyes, that's so they died 

433
00:57:41,852 --> 00:57:44,174
Joyce, you're not mean to be in this room

434
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:46,786
Joyce

435
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:55,055
Your fault

436
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:02,723
Harry

437
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,543
Harry, Harry

438
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:11,157
What happen?

439
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,557
Quickly

440
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:44,528
Dear Nathaniel

441
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:48,152
Tried to tell you the truth, but you're too young to understand

442
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:51,773
I tried to take you away

443
00:58:51,808 --> 00:58:55,725
They discovered my plan, now they won't let me near you

444
00:58:55,974 --> 00:59:00,784
They're sending me to asylum
So i'm leaving this letter with my solicitor, Mr. Grome

445
00:59:01,106 --> 00:59:03,957
They can not stop him from giving it to you
when you're older

446
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:08,564
You grown up thingking Alice Drablow was your mother
But she is not

447
00:59:09,472 --> 00:59:13,019
Your father, Charles Drablow got me pregnant

448
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:14,489
This is the truth

449
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:17,657
Please believe it, i will never let you go

450
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:21,342
So please, come to me as soon as you can

451
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:24,551
For i was, am and always shall be your mother

452
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:27,551
Jannet Humphrey

453
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:30,305
He died two days later

454
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:33,908
So he never knew

455
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:38,933
Never knew she was his mother

456
00:59:42,397 --> 00:59:47,077
It's preposterous-
Even if you don't believe me, Why take the chance -

457
00:59:47,112 --> 00:59:50,733
Harry will take us to the station and we'll just leave -
Enough - Jean -

458
00:59:50,768 --> 00:59:53,427
...I'm telling you that we have to -
Get out -

459
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,637
Go on

460
00:59:56,672 --> 00:59:59,659
You want to? i dont want you here a moment longer

461
00:59:59,694 --> 01:00:01,276
I won't leave them here

462
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:04,586
I found Joyce today, trying to strangled her self

463
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:07,228
Don't you see, you poison them

464
01:00:07,263 --> 01:00:09,274
That was Jannet

465
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,547
Don't you see, She's been seen

466
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:13,328
We can't leave, we need to get the children to the sellar

467
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:14,558
Now

468
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:16,881
that's right, come along

469
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:18,099
Quick as you can

470
01:00:20,314 --> 01:00:20,314


471
01:00:22,974 --> 01:00:24,505
Stay away from the glasses

472
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:26,044
Be careful

473
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:31,868
It's okay

474
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:43,630
Nobody deserve to suffer like she did

475
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,033
Why is it got to you?

476
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:51,560
Eve

477
01:00:53,457 --> 01:00:54,900
I had a child

478
01:00:54,935 --> 01:00:56,257
Son

479
01:01:01,475 --> 01:01:02,566
It wasn't married

480
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:06,890
....I was too young so they

481
01:01:07,557 --> 01:01:09,532
they took away fom me

482
01:01:15,265 --> 01:01:17,241


483
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:19,514
let me see him, please

484
01:01:19,549 --> 01:01:21,876
I've tried looking for him but..

485
01:01:24,976 --> 01:01:26,825
They won't tell me where he was

486
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:31,197
or his name

487
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:36,658
after while i just gave up

488
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:42,748
I let him go

489
01:01:47,586 --> 01:01:49,784
We can't let the past 

490
01:01:51,995 --> 01:01:53,361
It's just too much to do

491
01:01:55,603 --> 01:01:57,138
too much to live for, right?

492
01:02:02,092 --> 01:02:05,249
She knows -
it's got nothing to do with her -

493
01:02:05,284 --> 01:02:06,931
she told me

494
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:08,685
You let him go

495
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,312
That was Alice, remember she said she blamed her 
fot Nathaniel's death

496
01:02:13,674 --> 01:02:15,574
Made her watch it over, and over again

497
01:02:16,284 --> 01:02:18,389
This is got nothing to do with you

498
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:19,625
You're wrong

499
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,989
Eve, You need to listen to me

500
01:02:22,165 --> 01:02:23,899
She wants to take something away from me

501
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:25,362
What?

502
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,333
she wants to turn him againt me

503
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:41,622
Everybody stay together

504
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,620
Edward, come here

505
01:02:43,655 --> 01:02:45,072
Come here, stay close

506
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:48,492


507
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,445
Miss, i found some matches

508
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,624

510
01:03:39,552 --> 01:03:41,057
Let's get the other ones led

511
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,874
Where's Joyce?

512
01:03:44,957 --> 01:03:45,728
Joyce

513
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:48,711
Joyce

514
01:04:01,677 --> 01:04:02,307
Joyce

515
01:04:03,697 --> 01:04:04,901
Joyce

516
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:14,417
Joyce

517
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:16,946
Joyce

518
01:04:19,513 --> 01:04:20,930
No, Joyce

519
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:23,576
Joyce -
no, no, no -

520
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:27,626
no, no

521
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:33,359
no

522
01:04:55,547 --> 01:04:56,593
Tide's clear

523
01:04:56,987 --> 01:05:00,467
So i can take you back to 
And i will figure out the way to get you home

524
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:02,542
i'm not going back there

525
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:05,328
Take us to the air field

526
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:12,492
Alright

527
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,886
Ruby, that's yours

528
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:18,096
You should leave that, belongs here

529
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:20,487
Give it to me, give it, Edward

530
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:01,139


531
01:06:03,747 --> 01:06:06,106
Come back here Fraser

532
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:15,436
Not real

533
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,575
Harry

534
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:25,242
Harry!

535
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,021
Harry!!

536
01:06:28,056 --> 01:06:31,990
It's dummy air field, so now they bomb here
Instead of real one

537
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,650
i move lights around, make it look like
Plane's taking off

538
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:38,160
make us fireball, make it look like it hit us

539
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,637
I'm a decoy -
You said you were pilot -

540
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:47,074
i was, but after crash

541
01:06:47,109 --> 01:06:48,659
I can't fly anymore

542
01:06:50,488 --> 01:06:52,407
So they send me here

543
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:57,062
demoted me, Lack of moral fiber they said

544
01:06:57,398 --> 01:07:02,355
LMF, means you're a coward

545
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,913
Officially

546
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,693
Why didn't you tell me?

547
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:08,679
like the way you saw me

548
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:12,897
See??

549
01:07:13,815 --> 01:07:15,919
it's that smile again

550
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:53,452


551
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,691
We'll get the next train out of here

552
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,157
When is that Ms? -
Tomorrow morning -

553
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:02,980

Okay, go sit down

554
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:18,049

556
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,972
Miss..

557
01:08:45,007 --> 01:08:45,631
Yes, Flora

558
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:47,598
Tom said Edward saw a ghost 

559
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,114
Is it true?

560
01:08:53,492 --> 01:08:56,452
Yes -
These are lies children -

561
01:08:56,755 --> 01:08:59,230
...there is no such thing -
alright, that's enough -

562
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,863
She's telling the truth

563
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:06,860
to hide the secret

564
01:09:19,974 --> 01:09:21,417
