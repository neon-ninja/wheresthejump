2
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:06,398
He came back again last night
and tore me like paper.

3
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:11,195
He opened me like a flower of pain...

4
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,990
...and it felt good.

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,495
He sank into me and set me on fire...

6
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,873
...like he always does.

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,211
Made me burn from the inside out.

8
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,173
How did you know it was the devil?

9
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,928
I know what you're thinking.

10
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,057
I know you think
I'm talking about my stepfather...

11
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,684
...because you don't believe
in the devil.

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,313
Okay, let's talk about your stepfather.

13
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:52,069
You know about my stepfather.
You know I cut his throat.

14
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:56,240
I cut his Adam's apple in half...

15
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:00,494
...like a piece of fruit
on a summer day...

16
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,580
...so he wouldn't say a word.

17
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:08,127
I sat next to him
and watched him die...

18
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,505
...slowly.

19
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,053
It was the only way to help him stop.

20
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,305
Stop what?

21
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,560
Stop fucking me!

22
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,439
You're not listening.

23
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,777
I am listening, Chloe.

24
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:39,116
You're not listening with your heart.
Just your brain.

25
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,452
Your brain is the problem.

26
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,625
You have no idea
how it feels not to be trusted.

27
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,045
You've got to trust me too, Chloe.

28
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:58,051
You can't trust someone
who thinks you're crazy.

29
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,851
Okay. I think that's enough for today.

30
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,565
But I do think we made
some really good headway...

31
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,567
...found out some new things--

32
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,362
Do you know what it is
to burn from the inside?

33
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,407
-Do you know? Because you are dead!
-Let her go, Chloe.

34
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:25,120
I am. I'm not touching her!
I'm not touching her! Let me go!

35
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,664
Let me go! Let me go.

36
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,551
Thank you.

37
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,685
You're driving me crazy! Stop!

38
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,395
-Stop it!
-Let go!

39
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,481
Stop it!

40
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,152
I can walk by myself!

41
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,863
Stand up!

42
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,699
Look at that.

43
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,118
"I'm a doctor."

44
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:09,414
"Open this door."
Hey, you are dead!

45
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,333
Get in.

46
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,086
She's nuts.

47
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,105
Hey.

48
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,815
Sorry.

49
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,192
I need to cross-reference some files
with you on Monday.

50
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,236
How's your morning?

51
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,574
-Check with Anna. She'll fit you in.
-Thanks. Sorry.

52
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,540
I'm not discharging her, period.

53
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:38,295
If you want to pursue this, sir,
have a judge order her transfer.

54
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,048
Until then she's mine.

55
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,216
Thank you.

56
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,634
Lawyers.

57
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,221
Hey, come on in.

58
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,640
What's up?

59
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,268
Chloe. She's embellishing
her rape story again.

60
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,314
She says that the devil
is visiting her in her cell.

61
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,484
-Okay.
-It's the third time in three months.

62
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,945
It has something to do with
her stepfather, possibly remorse...

63
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,157
...but instead of assessing
the memory and accepting it...

64
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:13,121
...she just falls into these
satanic meanderings.

65
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,332
Time. Give it time.

66
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,836
I've given it time. Time and Elavil.
And Mellaril and Haldol.

67
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,964
Maybe they're just...

68
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,674
...too medicated.

69
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,012
I know we all create our realities
to some extent. Yes, true.

70
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,600
But what she creates
is so far from any objective reality....

71
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,187
Chloe's mind only runs on one track.

72
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,149
Well, right now,
my mind is running on empty.

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,321
Come here.

74
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:55,247
You have a brilliant mind.

75
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,208
You'll figure it out.

76
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,921
Throw it on the mirror.

77
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,553
This is what she sees now.

78
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,933
-A distorted image of herself.
-Who are you in all this?

79
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,186
-I'm the mirror.
-You are the mirror.

80
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:23,316
If I'm the mirror and she's the image...

81
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,612
...then who are you?

82
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,490
I can see both of you...

83
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,118
...so I'm God.

84
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,913
Or just an overworked
hospital bureaucrat.

85
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,374
"God" is good.

86
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:46,715
Always remember,
the ability to repress...

87
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,970
...is actually a vital survival tool.
Without it...

88
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,432
...Chloe might not have survived.

89
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,736
Sorry, am I interrupting
the happy couple?

90
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:14,618
Dr. Graham. We were just discussing
repression as a survival mechanism.

91
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,412
Oh, yeah, I had a date last week.

92
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,915
I barely survived it.
I'm trying to forget it.

93
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,877
I'm sure your amorous adventures
are fascinating, doctor...

94
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,214
...but sadly, I'm on my way out.

95
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,634
-Well, don't let me-- I'll just--
-No, no, no, I'm leaving.

96
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,137
I'm gonna run out to Willow Creek.
Meet the new contractor.

97
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,599
I'll be here. See you at dinner.

98
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,645
Keep an eye on my wife for me, Pete.
I know you will. Here.

99
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:46,441
-No, thanks.
-No, let me circumcise it for you.

100
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,694
Smoke it tonight while it's fresh.

101
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,659
-Good night, boss.
-Good night, kids.

102
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,124
Why don't we share one of those
golden-crust, cheese-filled specials.

103
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,419
-It sounds like a great offer...
-Here's the file.

104
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,922
-...but I got work to do.
-I'm buying.

105
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,800
-It's cold when it gets here.
-We could warm it up.

106
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,969
-I hate pizza.
-Who doesn't like pizza?

107
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,096
Come on, you gotta eat.

108
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,348
Not with you.

109
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,728
Come on, we're supposed to celebrate.
I just got circumcised....

110
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,237
-Who's inside?
-We have Shelley for observation.

111
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,865
-Why? What happened?
-She had another attack.

112
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,203
-What'd you do, up her meds?
-Yeah, 25 milligrams.

113
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,540
That's extreme.
That dose is way too high.

114
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,334
I want a copy of that on my desk
by Monday, okay?

115
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,212
-Okay.
-Thank you.

116
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,752
Damn generator.

117
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,296
Not again.

118
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,008
Irene, is that you?

119
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,511
This electric system's
gonna give us trouble.

120
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,181
Fourth time this week.
I'm going for my swim.

121
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:45,268
Well, I'm gonna do my job,
as long as these damn lights stay on.

122
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,556
-Good night, Joe.
-Hey, how many laps, doc?

123
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,142
Fifty-five, but who's counting?

124
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,271
Oh, you've outdone yourself.
Hey, safe drive home.

125
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,859
-Thank you. Say hi to your wife for me.
-Will do.

126
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,007
All that education
but you can't remember an umbrella.

127
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,678
-Did you get my note?
-I got your note. Your business note.

128
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,140
Right. So how was your date with...?

129
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:11,062
With what's-her-name? It was like all of
my dates. It was brief. It was pointless.

130
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,607
She didn't respond to my sense
of humour, my boyish good looks...

131
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,651
...so I started talking about work.

132
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,238
She said that was not
a suitable topic for a first date...

133
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,825
...and that was it.
I mean, it was just drinks, you know.

134
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,202
I mean, we didn't even have dinner.

135
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,872
She's not right.
When you know, you know.

136
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,040
I know.

137
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,170
-I'll follow you down the hill.
-You don't have to.

138
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:40,341
-I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
-Since when did you listen to the boss?

139
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,059
Severe showers all over northern
Connecticut and New Hampshire.

140
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,312
-I know, I see that.
--rain in Lennox County....

141
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,073
--flooding throughout
Lennox County and closure....

142
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,416
-I can't let you through. Road's closed.
-What's going on?

143
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,460
-I got this.
-There's a sinkhole.

144
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,338
-Hi, Bob.
-You picked a hell of a night for a drive.

145
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,384
There's a sinkhole up here,
you can't get through. Sorry.

146
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,971
-What should I do?
-Go a quarter of a mile, take a left--

147
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,473
You know that bridge
that Doug and I fish at?

148
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,976
-Yeah, the little white one?
-That's the one.

149
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,811
-Yeah.
-You can go across there.

150
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,564
-Okay, thanks.
-Hey, tell Doug to give me a call.

151
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,732
Will do.

152
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,498
-Doug, you're home?
-Yeah, where are you?

153
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:40,461
I got detoured, so I'll be home in a few
minutes, okay? How was Willow Creek?

154
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,339
This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big mess.

155
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,092
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

156
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,429
Doug.

157
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,432
Doug!

158
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:30,553
Are you okay?

159
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,557
Hey!

160
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,948
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Okay.

161
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,911
I'm a doctor. I'm gonna take you
to the hospital. I'm a doctor, honey.

162
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,706
I'm gonna help you, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

163
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,042
I'm gonna help you, okay?

164
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,617
Help me!

165
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,036
Somebody!

166
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,004
Dr. Graham!

167
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,132
You better tell me
why I'm in here, Irene.

168
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,843
She got up wild.

169
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,972
-Bring your ass back in here.
-Give me 40 milligrams of Ativan.

170
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,725
-Get your hands off me.
-Stay in the cell.

171
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,643
-Keep her off.
-Restrain her.

172
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:05,565
Keep her off of me. Get off of me.
Do you hear me? Get off of me.

173
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,859
Hold on. Calm--

174
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,779
What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?

175
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,242
Thank you, nurse.

176
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,413
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, she calmed down.

177
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,124
This is so sad.

178
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,712
Miranda, this is very awkward.

179
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,132
I suppose that technically
I shouldn't even be treating you...

180
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,926
...but I managed to get the court
to grant us a waiver...

181
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,511
...until you're transferred.

182
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,139
Anything we discuss
is in strict confidence...

183
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,391
...and won't go anywhere but this room.

184
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,188
How long have I been in here?

185
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,192
Three days.

186
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,444
Why? Why?

187
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,907
You were admitted to our neurosurgical
unit, you were seizing violently.

188
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,036
We did scans and they revealed
left-sided weakness, numbness...

189
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,455
...severe frontal-lobe deficits.

190
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,333
You received Haloperidol,
Ativan injections.

191
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,045
When you came out of it, we tested.
You were negative for PCP.

192
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:14,133
You were put in restraints for a day and
a half so you wouldn't injure yourself.

193
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:19,097
And then you basically
went into a state of catatonia.

194
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,558
This is the first time
I've seen you lucid.

195
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,271
I wanna talk to my husband.

196
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,399
Where is he? Where is he?

197
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,861
You know, you're the most
logical person I know, bar none.

198
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,990
You rely only on the facts.

199
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,744
So why am I telling you this?

200
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,040
You're establishing my personality.

201
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,294
You think I'm a rational person. You
don't think I'm impulsive or emotional.

202
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:54,090
And following this pattern of analysis,
we are about to discuss...

203
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,678
...a traumatic event which has rendered
this psychological profile useless.

204
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:03,057
-You think I'm in denial.
-Don't analyse yourself...

205
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,935
...just focus on remembering.

206
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,273
Miranda...

207
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,443
...what's the last thing you remember?

208
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,661
I remember Chloe.

209
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,665
I was having my Friday night
session with Chloe.

210
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,500
How did that go?

211
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,381
She was embellishing her rape story.

212
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,301
-I saw Doug.
-Dr. Graham.

213
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,928
You were there.

214
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,144
When I went back to my office,
I worked on Chloe's file.

215
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,899
I decided to call it quits, I went down
to the pool, had a swim, 55 laps...

216
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:57,820
...saw Joe, got my keys.
Went to my car. You walked me to it.

217
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,741
-Yes.
-But--

218
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,243
-There was a detour.
-Oh, hey, tell Doug....

219
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,789
I had to go over the bridge,
so I went over the bridge.

220
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,801
I wonder what else happened.
Try to remember.

221
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,556
I got home.

222
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,064
I saw Doug. He was on the couch.

223
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,989
Try to remember.

224
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,831
There was a girl.

225
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,377
-Yeah, there was a girl.
-No, there was no--

226
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,046
Yeah, there was a girl.

227
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,465
-A girl at the bridge.
-There was no report--

228
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,884
-There was some kind of accident.
-No.

229
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,638
-The girl was bloody. On the bridge....
-I want to ask you about Doug.

230
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,932
What's the last thing you remember?

231
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,560
Why are you asking about Doug?
I'm telling you about a girl I saw.

232
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,813
Was there any trouble
in your marriage?

233
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,899
No, there was no trouble
in my marriage.

234
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,902
And why are you using
the past tense of the word?

235
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,696
Miranda...

236
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:26,367
...you don't remember anything
about Doug? Anything at all?

237
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,703
Don't tell me something's
wrong with Doug.

238
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,747
I have to tell you something.
Something very difficult.

239
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,582
No, no, no....

240
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:38,337
-Don't tell me something's with Doug.
-Miranda...

241
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,632
...Doug is dead.

242
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,177
You killed him.

243
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,016
-No! No! No!
-Orderly!

244
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,727
I didn't.

245
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,855
-No, I didn't.
-Orderly!

246
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,775
I didn't! I didn't do it! No!

247
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,197
No! No! No, don't do it!

248
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,285
-It's okay.
-I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

249
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,706
I'm on your side.

250
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,174
One little bit more.

251
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,934
Rita. Let go.

252
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,686
It's Dr. Grey.

253
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,820
Look it up. Don't look at me like that.

254
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,621
I'm the official champion again.

255
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,131
Hello, Miranda. Welcome.

256
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,969
You're one of us now.

257
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,223
You know I don't belong here, Chloe.

258
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,560
If you're here,
it must mean that you belong.

259
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,354
You are not a doctor in here.

260
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,774
And even if you tell the truth...

261
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,819
...no one will listen.

262
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,197
You know why? Because you're crazy.

263
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,830
And the more you try
to prove them wrong...

264
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,250
...the crazier you appear.

265
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,587
You are invisible now.

266
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,881
Can you feel it?

267
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,185
Don't touch me.

268
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,562
Are you scared?

269
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,689
No.

270
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,983
You should be.

271
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:14,715
I'm dreaming.

272
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,719
Dream logic, primary process,
that's what this is.

273
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,763
I'm dreaming.

274
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,184
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.
I'm dreaming.

275
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,354
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

276
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:32,274
I'm not crazy. I'm dreaming.

277
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,281
Rise and shine, honey. It's a new day.

278
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,704
I wanna talk to Pete.

279
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:50,334
You'll see Dr. Graham all in good time,
but I want you to have some breakfast.

280
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:57,049
-Why are you doing this to me, Irene?
-I'm just doing my job.

281
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,428
You don't want me to get Jim
to help me, now do you?

282
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,904
Good girl. You're doing good.

283
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,491
Come on, sweetheart,
now it's time for a shower.

284
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:39,133
Come on, honey,
time to wash away your sins.

285
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,067
You're a nut.

286
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,449
Yeah, it's you. You.

287
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,602
Get away. Get away.

288
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,821
What's your problem?

289
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,353
I looked away for a second.
It's unacceptable.

290
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,146
It's not your fault.

291
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:02,776
Patients always find a way to hurt
themselves, if that's what they want.

292
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,029
I never pegged her for a cutter,
that's all.

293
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,031
Neither did I.

294
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,742
Shelley says Chloe's
been threatening Miranda...

295
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,037
...so I put her in isolation for the day.

296
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,664
How is she?

297
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,666
She's a mess.

298
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:22,004
I can't believe she's lost it so quickly.
I've never seen that before.

299
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,465
She cut herself 35 times,
a lot of blood, but it's superficial.

300
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,176
-What was the implement?
-Probably a scalpel...

301
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,221
...though how anybody
got it in there, I have no idea.

302
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,025
Hey, Tony. We're fine.

303
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,459
Come on.

304
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,879
You think I did this
to myself, don't you?

305
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,801
Did you?

306
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,807
No.

307
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,727
Well, I don't know.

308
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,647
Who would it be, then? Would it be...

309
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,483
...Chloe, or...?

310
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,111
I don't know.

311
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,283
By your own admission
you have difficulty...

312
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:38,747
...distinguishing what's reality
from fantasy, so is it possible?

313
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:43,085
Yeah, as a doctor,
I understand why you think that.

314
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:47,464
But something
is really happening to me.

315
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:54,054
What about this moment, right now?

316
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,891
What about it?

317
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,268
Is this a hallucination?

318
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,563
Is it?

319
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:13,281
I suggest that we simply
increase the medication...

320
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,117
...until things make sense.

321
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,453
Or maybe until I can get myself
a new doctor.

322
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,455
Pardon?

323
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:24,292
Since I'm hallucinating
and I can't seem to remember things...

324
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,420
...you can help me with something.

325
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,672
Yeah. Inhale.

326
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,675
Did we have an affair?

327
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,144
No.

328
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,355
Did you want to?

329
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,443
Yes.

330
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,071
Did you think I wanted to?

331
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,158
Yes.

332
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,661
Then why didn't we?

333
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,500
Because you were married to the boss.

334
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,383
But I'm not now.

335
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,180
I'm here-- I'm....

336
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,600
I'm trying to help you.

337
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,853
Why don't you trust me?

338
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:30,859
Because you can't trust somebody
when they think you're crazy.

339
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,387
Phil.

340
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,723
Hello, Miranda.

341
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,476
I need to talk to you for a minute.

342
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,312
This is about Pete.

343
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,319
What about him, Miranda?

344
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,614
I don't think he's the best doctor
to be treating me.

345
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,284
Is your complaint about him
on a personal level?

346
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,915
Pete's the best doctor
I have on my staff now.

347
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,543
And he has my full support.

348
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,212
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miranda.

349
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,658
-Miranda.
-Hi, Teddy.

350
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,000
-How are they treating you?
-Like I'm crazy, Teddy.

351
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,545
-They think I did it, but I didn't do it.
-All right. Thank you.

352
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,215
-I didn't do it, Teddy.
-Have a seat.

353
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,303
Let's not....

354
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,723
Let's not talk about what you did
or didn't do, all right?

355
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,643
What's important is what
I can do for you now.

356
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:34,649
Now, the DA is pushing for a hearing
as early as next week.

357
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:39,487
Next week? We haven't even
had time to investigate.

358
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,448
We can't have a hearing next week.

359
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:46,828
As your attorney, I gotta tell you
the evidence is overwhelming.

360
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,665
You've been placed at the scene.
The sheriff saw you driving home.

361
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,667
The neighbours heard the screams.

362
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,670
They've got the murder weapon
with your prints on it.

363
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,340
Your prints are on the floor,
walls, everything.

364
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,509
Yeah, but what's my motive?
I don't have a motive, Teddy.

365
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:06,014
Why would I do that?
Maybe one of his ex-patients came.

366
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,850
Has anybody checked the files?
Has anybody escaped?

367
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,520
That person would have a motive.
I was there, and I would scream.

368
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,815
-Maybe I went into shock.
-Miranda.

369
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,985
The only shot we have
is to plead temporary insanity.

370
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,865
I don't even know if that's gonna work.
You're a brilliant psychiatrist.

371
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:27,369
That will make jurors think
"If she wanted to kill somebody...

372
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:31,039
...she could probably fake insanity
and get away with it."

373
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,540
I'm not crazy.

374
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,043
-That's the point.
-No, the point is...

375
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:40,048
...I'm the only one around here
that believes I didn't kill my husband!

376
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,348
Do you think I'm crazy?

377
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,145
That's all right. Forget it.

378
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,564
Forget it.

379
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,242
Sheriff Ryan is here.

380
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,452
He'd like to talk to you.

381
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,582
You know he was Doug's best friend,
so I'd advise against it.

382
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,213
It's fine, Teddy.
I don't have anything to hide.

383
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,276
Five minutes.

384
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,532
Hi, Bob.

385
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,535
Miranda.

386
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:57,125
I just have a few questions
that we need to clear up.

387
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:02,005
When you first came in
and he was sitting on the couch...

388
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,257
...the way we reconstruct the crime...

389
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,886
...is the first blow came
from in front of him.

390
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,598
Which means he must have
seen it coming.

391
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,643
And what we don't understand is
how he....

392
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,897
-Why did you do it?
-Sheriff.

393
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,691
How could you kill Doug like that?
He loved you.

394
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:26,863
-That's the question I need answered.
-You don't have to answer.

395
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,908
I don't have any answers
to the questions, Bob.

396
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,118
You don't?
You better start thinking...

397
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,746
...of some answers,
because you're in some trouble.

398
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,624
-Sheriff, that's enough. That's enough!
-No, no, no.

399
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,210
I need her to tell me why she did it.

400
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,587
Okay, we're done. Enough!

401
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,923
Let's kill your friend, see how you feel!

402
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,593
-You said no shock treatment.
-Here's some shock treatment!

403
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,846
-Stop it. Why would you take these out?
-Don't look.

404
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,306
Don't look at them.

405
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,769
I had to pick him up
off the floor, Miranda. In pieces!

406
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,904
Miranda, what's that?

407
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,725
It's okay. It's okay, Miranda.

408
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,604
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Miranda, let's just go. We're done.

409
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:47,193
-Why are you doing this to me?
-It's okay.

410
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:52,657
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me?!

411
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,494
Come in, Miranda.

412
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,957
Please, take a seat.

413
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,840
So....

414
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,384
You wanted to see me.

415
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,306
I was there.

416
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,936
I was there when Doug was killed.

417
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:33,067
But I wasn't alone.

418
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,654
I wasn't there alone,
and that's what "not alone" means.

419
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,824
-Who was there with you?
-I don't know who it was.

420
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,869
I don't know. I don't know who it was.

421
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,912
But somebody else was there.

422
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,084
Miranda.

423
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,504
We know you have no family left.

424
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,132
We are your family now.

425
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,011
I know. I know you....
I know.

426
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,600
I want you to know that we're gonna
do everything we possibly can...

427
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,562
...to help you
and to make you feel secure.

428
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,567
And to make you feel
that you can trust us here.

429
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,572
But there's a hearing scheduled.

430
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,867
-Miranda. Sit down.
-Just-- Come on, sit down.

431
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,620
Miranda.

432
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,094
Who is this girl?

433
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,055
-Put the picture back.
-Who is this girl?

434
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,974
That's my daughter, Rachel.

435
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:53,356
No, this is the girl I saw at the bridge.
This is the girl.

436
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,566
-No.
-How is she? Where is she?

437
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,820
-It's impossible.
-This is the girl I've been seeing.

438
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,947
This girl, right here.

439
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,700
She's dead.

440
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,455
Rachel died four years ago.

441
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,234
I'm a rational person.

442
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,362
I believe in science.

443
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,575
I don't believe in the paranormal.

444
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:32,830
And I don't believe in ghosts.

445
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:41,255
But if you are the ghost
of Rachel Parsons...

446
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,718
...then you would let me out of this cell.

447
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,458
Bob, you leave this?

448
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,352
Shit. Pete's office.

449
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,700
Chloe.

450
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,508
Chloe!

451
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,146
Help me!

452
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,611
Let me go! Let me go!

453
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,240
Check Chloe! Check Chloe!
She needs help!

454
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,931
-Did you talk to Chloe?
-Yes.

455
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,311
-Was she raped?
-Was she raped? No.

456
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,314
-Why?
-Did you check her?

457
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,776
Did I--? She was checked.
Of course she was checked.

458
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,361
-He didn't have time.
-He?

459
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:19,658
-What about her face? She had a cut.
-Ran into a wall. She did that to herself.

460
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:25,122
I saw a tattoo.
Did she talk about a tattoo?

461
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,459
-Why don't you sit down. A tattoo?
-Yeah, a tattoo.

462
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:33,923
A woman in flames, hands up like this:

463
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,092
Like a Biblical image.

464
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,552
The Anima Sola?

465
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:44,892
-The Anima Sola. That's what I saw.
-It's a common archetypal image.

466
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,812
I mean, it's the woman in chains,
awaiting her fate.

467
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:53,067
I'm talking about something I saw
on the chest of a man.

468
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,403
-That's what I saw.
-You're in crisis.

469
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,323
This image is tailor-made
for your state of mind.

470
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,910
A woman in purgatory.

471
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,748
I need you to explain this
to me, though.

472
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:16,423
-Rachel did not commit suicide.
-She jumped off a bridge.

473
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,760
-When I saw her--
-She was washed downstream 5 miles.

474
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,471
-She was cut up.
-You saw her?

475
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,017
-I saw her. Someone did that to her!
-Police, newspapers, coroner wrong?

476
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,436
-Let's reopen the case.
-Maybe they should!

477
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:33,149
-I saw her. And she's connected to me.
-Delusions, hallucinations...

478
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,360
-How, I don't know.
-...disorganized speech, incoherence--

479
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:41,615
Don't rattle off your psychiatric shit!
I know it like the back of my hand!

480
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,450
Good.

481
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,786
Saves me the trouble.

482
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,331
Glass cells
are having electrical problems.

483
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,001
I'm gonna transfer you
to a Psych Ward cell.

484
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,337
One strike, you're going to solitary.

485
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,756
Don't screw up.

486
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,595
Rachel Parsons was there.

487
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,848
Dead or alive, I don't know.

488
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,728
That girl came to me.

489
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,690
She came to me.

490
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,191
Hi, Chloe.

491
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:12,039
I'm sorry.

492
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,334
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

493
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:20,047
I need you to tell me
who did this to you.

494
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,592
Tell me his name, Chloe.

495
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,263
Chloe, tell me.
Tell me anything. Tell me.

496
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,599
I'll tell you one thing:

497
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,435
He can have my body...

498
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,814
...but he will never have my soul.

499
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,315
Never.

500
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,903
The devil.

501
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:14,643
It's okay.

502
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,772
He said you're next.

503
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:37,166
-Try to stay awake.
-Yes, ma'am.

504
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,295
If you need me,
I'll be in the coffee room.

505
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,560
Lights out.

506
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,734
Leave me alone!

507
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,870
-Doesn't even look like a real ant.
-It's got disco balls for eyes.

508
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,956
-'50s B movies, man.
-Giant bug movies are great.

509
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,000
Hey, what is that?

510
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,593
It's Dr. Grey.
She's trying to kill herself.

511
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:57,306
Level C, we've got suicidal behaviour
in cell 33. Sending backup.

512
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,022
Open it!

513
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,652
Dr. Grey's in trouble!

514
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,409
Number 33, open it now!

515
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,458
Oh, damn.
Damn, what a mess.

516
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,253
-Hold her, I'll medicate her.
-What the hell for? She's already out.

517
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,797
Don't argue with me.

518
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,426
Jesus! Easy, easy.
No, don't hurt me.

519
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,930
Stop her! She's got my keys, stop her!

520
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,723
Shit!

521
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,317
Hey! Hey!

522
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,735
Wait! Hey!

523
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,780
We got a runner! Inmate escaping!
Block Three!

524
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,665
-Stay with me.
-All right.

525
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,044
She's gone this way. Let's go!

526
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,965
Clear!

527
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,565
Split up! Keep moving!

528
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,031
She's going up the North Tower!

529
00:59:52,338 --> 01:00:16,153
Shit!

530
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,450
Hey! It's already open!

531
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,375
She's on the upper level!

532
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,795
Hold it right there!

533
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,840
-Dr. Grey!
-We're on Three, she's heading for One!

534
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,177
Go! Go!

535
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,432
Go the other way!

536
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,278
Circle back.

537
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,516
Come on, Hank.

538
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,523
Don't think she made it
to this building anyway.

539
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,738
Yeah, but even so,
there's no way she can get out.

540
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,283
Hide-and-seek. The longer it lasts,
the more overtime we make.

541
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:21,862
-You should be a professor.
-Professors nail the pretty students.

542
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,456
Let's go. I don't think she's in here.

543
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,888
I got it.

544
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,224
Is it clear there?

545
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,397
We checked corridors Four and Five.

546
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:01,735
-We're headed to Six and Seven.
-Yeah. It's Joe, up at the desk.

547
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,905
-What's going on down there?
-Looks dark down there.

548
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,157
What do you mean, what do I mean?

549
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,453
Look, this is the fourth time this month
this has happened. Never mind.

550
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,165
-Ye-- Thank you.
-Finally.

551
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,209
-Took long enough.
-Shit.

552
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,753
Hey, Joe.

553
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,757
You see something?

554
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,927
Yeah, just now
when the monitors came on.

555
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:30,806
Corridor Six, something flashed
in front of the camera.

556
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,184
Frank, East Wing. Don, take the West.
I'll take the stairs.

557
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,774
Here, take my car.

558
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,526
Go. Go.

559
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,070
Go on.

560
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:18,496
What do you want from me?!

561
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:18,807
Okay. Now what?

562
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,028
Miranda, no!

563
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,994
Doug?

564
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,684
No. No, Miranda, no.

565
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:32,398
Miranda, don't! No, don't, please!

566
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:35,360
Please! No! Miranda, no!
No, please!

567
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:39,447
Please! Don't do this to me! No!

568
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,117
Don't! No! Miranda, no, wait!

569
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,285
Don't do this to me, please, Miranda!

570
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,122
Miranda, no! Don't! No!

571
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:51,167
Don't do this to me, Miranda!
Miranda, please!

572
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,044
I love you.

573
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,838
What did I do?

574
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:52,830
Why?

575
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,504
Why me?

576
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:05,093
Why? Why?

577
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,025
Willow Creek.

578
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,443
How was Willow Creek?

579
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:26,364
This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big damn mess.

580
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:55,610
I'll see you in a couple of days.

581
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,456
It's good to be God.

582
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:10,708
I love you.

583
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:37,943
-Drop the knife!
-Drop the gun!

584
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:39,487
Put it on the ground now!

585
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,280
-Drop the gun!
-Drop the knife!

586
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:43,949
-You drop it!
-Holy Christ.

587
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:45,618
What?

588
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,124
Help me, please!

589
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,085
Help!

590
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,504
Carter, get down here now!

591
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,547
Help me, please!

592
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:00,633
Please!

593
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:05,638
All I can tell you is that the girl
has been identified as Tracy Seavers.

594
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,099
She was reported missing
two weeks ago.

595
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:11,519
She was found this morning
by two patrolmen in Willow Creek...

596
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,398
...at a farm belonging to Dr. Douglas
Grey. She is now hospitalised.

597
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,692
Can she speak?
Has she told you anything?

598
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,277
-We can't comment on that.
-Are there others?

599
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,196
We can't confirm that. Excuse me.

600
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,157
Sheriff, is the FBI taking over
this investigation?

601
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:27,159
Why don't you ask the goddamn FBI?

602
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,537
We need her at the hospital
for medication.

603
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,957
Consider house arrest pending trial,
given the circumstances.

604
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,751
Last night,
your client dropped a guard...

605
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:39,255
...assaulted a nurse, escaped from
an institution, stole a car--

606
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,507
And saved a girl's life.

607
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:44,427
-How did she know she was there?
-I don't know.

608
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:48,431
-But the point is--
-The woman is still a murder suspect!

609
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,349
Come here.

610
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,940
The FBI says there could be
more victims.

611
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,776
There were needles down there,
a video camera.

612
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:03,946
Once the press gets ahold of it,
it'll get big and ugly.

613
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:07,199
Now, I need some answers,
and I'm running out of time.

614
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:10,703
So your client isn't going anywhere
until my team....

615
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,504
I need to talk to her.

616
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,603
It's hard to believe
Doug did something like this.

617
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:40,483
We worked together a long time.
I thought I knew him pretty well.

618
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,822
How could I be so blind?

619
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:52,661
Well, you weren't the only one, Phil.

620
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:00,544
Do you think my daughter could
also have been a victim of Doug's?

621
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,880
Yes.

622
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,883
That's what "not alone" means.

623
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:11,013
Rachel was trying to tell me that
she was not Doug's only victim.

624
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:14,475
And all this time...

625
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:19,939
...we thought our baby
had committed suicide.

626
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,817
You see...

627
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,444
...even after she was gone....

628
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,698
Well....

629
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,452
What?

630
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,955
I had this recurring dream about her.

631
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:39,625
Eventually I took medication
to block it out.

632
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,252
What kind of dream?

633
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:45,965
She was burning in flames,
in terrible pain.

634
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,467
I couldn't save her.

635
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:53,514
I saw her exactly the same way,
burning in flames.

636
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,683
What does that mean?

637
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,812
Miranda, I-- I....

638
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,148
I wouldn't look for
a real-world explanation.

639
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:07,069
It's a dream, a delusion.

640
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:10,823
A delusion that we both seem to share.

641
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,585
-Yeah.
-Pete.

642
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,378
I was just talking to Parsons.

643
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,797
I've been wrong about
everything until now.

644
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,925
It's finally clear to me.
The image is finally clear.

645
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:33,220
The man raping women in prison
is connected to the murders.

646
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,389
It goes back to the Anima Sola tattoo.

647
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,809
Miranda, you have to stop doing this.
Do you understand me?

648
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:43,647
Every time people start taking you
seriously, you talk about delusions.

649
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:46,400
I'm not deluded, Pete, I'm possessed.

650
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:49,862
I don't believe in ghosts.

651
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:53,532
Neither do I, but they believe in me.

652
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,993
Great, just great.

653
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,883
Let's go. Come on.

654
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,058
I need to talk to Sheriff Ryan.

655
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:22,186
He's working with the FBI team.
He won't be back tonight.

656
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,396
It's really important.

657
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,523
I'll leave him a message.

658
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,110
Thank you.

659
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,755
Screw it.

660
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,960
I got a message
you wanted to talk to me?

661
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,213
Yeah, Bob.

662
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:35,300
I wanna talk to you. Maybe this time
you can actually hear me.

663
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:40,014
The last time, all you wanted to do was
scream and yell and accuse me--

664
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:44,518
-Is this what you wanna talk about?
-No. I wanna talk about the facts.

665
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,812
They're a little different now, right?

666
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,941
Do you know what happens
to a small-town sheriff...

667
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,110
...when the FBI takes over?

668
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:56,488
-If you know anything, anything--
-Not alone.

669
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,240
What?

670
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,034
Not alone.

671
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:02,453
I know what it means.

672
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,289
There are two killers.

673
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:09,543
Parsons and I both saw a girl
burning in flames.

674
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:14,256
Then I saw Chloe being raped by a man
with an Anima Sola tattoo on his body.

675
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:18,343
A woman burning in flames. Get it?

676
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:23,015
Okay, it's crazy. I know it sounds
crazy. Pete has told me it's crazy.

677
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,809
-You told Pete? When?
-Yes.

678
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:27,519
Yes.

679
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,189
This afternoon. Why?

680
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:36,820
I don't think you're crazy at all.
I don't know why he would dismiss it.

681
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:41,784
-You actually saw this tattoo?
-Yes, I saw it. On a man.

682
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:44,411
I've heard of serial killers
who hunt together.

683
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,622
Classic mentor and disciple syndrome.

684
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:50,042
So we're looking for the disciple?
Who could it be?

685
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:52,419
-I don't know.
-You're a psychiatrist.

686
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,880
What kind of guy
would this have to be?

687
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,341
Okay.

688
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:03,806
He would have to be someone
who grew up in a household...

689
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:06,183
...that had an absent father.

690
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:08,435
He developed...

691
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,897
...an obsessive, over-dependent
relationship with his mother...

692
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:16,068
...which then turned into some
inappropriate sexual attraction.

693
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:20,781
He probably even got off
torturing little animals as a kid.

694
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:27,246
And as a man he is totally confused
about his sexuality.

695
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:29,414
That's who he is.

696
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,169
Man, that's screwed up.

697
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:38,674
But a guy like that could seem
smart and normal, right?

698
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:40,676
Yeah, they usually do. Yeah.

699
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:43,428
Look, Miranda,
I don't wanna scare you...

700
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:46,473
...but if there is a second killer
out there...

701
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,434
...he is frantically trying
to cover his trail.

702
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:53,063
You're a big threat to this guy.
Who knows how much more you know?

703
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,690
I don't know anything else.

704
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:57,484
You saw the tattoo,
found the girl at the barn.

705
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,736
Yeah, but I found all that by instinct.

706
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:02,447
This guy is facing the electric chair.

707
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:06,118
He doesn't have the luxury
of believing in instinct or ghosts.

708
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:10,122
He's gotta believe that Doug
confessed to you what he was doing.

709
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,749
But he didn't confess.

710
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:15,794
Maybe he didn't spill it out loud, but....

711
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:19,923
Well, you know, you're a psychiatrist.

712
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,843
There's a lot of ways to confess.

713
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:27,764
I'm just trying to put myself
in this guy's place.

714
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,979
Then why didn't he go back
to Willow Creek?

715
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,066
-Take care of the girl, clean up?
-Yeah.

716
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:41,820
Well, that's how you get caught.
You panic.

717
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:45,449
Better to let the dust settle.

718
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,202
But about you...

719
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,913
-...he's desperate.
-Yeah?

720
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:53,498
Desperate enough to...

721
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,375
...talk to me?

722
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,381
Well, you're right.

723
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,842
I do fit the profile.

724
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:07,888
Long-time friend of Doug's,
access to the prison.

725
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:12,476
I never did get a kick out of
torturing animals, though.

726
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:17,606
Stop it!

727
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,734
-No!
-Yes!

728
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,073
-You can't kill me!
-I'm not gonna kill you.

729
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:30,535
After this kicks in, I'm gonna have a lot
more fun with you than Doug ever did.

730
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:32,204
Help!

731
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,425
Miranda!

732
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,722
Damn it!

733
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,393
Help me! Help!

734
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,939
Help me!

735
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:25,882
Okay.

736
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:30,762
You tried to escape, Miranda.

737
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:36,560
That means I can do
whatever I want to you.

738
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:43,150
Rachel wasn't the first, you know.

739
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:48,405
Doug killed a girl when he was
15 years old!

740
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:52,451
I helped him bury the body.

741
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,249
What are best friends for?

742
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,796
We got older. But I gotta tell you...

743
01:29:04,964 --> 01:29:08,216
...you never lose your taste
for the young girls.

744
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:11,845
Then we stopped for a long time.

745
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:15,640
But then Dougie
saw sweet Rachel and....

746
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,896
That was an itch way too deep
not to scratch.

747
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:26,860
And then we had the time of our lives
out at Willow Creek.

748
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:29,738
Everything was perfect.

749
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:32,616
Those girls would do anything.

750
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:34,701
We were their god.

751
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:37,287
Until you--

752
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:40,582
Miranda!

753
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,883
You and I both know
you're not getting out of here.

754
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,344
So let's be logical...

755
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,180
...and end this thing.

756
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,359
Thank you, Miranda.

757
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,370
Rachel?

758
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:25,293
This isn't logical.

759
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:27,379
You're already dead!

760
01:30:53,739 --> 01:30:56,241
Logic is overrated.

761
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:39,451
I'm sorry, Miranda.

762
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:56,343
So it's been almost a year
and I still have bad dreams.

763
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:59,387
Sometimes I wake up screaming.

764
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,181
That's normal.

765
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,975
No, not these dreams.

766
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,646
Everyone thought
you and I were crazy...

767
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,898
...but we were seeing the truth.

768
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:12,067
More than they could see.

769
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:16,279
Once you open the door,
you can never close it.

770
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:19,157
Not true. I closed it.

771
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,159
Then I locked it...

772
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:23,119
...and then I threw away the key.

773
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:25,705
I really hope that's true.

774
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:29,459
You know, my train leaves
in half an hour.

775
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,587
Okay. I'll get you on your way.

776
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:39,636
So good luck with your job, okay?

777
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:44,766
I wanted to thank you for what you did.

778
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:47,978
You really helped me.

779
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:50,146
You helped me.

780
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:52,649
You taught me how to listen.

781
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:54,609
Thank you.

782
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:58,196
We made it.

783
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:50,957
No!
