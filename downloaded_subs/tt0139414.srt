3
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,365
to tag beaver?

4
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,366
Imagine.

5
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,368
Imagine.

6
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:56,369
Was that, like, sarcastic?

7
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:59,374
'Cause I know what you
Fish and Game guys think

8
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:01,376
of county sheriffs.

9
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,378
We know you like to
give these one-word,

10
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:05,381
sarcastic answers.

11
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,385
Gee.

12
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:09,386
You ask me,

13
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,388
what an animal does in the wild

14
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,391
is his own business.

15
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:16,395
So long as he
doesn't do it to man.

16
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,398
I think Mark Twain said that.

17
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,401
Yeah, I think he didn't.

18
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:24,405
But since you said it,
I guess we're covered.

19
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:45,432
Everyone's a comedian, sarcastic.

20
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,536
I'm sleepin'.

21
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:09,539
And right in the middle
of a good dream.

22
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,541
And all at once I wake up.

23
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,546
From something that keeps
knocking at my brain.

24
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,548
Before I go in sane.

25
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:21,553
I hold my pillow to my head...

26
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:57,598
Aah! Aah!

27
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,604
So what am I so afraid of.

28
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:02,606
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of...

29
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:04,608
Help!

30
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:09,615
I think I love you.

31
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:12,618
Isn't that what life is made of.

32
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,620
Though it worries...

33
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,622
Aah ha!

34
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,624
Ohh! Ohh!

35
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:21,629
No! Aah!

36
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:42,656
Aah!

37
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:43,657
Aah!

38
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,665
Ohh! Don't let go!

39
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:53,670
Oh ho ho!

40
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:59,679
Aah!

41
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:10,693
Aw, Jesus Christ.

42
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,716
Kelly?

43
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,718
Hey, Kevin.

44
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:31,720
Hi.

45
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,723
Listen, uh, could I
Steal you for a minute?

46
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:46,738
What are you doing?

47
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,742
Heavy breathing, meditating.

48
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:49,743
Meditating?

49
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:51,745
Yes. To relieve stress.

50
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:52,746
Remember, Myra, you're the one

51
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:54,749
who taught me all about breathing.

52
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,751
Yes, but you're doing Lamaze.
Are you giving birth?

53
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:59,755
If you're upset,
long, deep breaths.

54
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,761
Kevin dumped me.

55
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,766
I know.

56
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:09,768
He told you?

57
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:13,772
Well, I sort of had, uh,
inside information.

58
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,781
You?

59
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,783
It started before you, Kelly.

60
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:22,784
I never would have--

61
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:23,785
You?

62
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:26,789
It was just a quick thing
That we thought was over,

63
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,792
and...it's not over.

64
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,794
You and Kevin.

65
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:34,799
I--I wish I could
say something to...

66
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,804
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

67
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:50,820
Sheriff Keough?

68
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,821
Yeah.

69
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:54,824
Fish and Game.
Jack Wells.

70
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:56,827
Any recent bear attacks?

71
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,829
This was no bear.

72
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,831
Bears don't attack
people underwater.

73
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,835
Probably a beaver, then.

74
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,839
Ah, a whole sentence sarcastic.

75
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:18,856
That the way
he came out of the water?

76
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:22,860
Yeah.

77
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,875
Hey.

78
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,877
Hey, Kevin, what's going on?
What's happening?

79
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,881
How's it goin'?
How's your family? Good?

80
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,884
It's great.
So nice to see you.

81
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:41,885
Fuck off.

82
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:42,886
This is business.

83
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:45,889
There was an accident in Maine.

84
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,892
Some guy got killed
by something in a lake.

85
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:51,897
Probably a bear,
But they found a tooth.

86
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:52,898
A tooth?

87
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:53,899
A fragment of a tooth,

88
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,903
one they say couldn't
have come from any bear.

89
00:09:56,903 --> 00:10:00,908
Evidently it looks prehistoric,
like maybe a dinosaur.

90
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:02,910
Oh, well, then I'm sure
that that's what it was.

91
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,913
He was killed by a dinosaur.

92
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,916
Is there anything else?

93
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,918
I, uh, want you to go there.

94
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:09,920
What?

95
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,924
It's probably nothing,
But you're a palaeontologist.

96
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:14,926
This is what we do.

97
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:15,927
What do you mean,
this is what we do?

98
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,930
I'd like you to
check out this tooth.

99
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,933
I'm not a field person.

100
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,936
Well, on this one,
I would like you to be.

101
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:26,941
You want me to go to Maine
to look at a tooth?

102
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,946
Oh, this was Myra's
idea, wasn't it?

103
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,949
- Uh--
-Oh, of course.

104
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:33,951
Get me out of the office
for a few days,

105
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:34,952
wait till I cool off...

106
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:36,954
It has nothing to do with that.

107
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,957
I don't do field work,
and even if I did, Maine?

108
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,959
I'm allergic to timber.

109
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,962
- Kelly.
- I am not going to Maine.

110
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,964
I'm not going to Maine.

111
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:48,969
It's ridiculous.

112
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,975
It's gonna be rough

113
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:55,977
as we go over these mountains.

114
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,981
Yeah, that's fine.
Thank you.

115
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,986
We're doing the best we can.

116
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:04,990
Could you not talk to me?

117
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,995
Thank you.

118
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:17,004
Just came up screaming.

119
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,006
What did he say?

120
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:21,010
Just kind of gurgled.
He was pretty much dead.

121
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,012
You didn't see anything?

122
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:25,014
The lake was calm
until up he came.

123
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:26,015
The tooth is in here.

124
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,020
Oh, that's--
that's the morgue.

125
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,022
Yes.

126
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,025
Well, is the dead guy in there?

127
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,030
That's where they keep them.

128
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,032
Look...

129
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,034
you want me to bring
the tooth out here?

130
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,035
No.

131
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,038
No. Let's...

132
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,039
After you.

133
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,045
This is reptilian.
And this is not a fossil.

134
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:51,048
You really pulled this
out of this guy?

135
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:53,050
Yes, I did.

136
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,054
I'll need to get
a microscopic look at it.

137
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:57,055
There you go.

138
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,061
Great.

139
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:02,062
Maybe I should see--

140
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:05,065
I wouldn't.

141
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:09,071
I can deal with
dead men--bodies.

142
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,077
Ohh.

143
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:18,082
Uhh. Ohh, jeez.

144
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,091
How long did this attack
go on for?

145
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:28,095
Seconds.
8 maybe 10.

146
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:31,099
Oh, and, uh, this is how
he came up to the boat?

147
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,100
Yes.

148
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,103
Uh-huh.

149
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:39,109
I'd like to see this lake.

150
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,112
Nobody lives
with in 25 miles of it,

151
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:45,116
except some old couple
who live right on the lake.

152
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:47,118
Teenagers trek in
every once in a while

153
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:49,122
to skinny-dip.

154
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,125
None have disappeared.

155
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,127
None have spotted
anything unusual.

156
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:55,129
Did you talk to the old couple?

157
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,130
Not yet.

158
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,133
What kind of backup do we have?

159
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,135
We?

160
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:01,137
What?

161
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:04,140
I'm a little unclear
as to why the museum

162
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,141
would send somebody here.

163
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:06,142
You gota thing against museums?

164
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:08,146
No, I got nothing against museums.

165
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:12,150
Ever been in one?

166
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,158
What is that?

167
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:19,160
Lightweight forward-area
air-device unit.

168
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,162
Whatever's out there,

169
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:23,165
one shot with this, it's dead.

170
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,167
Why exactly would you have that?

171
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,175
God.

172
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:36,180
Mosquitoes. I gota thing
about mosquitoes.

173
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,183
If you're all set, let's go.

174
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,185
We're saved.

175
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,186
A museum in New York

176
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,189
just sent us some
additional backup.

177
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,193
Kelly Scott.

178
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:47,196
Jack Wells.

179
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,197
Hi.

180
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,199
Uh, some museum sent you, huh?

181
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,202
What, are we all
museum bigots in Maine?

182
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:53,203
She's rude sarcastic.

183
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,205
You two should get along.

184
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,208
I'm afraid I can't let you
go with us, ma'am.

185
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,210
Sheriff Keough said I could.

186
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,213
Unfortunately, Fish and Game
supersedes the sheriff.

187
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,215
Why do you have to supersede?
Maybe I might be of--

188
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,216
Ma'am, look,

189
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:06,218
this isn't some kind of
fact-finding expedition.

190
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,222
Yes, I know that.

191
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,223
It's not a science trip.

192
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
Could you be
a little more condescending?

193
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:14,229
'Cause I'm not real great
with subtlety.

194
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,232
Something in that lake
killed somebody, right?

195
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,235
I appreciate
you're trying to help.

196
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:21,238
I'm really glad that you
brought the raid.

197
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,239
Now, that's better.

198
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,241
Ma'am,
it's not gonna work--

199
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,243
If you call me "ma'am"
one more time, I'll sue you,

200
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:26,244
and with today's laws,
it's possible.

201
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:29,248
She's good.

202
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,251
Look, I won't interfere.

203
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:33,253
And if I do, you've got
a sheriff handy to arrest me,

204
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:36,256
but I understand if I threaten
your Fish and Game authority--

205
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,258
Excuse me.

206
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:38,260
Is it true you're going to look

207
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,263
for some kind of monster
in Black Lake?

208
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:43,266
Well, we're just gonna
investigate an accident.

209
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:44,267
There's no monster.

210
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,270
We heard a man was bit in half.

211
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,273
Well, there was an accident.

212
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:52,277
That's all. It's
nothing to worry about.

213
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:58,285
Oh, please.

214
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:02,290
All right. Let's go.

215
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:24,318
Well, my husband passed away.

216
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:27,322
It's been almost 2 years now.

217
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:29,324
My department doesn't
have any record of that,

218
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:31,327
Mrs. Bickerman.

219
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,328
Well, I'm sorry.

220
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:35,332
Incomplete records haunt me so.

221
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:37,335
What was the cause
of your husband's death,

222
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:40,339
ma'am, do you know?

223
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,341
We don't mean
to invade your privacy,

224
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,343
but was he ill?
Was he sick?

225
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,344
Was he swallowed?

226
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,346
Sheriff.

227
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,349
Uh, Mrs. Bickerman,
the reason we're here.

228
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,351
A man was fatally
attacked yesterday

229
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:53,354
by some animal in this lake.

230
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,357
Do you know how your husband died?

231
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,358
Oh, yes.

232
00:15:56,358 --> 00:16:00,364
I killed him.

233
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:01,366
You killed him?

234
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:02,367
Oh, yes.

235
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,368
Uh...

236
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:07,373
and how would you have
accomplished this, ma'am?

237
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:08,374
Well...

238
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:10,377
He was very sick,

239
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:13,380
and--and he refused
to go to a doctor.

240
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,383
He'd be coherent one day
and incoherent the next.

241
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,388
And, well, one coherent day

242
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:20,389
he asked me to end his suffering.

243
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,391
And, um...

244
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:25,395
he kept insisting and insisting

245
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:28,400
and then, well,
finally I just gave in,

246
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,402
and I hit him on the head
with a skillet,

247
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:34,407
then buried him
out at the bulkhead.

248
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,412
Well, dig him up
if you don't believe me,

249
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:42,417
Sherlock.

250
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:49,426
Half mile up
there's a clearing.

251
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,428
What's with the water?
It's so black.

252
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,430
There's no waves or anything.

253
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,434
Well, they wanted to
call it "Lake Placid, "

254
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:59,439
but somebody said
that name was taken.

255
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,443
It's too bad.

256
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,445
Tents were sent ahead.

257
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:05,446
They should already be set up

258
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:07,449
by the time we get there.

259
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:08,450
Tents?

260
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,451
We're staying in tents?

261
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:12,455
I told you, 2 days
we'd have to camp.

262
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:14,457
Yes, camp,

263
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:15,458
but I thought that meant
"Ramada Inn."

264
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,462
I never heard tents.
Will there be toilets?

265
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:19,464
Maybe we should
just take you back.

266
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:22,468
Why, because I prefer a toilet?

267
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:23,469
Oh, God.

268
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:25,472
We forgot to pack
feminine napkins.

269
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:26,473
Oh, so you're with him now?

270
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:27,475
Taking his side.

271
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:29,477
I didn't say a word.

272
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,479
Oh, no, maybe I should
just wipe myself

273
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,482
with some leafy little piece
of poison oak.

274
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:34,483
And then I could
spend the whole day

275
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:37,487
scratching my ass,
blending in with the natives.

276
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:39,489
Then you'd be back on my side.

277
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,492
You know, you really
don't have to bother

278
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,494
telling people
you're from New York.

279
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:44,495
What the hell is that?

280
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:45,496
What?

281
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:49,502
There. I thought
I saw something.

282
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,506
Kelly:
Looks like a branch.

283
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,508
Oh, my God.

284
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,511
Aah!

285
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:57,513
Aah!

286
00:17:57,513 --> 00:17:58,514
Hey.

287
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:00,516
You threw it at me!

288
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:01,517
I just let go of it.

289
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,520
You threw it at me!

290
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,521
Did you see that?
Oh!

291
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:05,522
Ma'am!

292
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,525
Stop hitting me.

293
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:08,526
Don't throw heads at me!

294
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,528
Stop calling me
"ma'am!"

295
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,531
Aw, Jesus.

296
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:13,532
Oh, God.

297
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,536
So, sheriff...

298
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:20,542
how many deputies you got?

299
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:27,551
What?

300
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:32,556
Could it be a bear?

301
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:34,559
I mean, the bears
get big here, right?

302
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,564
Hmm. I don't think a bear
could bite off a moose's head.

303
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,566
Everything you need
should be in there.

304
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:42,569
Ok. Good. Good.

305
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:43,570
So will we be
tent-mates then?

306
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,573
Nope.
This is all yours.

307
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,576
Ohh. Great.

308
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:48,577
Excellent.

309
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:49,579
If there's anything else
you need...

310
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:51,581
Uh, one thing
I wanted to ask you.

311
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:53,583
Uh, what's it like to be a woman

312
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,585
in the woods of Maine?

313
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,589
I mean, the guys don't turn
all horny or anything

314
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,593
like they did in
deliverance, right?

315
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:05,598
Oh.

316
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,601
I knew you were there.

317
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,603
Hmm.

318
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,607
Never been to Maine before, huh?

319
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:15,611
I have good hygiene.
I'm not welcome.

320
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:16,613
Why are you here, really?

321
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,615
I told you.

322
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,618
A museum doesn't send an
investigator into the woods--

323
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,619
How would you know

324
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,620
what a museum would
or would not do exactly?

325
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,622
Well, even if they did,

326
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,627
I doubt whether he or she
would have problems with tents.

327
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,628
So I don't like tents.
Why--

328
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:30,630
Oh, you don't like tents,
and you don't like mosquitoes.

329
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,631
Well, nobody likes
mosquit--

330
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:32,632
Look at your fingernails.

331
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:34,635
What's wrong with my fingernails?

332
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:35,636
You have as much business
being in the woods

333
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,639
as Emily Post.

334
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:38,640
No, it doesn't make sense.

335
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,644
They sent you out here
to examine a tooth.

336
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:45,649
And what are you doing
out here on the lake?

337
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,652
Oh, no.

338
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:50,656
What?

339
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,660
If this is who I think it is...

340
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,661
It is.

341
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,665
Who?

342
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:58,666
Hector Cyr.

343
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,670
He's this rich, kook
mythology professor.

344
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:08,679
You know him?

345
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:10,681
He's done some work
with our museum.

346
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,685
He also treks the world to s...

347
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:14,686
What?

348
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:18,691
To swim with crocodiles.

349
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:22,696
Crocodiles?

350
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:23,697
If he's here,

351
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:26,701
he must think you've got one.

352
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,703
Oh, look...

353
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:29,705
I admit I'm no brain scientist,

354
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:32,708
but I do know there's
no way a crocodile

355
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,715
can be in Maine, right?

356
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,718
You beat me!

357
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,720
Balls!

358
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,721
Splendid lake, eh?

359
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,724
Became a man on a lake like this.

360
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:46,727
Rubber raft.

361
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:48,729
Sylvia Blake.

362
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:50,732
She gave a like a cow.

363
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:51,733
Who do we have
from Fish and Game?

364
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:52,734
Me.

365
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,735
Who is this man?

366
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,737
I can see the algae blooms
Just coming in.

367
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,740
Look almost stagnant.

368
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,742
Hector Cyr.

369
00:20:58,742 --> 00:20:59,743
Oh, the earth is round
and so should you be.

370
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:01,746
Who is he?

371
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:03,748
I need topographic studies.
You got any?

372
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:05,750
You don't just fly in here
and start barking orders.

373
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,754
I apologize. I just don't
want to lose the light

374
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:09,756
when we got time
for a quick scout.

375
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:10,757
Have you had a little work done?

376
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:11,758
I have not.

377
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:12,759
Who are you?

378
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,762
Hector Cyr.
I said it once.

379
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:15,763
Let me know when it sinks in, ok?

380
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:16,765
Have you seen it?

381
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:17,766
No.

382
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,768
Excuse me.
You came here to...

383
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:21,771
help you find it.

384
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:22,772
A crocodile?

385
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:23,773
Yeah.

386
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:25,775
They've been migrating north,
you know?

387
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:26,777
This lake does connect
to the ocean.

388
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:28,781
It's not as farfetched
as it may sound.

389
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:30,783
Crocodiles can't swim
in saltwater.

390
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:33,786
Yeah, well, that'll be
your little secret.

391
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:36,791
Come on.
We're losing time.

392
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,792
Why did the big one heckle me?

393
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:41,796
Hey, pal...

394
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,832
If he's close, we'll find him.

395
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:12,835
Their signatures
are unmistakable.

396
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:16,841
She tell you
that we had sex together?

397
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:17,842
So vigorous!

398
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:19,844
I never had sex with you.

399
00:22:19,844 --> 00:22:22,849
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

400
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:23,850
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

401
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,851
God.

402
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:25,852
Wait.

403
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:26,854
Stop!

404
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,863
Thought I heard something.

405
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:36,866
I don't mean to be discourteous,

406
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:38,869
but, uh, how is it

407
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:40,871
a person could come to believe

408
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,873
a crocodile is in New England?

409
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:44,876
How could it survive winter?

410
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,879
Long as their nostrils
don't freeze,

411
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:47,880
they survive.

412
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,882
Am I foolish to explain things?

413
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:50,884
He had such trouble with my name.

414
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:52,887
- Hector.
- Hey.

415
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:53,888
Is this where it happened?

416
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,890
Around here.
Yeah.

417
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,893
We're a mile from the ocean.
Could've easily made it here.

418
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:58,894
Assuming he got
this far up the seaboard.

419
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:01,898
The big ones
have been on the move.

420
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:03,900
What have I been telling you?
You call me crazy.

421
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,902
Kelly:
Hector, just paddle.

422
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:07,906
You know, Sheriff,

423
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:09,908
when friends or family say things,

424
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:10,909
they tend not to register,

425
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,911
so sometimes it helps to hear it

426
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:13,912
from a total stranger.

427
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:15,916
You're fat.

428
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,919
Jesus. Hector!

429
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,920
Oh, yeah.

430
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,923
Kelly: What's that?

431
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:22,925
What is it?

432
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:25,929
White perch.

433
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:26,930
Are they feeding?

434
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,932
They aren't feeding.

435
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:31,936
They're scared.

436
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,938
-Aah!
-Aah!

437
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:34,939
Jesus!

438
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:35,942
Oh!

439
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:39,947
Oh!

440
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:43,951
Get your legs out of the water.

441
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:44,953
Don't move your legs.

442
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:45,956
Are you kidding me?

443
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:49,960
Keep your legs still.

444
00:23:51,962 --> 00:23:52,963
Get off.

445
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:53,965
Hector, to the left.

446
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,968
Move it left!

447
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:56,969
Paddle, paddle!

448
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,972
No one actually saw anything.

449
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,975
Yes, I realize that, sir,

450
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:02,976
but something flipped us over,

451
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:05,980
and I doubt very much
if it was a mink.

452
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,981
I am a palaeontologist.

453
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,984
I work for
a natural history museum.

454
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:09,985
I am not some--

455
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:11,987
They don't believe her.

456
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:12,989
Thank you.

457
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:14,991
It's so rewarding to
imagine my tax dollar

458
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:16,995
finding its way to you,
you fuck-shit!

459
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:19,998
You're a saucy flirt.

460
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:20,999
You were right.

461
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,001
U.S.Wildlife
won't send anybody

462
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,003
without a confirmation.

463
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:26,006
We don't need 'em.

464
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,007
Sheriff.

465
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,008
Yeah?

466
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:32,013
Might wanna come
take a look at this.

467
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,015
Oh, my God.

468
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,016
Worms.

469
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,019
Oh, I got a thing about worms.

470
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,025
It's a human toe.

471
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:45,029
Some decomposition,
a little acidic--

472
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:49,035
definitely been swallowed.

473
00:24:51,037 --> 00:24:54,040
Is this the man who was killed?

474
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,044
He seemed taller.

475
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,046
Phew.

476
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,047
You got a croc, all right.

477
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,049
They're a keystone species.

478
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,052
Did he just explain something?

479
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:06,056
Keystone species effects
the whole ecosystem.

480
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:08,059
That would explain these worms

481
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:11,063
and those perch.

482
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:14,066
We got a crocodile.

483
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:18,072
Here's your friend.

484
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,093
Tom Jones:
It's not unusual.

485
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:37,096
To be loved by anyone

486
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:40,100
It's not unusual.

487
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,104
To have fun with anyone.

488
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:46,107
But when I see you hangin' around

489
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:49,111
With anyone.

490
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:50,112
It's not unusual...

491
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:51,113
He paid us.

492
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:53,115
500.

493
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:54,116
It's a trap.

494
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:58,122
You accepted money from him?

495
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:02,127
We took a check.

496
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,131
When I see you out and about.

497
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:07,134
Law enforcement
is very dangerous work,

498
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,135
isn't it?

499
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:11,139
And you have such
big, wonderful boobs.

500
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:13,141
Ha ha. Thank you.

501
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:14,142
It's not unusual.

502
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,145
It happens every day.

503
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:17,146
Hey!

504
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:20,150
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!

505
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,151
You're on official business.

506
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:23,153
This is not a party.

507
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,155
Yeah, but now that you're here...

508
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,158
Whoo!

509
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:27,159
Yeah!

510
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,160
Quiet!

511
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:33,167
What's with digging the holes?

512
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,169
Well, crocodiles are--

513
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:37,172
are very brazen.

514
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:39,174
They like to come on land,

515
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:41,177
and of course
they're attracted to noise.

516
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,179
Everybody out!
Back to your tents!

517
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:44,180
Now!

518
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,183
Oh, could she stay?

519
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:47,184
We were...

520
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:48,185
we were hoping to mate.

521
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:50,188
No.

522
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:54,192
Out.

523
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:55,193
Now, you listen...

524
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,199
If it were up to me,
you'd be on your way home.

525
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,200
But I'm not in charge.

526
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,202
That's a shocker there.

527
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,204
I'm going to say this

528
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,209
because I believe in being
straight with people.

529
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,212
I think you are a mental.

530
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:12,216
Sheriff...

531
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,218
I appreciate your candor.
Really, I do.

532
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:16,221
I think it's always good to know

533
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:18,223
where somebody's coming from,

534
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:19,225
and, frankly,

535
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:23,229
your origins have been
a bit of a mystery to me.

536
00:27:41,252 --> 00:27:44,256
Look how flat that water is.

537
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,260
You could get 10 skips
on a good one, easy.

538
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,261
Sorry?

539
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:52,267
Skipping stones.

540
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:53,268
Growing up,

541
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:55,270
I used to summer
At my grandparents' place

542
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,274
on a lake like this.

543
00:27:57,274 --> 00:28:00,277
I'd skip stones all day.

544
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,279
Beat playing with the other kids.

545
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:06,285
I'm sure it did.

546
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:09,288
Look, I think it's best

547
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,290
if you stayed onshore a while.

548
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,292
I beg your pardon?

549
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,294
I'm not trying to pick a fight,

550
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:16,297
but whatever's out there
did flip a canoe.

551
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:18,300
I am not staying onshore.

552
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,303
It's dangerous.

553
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:22,305
No, I didn't fly up here
Just to roast marshmallows.

554
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:24,307
Why did you fly up here?

555
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:25,309
Look...

556
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,312
palaeontologists are not
sent to Maine

557
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:28,313
to hunt for crocodiles.

558
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:30,315
I was sent up here
to look at the tooth.

559
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:32,317
You looked at the tooth.

560
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:36,323
What are you doing out here?

561
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,327
I was dating my boss...

562
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:44,332
and he turned out to be
involved with a co worker

563
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:46,336
who was also my friend.

564
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:48,338
And for the sake
of comfort--theirs--

565
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:50,341
I was shipped off to Maine.

566
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:54,345
And I don't feel
like going back yet.

567
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:59,352
I'm not making it up.

568
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:00,353
Still, you don't
have to stay out here.

569
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,355
I mean, you can stay in town.

570
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:04,357
I've come. I'm here.
I'm staying...

571
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:05,360
unless there are ticks.

572
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,362
I know crocodiles.

573
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,364
And I won't get in your way.

574
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:13,370
I just really do want
to be a part of this.

575
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,377
7:00 A.M.?

576
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:23,382
Thank you.

577
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,392
Good night.

578
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:35,397
Thank you.

579
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,525
Jesus fucking Christ!

580
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,527
Ohh. What the hell
are you doing?

581
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:18,528
What the hell are you doing?!

582
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,529
Oh, Jesus.
You clowning around?

583
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:20,530
I'm laying a spring trap!

584
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,531
A spring trap?

585
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:23,534
I keep telling you
they can come on land.

586
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:25,537
I could've shot you.

587
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:27,539
This could end up
saving your life,

588
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,540
which is meaningful for you,

589
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,544
because the more you live,

590
00:31:30,544 --> 00:31:32,546
the more sex you get to
have with your sister!

591
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:33,547
What's going on?

592
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:35,550
He's crawling around
like a cockroach here.

593
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,551
I don't care
how much money--

594
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:38,554
He's waving
his little wang around!

595
00:31:38,554 --> 00:31:39,555
He's scaring the shit out of me!

596
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:40,556
How big is this?

597
00:31:40,556 --> 00:31:41,557
All right, all right!

598
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,559
I'll say this once.

599
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,560
Your fancy equipment aside,

600
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,564
which we appreciate--

601
00:31:46,564 --> 00:31:49,567
if you interfere, you're gone.

602
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:53,572
Simple as that.

603
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:59,580
How much of a wacko is this guy?

604
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,583
Well...

605
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,585
the thing about Hector

606
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:05,588
is he takes this
crocodile business very...

607
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:07,590
Oh, man.

608
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,593
He thinks they're godly.

609
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:11,595
What was that?

610
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:12,596
In his defence,

611
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,598
every primitive culture
known to man deified them.

612
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:17,603
Ancient China, Egypt,
Australia, Asia.

613
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,605
Going back in history,

614
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,607
crocodiles have been
more worshipped than Jesus.

615
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,610
Is this supposed to make us

616
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,612
take him more seriously?

617
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:26,615
No, it's supposed to make you
understand him.

618
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:28,617
He's a mythology professor.

619
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:30,619
He believes
that they're divine conduits.

620
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,622
And he can find them,

621
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:33,623
so we should try
to put up with him.

622
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:36,627
He's a fruitcake.

623
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:38,630
We should get some sleep.

624
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,631
Yeah.

625
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:40,632
Aah!

626
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:41,633
Damn it!

627
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:45,638
And he's a good trapper.

628
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:08,667
We can expect a quick response

629
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:09,669
if he hears that.

630
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:13,673
Adult crocs will move
on distressed hatchlings.

631
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:14,674
Again, I don't mean to be annoying

632
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:16,678
with my questions

633
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:17,679
but if it is a crocodile,

634
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,682
which I don't think it is,

635
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:22,685
and they do charge these
baby hatchling sounds,

636
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:25,690
why would you want to be
underwater at the time?

637
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,692
With you, it makes sense.

638
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:28,693
You see, Sheriff, the thing is,

639
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:29,694
they don't really
attack underwater.

640
00:33:29,694 --> 00:33:31,696
That Walt guy got hit underwater.

641
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:33,699
True. They don't see
that well underwater.

642
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:35,702
They have nictitating
lenses on their eyes...

643
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:37,704
Burke, stop here.

644
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:38,705
- Now?
-Yeah.

645
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:40,708
...You dive underwater

646
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,709
and they probably won't
be able to see you.

647
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,711
I hate to interrupt
but we got work to do.

648
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:45,714
Hey, we can talk if we want.

649
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:47,718
Yeah, we can talk if we want.

650
00:33:47,718 --> 00:33:51,722
Would you mind putting down
the anchor?

651
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,727
Wait till we're down there

652
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:56,729
before you turn that thing on.

653
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:58,731
Got it.

654
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:01,734
Let's go, Hector.

655
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:05,740
Good luck.

656
00:34:12,748 --> 00:34:15,753
I brought a pork chop for luck.

657
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,756
Maybe you can hang it
around you neck.

658
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,758
That's sweet.

659
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,760
Maybe later you can chew the bark

660
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,766
off my big, fat log.

661
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:32,774
Was that, like,
a homosexual remark?

662
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:38,781
Don't ask me.

663
00:35:26,843 --> 00:35:28,845
Could be a mental.

664
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:30,847
I heard if a mental person
is rich enough,

665
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:31,848
they just call him eccentric.

666
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:33,851
He's not mental.

667
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:35,855
He's seen every crocodile
in the world.

668
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:37,857
He even swam in the Grametti
with killer Niles.

669
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:39,859
He never got nipped.

670
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,862
And that's why he thinks
they're godly--

671
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:42,863
'Cause they don't bite him?

672
00:35:42,863 --> 00:35:44,866
I don't know.

673
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:46,868
He said he knew it when
he looked in their eyes.

674
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:50,873
"Eyes of a Dragon."

675
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:57,959
So much for crocodiles.

676
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:03,965
It's probably on land.

677
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:07,971
Yeah, right.

678
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:09,973
What was that?

679
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:12,977
I don't know.

680
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,980
Aah!

681
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,981
Shit.

682
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:18,984
Hey! Something's got
the anchor line!

683
00:37:18,984 --> 00:37:20,987
Untie it!
Untie the line!

684
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:21,988
I'm trying!

685
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:22,989
Hurry!

686
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:23,990
Cut the line!

687
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,994
Right!

688
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,997
Shit!

689
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,000
Come on.

690
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,001
What happened?

691
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:34,003
I don't know.

692
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:37,008
Hurry. Hurry up.

693
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,015
Must've just let go.

694
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:47,020
Come on.

695
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,022
Shit! Hurry!

696
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:52,027
Hank!

697
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:58,034
Ok!

698
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:08,047
Oh!

699
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:14,054
Hurry!

700
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:17,058
Hurry.

701
00:38:17,058 --> 00:38:21,064
My God, it's right under you!

702
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:26,070
Aah! Oh, Christ.

703
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,071
Come on, get in the boat.

704
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,074
You all right?

705
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,075
Yeah.

706
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,077
Where's Hector?

707
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,079
I lost track.

708
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,085
We went different directions.

709
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,097
There's some bubbles over there.

710
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:57,109
Pull it up.

711
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:01,114
All right. Come on.
Bring him aboard.

712
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:02,115
What's happened?

713
00:39:02,115 --> 00:39:03,116
Come on.

714
00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:05,119
You see it?
How big is it?

715
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,122
Shut up and get on board.

716
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:09,124
We lost track of it.
Burke, pull up the speaker!

717
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:13,128
Are you all right?

718
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:25,145
-Grab him!
-Aah!

719
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:27,147
Pull him in!

720
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,149
Pull him in!

721
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:32,153
Aah! Aah!

722
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:33,154
That it?

723
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:36,158
Yeah.

724
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:38,161
Nobody actually saw it.
It happened suddenly.

725
00:39:38,161 --> 00:39:41,165
Didn't get caught in the outboard?

726
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:45,171
It wasn't the outboard.

727
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:55,183
Tell them to get here fast, huh?

728
00:39:57,185 --> 00:40:00,189
You ok?

729
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,192
Kelly?

730
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,196
Yeah.

731
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,199
Nobody saw anything.

732
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:11,203
No.

733
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,205
U.S.Wildlife's
on their way.

734
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:15,208
The police want to keep
everything quiet

735
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,213
so the press doesn't
get wind of anything.

736
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:21,216
Everybody just wants us to...

737
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:25,222
"Sit tight"

738
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:33,231
Are you...ok?

739
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,233
Well...

740
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:38,239
you know...

741
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,243
Yeah.

742
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:47,250
Well, Sheriff, I'm, uh...

743
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,254
Very sorry about your deputy.

744
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:54,259
He was a good man?

745
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:58,263
Yep.

746
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:00,265
Whenever somebody dies, I...

747
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:02,268
I always think
that it's such a waste

748
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:05,273
that I didn't know them
any better.

749
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:09,278
Sorry for your loss, Hector.

750
00:41:09,278 --> 00:41:13,282
Not really what I meant.

751
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:17,288
Head was just...

752
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:21,292
bitten off.

753
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,294
You know, I used to have
a recurring nightmare

754
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:25,298
that I was headless.

755
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:26,299
I'd be down on the ground

756
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:28,301
looking up at my body, no head,

757
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:31,305
just walking around
bumping into everything.

758
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:33,308
And my parents...

759
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:35,311
wouldn't let me in the house.

760
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:37,313
Because they just bought
all these antique lamps,

761
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:38,314
and they didn't want me
to knock them over,

762
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:39,316
the fuckers.

763
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:42,319
Then the neighbourhood bullies,

764
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,320
they'd see my round
head on the ground

765
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,323
looking like a ball,

766
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:46,324
and they'd come over,

767
00:41:46,324 --> 00:41:48,327
and they'd start a soccer game.

768
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:49,328
And as I was being kicked around,

769
00:41:49,328 --> 00:41:51,330
I'd actually just feel grateful

770
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:55,336
for being allowed in the game.

771
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:58,340
What are--
What are your thoughts?

772
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,343
You know, Hector...

773
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,346
I'm sure you're a fine person

774
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:06,350
in your own mental way,

775
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,351
but I think it would be best

776
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:11,356
if you and I didn't speak.

777
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:15,361
Yaaah!

778
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:18,365
When is U.S.Wildlife
getting here?

779
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:22,369
I'm still waiting
to confirm if they...

780
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,376
Oh, Jesus.

781
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,378
I--I could probably
cut him down,

782
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:31,381
but there's this
odd look of mayhem

783
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:34,386
on his
upside-down face.

784
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,387
Hank.

785
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:36,388
Yes?

786
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,390
Are you all right?

787
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,394
Could you cut me down?

788
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:42,395
Do you promise

789
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:43,396
that you won't attempt
to injure me?

790
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:46,400
I have no interest in ever
looking at you, Hector.

791
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,404
Ok.

792
00:42:49,404 --> 00:42:51,406
Just, uh, pull him down.

793
00:42:51,406 --> 00:42:55,413
It's a counterweight.

794
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:56,414
Here. I'll get the knife.

795
00:42:56,414 --> 00:42:58,416
If I'd remembered it was there,

796
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,418
I never would've let
you walk that way.

797
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:01,419
I never would've let
you walk that way.

798
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,422
All right. It's over.

799
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:04,424
It's over. Remember?

800
00:43:04,424 --> 00:43:06,426
You promised
not to hurt him, so...

801
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:08,428
I lied.

802
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:09,429
Wait. Hey! Hey!

803
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,432
Come on! Hold up!

804
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:12,433
Nowhere to go, my friend.

805
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:15,437
Now, just--come on!
Knock it off.

806
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:16,438
Knock it off.
Put that down.

807
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:17,439
Just settle...

808
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:22,446
Jesus! Look out!

809
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:25,450
Whoa!

810
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,465
Aw, shit!

811
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:56,490
Ok.

812
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,492
I admit it.

813
00:43:58,492 --> 00:44:01,495
It's a crocodile.

814
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:03,498
Kelly: He's an Indo-Pacific.

815
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:06,502
Scales were oval.
He's an Asian crocodile.

816
00:44:06,502 --> 00:44:09,505
Why would he come here?
It's impossible.

817
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:11,508
Asia.
How would he get here?

818
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:13,511
Obviously some
asshole in Hong Kong

819
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:14,513
flushed him down the toilet.

820
00:44:14,513 --> 00:44:16,515
He was 30 feet, right?
Had to be.

821
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:19,519
Well, now maybe somebody's
happy I brought my big gun.

822
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:21,521
Oh you're gonna
blow him away now?

823
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:22,522
I should think so.

824
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:23,524
With your cannon?

825
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:24,525
Right.
What, I shouldn't?

826
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:25,526
Well, he's a miracle of nature,

827
00:44:25,526 --> 00:44:27,529
but I know he's very scary.

828
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:29,531
You're the miracle of nature.

829
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:31,533
Guys, guys, easy.

830
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:33,536
We're not gonna do
anything tonight.

831
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:36,540
I never heard of a crocodile
crossing an ocean.

832
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,542
Well, they conceal information

833
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,543
like that in books.

834
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,544
All right, pal!

835
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,546
Hey, hey, hey.

836
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,551
No, no.
Let him go.

837
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:45,552
I'm sick of him, too.

838
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:46,553
I do need to warn you, Sheriff.

839
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:48,555
The thing about being rich,

840
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:49,557
my parents did have
the added luxury

841
00:44:49,557 --> 00:44:50,558
of ditching me off
at karate school

842
00:44:50,558 --> 00:44:52,560
on a regular basis,
so I am a brown belt.

843
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,564
Go ahead.
Take your best shot.

844
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:56,565
Ohh!

845
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:57,567
Hank!

846
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:59,569
He said he knew karate.

847
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:00,570
You hit him.

848
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,571
I did, yeah.

849
00:45:01,571 --> 00:45:03,574
Here.

850
00:45:03,574 --> 00:45:05,577
Did he say "go"?

851
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,580
Aren't you supposed
to say "go" in karate?

852
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,582
You're supposed
to say "go."

853
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,586
Hank, just keep your
distance from him.

854
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,590
Go to your tent.
Cool down.

855
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,592
He doesn't answer my questions?

856
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:19,594
Why don't you answer my questions?

857
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:20,596
I fall into a hole.

858
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,598
I go up in a tree.

859
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:23,600
I swear to God,
I'll say "go."

860
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,601
You bow,
and then you say "go."

861
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:25,602
As in
"go fuck yourself."

862
00:45:25,602 --> 00:45:28,606
Jesus. They're just
like children.

863
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:29,607
Yeah.

864
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,609
Oh, my God.

865
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:33,612
Are you all right?

866
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:35,615
Yeah, I'm all right.

867
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,617
I've got something for that.

868
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:37,618
I can fix that.

869
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:38,619
Yeah?

870
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:39,620
Yeah.

871
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,621
Ohh!

872
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:43,626
I just gotta pull it
a little tighter.

873
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,628
There we go.

874
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:47,630
Who taught you to be a nurse?

875
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:48,631
Father's a surgeon.

876
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:50,634
I can even stitch in a pinch,

877
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,636
which probably wouldn't
be such a bad idea.

878
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:54,639
Uh, no, thanks.

879
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:56,641
Ok.

880
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,645
You should have seen
the look on your face

881
00:45:59,645 --> 00:46:02,648
when that croc jumped out.

882
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:03,651
Uh-huh.

883
00:46:03,651 --> 00:46:05,654
You see the look on the bear?

884
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:09,658
That was the look.

885
00:46:09,658 --> 00:46:11,660
I don't know.

886
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,664
The laws of nature
could be changing, Jack.

887
00:46:13,664 --> 00:46:14,665
That thing out there,
that's--

888
00:46:14,665 --> 00:46:18,669
You're having the best time
of your life, aren't you?

889
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:20,672
What?

890
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:21,673
What? People
have been killed.

891
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:24,677
I hardly think I'm
having a good time.

892
00:46:24,677 --> 00:46:28,682
Why would you--

893
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:32,687
Does it show?

894
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,695
This is the first time
I've ever actually...

895
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,698
you know, been in
the middle of anything.

896
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,699
Is that why you're here,

897
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:46,705
to get in the middle
of something?

898
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:51,711
Maybe.

899
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:53,714
I've always read
about what's happened.

900
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:57,718
I've never...

901
00:47:00,723 --> 00:47:03,727
We should go to bed.

902
00:47:03,727 --> 00:47:06,731
I mean we should go to, uh...

903
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:07,732
rest.

904
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:10,735
We should go to our
separate tents,

905
00:47:10,735 --> 00:47:13,739
and--here--
get some--go.

906
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:17,744
I got it.

907
00:47:20,747 --> 00:47:24,753
Thanks for the bandage.

908
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:26,756
Night.

909
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:30,761
Yeah.

910
00:47:39,772 --> 00:47:43,777
It doesn't even see him.

911
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,783
There, he got it.

912
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,785
He has one natural enemy.

913
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,791
Only one.

914
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:54,792
Man?

915
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:57,795
Man.

916
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:58,796
So you're the big expert.

917
00:47:58,796 --> 00:48:01,800
You think ours is some
kind of mutant or---

918
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,804
Not necessarily.
There's a 30-footer in India.

919
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:07,808
Biggest one ever killed
on record was 27 feet.

920
00:48:07,808 --> 00:48:10,811
So why is he here?

921
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:14,817
Honestly...

922
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:20,824
I don't know.

923
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:42,851
Keep your eyes peeled.

924
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:45,856
You know how fast
these things can be.

925
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,859
I've got ticks, I know it.

926
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:48,860
They're just so drawn to me.

927
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,862
I gota thing about ticks.

928
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:53,867
Crawling up your pant leg.

929
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:55,869
Putt heir heads under your skin.

930
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:57,871
Look.

931
00:48:57,871 --> 00:48:58,872
What?

932
00:48:58,872 --> 00:49:02,877
Jack.

933
00:49:07,883 --> 00:49:11,888
That's a pretty big print.

934
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:19,899
Seems like
we're getting lower.

935
00:49:19,899 --> 00:49:21,901
That's what happens when I land.

936
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:23,905
Why are we landing?

937
00:49:23,905 --> 00:49:27,909
Because this is the cove
that he obviously lives in.

938
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:30,912
So why are we landing?

939
00:49:30,912 --> 00:49:34,918
Hector!

940
00:49:40,925 --> 00:49:41,926
We can lift it?

941
00:49:41,926 --> 00:49:43,930
Maybe.

942
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:44,931
Don't want to mush it there.

943
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:46,934
I'm not mushing it.

944
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:49,937
You might mush it.
It's a little soft.

945
00:49:49,937 --> 00:49:53,943
For Christ's sake,
I'm not mushing it!

946
00:49:54,944 --> 00:49:56,946
Aah!

947
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:57,947
Aah!

948
00:49:57,947 --> 00:49:58,948
Aah!

949
00:49:58,948 --> 00:49:59,949
Aah!

950
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:01,952
Oh, God.

951
00:50:01,952 --> 00:50:03,955
Ok.

952
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:05,957
That is it!
That is it!

953
00:50:05,957 --> 00:50:08,960
No, no, I keep
getting hit with heads!

954
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,963
Try to calm down.

955
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:10,964
You calm down!

956
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:13,968
Calm down, ok?
Just keep breathing.

957
00:50:13,968 --> 00:50:16,972
I'm being very calm!
I am composed!

958
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:17,973
This is the second time.

959
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:18,974
I've been hit
with a severed head,

960
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,977
and it upsets me!

961
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,983
What the hell?

962
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:30,988
Aah!

963
00:50:30,988 --> 00:50:31,990
I...

964
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,994
I just want to go back
to my tent now.

965
00:50:34,994 --> 00:50:37,998
Can we please go back?

966
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:40,001
You gotta be kidding.

967
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:43,005
I'm not kidding!

968
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:44,006
Look.

969
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:45,007
The itsy-bitsy spider.

970
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:47,009
Crawled up the water spout.

971
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:49,012
Down comes the rain.

972
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:53,017
To wash the spider out.

973
00:50:56,021 --> 00:50:58,023
Kelly: What is she doing?

974
00:50:58,023 --> 00:51:01,026
Dum de dum de dum.

975
00:51:01,026 --> 00:51:02,027
Kelly: Oh.

976
00:51:02,027 --> 00:51:04,032
What?

977
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:08,036
Look 10 feet into the water.

978
00:51:16,046 --> 00:51:18,049
Come and get it!

979
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,063
Wow.

980
00:51:30,063 --> 00:51:32,066
Disgusting.

981
00:51:32,066 --> 00:51:34,070
I haven't broken any laws.

982
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,071
Oh, but you have, ma'am.

983
00:51:35,071 --> 00:51:36,072
You lied to us.

984
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:38,074
That can be
obstruction of justice.

985
00:51:38,074 --> 00:51:39,075
A man has been killed,

986
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:41,078
in part because of your silence.

987
00:51:41,078 --> 00:51:42,079
I could make out a charge

988
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,081
of reckless endangerment.

989
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:44,082
And I'm sure PETA
would be annoyed

990
00:51:44,082 --> 00:51:47,085
at how you treat your cows.

991
00:51:47,085 --> 00:51:49,088
The reason I lied,
if I told you the truth,

992
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:50,089
you'd hunt it down and kill it,

993
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:52,091
which seems to be exactly
what you're trying to do.

994
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:54,094
How long have you
been feeding this thing?

995
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:56,097
6 years.

996
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:58,099
6 years?

997
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:01,103
Well, Bernie was out fishing,

998
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:03,106
and it followed him home.

999
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:05,109
So we threw it some scraps,

1000
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:07,111
and, well, he didn't
seem to bother anybody.

1001
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:10,114
He became kind of like a pet
who lives in the wild.

1002
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:11,116
He just appeared?

1003
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:13,119
You have no idea
how he arrived here?

1004
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,121
No. Do you?

1005
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:17,123
Your husband Bernie,

1006
00:52:17,123 --> 00:52:18,124
you didn't, by any chance,

1007
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:20,127
lead him to the lake blindfolded?

1008
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:21,128
If I had a dick,

1009
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:24,132
this is where I'd
tell you to suck it.

1010
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:26,136
Did the crocodile
kill your husband?

1011
00:52:26,136 --> 00:52:29,139
Yes, but it was all...

1012
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:30,140
it was a mistake.

1013
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,142
A mistake?

1014
00:52:32,142 --> 00:52:35,147
One of our horses
got loose 2 years ago.

1015
00:52:35,147 --> 00:52:37,149
Went to the lake to drink,

1016
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:39,151
and the crocodile
started coming in,

1017
00:52:39,151 --> 00:52:41,153
and Bernie went
to intercede, and--

1018
00:52:41,153 --> 00:52:43,157
if I'd reported it,

1019
00:52:43,157 --> 00:52:46,160
they'd have sent people
to kill it.

1020
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,162
Ma'am, how could you
not report this?

1021
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:49,164
It puts human life at risk.

1022
00:52:49,164 --> 00:52:51,166
Nobody lives on this lake.

1023
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:55,172
It's really his lake now.

1024
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,176
Come on, Hector.
I know you're crazy,

1025
00:52:58,176 --> 00:52:59,177
but you can't do this.

1026
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,179
I need to see his habitat
up close, Deputy Gare.

1027
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,182
Then watch Nova, ok?

1028
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:06,186
But don't go in the water.

1029
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:07,187
Please.

1030
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,189
I'll have sex with you.

1031
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,190
Let's just get out of here.

1032
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,191
Darling,

1033
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:15,197
he's not gonna hurt me.

1034
00:53:15,197 --> 00:53:19,201
Don't.

1035
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,215
Hector!

1036
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:32,218
Murders and rapes in the cities.

1037
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:34,221
People bomb planes.

1038
00:53:34,221 --> 00:53:36,224
Can the police stop them?
No.

1039
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:38,226
But feed one little cow
to a crocodile--

1040
00:53:38,226 --> 00:53:40,228
You stay right here
until the police show.

1041
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,231
You're under full house arrest.

1042
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:43,233
Thank you...

1043
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:45,235
Officer Fuckmeat.

1044
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:47,237
Sheriff,
we gota problem with Hector.

1045
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:49,240
What problem?

1046
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,246
He went swimming.

1047
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:57,250
Check.

1048
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,339
Oh, my.

1049
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:16,351
Suddenly I feel
a bit foolish here.

1050
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:20,355
You're different from the others.

1051
00:55:21,357 --> 00:55:25,362
Holy Spirit of Sobek.

1052
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:26,363
Holy Ghost.

1053
00:55:26,363 --> 00:55:29,367
Holy shit.

1054
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,369
Hector!

1055
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,373
Just turn the ignition.

1056
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:38,379
It's fuel injected.

1057
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:42,384
Come on!

1058
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:46,389
I know that under
the circumstances,

1059
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:47,390
biting my head off

1060
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,392
might seem viable.

1061
00:55:49,392 --> 00:55:53,398
It would cheapen you.

1062
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,402
I may get a shot!

1063
00:55:57,402 --> 00:55:58,403
No!

1064
00:55:58,403 --> 00:56:00,406
Bullets might not
penetrate its hide.

1065
00:56:00,406 --> 00:56:02,409
Oh, Jesus. All right,
just a little further.

1066
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,411
Just like that.

1067
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:23,436
Move over!

1068
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:28,441
Go!

1069
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:32,448
-Go!
- I'm trying!

1070
00:56:32,448 --> 00:56:34,450
Ahh! Jesus!

1071
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,487
That's your last little
stunt, Mr. Crocodile.

1072
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:04,489
You're grounded.

1073
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:05,490
This is some very
delicate equipment

1074
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,491
that you're throwing around.

1075
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,494
I don't care.
You trying to kill your self.

1076
00:57:08,494 --> 00:57:10,496
You want to meet
Your maker, is that it?

1077
00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:11,497
You might think they're godly,

1078
00:57:11,497 --> 00:57:13,500
you might get some spiritual lift

1079
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,501
out of backstroking with dragons,

1080
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:17,505
but you just put a deputy
at risk out there, sir.

1081
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:19,507
Let's not overlook the fact
that he didn't eat me.

1082
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:22,511
'Cause he just ate a cow, stupid.

1083
00:57:22,511 --> 00:57:24,514
I'm a civilian.
I'm not a trout.

1084
00:57:24,514 --> 00:57:25,515
You have no authority
over me whatsoever.

1085
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:27,518
You have no authority
over me whatsoever.

1086
00:57:27,518 --> 00:57:28,519
Hey, hey, I can arrest you.

1087
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,523
Well, then do it.

1088
00:57:31,523 --> 00:57:33,526
You hurt his feelings.

1089
00:57:33,526 --> 00:57:35,528
I don't care.
Do you care?

1090
00:57:35,528 --> 00:57:39,533
No. He's an asshole.

1091
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,553
Did you want to be killed by it?

1092
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:56,555
You think I'm that nuts?

1093
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:57,556
Hector.

1094
00:57:57,556 --> 00:57:59,558
What you just did,

1095
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:02,563
there had to be at least some
sort of a death wish going on.

1096
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,565
In ancient Melanesia,

1097
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,567
people suspected of crimes

1098
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:09,571
would be thrown
to the crocodiles.

1099
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:10,572
Crocodiles would decide.

1100
00:58:10,572 --> 00:58:12,575
They would be the judge.

1101
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:16,580
Oh, and so that was you
wanting to be judged out there?

1102
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,582
Maybe I was, and so what?

1103
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,584
Is that too arbitrary?

1104
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:23,589
Better to be measured by my wealth?

1105
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:25,592
Better for me
to get my self-esteem

1106
00:58:25,592 --> 00:58:27,594
looking in the eyes
of cheap sycophants

1107
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:28,595
craving a meal ticket?

1108
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:30,597
There was more honesty
in those dragon's eyes.

1109
00:58:30,597 --> 00:58:32,601
There was more dignity
in those dragon's eyes.

1110
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:33,602
Jesus, Hector, cut the shit.

1111
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:35,604
Aw, fuck it.

1112
00:58:35,604 --> 00:58:39,609
So, can I tell them you won't
go back in the water?

1113
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:40,610
Oh, yeah, sure.

1114
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,611
I'm not going back in the water.

1115
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:43,614
No way I'm going
back in the water.

1116
00:58:43,614 --> 00:58:45,616
Ok.

1117
00:58:45,616 --> 00:58:49,622
Kelly.

1118
00:58:50,623 --> 00:58:54,629
We can't let'em kill it.

1119
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:04,641
Yeah,
pull all the trucks in

1120
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,643
and start packing.

1121
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:07,644
Everything?

1122
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:08,645
Yeah.

1123
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,647
All right.

1124
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:12,651
Just heard from Wildlife
and Florida Fish and Game.

1125
00:59:12,651 --> 00:59:13,652
They're gonna be here in 3 hours.

1126
00:59:13,652 --> 00:59:15,654
Ok.

1127
00:59:15,654 --> 00:59:17,658
So we might as well pack up.

1128
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:19,660
Good idea.

1129
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,664
Will they try to trap him?

1130
00:59:22,664 --> 00:59:23,665
Sorry?

1131
00:59:23,665 --> 00:59:25,668
Florida Fish and Game.

1132
00:59:25,668 --> 00:59:27,670
What'll they do
when they get here?

1133
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:31,675
Tell her, Jack.

1134
00:59:31,675 --> 00:59:34,679
Won't be able to snag him
in pitments, right?

1135
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:36,681
And you tranq him in the water,

1136
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:37,682
and he drowns.

1137
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:39,684
They could try
to tranq him on land.

1138
00:59:39,684 --> 00:59:41,688
Oh, sure, they could,
but they won't.

1139
00:59:41,688 --> 00:59:42,689
He's taken human life.

1140
00:59:42,689 --> 00:59:43,691
The mission will be
to put him down.

1141
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:45,693
Is that true?

1142
00:59:45,693 --> 00:59:49,698
They've never been able
to trap anything 30 feet.

1143
00:59:49,698 --> 00:59:51,701
But they have to try, right?

1144
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,703
Where are they gonna
take him, Florida?

1145
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:54,704
Back to Asia?

1146
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:56,707
I got enough flaxidyl
with me to put him out--

1147
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:57,708
Forget it.

1148
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:00,711
Jack, hear me out.

1149
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:01,713
I know I'm a fat,
rich, nut fuck, wacko

1150
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:03,716
who's about as grounded
as a street pigeon,

1151
01:00:03,716 --> 01:00:05,718
Keep going.

1152
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:07,720
But this thing...

1153
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,722
Here?

1154
01:00:09,722 --> 01:00:12,728
Maine?

1155
01:00:12,728 --> 01:00:13,729
30 feet?

1156
01:00:13,729 --> 01:00:15,731
Don't you think we're dealing

1157
01:00:15,731 --> 01:00:17,733
with a bit of a miracle?

1158
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:19,736
Yeah. The miracle would be
to take him alive.

1159
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:21,739
Yeah, but if we could
neutralize him--

1160
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:22,740
How are we gonna neutralize him?

1161
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,742
Lure him on land
and pump him full of drugs.

1162
01:00:24,742 --> 01:00:25,744
Oh, right.

1163
01:00:25,744 --> 01:00:27,746
I know of an empty
oil tank in Portland.

1164
01:00:27,746 --> 01:00:29,748
If we drugged him, we
could contain him there.

1165
01:00:29,748 --> 01:00:31,751
He's 150 years old.

1166
01:00:31,751 --> 01:00:35,756
He probably swam here
from another continent.

1167
01:00:35,756 --> 01:00:37,759
He's migrated to Maine.

1168
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,762
How the hell do we say
we just kill it?

1169
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,766
Jack, this thing being here

1170
01:00:42,766 --> 01:00:44,768
does have some
ecological significance.

1171
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:46,770
And you are in the business

1172
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,773
of protecting things
against extinction.

1173
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:50,775
Including deputies.

1174
01:00:50,775 --> 01:00:51,777
I understand that,

1175
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:53,779
but if it's possible
to take him alive--

1176
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:54,780
No, it's not possible.

1177
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,783
Look, he follows anything
that moves, right?

1178
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:59,786
We seta trap on the beach.
I got enough net--

1179
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,789
No. There's no net
that's gonna hold him.

1180
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:02,790
It'll keep him
tangled long enough

1181
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,793
for the drugs to kick in.

1182
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:05,795
For God's sake, Jack,

1183
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:07,797
they've trapped crocs
bigger than 20 feet.

1184
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:10,800
This is not completely
out of the question.

1185
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,803
It's possible, and you know that.

1186
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:13,805
And those fucks from
Florida won't even try,

1187
01:01:13,805 --> 01:01:16,808
and you know that, too.

1188
01:01:16,808 --> 01:01:18,810
I got the drugs.
He's gota big cannon

1189
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:21,815
if anything goes wrong.

1190
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:23,817
How do you get him to the net?

1191
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:25,819
Ask Mrs. Bickerman
to call him?

1192
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:26,821
You guys can be in the trucks

1193
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:27,822
with the tranq guns.

1194
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:28,823
If he charges, you take off.

1195
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,825
He's not that fast.

1196
01:01:30,825 --> 01:01:34,832
We just have to try.

1197
01:01:34,832 --> 01:01:38,836
One try.
Just one try.

1198
01:01:39,837 --> 01:01:40,838
Like Hank says,

1199
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:43,843
how would we lure him in?

1200
01:01:43,843 --> 01:01:45,845
I'll sue you!

1201
01:01:45,845 --> 01:01:46,846
Go ahead.

1202
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:50,851
You can't take a cow
by eminent domain!

1203
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:51,853
We just did!

1204
01:01:51,853 --> 01:01:54,856
We won't let her get hurt, ma'am.

1205
01:01:54,856 --> 01:01:56,858
You're all cock suckers!

1206
01:01:56,858 --> 01:01:59,863
I knew at first.
I just didn't want to say it.

1207
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:01,866
We know what we're doing.

1208
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:06,872
We gota cow hanging
from a helicopter.

1209
01:02:07,873 --> 01:02:08,874
Not much drag.

1210
01:02:08,874 --> 01:02:12,880
As long as I can keep her
from swinging, we're ok.

1211
01:02:18,886 --> 01:02:21,891
We're doing the right thing.

1212
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:23,893
You might feel different
if you get eaten.

1213
01:02:23,893 --> 01:02:27,899
Yeah, thanks.

1214
01:02:38,912 --> 01:02:40,914
Tranq gun with every rifle.

1215
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:44,920
That's as far back
as it goes, right?

1216
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,933
Hector, keep enough
tension to hold her up.

1217
01:02:54,933 --> 01:02:56,935
We don't know
how well she can swim.

1218
01:02:56,935 --> 01:03:00,940
Right.

1219
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:07,949
I hate to say it.

1220
01:03:07,949 --> 01:03:10,952
The more she thrashes,
the better.

1221
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:12,955
You ready
on shore?

1222
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,958
Yeah,
we're all right. We're ready.

1223
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,962
Ok.

1224
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:22,969
If she gets tired, pull her out.

1225
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,972
Jack:
What's she doing now?

1226
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:29,977
She's trying to fly.

1227
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:33,982
This is not a happy cow.

1228
01:03:34,983 --> 01:03:36,986
I'm rooting for the crocodile.

1229
01:03:36,986 --> 01:03:38,988
I hope he swallows
Your friends whole.

1230
01:03:38,988 --> 01:03:40,990
You might want to arrest
me for that, too.

1231
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,993
Is that a crime--

1232
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:45,997
To wish the chewing
of law enforcement?

1233
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:49,001
I'm not sure, ma'am.

1234
01:03:50,002 --> 01:03:52,006
You got'em?

1235
01:03:52,006 --> 01:03:53,007
Yeah, over here.

1236
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:55,009
Little battery!

1237
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:57,011
What's the deal?

1238
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:59,014
Well, we tried.

1239
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:02,018
Just a little longer, please.

1240
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:04,020
She doesn't seem to be swimming.

1241
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,022
No, she's floating.

1242
01:04:06,022 --> 01:04:08,025
She looks like a giant tea bag.

1243
01:04:09,026 --> 01:04:10,027
Ok, Hector.

1244
01:04:10,027 --> 01:04:13,031
Good plan, bad bait.
Game's up.

1245
01:04:13,031 --> 01:04:16,035
The cow disappoints me.

1246
01:04:17,037 --> 01:04:20,040
Hold on.

1247
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,041
I got something on the screen.

1248
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,045
What do you got?

1249
01:04:23,045 --> 01:04:24,046
He's coming.

1250
01:04:24,046 --> 01:04:26,048
Where?

1251
01:04:26,048 --> 01:04:27,049
How far out?

1252
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:29,051
30 meters or so.

1253
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:31,054
He's moving slow,
but he's definitely coming.

1254
01:04:31,054 --> 01:04:34,058
Can you confirm visually
or just radar?

1255
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:35,059
Radar.

1256
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:36,060
He's underwater,

1257
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,063
but he is coming!

1258
01:04:38,063 --> 01:04:40,065
All right, everybody
back in the trucks!

1259
01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:42,068
Move, move, move!

1260
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:43,069
Let's go, let's go!

1261
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:44,071
Let's go!

1262
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:45,073
Lead him in.

1263
01:04:45,073 --> 01:04:49,077
On our way.

1264
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:56,086
Remember to aim
for the stomach and the sides!

1265
01:04:56,086 --> 01:05:00,091
These darts
won't pierce his back!

1266
01:05:00,091 --> 01:05:03,095
He's surfacing.
There's his snout.

1267
01:05:03,095 --> 01:05:05,097
There he is!

1268
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:07,099
We've spotted him, Hector.

1269
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:10,103
You little snacker.

1270
01:05:10,103 --> 01:05:12,107
If he gets near her, pull up.

1271
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:14,109
She's worried about the cow now.

1272
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:18,114
Nice and slow, Hector.

1273
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:22,119
This net thing better work.

1274
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,121
He got you with it.

1275
01:05:25,123 --> 01:05:28,126
We're in about 4 feet
of water now.

1276
01:05:30,129 --> 01:05:31,131
She's mooing.

1277
01:05:31,131 --> 01:05:32,132
You wouldn't?

1278
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:33,133
You wouldn't?

1279
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:35,135
She's also kicking.

1280
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:38,139
A little closer, Hector.

1281
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:52,157
Oh, shit.

1282
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:57,163
Watch out!

1283
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:08,178
Motherfucker!

1284
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:11,182
Shit!

1285
01:06:11,182 --> 01:06:12,183
Where is he?

1286
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:16,188
We gotta getto him.

1287
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:19,191
Back us up.

1288
01:06:19,191 --> 01:06:21,194
Lose the tranq guns.
Go to the rifles.

1289
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:23,196
Getthe rifles!

1290
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,221
Where'd he go?

1291
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:43,222
Hold up.

1292
01:06:43,222 --> 01:06:45,224
Don't go back into the water.

1293
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:48,228
If you get a safe shot, take it.

1294
01:06:48,228 --> 01:06:52,233
Do not move, Hector!

1295
01:06:55,237 --> 01:06:57,239
Can you see anything
from out there?

1296
01:06:57,239 --> 01:06:59,241
Nothing!

1297
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:03,248
Maybe he swam back out!

1298
01:07:04,249 --> 01:07:06,251
Jesus!

1299
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:08,253
Hector!

1300
01:07:08,253 --> 01:07:09,255
Hey!

1301
01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:10,256
Get back in the truck!

1302
01:07:10,256 --> 01:07:14,261
I got him covered.

1303
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:20,268
Where is he?

1304
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:21,270
I don't know.

1305
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:25,275
He's gone under.

1306
01:07:32,285 --> 01:07:36,289
I just have this feeling
everything's totally safe.

1307
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:42,297
There!

1308
01:07:42,297 --> 01:07:43,298
He's swimming out!

1309
01:07:43,298 --> 01:07:44,299
I think I see him!

1310
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:48,304
I think I see his tail!

1311
01:08:01,321 --> 01:08:04,325
Shit! Kelly!

1312
01:08:04,325 --> 01:08:06,327
Aah!

1313
01:08:20,344 --> 01:08:24,350
Kelly!

1314
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:35,364
Kelly, swim, swim to me!

1315
01:08:35,364 --> 01:08:39,368
Swim to me, Kelly!

1316
01:08:41,372 --> 01:08:42,373
Shoot the fucking thing!

1317
01:08:42,373 --> 01:08:46,377
I don't have a clean shot.

1318
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:48,380
Dive under!

1319
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:52,386
Go under!

1320
01:08:53,387 --> 01:08:57,392
Fuck.

1321
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,417
"Let's save him."

1322
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:21,423
What a fucking great idea.

1323
01:09:46,454 --> 01:09:49,458
Come on.

1324
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:50,460
Here.

1325
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,463
Here we go.

1326
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:55,465
Where is he?

1327
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:56,466
I don't know.

1328
01:09:56,466 --> 01:09:58,469
We can't see him.

1329
01:09:58,469 --> 01:10:02,474
What-What?

1330
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:10,484
Hector!

1331
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:23,501
All right.

1332
01:10:23,501 --> 01:10:27,506
Game over.

1333
01:10:27,506 --> 01:10:28,507
Look.

1334
01:10:28,507 --> 01:10:31,511
He's suffering.

1335
01:10:31,511 --> 01:10:33,513
I get to be humane.

1336
01:10:33,513 --> 01:10:35,516
No, no!

1337
01:10:35,516 --> 01:10:37,518
No, no, no, look, he's trapped!

1338
01:10:37,518 --> 01:10:40,523
We've done it!

1339
01:10:40,523 --> 01:10:42,526
So what? It's not a net,
but he's trapped.

1340
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:44,528
Mission accomplished.

1341
01:10:44,528 --> 01:10:45,529
Shoot him.

1342
01:10:45,529 --> 01:10:46,530
I got more drugs.
He's half dead.

1343
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:50,536
He's half alive.
Shoot him!

1344
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,556
The drugs are kicking in.

1345
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,586
Look at him.

1346
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:32,588
He's done.

1347
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,590
Hank.

1348
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:36,594
All right, stand back.

1349
01:11:36,594 --> 01:11:38,596
No, no, no, Sheriff.

1350
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:39,597
Look.

1351
01:11:39,597 --> 01:11:41,600
Look, look.

1352
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,601
He's got nothing left.

1353
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:46,606
Go ahead.
Shoot him.

1354
01:11:52,614 --> 01:11:54,616
Really?

1355
01:11:54,616 --> 01:11:55,617
-Jack, we don't--
- Kelly.

1356
01:11:55,617 --> 01:11:57,619
We don't have to destroy him!

1357
01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:01,626
God damn it, look at him!

1358
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:05,630
Let me have that.

1359
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:06,632
Kelly:
He's been neutralized.

1360
01:12:06,632 --> 01:12:08,634
Come on, Jack,
he's trapped!

1361
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:09,635
Look at him!
He can't move!

1362
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:10,637
What's the point?

1363
01:12:10,637 --> 01:12:11,638
We don't have to do this.

1364
01:12:11,638 --> 01:12:15,643
Jack, you don't have to.
Please!

1365
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:31,664
Oh, God!

1366
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:33,666
He's got me!

1367
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:34,667
Jesus!

1368
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:35,668
Jesus Christ!

1369
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:38,672
Are there 2?
I think there's 2.

1370
01:12:38,672 --> 01:12:40,675
I can see that.

1371
01:12:40,675 --> 01:12:41,676
He bit me!

1372
01:12:41,676 --> 01:12:43,678
He bit me!
There's 2,there's 2!

1373
01:12:43,678 --> 01:12:47,683
I can count.

1374
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:51,689
No!

1375
01:12:55,694 --> 01:12:59,699
Back to one.

1376
01:13:00,701 --> 01:13:02,703
Go ahead.

1377
01:13:02,703 --> 01:13:06,707
Flax him.

1378
01:13:13,716 --> 01:13:15,719
Oh, here they are.

1379
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,723
Just in time.
Nice to see you.

1380
01:13:26,733 --> 01:13:28,735
We're gonna need
to get this reptile

1381
01:13:28,735 --> 01:13:30,739
some medical attention.

1382
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,741
We, uh...

1383
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:36,746
trapped him with our chopper.

1384
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:52,768
Portland?

1385
01:13:52,768 --> 01:13:53,769
Yes, Portland.

1386
01:13:53,769 --> 01:13:55,771
They'll tank him there
until we figure out

1387
01:13:55,771 --> 01:13:57,773
something better to do.

1388
01:13:57,773 --> 01:13:59,775
So, Sheriff, Sheriff,

1389
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:01,779
you got to fire
your big gun finally.

1390
01:14:01,779 --> 01:14:02,780
Was it fun?

1391
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,783
Overrated.

1392
01:14:05,783 --> 01:14:06,784
What'd Bickerman say?

1393
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:08,787
Well, she didn't want to tell us

1394
01:14:08,787 --> 01:14:10,790
about the second croc,

1395
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,792
'cause she was afraid
we'd blow its head off.

1396
01:14:12,792 --> 01:14:16,797
Women's intuition.

1397
01:14:16,797 --> 01:14:17,799
We got room for one more.

1398
01:14:17,799 --> 01:14:19,801
Someone should
probably go with him.

1399
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:20,803
Uh...

1400
01:14:20,803 --> 01:14:23,807
I'm still packing up some stuff,

1401
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:26,810
but, uh...

1402
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,812
I'll go.

1403
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:30,816
So, I imagine you're gonna have

1404
01:14:30,816 --> 01:14:33,819
a few reports to do.

1405
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:35,821
If you need anything, let me know.

1406
01:14:35,821 --> 01:14:39,826
Yeah. It was nice meeting you.

1407
01:14:39,826 --> 01:14:43,831
Gee, Hank,
don't get all choked up.

1408
01:14:43,831 --> 01:14:45,835
With you, I'm still mixed.

1409
01:14:45,835 --> 01:14:49,839
Oh, well, then, just to
offend you on principle, then.

1410
01:14:51,842 --> 01:14:55,847
See you.

1411
01:15:02,856 --> 01:15:03,857
Well...

1412
01:15:03,857 --> 01:15:05,859
You want a ride in my truck?

1413
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:06,860
Oh, we just finished

1414
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,863
loading up the front oft he truck.

1415
01:15:08,863 --> 01:15:09,865
Do you want us to
take some stuff out?

1416
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:11,867
No, no, that's all right.

1417
01:15:11,867 --> 01:15:12,869
I'm gonna be
a little while anyway.

1418
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:14,871
I want to go say
good-bye to the lake.

1419
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:17,875
You sure, because
I don't mind--

1420
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,879
No. I actually want
to stay a little longer.

1421
01:15:20,879 --> 01:15:21,880
All right.

1422
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,885
All right.

1423
01:15:26,886 --> 01:15:28,888
If I'm ever in New York, I'll...

1424
01:15:28,888 --> 01:15:32,894
Yeah.

1425
01:15:34,896 --> 01:15:38,900
Yeah.

1426
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,925
So, does nobody ever
make a move in Maine?

1427
01:16:00,929 --> 01:16:02,932
That's it?
You slide your duffel bag?

1428
01:16:02,932 --> 01:16:04,934
Just...

1429
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:05,935
get in the truck.

1430
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:07,938
Go for a beer.

1431
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,942
There's a good bar in town.

1432
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:11,944
Bet that's charming.

1433
01:16:11,944 --> 01:16:12,945
Are the glasses clean?

1434
01:16:12,945 --> 01:16:14,947
Mostly.

1435
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:17,951
You gonna complain
the whole time?

1436
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:18,952
Jack.

1437
01:16:18,952 --> 01:16:22,957
Start the truck.

1438
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:30,967
I already miss the crocodile.

1439
01:17:15,023 --> 01:17:18,026
Cute little buttons.
Oh, ho ho.

1440
01:17:18,026 --> 01:17:21,031
Oh, mama loves you.

1441
01:17:21,031 --> 01:17:22,032
Come on.

1442
01:17:22,032 --> 01:17:24,034
Eat your supper.

1443
01:17:24,034 --> 01:17:26,037
Nibble mommy's toes.

1444
01:17:26,037 --> 01:17:27,038
Yes.
