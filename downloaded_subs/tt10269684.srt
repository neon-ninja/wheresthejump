Hi, you've reached
Tom Dennistoun

3
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,753
of Dennistoun's Design.

4
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,689
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.

5
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,491
If it's urgent,
give Pete a call. Thanks.

6
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,163
You can't control it.

7
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,532
You don't have anything to say.

8
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:15,467
Your biggest mistake
is believing you can.

9
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,868
You don't know anything.

10
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,314
It's kind of a weird gift,

11
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:31,683
but I'm sure he'll love it.

12
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,295
Hi, Russ.

13
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,764
Morning, Betty!

14
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,277
He's probably out
walking Friendo.

15
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,248
- You think?
- He never leaves the house,

16
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,483
but I don't know.

17
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,985
He put a new doorknob on.

18
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,819
Check that out.

19
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:10,223
- That's a start.
- Mm.

20
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,329
We gotta go grab the daisies.

21
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:18,897
Lilies.

22
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,437
At least the car
will smell nice.

23
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,407
Hey, Charlie!

24
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,408
Charlie.

25
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:33,512
I guess we'll just see you
at the cemetery.

26
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:35,247
Okay, man.

27
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,081
Hey, Russ.

28
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,784
You mind keeping an eye
on that thing?

29
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,253
Thanks, bud.

30
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,879
The curb's a little weird.

31
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,382
Give me your hand.

32
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:10,915
Okay.

33
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,419
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

34
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,488
You're coming to the restaurant
after this, right?

35
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,524
No.

36
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,326
I made reservations
for all of us,

37
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,329
- plus Gale.
- Where are we going?

38
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:24,963
Um, Gale's not coming.

39
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,932
She told me she was.

40
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,536
She was just trying
to be polite.

41
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,305
It's a hard day.

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,908
Did you pick the chairs?

43
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,811
Yeah. I think we're gonna...

44
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:41,646
I think we're gonna go
with brown.

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,550
- How's that sound?
- Mm.

46
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,553
I don't know, I'm not making
the decision for you.

47
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,588
The wrong chairs'll throw
the whole day off.

48
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,358
We don't want that!

49
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,929
Hi, you've reached
Tom Dennistoun

50
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,764
of Dennistoun's Design.

51
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,634
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.

52
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,870
If it's urgent,
give Pete a call. Thanks.

53
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:19,778
You know, you could've
picked him up.

54
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:25,117
We knocked.

55
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:29,087
I'll be in the car.

56
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,203
What'll it be?

57
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,937
Ooh, I'm just browsing,

58
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:49,141
but, uh, Betty,
you want something?

59
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,810
I'm driving.

60
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,579
I'll drive. What do you want?

61
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,514
It's okay.
I don't want anything.

62
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,616
She'll have a tequila soda.

63
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:00,052
And I will have a double soda.

64
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:03,756
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, buddy.

65
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,959
Don't know what your dad loved
so much about this place.

66
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,661
The free popcorn.

67
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:11,863
- Free popcorn?
- Mhm.

68
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:14,599
- Carl?
- Yeah?

69
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,234
You guys got free popcorn?

70
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,470
Aw, man, that machine's busted.

71
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,838
Shocker.

72
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:27,178
You think Carl made this?

73
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:30,048
Fuck, I forgot
to leave this for him.

74
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,916
Don't worry about it,
I'll bring it over.

75
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,618
I'm sure he'll be psyched
to see me.

76
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,021
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

77
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,689
It doesn't matter,
he's not gonna show anyway.

78
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,693
He's gonna come,
he's gonna come.

79
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,627
Grief is...

80
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,896
grief is tough,
it takes time.

81
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,031
How much time does he need?

82
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:49,802
He's in that house all day.

83
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,204
That's why I'm trying
to get him out.

84
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,706
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

85
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,676
I got some guys.

86
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:58,877
Hey, kids.

87
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,146
Oh. Hi.

88
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,247
Hi, Carl.

89
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,115
In honor of your dad.

90
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:07,086
Thanks, Carl.

91
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,587
A year gone...

92
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:12,925
...is a year too long.

93
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,793
Thank you.

94
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,829
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

95
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:20,132
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I...

96
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,902
To us.

97
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,237
To us. Mhm.

98
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,077
Fires.

99
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,649
Then mudslides?

100
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:41,720
Bet they didn't plan
on that one.

101
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,089
Oh, what the heck.

102
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,125
Can't control any of it.

103
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,802
You don't have anything to say.

104
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,170
I was buying time.

105
00:08:58,202 --> 00:08:59,637
You shouldn't get close
to people.

106
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,140
Trying to find a solution.

107
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:32,030
Your brother won't answer,
you won't answer.

108
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,131
Make sure he's almost done

109
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,099
with your father's
house repairs.

110
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,668
Oh, and I hired a DJ.

111
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:37,970
You'll love her.

112
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:53,451
Hey, Charlie.

113
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,053
Charlie!

114
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,155
Charlie.

115
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,057
It's Benny, open up.

116
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,960
Hey.

117
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,294
Dammit.

118
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,432
What an idiot.

119
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,140
Hey, Charlie, I'm coming in.

120
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,945
Hey, man.

121
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,052
Friendo!

122
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,389
Hey, buddy.

123
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,125
Just me.

124
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,167
What a slob.

125
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,402
Jesus.

126
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:46,938
Oh.

127
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,075
Ooh.

128
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,188
Hey.

129
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,129
Happy birthday.

130
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,131
Brought you a new roommate.

131
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:48,466
Don't even need to water it,
it's fake.

132
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,338
What's going on?

133
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,475
Working.

134
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,844
We missed you today!

135
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,913
Your sister was pretty bummed.

136
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,948
Your mom... well, she's your mom.

137
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,487
Okay.

138
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,089
Forgot to leave the RSVP.

139
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,192
Um...

140
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:15,293
Feel free to fill it out.

141
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,129
Tough choices.

142
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,398
Lemon chicken or mahi-mahi.

143
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,874
Where's Friendo?
I didn't see him when I came in.

144
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,312
He's in the backyard.

145
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,917
Okay.

146
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,420
The house is looking good.

147
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,322
Devil's in the details,
they say.

148
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:46,859
Rehearsal dinner is
in a couple days.

149
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,294
You don't have to wear the suit
we brought you.

150
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:51,897
Just wear something clean.

151
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:55,366
It'll mean a lot
to your sister if you came.

152
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,169
We only want her
getting married once, right?

153
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,475
And when you get a chance,
give her a call.

154
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,377
I know she'd love
to hear from you.

155
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,114
Okay.

156
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:11,049
Your coffee is shit, by the way.

157
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,187
I'll show myself out.

158
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:30,201
But, uh, I'm on my way.

159
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:33,171
Got a little sidetracked,
but my head's all clear.

160
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:35,573
I will see you soon.

161
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,009
Order me some egg rolls

162
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,277
and, uh, maybe
some crab rangoon.

163
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,410
Okay, I love you, babe.

164
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,945
Bye.

165
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,447
Charlie?

166
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,289
Have you seen my harmonica?

167
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,393
Should be around here somewhere.

168
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:42,827
Mhm.

169
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,698
Man, you were conked out
on the couch last night.

170
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:50,367
Could not wake you up.

171
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:51,803
Yeah.

172
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:54,705
You know, my dad used to sleep
on the couch all the time.

173
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,575
He'd be up until
like 1 or 2 A.M.

174
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,644
and wake up a few hours later
and go to work.

175
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,182
Sounds like a dad.

176
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:15,894
Okay, what's going on?

177
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:17,561
I've been thinking
about the car,

178
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:18,730
about selling it.

179
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,732
We just got the car.

180
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,768
Why do we want to sell it?

181
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,403
Dad's car.

182
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,737
Oh.

183
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,173
I mean, it's just
gonna sit there.

184
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:31,643
Yeah.

185
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:33,744
Yeah.

186
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:36,847
You probably gotta...

187
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,717
you gotta talk to Charlie
about that first.

188
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,286
Why we even brought it back,
I have no idea.

189
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:43,521
I'm not arguing with you.

190
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:47,525
How much do you think
it's worth?

191
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:48,860
That car?

192
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:52,396
It's been in the sun
for a year.

193
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,207
You really should talk
to your brother about this

194
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,141
if you really want
to sell the car.

195
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:05,877
- It's not his decision.
- It's not yours.

196
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:11,616
Come on.

197
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,229
Where'd you hide it?

198
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:26,531
Hamper.

199
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:29,868
You know what this means?

200
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:30,869
Don't!

201
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,271
I'm not... I'm not in the mood.

202
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:35,440
Okay, all right.

203
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:36,575
I gotta go.

204
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,481
Give me a hug.

205
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,817
Come on, I gotta go.

206
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,622
It's gonna be all right.

207
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:51,956
- All right?
- Yeah.

208
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,526
It's gonna be good.

209
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:55,993
I love you.

210
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,495
There's some leftovers
in the fridge

211
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,530
- if you get hungry later.
- Thank you.

212
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,383
Hi, you've reached
Tom Dennistoun

213
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,417
of Dennistoun's Design.

214
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:56,320
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.

215
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:59,057
If it's urgent,
give Pete a call. Thanks.

216
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,333
Don't you ever check your mail?

217
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,605
I've been trying you
for a fucking year.

218
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:20,577
Don't be a fool
like your father.

219
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:24,983
245-6123.

220
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:27,885
I won't be calling you again.

221
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,688
This is your Uncle Pete.

222
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:30,915
Ow!

223
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,560
Charlie?

224
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:46,698
Are you good?

225
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:50,402
Yeah, I'm fucking great, Russ!

226
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:56,607
Come on over here then.

227
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,777
I'll fix us an early supper.

228
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:13,057
Don't be a hoarder,

229
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,493
like the ones on TV.

230
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:20,664
If you're gonna stay
in that house,

231
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:24,134
get rid of whatever

232
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:26,404
don't make you happy.

233
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:29,774
Most of it's
at my mom's house,

234
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,443
and I'm not planning
on staying there.

235
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,212
Most of it?

236
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,881
All of it!

237
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,750
Don't leave nothing!

238
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,453
I'm working on it.

239
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:47,592
My dad left a lot to do.

240
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,499
You done?

241
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,870
I'll do the dishes.

242
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:02,740
Yes, you will!

243
00:24:02,772 --> 00:24:05,076
I did the cooking.

244
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:08,645
Well, pretty fair trade,
I guess.

245
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,761
Charlie?

246
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:36,607
See you tomorrow, Russ!

247
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:29,988
You finally got back to me, huh?

248
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:36,994
Listen to me, Charlie.

249
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,365
This thing is going
to destroy you,

250
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:42,833
just like it did your father.

251
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,740
Leave, before you hurt
anyone else.

252
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:53,745
You have the address.

253
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:17,994
Hey.

254
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,264
Seatbelt, please.

255
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:23,100
32 Hockomock?

256
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,971
Gonna be a long one.

257
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:53,498
I was almost dead.

258
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,750
A haunted house party.

259
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:30,300
Friendo?

260
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:31,335
Friendo!

261
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,137
Hey, buddy!

262
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,072
How are you?

263
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:36,141
Oh, my...

264
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:48,152
Hi, you've reached
Tom Dennistoun

265
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:50,020
of Dennistoun's Design.

266
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,857
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.

267
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,594
If it's urgent,
give Pete a call. Thanks.

268
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:52,076
Get in here.

269
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:55,379
Get in here.

270
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:08,024
I was wondering
when you'd get here.

271
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,000
Want a drink?

272
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:29,146
Sit down.

273
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:35,987
Sit down.

274
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:32,009
God damn, if you don't look
just like him.

275
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,655
Aren't you supposed to be dead?

276
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,623
God damn thing.

277
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,373
You hungry?

278
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:40,670
Ah!

279
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:41,872
Ahhh!

280
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:43,274
Ah!

281
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,542
Where did that happen?

282
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,744
Huh?

283
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:49,879
Where did that happen?

284
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:56,186
At Dad's house.

285
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:57,754
Your Dad's house?

286
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:02,358
That happen before?

287
00:36:05,394 --> 00:36:07,898
Answer me!
Did that happen before?

288
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:09,266
No.

289
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:20,543
You weren't followed here,
were you?

290
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,648
Were you followed here?

291
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,326
No.

292
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:58,983
You hear that?

293
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,356
What was that?

294
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:54,472
Let's go.

295
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:11,722
What is this?

296
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:17,560
These are my brothers.

297
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:20,630
They listened to me.

298
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,099
Your father would
have been here, too,

299
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,768
if he didn't kill himself.

300
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,362
Let's go.

301
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,099
Let's go!

302
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:00,503
Let's go!

303
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,510
You need to stay here.

304
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,878
You know that.

305
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:51,889
Did you hear me?

306
00:39:57,893 --> 00:39:58,862
Can't.

307
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:17,181
This is our family.

308
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:23,721
Who we are.

309
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,860
Don't do what my brother did.

310
00:40:37,032 --> 00:40:39,469
I'm going to bed.

311
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,737
32 Hockomock.

312
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:15,204
How do you even know it's real?

313
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:18,641
So Charlie knows
I'm coming over?

314
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:25,581
He knows I'm coming over?

315
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:26,483
Hey.

316
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,821
Yeah, just get the key from him.

317
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:35,224
I think this is cool,
I'm glad you talked to him.

318
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:37,260
Makes me happy.

319
00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:39,896
Soon, you'll be happy.

320
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:42,031
We will all be happy.

321
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:44,001
I love you.

322
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,568
Bye.

323
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,234
Hey, Charlie!

324
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:54,271
Hey!

325
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:56,840
Good morning.

326
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:58,708
Hey.

327
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,349
Whoa, ahh!

328
00:43:06,382 --> 00:43:08,985
Oh, God, ahh!

329
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:12,923
What happened to your arm?

330
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:14,724
Something scratched me.

331
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:32,174
What the hell happened, man?

332
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,211
What happened to Friendo?

333
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:40,351
I didn't think you
actually meant in the backyard.

334
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:44,353
You know,
you can come stay with us.

335
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:46,023
I think it'd be good for you.

336
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,425
Get away from this house.

337
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,693
I got some guys,
they could finish it up.

338
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:53,396
I think you just need
to get away for a while,

339
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:56,165
clear your head.

340
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,967
Oh, hold on.

341
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,369
Oh.

342
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:02,673
Hey, hey, what's up, Paco?

343
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,709
Yeah, we're here with the car.

344
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:07,744
Yeah.

345
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:09,413
Five minutes, five minutes.

346
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:10,980
Cool.

347
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:12,716
All right, yeah.

348
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:15,151
See ya soon.

349
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:16,953
Paco's on his way, man.

350
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:21,791
What car?

351
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:24,727
The car,
Paco's gonna pick it up.

352
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,329
Who's that, what car?

353
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:32,268
Oh, fuck.

354
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,005
Betty's selling the car.

355
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,840
It's good, it's good.

356
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,708
That car is bad mojo.

357
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,445
Change is good.

358
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,313
If my mentor,

359
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,316
Humberto,

360
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:47,984
didn't have to change
the way he ate his food,

361
00:44:48,016 --> 00:44:49,885
he would've never met
the nurse in the cafeteria

362
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:51,487
at the hospital.

363
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,090
If the bobcat never came along...

364
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:02,331
All I'm saying is
life is weird, man.

365
00:45:02,364 --> 00:45:04,233
You never know
what's around the corner.

366
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:10,840
I'm gonna take care
of that wasp nest before...

367
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,251
This isn't the most humane,
but it's the coolest.

368
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:40,336
Oh, ah!

369
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,809
- Sorry I scared you.
- Oh, hi.

370
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:49,545
- You're Paco.
- Yeah, I'm here for Ben.

371
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,914
Yeah, I'm Betty... oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:58,455
I'm actually... I'm not gonna
sell the car today,

373
00:45:58,487 --> 00:46:00,190
and I know you came
all the way out.

374
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:01,791
All right, so are you gonna
sell it another day,

375
00:46:01,824 --> 00:46:04,160
- just not today?
- I can't sell it right now.

376
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:08,798
Thanks, thanks a lot.

377
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:10,199
Fuck!

378
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:48,338
Oh, great, you made up
your mind about the chairs.

379
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:52,208
Do you still have Dad's stuff?

380
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,611
Yeah, in the garage.

381
00:46:54,643 --> 00:46:56,979
I think beige will look better,
what do you think?

382
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:03,052
Uh, sure.

383
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:04,921
Your voice is so shaky.

384
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:12,629
This is all just
so overwhelming.

385
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,397
What, the chairs?

386
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:21,070
No, not the chairs.

387
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:23,105
I'm gonna tell them beige.

388
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,909
Great.

389
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:28,245
Okay.

390
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:30,646
Yeah, we're gonna
stick with the beige.

391
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:33,115
All set, honey, um, talk soon.

392
00:47:33,148 --> 00:47:34,951
Bye, Mom.

393
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:16,278
What were you building
back there?

394
00:50:16,311 --> 00:50:17,813
Ah, I don't know.

395
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:26,322
There are some things
we should do,

396
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:29,025
and some things you want to do.

397
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:36,132
But, we shouldn't

398
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:39,134
do it all by ourselves.

399
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:41,570
Russ, I think I'm seeing things
that aren't real, man.

400
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:46,777
Who says it isn't real?

401
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:01,557
Thanks for letting me
borrow that by the way.

402
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:05,594
Any time.

403
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,708
Charlie.

404
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:32,702
What did you think would happen?

405
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,972
What's wrong with you?

406
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:39,442
Everyone's sad.

407
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:44,347
Why can't you just get over it?

408
00:54:47,682 --> 00:54:50,353
Hey, good morning, buddy,
I was in the neighborhood,

409
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:51,721
I was gonna bring you
some coffee.

410
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:53,922
Sorry about yesterday.

411
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:56,425
What's going on?

412
00:54:59,594 --> 00:55:01,963
I gotta go.

413
00:55:01,996 --> 00:55:04,733
You know,
the rehearsal's in two days.

414
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:08,737
Look, you were right,
the house is way too much work.

415
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:11,074
Get your guys to fix it up.

416
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:13,076
I gotta get out of town.

417
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:20,849
You're telling that to Betty.

418
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:25,454
Okay, fine, let's go,
I'll follow you.

419
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:26,722
- Let's go.
- No, no, we're gonna

420
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:29,391
go over there right now.

421
00:55:29,425 --> 00:55:31,627
- Ugh.
- Please get out.

422
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:34,431
Once you talk
to your sister, I'm out.

423
00:56:52,106 --> 00:56:54,411
We taking the long way, buddy?

424
00:57:01,182 --> 00:57:02,684
Do you know where you're going,
or we just kinda

425
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,453
- playing this one by ear?
- You know,

426
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,056
I can drop you off wherever.

427
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:08,757
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm good, I'm good,

428
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,160
I'm just, like,
backseat driving, I know.

429
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:13,463
Just go, we're good.

430
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,068
Let me just, I'm gonna give...
I'm gonna give, uh,

431
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:21,770
the old battle axe a call.

432
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:23,606
Let... let Betty know what's up.

433
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,579
Uh, alrighty.

434
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:33,215
Betty, Betty,
Betty, Betty, Betty.

435
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:35,717
Ah, this is cool out here.

436
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,920
Hi, it's Betty,
sorry I missed your call.

437
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:39,822
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

438
00:57:39,855 --> 00:57:41,791
Thanks, bye

439
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:44,793
Hey, babe,
just calling, checking in.

440
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:47,263
Um, sorry for being
a butthead last night

441
00:57:47,295 --> 00:57:49,998
with the garden hose thing.

442
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:52,735
Um, hope you got some rest
at your mom's.

443
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:58,039
And she didn't melt your brain.

444
00:57:58,072 --> 00:58:00,509
Um, I'm actually hanging out
with Charlie today.

445
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,111
Going for a little drive.

446
00:58:02,143 --> 00:58:03,712
But, I just wanted to check in

447
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,615
and tell you that I miss you,

448
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:08,518
and I love you,

449
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,753
and, uh, give me a call

450
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,155
when your phone's not dead,

451
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:17,660
or turned off, or you're done
being angry with me.

452
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:19,829
Again, I'm sorry,
talk to you later, babe.

453
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:14,918
Fuck, where are we?

454
00:59:29,063 --> 00:59:31,333
I can really take a piss break

455
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,269
in a little bit.

456
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:35,104
Drank all that coffee.

457
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:45,380
You want me to drive?
I can drive.

458
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:48,585
I know it's your dad's car,
but I can drive.

459
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,622
Just let me know, you know?

460
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:39,201
- It's too late for all of us.
- You may start to hear

461
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:41,269
- this voice in your head.
- You feel like a stranger

462
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:42,904
- in your own body.
- Hockomock is just

463
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:44,874
- a place to rot.
- You can't kill it.

464
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,175
- Going there won't solve this.
- You can't hide from it.

465
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:49,244
- Charlie?
- You'll suffer forever.

466
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:52,080
- Finish what you started.
- It'll find a way to hurt you.

467
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:54,050
- It always finds a way.
- This way,

468
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,985
- you two can put an end to it.
- You can't control it.

469
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:58,286
Stay away from Hockomock,
stay away.

470
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,157
- It will become you.
- It will kill the ones you love.

471
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,206
Is this where
you keep the snacks?

472
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:23,411
Pull over.

473
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:25,780
Pull over.

474
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:27,115
Stop the car!

475
01:01:27,148 --> 01:01:28,817
Stop the car, man.

476
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:31,420
What are you doing?

477
01:01:31,452 --> 01:01:33,054
Get out of the car.

478
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:34,390
Get out of the car,
turn the car off,

479
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:36,191
get out of the car.

480
01:01:38,025 --> 01:01:40,429
I wish I didn't know
you had a gun in there, man.

481
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:03,118
Hi, guys,
what can I get for you?

482
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:06,788
Coffee and water, please.

483
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:08,524
Coffee and water, you got it.

484
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:11,326
- For you?
- Cheeseburger, fries.

485
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,329
Okay, medium, medium-rare?

486
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,364
- Medium.
- Great, anything to drink?

487
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:19,268
- Definitely a beer.
- Okay.

488
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,971
- Light beer.
- You got it.

489
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:24,239
- No food for you?
- No, thank you.

490
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:27,041
Okay, the burger
should be a moment,

491
01:02:27,074 --> 01:02:29,811
and I'll get
your drinks right away.

492
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:37,886
You gotta eat something.

493
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:46,561
Look, I'm sorry
I lost your headphones.

494
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,534
Stupid.

495
01:02:54,503 --> 01:02:56,472
I shouldn't have
taken them out of the car.

496
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,014
All right, coffee for you.

497
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,882
Beer, water.

498
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,052
- May I have some milk?
- Yeah, sure thing.

499
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,405
How much further

500
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,840
do you wanna take this, man?

501
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:39,047
Me and your sister
care about you.

502
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:51,227
Look.

503
01:03:54,262 --> 01:03:57,532
Grief is a motherfucker.

504
01:03:57,565 --> 01:03:59,934
You know that.

505
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:08,109
Before I met your sister,

506
01:04:08,143 --> 01:04:10,346
I was pretty messed up.

507
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:14,884
It felt like

508
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:18,152
there was this sadness

509
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:20,021
inside of me,

510
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:22,991
and I couldn't shake it.

511
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,626
But, I did.

512
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,103
All I'm saying is

513
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,405
you don't have to do it alone.

514
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:41,510
You just have to do something.

515
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:57,226
I do have to do something.

516
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:06,634
You know that wasp nest
at the house?

517
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:10,271
I know that you know it.

518
01:05:14,608 --> 01:05:16,244
Well, I've gotten rid
of that thing about

519
01:05:16,277 --> 01:05:19,948
half a dozen times now.

520
01:05:19,981 --> 01:05:22,684
Just keeps coming back.

521
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:24,385
They keep coming back.

522
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,591
It wasn't a big deal at first.

523
01:05:29,623 --> 01:05:31,125
Just wasps.

524
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:37,333
But, then it was other things,
like window screens.

525
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:41,369
The doorknob.

526
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:45,606
Stupid doorknob.

527
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:55,617
I don't think it wanted me
to leave the house.

528
01:06:00,554 --> 01:06:03,157
I think it got my dad, too.

529
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:10,264
I know it killed Friendo.

530
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:11,566
It killed Russ.

531
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:17,339
It's gonna kill me.

532
01:06:17,371 --> 01:06:19,607
Kill Mom, kill Betty.

533
01:06:23,644 --> 01:06:25,380
Until I do something.

534
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:30,786
Okay, cheeseburger with fries.

535
01:06:30,818 --> 01:06:32,788
Excuse me.

536
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,324
Now.

537
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:37,092
Enjoy.

538
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:44,500
I need to wash my hands.

539
01:06:44,532 --> 01:06:46,668
That looks pretty good.

540
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:50,438
- Where's your restroom?
- Oh, it's right around

541
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:53,542
- the corner to the left.
- Thank you.

542
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:56,310
Hey, here's your milk,
sorry about that.

543
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,547
Burger tasting okay?

544
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:02,418
Hm, can I get some ketchup?

545
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,452
- Okay, we have mustard, too.
- Yeah, that's great.

546
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:06,521
- Dijon?
- Yeah, that's great.

547
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:09,057
Okay, get you
another beer as well?

548
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,291
Yeah, thank you.

549
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:17,099
Yeah, I'll have another.

550
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:58,666
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

551
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,903
Thanks, bye.

552
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:03,704
Hey, uh, I've been trying
to get a hold of you all day.

553
01:09:03,738 --> 01:09:06,775
It's been a...
it's been a weird one.

554
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:08,476
Uh, oh, this is Ben.

555
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:10,212
My phone died.

556
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:13,814
Um, I don't know what's
going on with your brother.

557
01:09:13,847 --> 01:09:16,784
Uh, he doesn't...
he doesn't seem well.

558
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:19,621
I'm... I'm worried.

559
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:23,392
But, um... but, don't worry.

560
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,793
I got this,
I'll take care of him.

561
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:27,796
So, I'm just calling
to tell you I love you,

562
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:29,530
and I'll try again later.

563
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,569
Finish what you started.

564
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:37,838
Disappear.

565
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,911
Hey, is everything okay?

566
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:44,813
Yeah, I don't know.

567
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:49,585
Okay, um, we're closing.

568
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,253
Sorry, uh,
can I get you anything?

569
01:09:51,286 --> 01:09:53,355
Maybe another beer, or coffee?

570
01:09:53,387 --> 01:09:56,658
- Yeah, coffee would be good.
- Okay, I'll get it for you.

571
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,527
- Hey.
- Hm?

572
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:03,832
Do you know anyone
who lives around here?

573
01:10:03,864 --> 01:10:06,300
Well, yeah.

574
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,237
Um, Hockomock?

575
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,473
Hockomock Lane,
do you know where that is?

576
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:12,908
Hey, Rocco.

577
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,710
Do you know where
Hockomock Lane is?

578
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,914
I'm clocked out.

579
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:23,452
I'm sorry.

580
01:10:23,484 --> 01:10:26,020
What time do you get off?

581
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:28,690
- I'm not...
- Could you give me a ride?

582
01:10:30,358 --> 01:10:32,293
- Um.
- Hey, hey.

583
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:36,265
I'm a park ranger,
I rescue cubs from trees.

584
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:37,733
My boyfriends gonna be here
in about 30 minutes.

585
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,800
Do you have...
do you have time to wait?

586
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,636
Yeah, that's fine, that's great.

587
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,404
Okay.

588
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:45,574
Can I get you some milk?

589
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:47,743
- Sure.
- Okay.

590
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:48,909
I'll get your coffee.

591
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:08,596
Pete thought he could trick it.

592
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,864
Fake his death.

593
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,733
Outrun it.

594
01:11:11,765 --> 01:11:14,635
No fucking way.

595
01:11:14,668 --> 01:11:16,037
It found him,

596
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,774
like it found me.

597
01:11:18,806 --> 01:11:21,542
It'll find a way to hurt you,

598
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:24,512
and hurt the ones you love.

599
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:37,092
Let's go.

600
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:47,903
You don't know
what you're doing.

601
01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:49,837
Shut up.

602
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:03,117
Is he normally this late?

603
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,519
About 15 minutes.

604
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:16,664
Is that a fucking
cop costume, my dude?

605
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:19,000
Nick, shut up,
I told you he needs a ride.

606
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:21,470
Hi, I'm Benjamin.

607
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:24,739
No smoking in the car, my dude.

608
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,475
It's gotta go out.

609
01:12:26,507 --> 01:12:29,010
Nick, let's go.

610
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:31,679
- It's going out, let's go.
- Sorry, can we go?

611
01:12:31,712 --> 01:12:34,750
Yeah, we're trying to.

612
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:35,984
Thanks.

613
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,389
Do you know how much...
do you know how much

614
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:42,056
further we have to go?

615
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:47,862
Do you know how much...?

616
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:50,097
Could I charge my phone,
do you have a charger up there?

617
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:51,833
No, I'm sorry.

618
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:53,835
The music's so loud, I can't...

619
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,507
I'm sorry, I gotta...
I just can't hear.

620
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,042
Don't, dude,
are you fucking serious?

621
01:13:01,074 --> 01:13:03,412
- Hey, hey, it's fine...
- I'm just gonna turn it down...

622
01:13:03,444 --> 01:13:04,945
Are you fucking serious, dude?

623
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:07,749
What the fuck, guys,
what the heck, guys!

624
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:10,418
- Calm down, calm down.
- Come on, come on, take it easy!

625
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,954
- So unacceptable.
- Take it easy!

626
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:15,489
- Come on, what are you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

627
01:13:15,523 --> 01:13:18,827
Stop it, Nick, stop it!

628
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:21,529
- What are you doing to him?
- What the fuck?

629
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,565
- He didn't even do anything.
- Unacceptable.

630
01:13:24,599 --> 01:13:25,900
- Are you serious?
- What, no!

631
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,601
- Are you serious?
- He just needed a ride!

632
01:13:27,635 --> 01:13:29,738
Absolutely unacceptable.

633
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:34,141
My hat!

634
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:35,811
That's a federal offense!

635
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:40,949
Ah, fuck.

636
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:48,222
What are we doing here?

637
01:13:48,256 --> 01:13:50,759
I need you to dig.

638
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:52,594
What?

639
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:54,529
Dig.

640
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:58,867
- You don't know what you're do...
- Shut the fuck up

641
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:00,734
and dig.

642
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:09,243
Come on.

643
01:14:18,051 --> 01:14:20,221
Charlie!

644
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,556
Charlie.

645
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:24,192
Charlie!

646
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:44,211
Charlie!

647
01:14:55,622 --> 01:14:57,125
Charlie!

648
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:05,966
Charlie!

649
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:18,112
Charlie!

650
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,586
Charlie!

651
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:27,154
Where is he?

652
01:15:31,192 --> 01:15:32,994
Charlie!

653
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:40,168
Charlie, Charlie, buddy.

654
01:15:40,201 --> 01:15:42,237
Come on.

655
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,939
Hey, just look at me.

656
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:45,773
Just look at me, come on.

657
01:15:45,806 --> 01:15:47,675
I'm gonna get you out of here,
all right?

658
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:48,909
I'm gonna get you out of here.

659
01:15:59,186 --> 01:16:01,823
You don't have
anything to say, Charlie?

660
01:16:01,855 --> 01:16:03,791
You shouldn't
get close to people.

661
01:16:03,824 --> 01:16:06,260
There's nothing you can say,
or do anything.

662
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:08,095
- Charlie?
- You don't understand

663
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:10,966
your family.

664
01:16:10,998 --> 01:16:13,635
You saw your dad every day.

665
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,135
But, who the hell was he?

666
01:16:19,273 --> 01:16:22,043
- You don't have anything to say.
- Talk to each other.

667
01:16:31,284 --> 01:16:32,953
Charlie!

668
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:37,157
Ahh, stop, stop!

669
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,730
Stop!

670
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:52,807
I can't... I can't
do this anymore, man.

671
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:08,190
Let's just go home.

672
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,942
Charlie!

673
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:31,279
Close the casket!

674
01:17:38,418 --> 01:17:39,921
Close it!

675
01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:44,391
Close it, god damnit, close it!

676
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:46,161
Close it!

677
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:57,251
We're gonna have a kid.
