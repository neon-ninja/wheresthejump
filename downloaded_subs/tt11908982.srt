00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:54,481
Husbands, love your wife,

3
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,518
as Christ loved the church,

4
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:01,656
that he might sanctify her.

5
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,224
Having cleansed her

6
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,361
by the washing of the water
with the Word,

7
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:12,800
that he might present the church
to himself in splendor,

8
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:16,470
without spot or wrinkle

9
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,439
or any such thing.

10
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,944
That she might be holy

11
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:27,381
and without blemish.

12
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,917
In the same way,

13
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:36,423
husbands should love their wives
as their own bodies.

14
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,797
He who loves his wife

15
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,801
loves himself.

16
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,771
For no one...

17
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,812
Thank you very much.

18
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:58,846
Ah, Maggie.

19
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,715
Beautiful sermon.

20
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,750
Good to see you, Maggie.

21
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,886
Alright, I'd find
the hair of dog.

22
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,788
- Yeah.
- Great work as usual.

23
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,222
- Nice job, brother.
- See you.

24
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,359
- Yeah.
- Alright.

25
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,761
Ah.

26
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:15,963
It was a beautiful sermon,
Reverend Fedder.

27
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,799
Thank you, Amelia.

28
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,601
I hope to have a husband
who loves me like that.

29
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:24,337
God will see to it,
I'm sure of it.

30
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,774
Are you here by yourself?

31
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,610
Your mother hasn't been
to services in a while.

32
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:30,611
Is she...

33
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,547
She started drinking again.

34
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,750
Mm.

35
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,486
Sometimes further initiative
is necessary.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,524
I could stop by your home
tomorrow, just talk to her.

37
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,292
- Could you, please?
- Oh, yeah.

38
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,327
She's been suffering
for a while now,

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,297
but I'm praying
for her happiness.

40
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,700
- I am.
- Oh.

41
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,438
Amelia.

42
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,975
Who's that?

43
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,617
Amelia.

44
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,554
Amelia.

45
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:16,871
<i>Moving the body up and down.</i>

46
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,850
Anne?

47
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,852
Anne?

48
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,690
Anne?

49
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,628
What?

50
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:45,566
Okay, well, thanks for...
thanks for calling.

51
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,570
What is it?

52
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,107
So she was walking home,

53
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,209
and that's the last
you saw of her?

54
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,611
Think she might have run away?

55
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,146
Well, Jakob was gonna
go visit...

56
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,083
I was planning to stop by
their house today.

57
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:06,187
Um, Amelia was concerned about
her mother's drinking.

58
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,556
Yeah, I saw Lucy earlier.

59
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,758
She's definitely
back on the sauce.

60
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,793
It's a Goddamn shame.

61
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:14,996
Oh, I'm sorry about
the blasphemy.

62
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,864
- Don't worry about it.
- That's alright.

63
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,733
Living alone
with an alcoholic parent

64
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,302
can be cause to skip town.

65
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,938
I-I don't think
that Amelia would

66
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,108
leave her mother's house
in the middle of the night.

67
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,976
I mean, she believed
that her mother was...

68
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,145
Amelia had faith.

69
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,615
You two are using past tense.
Do you suspect foul play?

70
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:38,119
Apologies.
Amelia <i>has</i> faith.

71
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:40,755
Well, these situations can be
a nightmare for everyone,

72
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:45,026
so it's easy to
assume the worst.

73
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,863
Were you gonna say
something else, Anne?

74
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,198
Join us in prayer, Mike?

75
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,737
Oh, man.

76
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,342
Mmm.

77
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,311
It had to be the Goddamn father.

78
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,180
How many times
do I have to tell you

79
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,783
not to take the Lord's name
in vain?

80
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:12,086
Her father died of cancer
when she was a baby, Bob.

81
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,854
Carol's right.

82
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,090
Lucy raised Amelia on her own.

83
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,225
You sound just like Dad,

84
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:21,062
always looking for the good
qualities in people.

85
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,763
But guess what.

86
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,899
9 times out of 10,
when a child goes missing,

87
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,600
it's a relative or a boyfriend.

88
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,903
Did she have a boyfriend?

89
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,372
Oh, I mean, that's it, then.

90
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,773
They probably ran off together.

91
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,309
They're just doing
stupid kid stuff.

92
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,612
Well, we can only hope
it's something so reckless.

93
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:42,149
Sheriff Hess, he says
they've hit a dead end.

94
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,018
Amelia wasn't like that.

95
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,924
Her mother had problems,

96
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:53,094
but Amelia was loyal to her.

97
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:57,264
Good people don't just
leave their families.

98
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,237
Oh, come on.

99
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,306
You expect me to believe
a teenage girl

100
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,008
doesn't have a boyfriend or two?

101
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:11,278
Carol, how many boyfriends
did you have in high school?

102
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:14,014
Don't shame me
because I was popular.

103
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:20,087
I just don't understand
why a young girl goes missing

104
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:22,256
and you're all so quick
to blame her.

105
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,158
Nobody's blaming her, Anne.

106
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,662
But really, what can we do
besides pray for the best?

107
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,931
She'll turn up.

108
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,300
Don't worry.

109
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,500
Anne.

110
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,181
Oh, geez, I forgot to tell you.

111
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:59,987
The proposal for the gin mill
went through.

112
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,389
Is that actually happening?

113
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,225
Yeah.

114
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:08,295
The Historical Society thinks,
whew, this new retail space

115
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:13,067
will provide a lot of tourism
and jobs.

116
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,303
Mm, while gutting our history.

117
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,308
Well, I don't know about that.

118
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:25,446
The basic foundation of the mill
won't be altered.

119
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,516
We fought hard for that.

120
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:35,122
We even hired a design firm
with some local experience.

121
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,091
Do you remember Tom Low?

122
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,895
Tom Low?

123
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,098
Your old flame?

124
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,001
Hardly call him that.

125
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,271
I mean, we were just kids.

126
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:53,374
Anyway, he is coming into town,

127
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:58,345
so I'm gonna meet with him.

128
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,451
Well, tell Tom I said hi.

129
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,263
Tom?

130
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,165
Are you hiding back here?

131
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,034
I was going for mysterious.

132
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,471
I'm not surprised.
You were two peas in a pod.

133
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,039
True, true. We were.

134
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,308
She is the one that labled me
Mr. Mischievous.

135
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:05,913
Yeah, you... you were
uncontrollable in those days.

136
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:09,083
I was. I know I was.

137
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,986
You know, Anne...

138
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,092
I am surprised that you
wound up marrying Jakob.

139
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,164
I don't know how to take that.

140
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,966
I mean, I like Jakob.
Don't get me wrong.

141
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,401
I-I don't mean to insult you
or Jakob.

142
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,670
That's not what I'm saying.

143
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:30,938
It's just that, you,
a church mouse?

144
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,272
I don't...

145
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,941
I don't understand.

146
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,943
Whatever happened to
the adventurous Anne

147
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:40,013
that wanted to go travel
in exotic places and...

148
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,016
What about moving to Cairo?

149
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,920
- Remember that fantasy?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

150
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,923
I don't know.

151
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,695
You make plans for things
and then...

152
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:57,164
Life happens, I guess.

153
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,966
It was, um...

154
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,269
I think it was around the time
that... that you left town

155
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,973
that my mother died.

156
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:10,110
And...

157
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:13,581
Jakob was there for me.

158
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:18,252
He offered me comfort.

159
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,688
So did the church.

160
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:23,625
They were both steady
when I needed support.

161
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,497
Uh...

162
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,332
Make no mistake,
we have a good life.

163
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:37,104
We do. I'm... I'm... I'm happy.

164
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,675
Yeah.

165
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,646
To happiness.

166
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,548
Ahh.

167
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,431
Wow. This brings back memories.

168
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,539
Remember when
we used to come here?

169
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:14,676
How could I forget?

170
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,689
So, what do you think?

171
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,792
I got to be honest with you.

172
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:35,630
This job has got me
flying all around the world.

173
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,264
But when I heard about
this project,

174
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,400
I jumped at the offer
because of you.

175
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,672
I hope that's not the only
reason you're here.

176
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:49,142
Well, it's not the only reason.

177
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,493
Anne!

178
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,829
What in the hell was that?

179
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:09,429
I don't know.

180
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,766
Hello?

181
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,143
Watch your step.

182
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,151
We'll have to air all this out.

183
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,121
Yeah.

184
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,392
Tom.

185
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,731
Tom?

186
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,135
Tom!

187
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,471
Oh! Oh, my God. You scared me.
Don't do that.

188
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:56,343
- Oh, I got you good.
- You are terrible.

189
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,713
Ah, so I've been told.

190
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,518
Where did those come from?

191
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,456
- They weren't here before?
- No.

192
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:18,733
They're comfy.

193
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,535
Have a seat.

194
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:22,670
I won't bite you.

195
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:24,772
I'm not so sure.

196
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:58,740
Ohh.

197
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:03,276
You are still
so dangerously handsome.

198
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,815
What's wrong, Anne?

199
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:12,587
This is so tempting.

200
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,423
I just can't do it to Jakob.

201
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:23,263
Are you sure?

202
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,670
Yes, Tommy.

203
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,338
Thank you for asking.

204
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,876
Feelings come and go, but...

205
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,645
commitments...

206
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:41,849
Oh!

207
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,754
The hell was that?

208
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,635
Oh!

209
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:02,235
Did you see the size
of that thing?

210
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:09,777
No, Tom, don't.

211
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,344
Shh.

212
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,022
No? Thanks, Bob.

213
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,824
I thought it was a long shot.

214
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:58,593
I just...

215
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,494
you know, wondered
if she might have

216
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:01,829
popped over to see Carol.

217
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:04,999
Oh, never mind.

218
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,768
She's home.

219
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,537
Okay, talk soon.

220
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,345
Anne.

221
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,715
Where you been?

222
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,885
At the mill.

223
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:26,921
Oh. How'd it go?

224
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,524
Fine.

225
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:33,326
Well, it's really late,
you know?

226
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,463
I know.

227
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:39,066
I'm going to bed.

228
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,103
Fine.

229
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:46,007
I'll, um, be up later.

230
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:39,452
<i>Reach.</i>

231
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:46,426
<i>More aggressive.
Pull the elbow.</i>

232
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:50,463
<i>Notice the springing motion
of the body.</i>

233
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,966
<i>Up and down.</i>

234
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:57,939
<i>Back to front.</i>

235
00:23:57,972 --> 00:23:59,140
<i>Reach.</i>

236
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:01,742
Uh, I'm heading in soon.

237
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:04,545
Did you make breakfast?

238
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,213
<i>And back down.</i>

239
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:09,917
I'm not hungry.

240
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,719
<i>And back up.</i>

241
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,888
Uh, I guess I'll just
pick something up

242
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:15,690
- on my way into town.
- Bye.

243
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,959
<i>Five, six.
Get ready to grape vine.</i>

244
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:21,095
<i>To the right side.
Two, three, four.</i>

245
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,969
What are you?

246
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:06,741
What do you want?

247
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:20,955
Who are you?

248
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:25,292
And what do you want?

249
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,767
Who are you?

250
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,837
And what do you want?

251
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:53,788
Hand it over.

252
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,289
Hand what over?

253
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,024
You know what I mean.

254
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,860
Fuck you, old man.
This ain't the 1980s anymore.

255
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:01,796
Yeah. It's still illegal
in this state.

256
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:04,031
Why don't you go molest
an altar boy or something, huh?

257
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:07,068
You mistake me for a priest.

258
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,637
I'm a minister.

259
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,039
This is a church.

260
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:14,875
You should go home.

261
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,777
Don't you know there's a girl
your age missing?

262
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,914
Hey, cool it, Oscar.

263
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:22,083
We want the cops called on us
or what?

264
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,885
Fucking hate
old white dudes.

265
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:49,844
Hello?

266
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:12,666
Ahh.

267
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,084
Aah!

268
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:32,019
Geez. Ohh.

269
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:35,990
Oh, good. You're home.

270
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:41,862
Get changed.

271
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,364
I'd like to go out.

272
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:05,352
So, uh...

273
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:07,254
What's the occasion?

274
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:11,058
Does there need to be one?

275
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:15,696
No, not really.

276
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,333
It's just unusual.

277
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,938
I must be feeling unusual.

278
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,184
Could I get a to-go box
for my wife, please?

279
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:39,887
Actually, I'm finished.

280
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,356
I'm sorry, what?

281
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:16,890
It's good.
You'll like it.

282
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:02,403
Ah!

283
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,941
I was just having a bad dream.

284
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,347
I hope that's all it was.

285
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,982
What's that mean?

286
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:21,088
Let's talk about this later.

287
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,123
Why do you always do this?

288
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:24,391
Do what?

289
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,292
Shut me down, push me aside.

290
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:27,127
- You...
- Oh, come on. That's not true.

291
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,462
Will you stop interrupting me?

292
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:31,065
Let me finish my thought,
God damn it.

293
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,608
Sorry.

294
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,493
I don't know what's gotten
into you lately.

295
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:03,631
But I need to prepare
the week's sermon.

296
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:06,066
If that's okay.

297
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,404
You know, I'm just gonna
get something to eat

298
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,339
on the way into town.

299
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:14,174
And don't blaspheme.

300
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:29,450
Ma'am, can I help you
find something?

301
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:36,624
How much of that could I get?

302
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,096
You want the blood?

303
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,923
Anne.

304
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:38,231
Jakob.

305
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:41,769
Bob's just on an investor call.
Come on in.

306
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:45,606
Want some coffee or tea?

307
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,241
Uh, you got something
a little bit stronger?

308
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:50,545
Uh, tea with a shot of brandy?

309
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:52,245
How about just the brandy.

310
00:36:57,652 --> 00:36:59,654
Alright.

311
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,991
Hey.

312
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:07,427
Where's Anne?

313
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:09,329
Uh...

314
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,437
Look, I just don't think
Anne's the type to fool around.

315
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:18,438
I've already told you that.

316
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:19,807
I'm not saying she is.

317
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,709
But ever since
she met with Tom Low,

318
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:23,443
she hasn't been acting right.

319
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:24,979
I mean, 40 years
I've known this woman.

320
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:26,514
Every day the same.

321
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,348
Now I don't know who
I'm coming home to.

322
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:31,552
She's hot, she's cold,
she's got a new dress, new hair.

323
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:34,622
I-I can't figure her out.

324
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:38,391
You got to confront him, then.

325
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,293
I can't do that to Anne.

326
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,063
It's your wife, Jakey.

327
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,831
What do you think I would do

328
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:47,367
if Carol came home with
that kind of bullshit?

329
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,403
Yeah, well, I don't know
where to find him.

330
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,940
He's down here working
in the mill, right?

331
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,842
So start there and don't stop

332
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:57,612
until he understands
the damn message.

333
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:59,446
Hm.

334
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:03,416
Wow.

335
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:08,723
Just do it before we come over
this weekend for dinner.

336
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,892
'Cause Carol's making lasagna,

337
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:14,562
and I just don't want things
to be all weird.

338
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:15,990
Anne.

339
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,959
Ohh.

340
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:38,940
Anne!

341
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,476
What are you doing?

342
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:56,123
In his second letter
to the Corinthians,

343
00:40:56,157 --> 00:41:00,928
Paul takes this idea
a step further

344
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:05,066
and asks directly

345
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,736
"How do you know, husband,

346
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:13,574
whether you will
save your wife?"

347
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:16,544
And the answer, of course,
is you can never know.

348
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:24,552
And so we are left with faith...

349
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:34,061
...in the promise that
God will take every situation

350
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:39,066
and turn it to His purpose.

351
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:46,974
What on God's green earth
have you been eating?

352
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,276
I swear, Anne,
this looks like dirt.

353
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:52,146
Now you're just being cruel.

354
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,515
Cruel is when you see my bill.

355
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:01,822
That's odd.

356
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:03,924
You've got new teeth coming in.

357
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,795
What?

358
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:11,766
It's rare,
but it's not unheard of.

359
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:15,069
We should set an appointment
and check them out.

360
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:17,071
Here. Rinse.

361
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:23,010
Let's brighten that smile.

362
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:13,420
Tom Low?

363
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:56,297
Tom Low?

364
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,032
It's Jakob Fedder.

365
00:44:58,065 --> 00:45:01,302
Anne's husband.

366
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:04,038
I need to talk to you.

367
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:58,359
- Aah!
- Man!

368
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:00,261
Geez! Ah!

369
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:02,997
Creepy old man, I don't know why
you have such a hard-on for us,

370
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,532
but why don't you piss off?

371
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:06,800
Sorry. Sorry. I'm...
I was looking for someone else.

372
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,502
Yeah, cool it, Oscar.
He's harmless.

373
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:10,371
Yeah. No, she's right.
I'm leaving.

374
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:13,240
Kick rocks. Go.
Get the fuck out of here.

375
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,543
Come on, let's go.

376
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:18,078
Hey! Aah!

377
00:46:18,112 --> 00:46:20,582
Oh, sh... Hey, man, come on,
I'm just...

378
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:22,082
I was just playing, man.

379
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:23,951
Just stay back.

380
00:46:23,984 --> 00:46:26,353
Come on, man.
I was just playing.

381
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:46,440
Amelia!

382
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:49,009
How's my suffering mother?

383
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:50,210
Did you bless her?

384
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:52,379
With God's almighty love?

385
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,381
Are you here to bless me now?

386
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:56,984
Because I don't want
your God's love.

387
00:46:57,017 --> 00:47:03,190
I've found a new savior.

388
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:10,130
With a love that gives me
strength instead of fear.

389
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:12,232
A love for myself.

390
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,603
And right now...

391
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:17,304
Aah!

392
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:21,108
...my master...

393
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:24,512
is in your house.

394
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:20,702
Anne.

395
00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:25,372
The Lord is my savior.

396
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:26,674
He restoreth my soul.

397
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:28,475
He leads me in the path
of righteousness.

398
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,611
Bullshit!

399
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:31,945
Lord, forgive her.

400
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:33,447
She's corrupted.

401
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,350
Give me the strength
to save her wayward soul.

402
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:44,024
I'm gonna tongue-fuck
a hole in your neck

403
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:48,563
until I puke blood.

404
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:53,100
Take that, bitch.

405
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,335
Go, go!

406
00:49:10,017 --> 00:49:12,219
Why the fuck would she do that?!

407
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,288
Shit bit Oscar's throat!

408
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:15,690
She killed him!

409
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:17,659
Look, we're safe out here, okay?

410
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:20,260
That was some motherfuckin'
vampire shit, okay?!

411
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:21,563
We need to report it.

412
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:24,164
I got to check on my wife.

413
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:25,700
Fuck off, then!

414
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,267
I'm going to the cops.

415
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:50,625
Is she having a heart attack?

416
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:52,493
Hey, Mrs. Fedder, you alright?

417
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:58,766
Mrs. Fedder, you...

418
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:05,272
You okay in ther...

419
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:09,243
You alright... Mrs. Fedder!

420
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,380
Mrs. Fedder?

421
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:17,351
Hello?

422
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:19,654
Hey, are you okay in here?

423
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:26,059
Hey, Mrs. Fedder?

424
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,396
Hello?

425
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:31,365
Hey.

426
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:36,571
Hey, you alright?

427
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:40,474
Hey, could you say something,
please?

428
00:50:40,508 --> 00:50:44,779
This is getting...
fairly uncomfortable for me.

429
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:47,214
Suf...

430
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:09,837
No, no, no, no. God!

431
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:11,405
No.

432
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:15,777
Anne!

433
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:24,451
Aaah!

434
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:29,624
I'm sorry, Jakob!

435
00:51:29,657 --> 00:51:31,859
It wasn't me.

436
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:34,696
- Of course it was you!
- No!

437
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:37,464
I-I didn't want to do it!
I was being controlled!

438
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:39,601
This isn't me!
It isn't me!

439
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:41,501
Well, who is it, then?!

440
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:46,239
Something... happened, Jakob.

441
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:47,909
What does that mean?

442
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:51,879
- Something happened? When?
- The day that I met with Tom...

443
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:53,447
I kissed him, okay?

444
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,415
But then...

445
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:14,434
This is so f...

446
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,504
effed up!

447
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,656
Reverend.

448
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:36,390
Hey, Mike.

449
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:39,661
- Any news on Amelia?
- Uh, sort of.

450
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:41,395
Well, not really.

451
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:43,263
It's strange, actually.

452
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:44,966
Strange?

453
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:48,435
Do you know of a young women
by the name of Eli Shenks?

454
00:52:48,468 --> 00:52:51,271
No, I don't think so.

455
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:52,974
You sure you haven't seen her
skateboarding around town

456
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:54,709
with her boyfriend, Oscar?

457
00:52:54,742 --> 00:52:57,645
Anyway, she dropped by
the station in quite a state.

458
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,379
She claims Oscar was murdered

459
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,683
at the old Cripple Creek Mill...

460
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:03,751
by a vampire.

461
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:06,688
And she identified Amelia.

462
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:09,624
I chalk that up
to really bad taste on her part.

463
00:53:09,657 --> 00:53:11,693
But still, we had to go up there
and check it out.

464
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:13,460
Yeah. And...?

465
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:15,362
And there was nothing.

466
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:16,631
No body, no blood.

467
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:18,365
Well...

468
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:20,434
that must be a relief.

469
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:24,572
Yeah, except she swears
that you were there.

470
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:27,842
Um...

471
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,409
Well, I don't know what
she's talking about.

472
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:31,478
- I wasn't at the mill.
- Oh, of course not.

473
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,313
I mean, she says you were
the one fighting the vampires.

474
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:37,451
- That's...
- Crazy, right?

475
00:53:37,484 --> 00:53:38,820
Yeah.

476
00:53:38,853 --> 00:53:40,021
Yeah, I'm just assuming
that's just some

477
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:42,289
drugged-up preoccupation
on her part.

478
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:44,525
Oh.

479
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,493
There is one thing
we found out there, though.

480
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:50,798
Isn't that your church's stamp?

481
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:52,767
I mean,
what do you make of that?

482
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:57,304
I have no idea.

483
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:58,506
Hmm.

484
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:01,642
Yeah. Me neither.

485
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:03,878
You know, normally I wouldn't
take these things so seriously,

486
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:06,480
but the boy did go missing.

487
00:54:06,514 --> 00:54:08,716
Just like Amelia and Tom Low.

488
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:13,888
Tom Low?

489
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,858
- Well, he lives in Chicago.
- He does.

490
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:18,593
He came down here
to do some business.

491
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:20,995
We found his vehicle abandoned
up at the mill, also.

492
00:54:21,028 --> 00:54:22,897
He could have just skipped town.
Who knows?

493
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,498
But still, the timing is just...

494
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,703
...odd.

495
00:54:28,736 --> 00:54:30,938
Anyway, I'm sorry to bother you
with all this stuff.

496
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:32,339
Just tell Anne I said hello.

497
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:33,541
Sounds like she's pretty...

498
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,575
busy at the moment.

499
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:36,309
She is. Yeah.

500
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:38,613
Okay. Well, Mike, you take care.

501
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:41,716
Yeah. You, too.

502
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:47,354
Why didn't you tell me
when this first happened?

503
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:49,322
I could have helped you.

504
00:54:52,894 --> 00:54:54,662
I felt ashamed.

505
00:54:56,597 --> 00:54:58,533
As you should.

506
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:10,343
I'm sorry I hurt you.

507
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:15,348
But there are blessings
to this change, you know?

508
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:17,919
I feel more alive
than I have in years.

509
00:55:17,952 --> 00:55:19,987
Yeah, well,
don't get used to it.

510
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:23,524
Drinking blood is not exactly
a sustainable lifestyle.

511
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:27,995
What do we do now?

512
00:55:30,665 --> 00:55:33,034
I find The Master that
Amelia was talking about,

513
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:34,602
and I kill him,

514
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:35,803
and I change you back

515
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:37,872
to the way you were.

516
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:39,707
The way I was?

517
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,374
Absolutely.

518
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:42,977
Exactly.

519
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:47,114
Put a stop to this insanity
before it goes any further.

520
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:10,905
What does he look like?

521
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:12,874
I don't know.

522
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:20,514
At first,
all I could see was a shadow.

523
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:24,819
A shape that I couldn't
really make out.

524
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:27,755
But with each visit...

525
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:30,591
the shape does become stronger.

526
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:36,163
Like... it's coming into focus.

527
00:56:36,197 --> 00:56:37,565
Well, I was
thinking about the mill

528
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,634
where you and Tom were attacked.

529
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:42,036
You know,
what was Amelia doing there?

530
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:44,639
I mean, are they all
hiding there?

531
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:47,575
It might be a pretty clever way
to get around the country,

532
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:50,144
dying towns and abandoned mills,

533
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:53,848
you know,
far from the prying eyes.

534
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:57,718
This town is perfect then.

535
00:56:58,953 --> 00:57:00,487
I'm just trying to figure out

536
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:03,490
why The Master would
keep coming after you.

537
00:57:07,228 --> 00:57:09,163
Are you jealous?

538
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:15,468
Well...

539
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:16,837
you lusted after another man,

540
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,839
and then you act...

541
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:20,808
Careful, Jakob.

542
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,646
Given the circumstances,

543
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,883
I think I'm being
quite reasonable.

544
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:52,773
Do you remember
when we started this?

545
00:57:55,242 --> 00:57:56,844
Of course.

546
00:57:58,846 --> 00:58:02,683
You asked for the seeds
as a wedding gift.

547
00:58:16,297 --> 00:58:20,234
I just think it's safer
if I go in alone.

548
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:23,170
I mean, we don't know how you're
gonna behave in his presence.

549
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:25,940
I mean, you could freak out,

550
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:29,210
you know,
or turn into a bat or something.

551
00:58:30,845 --> 00:58:33,214
I didn't come here
to sit in the car.

552
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:35,883
Well, it's too risky.

553
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:40,955
Besides, you don't have a stake.

554
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,293
- Pull over.
- Hmm?

555
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:48,763
You heard me.

556
00:59:01,142 --> 00:59:02,143
There.

557
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,878
Now I have a stake.

558
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:35,776
Are you ready?

559
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,645
What do you mean, ready?

560
00:59:37,678 --> 00:59:40,748
For whatever we find down there.

561
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:44,718
I'm a minister of the Lord,
Anne.

562
00:59:44,752 --> 00:59:47,121
This is what I was trained for,
to fight evil,

563
00:59:47,154 --> 00:59:49,023
whatever form it may come in.

564
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:52,126
Will you stop with
the Sunday School crap?

565
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,728
If we go down there,
we go together...

566
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:56,964
as equals.

567
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:59,100
Are you okay with that?

568
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:02,903
Let's just get this over with.

569
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:00,961
Amelia?

570
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,398
We've come to help you.

571
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:06,834
You've come
to help me, Reverend?

572
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:09,069
That's very considerate.

573
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:12,406
Perhaps you should
help your wife instead.

574
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:19,246
Or does he not find the new you
very attractive, Mrs. Fedder?

575
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,349
Obedience and submission...

576
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:24,952
that's more their style.

577
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:28,923
But... you have...
The Master's love now.

578
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,160
Aaaah!

579
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:34,428
There's not a Goddamn thing

580
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:36,497
you can do about it, shit bird.

581
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,803
Jakob, how could you?!

582
01:01:42,836 --> 01:01:44,506
Attacking a child.

583
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:46,373
Where is your compassion?

584
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:48,976
You have plenty for your wife,

585
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,512
even though she...

586
01:01:50,545 --> 01:01:52,413
- Shut up!
- Anne, please.

587
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:54,481
Can't you hear her.
She's still Amelia.

588
01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:56,383
Don't be an idiot.
Kill her.

589
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:57,952
No!

590
01:01:57,985 --> 01:01:59,486
No, there has to
be a better way.

591
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:02,022
- She's manipulating you.
- She's lying to you, Jakob.

592
01:02:02,056 --> 01:02:05,759
Lord, please, protect me.

593
01:02:10,064 --> 01:02:11,799
I knew you'd wuss out.

594
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:13,867
- I told you no!
- And I told you to kill her!

595
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,202
I could have saved her!

596
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:16,770
Where's your compassion
for God's sake?

597
01:02:16,804 --> 01:02:17,972
- Compassion?!
- You mercy?

598
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,507
Don't be naive, Jakob.

599
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,242
She would have sucked you dry.

600
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:23,844
What am I letting you
turn me into?!

601
01:02:23,877 --> 01:02:26,313
I can't do this!

602
01:02:28,115 --> 01:02:29,283
The Master might
still be in there.

603
01:02:29,316 --> 01:02:30,518
We need to finish this.

604
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:32,386
"The Master."
What does it matter?

605
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,288
You're no different
from him now.

606
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:36,524
- You two can have each other.
- How can you say that?

607
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:38,425
- I'm your wife!
- Not anymore.

608
01:02:38,459 --> 01:02:41,529
You belong to him.
That's your punishment.

609
01:02:41,563 --> 01:02:43,964
It's my what?

610
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:47,067
If you hadn't had your
little rendezvous with Tom Low,

611
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:48,369
none of this would be happening.

612
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:51,839
This isn't about
Tom or The Master.

613
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:54,074
This is about us, you and me.

614
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:55,976
You had sin in your heart,

615
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,379
and you brought this
on yourself.

616
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:02,316
So, you're blaming me
for being bitten by a vampire?

617
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:05,085
Well, guess what.

618
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,987
I think you're just saying
these horrible things

619
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,889
because you're scared.

620
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:10,424
You're scared to fight for me

621
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:11,992
because ever since
we got married,

622
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:13,360
you haven't had to.

623
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:15,262
I've always just been there,

624
01:03:15,296 --> 01:03:18,032
doing exactly what you
expected me to do.

625
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:21,468
You don't know how
to fight for me

626
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:24,238
because you've never done it.

627
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:27,174
So instead...

628
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:29,076
you're just writing me off

629
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:32,179
as some fallen scarlet woman.

630
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:39,887
And that's pathetic and weak.

631
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,122
You're weak.

632
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:44,626
Think what you want.

633
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:47,928
I've already crossed
too many lines for you.

634
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:49,997
You're a Goddamn coward.

635
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,567
I'm getting out of this
while I still can,

636
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,638
while I still have
a little piece of my soul left!

637
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:03,877
Maybe I like who I am now!

638
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:57,364
What am I doin'?

639
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:19,587
Annie?

640
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:39,166
Aaah!

641
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,133
Jakob?

642
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:20,400
Jakob?

643
01:08:54,636 --> 01:08:57,204
With one gesture...

644
01:08:57,237 --> 01:09:00,307
this could get very messy.

645
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,410
Hurting him won't make me yours.

646
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:06,514
I seek no ownership.

647
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:08,916
This is about you.

648
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,686
Try and fight it.

649
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:17,725
But you are no longer
what you once were.

650
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:22,563
Why keep letting this anchor
drag you down?

651
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,336
Because I love him.

652
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:33,306
Die or thrive.

653
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,475
The choice is yours.

654
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,583
Please...

655
01:09:44,418 --> 01:09:46,654
No! No!

656
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:50,390
Don't!

657
01:10:18,418 --> 01:10:20,621
It's gonna get a lot worse.

658
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:13,340
Thank you.

659
01:11:31,391 --> 01:11:33,060
That's not good.

660
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:34,796
We're running out of time.

661
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,931
We got to find her,

662
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:38,666
and then we're gonna beat this
together.

663
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:40,034
This is just a test.

664
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:41,769
This...

665
01:11:41,803 --> 01:11:44,404
thirst is getting unbearable.

666
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:45,773
Well, what about the raw meat?

667
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:48,375
Did you even try it?

668
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:49,744
It's all trash.

669
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:52,680
It doesn't do anything.

670
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:54,549
Look, look.

671
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:56,784
You got to fight it.
It's just a sickness.

672
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:59,020
I'm sick, alright?

673
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:03,858
My thoughts are drenched
in blood.

674
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:05,993
River of blood.

675
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:12,533
I've got an idea.

676
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:26,581
You're right.
It is helping.

677
01:12:30,585 --> 01:12:33,120
Dare to take drugs off of kids.

678
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:42,597
It's been a long time
since I heard your laugh.

679
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:46,100
It's been a long time
since I felt like laughing.

680
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:53,473
I'm sorry I talk over you
sometimes.

681
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:58,378
Thank you.

682
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:02,783
I'm sorry I don't speak up
more often.

683
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:12,927
What do we do now?

684
01:13:16,097 --> 01:13:17,632
Pray for a miracle.

685
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:29,610
Hello.

686
01:13:29,644 --> 01:13:33,214
Yes. Of course.
How are you?

687
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:34,949
Oh.

688
01:13:34,982 --> 01:13:36,984
Sorry to hear that.

689
01:13:38,953 --> 01:13:41,989
Sure.
Be happy to check on her.

690
01:13:42,023 --> 01:13:45,092
No problem at all.

691
01:13:45,126 --> 01:13:47,695
Okay.
I'll call you back.

692
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:53,134
Are you okay to drive?

693
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:30,905
Is The Master here?

694
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:01,702
Mattie?

695
01:15:01,736 --> 01:15:04,739
It's Mr. and Mrs. Fedder.

696
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:06,107
Your daughter called.

697
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,943
She said you weren't answering
your phone.

698
01:15:56,057 --> 01:15:58,159
Oh, Mattie.

699
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:05,766
I don't see any bites.

700
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,608
What do we do?

701
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:20,081
Oh, Lord.

702
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:22,683
Thank you
for this bountiful gift

703
01:16:22,716 --> 01:16:23,951
in our time of need.

704
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:25,219
Amen.

705
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:31,058
It's a sign, Annie.

706
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:06,927
That looks heavy.

707
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:09,330
This is... just our laundry.

708
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:12,967
Yeah.
Mrs. Perkins washed it for us.

709
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,369
It doesn't look like laundry
to me.

710
01:17:15,402 --> 01:17:19,707
It looks like Mrs. Perkins
all rolled up in a bedspread.

711
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,242
Go inside.

712
01:17:21,275 --> 01:17:25,045
Only if you tell me
a swear word.

713
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:26,780
I'm not telling you
a swear word.

714
01:17:26,814 --> 01:17:29,350
Well, then I'm staying
right here.

715
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:30,384
Okay.

716
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:32,453
How about this one?

717
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,854
Fuck off.

718
01:17:33,888 --> 01:17:36,423
Already know that one.

719
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,298
Alright.

720
01:18:01,115 --> 01:18:02,983
Hess here.

721
01:18:03,017 --> 01:18:04,885
Mike, it's... it's Mariana.

722
01:18:04,919 --> 01:18:07,154
Listen, I don't know
how to say this, um...

723
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:09,056
but, uh...

724
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:10,958
Well, what's wrong?

725
01:18:13,227 --> 01:18:15,796
It's the Reverend Fedder.

726
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:18,199
I think I saw him
and Mrs. Fedder

727
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:20,167
carrying a body
into their house.

728
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:40,287
What are you doing!
Come on!

729
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:44,158
I can't be part of this.

730
01:18:45,926 --> 01:18:48,462
You know,
it's an hour till sunset.

731
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:53,434
I'd like to go check
if The Master is

732
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:55,002
holed up there.

733
01:18:56,937 --> 01:18:59,840
We should do it together.

734
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:01,809
That's what we are doing.

735
01:19:11,485 --> 01:19:13,787
Go gentle on her.

736
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:58,098
Oh, fuck.

737
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,169
Hey, Mike.
What's up?

738
01:20:35,202 --> 01:20:36,571
Hi, Jakob.

739
01:20:36,604 --> 01:20:38,972
I could really use your help
with something.

740
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:41,208
Would you turn the engine off
and step out here.

741
01:20:41,241 --> 01:20:44,044
It would really save my back
the unnecessary strain.

742
01:20:52,219 --> 01:20:54,488
What's in the case?

743
01:20:54,522 --> 01:20:56,223
Uh, nothing.

744
01:20:56,256 --> 01:20:57,958
Just hospital supplies

745
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:01,228
for administering last rites
and so forth.

746
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:02,963
You mind if we take a look.

747
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:04,498
Well, yes, I would, actually.

748
01:21:04,532 --> 01:21:07,434
I'm on my way to an important
appointment right now.

749
01:21:07,468 --> 01:21:12,473
Uh, I got to see
a very sick patient.

750
01:21:12,507 --> 01:21:14,208
- Very sick.
- You know what?

751
01:21:14,241 --> 01:21:15,943
Why don't we indulge
Deputy Colton?

752
01:21:15,976 --> 01:21:17,478
He's coming up with
a performance review

753
01:21:17,512 --> 01:21:18,946
end of the month, right?

754
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:20,247
He could really use
the experience.

755
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,248
Isn't that right, Colton?

756
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:22,617
Right as rain, Sheriff.

757
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:25,553
Step on back here, Jakob.

758
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:35,062
This is not what you think.

759
01:21:35,095 --> 01:21:37,030
Oh, I'm sure we've seen worse.

760
01:21:47,374 --> 01:21:49,577
But it's vacation.
You get to do what you want.

761
01:21:49,611 --> 01:21:51,111
Yeah.

762
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:52,580
That's what you say every time,

763
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:55,182
and I never get to do
about half of what I want.

764
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:57,084
Oh, come on.

765
01:21:57,117 --> 01:22:00,187
Well, let's pick... You pick
the place this time then.

766
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,188
Fine.

767
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:03,056
Do whatever you want.

768
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,324
<i>You</i> can do whatever you want.

769
01:22:04,358 --> 01:22:06,226
I just want a margarita.

770
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,530
As long
as you don't puke this time.

771
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:17,204
- Thank you.
- Always, babe.

772
01:22:19,641 --> 01:22:21,175
A long week.

773
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:23,410
Yeah, it sucks.

774
01:22:23,444 --> 01:22:25,479
I didn't go with
the spinach this time.

775
01:22:25,513 --> 01:22:27,549
I'm getting sick of it.

776
01:22:27,582 --> 01:22:29,283
I prefer your meat anyways.

777
01:22:29,316 --> 01:22:31,519
That's good stuff.

778
01:22:31,553 --> 01:22:33,487
Thank you.

779
01:22:52,206 --> 01:22:54,074
Anne!

780
01:22:59,112 --> 01:23:03,383
You ever see something
you couldn't explain, Sheriff?

781
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:06,320
Oh, like a vampire, Jakob?

782
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:11,659
How many people have you killed,
Reverend?

783
01:23:13,427 --> 01:23:15,329
<i>Sheriff Hess,</i>

784
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:18,398
<i>you are never gonna believe
the call that just came in.</i>

785
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:23,237
Uh, yeah.

786
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,772
Yeah. Of course.

787
01:23:24,806 --> 01:23:27,542
Okay. Okay. Yes.

788
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:29,443
Yes.

789
01:23:29,476 --> 01:23:30,645
Uh-huh.

790
01:23:30,678 --> 01:23:33,080
Okay. I will.

791
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:36,518
Thank you, officer.
We'll be here.

792
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:38,753
J... Just give me a sec.

793
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:42,724
This is absolutely fucked,

794
01:23:42,757 --> 01:23:44,458
and if you drag Jakob
into this shit,

795
01:23:44,491 --> 01:23:47,729
I will kill you
before the cops get here.

796
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:53,100
What is taking them so long?
I mean, what is going on?

797
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:55,670
- I can't stay here anymore.
- They'll be here, okay?

798
01:23:55,703 --> 01:23:58,606
Just wait outside for them,
okay, huh?

799
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,842
I love you.

800
01:24:02,877 --> 01:24:04,478
Yeah.

801
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:09,817
I did hear that.

802
01:24:09,851 --> 01:24:13,788
No, she's still sitting there.
She hasn't said a word.

803
01:24:13,821 --> 01:24:16,624
Believe me,
I haven't taken my eyes off her.

804
01:24:20,127 --> 01:24:21,194
Aah!

805
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,136
Goddamn it!

806
01:24:29,169 --> 01:24:30,672
Carol!

807
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:35,342
Carol!

808
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,878
Carol!

809
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:46,688
Run and don't look back.

810
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:49,122
Yeah, right.

811
01:24:49,156 --> 01:24:50,658
Get up.

812
01:25:10,712 --> 01:25:13,447
Carol?

813
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,149
What in the hell are you doing?

814
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:29,296
Adam was born first,

815
01:25:29,329 --> 01:25:31,331
and then Eve.

816
01:25:31,365 --> 01:25:33,901
It was not Adam
who was deceived,

817
01:25:33,935 --> 01:25:38,238
but the woman who was deceived
and fell into transgression.

818
01:25:38,271 --> 01:25:41,676
Does that sound fair to you?

819
01:25:41,709 --> 01:25:43,911
My husband is a good man.

820
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:48,415
What does "good"
have to do with it?

821
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:51,686
He is afraid
of the life within you.

822
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:54,287
And you're not?

823
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:56,858
I choose those I change

824
01:25:56,891 --> 01:25:58,526
with care.

825
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:11,405
The rest are just pets.

826
01:26:11,438 --> 01:26:14,909
Oh!

827
01:26:17,912 --> 01:26:19,547
Anne...

828
01:26:21,549 --> 01:26:23,551
No!

829
01:27:07,729 --> 01:27:11,331
It's good to see you strong,
Anne.

830
01:27:11,364 --> 01:27:13,568
What do you want from me?

831
01:27:13,601 --> 01:27:15,803
Why do you always think

832
01:27:15,837 --> 01:27:19,941
in terms of what others want?

833
01:27:19,974 --> 01:27:26,346
Where do you think
that sad instinct comes from?

834
01:27:26,379 --> 01:27:29,617
I, too, was once a mouse,

835
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:31,686
scurrying between the feet

836
01:27:31,719 --> 01:27:34,789
of self-important men.

837
01:27:34,822 --> 01:27:38,926
Until the day my master

838
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:44,966
gifted me the kiss of eternity.

839
01:27:44,999 --> 01:27:47,034
It gave me confidence.

840
01:27:47,068 --> 01:27:50,337
It freed me from the shackles

841
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:54,642
of domestic dependency.

842
01:27:54,675 --> 01:27:59,981
I see the same potential in you.

843
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:02,415
What exactly

844
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:05,753
do you want, Anne?

845
01:28:13,694 --> 01:28:17,064
I want to live a bigger life.

846
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:21,836
You can.

847
01:28:21,869 --> 01:28:24,772
The choice has always

848
01:28:24,806 --> 01:28:28,609
been yours.

849
01:28:28,643 --> 01:28:32,379
Is that why
I haven't fully turned.

850
01:28:32,412 --> 01:28:34,515
Indeed.

851
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:39,419
Taste my blood,

852
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:42,690
and you'll control the hunger.

853
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:45,458
You'll be beholden to nothing

854
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:48,563
but your own whims.

855
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:50,097
But if you don't,

856
01:28:50,131 --> 01:28:51,833
the hunger will continue

857
01:28:51,866 --> 01:28:54,635
to control you day

858
01:28:54,669 --> 01:28:55,870
after day...

859
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:58,573
- Aaaah!
- Colton!

860
01:28:58,606 --> 01:29:00,775
I got him, Sheriff.

861
01:29:00,808 --> 01:29:03,544
Deputy, I thought
you said you got him.

862
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:09,150
They'll never accept you now.

863
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:18,659
What the fuck?

864
01:29:21,562 --> 01:29:24,632
Your life could be
so much bigger

865
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:27,500
than this, Anne.

866
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,649
It's time you made a decision

867
01:29:41,682 --> 01:29:44,552
for yourself.

868
01:29:44,585 --> 01:29:46,621
I'm stuck, Sheriff!

869
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:48,522
What's that?

870
01:29:52,727 --> 01:29:54,896
Oh, shit!

871
01:29:57,031 --> 01:29:59,432
Ask yourself...

872
01:29:59,466 --> 01:30:02,169
how different the world seemed

873
01:30:02,203 --> 01:30:03,738
this week?

874
01:30:03,771 --> 01:30:05,806
How it sounded.

875
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,209
How it tasted.

876
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,811
30 years

877
01:30:10,845 --> 01:30:13,214
of being dutiful,

878
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:15,482
obedient,

879
01:30:15,516 --> 01:30:17,551
supportive.

880
01:30:17,585 --> 01:30:23,591
But never satisfied
your own desires.

881
01:30:23,624 --> 01:30:26,694
Were you... ever...

882
01:30:26,727 --> 01:30:29,597
really you?

883
01:30:32,166 --> 01:30:36,871
Or were you just Jakob's wife?

884
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:44,745
"The great dragon was
thrown down,

885
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:46,814
that old serpent,

886
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:49,951
who was called the Devil
and Satan,

887
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:53,054
deceiver of the whole world..."

888
01:30:53,087 --> 01:30:57,191
This is just their nature!

889
01:30:57,224 --> 01:31:02,730
This is how they'll always be.

890
01:31:02,763 --> 01:31:04,966
"Thrown down into the world

891
01:31:04,999 --> 01:31:08,035
and all his angels with him."

892
01:31:38,165 --> 01:31:40,901
What have you done?

893
01:31:42,303 --> 01:31:43,838
I finished it.

894
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:45,206
That's what I've done.

895
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:47,875
It wasn't your choice to make.

896
01:31:54,982 --> 01:31:57,685
How you gonna write
this one up, Deputy?

897
01:32:00,855 --> 01:32:02,890
Domestic dispute.

898
01:32:02,923 --> 01:32:05,726
Non-violent.

899
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,094
Yeah.

900
01:32:07,128 --> 01:32:08,929
Yeah. That's a good answer.

901
01:32:13,134 --> 01:32:16,570
Listen, this is, uh...

902
01:32:16,604 --> 01:32:18,339
This is more your domain
than mine, Reverend.

903
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:26,881
But it needs to end tonight.

904
01:32:53,841 --> 01:32:55,876
What do we do now?

905
01:33:04,185 --> 01:33:06,387
Sell the house.

906
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,857
And just...

907
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:11,926
vanish.

908
01:33:11,959 --> 01:33:14,195
Hmm.

909
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:20,401
And I want to make
my own decisions

910
01:33:20,434 --> 01:33:24,004
from now on.

911
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:30,111
Do we look for a cure?

912
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:35,015
No.

01:33:35,049 --> 01:33:38,119
I like who I've become.

914
01:33:41,956 --> 01:33:44,325
The hunger will return.

915
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:50,764
But we can still have
a happy marriage...

916
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:54,401
...if we set some ground rules.

917
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:01,976
So, I'm supposed to trust you?
