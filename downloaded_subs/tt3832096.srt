¶ That you're wandering
in this place ¶

184
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,659
-We gonna go swimming?

185
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,395
¶ I thought it changed

186
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,099
¶ But the more
it stays the same ¶

187
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,968
I'll race you to the island!

00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,478
-You know Toby Brown?

201
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,281
-Yeah.

202
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,284
Greasy Toby,
the guy with the OCD?

203
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,755
-Yeah. That and ADD.

204
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,457
He tried to kiss me.

205
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,095
-He did?

206
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,697
-Mm-hmm.

207
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,799
Two days ago.

208
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,701
It's weird, it's like..

209
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,770
...this family friend
I've had for 12 years.

210
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:17,008
Just...he put his hands on my
face and tongue down my throat

211
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,712
and it was, was gross.
It was just bad.

212
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:25,116
-What, was it...gross because
you'd known him for so long

213
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,785
or...because he's gross?

214
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,289
-Mm...it was definitely him.

215
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,291
[chuckles]

216
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,329
You know how, like,
sometimes you've known someone

217
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,565
a really long time

218
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,735
and you just wanna kiss 'em just
to see if they're a good kisser?

219
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,441
-Yeah.

220
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,646
-I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

221
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,828
-Where are you going?

222
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,964
-Swimming.

223
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,933
[shrieks]

224
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,705
-Thought we were kissing!

225
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,040
-We were.

227
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,595
-Oh, shit.

228
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,604
Janny, I'm coming up
on your seven.

229
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,973
Fraggo!

230
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,308
Poof!

231
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,411
Aah! I think I just got
a team killed to save you guys.

232
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,213
It's all good, move it up!

...do you copy?

236
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,759
Agent36? Shit, they got him.

237
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,101
Shit, of course, now it's on.

Whoo!

God, that's most good.

00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,709
-Aah!

00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,046
-Oh, no! Oh, no.

243
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,052
Oh, no.

244
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,520
-You shot me!

245
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,089
-No fucking way.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, man.

246
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,691
I am so sorry!

247
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,728
-Help me!

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,063
-Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Don't come near me, man, okay?
Stay back.

00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,200
-Help me!
-Okay, okay, stay back.

251
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,169
-Ugh!
-Hey, stay back!

252
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,470

00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,940
I said stay back!

255
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,443
I'll get you some help,
just stay there!

256
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,178
Please!

257
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,516
Holy shit.

258
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,518
Fuck.

259
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,456
-Help me!

-Oh, my God.

263
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,480
What the...fuck?

264
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,286
Aah!

265
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:55,126
-Bert. Hey.

<i> Bert, come here! Come here.</i>

-<i> Holy shit.</i>

-What are you doing?

269
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,067
What, were you trying
to burn the whole place down?

270
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,369
<i> What's wrong with you?</i>

271
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,839
-What are you?
Smokey the Clown?

272
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,575
-You mean Smokey the Bear?

273
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,410
-Seriously though,
how old are you?

274
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,744
We can't leave you alone
for five minutes without

275
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,013
you burning the place down?

276
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:20,484
And he brought a gun. Great, so,
what were you shooting at?

277
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,421
-Squirrels.
I was shootin' some squirrels.

278
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,026
-Okay.
-What is wrong with him?

279
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,462
-<i> Video game</i>
<i> withdrawals maybe.</i>

280
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,977
-What are you gonna roast
on that thing?

281
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,612
-Squirrel, if we even get one.

282
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,713
-I'm a vegetarian.

283
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,349
[laughing]

284
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,988
-So, Paul, tell your story.

285
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,590
-No, no, man, it's..

286
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,159
It's too traumatic.
I don't want to talk about that.

287
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,694
-We like traumatic stories.

288
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,797
I mean, not about me,
but in general.

289
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,232
-Plus trauma bonds people

290
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,101
so you can totally
talk to us about it.

291
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,003
-Trauma bonds people
who experience it

292
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,170
not the people
that you tell the story --

293
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:16,040
-Just tell the story!
-Fine. Fine.

294
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,709
[laughing]

295
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:24,915
-We used to go to this
bowling alley

296
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,118
Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl,
you remember it?

297
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,687
-It was in Brighton, right?

298
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:33,257
-Yeah, that's why
it's called Brighton Bowl.

299
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,792
-Okay, guys.

300
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,994
-<i> Anyway, every weekend</i>
<i> I would go there either</i>

301
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:41,165
with my dad or for a birthday
party or whatever.

302
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,367
One weekend I asked my dad
if we were going?

303
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,703
He said, no.
He said the alley was closed.

304
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,841
Apparently,
some disgruntled employee

305
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:55,146
was holding all the other
employees at gunpoint.

306
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,415
<i> The police said that he tied</i>
<i> each hostage</i>

307
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:01,285
to a chair and arranged them
in a circle.

308
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:05,356
That way everyone was forced
to look at one another.

309
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,425
Then after that they've been
gagged and beaten

310
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,827
this maniac breaks out
a ball-peen hammer

311
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,929
and one by one..

312
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,000
<i> ...smashes in the back</i>
<i> of their heads.</i>

313
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,703
[laughs]

314
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,106
-Can you imagine
dying like that?

315
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,308
Just watching
all of your friends dying

316
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,743
knowing you're next?

317
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,977
-I can't.

318
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,080
-That's not all.

319
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,182
This guy doesn't stop,
he breaks out the fire axe.

320
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,751
The alarm sounds,
but he doesn't care.

321
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,219
He hacks off
all of their limbs

322
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,288
dismembers them completely.

323
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,156
When the police arrived

324
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,392
they just found
6 bloody torsos

325
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:44,061
tied to those colored
bowling chairs, remember?

326
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,098
Blood everywhere.

327
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,266
No sign of the killer though.

328
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,205
-And that was your childhood
playground?

329
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,843
-Yeah.

330
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,611
-True story.

331
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,684
-Oh, my God, you were lying?

332
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:09,253
-No, it's true..
You can look it up.

333
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,422
-You fuckers.
-It's not a funny story.

334
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:12,923
It's Jeff's face
that's making me laugh.

335
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,259
[gasps]
Shit!

336
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,495
-Where the fuck
did you come from?

337
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,532
-You spyin' on us?
-No, not at all.

338
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,169
Just saw your campfire.

339
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:29,106
I was out on a midnight hike, I
thought I'd come and say hello.

340
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,142
I haven't seen
anybody up here in a week.

341
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,710
-Um, can you do
something about--

342
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,946
-Dr. Mambo.
His name is Dr. Mambo.

343
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,481
At least that's what I call.

344
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,616
He seems to like it.

345
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:42,453
-Psychiatrist or pediatrician?

346
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,288
-Little of both, I guess.

347
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,424
-What are you doing out here?

348
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,926
-Same thing you guys are.

349
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,362
Enjoying nature.

350
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,498
Some of the best free climbing
is right here in this valley.

351
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,700
-I hate heights.

352
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,270
-It's definitely
not for everybody.

353
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,605
So you don't mind if I sit here
and chill out with you guys

354
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,873
for a bit, do you?

355
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,676
-Actually we're having
a private conversation

356
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,411
so if you don't mind..

357
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,614
-No worries.
I get it.

358
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,584
-I guess I'll just take
this big bag of weed

359
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,152
and smoke it all by myself.

360
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,022
-Oh, hey..
-No, no, no..

361
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,724
-Are you sure?
-Hey, no..

362
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,993
-I'm so sorry.
What's your name?

363
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,330
-Connor.
But you can call me Grim.

364
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,965
-Grim like, uh, Grimace or..

365
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,770
-No...just Grim.

366
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,808
Like that..

367
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,777
Like the Grim Reaper.

368
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,814
I figure I'm gonna die up
in these mountains anyway

369
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:48,519
so...I don't know..

370
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:51,288
Just a nickname.
I didn't beg it.

371
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,366
I just came up here
from Berkeley.

372
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,003
Now that's a party town.

373
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,306
-Karen was just there.
-Oh, yeah?

374
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,309
-Yeah.

375
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,145
Oh, my gosh,
I met these guys in..

376
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,714
<i> They won't let me drink</i>
<i> anything but beer</i>

377
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,550
<i> for, like, 5 days.</i>
<i> Just solid.</i>

378
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,253
-I've done that.

379
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,389
I got drunk.

380
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,725
-Actually, it sounds
like a pretty cool idea.

381
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,994
Only drinking beer.
-I could do it.

382
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,796
I don't know if you could.

383
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,666
-If that is a challenge, sir,
then I accept.

384
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,669
-Alright, fine,
from here on out,
we'll only drink beer.

385
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,105
-Deal.

386
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,640
[thunder rumbling]

387
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:47,011
-Looks like rain
is headed our way.

388
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,146
It's gonna be a wet one.

389
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:53,250
-Yeah. Party's over.

390
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,488
-Why don't you, uh, come up
for a minute and hang out?

391
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:01,759
-That's cool, but, uh,
I gotta get back to my tent.

392
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:04,328
I left all my gear out
and if it gets wet

393
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,764
that $4000 destroyed.

394
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,800
-<i> How far is your campsite?</i>

395
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,869
-It's about 20 minutes
give or take

396
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,904
but, uh, I'm coming back.

397
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,739
-Can you bring the weed?

398
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,740
-Absolutely.

399
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,908
[thunder rumbling]

400
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,844
-Alright, Dr. Mambo.
Let's hit it.

401
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,719
[chuckling]

402
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,054
-That was pretty weird.

403
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,022
-He was okay.

404
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,692
[thunder rumbling]

405
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,629
-So how did you do it?

406
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,298
[chuckles]

407
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,233
-What do you mean how?

408
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:47,071
It.. It was..

409
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:50,007
Okay, had different settings

410
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:55,212
like, pulse, power, stream

411
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,582
all different kinds of speeds
and, uh..

412
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:02,086
that was on this length of hose
that I could reach
when I lay down in the tub.

413
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,121
[Karen laughs]

414
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,390
-Wait, did you come
every time?

415
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,462
-Absolutely. Yeah.

416
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,530
Imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.

417
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,232
[laughs]

418
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,301
-Tell me about it.

419
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,137
-What's that supposed to mean?

420
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,271
-Wait, I have a better story.

421
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,641
-Bullshit, you do.

422
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,808
-Nothing beats stories
about Karen

423
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,876
and her parents shower massage.

424
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:26,877
-Thank you.

425
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:27,878
[knocking on door]

426
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,648
-Oh, it must be the weed guy.

427
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,750
Okay. Alright.

428
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,018
[knocking continues]

429

00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,555
-It's Grim.
-Yup, whatever.

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,193
-Help me.
-Oh, my God.

432
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,962
-I'm burnin'.

433
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,997
Help me.

434
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:49,900
I need a doctor.

435
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,036
-Uh, g -- get him a blanket.

436
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,737
-Oh, shit!

437
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,774
-You..

438
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,076
It's you.

439
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,511
-No, no, no, no, no.

440
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,514
No, no, no, no way

441
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,183
I'm letting that
contagious freak in.

442
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,519
-No, no, Bert, he's sick
and he needs help, okay?

443
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,754
-What? No, look at him.

444
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,890
I mean he's got something.
He's got something bad.

445
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,592
-But we need to call him
a doctor or call someone.

446
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,629
-Okay, no, no, no,
we don't have any receptions.

447
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,331
-Oh, shit, that freak
is going to the car.

448
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,533
-What?

449
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,567
-<i> Oh, wait, what?</i>
<i> What's he doing? What?</i>

450
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,403
-Oh, fuck!
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>

Hey! Get the fuck out.

Hey, get the fuck out

-Hey!
-Hey, freeze!

461
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,597
Look at me!
Look at the guy with the gun.

462
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,432
Hey, get out of the car.

463
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,669
-No! Shoot the crazy guy,
not the car.

464
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,472
-<i> Jeff, do something.</i>

465
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:04,041
-No, no, stay back,
stay back!

466
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,245
-Get the fuck..

00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,013
[screaming]

468
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,849
Go!

00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,387
Oh, my God.

00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,989
Help me.

00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,297
<i> I mean this guy,</i>
<i> he gets in the car</i>

I don't want him to touch me.

478
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,973
I don't want him to touch
any of us.

479
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,478
It was self-defense.

480
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,917
And it's raining,
so it probably put him out.

481
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,624
-This is some
serious real shit.

482
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:31,028
They are worse.

483
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,164
I mean, it looked like something
was eating his skin..

484
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,666
...like biohazard style.

485
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,203
Like quarantine.

486
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,171
-I think we should tell
the police it wasn't our fault.

487
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,476
We should tell them...now.

488
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,779
<i> We have -- we have to go</i>
<i> tell them right now. Please.</i>

489
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:52,583
-That's where the reality
comes in. We can't.

490
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,884
I'm not about to ride
in that car

491
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,252
with that dude's blood
all over it.

492

<i> Come on.</i>

493
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,027
Tomorrow we can clean it up,
fix the tire

494
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,765
whatever else is wrong with it,
and report the accident.

497
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,576
Holy shit.

[instrumental music]

499
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,056
-What's the plan?

500
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,760
-Divide and conquer.

501
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,263
-You better leave me
the rifle.

502
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,633
-He's right.

503
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,902
-What? Wait a second.

504
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,638
I'm not the one who went
ballistic last night.

505
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,106
-What's that supposed to mean?

506
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,143
-It means you raged
out of control, that's what.

507
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:27,577
-Well, that's fucked up.

508
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,446
-What was fucked up is you
beating the shit out of my car

509
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,014
with your fuckin' bat.

510
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,282
-What about Captain Jackoff
over here

511
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,684
with the assault rifle,
you forget about him?

512
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,420
-Alright, look,
we all fucked up the car.

513
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:39,957
-You guys are just gonna keep
arguing or maybe do somethin'
about it.

514
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,660
-Where you goin'?
-To get help.

-Jeff and Bert have --
-I know.

521
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,450
-I know you know it.

522
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:14,918
Look, last night, we --

523
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,355
-Paul, somebody came
to our door and asked for help

524
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,857
and we lit him on fire...okay.

525
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,293
He could be anywhere out there,
and I just wanna go home.

-Karen, it wasn't our fault.

527
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,131
We didn't mean to do it.
Everything happened so fast.

528
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,132
It was an accident.

529
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,768
-Was it?

530
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,539
I don't know about you,
but every time I close my eyes

531
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,108
I see him burning,
I can see him screaming

532
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,079
and his skin crackling and
the smell of his burning hair.

533
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,847
-We saw him when he came
on the door last night.

534
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,583
He was very sick.
He was going to die anyway.

535
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,351
-You don't know that.
Oh, my God.

536
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,922
-Look..

537
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:56,593
Look, I can't change
what happened last night.

538
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,896
I wish I could, but I can't.

539
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,668
But if we just work together
we can fix this.

540
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,239
Okay?

541
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,975
-Okay.
-Alright then.

542
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,980
Better?

543
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,782
-Yeah.

544
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,793
Thank you.
-Okay.

545
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,048
-I feel like, we're gonna get
lost.

546
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,617
-We're not gonna get lost.

547
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:02,092
[music continues]

548
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,471
That place
just gotta have a phone.

549
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,441
-Uh, yeah..

550
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,776
<i> It looks kinda creepy.</i>

551
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,647
-Don't be a wuss.
Let's go check it out.

552
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:26,650
[howling]

553
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,119
[intense music]

554
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:40,063
[woman grunting]

555
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,346
-God damn, rot!

556
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,052
You see this?

557
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,254
You see this shit?

558
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:08,425
This is the third sick hog
this month.

559
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:12,062
You tell Marie I can't eat this!

560
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,198
There's some goddamn animal
runnin' around here

561
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
infecting everything.

562
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:20,937
Now what am I supposed
to do with a sick hog, huh?

563
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,172
Huh?

564
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:25,008
I'm not about to eat this meat.
Would you?

565
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,445
-N -- no.
No, I -- I -- I'm a vegetarian.

566
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,547
-That has nothin'
to do with it

567
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:34,484
because you know
all this stuff is no good.

568
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:38,188
It's all sick.
It all has to go back.

569
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,360
I want me a new hog.

570
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,929
-Yeah, um,
we just need a mechanic

571
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,930
and we're just wondering --

572
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,532
-A mechanic?

573
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:50,867
You're not gonna find one here

574
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,369
you got to go into town
for that.

575
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,838
-Uh, yeah, right.

576
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,841
That -- that's the, um, ahem,
the problem.

577
00:37:57,843 --> 00:38:01,011
Our car is busted,
so we can't get into town.

578
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,445
We need someone
to take us to town

579
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,381
<i> to get a mechanic.</i>

580
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:07,917
-I already been in town
already today. Sorry.

581
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,123
-Uh, well, if you're going to
town again, can you let us know?

582
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,959
We're just stayin' at a cabin
a few miles down the road.

583
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,161
[intense music]

584
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,233
-I'm sorry.

585
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:26,336
Of course, of course.

586
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,206
Heck, why didn't you just come
right out with it?

587
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,176
Here I am pracklin' on
about my hog

588
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:37,814
and you just wanna find somebody
who's gonna find you a mechanic.

589
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,617
Come on up to the house.
I got a radio inside.

590
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,887
We'll call Ricky.
Uh, he's got a tow truck.

591
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,656
-That's actually great.
-Yeah, great.

592
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,958
-Thank you. Ricky.

593
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,831
[thunder rumbling]

594
00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:00,570
Sorry to bother you,
but we really appreciate this.

595
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,039
<i> Some crazy guy came out</i>
<i> of the woods</i>

596
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,676
just tryin' to trash our car
or break into it or somethin'.

597
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,178
-Sounds terrible.

598
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,913
Uh, you two wanted
somethin' to drink?

599
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:13,316
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, please, thank you.

600
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,053
-Uh, you said this person
damaged your car?

601
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,622
-Yeah, it was this crazy
hermit guy, like, really
dangerous.

602
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,459
We just scared him off with bats
and everythin'.

603
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:25,028
-Crazy hermit guy?
I --it wasn't Henry, was it?

604
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:29,132
[music continues]

605
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,602
-Um, Henry..
-No.

606
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:36,639
Uh, my Cousin Henry.
Uh, he knows better than that.

607
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,942
Did you say
you hit him with bats?

608
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,377
-No.
-No.

609
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,845
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

610
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,346
What he means is, uh, no.

611
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:46,549
It wasn't Henry,
it was our friend, Walter.

612
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,817
-It was Walter.
-<i> Our friend, Walter.</i>

613
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,086
This crazy friend Walter.
He's.. He was drunk.

614
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,788
-Oh, that's not good.

615
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,391
-Uh, y -- you know what?
Let's forget the tow truck.

616
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,292
It's turning into such a nice
day. We'll just walk.

617
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,961
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
we'll fix ourselves.

618
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:59,763
-Yeah.
-A -- are you sure?

619
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,698
-Yeah, absolutely.
Thank you so much.

620
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,932
-Thank you, really.

621
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,568
-Well, uh, suit yourselves,
I -- I..

622
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,807
-I can't believe
we burned Cousin Henry.

623
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,308
-I know.

624
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,181

[exhales sharply]

627
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,311
-Fuck. Did you find anybody?

628
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,749
-Nothing. Nobody's home.

629
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,385
-Place is locked up
pretty tight.

630
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,290
-Do you think the police
know about this yet?

631
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,459
-I doubt it.

632
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,394
If they did, they'd be
at the cabin already.

633
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,284
-Whoa, whoa! Easy, easy.

634
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:31,521
-Town boy, that's how people
get themselves shot around here.

635
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:39,963
-Deputy Winston, Bunyan County
Sheriff's Department.

636
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,498
-What can I do for you?

637
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,033
-I'm just out here on patrol.

638
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,969
It's my jurisdiction.

639
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:49,072
I understand you guys
had a little commotion here
last night.

640
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,841
I was hopin' you could tell me
somethin' about that.

641
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,979
-Sure, sure. Uh, some...guy
tried to enter our cabin.

642
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,515
Uh, he was sick, really sick.

643
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,016
I don't know
what kind of disease he had

644
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,218
but he was a mess, and..

645
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,823
-Yeah. Ahem.
I kinda have to report this.

646
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,027
-My friends are out lookin'
for a neighbor right now

647
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,863
so we could call you.
We don't have a phone up here.

648
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,066
-No, most people got radios.
That's what I've got.

649
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:25,375
It looks like you guys were
having some kinda party
last night, huh?

650
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,943
-Yeah, you know,
w-we were drinking

651
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,045
and then this guy came along
and tried to..

652
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,281
He tried to break
into our cabin, and, you know

653
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:32,749
uh, we had no choice,
but to get rough with him

654
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:33,750
and we didn't know what to do --

655
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,618
-Stop talkin'.
-Yes.

656
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,986
[chuckles]

657
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,088
-Look, man, I already told
you, makin' a report.

658
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,791
That guy isn't gonna come back
and bother you.

659
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,627
I'll bet you scared him off
pretty good, huh?

660
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,400
Besides...I won't let him
ruin the fun.

661
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:53,403
[intense music]

662
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,642
-Thanks
'cause...my friend's inside

663
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,911
and she's pretty upset
about the whole thing.

664
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,347
She wants to go home.

665
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:05,448
We all do.

666
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,918
-Mm, lady friend, huh?

667
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:12,922
-I'll bet you like to party.

668
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,291
I bet you like to party
with the ladies.

669
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,627
-Paul?

670
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,036
-Hey. Is everything okay?

671
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:29,839
-Oh, hey there, sugar.

672
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,676
Oh, everything is, uh,
it's just fine.

673
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,746
Why don't you take your
pretty little self back inside

674
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:41,985
just relax, put your feet up
and, uh, pop up another 40.

675
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,153
<i> It's all good.</i>
-Okay.

676
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,122
Ahem. Okay, then.

677
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:57,634
-Shit.

678
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:02,972
Now that girl is hot.

679
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,875
If you're askin' me,
you gotta stay and party.

680
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,846
-<i> Oh, you know,</i>
<i> that's why we came here</i>
<i> in the first place.</i>

681
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,082
-Yeah, boy..

00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:18,421
...ain't this some kind
of wonderful...shit?

683
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:22,291
<i> I'd say that creep really did</i>
<i> a number on your jeep here.</i>

684
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,927
-Do you think you can get
someone up here to fix it?

685
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,497
-Of course. I'm not an idiot.

686
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,599
I'll take care of you.

687
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,701
I could probably have
someone here by, uh

688
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:35,204
I don't know,
tomorrow afternoon?

689
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:37,807
I want you to know you're
in my top priority..

690
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,443
...'cause you're my party man..

691
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:44,213
...and this is party town.

692
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:45,882
We're all gonna party, right?

693
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,585
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

694
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:51,020
-Yeah.

695
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,355
-You know how to find me?

696
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,559
-Dial 911?

697
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,396
-That's right.

698
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,231
Yeah, that's right.

699
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,102
Take care of that little peach
in there.

700
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:08,271
She sure looks sweet.

00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:56,119
So is she gonna report it
or not report it?

707
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,855
-I don't think she is.

708
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:01,624
But she didn't make it sound
like we did anything wrong.

709
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,560
She said she'll have a tow truck
up here by tomorrow.

710
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,797
-Sounds...weird.

711
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,299
-It was.

712
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,770
-How's Karen? Has she come out
of her room yet?

713
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,271
-No, I think she's sleeping.

714
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:18,908
Dude, I don't know
what's up with her

715
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,078
but she wants to get out
of here as soon as possible.

716
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,114
-Well, that kinda screws up
your plan, doesn't it?

717
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,784
-What plan?

718
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,920
-Uh, the plan you're being
trying to execute since..

719
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,822
...what, 8th grade?

720
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,191
-There's no plan.

721
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:38,127
Not anymore.

722
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,466
-Alright.
Well, she's a head case anyway.

723
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,101
All chicks are.

724
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:47,870
-Why makes you say that?

725
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:49,372
-Look at her.

726
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:50,973
I mean, you like her
'cause she's nice to you

727
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,943
and she likes you
'cause she can control you.

728
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,845

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't, don't piss it off.

736
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:14,497
-Should I hit it?

737
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,966

you better hit it hard.

to shoot like that?

742
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,151
-I have 2 brothers.

743
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,487
Also you're not
the only gamer here.

Did you see how messed up
that dog was?

747
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:45,595
-Yeah.

748
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,296
So where's Grim?

-<i> I'll tell you where he is.</i>

751
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,007
He's out there rotting.

752
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:02,478
There's some shit in that woods.

753
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,513

spreading it around.

on the way out that we burned
some alive?

-Yes.
-No.

-Fine. Fuck it.

760
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:25,067
We'll tell them some sick guy
came by, so we set him on fire.

761
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,869
-They'll figure it out.

762
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:28,237
The deputy knows
something happened

763
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,373
we're the only outsiders here.

764
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,541
They'll trace it back to us.

get us out of here?

-Hey.
-Hey.

-No.

773
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,323
-Well, you should get back
to sleep.

00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:23,392
-Don't go.

-<i> Are you smaller doing</i>
<i> this now and not waiting?</i>

776
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:51,253
-Yeah, I could fix
the tire pretty quickly

777
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,556
but I still have no idea
what's wrong with the engine.

778
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,392
-Well, hurry up.

779
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,728

I can't do this by myself.

I can't handle anymore
of this shit!

I told you not to move her

I don't want
any of us to get sick

but you fucking idiots
insist on moving her

1019

and now you're covered
in her blood.

So the two of you can fucking
rot for all I care, alright?

"We're going down.
We're going down."

1035
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:57,599
And all you wanna do is just
grab the person next to you..

...and fuck the shit out of him.

1037

01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,520
I'll get you a ride.

1239
01:27:40,522 --> 01:27:43,090
-<i> Winston, Winston,</i>
<i> do you copy?</i>

1240
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:44,891
-I copy, sheriff,
go ahead.

1241
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:47,160
-<i> Some kids are up</i>
<i> in the cabin</i>
<i> apparently on some type</i>

1242
01:27:47,162 --> 01:27:49,696
<i> of killing spree.</i>
<i> Probably 3 casualties.</i>

1243
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:51,531
<i> They're armed and extremely</i>
<i> dangerous.</i>

1244
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:53,767
<i> I repeat, do not go</i>
<i> anywhere near them.</i>

1245
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:54,835
<i> They have some kind of</i>
<i> skin disease</i>

1246
01:27:54,837 --> 01:27:56,603
<i> that will eat you alive.</i>

1247
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:59,439
<i> So if you see them, don't</i>
<i> hesitate to shoot</i>
<i> them on site.</i>

1248
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,908
<i> Do you copy?</i>

1249
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,844
-Say that last part again.

1250
01:28:03,846 --> 01:28:06,780
-<i> I said if you see the kid,</i>
<i> shoot them on site.</i>

1251
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:12,085
-Copy that.

1252
01:28:12,087 --> 01:28:13,687
-You give me that ride,
Winston.

1253
01:28:13,689 --> 01:28:15,255
-Are you fucking nuts?
Shoot him.

1254
01:28:15,257 --> 01:28:16,857
-Shut up and back off.

1255
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:18,125
-I need that ride, Winston.

1256
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:19,726
-Stay back.
-Oh, Jesus.

1257
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:22,029
You did this?
-Stay back.

1258
01:28:22,031 --> 01:28:23,664
-Fuck you!
You did this.

1259
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:24,998
-Stay back.

1260
01:28:31,173 --> 01:28:32,873
[groaning]

1261
01:28:36,879 --> 01:28:40,080
-Great party, Winston.

1262
01:28:40,082 --> 01:28:42,549
-One more step,
I will kill you.

1263
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44,251
-You don't have to do that.

1264
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,422
-You heard the sheriff.

1265
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:52,526
-No one else has to die.

1266
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:56,129
-No one else has to fucking
die right now.

1267
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:59,933
You wanna fucking kill me?
Then fucking kill everyone.

1268
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:04,404
<i> No one else has to die.</i>

1269
01:29:04,406 --> 01:29:06,306
We're gonna make a deal.

1270
01:29:06,308 --> 01:29:09,242
This is what's gonna fucking
happen, you bitch.

1271
01:29:09,244 --> 01:29:12,946
You're gonna go look for me
at the cabin..

1272
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:14,848
...and I'm gonna go look
for a doctor.

1273
01:29:17,386 --> 01:29:19,353
Please!

1274
01:29:23,392 --> 01:29:25,292
-Oh, goddammit, party man.

1275
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:27,394
Alright.

1276
01:29:27,396 --> 01:29:30,030
I'm not gonna kill you.

1277
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,531
Take that path.

1278
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:33,033
It's a shortcut.

1279
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,302
It takes you straight
to the main road.

1280
01:29:35,304 --> 01:29:37,504
-Thank you, Winston.

1281
01:29:37,506 --> 01:29:40,006
Thank you.

1282
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:43,276
Don't touch anything
at the cabin.

1283
01:29:43,278 --> 01:29:44,945
It's all infected.

You fucking lied to me, Winston.

1290

There's no fucking
road out here!

1291
