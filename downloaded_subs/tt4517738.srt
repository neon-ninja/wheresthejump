<b>RESTORATION</b>

00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:42,785
<b>RESTORATION</b>

3
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,931
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

4
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,646
I've spoken with your family
and they're on their way.

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,182
They'll be here soon, John.

6
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,217
You're doing great.

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,784
Now let's talk about where
you're gonna vacation

8
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,687
after this?

9
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,322
What's your favorite place?

10
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,891
Are you a mountain man?

11
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,395
You like to go
camping and fishing?

12
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,462
Maybe a little cabin
with your girlfriend?

13
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,766
Because you're doing great.

14
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,203
Now where do you wanna go
when you get out of here?

15
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,437
How about New York City?

16
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:54,574
It's so magical there.

17
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:58,177
The Statue of Liberty,
Times Square, Broadway.

18
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,914
I'm a water baby myself.

19
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:03,549
Love the ocean.

20
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,483
You ever been to the Bahamas?

21
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,286
You'd love it, John.

22
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:08,554
Just love it.

23
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:12,357
Warm sun, the coronas
are cold and cheap.

24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,962
Come on, John.
Just hold on, okay?

25
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,431
Your parents are coming,
they're so close, I promise.

26
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:19,564
Just hang on.

27
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,900
John, just stay with me, okay?

28
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,234
Stay with me.

29
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,402
John, just stay with me.

30
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,570
You're gonna make it, John.

31
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:27,540
You are, I promise you.

32
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,909
You can do this, please, John.

33
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:31,978
Please.

34
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:35,948
John?

35
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:39,484
Jonathan.

36
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,596
John?

37
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,003
Dr. Jordan?

38
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,906
You need to call it.

39
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,317
Time of death, 3:15AM.

40
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,069
You can keep it if
you've lost yours.

41
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,006
I know how hard moving can be.

42
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,442
It wasn't for me, it was for
the patient, nurse Smything.

43
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,662
Great, honey.

44
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:30,762
Hey.
Hi.

45
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,397
You're home.

46
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,367
Are you okay?
Yeah.

47
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,103
Yeah?

48
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,737
Baby, these are our neighbors.

49
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,040
Harold and Francine Stone.

50
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,540
-Hi, I'm Rebecca.
-Nice to meet you.

51
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:43,908
-Hi.
-Hi.

52
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,076
And they
brought homemade cookies.

53
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:48,848
Not right now, thanks.

54
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,916
Homemade, that's
so kind of you.

55
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:55,019
Well, we're foodies so any
excuse to get in the kitchen

56
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:56,154
is a good one for Harold.

57
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:58,089
Hey, I earned that.

58
00:05:58,122 --> 00:06:00,058
Actually, Francine and I were
just talking the other day

59
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:02,161
about how we needed some new
blood in the neighborhood

60
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,764
so we'd love to have you
guys over for dinner.

61
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,165
Yeah, as soon as
the hospital gives her

62
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,567
some time to breathe,
we'd love that.

63
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,735
That's right.

64
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,536
Congratulations
on the residency.

65
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,406
It's a fantastic hospital.

66
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,908
Yeah, I feel pretty
lucky about it.

67
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,008
So, how does that work?

68
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,977
I mean, they just choose
where you go and you pack up

69
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,679
your life and move
there for four years?

70
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:22,947
'Cause that just sounds rough.

71
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,082
Um, well actually...

72
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,985
Just Google it, Harold.

73
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:27,852
The poor woman just
got off work, okay?

74
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:30,156
Let's just let her relax.

75
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,224
Sorry.

76
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,192
And we love your plans
for the house, by the way.

77
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,728
Very impressive.

78
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:38,463
Yeah, we're pretty
excited about it too.

79
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,800
It's a lot of work but
I think it'll be worth it.

80
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,135
And then we still have to
sort through all the belongings

81
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,038
from Mr. Vanderhorst.

82
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,774
My goodness, he had such an
odd assortment of things.

83
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,677
So he just walked away?

84
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,144
Did you know him?

85
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:54,846
-No.
-No.

86
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,016
I mean, I waved at him a
few times from the mail box

87
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,817
but that's it.

88
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,687
Well the brokers said that
his wife passed away recently?

89
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,823
And he just wanted to put
this house and his whole life

90
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,024
behind him, I guess.

91
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,959
So sad.

92
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,193
Not unusual, though.

93
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:11,162
I mean, statistically speaking,
men who outlive their wives

94
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:12,965
don't live very long.

95
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,235
And that's why you
have to live forever.

96
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,872
-Forever?
-Forever and ever.

97
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:23,074
Well, okay then.

98
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:26,979
Let's go, old man.

99
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,113
Yes, ma'am.

100
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:31,182
A hug. Okay, thank you.

101
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:34,487
Thanks so much for the
cookies and the teddy bear.

102
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,055
Teddy bear?

103
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,124
Nope, that's a actually
a gift from the house.

104
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:40,324
Yeah, I found it in the wall.

105
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:43,161
I thought it was a possum,
it scared the shit out of me.

106
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,197
Well, there's one more
for the collection then.

107
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,499
You collect teddy bears?

108
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:47,966
No.

109
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,170
But Mr. Vanderhorst
certainly did.

110
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:52,270
Yeah, a lot of 'em.

111
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:54,205
400 of them.

112
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:56,541
-Really?
-No shit.

113
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:57,909
You know, I've heard
that old teddy bears

114
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,677
can be worth a lot of money,
like there was one guy

115
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,013
on Craigslist who was...

116
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,213
Honey.

117
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,516
I'll Google it,
I'll Google it.

118
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:04,316
See you guys.

119
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,518
-Bye.
-Bye.

120
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,485
Bye.

121
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:11,524
Hi.

122
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,961
Internal damage.

123
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:19,732
The brain haemorrhage
was just too much.

124
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,735
I was really hoping that
he could see his family

125
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,703
before he passed.

126
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:28,240
They were 10 minutes out, Todd.

127
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,109
They were so close.

128
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:45,323
You know, maybe it's

129
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:48,293
a good thing that
they didn't make it.

130
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,229
That they didn't
see him that way.

131
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:51,796
You know?

132
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,331
Yeah.

133
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,171
I wanna be there for you,

134
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,973
and you for me in our
last moment of life.

135
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,585
I want it to just be us.

136
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,788
The last thing we see and know.

137
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:19,357
If you're last
thing that I see,

138
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,726
when I die,

139
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,995
then I'll be happy,

140
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,133
'cause then I know I'll
already be in heaven.

141
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,377
My god.

142
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:41,713
That is the best and worst
thing I've ever heard.

143
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:44,916
I hate you so much.

144
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,186
I love you so much.

145
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,927
God, you're so sweet.

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,162
You're so sweet, thank you.

147
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:00,065
The candles are so beautiful.

148
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,067
Just wait until I get
that gas line installed

149
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,369
for the fireplace.

150
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,671
Then whoosh.

151
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:06,604
As you wish, my lady.

152
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,907
God, you know
how I love it when you

153
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,676
spoil me with technology.

154
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,077
And fine cuisine.

155
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,814
Don't forget the hours I've
spent slaving over a hot phone.

156
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:19,918
Perish the
thought, master chef.

157
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:22,654
You belittle
me with your giggles.

158
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,389
You see, this is man's work.

159
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,890
You couldn't
possibly understand.

160
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:27,860
Really?

161
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,896
Me thinks you doth
protest too much.

162
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:33,365
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

163
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:36,301
Pardon me, ma'am,

164
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,904
but I think, I think
you've got some dry rot

165
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:43,307
in your timbers and
your transom.

166
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,909
Really?

167
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,446
Is that how you see me,
as this old house guy?

168
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,382
If the
shoe fits, partner.

169
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:54,318
Is that right?

170
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:55,721
Okay.

171
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,723
Well you know what
this calls for.

172
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:58,956
What?

173
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,125
Bear fight.

174
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,293
Come on!

175
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,461
Ho!

176
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,697
Yeah, butt first!

177
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,031
God!

178
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:07,699
Okay!

179
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:10,101
In the face!

180
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,703
Come on! Come on!

181
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:14,206
Don't be a
feared little fella!

182
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,709
I ain't gonna hurts ya!

183
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,277
I'm gonna get you!

184
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,817
Todd?

185
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,026
Todd?

186
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,764
God, you dick!

187
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,298
Baby, I'm
sorry, are you okay?

188
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,500
-Yes, I'm okay!
-I was just playing.

189
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,504
Well that bear isn't,
that shit is hard!

190
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,478
There's something
inside this.

191
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,522
Easy...

192
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:37,722
Easy...

193
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:41,259
My god, Todd, there's
definitely something in here.

194
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,538
Todd, it's a book.

195
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:56,040
It's a diary.

196
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,117
No no, you do the
honors, doctor.

197
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,019
Me?

198
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,153
Okay.

199
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,824
How do I...

200
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,261
Okay seriously, I mean...

201
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:19,063
Okay baby, I don't know how
you're ever gonna make surgeon

202
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:19,997
with a grip like that.

203
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,199
You are so fucking...

204
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,502
My god!
Hey, I got it.

205
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,470
No, it's small,
really it's nothing.

206
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:27,873
No, my kit's upstairs.

207
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,207
It just scared me.

208
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,509
No, I don't care.

209
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,577
These hands are worth
millions so we're gonna

210
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,846
get you upstairs, we're
gonna get you cleaned up.

211
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,347
And then you're going
to bed, young lady.

212
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,317
Yeah.
My big strong man.

213
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,053
I love it when you take
charge, you know that?

214
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:43,422
As you wish?

215
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,125
My
God, that's so bad.

216
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,605
Todd!

217
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,607
Todd, you let me
sleep in too late.

218
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,241
You looked too cute,
I didn't wanna wake you.

219
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,343
Really, you are
sch a sweet-talker.

220
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,544
True.

221
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:43,514
I'm seriously late.

222
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,017
Okay.
Coffee.

223
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,150
Coffee?

224
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:47,519
I only have time for one sip.

225
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,486
All right.

226
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,055
Yeah, that's good.

227
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,658
All right.

228
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,158
I gotta run.

229
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,094
Made you breakfast.

230
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:57,295
Really?

231
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,530
You are the best husband
ever, you know that?

232
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:00,598
I love you.

233
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,434
Go save lives!

234
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,682
Howdy, neighbor.

235
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,652
Hi, Harold!

236
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:48,332
What's up, doc?

237
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:50,068
You tell me.

238
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,169
Damnit.

239
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:26,171
Really?

240
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:27,672
At least
the breakers work.

241
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,574
God, Todd, fix it.

242
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:31,909
I got a better idea.

243
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,642
Sweety I had
the strangest...

244
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:13,711
Hey there, sleepy head.

245
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:14,979
Harold.

246
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:15,946
Francine.

247
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,847
Morning.

248
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,250
Hello.

249
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,418
Morning, gorgeous.

250
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:21,786
-Morning.
-Sleep okay?

251
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:22,988
Think so.

252
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,759
So you always make breakfast
for your neighbors?

253
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,026
Just the ones we like.

254
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,794
The others we burn at the stake.

255
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,696
You are horrible.

256
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,598
We were just on our
way home from the store

257
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:37,836
and we saw your big strong
man without his coffee mug.

258
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,471
So we thought we would
do our civil duty.

259
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,307
And make him fat, like me.

260
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:43,841
Seduced
by the dark side.

261
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,943
Honestly, I'm just
trying to bribe him

262
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:48,413
into giving me some free advice.

263
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:49,947
Francine's just my
coworker in crime.

264
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,884
Well, you
paid your dues.

265
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,051
Take your pound of flesh.

266
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,452
All right, our
plan worked, honey.

267
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,789
We are off to landscape town.

268
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,291
Love you, baby.

269
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,759
I love you.

270
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:09,967
I am sorry if we set you off.

271
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,070
No you've
been so welcoming.

272
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:14,838
Thank you.
You're sweet.

273
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:17,776
I'm not sure how I'd react to
another woman in my kitchen.

274
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:21,779
Especially so early in the
morning, but you are a dear.

275
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:26,483
We will get out of
your way, right away.

276
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:27,853
No need.

277
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,087
Okay then.

278
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,956
Well I promise to rein Harold in

279
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,991
and you just enjoy
your breakfast.

280
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:36,961
I said it was too early, but
when he saw Todd out there...

281
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,334
Harold just loves to
think he knows everything

282
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,567
about everything.

283
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,338
He will not call a plumber until
we're practically drowning.

284
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,374
Or an exterminator unless
we're overwhelmed by rats.

285
00:21:58,048 --> 00:21:59,651
Rebecca?

286
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,019
My god.

287
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:05,090
Are you okay?

288
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,991
Yeah,
I'm...

289
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:09,861
I'm okay, I'm just tired,

290
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:12,330
and the hours at the
hospital wear me out.

291
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:15,500
And my
cooking doesn't help.

292
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:16,867
I'm sorry.
No, no no.

293
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:20,404
It's not you,
really, it's just...

294
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:24,542
I'm stressed from work and the
house and the new hospital.

295
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:28,446
I understand,
more than you know.

296
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:31,883
What you need is a night out.

297
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,984
A girls' night.

298
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:36,019
Get your glow on.

299
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:57,975
World's biggest bird cage.

300
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,076
Glad I'm not cleaning it.

301
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,512
Right.

302
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,083
It seemed kind of odd it just
standing there all broken.

303
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:07,786
It'd make a great
park or something.

304
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,586
You'd have to talk
to the city about that.

305
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:12,790
They haven't been listening
for about 70 years.

306
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,592
I think they're waiting
on some big company

307
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,028
to make a bid and make
it worth their while.

308
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,430
Then all our property
values go up.

309
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:22,200
Anyway, there's this
pond I'm gonna rehab.

310
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:24,067
Based on the foliage it
looks like they set up

311
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,104
some sort of English garden.

312
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,105
What?

313
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,105
English garden?

314
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:30,474
No, that was their burn barrel.

315
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,710
They got rid of their
garbage in that hole.

316
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:33,577
Really?

317
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:35,180
Like, what, leaves?

318
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:39,017
Trash and plastic, whatever
they want to get rid of.

319
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:40,951
There were no recycling
bins back then, just,

320
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,653
fire and smoke.

321
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,822
You scratch the surface
we're all just an inch

322
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:46,525
above the dark ages.

323
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:51,695
Yeah, I guess I'm
romanticizing it a bit?

324
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,064
You should.

325
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,798
It's your house.

326
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:56,034
Your home.

327
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,602
Fall in love.

328
00:23:58,869 --> 00:23:59,971
No no, I'm good.

329
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,505
Those will kill you.

330
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:03,674
Truth, but if you're
already in the train,

331
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,044
you might as well
enjoy the ride.

332
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:07,945
What does that mean?

333
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,113
Lung cancer.

334
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:11,849
Got the eviction
notice four months ago.

335
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,518
Shit, I'm sorry.

336
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,454
Harold, I didn't mean
to make a joke about it.

337
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,490
Don't apologize.

338
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,158
Nobody lives forever.

339
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:33,170
God, longest seconds ever.

340
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:48,953
Okay.

341
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,898
What the hell does this mean?

342
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,179
Come on.

343
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,755
Come on.

344
00:25:51,348 --> 00:25:52,283
Hey, baby?

345
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,152
I got the washer nuts
for the tub faucet.

346
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:55,653
Can I get in there?
Yeah, okay.

347
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,020
Um...

348
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:58,022
Okay.

349
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,458
Give me a second.
I really gotta pee.

350
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:01,826
All right, just
give me a minute.

351
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,160
I'll be right out.

352
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:04,295
All right, hang on!
I really gotta pee!

353
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:06,196
Yeah, one minute,
I know, I know.

354
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,365
I'll be right out.

355
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:25,216
You scared me.

356
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:28,685
The shank came
off, and the knob.

357
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,153
Yeah.

358
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:31,321
You all right?
Yeah.

359
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:32,856
Okay, just give me
a few minutes, all right?

360
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,258
Okay, yeah yeah.

361
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,192
Get out.

362
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,194
See you in a few, thanks baby.

363
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,729
-Okay.
-Okay.

364
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,366
Hey hey.

365
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,835
Hey, how's the faucet?

366
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,235
It's perfect. Easy fix.

367
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:46,637
Good.

368
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,038
How you feelin'?

369
00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:49,840
Good. I'm just
tired, you know?

370
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,143
You seemed a
little sick after breakfast.

371
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:55,012
Yeah, too
much greasy bacon.

372
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,016
Maybe you just got the
flu from work or something.

373
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:00,818
Um, no it's not the flu.

374
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:09,661
Is there anything else
that you think it might be?

375
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:16,701
I dropped my wrench
in the trash.

376
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,773
Todd, I was just gonna...

377
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,974
I was gonna tell you.

378
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:27,412
I just needed to figure
out how to tell you.

379
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:29,212
How to tell me.

380
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,884
Baby, we're a team.

381
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,252
I just wasn't thinking.

382
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,955
You hid this in the garbage.

383
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:40,024
I mean, I'm sorry but
that is fucked up, honey.

384
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,425
Okay, you know what?

385
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,061
I don't wanna get into
an argument about this.

386
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,429
So let's just talk
about this later.

387
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,029
We're gonna talk
about this right now.

388
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:47,732
How long have you known?
I just told you!

389
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:48,900
I found out just now!

390
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:51,201
Rebecca, you are a doctor!

391
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,370
Of medicine!

392
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:55,173
How long have you known?

393
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:57,741
I didn't wanna say anything
until I was sure, okay?

394
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,444
Okay, I appreciate
that. Thank you.

395
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,978
I really do, I understand that,

396
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,747
but don't fuckin' protect
me from our lives.

397
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,715
God, why are you
getting so angry?

398
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,951
I'm not angry,
I'm intense, okay?

399
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:08,218
Intense.

400
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,753
Involved.

401
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:13,057
This is supposed
to be our decision.

402
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:15,693
What is that supposed to mean?

403
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:20,864
I wanted to have
a kid with you.

404
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:21,832
When we are ready.

405
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,734
So you're not ready now?

406
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:24,702
Don't play that game with me.

407
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,505
You know that I wanna
have kids with you.

408
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:30,474
I just also wanna
have you with you.

409
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,076
And the last five
years have been...

410
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:33,944
Past five years, Todd?

411
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,145
What, what?

412
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,248
Tell me about the
past five years, what?

413
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,983
The last five years have
been about supporting you.

414
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,086
School, studying, the residency.

415
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:45,055
It's all been about you
becoming the doctor you wanna be

416
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:48,058
and that's okay,
I understand that!

417
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:51,496
Well I'm so
sorry that you were

418
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,498
really fucking supportive, okay?

419
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,432
-Don't!
-God!

420
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:55,766
Hey, this is us!

421
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,768
All right?

422
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,535
Us.

423
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:01,271
And I just wanted to have
some time being together.

424
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:03,074
Creating a life together.

425
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:06,109
Spoiling you with no
fucking responsibilities.

426
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,377
Just us, all right?

427
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:10,047
I wanted to have
a fucking choice.

428
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,783
I didn't plan this.

429
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,519
And you know what?
I'm not sorry.

430
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,889
But I am sorry that
you're not happy.

431
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,791
I'm fucking ecstatic!

432
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,059
I fucking love you!

433
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,230
And I wanna have kids with
you, it's just this is...

434
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,567
Fuck this is a lot!

435
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:34,138
You know? It's a fucking lot!

436
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,506
Fuck!

437
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:52,557
Cheers to you, buddy.

438
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,507
There you go.

439
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,115
I'm gonna be daddy.

440
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:26,671
Becca?

441
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,115
Dear diary.

442
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,250
Today is my 11th birthday.

443
00:34:13,282 --> 00:34:16,386
I wanted a doggy so we
could adventure together,

444
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,222
but Daddy said I wasn't
responsible enough.

445
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:22,225
So, instead I got
you, Dear Diary,

446
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:23,793
and a rad new bike.

447
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:27,131
So I guess you could say
that I'm a pretty lucky girl.

448
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,099
Dear diary.

449
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,867
Today new people moved
in down the street.

450
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,203
A family with a boy
and girl my age.

451
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,139
The girl's named Delia
and the boy is Robert.

452
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:38,208
He says they're adopted, but,

453
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,211
they don't look adopted to me.

454
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,847
He says that he's gonna be
a New York Yankee one day.

455
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,282
I think I like him.

456
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:49,686
I gave Delia Mr. Tickles
'cause she likes him so much

457
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,754
and maybe Daddy will think
I'm responsible enough

458
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,891
to have a puppy for
my next birthday,

459
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:56,527
if I don't have little kid toys.

460
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,362
But, I miss him already.

461
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,465
Dear diary.

462
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:04,367
Robbie's mom got super-mad
that we were playing

463
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,236
explorers in the
meadow and said that

464
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:08,838
I could have gotten them
hurt with my stupidity.

465
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:11,841
I'm not stupid.

466
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,710
They are stupid.

467
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,746
They don't even let Delia
and Robbie go to school

468
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:16,914
like me.

469
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,749
It's not fair.

470
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:21,184
I hope their butts fall off.

471
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,438
Dear diary.

472
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:43,641
A girl from my school
got disappeared,

473
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:45,476
and nobody found her.

474
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,577
Her mom came into the school.

475
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,947
She doesn't have a dad
'cause she's a latchkey kid.

476
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:52,883
Principle Clark talked
to us in the gym

477
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,852
about stranger danger.

478
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:57,454
Back in class, Miss
B. told us to go home

479
00:35:57,487 --> 00:36:00,356
holding hands with
our safety partners.

480
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:03,193
I feel sad, even though
I didn't know her.

481
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:04,327
Dear diary.

482
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,231
Robbie told me his new mom
and dad keep secret stuff

483
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:09,766
down in the basement.

484
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,371
So we're gonna investigate
like Nancy Drew.

485
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:13,596
We looked into the basement.

486
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,599
It was all dark, but
then I saw something move

487
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:18,268
and I heard a song.

488
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,304
I can't remember what I saw.

489
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:22,905
It's like my head
doesn't want to.

490
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:26,042
But the song, I kept
on hearing the song.

491
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:29,280
It was like a church
song, but mad.

492
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,315
It was so mad.

493
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,853
You okay?

494
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:37,855
Why do you have a weapon?

495
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,860
I heard something and...

496
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,932
So you brought that?

497
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,033
Yeah.

498
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:53,303
There was a shadow and then
there's a noise so I...

499
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:55,039
Yeah.

500
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,842
Todd.

501
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,646
I'm sorry.

502
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,291
I'm so sorry.

503
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:17,327
I should have told you when
I even first suspected.

504
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,364
I just couldn't bear
to get my hopes up.

505
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:49,092
Todd, I love you so much.

506
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:53,030
We're having a baby.

507
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,413
Go save lives.

508
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,882
-Love you.
-I know.

509
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:31,501
Son of a bitch.

510
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:34,003
That's it.

511
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,746
All right.

512
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,928
It's a brownout?

513
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,668
We paid the bills
so why is this...

514
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,204
Come on.

515
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,110
Okay.

516
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:48,445
I got this.

517
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:50,881
Let's see.

518
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:53,884
That's the wall.

519
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:56,018
That's the front yard.

520
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,655
That's the...

521
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:01,157
Water heater.

522
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:05,128
All right.

523
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:08,498
Shit.

524
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,682
Come on!

525
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,519
Hello?

526
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,821
What are you doing down here?

527
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,563
It burns.

528
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:42,032
It's okay.

529
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,800
I didn't mean to scare you.

530
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:47,204
It's okay.

531
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,572
What's your name?

532
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:52,009
It's okay.

533
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:55,611
What's your name?

534
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,847
Why don't we find your parents?

535
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,286
It burns.

536
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:21,838
Okay, he's stable
but he can't sleep

537
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:23,574
for another four hours,
so make sure you keep

538
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:24,740
him in your line of sight.

539
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:26,242
Get him food, walk him around.

540
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,911
Yes, exactly.

541
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:29,246
Compound fracture in 1A?

542
00:42:29,278 --> 00:42:31,815
X-ray is done, no
internal lacerations,

543
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:34,750
bleeding's stopped, ready
for reset within the hour.

544
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:35,652
Good.

545
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:37,353
Thank you.

546
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,956
Okay, what's next?

547
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,090
Grab a Red Bull.

548
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:42,192
You've got a long night.

549
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:44,894
Dr. Jordan, we have a
second-degree-burn victim.

550
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:46,963
Just came in. Might
be self-inflicted.

551
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:49,031
Okay, who's doing
triage? What room is he in?

552
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:50,267
1C, he's prepped and stable.

553
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,768
Sedatives? Painkillers?

554
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,069
Morphine and narcex.

555
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,338
Just give me a moment,
okay? I need to check...

556
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,173
No, Dr. Jordan.

557
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,307
It's your husband.

558
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:02,346
My god.

559
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,181
Todd, what happened?

560
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:05,648
How did you...

561
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,353
A girl, she...

562
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,722
She was on fire.

563
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:15,358
And grabbed me.

564
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:18,327
She grabbed me.

565
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,128
What?

566
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:20,864
What, Todd? Look
at me, sweetheart.

567
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:23,065
Okay? Focus, and I
need you to tell me.

568
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,735
What happened?

569
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,137
She was on fire.

570
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:30,840
From the inside.

571
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:39,216
Okay.

572
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:41,350
Okay, all right.

573
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:44,088
I'm gonna look at this, okay?

574
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,802
How is he?

575
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:02,238
-Harold?
-I called 911.

576
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:05,074
I heard him screaming when I
was outside having a smoke.

577
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:07,010
I thought your house
was gonna burn down.

578
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:08,045
What?

579
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:09,846
Harold, what happened to him?

580
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:12,214
He came stumbling
down the stairs,

581
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:14,150
holding his arms
out in front of him.

582
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,053
I tried to help but
he was so out of it,

583
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:19,689
so I called and came over
with the ambulance and...

584
00:44:19,722 --> 00:44:21,023
Sir, this is for family only.

585
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:22,224
You need to be in the lobby.

586
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:23,225
No no, he's fine.

587
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:25,327
It's okay.

588
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,461
You stay here.

589
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:29,733
I'll take care of the
paperwork, you take care of him.

590
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,268
Thank you.

591
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:38,208
Okay, let's lay you down here.

592
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,443
Okay, sweetheart?

593
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,711
There you go.

594
00:44:41,744 --> 00:44:42,913
Just like that.

595
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:44,980
-The girl.
-Todd.

596
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:46,750
It's okay.

597
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:47,717
She was...

598
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:52,422
It's okay.

599
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:53,456
From the inside.

600
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:55,491
Okay.

601
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:57,094
It's okay.

602
00:45:01,396 --> 00:45:02,498
Dear diary.

603
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:04,434
Susie Mortez is missing.

604
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:07,304
She went to a different
school than me.

605
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:09,773
Now I have to stay in the yard.

606
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:12,442
No more adventures
with Robbie and Delia.

607
00:45:12,474 --> 00:45:14,877
They waved at me
from their yard,

608
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,913
but their mom called
them back inside

609
00:45:16,945 --> 00:45:19,215
like I did something bad.

610
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:23,953
Dear diary.

611
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,523
The police took
Robbie's dad today.

612
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:29,992
He had blood on him and
yelled at the policemen.

613
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:32,795
Robbie and Delia
wouldn't talk to me.

614
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:34,331
Their mom was crying.

615
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,465
I've never seen a mom cry.

616
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:39,435
She ran up to me and
gave me Mr. Tickles,

617
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:43,373
then Robbie and Delia took her
inside, like she was a kid.

618
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:44,840
Dear Diary.

619
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:46,909
Dad said he took the
disappeared girls.

620
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:50,180
That's why the policemen
took Robbie's dad away.

621
00:45:51,947 --> 00:45:53,250
Dear diary.

622
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,251
I saw Robbie and Delia.

623
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:57,286
They were outside my room.

624
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,322
Dad said no one was there,

625
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:00,824
but they were.

626
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:02,492
They were there.

627
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:05,128
I don't wanna get disappeared.

628
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,198
Dear diary.

629
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:10,801
Mom and Dad won't listen.

630
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,835
Maybe it's better.

631
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:17,073
I don't want Robbie and Delia
to hurt them 'cause of me.

632
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,476
I'm scared.

633
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,378
I don't wanna get disappeared.

634
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:26,415
But if I do, I know
you won't forget me.

635
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:29,286
You can remember me if I'm gone.

636
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:16,932
I think that the last
time that I saw you I

637
00:47:16,965 --> 00:47:21,538
said some things that
seemed a little crazy

638
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,339
but it's not me.

639
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:31,148
It's not me.

640
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:38,654
Look, I know that you're a
doctor and people come in

641
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:40,289
and say crazy shit all the time.

642
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:41,625
I believe you.

643
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:45,262
What?

644
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:54,605
I believe you about the girl.

645
00:47:57,673 --> 00:47:59,543
She was on fire.

646
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,880
Yeah, she was on fire.

647
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:05,448
Where did you...

648
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:07,484
I saw her in the house.

649
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:16,959
I think I know who she is, Todd.

650
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:18,094
How?

651
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:19,663
How could you?

652
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:25,035
She's that girl
from the diary.

653
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:29,405
Something happened to her.

654
00:48:29,438 --> 00:48:33,143
Todd, something really bad
happened to that little girl.

655
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:37,079
Hey, are you okay?

656
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:38,948
Yeah?
Yeah.

657
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:53,630
We have dinner tonight
with Harold and Francine.

658
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:57,067
It's like a welcome
home dinner, okay?

659
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:58,101
Yeah.

660
00:48:58,134 --> 00:48:59,936
That sounds good.

661
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,675
I don't know what I would
have done without him.

662
00:49:08,043 --> 00:49:09,679
So what are we gonna do,

663
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:12,682
about this fire child?

664
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:19,455
I got this
from nurse Smything.

665
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,157
I'm gonna check the hospital
records later tonight

666
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,626
when it's just
the skeleton crew.

667
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:26,363
What?
How?

668
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,499
Her name is on the front
cover of the journal.

669
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:35,704
That was delicious.

670
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:37,306
-Yes.
-Thank you.

671
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,775
Only the best for us.

672
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:41,677
We have an organic
butcher in Valley Village.

673
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,112
Local-grown.

674
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,614
I'll have to borrow him.

675
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:46,782
Do you want me to put
the salad in the fridge?

676
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:48,384
Relax.

677
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,519
You open another bottle of wine.

678
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:52,556
We've got this.
Okay.

679
00:49:58,293 --> 00:49:59,728
Women.

680
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:02,766
The more the world changes,
the more they stay the same.

681
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:04,800
Yeah, don't let Rebecca
hear you say that.

682
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:09,638
I think the spirits
have made me fearless.

683
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:14,477
I thought we were gonna
light it up together.

684
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,513
Get my Frenchy going.

685
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,181
One's my limit.

686
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:20,150
You mean, half.

687
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,754
I'm watching my figure.

688
00:50:24,786 --> 00:50:27,189
For the both of you?

689
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:28,491
Really?

690
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:33,328
How did you know?

691
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:35,731
My cooking's not that bad.

692
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:43,505
That's quite
the bottle opener.

693
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,442
Our illustrious patron.

694
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:48,644
Allow me to introduce you
to Lieutenant Colonel James

695
00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:50,746
Smyth Burget.

696
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,117
First Baronet of
Easton and the director

697
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,219
of the East India
Trading Company.

698
00:50:56,251 --> 00:51:00,123
The spring from whence all
our riches bubble forth.

699
00:51:00,155 --> 00:51:01,123
Really?

700
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:02,192
Grandpa?

701
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:04,793
Um, many greats, but yes.

702
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:06,196
Sounds great.

703
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:08,431
Actually, he didn't
start that way.

704
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:12,134
He was volunteered into
the East India Army's

705
00:51:12,168 --> 00:51:14,604
foreign cavalry where
apparently he was rather adept

706
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:17,774
at um, "converting the savages."

707
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:20,809
New world term for
old world massacre.

708
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,514
Promoted to Lieutenant
Colonel, given a directorship

709
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:26,682
in the company with shares.

710
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:30,152
Kinda like buying a stock
in Apple Computers in 1976.

711
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:30,854
Exactly.

712
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,590
So you're a baron.

713
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:35,791
No.

714
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:38,560
The title died with him,
but the shares gave birth

715
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:41,865
to a family of ne'-do-wells
that continue to this day.

716
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,867
And of course the
nouveau riche always settle

717
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,168
in the suburban neighborhoods.

718
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,439
We prefer to call it "mingling
with the lower classes"

719
00:51:49,472 --> 00:51:53,243
purely subterfuge for
our nefarious plots.

720
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:55,844
It's not the golden
ticket people imagine,

721
00:51:55,878 --> 00:51:58,481
but it does allow us to travel

722
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:00,849
and pursue alternative
cancer treatments

723
00:52:00,882 --> 00:52:02,885
whilst keeping a roof over
our heads and for that

724
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:06,355
I'll always be eternally
grateful to the old man.

725
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,925
Sounds like a hell of a guy.

726
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:12,929
The Maharaj called
him Burget, "the beast."

727
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:15,297
So you've got the
location right.

728
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,568
More ancestors?

729
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:23,438
August and Drusilla.

730
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:26,143
Apples from the poison tree.

731
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:30,746
Great year.

732
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,515
Yeah?

733
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:34,216
You sure?

734
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,787
Definitely.

735
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,323
You and Harold have children?

736
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:41,858
Didn't stick.

737
00:52:46,262 --> 00:52:49,966
You two are just
great together.

738
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:53,535
A lot of people your age
don't have kids nowadays.

739
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:55,337
My age?

740
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:58,208
You have no idea.

741
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,478
I just meant that you both
seem really happy together.

742
00:53:13,588 --> 00:53:16,625
Every day, it's like
I won the lottery.

743
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:18,195
Every day.

744
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:23,699
Um, Francine
your blouse is wet.

745
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:27,469
Might wanna...

746
00:53:32,307 --> 00:53:33,976
Let it dry.

747
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:39,015
Lighten up, doc.

748
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:42,651
You've got plenty of wardrobe
malfunctions coming your way.

749
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:50,960
What do you mean?

750
00:53:50,992 --> 00:53:52,461
A breast-feeding mother

751
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:54,663
will lactate at the
sound of a baby.

752
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:56,266
Just the sound.

753
00:53:56,298 --> 00:53:59,369
Even if you're not aware
of it, your body is.

754
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,938
And it behaves as if it
doesn't even belong to you.

755
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,615
Thank you.

756
00:54:13,648 --> 00:54:14,951
Any time.

757
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:18,020
I hope not.

758
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:21,858
You don't have to thank me.

759
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,326
Yes we do.

760
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,763
He only did what any
good neighbor would do.

761
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,632
Yes but it was you.

762
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,635
Do you remember much?

763
00:54:33,668 --> 00:54:36,038
No, not really.

764
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,641
I remember being in
the basement and,

765
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:42,012
then I remember your face as
I went into the ambulance.

766
00:54:44,713 --> 00:54:46,482
"She's on fire."

767
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:52,289
That's what you kept on saying.

768
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,592
"She's on fire."

769
00:54:58,494 --> 00:55:01,564
I, um...

770
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:05,468
I saw something when
I went down there.

771
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,903
And it burnt me.

772
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,938
Old wires.

773
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:10,539
No.

774
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:12,674
It was a girl.

775
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,778
It was a little girl
screaming, on fire.

776
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:17,814
We've both seen her.

777
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:20,750
You got off lucky.

778
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:22,018
I'm not sure.

779
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,853
We found a diary in the walls.

780
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:25,121
It's a little girl's diary.

781
00:55:25,153 --> 00:55:27,123
Yeah, Rebecca thinks
that the little girl...

782
00:55:27,155 --> 00:55:28,056
Katie, her name's Katie.

783
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:31,327
Katie is the little
girl in the diary.

784
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:35,131
Rebecca thinks that
she's the one that...

785
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:37,734
Set you on fire.

786
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:39,335
Yeah.

787
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,407
I've seen her myself.

788
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,411
In dreams and in waking life.

789
00:55:48,443 --> 00:55:50,646
This is something that I
never imagined believing

790
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:53,048
from somebody else but,

791
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:55,650
it's true.

792
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:58,454
I've felt it.

793
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:00,722
I've felt her.

794
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:03,525
Do you know the history
of this neighborhood?

795
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,896
Anything that would make
this crazy shit make sense.

796
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,431
Well.

797
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:16,972
The average house
price is going up 12.7%

798
00:56:17,005 --> 00:56:19,107
but that's what my real
estate agent told me

799
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:21,677
when we bought the place so,

800
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,847
flaming girls weren't really
a sell point.

801
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,449
I'm sorry, guys.

802
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:29,085
No, I guess so.

803
00:56:29,117 --> 00:56:31,420
Who
wants creme brulee?

804
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:06,688
You gotta be kidding.

805
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,660
My god.

806
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:14,931
Okay.

807
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:17,467
Get it together, Becks, come on.

808
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,235
All right.

809
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:20,769
All right.

810
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,873
Vanderhorst,
Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst.

811
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:27,109
Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst.

812
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:28,877
V, V, V, V, Vanderhorst.

813
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:31,547
Come on.

814
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,085
Really?

815
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:43,759
There we go.

816
00:57:46,795 --> 00:57:48,164
V.

817
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:49,499
V for Vanderhorst.

818
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,800
Vanderhorst.

819
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,201
Okay.

820
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:53,235
All right.

821
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:55,570
V, V, V, where are you?

822
00:57:55,603 --> 00:57:58,573
Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst,
Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst.

823
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:20,763
Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst.

824
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:22,564
Where are you?

825
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,535
Vanderhorst.

826
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:28,570
Vanderhorst!

827
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:30,005
Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst.

828
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,081
Jesus.

829
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,084
Todd?

830
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:43,252
Hello?

831
00:58:43,284 --> 00:58:44,686
-Sweety?
-Rebecca.

832
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:46,321
Rebecca, hello?
Todd.

833
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:48,291
Can you hear me? The
reception's kind of shaky.

834
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,192
I'm down in the basement.

835
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:51,594
Yeah, okay.

836
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:53,128
Listen, there's
nothing on her file.

837
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:56,064
It just stops as if she
transferred hospitals.

838
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,967
That's because
she went missing.

839
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:00,135
What?

840
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:04,072
Honey, look for a
file on Linda Cruthers.

841
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:05,241
Who is she?

842
00:59:05,273 --> 00:59:07,009
She's her alleged kidnapper.

843
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:08,577
She was sent to a
sanitarium nearby.

844
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,946
She might still be alive.

845
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,347
Todd, what?

846
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,348
What?

847
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:14,650
Hello?

848
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,319
Honey.

849
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:19,655
Damnit.

850
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,360
Okay.

851
00:59:24,393 --> 00:59:26,362
Cruthers.

852
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:30,733
Cruthers.

853
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,974
I don't understand.

854
00:59:42,311 --> 00:59:43,879
Why isn't it here?

855
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:08,704
Shit.

856
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,056
Linda Cruthers.

857
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,659
Hello?
Health Institute.

858
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,059
How may I help you?

859
01:00:31,092 --> 01:00:33,663
Hi, this is
Rebecca Jordan from Seeders.

860
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:36,431
Isn't Linda Cruthers still
a patient at your facility?

861
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:38,334
What is this
in regards to, please?

862
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:39,669
I was
hoping to visit her.

863
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,137
Ask her some questions?

864
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,271
Are
you a family member?

865
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:43,271
No, but...

866
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:45,707
I'm sorry,
we don't allow visitors.

867
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,242
My residency
is in neurology.

868
01:00:47,275 --> 01:00:50,145
I was hoping to do a
medical evaluation of her.

869
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,148
Has this been
cleared by your supervisor?

870
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:55,117
Yes. They believe
she's a perfect candidate.

871
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,385
Be here at 9AM.

872
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,287
Parking is in the
north-east corner.

873
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,023
Bring all necessary
paperwork and credentials.

874
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:02,858
Excuse me, can
you tell me where...

875
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:06,195
Okay?

876
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,365
You ready?

877
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:14,135
Help me!

878
01:01:18,005 --> 01:01:19,375
May I help you?

879
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:22,711
Um yes, we're here
to see Linda Cruthers.

880
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,414
You called earlier?

881
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:27,817
Yes.

882
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:29,719
Credentials?

883
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:38,093
That's good, doctor.

884
01:01:38,126 --> 01:01:40,262
I'm sure she'll be
real happy to see you.

885
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:41,731
Really?

886
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:42,798
Yeah.

887
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:44,500
No one's ever been to
see her but her children.

888
01:01:44,532 --> 01:01:45,967
Not since I've been here.

889
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:47,870
When was the last
time they visited?

890
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:50,907
A few days ago.

891
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:53,909
Sign in, please.

892
01:02:00,815 --> 01:02:01,916
You'll need these.

893
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:03,818
Thank you.

894
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:05,754
I'll take you.

895
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:33,348
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

896
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:34,983
Thank you.

897
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,394
Mrs. Cruthers.

898
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:49,298
We need to talk to you.

899
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:05,447
I know it's been
a very long time,

900
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,018
but we need you to help us
find Katherine Vanderhorst.

901
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,786
Or at least her remains.

902
01:03:17,525 --> 01:03:20,862
Mrs. Cruthers, you were the
last person to see her alive.

903
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:23,332
She wrote about
you in her diary.

904
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,135
Please.

905
01:03:27,168 --> 01:03:28,871
Help us.

906
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:30,539
Do the right thing
and make this right.

907
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:33,342
You destroyed lives,

908
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:36,177
families, with what you did.

909
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,346
Try to make it right,
before you die.

910
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,414
-Todd.
-No, no.

911
01:03:39,447 --> 01:03:41,916
This woman is responsible
for some terrible shit.

912
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:43,384
This is her one chance.

913
01:03:43,418 --> 01:03:45,086
Clinically
insane, Todd.

914
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,521
She's not responsible.
No.

915
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:48,089
I can't buy that, Becca.

916
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:50,059
Not with what we've seen.

917
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,240
This is a waste of time.

918
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:05,842
Let's go.

919
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:18,855
Mr. Tickles.

920
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:36,905
Mr. Tickles.

921
01:04:37,972 --> 01:04:39,574
Did you say something?

922
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:42,544
I missed you so
bad, Mr. Tickles.

923
01:04:42,577 --> 01:04:45,180
Did you give Katie
the teddy bear?

924
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:48,484
Katie gave him to me.

925
01:04:49,384 --> 01:04:51,152
For keeps.

926
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:52,655
No escapees.

927
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:57,526
So Katie gave you the bear.

928
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,128
Katie did.

929
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:03,932
Katie was Nancy Drew.

930
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,604
Me and Robbie,

931
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:13,342
were Bess and George.

932
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:18,414
We played adventures.

933
01:05:19,681 --> 01:05:21,050
Okay, Linda.

934
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,684
Where did you play?

935
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:25,987
Where did you go with Katie?

936
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,657
Jungles.

937
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,358
In Africa.

938
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:35,364
In France, on the Eiffel Tower.

939
01:05:37,231 --> 01:05:38,701
It hummed at us.

940
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:43,239
But the grass was soft.

941
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:48,242
And Mr. Tickles
always found the best

942
01:05:48,275 --> 01:05:50,278
clues for Nancy.

943
01:05:52,713 --> 01:05:56,751
Linda, where is that?

944
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:59,153
Would Katie have
gone there alone?

945
01:05:59,186 --> 01:06:02,123
Linda, where did Katie go?

946
01:06:07,028 --> 01:06:08,197
Delia.

947
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:11,033
What?

948
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:12,433
Todd, what did she just say?

949
01:06:12,467 --> 01:06:15,170
Delia, I'm Delia.

950
01:06:15,202 --> 01:06:16,137
-Okay, okay.
-I'm Delia.

951
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,638
Okay, Delia.

952
01:06:17,672 --> 01:06:19,708
Okay.

953
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,576
Now where did Katie go?

954
01:06:25,112 --> 01:06:27,582
They took her

955
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:29,050
to France.

956
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:36,057
And they lit up the Eiffel
Tower like fireworks.

957
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,259
And then...

958
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:43,099
And then it all went dark.

959
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:50,106
Who is "they?"

960
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:56,644
I can't tell you.

961
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,414
They'd punish me.
They'd find out.

962
01:06:59,447 --> 01:07:01,716
They always do.

963
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:04,586
All right she's had
enough, Bec, come on.

964
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:05,687
Let's go.

965
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:06,788
No!

966
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,724
You see me?

967
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:12,128
You see me?

968
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:15,831
This is not my skin.

969
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:20,202
They took my skin and
put me inside this!

970
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:25,173
He sees me, he knows who I am!

971
01:07:25,206 --> 01:07:26,607
This is not my skin!

972
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:29,344
This is not my skin!

973
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:31,679
No!

974
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:32,781
This is not my skin!

975
01:07:32,813 --> 01:07:34,516
-Delia!
-No!

976
01:07:34,548 --> 01:07:36,784
No!
No no!

977
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:38,854
This is not my skin!

978
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:44,859
-That was a dead end.
-Yeah.

979
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:46,762
What, Todd? What's wrong?

980
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:48,197
I don't...

981
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,764
Something isn't right.

982
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:54,103
She had a psychotic break.

983
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:54,836
No, it's not that.

984
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:55,770
She's talking gibberish, Todd.

985
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:58,074
It's something that she said.

986
01:08:03,144 --> 01:08:04,780
Look out there.

987
01:08:04,813 --> 01:08:06,248
What? The House?

988
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,550
No no, the transformer.

989
01:08:10,284 --> 01:08:11,152
Okay?

990
01:08:11,186 --> 01:08:13,588
What does it look like?

991
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:14,789
It looks like a
transformer, Todd.

992
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:16,824
No no, but if you
were a little girl,

993
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:18,627
what does it look like?

994
01:08:20,494 --> 01:08:24,432
Imagine you're 11-years-old
on vacation in France.

995
01:08:27,301 --> 01:08:28,436
The Eiffel Tower.

996
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,372
Yeah, exactly.

997
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:31,606
But how did you know?

998
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,809
We pass by it every day.

999
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:36,210
We can see it from our yard.

1000
01:08:36,243 --> 01:08:37,512
And you thought Eiffel Tower?

1001
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:38,914
No no,
it's what she said.

1002
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:39,847
-What?
-Linda.

1003
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:42,717
She said that, "and
then it went dark."

1004
01:08:44,552 --> 01:08:47,489
There was a blackout the
day Katie went missing.

1005
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,293
You think
she's out there, Todd?

1006
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:27,195
Todd, that symbol,
I've seen it before.

1007
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,373
Holy shit.

1008
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:40,943
My god.

1009
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:57,927
I'm so sorry, little one.

1010
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:04,233
You deserved so much more.

1011
01:10:04,265 --> 01:10:06,234
So much more than this.

1012
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:11,405
We need to call the police.

1013
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:12,975
Forensics.

1014
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:17,846
Get them out here so she
can finally be at peace.

1015
01:10:39,466 --> 01:10:41,369
We found you, Katie.

1016
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:45,774
You can go now.

1017
01:10:47,442 --> 01:10:49,278
You're safe.

1018
01:11:25,646 --> 01:11:27,548
-Do you...
-Yes.

1019
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:47,536
Dear diary.

1020
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,738
Robbie told me his
new mom and dad

1021
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:53,108
keep secret stuff
down in the basement.

1022
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:56,644
So we're gonna investigate
like Nancy Drew.

1023
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:49,864
Dear Diary.

1024
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,667
The police took
Robbie's dad today.

1025
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:55,871
He had blood on him and
yelled at the policemen.

1026
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,973
Dad said he took the
disappeared girls.

1027
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,609
That's why the policemen
took Robbie's dad away.

1028
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:01,510
Everyone back!

1029
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:04,078
Robbie? Delia?

1030
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:05,713
What?

1031
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:07,815
It's me, it's me.

1032
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,016
It's me.

1033
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,418
Delia, it's me.

1034
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:11,552
It's not my skin.

1035
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:13,088
It's not my skin.

1036
01:13:17,057 --> 01:13:19,027
It's me.
It's me.

1037
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,429
Dear diary.

1038
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,431
I saw Robbie and Delia.

1039
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:24,166
They were outside my room.

1040
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:26,467
Dad said no one was there,

1041
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:28,136
but they were.

1042
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:30,070
Dear diary.

1043
01:13:30,104 --> 01:13:32,574
Mom and Dad won't listen.

1044
01:13:32,606 --> 01:13:34,576
Maybe it's better.

1045
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:38,747
I don't want Robbie and Delia
to hurt them 'cause of me.

1046
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,582
I'm scared.

1047
01:13:41,615 --> 01:13:44,485
I don't wanna get disappeared.

1048
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:48,556
But if I do, I know
you won't forget me.

1049
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,060
You can remember me if I'm gone.

1050
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:54,462
Goodbye, Mr. Tickles.

1051
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:13,048
My god,
Harold and Francine.

1052
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,248
We've got what we
need and we're gone.

1053
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:16,016
-The authorities.
-And tell them what?

1054
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,185
Who's gonna believe us?

1055
01:14:17,217 --> 01:14:19,587
Honey, we're not safe here.

1056
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,788
What about the house, Todd?

1057
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:22,757
I don't give a shit
about that house.

1058
01:14:22,789 --> 01:14:25,159
I care about you,
and our little baby.

1059
01:14:25,193 --> 01:14:27,695
The rest is storage.

1060
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:28,963
Come on.

1061
01:14:29,796 --> 01:14:32,067
You grab the cash,
I'll grab the clothes!

1062
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,662
Becca!

1063
01:15:05,733 --> 01:15:07,034
No.

1064
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,541
Please don't.

1065
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:17,578
Please don't hurt,
just let her go.

1066
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:20,882
Please.

1067
01:15:20,914 --> 01:15:21,984
Okay.

1068
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:24,653
Please!

1069
01:15:24,685 --> 01:15:25,819
Please.

1070
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,690
No!

1071
01:15:37,798 --> 01:15:39,301
Mom says hi.

1072
01:15:40,201 --> 01:15:41,603
Her last words.

1073
01:15:41,636 --> 01:15:44,205
Loved the teddy bear.

1074
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:46,173
Please stop.

1075
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,611
Whatever you need
you can have, just...

1076
01:15:49,644 --> 01:15:52,079
Just please stop.

1077
01:15:52,113 --> 01:15:53,815
Whatever I want?

1078
01:15:55,649 --> 01:15:58,853
What do you think that
you could give me?

1079
01:16:01,855 --> 01:16:03,291
Anything.

1080
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:08,162
Anything, just let her go.

1081
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:09,730
Take anything.

1082
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:15,971
I will.

1083
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:23,912
What do you want?

1084
01:16:23,944 --> 01:16:26,715
We're leaving, we're
not even a threat to you.

1085
01:16:26,747 --> 01:16:30,652
You never were.

1086
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:32,087
I want you,

1087
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:38,025
to cut yourself.

1088
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:40,362
What?

1089
01:16:42,697 --> 01:16:46,034
Cut yourself across the heart.

1090
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:48,904
Out of love.

1091
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,644
No.

1092
01:16:55,676 --> 01:16:57,112
No?

1093
01:16:58,412 --> 01:17:00,814
It wasn't a request, Toddles.

1094
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:06,354
But don't worry.

1095
01:17:10,824 --> 01:17:12,894
You're playing with a partner.

1096
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:17,798
Okay.

1097
01:17:17,832 --> 01:17:19,334
Okay.

1098
01:17:19,367 --> 01:17:20,735
Okay.

1099
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:37,385
Baby.

1100
01:17:44,057 --> 01:17:45,661
I'm sorry.

1101
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:01,842
They're adorable.

1102
01:18:01,876 --> 01:18:04,445
I told you they
were a lovely couple.

1103
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,148
Sweet as pie.

1104
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,384
We've had our eye
on you, kitten.

1105
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,289
You.

1106
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:27,702
You're so special.

1107
01:18:56,096 --> 01:18:57,931
The boy's got gumption!

1108
01:18:57,965 --> 01:19:00,068
Tenacious!
I like it!

1109
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,737
Very sexy.

1110
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,453
-May I?
-Of course August.

1111
01:19:29,497 --> 01:19:32,267
I'll be back for you.

1112
01:19:39,873 --> 01:19:41,509
Run, Todd, he's coming!

1113
01:20:03,631 --> 01:20:05,500
Front-row seats.

1114
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:27,189
Todd.

1115
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:30,492
Toddy, Toddy, Toddy.

1116
01:20:41,935 --> 01:20:44,005
Come on!

1117
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:49,143
Come on, Harold!

1118
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:53,881
Come on!

1119
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,990
Come on, you motherfucker!

1120
01:21:15,368 --> 01:21:17,605
I love what you've
done with the place.

1121
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,976
Strong bones.

1122
01:21:25,979 --> 01:21:28,315
Nice frontage.

1123
01:21:35,823 --> 01:21:37,658
Of course, I'll have
to change the locks

1124
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,895
and clean the carpets.

1125
01:21:43,163 --> 01:21:44,666
Nice shot, Todd.

1126
01:21:48,502 --> 01:21:50,605
Now me.

1127
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,612
But I just love to nest.

1128
01:21:58,612 --> 01:22:01,548
Especially with two
babies on board.

1129
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:10,658
I like the fight in you, son,

1130
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:12,493
but your round is over.

1131
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:26,707
Are you the devil?

1132
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,577
No.

1133
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:32,246
For Satan is a sign of God.

1134
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:35,216
The fallen Zion
must have a father,

1135
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:38,418
and he is not mine.

1136
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:40,387
But pray to him if you want.

1137
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:42,390
It changes nothing.

1138
01:22:42,422 --> 01:22:44,024
It never does.

1139
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,597
Try harder.

1140
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,034
You took their souls.

1141
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:53,768
No.

1142
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:55,470
Swapped.

1143
01:22:55,502 --> 01:22:57,337
Traded in for an upgrade.

1144
01:22:57,371 --> 01:22:59,306
New chassis.

1145
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,309
Same engine.

1146
01:23:01,341 --> 01:23:04,011
And now daddy wants a new ride.

1147
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:08,015
Here comes the dark.

1148
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,619
Finally.

1149
01:23:12,653 --> 01:23:14,756
Wouldn't be the
same without you.

1150
01:23:14,788 --> 01:23:16,623
That's enough, Harold.

1151
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:22,030
That's not my name.

1152
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:25,733
Whoever the fuck you
are, this ends now!

1153
01:23:25,765 --> 01:23:27,701
Not the way you think.

1154
01:23:47,154 --> 01:23:48,423
Todd.

1155
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:52,159
Go.

1156
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:57,131
Go, baby, go.

1157
01:24:01,368 --> 01:24:03,371
Get somewhere safe.

1158
01:24:05,305 --> 01:24:06,473
Todd.

1159
01:24:06,506 --> 01:24:08,308
Todd, look at me.
I'm okay.

1160
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:09,844
I'm here.

1161
01:24:09,877 --> 01:24:11,579
I'm here right beside you.

1162
01:24:11,612 --> 01:24:13,581
Look at me.

1163
01:24:17,518 --> 01:24:19,619
But I'm leaving.

1164
01:24:19,653 --> 01:24:21,622
Please stay.

1165
01:24:21,654 --> 01:24:22,756
You can't leave me.

1166
01:24:22,789 --> 01:24:24,859
Please stay, Todd.

1167
01:24:24,891 --> 01:24:27,461
I never will.

1168
01:24:27,494 --> 01:24:31,565
Todd,
you can't leave me.

1169
01:24:40,573 --> 01:24:42,844
Todd, Todd.

1170
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,313
Todd, no.

1171
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:16,844
You shouldn't be up, sweety.

1172
01:25:16,877 --> 01:25:19,714
I won't tell.

1173
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:22,383
I couldn't keep me away
if it was me either.

1174
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,886
Do you have any names yet?

1175
01:25:27,688 --> 01:25:30,291
She will be Drusilla.

1176
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:35,563
And he is August.

1177
01:25:35,595 --> 01:25:37,831
So Todd is his middle name?

1178
01:25:37,864 --> 01:25:39,166
No.

1179
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,201
Why?
