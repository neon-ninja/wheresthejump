1
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:59,327
<i>In the year of our Lord, 1442,</i>

2
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:05,164
<i>the Turkish sultan enslaved
1,000 Transylvanian boys</i>

3
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,322
<i>to fill the ranks of his army.</i>

4
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:14,297
<i>These child slaves
were beaten without mercy,</i>

5
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:19,101
<i>trained to kill without conscience,</i>

6
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,206
<i>to crave the blood</i>

7
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:24,943
<i>of all who defied the Turks.</i>

8
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,723
<i>From among these boys,</i>

9
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,393
<i>one grew into a warrior so fierce</i>

10
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,605
<i>that entire armies
would retreat in terror</i>

11
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,078
<i>with the mention of his name.</i>

12
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:48,404
<i>Vlad the Impaler.</i>

13
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,718
<i>Son of the Dragon.</i>

14
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,080
<i>Sickened by his monstrous acts,</i>

15
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,041
<i>Vlad came to bury his past with the dead</i>

16
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:03,878
<i>and returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.</i>

17
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:06,798
<i>His subjects called him Prince.</i>

18
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:10,051
<i>I called him Father.</i>

19
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:12,887
<i>But the world
would come to know him as...</i>

20
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,108
<i>Dracula.</i>

21
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:34,792
I left it...

22
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:37,591
Where I found it.

23
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:42,644
What do you think, Vlad?

24
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,297
Bring it to me.

25
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:01,865
This belongs to a scout.

26
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,491
One of Hamza Bey's men.

27
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,993
What the hell's a lone
Turk doing out here?

28
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:10,340
Turkish scouts never travel alone.

29
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:12,257
If there's one, there's more.

30
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:15,964
And whatever they scout, they conquer.

31
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:26,520
This was washed downstream.

32
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:31,933
Came from up there.

33
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:35,190
Broken Tooth Mountain.

34
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:40,633
Soon it will be night.
They'll seek refuge.

35
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,770
Dimitru, I need you
to return to the castle.

36
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:47,127
- Alert the guards and double the sentry.
- What? I'm not leaving you here.

37
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,276
For the Turks to cross into my
land unannounced is a sign of war.

38
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,945
What are you going
to do if you find them?

39
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,468
I'll do what princes do best. Negotiate.

40
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,867
Nicolae, Andrei, with me.

41
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,616
Fall in!

42
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,013
Anything?

43
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,170
Smells like your feet.

44
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:02,045
- They're inside.
- How do you know?

45
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:06,287
Bats don't come out during the day.
Something's disturbed them.

46
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:10,788
Come on.

47
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,759
What is it, My Lord?

48
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,818
The floor.

49
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,173
It's crushed bone.

50
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:07,929
The Turks didn't do this.

51
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,259
What's that?

52
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,575
We leave, now.

53
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,312
The creature you encountered
was no accident, My Prince.

54
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:42,404
Four nights ago, every brother in our
order awoke from an identical dream.

55
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:45,487
I would not have thought it possible
had I not suffered the same vision

56
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,992
myself that night.

57
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:52,070
Of a creature laying siege
to this holy place.

58
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,669
The Roman mystics prophesied
the coming of a great evil.

59
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,130
A vampire.

60
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,201
From the Greek word...

61
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:07,433
<i>pi,</i> to drink.

62
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,414
The beast was once a mortal man who
summoned a demon from the depths of hell

63
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,183
<i>to trade for his dark power.</i>

64
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,463
<i>The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish,</i>

65
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,905
<i>but his price was an eternity
condemned to the darkness of that cave,</i>

66
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,356
<i>where he remains until he finds another</i>

67
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,616
<i>to set him free.</i>

68
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,704
Now you know its true face.

69
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:39,997
The people of Transylvania live in
enough fear of the <i>Turks'</i> return.

70
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,237
Promise me you'll guard
this secret, brother.

71
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:57,181
Papa!

72
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:01,920
- I missed you.
- And I, you.

73
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,731
My big soldier.

74
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:13,266
- What? An embrace but no kiss?
- Are we going to argue?

75
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,200
With you always leaving, I need my fill.

76
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:20,293
I've missed you.

77
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:24,358
Something troubles you. What is it?

78
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,506
Only the impossible
depth of your beauty.

79
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,628
Puts the rest of the world to shame.

80
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,663
Pay no attention to
your father, Ingeras.

81
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:37,890
Flattery is a cheap
distraction from truth.

82
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:41,628
- She knows all my tricks.
- You're a terrible liar.

83
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:44,313
It's one of your most
endearing qualities.

84
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,276
You're just in time for bed.

85
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,227
- Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?
- Of course we can.

86
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,647
- You most certainly cannot.
- Why not?

87
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,917
Because tomorrow is
the day of our risen Lord.

88
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:05,494
- Oh, of course.
- That's Easter.

89
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,251
What was I thinking?

90
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,807
So what attacked you?

91
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:18,471
Wolves?

92
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,555
I suppose.

93
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:31,979
All I know is that I've
lost two good men today.

94
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,251
There's something more.

95
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:57,879
I was the same age as Ingeras
when I was sent to live with the Turks.

96
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,221
To fight for them.

97
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:07,107
If I never saw another,
it would be too soon.

98
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:12,897
You're home now.

99
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:17,659
For almost as many years
as you were gone.

100
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,121
I just want peace.

101
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,541
That's all.

102
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,209
My fellow Transylvanians,
an Easter toast.

103
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:56,279
Ten years of peace and prosperity
ever since our prince came back to us.

104
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:00,422
- My old friend, here's to 20 more.
- To 20 more!

105
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,153
Hamza Bey.

106
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:35,811
Welcome.

107
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,066
We were not expecting you so soon.

108
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:42,433
Sultan Mehmed II offers his
salutations to you and your son.

109
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:45,912
Thank him. I have his tribute ready.

110
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,739
I'm afraid there's something
more than a tribute to discuss.

111
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,587
The Turks have no enemies here.

112
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:02,595
Did you think we would not notice
a battalion of our scouts missing?

113
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,808
I did not kill them.

114
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:10,251
<b>It still lives inside you, Lord Impaler.</b>

115
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:14,483
<b>Locked in a dark cage, hidden away.</b>

116
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:20,316
<b>But you and I...
We both know it's there.</b>

117
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,121
The sultan's tribute.

118
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,542
Take it and leave.

119
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,336
There is one last thing.

120
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:48,666
The sultan requires 1,000 boys
to join his Janissary Corps.

121
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:52,977
- No!
- Never!

122
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:57,394
Janissaries?
He ended that practice years ago.

123
00:13:57,613 --> 00:14:01,397
When a soldier is plucked as a child

124
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,066
and raised to know no other life,

125
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:08,289
they will kill without question
and die without complaint.

126
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,998
Any who are 15 years of age
or older will fight in Hungary.

127
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:18,959
Those 10 to 14 will be made
ready for the siege on Vienna.

128
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,500
The sultan expects your obedience.

129
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:27,516
After all, did not your own father
give you up without a fight?

130
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,686
<b>Soft, but they'll do.</b>

131
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:37,482
Don't. Please.

132
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,988
<b>Do you know who I am?</b>

133
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:47,530
<b>You mean who you were.</b>

134
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,583
<b>You have no army and no choice, Prince.</b>

135
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,587
<b>Follow our command,
or suffer the consequences.</b>

136
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,803
It must be done.

137
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:15,687
Courage, anger, even love.
None of these can matter to a prince.

138
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:19,191
All that matters is his
duty to his people.

139
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:25,743
What does it mean to be a royal hostage?

140
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:30,364
My father gave me to the
sultan to prove his loyalty.

141
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,624
Were you scared there? With them?

142
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,534
I wanted to make my father proud.

143
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:40,038
Would you ever give me to the sultan?

144
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:45,710
That was a long time ago.

145
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:50,945
You have nothing to worry about.

146
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,643
Do you understand?

147
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,064
Good.

148
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:15,198
<i>If I defy the order,
they'll kill 100 for every one I save.</i>

149
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:18,954
You told me you and Mehmed
were once like brothers.

150
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:22,444
Were you to ask,

151
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,751
isn't it possible he might
show you some mercy?

152
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,517
You ever seen the like of it?

153
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:55,197
Soon the entire world will be Turk.

154
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:13,424
Lord Impaler,

155
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:17,264
my oldest of friends.

156
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,211
I miss our days together.

157
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:23,623
All I miss from my time
with you is the coffee.

158
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:28,084
It's true, my father's palace was a cruel
place for a young boy far from home.

159
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:30,388
But soon you talked like us,

160
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:33,384
prayed like us, fought like us.

161
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:38,930
Speaking of which, I am owed 1,000 boys.

162
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:43,266
Why have I not seen them?

163
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,813
Mehmed, my brother,

164
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,691
- I will grant you anything else.
- I need soldiers,

165
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:52,982
brother.

166
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,891
Then take me.

167
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:05,214
I'm worth 1,000 boys, and you know it.

168
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:09,302
- Those kings would tremble if they knew.
- Then accept my offer.

169
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,598
When we were boys,
how I longed to fight side by side.

170
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:17,306
But now I am sultan, what need
have I for one more soldier?

171
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,726
I will have my 1,000 boys.

172
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:22,262
And one more.

173
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:28,196
<i>Your son will be raised under my roof,</i>

174
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,783
<i>just as you were raised
under the roof of my father.</i>

175
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:34,399
You may retain your throne.

176
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:39,103
But General Ismail will remain to
see that my orders are fulfilled.

177
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,301
<b>Please. Do not do this.</b>

178
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,128
What is one son?

179
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:48,169
If you are virile,
you'll make plenty more.

180
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:04,347
Whoa, there.

181
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:24,731
- You promised me this would never happen.
- Mirena, listen.

182
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:27,534
The day you asked for my hand,
do you remember what I said?

183
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,966
- You said no.
- Stay, my young friend.

184
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,510
I knew what happens
to the sons of the queen.

185
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,804
You said things would be different.

186
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,219
You said if I loved you,
I should trust you.

187
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:38,474
I loved you!

188
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,125
- Then trust me.
- It's this or we start a war.

189
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,209
<b>The Great Impaler
can't please his woman.</b>

190
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:46,649
Everything's fine, boys.
They're just saying their goodbyes is all.

191
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:48,192
- Mirena.
- I won't let you...

192
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:50,361
- You promised me my family!
- Mirena, please!

193
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:52,030
Stop it! Don't touch me!

194
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:55,364
I won't! I won't let them do this!

195
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:57,235
Vlad, don't! Don't do this!

196
00:19:58,182 --> 00:19:59,864
No! No!

197
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,168
- No, I won't let you do this!
- I'll go.

198
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,765
- I won't! No!
- I'll go!

199
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:19,806
I can do it.

200
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,433
You're proud of me, aren't you?

201
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,188
Of course I am.

202
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:42,028
You have chosen wisely.

203
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:45,750
Yeah, I have to say,
we are a little disappointed.

204
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:48,082
Frankly, I expected more

205
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:51,064
resistance from you.

206
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,054
Run to your mother.

207
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:08,762
- What?
- Now!

208
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,045
Come here!

209
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:17,949
Don't look!

210
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:02,234
Mehmed will punish all of Transylvania
for what you have done.

211
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,944
It's not a child's place
to save his country.

212
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,866
Get my family to the castle.

213
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,815
Mehmed will be sending
others soon enough.

214
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,836
War will come.

215
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,081
You can't protect us.

216
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:20,051
I'll find a way.

217
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,056
Vlad! Where are you going?

218
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,060
Whatever haunts Broken Tooth,
I know it kills Turks.

219
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,454
You returned.

220
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,328
No one has ever returned.

221
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:46,264
It seems no one has ever had
the privilege of leaving, either.

222
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:50,466
Neither will you.

223
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:32,388
Those whom enter reek of fear.

224
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:37,438
In you, I sense hope.

225
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:47,610
Your silver offends me.
Cloak it from my sight.

226
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,533
What kind of man crawls into his
own grave in search of hope?

227
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:59,462
A desperate one.

228
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:02,422
The Turks threaten
to destroy my kingdom.

229
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:06,585
With power like yours,
I could stop them,

230
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:11,036
save my people, save my family.

231
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,761
How supremely noble, Lord Impaler.

232
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:18,894
House Dracul, Son of the Devil.

233
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:21,440
You're mistaken.

234
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:26,101
It means "son of the dragon."
Protector of the innocent.

235
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:30,415
Do your people know how many innocents

236
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,187
you have killed?

237
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,615
Was it hundreds?

238
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:37,489
Yes.

239
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,758
Lie to me again and I'll open
you from your belly to your brain

240
00:25:45,863 --> 00:25:48,125
and feed you your intestines.

241
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,470
Thousands.

242
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:52,557
And when you put them to
the stake, what did you feel?

243
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:54,675
Shame? Horror?

244
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:56,518
Power?

245
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,607
- Answer me!
- Nothing!

246
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:04,360
I felt nothing.
A greater crime than the act itself.

247
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:08,111
Then why spill blood
if not for the pleasure of it?

248
00:26:08,823 --> 00:26:11,444
Because men do not fear swords.

249
00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:13,696
They fear monsters.

250
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,581
They run from them.

251
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:20,331
By putting one village to the stake,
I spared 10 more.

252
00:26:21,064 --> 00:26:24,335
Sometimes the world
no longer needs a hero.

253
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,337
Sometimes what it needs is a monster.

254
00:26:28,843 --> 00:26:33,133
And you believe you know
what it is to be a monster?

255
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:03,200
You have no idea.

256
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,254
But I'm going to show you.

257
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:14,201
For centuries, these moldering
walls have been my gallows.

258
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:18,388
For I'm bound to this cave,
condemned by one who turned me.

259
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:22,938
Oh, and I have waited an eternity
for a man of your strength,

260
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:27,692
your gifts, your will.
A man worthy of the dark

261
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:29,464
and all its powers.

262
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:33,866
For if I am your salvation,

263
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:35,403
you are mine.

264
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,086
Drink. You will have
a taste of my power.

265
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:52,719
The strength of 100 men.
The speed of a falling star.

266
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:55,847
Dominion over the night
and all its creatures.

267
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:59,471
To see and hear through their senses.

268
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:06,190
- Even heal grievous wounds.
- At what price?

269
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:07,901
Once you drink,

270
00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:11,729
your thirst for human blood
will be insatiable.

271
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:17,035
But if you can resist for three days,

272
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:20,934
you will return to your mortal state
having sampled my power,

273
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,121
and perhaps, saved your people.

274
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,876
And if I feed?

275
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,418
The price would be worse than
if you'd never stepped in here.

276
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:34,635
For I will be set free having granted
the darkness a worthy offering.

277
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,764
You will become its vessel as I am.

278
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:42,769
A scourge on this earth destined to
destroy everything you hold dear.

279
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:47,106
Your lands, your people,
even your precious wife and son.

280
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:51,277
- I would die before I harmed them.
- Indeed you will, I'm afraid.

281
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:54,902
I, however, will at last
be free to unleash my wrath

282
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:57,033
against the one who betrayed me.

283
00:28:57,137 --> 00:29:01,191
And one day, I will call on
you to serve me, my pawn,

284
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:05,646
- in an immortal game of revenge.
- This is not a game!

285
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,836
But what better way to endure eternity?

286
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:13,043
For this, little prince,
is the ultimate game.

287
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:18,554
Light versus dark, hope versus despair.

288
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:23,306
And all the world's fate
hangs in the balance.

289
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:27,218
Then it will be my great pleasure
to disappoint you.

290
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:29,429
Drink.

291
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:36,479
Let the games begin.

292
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:02,989
What now?

293
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,178
Now,

294
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:08,535
you die.

295
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:31,720
<i>Papa!</i>

296
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:12,932
That's useful.

297
00:32:58,232 --> 00:32:59,836
Prepare to fire!

298
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:03,810
Light!

299
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:31,744
- You came back.
- I always will.

300
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,834
- Where were you?
- Searching for the strength I needed.

301
00:33:36,938 --> 00:33:38,313
You're back!

302
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:55,018
- They wanted our sons!
- We can't fight.

303
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:57,765
A good prince would have given them up.

304
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:01,567
A good prince would have
paid that price for peace.

305
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:05,186
But I give you my word,

306
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:08,250
we will not be defeated!

307
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,443
They've brought war to our land.

308
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:14,788
And they will pay dearly for it.

309
00:34:14,892 --> 00:34:16,684
Fire!

310
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:35,809
Charge!

311
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,147
What? Wait.

312
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:45,349
Negotiations failed.

313
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:51,630
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight.

314
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:55,089
Trust only that I will use
all I have to keep us safe.

315
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:58,344
But we will not be safe if we stay here.

316
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,765
<i>We must leave directly
for Cozia Monastery.</i>

317
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:05,618
<i>It's high in the mountains,
too remote for cannon fire.</i>

318
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:07,888
<i>It's our best chance of survival.</i>

319
00:38:09,127 --> 00:38:11,961
<i>We'll take enough of our people
so that our absence is noticed.</i>

320
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:16,688
<i>That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here,</i>

321
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:19,366
<i>he will come hunting for us.</i>

322
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:24,536
Word from Castle Dracula.
Vlad has defeated 1,000 of our men.

323
00:38:26,185 --> 00:38:29,305
Then send 100,000. I will lead them.

324
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:34,965
When I march into Europe,
I will have his head upon my spear

325
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:37,800
and his child at my side.

326
00:38:39,324 --> 00:38:42,180
We can fight the way our
great-grandfathers fought.

327
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:46,435
Use the forests, the mountains
around the Borgo Pass.

328
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:48,932
- Four or five months of that.
- Not months.

329
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:52,639
I'm gonna win this war in three days.

330
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,859
Why not two? That'd really impress us.

331
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,314
Feed.

332
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:29,297
What is it?

333
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:34,416
I need some air.

334
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:36,205
I'm sorry.

335
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:58,309
Don't think I haven't
noticed you following me.

336
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:00,504
You're mistaken.

337
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:02,455
I follow them.

338
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:06,028
They recognize one of their own.

339
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:09,870
The night is their kingdom.

340
00:41:09,974 --> 00:41:12,873
Blood, their sustenance.

341
00:41:12,977 --> 00:41:14,833
And some, they say,

342
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:18,878
have lived for as long as there
have been prey to devour.

343
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:21,003
Spare me your ravings.

344
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:26,136
They say the one who
escaped the mountain

345
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:29,848
hides behind the face of a man.

346
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:33,428
Well, if that man is me,

347
00:41:33,706 --> 00:41:36,313
you'll know a knife will
not do you any good.

348
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,973
Of course not.

349
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:43,436
Why do you think I stayed?

350
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:53,491
I know there is only so far
on this earth we can run,

351
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:58,831
and it is not far enough.

352
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:04,164
Let me serve you.

353
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:19,269
Stay away from me.

354
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:26,837
Yes, master.

355
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:42,956
<i>Fulfill your destiny.</i>

356
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:46,837
<i>Set me free.</i>

357
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,486
We found him in the field.
He asked for you.

358
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:14,890
A message from Prince Vlad.

359
00:43:15,683 --> 00:43:18,782
He hopes you enjoy the view.

360
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:10,710
- Mirena!
- Your scars are gone.

361
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:16,007
What's happening to you?

362
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,706
I'm the thing men fear on Broken Tooth.

363
00:44:27,714 --> 00:44:28,912
Not a ghost.

364
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:32,424
Something else.

365
00:44:42,437 --> 00:44:43,599
No! Stop it!

366
00:44:44,564 --> 00:44:47,296
May God strike down
whoever did this to you.

367
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,290
I chose this.

368
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,713
This is the strength you sought?

369
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:57,780
But why?

370
00:45:00,413 --> 00:45:03,305
Because I sent corpses back to Mehmed

371
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,769
instead of our son.

372
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:11,185
- You did this for us?
- In two days, I'll be restored.

373
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:15,105
I just have to resist.

374
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,610
Resist what?

375
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:24,389
Resist what, Vlad? Tell me!

376
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:27,834
A thirst

377
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:30,312
for blood.

378
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:37,593
And if you were to give in?

379
00:45:38,993 --> 00:45:41,569
Then I become this for eternity.

380
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:49,264
You will undo this, won't you?

381
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:50,577
Yes.

382
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,194
I swear it. I will not give in.

383
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:57,751
Then God will forgive you.

384
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:00,295
Vlad.

385
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:03,489
Mehmed is getting closer.
We might want to move out soon.

386
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:07,156
I need you to get to the monastery
as quickly as you can.

387
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,065
- Mehmed's men will be close by.
- No.

388
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:14,312
Listen to me. I will reach you
after sundown. I promise you.

389
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,175
I love you.

390
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,503
My husband agrees with your counsel.

391
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:43,912
We will depart now under
your temporary command.

392
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:48,581
- What? And where's Vlad going to be?
- Spying on the Turks.

393
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,869
He insists on doing
his own reconnaissance.

394
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:54,548
- No. I won't have it.
- It's too late.

395
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:56,339
He's already gone.

396
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:00,668
All right, everyone,

397
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,657
- prepare to move out.
- Prepare the horses.

398
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:23,446
Tell the sultan where his
enemies will be buried.

399
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:53,935
Listen.

400
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:56,333
We're nearly there.

401
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:16,582
Cover the rear!

402
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,695
Mirena!

403
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:28,324
Mirena! Ingeras!

404
00:48:50,768 --> 00:48:54,033
Couldn't these monks have built
their gates a little bit closer?

405
00:49:04,532 --> 00:49:06,047
Stay behind me.

406
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:27,242
Don't the Turks teach you anything new?

407
00:49:27,347 --> 00:49:29,278
I saw your blade coming from...

408
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,125
Ingeras, run.

409
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:36,889
Where is your prince now,

410
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:39,916
My Lady?

411
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,035
Dimitru. It's okay.

412
00:50:18,523 --> 00:50:20,169
It's okay.

413
00:50:20,963 --> 00:50:22,542
Vlad.

414
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:27,089
Dimitru, listen. Listen!

415
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:35,591
No!

416
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:55,159
Come here. Come here.

417
00:50:56,832 --> 00:50:59,389
Never leave us again, Papa.

418
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:01,790
Never.

419
00:51:02,775 --> 00:51:04,956
I will always watch over you.

420
00:51:10,158 --> 00:51:12,234
Through the gates!

421
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:18,491
Keep moving along! This way!

422
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,747
You should never have strayed from us,

423
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:37,006
- whatever your reasons for leaving were...
- Quiet.

424
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:41,877
Get these men off their knees.

425
00:51:42,086 --> 00:51:44,582
Stand up, do you hear me? Stand up!

426
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,293
The Turks are coming!

427
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:50,837
Prayers will not defend these walls!

428
00:51:57,038 --> 00:51:59,384
Do you believe we can do this?

429
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:02,502
Mehmed's men will be
coming from the north.

430
00:52:02,606 --> 00:52:04,983
Double our sentries
on the perimeter walls.

431
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,350
Go. Do it now.

432
00:52:07,882 --> 00:52:09,689
What's in there?

433
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,992
Something I hope to never use again.

434
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:18,532
Come now.

435
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:30,397
The men say that Vlad
has become a monster.

436
00:52:30,738 --> 00:52:34,888
I fear this will only inflame the rumors
of the Prince's dark magic.

437
00:52:34,993 --> 00:52:36,924
Only if we allow it.

438
00:52:37,912 --> 00:52:40,928
Men cannot fear what they cannot see.

439
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,946
Remember when you first joined my army.

440
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:54,025
You wanted to pick up
your sword and fight!

441
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:58,993
When my generals blindfolded you,

442
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:04,204
you did not believe that you
could march without seeing.

443
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,335
But you could.

444
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:11,175
Now march with me!

445
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:14,633
Your sultan will guide you!

446
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:15,406
Prince Vlad,

447
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,449
the vampire is vulnerable to daylight.

448
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:24,241
And to pure silver.

449
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:33,729
Yet the holy cross
exerts no power over you.

450
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:37,799
That can only mean you have yet
to seal your fate with human blood.

451
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,586
Let me kill you now, My Prince.

452
00:54:42,328 --> 00:54:45,477
Please. Before your people do.

453
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,251
Rumor has spread of
what you have become.

454
00:54:48,543 --> 00:54:50,785
You can still repent.

455
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,412
You'd do well to run, Lucian.

456
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,991
It's true! He's a monster!

457
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:14,933
No!

458
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:19,219
Please! Listen! He is your prince!

459
00:55:19,324 --> 00:55:21,197
He has earned the chance to explain.

460
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:23,379
Stop!

461
00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:25,828
- Please! He's your prince!
- Kill the monster!

462
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:28,956
Satan lives in his heart!

463
00:55:32,879 --> 00:55:34,146
Vlad!

464
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:56,131
- Mirena!
- He was trying to save us all!

465
00:56:08,706 --> 00:56:12,064
Take him to my room and shut the door.
Do not let him look outside!

466
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,105
- Okay.
- Mama!

467
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:44,576
This is your loyalty?

468
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:47,087
Your gratitude?

469
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,661
Fools.

470
00:56:50,665 --> 00:56:53,749
Do you think you are alive
because you can fight?

471
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,095
Come on.

472
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:00,047
You are alive because of me!

473
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:06,877
Because of what I did to save you!

474
00:57:14,105 --> 00:57:17,127
This is not who you are.

475
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,540
Return to your stations.

476
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:39,646
Believe me, there is still more to fear!

477
00:57:44,218 --> 00:57:48,702
Lord, if you've not yet forsaken me,

478
00:57:48,806 --> 00:57:52,493
grant me your strength
that I may resist the darkness.

479
00:57:53,478 --> 00:57:57,710
Allow me to endure
this test one more day.

480
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,833
I beg you.

481
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:05,019
Please.

482
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:23,840
Are you sick?

483
00:58:28,263 --> 00:58:32,475
If you were sick, I thought
it might make you feel better.

484
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:40,826
Thank you. Come.

485
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,718
You'll make a great leader someday.

486
00:58:53,288 --> 00:58:55,364
You think of others before yourself.

487
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:59,498
When the Turks came to take me,

488
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:01,763
you stopped them.

489
00:59:04,048 --> 00:59:08,149
It's why you got sick, isn't it?
To save me.

490
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,903
Yes.

491
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:15,076
And I would do it all again.

492
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:50,587
They're almost here.

493
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:58,389
Dawn will be breaking soon.
And with it, the loss of my powers.

494
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:03,478
- If we've not won this war by then...
- I will fight beside you until death.

495
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:06,027
Your death would end my fight.

496
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,440
We have done the duty
of any good parent.

497
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:14,300
Protected our child.
Protected all the children in the kingdom.

498
01:00:14,953 --> 01:00:18,093
Perhaps our destiny
was not to rule in this life.

499
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,345
Do you remember our wedding vow?

500
01:00:24,629 --> 01:00:27,486
"Why think separately
of this life and the next..."

501
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,652
"When one is born from the last?"

502
01:00:30,343 --> 01:00:33,865
Time is always too short
for those who need it.

503
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:39,302
But for those who love,
it lasts forever.

504
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:35,162
No!

505
01:03:35,424 --> 01:03:37,551
Hold your ground!

506
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:39,462
Stand your ground!

507
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:43,222
Hold fast! Hold your ground!

508
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,432
Fire!

509
01:04:20,907 --> 01:04:22,345
Mehmed!

510
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:25,150
No.

511
01:04:26,725 --> 01:04:29,852
Where is he? Where is he?

512
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:31,183
Fire!

513
01:04:32,126 --> 01:04:33,289
Draw!

514
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,375
Fire!

515
01:04:42,804 --> 01:04:44,231
Find your father! Go!

516
01:04:57,777 --> 01:04:59,225
Where is he?

517
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,466
You can keep running if you like.

518
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:23,733
- Let me go!
- No!

519
01:05:25,763 --> 01:05:27,030
Mirena.

520
01:05:31,936 --> 01:05:35,015
- No! Please!
- Ingeras!

521
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:47,685
No!

522
01:06:02,467 --> 01:06:03,857
Vlad!

523
01:06:05,887 --> 01:06:07,236
No!

524
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,957
No, Mirena.

525
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:57,876
Please, stay with me.

526
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,327
I cannot do this without you.

527
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:15,596
Mirena.

528
01:07:24,445 --> 01:07:26,188
There's still time for you to stop them.

529
01:07:29,429 --> 01:07:31,256
Drink my blood.

530
01:07:31,827 --> 01:07:35,032
No. I cannot take your life.

531
01:07:37,103 --> 01:07:39,909
My life is lost already.

532
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:44,532
- But our son's is not.
- No.

533
01:07:47,655 --> 01:07:49,586
I love you.

534
01:07:53,578 --> 01:07:55,051
Do it now!

535
01:08:01,419 --> 01:08:02,338
Please.

536
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:10,443
Do it now.

537
01:08:23,837 --> 01:08:24,556
Vlad!

538
01:09:04,482 --> 01:09:06,807
No!

539
01:09:29,757 --> 01:09:31,396
Do you want vengeance?

540
01:09:41,728 --> 01:09:43,160
Drink.

541
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,601
<i>I now know hell is real.</i>

542
01:10:26,835 --> 01:10:29,120
<i>So I know there's a heaven.</i>

543
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:33,363
<i>Neither this world or the next
shall keep us apart.</i>

544
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:39,764
<i>I will honor your sacrifice and I
vow that our son shall be safe.</i>

545
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:51,392
Of all of my lands,
this is the one I love the least.

546
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,927
Look to the east.

547
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:00,953
The sun should be risen
by now, should it not?

548
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:13,089
What is that?

549
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:20,779
It is the Prince. He is coming.

550
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:11,774
I used to think there
were too many of you.

551
01:12:11,878 --> 01:12:13,275
Now there's not enough.

552
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:14,034
I understand you have a weakness

553
01:13:14,816 --> 01:13:16,539
for silver.

554
01:13:26,578 --> 01:13:27,884
Papa!

555
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,283
He's waiting for you.

556
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,007
You are slower, brother. And weaker.

557
01:14:21,215 --> 01:14:22,351
Aw...

558
01:14:23,718 --> 01:14:25,981
Go on, take it.

559
01:14:27,388 --> 01:14:30,010
Is this the monster
that terrified my men?

560
01:14:34,062 --> 01:14:35,888
You grow more weary by the moment.

561
01:14:37,982 --> 01:14:39,784
Tell me,

562
01:14:40,318 --> 01:14:42,787
how long can you bear it in here?

563
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:48,839
Long enough to strike your name
from the history books.

564
01:15:22,798 --> 01:15:23,725
Papa!

565
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,828
Take a last look at
your father, Ingeras.

566
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:33,725
- No!
- Look how pathetic he is.

567
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:37,103
No, stop! Please!

568
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:47,698
If I put a stake through your heart,

569
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:52,033
It will kill you

570
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:54,141
like any other man.

571
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:58,645
A fitting death

572
01:15:59,126 --> 01:16:02,314
- for Lord Impaler.
- No! No!

573
01:16:16,247 --> 01:16:17,492
Papa!

574
01:16:26,424 --> 01:16:30,651
That is no longer my name.
My name is Dracula.

575
01:16:32,764 --> 01:16:34,777
Son of the Devil.

576
01:17:14,555 --> 01:17:17,781
It's all right. I'm here.

577
01:17:47,255 --> 01:17:50,978
- You old goat.
- I don't feel old.

578
01:17:53,386 --> 01:17:58,115
- How many are left?
- None, except for your son, of course.

579
01:17:58,683 --> 01:18:00,618
A distraction we can now

580
01:18:01,019 --> 01:18:02,574
dispense with.

581
01:18:08,234 --> 01:18:10,255
What have I taught you?

582
01:18:10,695 --> 01:18:14,838
Repeated over and over
since you were a boy?

583
01:18:16,534 --> 01:18:19,799
All that matters is a
prince's duty to his people.

584
01:18:20,204 --> 01:18:23,264
- Ingeras.
- Don't you realize?

585
01:18:23,812 --> 01:18:26,019
They're all our enemies now.

586
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:30,277
When he's gone, you'll be free.

587
01:18:38,097 --> 01:18:41,528
You forget who I am.

588
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:20,816
Leave him.

589
01:19:27,355 --> 01:19:30,409
Come with me, child. Come.

590
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:34,612
Please.

591
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:36,518
Be gone!

592
01:19:38,741 --> 01:19:42,717
The time has come. Please.
Please, you must come.

593
01:19:44,789 --> 01:19:47,227
I don't want to leave you!

594
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:49,970
- You have to go with him.
- No!

595
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:53,240
Do not leave his side.

596
01:19:55,675 --> 01:19:58,449
- Please.
- Know I will always love you.

597
01:19:58,553 --> 01:20:00,324
Always.

598
01:20:04,309 --> 01:20:05,969
- Go!
- No!

599
01:20:07,353 --> 01:20:08,829
Go!

600
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:12,356
- No!
- You take care of him.

601
01:20:14,068 --> 01:20:15,755
No!

602
01:20:16,362 --> 01:20:17,915
Papa!

603
01:20:18,823 --> 01:20:20,825
No!

604
01:20:32,045 --> 01:20:34,480
He's safe now, Mirena.

605
01:21:57,651 --> 01:22:01,316
<i>The Turks never conquered
the capitals of Europe.</i>

606
01:22:06,952 --> 01:22:10,344
<i>Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.</i>

607
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:16,097
<i>But there are no pictures</i>

608
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:17,661
<i>or statues of him.</i>

609
01:22:23,156 --> 01:22:25,044
<i>I am his legacy.</i>

610
01:22:26,993 --> 01:22:30,721
<i>His sacrifice taught me that
even after the darkest night,</i>

611
01:22:31,539 --> 01:22:33,724
<i>the sun will rise again.</i>

612
01:22:34,626 --> 01:22:36,639
Drink, master.

613
01:22:38,442 --> 01:22:41,246
<i>For if the heart is strong enough,</i>

614
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:44,187
<i>the soul is reborn</i>

615
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,446
<i>with each new day.</i>

616
01:22:50,683 --> 01:22:52,911
<i>In life after life.</i>

617
01:22:55,855 --> 01:22:58,248
<i>Age after age.</i>

618
01:23:02,028 --> 01:23:03,626
<i>Forever.</i>

619
01:23:12,872 --> 01:23:14,487
Lovely.

620
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:18,503
- Which markets are you at this week?
- Portobello Road next.

621
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:20,358
See you there?

622
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:30,295
Beautiful.

623
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:35,970
The flowers, my lady.

624
01:23:37,021 --> 01:23:38,709
My lady?

625
01:23:40,066 --> 01:23:43,630
- Where are you from?
- A long way from here.

626
01:23:49,951 --> 01:23:51,066
Well, good night.

627
01:23:52,787 --> 01:23:55,978
"Why think separately
of this life and the next

628
01:23:56,082 --> 01:23:58,808
"when one is born from the last?"

629
01:24:04,757 --> 01:24:06,064
That's my favorite poem.

630
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:09,366
It speaks to you of yearning,

631
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:12,113
of one soul pleading for another.

632
01:24:16,728 --> 01:24:18,186
I'm Mina.

633
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:21,747
Vlad.

634
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:58,844
Let the games begin.
