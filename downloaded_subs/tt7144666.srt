- That was Moose.
- I don't care.

00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,001
Moose is a giant asshole.

110
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,361
I know.

111
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,462
But last year, when he made
your nose bleed...-Gwen.

112
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,424
-He had it coming.

113
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,059
No one has that coming.

114
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:12,470
- Finney, he beat you up.
- I know, Gwen.

115
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:14,129
I was there, remember? I...

116
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,398
I just don't want
to talk about it.

117
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:19,300
Well, he was stupid to pick
a fight with Robin Arellano.

118
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,102
He's the toughest kid in school

119
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,004
since The Grabber got
Pinball Vance Hopper.

120
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,406
I wish you wouldn't
call him that.

121
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,207
Everyone called
him Pinball Vance.

122
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,123
No, I mean...

123
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,013
I know who you mean, jerk face.

124
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,307
Even the papers call
him The Grabber.

125
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,315
Just... I wish you
wouldn't say his name.

126
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,161
You don't actually believe
that story, do you?

127
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,288
- No.
- Because he can't hear you.

128
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,357
He doesn't really
take kids that say it.

129
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,426
- I know that.
- Finney.

130
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,227
- I said I know.
- Then say it.

131
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,196
(laughing): No.

132
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:48,689
Are you chicken?

133
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,434
I didn't mean it.

134
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,235
I know.

135
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:58,400
The inner core is solid.
The outer core is molten.

136
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,243
The next layer, called the
mantle, is mostly solid.

137
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,579
However, the thin outer
zone of the mantle

138
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,236
is partially molten.

139
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:08,268
Next slide.

140
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,038
The surface layer
is called the crust.

141
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:14,517
It is solid and very thin.

142
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,458
As the Earth
separated into layers,

143
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:18,604
it began to cool slowly,

144
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,265
but the interior
was still very hot.

145
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,498

155
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,416

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,385

Hey, Finn.

161
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:31,266
What's happening?

162
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,270
You know, just keeping
on keeping on, I guess.

163
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,305
Uh-huh.

164
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,575
Moose got some damn sharp teeth.

165
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,844
Knuckles bled all first period.

166
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,646
Wait.

167
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,150
Fuck with Finn again...

168
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:51,510
I fuck with you.

169
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:57,062
You can leave now.

170
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,934

171
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,402

172
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:06,910
Thank you.

173
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,704
You're gonna have to stand up
for yourself one of these days.

174
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,508
Yeah, I know.

175
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,509
Hey, why'd you fight Moose?

176
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,678
He was just shit-talking.

177
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:18,580
Pretty sure he'd back down.

178
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,348
- Nope.
- (both laugh)

179
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,684
I was so surprised when
he swung, to be honest.

180
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:25,553
I mean, did you have to?

181
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,889
Looked like you really hurt him.

182
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:30,124
I was just gonna
knock his ass down.

183
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:31,392
Whale on him a bit.

184
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,227
But that wouldn't draw no blood.

185
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:37,165
In a situation like that,
the more blood, the better.

187
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,634
It makes a stronger point.

188
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,245
I've seen <i>Texas Chain Saw
Massacre</i> Friday night.

189
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,058
- You seen it?
- That movie's rated R.

190
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,083
My dad would never
take me to see that.

191
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,484
My uncle takes me
to the drive-in.

192
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,067
We see everything.

193
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,027
But, man, that movie...

194
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,482
it's the best ever.

195
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,284
Better than <i>Enter the Dragon?</i>

196
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,440

198

00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:04,459
Yeah. Yeah, you will.

200

201

202
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,467

203
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,369
He doesn't explain it

Detective Miller.

214
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:39,255

216
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:48,302
Is it... is it true you're
friends with Amy Yamada?

217
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,471
We have homeroom together.

218
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,306
Is she okay?

219
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,608
She's fine.

You know what this is about.

221
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:00,415
What did you say to Amy
about her brother Bruce?

222
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:03,451
Just that I had a
dream about him.

223
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,353
What kind of a dream?

224
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,522
Just a weird one.

225
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,424
What happened in your dream?

226
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,293
He was taken. That's all.

227
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:13,287
By a man with black
balloons in a van.

228
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:14,832
Yes.

229
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:16,989
WRIGHT: What else can you
tell us about your dream?

230
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,032
Why? It was just a dream.

231
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,659
MILLER: Who else
knows about the dream?

232
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:21,722
Nobody.

233
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,517
We found two black balloons
at the scene, Gwen.

234
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,561
Oh.

235
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,645
We also found one black
balloon at the scene

236
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,160
of Griffin Stagg's abduction.

237
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,454
And we never released
those details, so...

238
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,199
So the question is, where did
you hear about the balloons?

239
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:38,386
I didn't.

240
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,722
I'm gonna ask you again.

241
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,457
How did you know
about the balloons?

242
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,792
What aren't you
telling us, Gwen?

243
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,769
Either there's a leak in the
department, or...-Or what?

- WRIGHT: No.

245
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,579
You think I kidnapped
Vance Hopper last spring?

246
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:50,732
Is that it?

247
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,459
Vance got held back twice.

248
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:54,319
I've seen him
fight, and trust me,

249
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,780
he could kick the shit out
of either of you blindfolded.

250
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,707
Gwen, watch your language.

251
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:01,568
Yeah, I took him down 'cause
obviously I'm The Grabber,

252

01:15:35,318 --> 01:15:38,433
No, no, no, no,
I'm... I'm listening.

1093
01:15:38,949 --> 01:15:40,351
There's an outlet
in the shitter,

1094
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,743
across from the john.

1095
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:43,545
Yeah, I've seen it.

1096
01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:46,047
On the other side of that
wall, there's a storage room.

1097
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,418
You can't get into that room,

1098
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,845
because there's a big-ass
upright freezer in the way.

1099
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:50,847
Okay.

1100
01:15:50,872 --> 01:15:54,035
Break into the wall about
two feet above the outlet

1101
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,195
till you get to a panel
with screws in it.

1102
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,593
Get the panel off,
you're into the freezer.

1103
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:01,062
And then out into
the storage room.

1104
01:16:01,095 --> 01:16:03,031

I'm not.

Yes, you are.

I can see you.

1145
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,855
That's why he didn't come home.

1146

gonna go like I did.

Do you remember what I told you?

1153
01:20:23,424 --> 01:20:26,594
That I needed to see
<i>Texas Chain Saw Massacre?</i>

1154
01:20:26,627 --> 01:20:28,254
Before that.

1155
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,508
That someday I have to
stand up for myself.

1156
01:20:32,533 --> 01:20:35,152
"Someday" is today, Finn.

1157

Today's the day you stop
taking shit from anybody.

1158
01:20:39,303 --> 01:20:41,138
I'm not a fighter
like you, Robin.

1159
01:20:41,163 --> 01:20:42,365
You couldn't even take him.

1160
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,492
You've always been
a fighter, Finn.

1161
01:20:44,517 --> 01:20:47,353
That's what we have in
common, why we were friends.

1162
01:20:47,615 --> 01:20:49,484
You were always afraid
to throw a punch,

1163
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:51,486
but you always knew
how to take one.

1164
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:55,456
And you always got
back up every time.

1165
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:57,019
I'm not strong enough.

1166
01:20:57,044 --> 01:20:59,393
You have to be. You're
getting out of here.

1167
01:20:59,427 --> 01:21:01,662
If you can't do it
for you, do it for me.

1168
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,168
What does it matter?

1169
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:05,062
Because I don't want
to die for nothing.

1170
01:21:05,087 --> 01:21:07,189
I want to at least
have died for a friend.

1171
01:21:07,314 --> 01:21:09,249
And because I can't
kill that <i>hijo de puta,</i>

1172
01:21:09,274 --> 01:21:11,243
you have to do it for me.

1173
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,199
How?

1174
01:21:14,729 --> 01:21:16,731
You're gonna use a weapon.

1175
01:21:16,756 --> 01:21:18,357
What weapon?

1176
01:21:18,382 --> 01:21:20,214
The one in your hand.

1177
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:21,627
The phone?

1178
01:21:21,816 --> 01:21:23,751
Fill the receiver with dirt.

1179
01:21:23,785 --> 01:21:25,300
Pack it in tight.

1180
01:21:25,325 --> 01:21:26,627
Give it some heft.

1181
01:21:26,652 --> 01:21:28,175
Then what?

1182
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,236
Then you practice over and over.

1183
01:21:31,363 --> 01:21:33,929
You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

1184
01:21:33,962 --> 01:21:37,379
Step forward, step
back and swing.

1185
01:21:37,571 --> 01:21:39,273
- Try it.
- Now?

1186
01:21:39,298 --> 01:21:40,633
Yes.

1187
01:21:40,658 --> 01:21:43,261
You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

1188
01:21:43,286 --> 01:21:46,289
Step forward, step
back and swing.

1189
01:21:46,324 --> 01:21:49,544
Again. You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

1190
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:51,879
Step forward, step
back and swing.

1191
01:21:51,914 --> 01:21:54,816
Again. You raise the phone.
Take a fast step back.

1192
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:57,425
Step forward, step
back and swing.

1193
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:00,688

Take a fast step back.

1194

-Step forward, step back and swing.
-(grunts)

1195
01:22:05,994 --> 01:22:07,636
You got it.

1196
01:22:07,959 --> 01:22:10,427
Now fill the phone with
dirt like I told you.

1197
01:22:10,452 --> 01:22:12,554
Will I still be able
to talk with you?

1198
