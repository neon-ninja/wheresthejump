1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,920
Look alive!

2
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:16,638
Damn it!
Goddamn it!

3
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:19,141
You call that blocking,
you pussy-pukes?

4
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,352
You gotta pick up
the linebacker!

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,806
Goddamn it! Get off the fucking field,
you limp-ass blowdicks!

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,859
Consider yourselves dead
Friday night! Dead!

7
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,033
You gonna rejoin
the living tomorrow, Stan?

8
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:37,535
You've got to feel the pressure
closing in on you!

9
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:39,283
Then you get rid of the rock!

10
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:43,207
Now get focused
or get the fuck off my team!

11
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,256
- Shit!
- Let it go.

12
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,040
This better be important or somebody's
gonna be doing laps until sunrise.

13
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,910
Yeah? What?

14
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:42,723
Please let me finish this
so we can go home. It's late.

15
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:47,727
Mrs Brummel, with all sadness,
no new computers.

16
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:48,888
But...

17
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:52,066
Get the service guy down here
and get the old ones juiced.

18
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,401
Mr Tate,
you're dreaming.

19
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:57,403
Absolutely no field trips
to New York City.

20
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,406
I don't think
that you understand.

21
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:02,492
You're not getting out
of Ohio. Rethink it.

22
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,329
And, finally,
Mrs Olson.

23
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:09,498
There's just no money
for a musical this year.

24
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:14,752
But I bet the football team gets their
new jerseys and their new equipment.

25
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,841
Have you seen the football stadium
on a Friday night, Mr Tate?

26
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:23,803
The entire town is there. This is
a football town, let me remind you,

27
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,181
and, yes, the team will get
new jerseys and new knee pads...

28
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,518
and new jock straps and anything else
they want in the name of education...

29
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:33,353
because that is what
the school board wants.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,522
Because that is what
the parents in this town want.

31
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,527
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,864
My frustrated hands are tied.

33
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:50,539
I don't see why we can't have
a few new computers...

34
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:53,209
so the children will learn
a little set up.

35
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:58,172
Miss Drake, the Drama Club had their
heart set on Guys and Dolls this year.

36
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:03,468
Well... maybe if they use
last year's set from Our Town.

37
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:06,304
Shit, I forgot my keys.
I have to go back.

38
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,431
See you in the morning,
Mrs Olson.

39
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:59,565
Coach Willis.
What can I do for you?

40
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:04,068
You look...
very, very pretty tonight,

41
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:06,570
- Miss Drake.
- Have you been drinking, Coach?

42
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:10,824
I'm sorry to bother you,
but...

43
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:16,287
I can't seem to find a pencil.

44
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:19,623
You don't need a pencil, Coach.
You need a good night's sleep.

45
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,876
- I need a pencil.
- Sleep it off, Coach.

46
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,920
Do you have a pencil?

47
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:29,550
Jesus Christ, yes, I have a pencil.
I have plenty of pencils.

48
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:34,138
Look, why don't you and your pencil
go home. It's late.

49
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:40,772
You look...
very, very pretty tonight.

50
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:44,567
Harassment has a really fine line,
Coach. Haven't you read your handbook?

51
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:54,492
I've always wanted to do that.

52
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,094
Would Miss Drake please report...

53
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,013
to the principal's office?

54
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:50,463
- I forgot my grade book.
- Unlock the door! Coach Willis attacked me!

55
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:53,509
- Unlock the door, goddamn it!
- I don't have my keys.

56
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:56,511
- Let me get help.
- No, don't leave me!

57
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:59,056
- Where are your keys?
- Wait...

58
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,684
In the office.

59
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,729
I'm gonna get my keys now,
Mrs Olson.

60
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:09,815
- Please, let me get help.
- No, just talk to me, okay?

61
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:12,582
Miss Drake...

62
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:14,777
please be careful.

63
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,647
He's insane.

64
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,550
Miss Drake, he's coming!

65
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:41,760
Hurry! Hurry!

66
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,855
Hurry, Miss Drake!
Hurry!

67
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,390
Hurry!

68
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,114
- Shit!
- No!

69
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,274
Hurry!

70
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:10,807
Help me!

71
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:21,416
Prick.

72
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,149
I always wanted to do that.

73
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:38,793
You fucking bitch!

74
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,170
What the hell
were you doing?

75
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:50,221
Whatever.
All right?

76
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,311
Sorry. My fault.

77
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:59,355
Crash and burn, Casey.

78
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:06,321
Get out of the fucking car,
you stupid bitch!

79
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,887
Goddamn you!

80
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,784
- You okay?
- Walk much?

81
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:15,119
You ran into me, beast.

82
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:18,498
Okay, now listen up.
Since we're all wearing the same uniforms,

83
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,499
let's keep
the hair the same.

84
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,918
No hair spray, no teasing,
just elegant.

85
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,212
- Simple. Great.
- Hey.

86
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,798
Stan, watch it. Those are Estee Lauder lips.
Takes 72 minutes to apply.

87
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:31,125
Sorry.

88
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:34,303
- Hey, can we talk?
- I can't right now.

89
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,639
I need a new headline
for the school paper. It's important.

90
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:39,642
- So is this.
- I'm sure you think so, honey.

91
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:44,356
In fact... it could be just the story
you're looking for.

92
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:46,441
Do the words "editor-in-chief"
mean anything to you?

93
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:48,526
Leave the news
to me, okay?

94
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:49,892
Later.

95
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:53,366
That chick weakens legs, meat.

96
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,829
- One, two, three...
- No, not the pole!

97
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,457
Yeah, do it again!

98
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:02,623
Yeah!

99
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,049
Excuse me.

100
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:14,010
Could you please tell me where
the office is? It's my first day here.

101
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:20,432
Thank you.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson.

102
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,686
I really love what you've done with your nose
ring. It brings out the colour in your eyes.

103
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:35,738
You're such a fucking pussy.
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!

104
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:38,908
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

105
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,250
Dude, that's not me.

106
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,501
Doesn't even look like me.

107
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:51,922
It's fifty bucks,
right?

108
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,384
- Does that look like me?
- It's the new you.

109
00:10:56,552 --> 00:11:00,056
I don't know, man. How do we know
these things are even gonna work?

110
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,850
Trust me, man.
I'm brilliant.

111
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,227
Then why are you repeating
your senior year?

112
00:11:06,394 --> 00:11:08,272
All right, look, man.

113
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,648
I'll throw in
a couple hits of this.

114
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:16,654
Scat. My own recipe.
Guaranteed to jack you up.

115
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:25,287
Up the nose, right?

116
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:27,831
Whatever works, man.

117
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:34,585
Fuck.

118
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,968
Excuse me, Mr Tate.

119
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:51,143
Try to remember, Harry,
the projector's got teeth.

120
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,511
Sharp ones.

121
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:56,484
We should be getting hazard pay
for this sort of faulty equipment.

122
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,862
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, good morning, Miss Harper.

123
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,283
I...
I called you this weekend.

124
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:06,118
I got your machine.
How's your cold?

125
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:10,456
- I can't get rid of it.
- Hello. How are you today?

126
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:14,000
A bit tired, but no complaints.

127
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,211
I got it.

128
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:21,467
Can we say,
"retirement"?

129
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,471
Maybe you should just go home.

130
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:28,473
No, thank you.

131
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,809
I'm saving my sick days
for when I feel better.

132
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,815
Maybe I should just put
a pen in my eye.

133
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,699
When will that bitch turn
the air conditioning back on?

134
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,534
Hey, speaking of which,
has anybody seen Principal Drake?

135
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,913
Maybe she had
a sunstroke and died.

136
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:01,673
What's up with the coach?
He's thirsty.

137
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,177
Probably a pregame ritual.

138
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:09,013
Just looking at him
makes me want to take a piss.

139
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,187
Good morning, Mrs Olson.

140
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,275
You look
very, very pretty today.

141
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:39,125
So...
what was Crusoe's...

142
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,126
greatest fear?

143
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,697
Anyone?

144
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:52,304
Yes, Zeke.

145
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,474
Crusoe's afraid that he'd be
stuck on that island forever...

146
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:58,479
with nothing but calluses.

147
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:00,981
No, that's not correct.

148
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,651
Isolation
was his greatest fear.

149
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:06,944
Yes, but...

150
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,446
his external existence
in no way compared...

151
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:13,702
to the internal agony
of the loneliness he felt.

152
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:17,621
That's very good.

153
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:20,291
Like I said, calluses.

154
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,462
So Cathy tells me one thing,
and then Liz says another...

155
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,464
and then, of course,
Jenny's got her own story,

156
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,632
so which one
do you want me to print?

157
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,634
Print them all.
He's a jerk.

158
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,969
- Hey, we need to talk.
- No, Stan, baby, I'm in a crunch.

159
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:35,971
Could we back-burner it?

160
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,974
- I'm quitting football.
- You're not playing tomorrow?

161
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,976
I'm not playing this year.
Would you listen to me?

162
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:46,356
I'm quitting the team.
I'm not playing ball... anymore.

163
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:48,017
What brought this on?

164
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:52,779
Well, I've been weighing
the importance of being a jock...

165
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:56,282
- with my impending future, and I decided...
- You just decided?

166
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:59,451
Stan, what about college? The football
scholarship is your only shot.

167
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:02,082
If I quit now, I can work
harder at studying,

168
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,584
maybe raise
my grades a little.

169
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:08,462
I'd rather go to college...
based on my intellect.

170
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,547
You're not good
at studying.

171
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:12,507
Stan, you're good at football.
Stick to what you're good at.

172
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:17,305
Yeah, I've always been good at football
and basketball and every other sport I try.

173
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:21,141
I think maybe it's time I try something
I'm not so good at, something different.

174
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:24,144
And what am I supposed to do while you're
on a yellow-brick quest for a brain?

175
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:27,439
- What?
- The accepted social order...

176
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:31,359
is head cheerleaders date star
quarterbacks, not academic wanna-bes.

177
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:33,694
Don't be superficial.

178
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,613
"Superficial."
Four syllables.

179
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:38,991
That's really good, Stan.
You're on your way.

180
00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:41,117
Let me know how
the cancer cure goes.

181
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,623
I was hoping you'd be
with me on this.

182
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:04,015
Now, if everyone will turn
to chapter four:

183
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:06,852
"The Nation of the State."

184
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,189
"Only through conformity
among the masses...

185
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:16,194
can the unified state offer the benefits
of power order and security."

186
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:20,366
Actually, we covered that
last week, Mr Tate.

187
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,659
We're on chapter five.

188
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,626
Whatever.

189
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,040
Now if you could all please
join Stan on chapter five:

190
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,085
"Individual Action in Society."

191
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,351
What are you reading?

192
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,312
Double Star.
Robert Heinlein.

193
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,940
You one of those
science fiction people?

194
00:16:56,106 --> 00:17:01,027
Y'all believe in alternate universes
and alien beings and stuff?

195
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:04,658
I'm feeling pretty alien
myself today.

196
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,702
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson
of Atlanta. I'm new here.

197
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,705
- No shit.
- What's your name?

198
00:17:10,872 --> 00:17:12,457
Why do you want
to know my name?

199
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:16,085
'Cause I don't have
any friends.

200
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,547
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem
to have one less than that.

201
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:23,843
- So I just thought... - Stokely, are you
seducing the new students again?

202
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,844
Hi. I'm Delilah.

203
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,097
- Happy to have you at Herrington.
- Thank you.

204
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:32,225
Don't you love the way Stokely accessorizes
different shades of black in her ensemble?

205
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,562
- Fuck you, gutter slut.
- I don't know why you insist...

206
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:36,939
on being such a bad example
for your people.

207
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:40,108
- What people? - I hope you're not a
violent lesbian like your new friend.

208
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,275
No.

209
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:44,987
I'm not aware of any lesbianism
in my lineage.

210
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:47,990
That's too bad, Stokely. You'll just
have to keep looking for Miss Right.

211
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:50,952
Bipolar bitch.

212
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,718
Violent.

213
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Yeah.

214
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:46,089
- What are you doing?
- I was just eating my lunch, sir.

215
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:49,258
This ain't the cafeteria, son.

216
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:52,596
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, sir.

217
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,563
You're...

218
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,560
- I forget your name.
- Casey.

219
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:03,771
Right.
I've seen you around.

220
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,857
You're not really
into sports.

221
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,864
I don't think a person should run
unless he's being chased.

222
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,116
"Being chased."

223
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:15,285
I like that.

224
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,416
Get outta here.

225
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:46,855
- Mrs Brummel, may I have a word with you?
- Certainly.

226
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:59,200
Man, get a fucking eye dog.

227
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:03,038
Maybe if you didn't paint
your fucking eyes shut.

228
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:11,048
- Mr Furlong.
- Present.

229
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:13,050
Found something
on the football field.

230
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,051
Thought you might want
to take a look.

231
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:17,178
- What is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

232
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,181
Want to be
lab partners?

233
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:25,270
I didn't know
you were a lesbian.

234
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:28,105
I don't think
I've ever met one before.

235
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,899
Have you been out long?

236
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,903
I think it's very impressive
and evolved of you...

237
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:36,530
I'm not a lesbian,
all right?

238
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:40,575
Be one. Please.
Fly free.

239
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:44,911
You were right about me. I don't have
any friends, and I like it that way.

240
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,874
- Being a lesbian is just my security.
- Your security against what?

241
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,792
People like you.

242
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,353
Complex.

243
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,634
Certain mesozoan...

244
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,512
only exist in the kidney
of certain squid and octopi.

245
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,017
- Which doesn't make sense because...
- This is Ohio.

246
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,385
Right.

247
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,734
It's a pelagic organism.

248
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,611
- What's pelagic?
- A sea-dwelling organism.

249
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,378
Exactly.

250
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:25,618
But I don't recognize
this surface tissue at all.

251
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,831
Casey, I don't want to blow smoke up your butt,
but I think you found a new species.

252
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:30,457
Yeah, right.

253
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,294
It could happen. New species
are discovered every day.

254
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,713
- Don't be so cynical.
- Could it be gnathostomulida?

255
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:40,508
- No. - They escaped detection
till the mid-20th century.

256
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,426
You just know
everything.

257
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,762
I'm a contradiction.

258
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,972
Check the mesodermic follicles
on its underbelly.

259
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,976
- What does that mean?
- It means we gotta call the university,

260
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:55,813
let them take a look, maybe get in
on some of that federal grant money.

261
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,649
Our secret...
all right?

262
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:03,029
- Hey, Stokely, maybe it's from your planet.
- Blow me, blood fart.

263
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:08,033
Did you see that?

264
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:12,036
What is it doing?

265
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:21,172
- You think it's amphibian?
- Water resuscitated it.

266
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,174
Yeah, but couldn't this kill it?

267
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,175
Yeah, you don't want
to drown it.

268
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,221
- One way to find out.
- Man.

269
00:22:34,142 --> 00:22:35,853
It's all right.

270
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
It's okay.

271
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,199
Mr Furlong,
what are you doing?

272
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm just gonna check
his prostate.

273
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,203
Actually,
the surface texture changed,

274
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,580
so... I want to feel it.

275
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,303
It can replicate.
Jesus.

276
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,684
Fuck!

277
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,220
Goddamn it!

278
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:25,902
- I'm okay.
- It has teeth.

279
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:29,447
Where did it get teeth?

280
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:32,368
I'm gonna call the university.

281
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:47,881
I've just been thinking
ahead, Coach,

282
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:49,248
and...

283
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,887
I've decided
to quit the team...

284
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:57,723
and concentrate
on my academics.

285
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:00,225
Okay.

286
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:04,022
Stan, we'll miss you.

287
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:06,189
That's it?

288
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,567
Well, what do you
want me to say?

289
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:12,071
My star quarterback comes to me the day
before we play Brun County,

290
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:14,907
the only team in the district
that can kick our ass,

291
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:18,079
and tells me
he doesn't want to play.

292
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:20,414
There's something up with that.

293
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:24,084
You seem to be going through
some life-defining turning point,

294
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:27,796
and I'm not gonna stand in the way
of the human condition.

295
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,716
You do what you have to do.

296
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:34,594
Thanks for not reaming me,
Coach.

297
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:38,139
What kind of human being
would I be if I did that?

298
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,319
Hey, give me that back.

299
00:24:56,113 --> 00:24:59,115
Hey, yo, piss wad,
you're in my way.

300
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:01,118
I'm sorry.
I was breathing here.

301
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:06,623
Yeah, that's the problem.
You're occupying my air, you anal probe.

302
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,790
Hey.

303
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:13,421
Yo, Stan.
Tomorrow night, right?

304
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:16,258
That's right.
We'll kill them!

305
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:18,513
We draw blood! Yeah!

306
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:26,811
- It must really blow being you.
- You have no idea.

307
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:11,811
Yo, Casey, is that you?

308
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:22,156
- Mrs Brummel, what the fuck...
- Please.

309
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:25,451
Help me.
I can't breathe.

310
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:28,335
Get help!

311
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:35,794
You don't know what's happening.
They want everyone.

312
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:38,798
It's okay.

313
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,354
Is Mrs Brummel
gonna be okay?

314
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:59,483
Stan, Mrs Brummel has been
diagnosed with cancer,

315
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,569
and she's on a lot
of medication at the moment.

316
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:05,571
It causes
disorientation.

317
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:10,577
We were hoping that she would get through
the school year, but unfortunately it...

318
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:14,080
I hope you can understand
the sensitive nature of the situation.

319
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,246
Yeah.

320
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:18,208
Yeah,
I can keep it quiet.

321
00:27:21,044 --> 00:27:24,634
Casey? You understand?

322
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,177
Casey, you understand?

323
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:32,974
- Casey?
- Yeah.

324
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:35,601
Sure.

325
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,114
- It's Neve Campbell?
- And Jennifer Love Hewitt, right?

326
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:49,616
Yep.
Party of prettiness.

327
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:52,326
- And they're naked?
- Full frontal.

328
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:07,423
Zeke, you cannot conduct
personal business on school property.

329
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:10,843
Well, Miss Burke,
we have a problem...

330
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,596
because I'm sitting on my car
and that's my property.

331
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:17,766
Well, I've had complaints
from several students...

332
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,268
that you've sold them
mind-altering substances.

333
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,854
You want to tell me about it
or take it up with Principal Drake?

334
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:27,279
You're too tense, Miss Burke,
but I've got just the thing for you.

335
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:29,822
You know, Zeke, I'm the authority figure
here. It's time you realized that.

336
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:32,533
"For gentle relief of blockage
caused by dietary stress."

337
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,285
- Chocolate-flavoured laxatives.
- You know...

338
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:37,288
if you applied
just five percent...

339
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:40,541
- of that intellect to your studies,
- Not a chocolate lover?

340
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:43,127
you could have made up
your finals last summer.

341
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:47,005
- You didn't have to repeat your senior year.
- How about these?

342
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:48,771
Condoms.

343
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,760
Magnum-sized,
and they're cherry-flavoured.

344
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:57,556
Come on, Miss Burke.
They're on me.

345
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:01,267
That's so rude.

346
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:13,738
I need a lead story.
I have no page one.

347
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:18,743
Well, we found a new phylum
in Biology. It's bizarre.

348
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,579
Really bizarre. Mr Furlong thinks
it might be a new species.

349
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:24,414
Let me race to the
stands for that issue.

350
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,753
- Why do you rag on me so much? What did I do?
- Nothing.

351
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,922
It's just your fate.
You're that geeky Stephen King kid.

352
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:30,924
There's one of you
in every school.

353
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,092
- We can't go in here.
- Come on, Casey.

354
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:35,135
You're with me.
Be brave.

355
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:41,933
Okay, so what are
we looking for?

356
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,901
Anything.

357
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:54,736
Nurse Harper is medicated.
Big surprise.

358
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:55,904
Hey.

359
00:29:56,905 --> 00:30:00,867
No, I exposed Mr Tate's alcoholism
last year. Nobody cares.

360
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:04,870
Well, his wife certainly didn't
when she ran off with the baby-sitter.

361
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:06,038
God.

362
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:10,125
- You can be such a...
- What?

363
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:16,798
pretty cool human being when you're
not being a first-class, grade-A bitch.

364
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:21,596
You hitting on me, Casey?

365
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:23,163
No. No.

366
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,809
I just think
you can be cool.

367
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:29,814
Sometimes.

368
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:32,900
This not being
one of them.

369
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:01,134
- Where's Brummel?
- She didn't make it.

370
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:03,845
Her body was too old.
The heat got to her.

371
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:07,806
Be careful of the climate.
It compromises your nervous system.

372
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:10,475
It makes one impulsive.

373
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:12,644
Has the entire faculty
been commuted?

374
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:14,211
Almost.

375
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:18,984
- What about the students?
- Soon.

376
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:25,114
What are you two
still doing here?

377
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:27,408
I thought I was
the only left.

378
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:34,458
There are not enough drugs
in this world.

379
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:04,278
What?

380
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,239
I have a pain.

381
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:11,159
Right here.

382
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:25,964
Get off of me! Jesus!

383
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:15,703
Casey!

384
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:19,977
What the hell
is going on?

385
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:26,899
- Slow down there. - Help us.
They killed Mrs Brummel. They're after us.

386
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:28,151
What are you talking about?

387
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:29,652
- Coach Willis.
- And Mrs Olson.

388
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:33,280
- What's going on?
- Ask Nurse Harper, okay? They attacked her.

389
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:35,619
Who attacked who?
What is going on?

390
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:38,746
I have no idea. I joined this right
in the middle of it.

391
00:33:38,913 --> 00:33:41,790
Mrs Brummel wigged out in the shower,
and then we found her body in the faculty closet.

392
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,626
What were you doing
in the faculty closet?

393
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:46,504
- Coach Willis and Mrs Olson attacked
Nurse Harper. - Why would they do that?

394
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,380
There's Nurse Harper.
Just ask her.

395
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:58,098
Now we can get
to the bottom of this.

396
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:00,600
- Fuck.
- Delilah, run!

397
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,439
Delilah, wait!

398
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,602
In here?

399
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:34,965
Yes. The body
was in the closet.

400
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:39,889
- And why would Mrs Brummel be in the closet?
- Because they killed her.

401
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:42,725
- That's right.
- Hey, Casey.

402
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,977
Sorry about that mix-up earlier.
Didn't mean to scare you.

403
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:48,397
Apparently, there's been
a misunderstanding.

404
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,649
Still, if we could just
see inside the closet.

405
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:52,816
Certainly.

406
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:07,414
- It's a doll.
- Meet Resuscitation Annie.

407
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:10,542
We use her to teach C.P.R.
to the students,

408
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,712
although I guess she does
resemble Mrs Brummel slightly.

409
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,923
- You dialled 911 for a dead doll?
- That wasn't there.

410
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:19,925
They put that there.
Look, I'm not making this up.

411
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:22,762
- You gotta call Delilah.
- We called her. She isn't home.

412
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:25,097
She was here with me.
She saw it too.

413
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:27,516
They attacked Nurse Harper.

414
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:31,771
- Nurse Harper is epileptic. She's prone
to grand mals. - She had an attack.

415
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:35,232
Luckily, she carries her medicine in her bag,
so we were able to help her.

416
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:39,113
We think it was brought on by this terrible
cold she's had. I took her home myself.

417
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:42,909
- You can call her if you like.
- It is procedure.

418
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,119
You can use the phone
in my office.

419
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:53,002
That was some fast running
you did down the hall, son.

420
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:57,464
We could sure use your speed.

421
00:35:57,631 --> 00:36:00,633
There's plenty of chasing
on the field.

422
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,261
Did you hear that, Casey?
He said you had speed.

423
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:08,057
- Thank you.
- Good luck in that game tomorrow, Coach.

424
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:14,569
This way.

425
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:26,281
Cas,
what's gotten into you?

426
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:29,617
Evelyn knows someone downtown.
A professional.

427
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:31,337
I'm gonna make an appointment.

428
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:37,625
He's a straight-A student,
and now he needs a professional?

429
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:42,215
- Christ.
- I don't need a shrink. I know what I saw.

430
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,301
Well, we've just spoken...

431
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:47,221
with both Mrs Brummel
and Nurse Harper.

432
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:56,104
- They got him.
- There's nothing here.

433
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:59,482
Just some kid looking
for some attention. Let's go.

434
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,567
All right.

435
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:08,848
Well...

436
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:13,578
I am so sorry,
Miss Drake.

437
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:15,705
Maybe if you and I spoke privately,
we could come up with...

438
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,706
No. No, Mom.
Maybe you're right.

439
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:21,000
Maybe I should see
this woman, this doctor.

440
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:23,003
Can we just go?

441
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,216
We'll take care of this at home, Miss
Drake. Again, sorry for all the trouble.

442
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:29,217
I can see how it all
got out of hand.

443
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:33,304
It's a pretty bizarre
series of events.

444
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:35,848
It's our fault.
It won't happen again.

445
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:38,601
See you tomorrow, Casey.

446
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:47,820
Check his school books.

447
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:50,948
They hide the drugs in the spine
of the book. We saw it on Dateline.

448
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:54,034
- What are you on, son?
- I'm not on drugs.

449
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,661
That's government property, Dad.

450
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:57,787
Shit.

451
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:03,710
Look, we love you, son.
We want to help you.

452
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:08,048
Then believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

453
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:12,384
Something really weird
is happening at school. The teachers...

454
00:38:12,552 --> 00:38:14,721
- Something's happened to them.
- Don't push it, all right?

455
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:18,098
- I'm bending as far as I can, but if
you push it... - Just let me call Delilah.

456
00:38:18,223 --> 00:38:19,623
Please?

457
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:23,217
Okay, that's it.

458
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:25,230
Your privileges
are now over.

459
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:29,943
No phone. Sorry. Over.
No internet.

460
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,406
You'll go to school, straight to school,
and you'll come straight home. You got it?

461
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:39,243
I'm not going back to that school.
They're waiting for me.

462
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:43,292
You'll go. If I have to tie you
to the desk myself, you'll go.

463
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,259
No music.

464
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:47,128
His porno.

465
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:48,495
Porno.

466
00:38:53,426 --> 00:38:56,720
Sorry, pal. No more
flogging the bishop.

467
00:38:56,887 --> 00:39:00,558
We are gonna
get you help. Don't worry.

468
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:03,811
Get your room
cleaned up.

469
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:46,435
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

470
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:48,772
Dad. They're here.

471
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:51,197
The faculty.

472
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:55,757
Get in the house, now.

473
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:59,406
I'm losing it.

474
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:30,183
- Go on, son.
- Dad, I'm begging you.

475
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:31,751
Please.

476
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:34,522
Come home
right after school.

477
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:37,691
Your mom's
looking into a doctor.

478
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,003
Mr Connor.

479
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,833
Delilah.
Wow, you look...

480
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,335
Don't. Come on.

481
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,336
Your attention, please.

482
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:43,463
Will the following students
report to the office:

483
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:46,924
James Archuleta,
Tina Dannhausen,

484
00:41:47,092 --> 00:41:49,430
and Delilah Proffitt.

485
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:51,765
- This is all your fault.
- What do you mean?

486
00:41:51,932 --> 00:41:53,850
Do you think I'm in drag
for the aesthetics?

487
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:55,852
They're after me.

488
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,146
- Did you tell your parents?
- My mom didn't believe me.

489
00:41:58,313 --> 00:42:00,273
She drinks.
It was a nightmare.

490
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:02,275
- Look, we have to go to the police.
- No.

491
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:04,695
- They've got the police.
- We don't know what they've got.

492
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:07,364
Look, you saw it.
Mrs Brummel was dead.

493
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:09,699
- They attacked Nurse Harper.
- "They"? Who are "they"?

494
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:12,451
Casey, we don't even know
who "they" are.

495
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:14,454
Why did she act
like everything was okay?

496
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:16,455
It's a devil's cult
or something.

497
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:18,707
Maybe they worship comets.
Who the fuck knows?

498
00:42:18,874 --> 00:42:20,709
I'm not gonna stay in a handicapped
bathroom for the rest of my life.

499
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,418
- They couldn't have gotten to everyone.
- Where are you going?

500
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:25,963
- I'm going to find Stan.
- Stan? Why Stan?

501
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,796
Will the following students
please report to the office:

502
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:10,549
Jennifer Qulick,
Randy Knotson and Thomas Nicks.

503
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,551
You should just
go talk to him.

504
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:14,117
No way.

505
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:19,350
I'm sorry.

506
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,520
So you... Are you ready
for the big game?

507
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:27,731
I quit the team.

508
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:31,818
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

509
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:32,986
Why?

510
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:42,412
Just tired of everyone kissing my ass
'cause I'm captain of the football team.

511
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:48,167
You know... the coach, the students,
even the teachers.

512
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,753
Last year after we won
the 2A Conference...

513
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,133
That was thanks to you
and your completed passes.

514
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,344
You follow the games?

515
00:43:56,512 --> 00:44:00,015
I wouldn't
have guessed that.

516
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,392
I made a "D" on a biology test
right after,

517
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,186
and Mr Furlong
changed it to an "A."

518
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,398
He said I deserved
for having such a strong arm.

519
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,568
That really bugged me,
you know?

520
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:16,989
I worked hard for that "D."
That was my "D." I deserved that "D."

521
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,368
I just wish people
would let me be, you know...

522
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:24,371
A "D" student.

523
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,537
Yeah.

524
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,759
Okay, class, listen up.

525
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,596
Today we are going to write
a living family history.

526
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,349
Everyone take out a piece of paper
and write down the name...

527
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,435
of every living member
of your family.

528
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:52,105
Begin with your immediate family...
those living with you...

529
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,569
then include the names
of your nearest living relatives.

530
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:56,736
What?

531
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:02,951
- Is this gonna be on the test?
- This is the test.

532
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,748
What is that?

533
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,879
It's magic dust.

534
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,715
- You want some?
- No, I have a low tolerance, but thank you.

535
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,718
- You sure?
- I'm allergic to aspirin,

536
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:24,595
so that would
probably kill me.

537
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,349
- We wouldn't want to do that.
- No.

538
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:32,102
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson
of Atlanta.

539
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,646
Atlanta.
I know.

540
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:37,064
That's right.
You know everything.

541
00:45:37,232 --> 00:45:39,032
I'm Zeke.

542
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:41,903
- I know.
- It's a pleasure.

543
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,239
The pleasure's
all mine.

544
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:50,077
There's a mandatory meeting in the office
at lunch today for all club presidents.

545
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:52,914
Remember, tonight we take on
the Brun County Changa.

546
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:56,208
- Please come at 5:30 and show your support.
- Hey, that's mine.

547
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:00,423
Weird, isn't it?

548
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,134
- What do you think it is?
- Locker search maybe?

549
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:07,054
Something weird
is going on here.

550
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,402
Hey, Football.

551
00:46:22,569 --> 00:46:24,569
Hey, Gabe.

552
00:46:25,237 --> 00:46:28,573
- You're not pissed, are you?
- About what?

553
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:30,367
I'm the new team captain.

554
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:40,209
What's going on here?

555
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:44,422
Nurse Harper, she's giving an ear exam
or some shit like that.

556
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:46,507
And that takes the police?

557
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:50,594
Stan, I need
to talk to you.

558
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:52,595
I didn't know
you wore glasses.

559
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:55,182
Contacts.
Come on, it's important.

560
00:46:59,772 --> 00:47:02,357
Stokely, got a second?
I need your help.

561
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:09,572
So after the accident, I came here
to live with relatives, you know.

562
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:15,412
So I moved in
with my cousins and... here I am.

563
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:19,749
Fucking do something,
you pussy puke!

564
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:21,752
Yeah, my mom and dad
are dead too.

565
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:24,587
- Really?
- Yeah.

566
00:47:24,712 --> 00:47:27,881
They're still breathing,
but for all intents and purposes,

567
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:30,050
they're very much dead.

568
00:47:32,303 --> 00:47:35,180
You've fucking gone weird.
Fuck you, you pussy.

569
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:38,516
- Fuck you!
- You and I have a lot in common then.

570
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:43,102
Yeah.

571
00:47:44,772 --> 00:47:48,859
- You notice anything off today here at school?
- I'm from the south.

572
00:47:49,026 --> 00:47:51,570
- Y'all are off.
- Dude, we need some scat.

573
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:53,738
Yeah, man, we can't deal.
There's some weird shit going down here.

574
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:58,242
Five bucks a pop. Hey, man,
how's the new you working out?

575
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,332
Working out just fine.

576
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:03,500
Hey, you got any more?

577
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:05,585
- Sure, man.
- Really?

578
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:09,630
Why don't you give us
all you got?

579
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:12,175
All right.
Dough.

580
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:16,721
- You got any more?
- Not on me, man.

581
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:20,766
- What about in your locker?
- How about in your car? Got any more there?

582
00:48:23,185 --> 00:48:26,689
- Use in moderation, boys.
- Come on, Zeke. Hook us up.

583
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:30,067
- Check out Miss Burke.
- Wow, what happened to her?

584
00:48:30,234 --> 00:48:35,780
Man, I'm really not in the mood,
Miss Burke. I'm clean.

585
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,033
- What's up with her?
- Not today.

586
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,994
It's too damn hot, and I got
zero-fucking-tolerance.

587
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:47,833
Eat me, you asshole. I'm the one with
no tolerance, you pathetic little runt.

588
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,878
Ouch. Comeback.

589
00:48:51,045 --> 00:48:52,963
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call my mother?

590
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,715
And how am I supposed to do
that, little Zekey boy?

591
00:48:55,882 --> 00:48:57,883
Do you even know
where she is?

592
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:03,017
Europe, Sri Lanka, Japan? I wonder what
remote location she went to this week...

593
00:49:03,184 --> 00:49:07,438
to hide from her
great big bastard mistake.

594
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:09,689
I've taken your shit
for too fucking long,

595
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:12,650
you dickless drug-induced
excuse for a human being.

596
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,778
- Woman, what are you on?
- "Woman"? Did you just say, "woman"?

597
00:49:15,945 --> 00:49:18,198
I'm sick of you,
little boy.

598
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:21,868
And if I see you peddling
your wonder dust again,

599
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:25,496
I'm gonna shove my foot
so far up your ass...

600
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,914
you'll be sucking my toes
till graduation.

601
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:33,153
Big trouble.

602
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,756
She got some bad shit.

603
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:42,304
And then they chased us,
but we got away.

604
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:44,889
All this started when Mrs Brummel
did a wet and wild...

605
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:47,600
- in the boys' locker room?
- I think so.

606
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:52,896
Everybody's been acting really strange,
especially the faculty.

607
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:55,942
Tell me about it. It's like they've
all turned into fucking pod people...

608
00:49:56,108 --> 00:49:57,443
- or something.
- Into what people?

609
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:03,197
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A small town was taken over by aliens.

610
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:04,743
That was a joke.

611
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:07,246
Look, what if it
really happened?

612
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:11,208
- What if that really happened?
- I think something's taking over our school.

613
00:50:11,374 --> 00:50:14,043
The Body Snatchers is a story
somebody made up, dingus.

614
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:16,045
It's located in the fiction
section of the library.

615
00:50:16,212 --> 00:50:20,091
So is Schindler's List. All fiction
is based on some truth, right?

616
00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:22,802
What does Miss Burke teach us
in English 101? Write what you know.

617
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,804
How do we know
this writer guy...

618
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:26,639
- Jack Finney.
- didn't encounter aliens in his high school...

619
00:50:26,805 --> 00:50:29,808
which led him to write a book
about an alien invasion?

620
00:50:29,976 --> 00:50:32,144
- Your conspiracy theory is flawed.
- How so?

621
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:34,771
Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers
is a blatant rip-off...

622
00:50:34,938 --> 00:50:36,773
of The Puppet Masters
by Robert Heinlein.

623
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:39,108
So you can completely disregard
that entire work.

624
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:41,193
Whatever.
The point is they're here,

625
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,194
they've been here
and they're here again.

626
00:50:43,362 --> 00:50:46,073
You know, Casey, I think you've been racked
into the flagpole one too many times.

627
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:47,782
Look, how do you know
there's not a conspiracy?

628
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,867
Maybe X-Files is right.

629
00:50:50,034 --> 00:50:52,620
Where do all these movies
come from anyway?

630
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:55,248
How do we know Spielberg,
Lucas, Sonnenfeld,

631
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:58,126
Emmerich haven't been
visited by aliens?

632
00:50:58,293 --> 00:51:00,128
You know, maybe they're
aliens themselves.

633
00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:02,589
Maybe they're simply preparing us
for what's to come.

634
00:51:02,756 --> 00:51:04,757
You know what, Casey,
it's fiction. Okay?

635
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:06,887
- It's science fiction.
- Exactly.

636
00:51:07,054 --> 00:51:09,931
Everybody gets hung up on the science
part, which has nothing to do with it.

637
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,142
They're getting at us
through the fiction.

638
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:15,019
So, aliens have just been
setting us up over the years,

639
00:51:15,186 --> 00:51:17,104
creating this happy little
make-believe existence...

640
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:19,106
with their E.T.
and their Men In Black movies...

641
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:21,776
just so that nobody would believe it
if it really happened?

642
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:25,029
I think so.
Yeah.

643
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,158
- You're not buying this, are you?
- No, I'm not.

644
00:51:30,325 --> 00:51:33,828
But it's kind of cool.

645
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:35,747
Okay, so what's missing?

646
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:39,458
Well, in The Body Snatchers,
they were pods, but where are they?

647
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,460
I mean, where are the pods?

648
00:51:41,627 --> 00:51:43,878
There are no pods.

649
00:51:44,045 --> 00:51:46,923
There's gotta be
something else.

650
00:51:48,383 --> 00:51:50,760
In Puppet Masters,
they were parasites.

651
00:51:56,724 --> 00:52:00,185
- I filled Stan in.
- Come with us. Stokely's onto something.

652
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:01,753
Really?

653
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:05,106
Shit.

654
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:10,781
Furlong must have sent it
up to the university.

655
00:52:10,906 --> 00:52:14,033
- Doubtful.
- Where else could it be?

656
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:17,779
What? What is it?

657
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,167
Will someone please tell me
what the hell's going on here?

658
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:26,838
It all started yesterday when
I found this thing, this new species.

659
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:28,882
Which is now missing.

660
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:36,222
We think aliens are
taking over our school.

661
00:52:39,392 --> 00:52:41,727
Right. Come on.

662
00:52:41,894 --> 00:52:43,228
You saw what Brummel
did in the shower.

663
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:46,064
I saw her dead body
in the closet.

664
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:49,900
They've been calling students into the office.
The students with the most influence on down,

665
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:52,236
including the new team captain.

666
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,238
Looks like you picked
the right week to quit football.

667
00:52:54,406 --> 00:52:56,241
You think aliens have
infested our school?

668
00:52:57,867 --> 00:53:01,203
That would explain their weird
behaviour, wouldn't it?

669
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,413
Give me a fucking break.

670
00:53:13,884 --> 00:53:16,010
So, what are we
doing in here?

671
00:53:16,178 --> 00:53:17,978
Shopping.

672
00:53:19,472 --> 00:53:23,726
- I've got a very large grocery list.
- What are you talking about?

673
00:53:23,892 --> 00:53:25,895
This is where
I get my equipment.

674
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:28,063
You borrow it
from science labs?

675
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:30,650
I like to think of it
as stealing, actually.

676
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:36,322
Just doing my part to the
deconstruction of America.

677
00:53:41,077 --> 00:53:44,163
So if anybody
finds us in here,

678
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:46,331
just grab ahold of me and pretend
we're making out.

679
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:49,041
The punishment
will be less severe.

680
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:07,308
- Aliens?
- Do you have a better explanation, Stan?

681
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:11,858
Great. Just listen to yourselves.
Our teachers are aliens?

682
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:14,902
That's not weird,
that's fucking psychotic.

683
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:17,321
Come on, guys.
This is nuts.

684
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,823
Then leave, Stan. Why are you
hanging around? Go win a Pulitzer.

685
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:22,076
Blow me, Delilah,
'cause I'm sick of your shit.

686
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:24,380
Get the fuck out of here
and take your freak dyke with you.

687
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,542
Fuck you, tit bags.

688
00:54:25,672 --> 00:54:28,623
- Will everybody calm down, please?
- All right, Casey.

689
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:33,711
Let's go alien for a second.
Why here?

690
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:35,679
Why Ohio?

691
00:54:36,047 --> 00:54:38,049
If you were going
to take over the world,

692
00:54:38,215 --> 00:54:40,676
would you blow up the White House
Independence Day style...

693
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:44,137
or sneak in
through the backdoor?

694
00:54:54,397 --> 00:54:55,597
Casey.

695
00:54:56,398 --> 00:55:00,611
Man, the only person
in this school who is an alien...

696
00:55:00,779 --> 00:55:02,655
is you, man.

697
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:04,342
Fuck you, Zeke.

698
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:08,785
What's going on here?

699
00:55:11,163 --> 00:55:13,540
Shouldn't you people
be in class?

700
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,046
Well, it's like this,
Mr Furlong,

701
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,924
Casey here
thinks you're an alien.

702
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:28,806
- Really?
- The whole faculty, actually.

703
00:55:30,392 --> 00:55:32,227
Is that true?

704
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:37,097
Casey?

705
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:42,903
The thing I found yesterday...
Where is it?

706
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,238
I sent it to the university.

707
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:48,157
Do they know what it is?

708
00:55:51,452 --> 00:55:55,247
Look, sorry to impose and
disrupt, Mr Furlong, but...

709
00:55:55,414 --> 00:55:58,374
If you'd kindly take your seats,
this will be over quite quickly.

710
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:00,669
Now sit down!

711
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:13,931
- Put him the fuck down, Furlong.
- This is for the best, Zeke.

712
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:19,888
Goddamn it!

713
00:56:20,149 --> 00:56:21,749
Come on.

714
00:56:22,234 --> 00:56:23,234
No!

715
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:15,229
Zeke.

716
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:30,799
This is usually the point where somebody
says, "Let's get the fuck outta here."

717
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:33,053
Let's get the fuck outta here.

718
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:40,600
Aliens are taking over
the fucking school.

719
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:45,772
We gotta have proof.

720
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:49,233
All right, everybody,
here's the deal.

721
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,568
We're heading straight
for the parking lot.

722
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:54,696
Pull it together,
and try to stay calm.

723
00:58:29,397 --> 00:58:30,997
Stokely.

724
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:37,822
What's Stan hanging out
with those guys for?

725
00:58:46,747 --> 00:58:48,347
Delilah.

726
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:05,830
My car.

727
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,352
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

728
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:12,562
Wait.
Stan!

729
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,566
- There he is. Let's go.
- Where you going, buddy?

730
00:59:15,733 --> 00:59:18,068
- We're going to...
- Come on, Stan. Jesus Christ.

731
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:20,445
- Get in the fucking car.
- Sure you don't want to play with us?

732
00:59:20,611 --> 00:59:23,534
Nah, Gabe... but thanks.

733
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:38,173
What the fuck is going on?

734
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,426
Let's see if anybody's talking.

735
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:49,892
Who the fuck are these guys?

736
00:59:50,058 --> 00:59:52,269
All right,
pull over here, fellas.

737
00:59:52,436 --> 00:59:56,481
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey!

738
01:00:26,178 --> 01:00:28,972
- Where's your mom and dad?
- Europe, I think.

739
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,060
Shit.

740
01:00:37,772 --> 01:00:41,484
- My God.
- This is some serious shit.

741
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,286
This is your big secret?
Caffeine pills?

742
01:00:53,453 --> 01:00:55,580
You didn't see that.

743
01:00:55,748 --> 01:00:59,084
What are we gonna do with
the police not being an option?

744
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,502
I can call my dad.
He'd know what to do.

745
01:01:01,669 --> 01:01:03,712
If he's even
your dad anymore.

746
01:01:09,636 --> 01:01:11,679
It's called a gun, man.

747
01:01:22,606 --> 01:01:24,691
What is it?

748
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:28,739
We're gonna find out.

749
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:32,534
Hey, come here, Oscar.

750
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:35,036
Come here, buddy.

751
01:01:51,635 --> 01:01:52,635
Jeez.

752
01:02:07,565 --> 01:02:09,365
Now what?

753
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:12,153
I'm sorry, buddy.

754
01:02:35,511 --> 01:02:38,514
See? It's a parasite.

755
01:02:38,682 --> 01:02:42,811
It attaches itself to a host,
and then it controls it.

756
01:02:49,024 --> 01:02:52,026
- It's incomplete.
- What do you mean?

757
01:02:52,194 --> 01:02:55,197
It can survive on its own, but it's
really part of a greater organism.

758
01:02:55,363 --> 01:02:58,866
Look, it has the ability to replicate,
but it needs a host.

759
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:00,909
Something moist.

760
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:03,912
See what it did to Oscar's insides.
It dried them out.

761
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,748
Hey, isn't a human body
composed mainly of water?

762
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:07,958
They're using us.

763
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,210
- Drying us out.
- Like Mrs Brummel, right?

764
01:03:10,376 --> 01:03:12,044
I overheard the coach.

765
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:14,047
Her body was too old.
She didn't take.

766
01:03:14,214 --> 01:03:16,132
See, this partially explains
what happened to Furlong.

767
01:03:21,387 --> 01:03:26,057
That drug's a diuretic.
Dries it out. Kills it.

768
01:03:26,224 --> 01:03:28,938
They're using us as hosts. They're just
turning us into mindless slaves...

769
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:32,191
- they can control.
- How do you know that?

770
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:35,110
She doesn't.
She's a Trekkie sci-fi freak.

771
01:03:35,277 --> 01:03:37,696
Who's been right so far.

772
01:03:37,862 --> 01:03:39,822
How do we stop it?

773
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:43,117
Yeah, Stokely,
this is your area.

774
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:47,831
In theory,
they're all connected.

775
01:03:47,997 --> 01:03:51,042
- If we kill the master, we get them all.
- "In theory."

776
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:53,211
What happens to everybody else?

777
01:03:53,378 --> 01:03:55,880
The ones who've been taken over?
Do they just die?

778
01:03:56,048 --> 01:03:58,758
No, they don't.
They would become human again.

779
01:03:58,925 --> 01:04:01,510
But that is
in theory, so...

780
01:04:01,677 --> 01:04:03,970
So if we found the leader
and killed it,

781
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:06,806
- we'd beat it.
- What are we even talking about?

782
01:04:06,974 --> 01:04:09,059
- I say we get the fuck out of town.
- And go where?

783
01:04:09,226 --> 01:04:12,645
Don't you see? We got to stop it
or it's gonna spread.

784
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,022
It took the high school
in a day and a half.

785
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:18,526
Give it a week,
we'll never outrun it.

786
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:21,236
- We have to fight.
- Fight what?

787
01:04:21,404 --> 01:04:24,156
We don't even know
who's alien and who's not.

788
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:26,867
What if one of us was an alien
right now? How would we know?

789
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:30,161
He's right. How do I know
you're really Casey?

790
01:04:30,328 --> 01:04:32,041
How do I know
you're really you?

791
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:35,295
In Body Snatchers,
humans became emotionless.

792
01:04:35,462 --> 01:04:38,589
- They completely lost their identities.
- The coach had emotion.

793
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:41,675
I mean, he's usually a real hard-ass,
but he was different somehow.

794
01:04:41,842 --> 01:04:44,094
His behaviour
was slightly odd.

795
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:47,180
Like a star quarterback who mysteriously
quits the football team?

796
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:49,183
What are you doing, Delilah?

797
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,185
I'm just pointing out
your "slightly odd" behaviour, Stan.

798
01:04:51,351 --> 01:04:53,895
You've been acting really weird
the last couple of days.

799
01:04:54,062 --> 01:04:57,189
I'm not an alien,
I'm discontent.

800
01:04:57,357 --> 01:05:00,526
- There's another big word.
- You want to talk slightly odd?

801
01:05:00,693 --> 01:05:02,611
What about you? You haven't been
without your contacts...

802
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:04,530
or hair spray
since birth.

803
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:08,241
- I'm incognito.
- We just have to trust each other.

804
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:12,453
And I'm supposed to trust you? Tell me something,
Miss Lesbian, when did you start liking boys?

805
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:15,582
- What the fuck you talking about?
- I see the way you look at Stan.

806
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:18,919
So when did you stop
muff-diving?

807
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:20,545
She's not a lesbian.
That was a hoax.

808
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:22,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

809
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:25,592
And what about you,
Miss Atlanta?

810
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:29,303
It's just really convenient that you showed up
the second all these things started happening.

811
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,560
- What are you doing in Ohio anyway?
- It's not my fault.

812
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:35,978
Hey, shut up.

813
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:38,148
She's got a point, Zeke.

814
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:42,026
Yeah, Zeke, Professor.

815
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:45,403
I mean, you seem to know an awful lot
about this stuff.

816
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:49,658
No offence, but you're not exactly known
for your academic achievements.

817
01:05:49,825 --> 01:05:52,244
Neither are you, man.

818
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:56,497
- Casey, when did you become Sigourney Weaver?
- Wha...

819
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:58,874
All right,
this is getting us nowhere.

820
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,930
I got a solution.

821
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:19,435
We know this outs them, right?
Take a hit.

822
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:23,188
No way, man.
I don't do drugs.

823
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:27,109
Come on, man. If you're not an alien,
you got nothing to worry about.

824
01:06:27,277 --> 01:06:29,612
Zeke's right.

825
01:06:29,779 --> 01:06:32,656
This is the only way
to know for sure.

826
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,161
Yeah, come on, Stan.
What are you afraid of, man?

827
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:37,621
Look, we all do it.

828
01:06:42,626 --> 01:06:45,796
- Casey.
- Why me first?

829
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:47,714
It's your birthright, man.
Just fucking take it.

830
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:03,537
Easy, boy.

831
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:14,279
What about you, Zeke? How do we know
you're not one of those fucking things?

832
01:07:17,365 --> 01:07:19,534
I don't get high
on my own stash, man.

833
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:21,495
Fuck that, man!
You're taking it.

834
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:24,665
You're taking it.

835
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:31,020
Now what the hell's wrong with him?

836
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:33,619
Nothing's wrong with him,
you asshole.

837
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:34,924
He's tweaking.
Let him fucking tweak!

838
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:39,514
Tweak. Tweak.

839
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,281
Now you.

840
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,282
Your turn.

841
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,820
Stokely.

842
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:28,393
I'm not putting that hack drug
up my nose.

843
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,063
- It's so '80s.
- Aliens are taking over the Earth. Weigh it.

844
01:08:35,566 --> 01:08:39,406
- What's in it?
- Mostly caffeine. Some other household shit.

845
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:48,079
Shit.

846
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,711
Now you,
Delilah.

847
01:08:56,213 --> 01:08:59,013
No. Her first.

848
01:09:01,301 --> 01:09:04,346
- I'm allergic.
- Yeah, and I'm Portuguese. Who cares?

849
01:09:08,099 --> 01:09:10,393
Is she always this much fun, man?

850
01:09:10,559 --> 01:09:13,603
Sometimes she can be a real bitch.

851
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:20,026
You know what I'm saying? You know?

852
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:27,868
You both take it.

853
01:09:28,035 --> 01:09:30,787
Zeke, I can't.
You know, I can't.

854
01:09:33,872 --> 01:09:35,707
You have to take it.

855
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:45,811
Showdown.

856
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,030
Del?

857
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:16,605
Shit!

858
01:10:26,216 --> 01:10:28,885
Shoot her. Shoot her
in the head, Casey.

859
01:10:29,011 --> 01:10:31,596
- Stan, I don't know what's happening.
- Shoot her, Casey.

860
01:10:31,764 --> 01:10:35,517
- Don't shoot her, Casey. - Shoot her, Casey.
She's fucking one of them, man!

861
01:10:35,684 --> 01:10:38,561
There's nowhere to go.

862
01:10:38,728 --> 01:10:40,020
Nowhere to hide.
We're everywhere.

863
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:42,650
I'll fucking shoot her.

864
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:45,478
Shit!

865
01:10:52,117 --> 01:10:53,317
Jesus!

866
01:10:57,874 --> 01:10:59,474
Get her!

867
01:11:01,317 --> 01:11:02,419
She's getting away!

868
01:11:02,586 --> 01:11:05,797
- Hurry!
- Shit!

869
01:11:12,178 --> 01:11:15,389
I should have known that
crazy bitch was one of them.

870
01:11:15,555 --> 01:11:17,432
We can get her back, Zeke.

871
01:11:17,599 --> 01:11:19,559
We can get them all back.

872
01:11:22,526 --> 01:11:24,309
She destroyed most of my supply.

873
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,152
Look, if we kill the queen,
we can get them all back.

874
01:11:33,072 --> 01:11:34,072
Fuck!

875
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:45,795
- How much do we have left?
- Not much.

876
01:11:45,963 --> 01:11:47,922
But we only need enough
to get the queen.

877
01:11:48,089 --> 01:11:50,883
- We get her, we get them all, right?
- I think so.

878
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:55,929
- Where are we gonna find her?
- Friday night? Only one place she can be.

879
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:10,153
Go Hornets!

880
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:18,200
He crosses the field!
Eludes the tacklers!

881
01:12:18,366 --> 01:12:21,619
Tackled by four Hornets
with authority.

882
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:32,296
Somebody stung
by the Hornets!

883
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:42,972
Come on, ladies!
Let's play four quarters!

884
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:44,639
Jesus.

885
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,319
Get in there
and take his fucking head off.

886
01:12:58,364 --> 01:12:59,782
Kill! Kill!

887
01:13:10,584 --> 01:13:11,584
Kill!

888
01:13:22,178 --> 01:13:24,263
- You think it's Principal Drake?
- Who else?

889
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:27,224
She's in charge.
It would make perfect sense.

890
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:33,856
They're getting everybody.
I mean, the whole town is here.

891
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:37,942
By morning, there won't be
a human left.

892
01:13:50,498 --> 01:13:52,098
Come on.

893
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,813
Where are you guys?

894
01:14:15,021 --> 01:14:17,857
We found Drake.
She's at the game.

895
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:20,025
What are you kids
doing in here?

896
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:28,950
The gym is closed.
All of you come with me.

897
01:14:30,952 --> 01:14:32,787
We can't do that,
Miss Drake.

898
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:37,107
Why is that?

899
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:40,461
Get her.

900
01:14:40,628 --> 01:14:42,755
Quick, Zeke, get the doors!

901
01:14:44,924 --> 01:14:48,177
Get me out!
You're all expelled!

902
01:14:48,344 --> 01:14:51,767
- Stop the act. No one's buying it.
- We know who you are.

903
01:14:53,268 --> 01:14:56,521
You're in a lot of trouble.

904
01:14:58,482 --> 01:14:59,774
What are you doing?

905
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:05,070
- You ready?
- Yep.

906
01:15:07,073 --> 01:15:09,273
Sniff this.

907
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:12,994
- No.
- Sniff it or he shoots you.

908
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,320
I will not.

909
01:15:16,373 --> 01:15:18,173
Now what?

910
01:15:25,339 --> 01:15:27,174
We do it the hard way.

911
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:31,220
With Mr Furlong, we plunged it into his
eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.

912
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:34,181
You stick her, and then I'll shoot her
before it erupts all over the place.

913
01:15:34,347 --> 01:15:35,974
Casey, are you on drugs?

914
01:15:39,395 --> 01:15:42,314
- What's wrong?
- Are we sure?

915
01:15:42,481 --> 01:15:44,524
Please don't, Casey!

916
01:15:44,691 --> 01:15:46,651
Don't wuss out, Casey!
Just do it!

917
01:16:01,626 --> 01:16:03,461
What if we were wrong?

918
01:16:05,588 --> 01:16:08,049
Stab it
and find out.

919
01:16:19,434 --> 01:16:22,269
I think we made a mistake, guys.

920
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:25,971
She's dead.

921
01:16:32,987 --> 01:16:33,987
Easy!

922
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,330
Is that it?

923
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:59,349
Let's see if it worked.

924
01:17:14,237 --> 01:17:16,072
It better have worked,

925
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,824
or there are gonna be
a lot of infected people going home.

926
01:17:18,992 --> 01:17:22,036
We're right at ground zero.

927
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,375
You guys stay here.
I'll go check it out.

928
01:17:30,627 --> 01:17:32,962
I'm gonna need some scat.

929
01:17:34,547 --> 01:17:36,549
Use it wisely, man.

930
01:17:42,638 --> 01:17:44,257
What if it wasn't Drake?

931
01:17:45,725 --> 01:17:47,559
Then we're fucked.

932
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,119
I just don't want
to never have done that.

933
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,091
What are you looking at?

934
01:18:30,268 --> 01:18:31,468
Coach.

935
01:18:50,746 --> 01:18:53,289
Jesus, I wish I'd never come here.
I don't like this place.

936
01:18:53,456 --> 01:18:55,791
Any sign of him?

937
01:18:58,338 --> 01:19:00,965
I can't tell.
I can barely see anything.

938
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:03,802
Quick, Stokely,
open the door.

939
01:19:03,927 --> 01:19:05,928
No, Stokely! We don't know
if it's still him.

940
01:19:06,095 --> 01:19:08,097
No, it's me.
Listen, it wasn't Drake.

941
01:19:08,263 --> 01:19:10,474
It's the coach,
and he's right after me. Open the door.

942
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,018
Don't do it, Stoke.
Prove it, Stan. Where's the drug?

943
01:19:13,186 --> 01:19:17,064
I lost it. The coach was too fast for me.
Please, Stokely, don't leave me out here.

944
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:21,277
- Last one, man. - Please, I'm begging you!
Don't leave me out here!

945
01:19:21,444 --> 01:19:23,904
- Come on, Stokely. Open the door.
- There, try it.

946
01:19:24,071 --> 01:19:26,114
Okay, I'll do it. I'll...
Just let me do it inside.

947
01:19:26,282 --> 01:19:28,408
Do it right now, man.

948
01:19:28,534 --> 01:19:30,744
- Take the test, man.
- Stan, take the drug, man. Prove it to us.

949
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:31,910
Okay.

950
01:19:45,257 --> 01:19:46,257
Fuck!

951
01:19:47,676 --> 01:19:48,676
Fuck!

952
01:19:51,138 --> 01:19:53,598
Open the door.

953
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:57,059
It is so much better.

954
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:59,649
There's no fear...
or pain.

955
01:19:59,774 --> 01:20:02,192
It's beautiful.

956
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:05,903
And you will be beautiful.

957
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:07,823
You'll be beautiful.

958
01:20:07,989 --> 01:20:11,534
No problems or worries.

959
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:14,101
We want you.

960
01:20:15,038 --> 01:20:17,238
I want you.

961
01:20:17,457 --> 01:20:19,657
I want you.

962
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:22,336
Now open the fucking door!

963
01:20:22,503 --> 01:20:24,338
- Open the door!
- Come away.

964
01:20:24,505 --> 01:20:26,940
Go a-fucking-way, Stan!

965
01:20:27,507 --> 01:20:31,302
It's too late, Stokely.
We've already won.

966
01:20:31,469 --> 01:20:33,388
No pain, Stan?

967
01:20:33,554 --> 01:20:36,557
Well, come in here,
and I'll show you some fucking pain!

968
01:20:51,322 --> 01:20:53,907
I say we go for the coach.

969
01:20:54,032 --> 01:20:56,242
He turned Stan.
He's the one.

970
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,330
Would you rather wait
for them to come to us?

971
01:21:00,496 --> 01:21:03,293
Either way,
we're completely unarmed.

972
01:21:03,418 --> 01:21:05,670
Maybe not. I might
have some more scat.

973
01:21:05,837 --> 01:21:07,037
Where?

974
01:21:07,506 --> 01:21:10,842
- In my trunk.
- In your trunk.

975
01:21:11,009 --> 01:21:15,846
In your car, amongst the aliens.
That's convenient.

976
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:19,016
You got a better idea?

977
01:21:21,144 --> 01:21:22,144
Stan?

978
01:21:24,688 --> 01:21:27,149
You out there, buddy?

979
01:21:58,419 --> 01:22:00,138
Does it really take two of us
to get to your car?

980
01:22:01,389 --> 01:22:05,020
Nope. One of us
is a decoy.

981
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:09,330
Get him!

982
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:16,322
Where did he go?

983
01:22:16,447 --> 01:22:19,617
- Check over there.
- Come on! Find him!

984
01:22:24,747 --> 01:22:26,590
Hello, Casey.

985
01:22:27,874 --> 01:22:29,751
Where are you gonna go?

986
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:33,087
Class wuss.
Eternal little loser...

987
01:22:33,254 --> 01:22:37,590
who comes to school every day
knowing that this is it.

988
01:22:37,758 --> 01:22:39,676
You've been
labelled pathetic...

989
01:22:39,843 --> 01:22:43,179
since first grade, and you're afraid it's
gonna bleed over for the rest of your life.

990
01:22:43,346 --> 01:22:45,181
But we can stop it, Casey.

991
01:22:45,348 --> 01:22:47,599
We can help you belong.
Isn't that what you really want?

992
01:22:47,724 --> 01:22:49,351
Please don't do this,
Delilah.

993
01:22:49,519 --> 01:22:52,647
I haven't been this happy
since probably...

994
01:22:52,814 --> 01:22:54,941
since before my dad died.

995
01:22:56,692 --> 01:22:58,360
You know you want me, Casey.

996
01:22:58,527 --> 01:23:01,571
Come on.
Let's do it together.

997
01:23:31,519 --> 01:23:34,397
Hello, Miss Burke.

998
01:23:34,522 --> 01:23:36,398
Hello, sweetie pie.

999
01:23:38,608 --> 01:23:42,236
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing important.

1000
01:23:42,404 --> 01:23:45,740
So, I take it you changed your mind
about the chocolate laxatives?

1001
01:23:45,907 --> 01:23:50,911
Actually, I had my heart set on something
cherry-flavoured. You know what I mean?

1002
01:23:51,077 --> 01:23:53,580
Sorry, I'm all out of those.

1003
01:23:57,418 --> 01:24:00,378
I might have something else
for you though.

1004
01:24:00,545 --> 01:24:02,672
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1005
01:24:02,797 --> 01:24:07,345
- Something tasty?
- Let me hook you up.

1006
01:24:17,604 --> 01:24:19,606
Hello, Zekey boy.

1007
01:24:27,114 --> 01:24:31,368
You're too tense, honey.
Relax.

1008
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:41,603
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.

1009
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:55,074
I always thought the only alien
in this high school was me.

1010
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:00,886
Not the case.

1011
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:09,045
Who do you think it is,
the master alien, the queen bee?

1012
01:26:09,212 --> 01:26:13,012
It could be anyone.

1013
01:26:13,218 --> 01:26:15,095
What happens at the end
of these stories, Stokely?

1014
01:26:15,221 --> 01:26:18,640
How does Invasion of the
Body Snatchers turn out?

1015
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:22,810
They get us.
They win. We lose.

1016
01:26:25,312 --> 01:26:29,775
Do we?
Maybe we really win.

1017
01:26:29,943 --> 01:26:32,028
Stan didn't
look unhappy.

1018
01:26:32,195 --> 01:26:34,655
That's 'cause
it wasn't Stan.

1019
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:36,698
They took away
who he was.

1020
01:26:39,451 --> 01:26:42,704
Maybe they just bettered
who he was,

1021
01:26:42,871 --> 01:26:46,332
cleared away
his confusion.

1022
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:55,589
I know you pride yourself
on being the outsider, Stokely,

1023
01:26:55,757 --> 01:27:00,053
but aren't you tired
of being something you're not?

1024
01:27:04,558 --> 01:27:06,644
I know I am.

1025
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:22,410
No fucking way!

1026
01:27:41,802 --> 01:27:42,802
Shit!

1027
01:27:48,475 --> 01:27:50,875
Run, Stokes!

1028
01:27:55,314 --> 01:27:56,714
Stokes!

1029
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:09,259
Stokely!

1030
01:28:10,538 --> 01:28:13,538
Stokes! Stokes!

1031
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:20,981
Stokely!

1032
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:25,012
No!

1033
01:28:28,098 --> 01:28:29,474
Stokely!

1034
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:40,360
Come on, Stokes.
Run!

1035
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:43,070
Come on!

1036
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:37,498
- Hello?
- Zeke, I'm over here.

1037
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:40,210
Watch out.
It's her.

1038
01:29:40,377 --> 01:29:44,797
- Zeke, don't believe her. It's her.
- She attacked me. Please, Zeke.

1039
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:47,174
- What's going on here, Marybeth?
- Please, it is her.

1040
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:49,175
She's lying.
She's trying to fake you out.

1041
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:54,763
We don't know what she is:
gay, straight, alien.

1042
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,101
Answer me something,
Marybeth:

1043
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:01,478
Why are you naked?

1044
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,276
Does it bother you,
Zeke? My body?

1045
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:11,238
- I'm getting kind of used to it myself.
- But I saw you take the test.

1046
01:30:11,404 --> 01:30:16,200
Zeke, how the hell can you
be sure what you saw?

1047
01:30:17,619 --> 01:30:21,668
It was sweet of you
to bond with me.

1048
01:30:21,834 --> 01:30:23,711
To be nice to me was sweet.

1049
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,090
Will it work again, baby?

1050
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:32,886
Do you like
what you see?

1051
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,140
Zeke.

1052
01:30:57,993 --> 01:31:00,829
- Take this.
- Now, Marybeth.

1053
01:31:00,995 --> 01:31:03,372
- You sniff it.
- You're out of your fucking mind.

1054
01:31:03,539 --> 01:31:06,584
I'm not taking any chances. I leave for
five minutes, and everyone's an alien.

1055
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:09,837
Now if I have to Men In Black your ass,
you're gonna fucking sniff it.

1056
01:31:12,048 --> 01:31:14,048
Happy now?

1057
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:36,782
Jesus. I'm fucking
seeing two of everything.

1058
01:31:39,534 --> 01:31:41,734
Zeke. Zeke!

1059
01:31:50,043 --> 01:31:52,712
Come on, buddy.
Get up.

1060
01:31:58,299 --> 01:31:59,376
He's over here.

1061
01:32:14,232 --> 01:32:18,945
Casey, come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1062
01:32:24,787 --> 01:32:27,456
You know,
in my world, Casey,

1063
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:31,376
there were limitless oceans
as far as the eye could see.

1064
01:32:31,543 --> 01:32:34,295
A beautiful home
until it started to dry up.

1065
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:36,588
So I escaped,

1066
01:32:36,756 --> 01:32:40,093
came here and met you.

1067
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,460
All of you.

1068
01:32:42,845 --> 01:32:45,347
All of you were different
from the others.

1069
01:32:45,514 --> 01:32:47,390
Thanks, pal.

1070
01:32:47,557 --> 01:32:49,976
You were lost and lonely,
just like me.

1071
01:32:50,144 --> 01:32:55,148
And I thought that maybe
I could give you a taste of my world:

1072
01:32:55,314 --> 01:32:59,818
a world without anger,
without fear, without attitude.

1073
01:32:59,985 --> 01:33:03,321
Where the underachiever
goes home at night to parents who care.

1074
01:33:03,489 --> 01:33:06,324
The jock can be smart,
the ugly duckling beautiful,

1075
01:33:06,491 --> 01:33:08,660
and the class wuss doesn't
have to live in terror.

1076
01:33:08,827 --> 01:33:14,248
And the new girl... Well, she can just fit
right in with people who are just like her.

1077
01:33:18,002 --> 01:33:21,838
You see, Casey, even Marybeth's
feelings can be hurt...

1078
01:33:22,005 --> 01:33:24,844
by a bunch of pathetic,
lost, little outcasts...

1079
01:33:25,011 --> 01:33:28,680
who truly believe that their
disaffected lonely life...

1080
01:33:28,848 --> 01:33:31,183
is the only way
they can survive.

1081
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:35,646
I can make you a part of something
so special, Casey, so perfect,

1082
01:33:35,813 --> 01:33:38,023
so fearless.

1083
01:33:41,027 --> 01:33:42,862
Don't you want that, Casey?

1084
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:45,990
I'd rather be afraid.

1085
01:33:46,156 --> 01:33:49,451
Fine. All right.
Have it your way.

1086
01:33:49,617 --> 01:33:52,578
'Cause this is where your land
of fiction gets it right.

1087
01:33:52,745 --> 01:33:56,123
We win.
End of story.

1088
01:35:04,814 --> 01:35:07,566
Guaranteed to jack you up.

1089
01:35:48,692 --> 01:35:51,736
You wouldn't have
liked it here anyway.

1090
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:20,010
Stokes. Stokes.

1091
01:36:23,349 --> 01:36:26,349
Are you... you?

1092
01:36:28,395 --> 01:36:30,595
I think so.

1093
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:33,901
I hope so.

1094
01:36:40,099 --> 01:36:41,099
Fuck!

1095
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:46,999
- Shit!
- Is it over?

1096
01:36:49,709 --> 01:36:50,709
Yeah.

1097
01:37:03,388 --> 01:37:06,724
All right, you little fuck-pukes,
quit screwing around!

1098
01:37:06,891 --> 01:37:10,394
As you can see, life has returned
to normal at Herrington High...

1099
01:37:10,561 --> 01:37:15,481
after the mysterious disappearance of
several faculty members one month ago.

1100
01:37:15,648 --> 01:37:18,860
Both the local authorities and
the F.B.I. have largely discounted...

1101
01:37:19,028 --> 01:37:22,989
several students' claim
that an extraterrestrial was involved.

1102
01:37:23,156 --> 01:37:25,659
A spokesperson for the F.B.I.
has indicated...

1103
01:37:25,826 --> 01:37:28,787
that no substantiating evidence
has been found.

1104
01:37:28,953 --> 01:37:31,122
That goes for you too, Zeke!

1105
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:34,754
Just 'cause you're the new guy doesn't
mean we're gonna cut you any slack!

1106
01:37:34,921 --> 01:37:37,256
Put that butt out
and get in there!

1107
01:37:37,423 --> 01:37:40,258
Now bring that camera over here.

1108
01:37:42,761 --> 01:37:44,721
When do you think they're
gonna find a new story?

1109
01:37:44,888 --> 01:37:47,432
Haven't they milked our little
high school invasion to death?

1110
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:50,268
Although there has been
no evidence of foul play,

1111
01:37:50,435 --> 01:37:52,603
the criminal investigation
is ongoing.

1112
01:37:56,107 --> 01:37:58,307
No regrets?

1113
01:37:58,609 --> 01:38:00,444
None whatsoever.

1114
01:38:24,591 --> 01:38:26,217
So, how does it feel
to be a hero?

1115
01:38:28,010 --> 01:38:30,346
It's all right, I guess.

1116
01:38:32,013 --> 01:38:33,264
I don't know, it's...

1117
01:38:40,774 --> 01:38:43,653
- different.
- That's him over there. Hey, Casey.

1118
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:45,142
Your fan club's here again.

1119
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:46,993
Network or local?

1120
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:48,740
Both.

1121
01:38:49,868 --> 01:38:52,467
You know, you can be
pretty cool sometimes.

1122
01:38:53,562 --> 01:38:55,998
Things sure have changed,
haven't they?
