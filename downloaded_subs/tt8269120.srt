00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:34,547
- That sure was nice.
- It was, yeah.

3
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,319
What am I wearing?

4
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:39,852
Barbecued steak?

5
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:41,754
Dan's steakhouse?

6
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:44,690
- Steakhouse...
- Maisie, the door's open!

7
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,726
- Does she have a friend round?
- No.

8
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:50,162
No?
And then that waiter!

9
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,697
Boring holes into your behind

10
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,798
every time you went
to the restroom.

11
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,734
Who does that?

12
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,669
The Italian way, huh?

13
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,939
Next time we're going
to my restaurant downtown.

14
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:01,607
These Italian waiters,

15
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,709
they like looking at your wife
when you're having a meal.

16
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,612
That is not what happened!

17
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,715
No, the guy was
a dull young punk.

18
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,650
A dull young punk,
I should've rushed him.

19
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,719
And she left
the water running.

20
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,322
We're home, sweetheart.

21
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,393
Maisie?

22
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,598
Maisie?

23
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,569
Honey?

24
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,404
Someone's been in the house.

25
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:33,509
Maisie?

26
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,646
- Maisie?
- Maisie?

27
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,317
Maisie?

28
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,689
Maisie?

29
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,826
Maisie?

30
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,901
Hey. Genghis?
Come on, boy. Genghis!

31
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:12,937
What's that? Hey?
Yeah, what's that? Come! Come!

32
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,774
Come! Yeah!

33
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:19,914
Did you miss me?
Huh? Did you miss me?

34
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,721
Hey.

35
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,891
Come here.

36
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,031
Appreciate it, huh?

37
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,870
Hey. Tough day.

38
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,406
What do you guys want to drink?

39
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,409
- What are we eating?
- Takeout.

40
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,476
Beer's fine, Liv.

41
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,911
- What takeout?
- Pizza.

42
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,714
Who's been sleeping
on the couch?

43
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,849
- I'll have a beer.
- Anything, Liv. A beer's good.

44
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,118
- Yeah, I'll have a beer, too.
- Oh, will you?

45
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,620
Let me help, Olivia.

46
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,488
No, it's fine, Arlene.
Me and Ray have got it.

47
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,889
Mom, can I have a beer,
please?

48
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,493
I'll get you a beer
if you entertain.

49
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,762
- TV's cheating!
- TV's entertainment!

50
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,062
Not if it's that crap you watch.

51
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,365
Anything with prominent sounds
and bright colors

52
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,569
should be enough to engage
your simplistic mind, Billy.

53
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,671
Touché.

54
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:21,740
You and your big mouth.

55
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,543
I was just wondering
why Ray's been couched.

56
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,945
It doesn't necessarily
mean that.

57
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,848
No, Uncle Morgan's right.

58
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,052
You're officially
sitting on Dad's bed.

59
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,990
'Over in Blue Hill County, we
see a lot of electrical storms

00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,594

No TV.

89
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:39,545
Do you remember
when Mom died

90
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,914
and Dad would always be off,

91
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,749
working or whatever,

92
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,954
and I had to look after you?

93
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,593
This is the same.

94
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,032
Just a little bit different.

95
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,005
I'm here for you.

96
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:12,176
Anyway,

97
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,680
it was always me
looking after you, dummy.

98
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,019
No!

99
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,225
Ahem!

100
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,695
You got a drink problem!

101
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,564
I have a drink problem!

102
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,132
Says who?

103
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:37,069
So how long did it take you
to get all this done?

104
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:42,307
How long is it since I had
pizza? I don't eat pizza.

105
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,676
I hardly ate any of that.

106
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,613
So, Billy, I was expecting
to see, uh...

107
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,148
- Jeez, what was her name?
- Jenny.

108
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,352
Jenny. That's it.
Is she, uh...

109
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:56,188
I mean, uh...

110
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,357
What happened to her?
What happened to Jenny?

111
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:02,062
- It wasn't working out.
- Could you pass the ketchup?

112
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,699
- Noah.
- What?

113
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:09,068
- Don't.
- Don't what?

114
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,637
Pass the sauce to your uncle
like a normal human being.

115
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,273
Don't pass the sauce to my uncle
like a normal human being?

116
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,943
Just do it, please.

117
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:21,180
That's a real shame
about Jenny.

118
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,147
She was a great girl.

119
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,682
- Yeah, Jenny's...
- She was a great girl!

120
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,852
Jenny's great. Uhm...

121
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,653
But we had our differences.

122
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,254
- When did it happen?
- Few months back.

123
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,824
I'm sorry to hear that, bud.

124
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,194
It was for the best.

125
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:38,066
Billy was gonna propose to her.

126
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:46,041
But he got scared, and
Billy doesn't face his fears.

127
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,407
He just runs.

128
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,278
Ain't that right, Billy?

129
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,084
Yeah, Ray, that's right.

130
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,219
You're a dick!

131
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,090
Not today!

132
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,059
Please, Noah!

133
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,826
Just sit down
and finish your dinner.

134
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,764
I've already finished.

135
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,075
Well, there it is.

136
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,283
Excuse me.

137
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,825
Martha and I
actually planned on having kids.

138
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,193
I just wanted one or two,

139
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:44,065
but she, like,
wanted twenty or thirty.

140
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,235
You know how she was.

141
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,438
And then, when...

142
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,010
when Martha passed...

143
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,145
I just felt like
my life was over.

144
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,479
I felt crippled,

145
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,248
like life wasn't
worth living anymore.

146
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,389
And then, in time,
I managed to pick myself up.

147
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:14,229
My life was never over...

148
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,298
It was just hard to see.

149
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,368
Grief is blinding.

150
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,105
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- She needs you right now.

151
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,242
I do not want to talk about it,
Morgan.

152
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,312
I think you need some time.

153
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,147
It's been a year.

154
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,783
But only six hours
since you made peace with it.

155
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,017
Made peace?

156
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,220
You know that ain't
what I'm saying, Ray.

157
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:46,458
I ain't never
making peace with it.

158
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,363
You know what I mean, Ray!

159
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,430
Oh...

160
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,831
Oh, come on!

161
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,233
Ray!

162
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,173
You know I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

163
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,879
Goddammit.

164
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,250
I searched for days.

165
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,224
I didn't sleep.

166
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,060
I didn't eat.

167
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,298
I didn't stop.

168
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:26,367
I couldn't...

169
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,002
I know...

170
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,208
I know you know all this,
but...

171
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,843
The truth is...

172
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:41,216
The truth is...
I let you down.

173
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:46,020
You, Ray, Noah...
I let this family down.

174
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,423
And that...

175
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,191
that guilt, that...

176
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,264
well, this feeling
of helplessness...

177
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:01,402
I feel responsibility,
I feel...

178
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,307
I just...
I just wanted you to know...

179
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,441
how sorry I am, Olivia.

180
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,313
This family is everything to me.

181
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:15,416
Everything.

182
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:18,986
Stop apologizing.

183
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,191
I'm gonna check on Noah.

184
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,580
- What's up?
- Oh, hey.

185
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,483
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, just, uh...

186
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,621
Gregory Mathison's boys
are messing around out back,

187
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:04,589
lighting flares.

188
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,528
Just gonna go have
a polite word with them.

189
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:12,229
Ray...
You sure you're all right?

190
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,498
Yeah, I'm fine, Arlene.
Honestly.

191
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,301
I won't be five minutes.

192
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,202
What's the trouble?

193
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,505
Oh, just some kids
messing around out back.

194
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,673
He wants to go have
a polite word with them.

195
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,610
They're playing with those
goddamn flares again.

196
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,580
They'll spook the dog.
It could be dangerous.

197
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:31,182
Well, Reese Jordan's on duty.
I'll give him a call.

198
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,450
- Yeah.
- God!

199
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,419
Maybe it's best.
Just leave it to the Sheriff.

200
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,090
Olivia!

201
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,191
Look...

202
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,526
I'm just gonna drive down
the track, cut them off,

203
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,662
have a civilized conversation
with them.

204
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,132
Failing that, I'll drive
straight to their home

205
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,632
and have a civilized
conversation

206
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,434
with Gregory Mathison instead.

207
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,770
The last time you had a
civilized conversation with him

208
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,606
you ended up spending the night
in a cell, remember?

209
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,075
Gee, thanks for that
convenient reminder, Billy.

210
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,544
Anytime, Ray.

211
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,146
- Well, you're not going alone.
- Oh, God!

212
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,382
- I'm coming, too.
- No, no, you're staying.

213
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,549
- Dad, come on.
- No.

214
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,151
- Take him with you.
- Olivia.

215
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,554
Just take him, Ray.

216
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,590
Oh, Jesus Christ!

217
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,026
Let me guess -
you're coming, too?

218
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:16,594
I'm gonna feel left out
otherwise.

219
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,664
Me too.

220
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,703
A goddamn circus this is.

221
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,352
You should talk to him.

222
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,487
It doesn't matter what's going
on between you and Olivia, Ray.

223
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,592
You need to talk to your son.

224
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,199
Yeah, shit like that, Ray.

225
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:57,602
- He'll end up hating you.
- My God, stop!

226
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,671
Is he your son?

227
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,576
No, he's mine.

228
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,413
Sit back and shut up.

229
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,651
I hate saying, "Told you so."

230
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,668
Take advice from
my younger brother...

231
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,735
All right...

232
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,370
What life experience
do you have?

233
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,306
- Let it go, guys, let it go.
- Huh?

234
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,441
What life experience
do you have?

235
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,210
I know what it's like
to not like your dad.

236
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,746
You know what it's like
to raise a family?

237
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,418
No.

238
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,650
No, I don't.

239
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,456
You couldn't raise
a loaf of bread.

240
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,636
We're getting out? I didn't
bring appropriate footwear.

241
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,639
There's a couple of flashlights
under your seat.

242
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:10,909
I fail to see
how that's gonna help, Ray.

243
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,611
Stay here with Noah.

244
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:13,578
Ray!

245
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,914
No problem, Ray.
I can do that for you, Ray.

246
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,619
Thanks for asking
ever so kindly, Ray.

247
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,591
Ray! Ray!
Will you slow down?

248
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,391
What's with the weapon?

249
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,860
- Ain't gonna use it, Ken.
- Besides the point.

250
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:31,595
Look, if we run into these kids
out here messing around,

251
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,600
you just let me do the talking,
right?

252
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,702
So what do we do if the Mathison
boys run out in front of us?

253
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,639
We chase after them.

254
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:43,607
- What if they don't run?
- Catch 'em.

255
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,911
- And then what?
- We beat 'em up.

256
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,779
Ain't that a little barbaric?

257
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,682
The Mathison Boys once asked me
to go play baseball with them

258
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,553
in the reservoir when it
dried up a couple of years ago.

259
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:57,322
They ended up tying me to a
fence post with a skipping rope

260
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,327
using me for Spud Gun
target practice.

261
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,394
OK.

262
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,533
Well, then beat them up.

263
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:41,501
I think we scared them off.

264
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,505
They're gone.

265
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,443
Look, I'll have a word
with Gregory Mathison myself

266
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,814
in the next couple of days.

267
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,789
Anyhow...

268
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,356
We should head back.

269
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,827
No point going any further, Ray.

270
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,363
You all right?

271
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,765
Yeah.

272
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,801
- You look spooked.
- It's nothing.

273
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,944
What the...

274
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,543
Ah, crap!

275
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,038
Uncle Morgan?

276
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,538
Shit!

277
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,145
- What was that light?
- You OK?

278
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,148
Where's your uncle?

279
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,028
Kenneth, come on.

280
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,865
No! No, no, no...

281
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:45,905
Kenneth! Kenneth, Kenneth!
What's going on?

282
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,941
Morgan!

283
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,611
It's me! It's me!
It's nothing! It's nothing!

284
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,680
- Look at me!
- Billy!

285
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,615
We gotta go! We gotta go!

286
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,617
Come on!

287
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,956
Morgan!

288
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,026
Morgan!

289
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,192
- What's happening?
- Move along.

290
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,898
- what's wrong with him?
- Move!

291
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,100
What's wrong with him?
Billy?

292
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,702
Ray! Come on! Let's go!

293
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,270
Ray!

294
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,907
- You seen Morgan?
- What?

295
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,080
- Morgan, your brother!
- He's not with you?

296
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,228
Dad? What's wrong
with Uncle Kenneth?

297
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,256
What am I doing?

298
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:17,096
- Open the door!
- Oh, my God.

299
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,369
What's wrong?
Oh, my God!

300
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,803
What's happened?

301
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,671
Honey, is he hurt?

302
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,239
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know.

303
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,908
Honey! Billy!

304
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,075
What's wrong with you?

305
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,112
Oh, my God, he looks terrible,
Billy. What's happened?

306
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:36,748
- I don't know.
- Where is Morgan?

307
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,981
Honey, speak to me!

308
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,651
- Is Morgan here?
- Isn't he with you?

309
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:43,187
No, he's, uh...

310
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,757
- Dad!
- Ray!

311
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,857
- Ray!
- Dad!

312
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,826
Ray, what's...
what's going on?

313
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,296
- Ray! Ray! Where is Morgan?
- What's happening?

314
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,133
- I'll go look for him, OK?
- No, we shouldn't go outside.

315
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,702
What are you so afraid of,
Billy?

316
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,205
- Morgan's missing, Ray.
- Missing?

317
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,141
No, no, he's not missing,
he's...

318
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,176
He's probably lost
in the woods somewhere.

319
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,978
- I'm calling the Sheriff.
- He's making his way back now.

320
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,783
- I'm calling the Sheriff.
- Olivia, that's not gonna help!

321
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,451
Olivia, stop!
That's not gonna help!

322
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,187
Can I have the Sheriff, please?

323
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:19,856
Sheriff? The police are sitting
in our front room right now!

324
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,959
They're not exactly much use,
are they?

325
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:25,028
- He needs a doctor, Ray.
- OK, look, let's...

326
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,432
Let's just take a level
perspective and calm down, OK?

327
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,468
Take a step back, OK?

328
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:35,241
That's what too much TV and
not enough fruit does to you.

329
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:39,443
OK, let's...

330
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,880
You know, your imagination
works over sometimes,

331
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:47,184
and you start thinking
about things, and...

332
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,119
Look...

333
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,353
Olivia, I'll find Morgan.

334
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,159
I'll be right back.

335
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,167
Morgan?

336
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:08,142
Morgan!

337
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,316
I don't...

338
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,822
I don't know what I saw.

339
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,125
Morgan?

340
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,996
Goddamn, Morgan.

341
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,234
Come on, buddy.

342
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:40,470
Morgan!

343
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,316
Something's happening...

344
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,269
Something unnatural.

345
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,293
Something evil.

346
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,408
Ugh!

347
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,498
Noah!

348
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:10,327
- Is everyone OK?
- What the hell was that?

349
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,739
Billy.

350
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,180
Hey, boy.

351
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,782
What did you see?

352
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,321
What is it, boy?

353
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,817
Ray! Don't!

354
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,672
Noah!

355
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,509
Stay back, son.

356
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,680
Morgan?

357
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,418
Is that you, buddy?

358
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,758
Is anyone there?

359
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,829
I swear to God...

360
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,863
We're not messing around
in here.

361
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,532
Did you hear that?

362
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,704
We got guns.

363
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:33,932
Shh!

364
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:17,036
They're in the basement.

365
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,096
Ray?

366
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,168
Ray?

367
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,870
Ray!

368
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:58,287
- Kenneth!
- Where's Ray?

369
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,159
The light!

370
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:02,894
- Olivia!
- Ray!

371
00:47:00,452 --> 00:47:02,288
Don't!

372
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,532
What was that?

373
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,336
The attic hatch.

374
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,404
- Keys!
- Ray!

375
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:55,907
Arlene!

376
00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,943
Ray!

377
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:01,978
Come on!

378
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,213
Fuck!

379
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,315
All right, Ray,
where's the ammo?

380
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:08,153
No, no ammo! Go!

381
00:48:40,853 --> 00:48:43,322
Hey! Hey!

382
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:46,555
Yeah.

383
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,960
Help us!

384
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,396
Hey! No, no, no...

385
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,566
Hey! Hey!

386
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:58,001
Hey, help us!

387
00:48:58,003 --> 00:49:00,972
Oh, come on! Come on!

388
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:05,344
Chickenshits!

389
00:49:06,545 --> 00:49:09,014
They took Maisie,
didn't they?

390
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,059
They turned around
and went the other way.

391
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,097
You were running at them
with an axe.

392
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:44,083
Mom...

393
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:47,052
The stars are moving...

394
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,745
Billy, do you want
to put that thing down?

395
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,258
We received a phone call
not an hour ago.

396
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,695
The call came from your place.

397
00:52:45,697 --> 00:52:48,363
Denise said that she believed
the woman she spoke to

398
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,402
was you asking for me.

399
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,570
Then the call got cut off
by the storm.

400
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:56,472
Mind telling me
what that was about?

401
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:58,575
I'm also hoping it'll explain
why the three of you

402
00:52:58,577 --> 00:53:00,642
are out in both the middle
of the night and nowhere

403
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,345
looking like hell...
with an axe.

404
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,249
Some people terrorized us.

405
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:08,217
They invaded our home
and, uh...

406
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:12,655
Ray, his brother Morgan,
my sister Arlene

407
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,593
and Kenneth.

408
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,327
- They're missing.
- Kenneth?

409
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:19,295
As in Deputy Sheriff Burroughs?

410
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:22,164
And our dog.

411
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,733
Missing?

412
00:53:23,735 --> 00:53:26,336
They were taken.

413
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:29,542
How many perps?
What are we dealing with here?

414
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:32,675
We don't know.

415
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,844
- We never saw them.
- A group.

416
00:53:34,846 --> 00:53:37,380
A small group.
Maybe three.

417
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:38,751
Uh, three or four.

418
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:45,557
OK.
Jump in.

419
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,811
OK, folks.
Stay here.

420
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:10,583
We'll go check it out.

421
00:55:29,594 --> 00:55:31,597
Power's still out.

422
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:35,467
Which means they're still here.

423
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:40,966
Well, whoever was here
ain't anymore.

424
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,875
It doesn't look like
they were robbed neither.

425
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:55,912
We should check the fuse box,
get the power back up.

426
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:58,450
The storm, most likely.

427
00:57:03,722 --> 00:57:06,625
Five shots were fired
in the hall.

428
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:43,061
Huh!

429
00:57:44,963 --> 00:57:48,834
It just all seems a little vague
for my liking.

430
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,940
Well, they don't need
the attention.

431
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,679
Specially not today.

432
00:58:06,518 --> 00:58:09,788
Something definitely
happened here tonight.

433
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:14,023
We just need to get
to the bottom of it,

434
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:17,894
but before any of that's
even remotely possible,

435
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:19,998
I need to get me
a damn strong coffee.

436
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,974
It certainly is bizarre.

437
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:35,077
It's incredibly hard to imagine
that four adults...

438
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,079
...and a dog!

439
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:38,981
...four adults and a dog

440
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:41,954
simply vanished
in the course of an hour.

441
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:46,088
Look...

442
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:51,059
The fact is, neither one of you
actually saw the perps.

443
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,961
I'm telling you what happened.

444
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:56,132
And I believe you, Olivia.
I really do. Every word.

445
00:58:56,134 --> 00:58:59,068
But my job is to make sense
of this situation,

446
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:03,108
and this is a hard one to grasp.
Please understand that.

447
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,887
We insist you come back
to the station with us.

448
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,057
You can get some rest there
and some food.

449
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,258
I'm staying.

450
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,164
- Me too.
- We're not going anywhere.

451
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:35,104
OK. Well, uh... We'll be back
in an hour with some officials

452
00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:38,039
who'll be able to actually
do something about this.

453
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,809
In the meantime,

454
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:41,744
I suggest you get some rest.

455
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,079
I'll be parked outside on watch

456
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:45,014
after I take the Sheriff
to the station, OK?

457
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:48,854
If anything happens, anything
at all, you go straight to him.

458
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:58,961
Olivia, I'm concerned.

459
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:02,164
If any of this gets out,
any of it,

460
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:06,068
it may have a hugely negative
effect on Maisie's case.

461
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,006
What case?

462
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:14,010
Look, I don't think this is what
people can know about right now,

463
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:16,979
not for you
or your family's sake.

464
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:19,715
Not the lights in the sky,
the disappearances,

465
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,885
Ray, your sister, nothing.

466
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:24,686
I'm going to keep it quiet,

467
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,958
and I highly recommend
you do the same.

468
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:29,994
Please.

469
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:35,998
We'll figure this out.

470
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,802
OK?

471
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,806
Now get some rest.

472
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:51,139
Now, is it just me
or is it one of those mornings?

473
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,978
I've never had
a morning like this.

474
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:09,057
I don't wanna ask, Doyle.

475
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,827
Power failure, crop vandalism,
lights in the sky,

476
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,329
phone's been ringing
off the hook.

477
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:15,063
Madness of the crowds.

478
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,971
Well, as a matter of fact, I'd
like to make a report myself.

479
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:26,878
Contain everyone.
Get them all inside.

480
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:31,083
What the hell's going on?

481
01:02:32,784 --> 01:02:34,251
Lights.

482
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:37,720
In the sky. Uh...

483
01:02:37,722 --> 01:02:39,688
Fast.

484
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,191
Non-ballistic.

485
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:46,195
And then there was
this uh... other light.

486
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:50,836
It was, uh... It was different.
It was bright.

487
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,304
Within that light, I uh...

488
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,142
I... I saw...

489
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,912
Who?

490
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:04,282
Who did you see?

491
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,889
Maisie Anderson.

492
01:04:51,422 --> 01:04:53,889
Hey, boy.

493
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:56,191
Oh, my God, Genghis! Hey!

494
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:58,130
How have you been?

495
01:05:05,536 --> 01:05:10,039
Good boy! Good boy! Mm!

496
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:13,976
Are the others here, huh?
Did you find the others?

497
01:05:13,978 --> 01:05:16,014
Huh?

498
01:05:31,896 --> 01:05:33,498
They're still here.

499
01:10:01,332 --> 01:10:03,264
'Ray, ready?

500
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:05,235
'Go!'

501
01:10:12,176 --> 01:10:13,541
- 'Hey!'
- 'Hey!'

502
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,544
'What do you have planned
for this evening?'

503
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:16,745
'I don't know.'

504
01:10:16,747 --> 01:10:18,679
'You have
the house to yourself.'

505
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,682
'I might watch TV.'

506
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:23,451
'Let me take a look
at that picture.

507
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,521
'Is that supposed to be me?'

508
01:10:25,523 --> 01:10:27,522
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Oh.

509
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:29,191
'I look kinda ugly.

510
01:10:29,193 --> 01:10:31,660
'Is that how you portray
your old man?

511
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:33,661
'Make me look like a bear?'

512
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:36,568
'We're leaving now, Maisie.
Love you.'

513
01:10:42,206 --> 01:10:44,205
'Are my keys downstairs?'

514
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:47,276
- 'Yep!'
- 'All right.

515
01:10:47,278 --> 01:10:48,744
'Love you, too, sweetheart!

516
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:52,283
'Won't be long,
just a couple of hours!

517
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:56,250
- 'She does not care.'
- 'She's not listening.'

518
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,786
'No. She's like,
"Leave! Get out!"'

519
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:00,488
'Is she writing?'

520
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:03,825
'Yeah. And she's
really involved.'

521
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:06,597
- 'Did you read it?'
- 'No.'

522
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,766
Maisie!

523
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,836
Maisie!

524
01:11:46,737 --> 01:11:48,806
Maisie!

525
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,753
No, Maisie!

526
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:06,821
Maisie! Maisie, stop!

527
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:10,794
Don't answer the door!
Don't answer the door, Maisie!

528
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,889
- 'How are you?'
- 'Good.'

529
01:14:05,943 --> 01:14:08,744
Hey, Genghis,
howya' doing, fella?

530
01:14:08,746 --> 01:14:10,745
- Hey!
- Want a lemonade?

531
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:12,880
Uh, no thanks.
I'm still on duty.

532
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:14,849
Just came by
to see how you all are.

533
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:17,753
Mom and Dad have gone into town.
They'll be a couple of hours.

534
01:14:17,755 --> 01:14:19,388
Oh.
Oh, that's fine.

535
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,022
You can wait here for them
if you like.

536
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,960
They won't be long.

537
01:14:27,765 --> 01:14:29,630
Noah's staying at Parker's!

538
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,566
Is Parker a friend?

539
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,835
Yeah, from school!

540
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:35,073
Right.

541
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:39,174
- How's Aunt Arlene?
- Uh...

542
01:14:39,176 --> 01:14:40,878
She's good.

543
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:43,815
She says hi.

544
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,961
You never said you were here.

545
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:09,967
What are you doing?

546
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:02,025
Mom?

547
01:23:41,984 --> 01:23:44,451
Who are you?

548
01:23:50,961 --> 01:23:54,365
Let go of me!

549
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:24,494
Where is she?

550
01:27:06,823 --> 01:27:08,388
'Kenneth!'

551
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,460
No, no, no, no...

552
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,689
'In my mind...

553
01:29:21,056 --> 01:29:23,924
'they must have known
of her existence

554
01:29:23,926 --> 01:29:26,294
'and visited her.

555
01:29:26,296 --> 01:29:27,794
'Then she disappeared.

556
01:29:27,796 --> 01:29:31,968
'I guess they must have,
uhm... waited.

557
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:38,938
'waited for us to, uh,
figure it out for ourselves

558
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,644
'before they intervened.'

559
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:46,617
'To help us.

560
01:29:51,621 --> 01:29:53,890
'To show us.'

561
01:29:59,095 --> 01:30:01,597
'But honestly, we, uh...

562
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:04,667
'We don't know.

563
01:30:05,868 --> 01:30:08,772
'I'm guessing
we'll never truly know.'

564
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:27,990
'And now
I can put Maisie to rest.

565
01:30:32,127 --> 01:30:36,565
'Thanks to these... visitors.

566
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:41,938
'These angels.'
