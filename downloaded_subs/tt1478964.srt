1
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,765
Hi, Mum.

2
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,810
Sorry, I couldn't call sooner.
Haven't had the chance.

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,925
No, I'm just walking back to the flat
My shift ran over.

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,762
Loads of kids with firework burns.

5
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,323
How's Dad?

6
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,047
What about next weekend?

7
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,401
I could take the train up, stay the night

8
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,326
I'll call you on Sunday.
We'll make a plan.

9
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,883
Gotta go now.

10
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,927
OK. Bye.

11
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,364
Go on, man.

12
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,363
Hey, cut across her.

13
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,251
Oh, fuck.

14
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,961
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

15
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,330
The money, the purse.
Give me the purse, give it to me.

16
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,005
Don't fuck about.

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,963
Hey. Please.

18
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,564
- Give me that ring.
- It's not worth...

19
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,523
Shut up. Wanna get murked, innit?

20
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,764
- Stupid...
- Get off me!

21
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,084
- Oh!
- Oi, what?

22
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,723
- Boy, you're too brave.
- Quick, fam, 'fore the feds come.

23
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,171
Fuck the feds, man.

24
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,286
Take it.

25
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,564
Look, man. Look.

26
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,726
Fuck!

27
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,330
- Oi, she's duckin'.
- Hey, fam, she's ghostin'.

28
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,446
- Allow it.
- Somebody's bombin' us, blood.

29
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,881
- No, man, it's just a firework.
- Some big firework.

30
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,962
Nice whip.
Could be bare valuables in there.

31
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,811
Raargh!

32
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,524
- Shit. There's something...
- Whoa!

33
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,889
What the fuck was that?

34
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,571
Some orang-utan type thing,
I'm not even lying, bruv.

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,444
Hey, it's breezin', man.
It looked like Dobby the house elf.

36
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,881
Moses got shanked by a Dobby.

37
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm chasing that down. I'm killing that.

38
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,481
Watch.

39
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,761
- Payback, fam.
- I'm proper stampin' that.

40
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,644
- It's gone in adventure.
- Round two, bruv. Round two.

41
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,523
Playtime, bruv.

42
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,451
I got my tool.

43
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,131
No man stunting.
I'm gonna fuck this thing up!

44
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,810
Yo, you got beef now, Moses.

45
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,084
- Yo, Pest, got them bangers?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,724
Jam, man.

47
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,371
It's mine.

48
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,091
Hey, back me! Back me!

49
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,529
- Ah, no, man, that is rank.
- Hey, we broke it up.

50
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,643
- What is that, cuz?
- That ain't no is. That's a was.

51
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,126
I told you, some exotic creature,
like a monkey thing.

52
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,209
That fell out of the sky. You trying to
tell me it's raining monkeys?

53
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,208
That ain't no monkey.
Monkeys ain't bald.

54
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,766
No, that's some weird thing.
I don't know what that is.

55
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,087
- I ain't even gonna say.
- You know what that is?

56
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,044
I'll tell you what that is.
That's a alien, bruv. Believe it.

57
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,765
It must have come from outer space,
trying to take over Earth.

58
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,962
But it landed in the wrong place.

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,923
The wrong place!

60
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,770
- Welcome to London, mo fucker.
- Welcome to the ends, brother.

61
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,770
This is the block. And nobody fucks
with the block, do you get me?

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,326
The B-L-O-C-K.

63
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,284
Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap...

64
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,526
- You all right, love?
- Not really.

65
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,565
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

66
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,887
- Come along, I'll take you home.
- Thank you.

67
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,809
Come on.

68
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,929
You poor thing.
Pale as a ghost, you were.

69
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Must have given you such a nasty shock.

70
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,609
- You sure you don't want a cup of tea?
- No, thanks. Water's fine.

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,207
Bloody fireworks.

72
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,531
I think they should ban them.

73
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,769
Could be the third world war out there,
you wouldn't know the difference.

74
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,723
What did the police say?

75
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,364
Said it was one of the busiest nights
of the year. Bet they don't even turn up.

76
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,050
Only it's not like the kids
are scared of 'em no more.

77
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,448
Walking around with knives,
great big dogs, like they own the block.

78
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,326
Excuse my French, but they're
fucking monsters, ain't they?

79
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,647
Yeah. Fucking monsters.

80
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,807
- ..its ribs and that.
- Have you found anything?

81
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,086
I beg you give me two pound
to go to Chicken World, fam.

82
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,571
That's disgusting.

83
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,523
Moses,
where are we gonna take that thing?

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,524
Take it to Ron's. He watches
that National Geographic shit.

85
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,801
All man ever does is blaze,

86
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,127
water them big buds
and watch the nature channel.

87
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,289
He'll identify that thing for real.
Let me bell him up.

88
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,045
It was madness, fam.
The beast of Brixton.

89
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,889
We were crazy kicking that.

90
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,281
No, Mum. Playing football.

91
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,891
Yeah, I had pepperoni pizza.
You gave me the money.

92
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,605
Some kind of
non-found-out-about creature.

93
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,404
Yeah, like Some Gears Of War thing.

94
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,166
Yes, I know. Back by ten.
I swear, Mum, back by ten.

95
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,046
Ah, she's a nurse.
They don't get paid nothing, fam.

96
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,084
Oi, Moses. Why you always picking
the poor people, man?

97
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,723
- Hey, let's walk, bruv.
- Whoo!

98
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,010
Woy.

99
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,651
- Moses, what happened to your face?
- Battled an alien that fell from the sky.

100
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,330
- You're funny.
- Eurgh, what is that?

101
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,964
I'm sorry, I can't even look at that.

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,765
- Halloween was last week.
- That ain't real. That's a creation.

103
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,564
- Touch it.
- Shove that thing in my face

104
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,648
and them fangs are going up in your tits.

105
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,604
- Move it from me. Grow up.
- Could be diseased, you get me?

106
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,570
I don't want no chlamydia.

107
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,841
So you're telling me
that fell out of the sky?

108
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,281
- Yeah.
- And did that to your face?

109
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,447
- Yeah.
- So, you killed lt?

110
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,241
Yeah.

111
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,130
Such a bad breed, Moses.

112
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,763
Fuck! It's alive!

113
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,921
- Tia is moving to you, Moses.
- She's on your balls, cuz.

114
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,361
Hey, that's my cousin
you're chatting about.

115
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,687
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, watch this jump.

116
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,290
Get down, man.

117
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,681
- Trust, I can do it.
- Humpty-Dumpty.

118
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,291
We ain't cleanin' your guts off the floor,
Biggz. Come on.

119
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,648
- Oh, I swear I could do that.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you can, man.

120
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,566
- Oi, Gavin, you pyro.
- My name ain't Gavin.

121
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,404
It's Mayhem and he's Probs.

122
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,125
Probs and Mayhem? Seriously?

123
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
- Urgh, what is that?
- That's none of your business.

124
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,126
That's sick, man.

125
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,969
Where you going?
Let us come with you.

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,765
Yeah, Moses, let us roll with you.
We're bad boys.

127
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,810
Go away. This is big man business.
You're too tiny.

128
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,366
Yeah, get in touch
when you get your first pube.

129
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,640
Go suck your mum.

130
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,808
- Oooh!
- Whoo!

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,560
♪ Whoop whoop,

Yeah, just on my way to the cinema.

139
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,486
Yes, I promise,
it'll be parked outside in the morning.

140
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,443
OK, Dad. Gotta go. Bye-bye.

141
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,330
I pressed it already. Taking 'nough time.

142
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,562
I'll... I'll just... I'll get the next one.

143
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,401
Express elevator
to the penthouse suite.

144
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,087
Do you remember
what they were wearing?

145
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,169
One of them had one of those
woolly hats with those tassels.

146
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,691
<i>The one that pushed me over,</i>
<i>the main one,</i>

147
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,882
<i>had a black baseball cap</i>
<i>with a red brim.</i>

148
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,929
<i>That's all l can remember.</i>

149
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,850
<i>Did you see their faces?</i>
<i>Have you seen them around?</i>

150
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,882
<i>No. They had hoods and scarves.</i>

151
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,649
You want me to call the police?

152
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,331
The best thing is to come with us
for a drive around the block,

153
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,930
see if we can spot them.

154
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,962
Then we can drop you
with a friend afterwards.

155
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,331
No, thanks.

156
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,364
I'm not gonna be scared out my own home
by a bunch of bloody teenagers.

157
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,729
Yo, Ron!

158
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,288
Yo, Ron!

159
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,441
All right?

160
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,763
No idea. Not a bloody clue.

161
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,761
Maybe there was a party at the zoo
and a monkey fucked a fish.

162
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,203
I saw them with it on the way up.

163
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,006
- Thought they'd won it at the funfair.
- Smells real though, don't it?

164
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,963
Smells like a shit did a shit.

165
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,571
- You wanna buy a bit of weed, then?
- Yeah.

166
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,046
Yeah, come on.

167
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,048
Shut up, man.

168
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,366
Well done, lads.

169
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,051
You've discovered a species
hitherto unknown to science,

170
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,369
quite possibly non-terrestrial in origin,
and you kicked its fucking head in.

171
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,047
- Take a seat. I'll be back in a minute.
- Yeah.

172
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,050
We're getting rich off that, you know,
cos we discovered it.

173
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,407
- eBay, fam.
- Alert the media.

You wanna call The Guardian, blood.

178
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,049
- People will believe it in a proper paper.
- No, tabloids pay more money.

179
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,282
You can't call the paper.
FBI will confiscate it.

180
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,403
FBI? This is England, there ain't no FBI.

181
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,363
It's Section Six or something.

182
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,449
- We need an expert to verify that thing.
- Look in the Yellow Pages.

183
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,802
Look for scientist people who know
about all them meteor things.

184
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,161

Actually, I did this zoology module at uni.

That thing in there don't belong
to no taxon I've ever studied.

192
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,091
You met Brewis, then?
Very reliable customer.

- Yo, Ron.
- You want a bourbon?

198
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,047
Let me keep that thing in the weed room.
Could be worth bare money.

199
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,082
That's the safest place in the block.

200
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,160
Look, I'd love to, but it's not my decision.
I only work here.

You know that, don't you?

336
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,770
He's brucking him in the van, bruv.

337
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,885
Behind the cars, check it.

338
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,404
- Hey, where is it?
- The roof, fam, clock that roof.

339
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,841
Control, re Ballard Street.
We got a prisoner coming in. 557, over.

340
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,407
Also, please advise,
er...four other suspects still in the area.

341
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,843
Not so tough now, are we, fella?

342
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,444
Aaargh! Aaargh!

343
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,684
Oh, shit!

344
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,881
- Nah. Feds got savaged.
- Shit, man. We gotta back Moses.

345
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,321
Fuck that, bruv.
I ain't going nowhere near none of that.

346
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,206
- Think. Think what scared the little one.
- Bangers ain't gonna do nothin', fam.

347
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,810
I ain't talking about bangers.

348
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,002
Let me out, man!

349
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,405
Oh!

350
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,921
- Hold it steady.
- I ain't the one with the shakes.

351
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,042
- Hurry up, man.
- Come on, you lot, man.

352
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,407
Open the door! Let me out!

353
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,285
Yo, cover me, fam.

354
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,606
This is for Pogo. Rest in peace, dog.

355
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,084
What?

356
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,611
Took your time, man.

357
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,040
- Dumb feds left the keys!
- Then let's jack it!

358
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,843
Throw it off, man! Throw it off!

359
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,646
Yo, Biggz,
meet us at the underground garages.

360
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,929
Ire Feelings

361
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,566
♪ Skanga, skanga, skanga, skanga...

362
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,885
Fuck.

363
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,125
Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

364
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,408
Ron, it's Brewis.

365
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,525
Mate, someone's like petrol-bombed
my dad's car or... I don't know.

366
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,090
And there's po-po everywhere.

367
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,646
<i>- I need to come back up.</i>
- All right, calm down.

368
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,889
I've got the binoculars out.
Where are ya?

369
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,730
I'm by the road by the park.
Behind a bush.

370
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,649
<i>What can you see?</i>

371
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,288
Couple of fire engines parked up
by the off-licence, and I think...

372
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,846
<i>- Hang on. Fuck me.</i>
- What?

373
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,131
Blockbusters has shut down.

374
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,448
- Right. No police, though?
<i>- No, you're all right.</i>

375
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,966
Come back up. Not a blue light in sight.

376
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,965
Whoa!

377
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,727
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

378
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,888
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

379
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,890
This is a bad dream.
Tell me I'm dreaming.

380
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,730
Let me out! Open the door!

381
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,724
Wait, blood, wait, blood.

382
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,003
That ain't even police at the wheel,
that's youths in there.

383
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,641
- What we gonna do, bruv?
- Give me the strap.

384
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,243
Let me out! Open the door!

385
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,203
Open the door!

386
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,886
Sorry about the driving.
I'll get lessons for Christmas.

387
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,571
- What were those things?
- We're thinking probably aliens.

388
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,444
- You should leave.
- Before the situation gets more nuts.

389
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,246
Go on, then.

390
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,402
Ain't you gonna thank us
for saving your life?

391
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,400
My fucking hero.

392
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,761
- Yo, Hi-Hatz, it was a accident.
- Nah, trust, bruv.

393
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,689
There's bare creatures chasing us.

394
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,166
Big alien-gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.
I swear.

395
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,841
Some creature fell from outer space
and jumped Moses, so he bored it.

396
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,247
And now its brethren
have come down in force, blood.

397
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,886
Moses got shiffed by the feds
and the things attacked the van

398
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
and savaged the bluefoot,
so we jacked the van.

399
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,606
We're running for our lives now, cuz.
Believe!

400
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,044
Jack a bully van, crash it into my whip
and then chat shit about aliens to me?

401
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,761
This is making me nervous, blood.
That boy's still cuffed, you know.

402
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,485
- Police are gonna be all over this.
- You trying to snake me?

403
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,082
What, you wanna bring arms to me now?
You wanna murk me?

404
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,083
- You wanna war with me?
- Listen to me, cuz, I'm not even lying.

405
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,360
If we was making it up,

406
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,971
don't you think we'd make up
something better than aliens?

407
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,684
Say that word one more time.

408
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,365
I told you, bruv.
On the roof, if you don't believe me.

409
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,885
What? What's on the roof?

410
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,331
- One of them...
- Say it!

411
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,364
One of them big
gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.

412
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,847
Yo, Hi-Hatz, there is something there, bruv.

413
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,931
Yo, go see what that is.

414
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,883
- No way, bruv.
- Move!

415
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,404
Shit.

416
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,451
Yo, Hi-Hatz, bruv.

417
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,323
- There's no...
- Oh, shit!

418
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,929
Oh, shit!

419
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,088
- Got the key to your lockup?
- Yeah.

420
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,527
Follow me, follow me!

421
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,808
Moses! Pussyhole!

422
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,922
I'm gonna get you killed, blood! Watch!

423
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,169
I told you, man. Alien invasion.

424
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,521
London-wide. For real.
I knew it from the start.

425
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,011
Them vans got tracker beacons.

426
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,168
- Police will be here any minute.
- We're fucked.

427
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,567
When the feds find the bodies
and the van, we are fucked.

428
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,241
No. If it's happening all over, the police
are gonna be too busy tonight.

429
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,760
National emergency,
army on the streets, helicopters,

430
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,450
all that 28 Days Later shit.

431
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,128
We need to get off the streets.
Back in the block.

432
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,685
Like none of this ever happened.

433
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,449
Yes, boss. Back in the block!

434
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,403
How do we do that
with them things out there?

435
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,044
That's suicide, man.

436
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,009
- You know what?
- What?

437
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,407
I'm shitting myself, innit.
But at the same time...

438
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,126
What?

439
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,764
This is sick.

440
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,164
Fuck!

441
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,762
They're on us!

442
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,485
- Split! Meet at the block!
- Oi, pedal, pedal, pedal!

443
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,726
Jerome, pedal!

444
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,608
Stairs, blood!

445
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,529
Move, move, move, move!

446
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,289
Where's Biggz?
Where's Pest?

447
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,161
Hurry up!

448
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,930
Go on, run!

449
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,530
Close the door, man!

450
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,850
Fuck!

451
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,086
Grab it!

452
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,563
Aarghh!

453
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,211
Hey, snitch!

454
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,970
Move, man! Huh? Move!

455
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,331
Fucking move!

456
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,361
- Hey, come on, blood!
- Get the bag off him!

457
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,410
- Somebody bell Biggz. Where's Biggz?
- I got one text left.

458
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,602
- I got no credit.
- Drop call everybody.

459
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,326
- Pray someone calls back.
- This is too much to explain in one text.

460
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,443
Get out of my fucking flat!

461
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,962
- Shut up, man.
- Pss...

462
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,765
- I said, get out!
- Yo, snitch, calm yourself.

463
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,290
This ain't about you no more.

464
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,767
Come anywhere near me and I swear
I will scream this fucking block down!

465
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,201
There's worse things out there
than us tonight.

466
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,561
Hey, bruv. I saw her ID card thingy.

467
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,444
- She's a nurse, innit.
- Help me, then. I need this leg.

468
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,642
I need it to be able to run away
from them things.

469
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,364
You think I'm gonna help you?

470
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,847
After you attacked me, and robbed me,
and then set those dogs on the police?

471
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,451
- Yes to the first two, no to the last one.
- Dogs?

472
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,006
Dogs with glow-in-the-dark jaws?
Dogs with no eyes?

473
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,486
Dogs the size of gorillas?
D'you think they're dogs?

474
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,763
Go out there and try feedin' 'em
some Pedigree Chum. They're aliens.

475
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,088
Whatever the fuck they are,
they're not fucking aliens.

476
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,329
- You swear too much, man.
- Yeah, you got a potty mouth, man.

477
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,607
Whatever they are,
they're inside the block.

478
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,290
They're after everyone.

479
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,369
Yeah, we're on the same side now.
You get me?

480
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,249
- No feds.
- You'd be better off calling the Ghostbusters.

481
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,329
This is the block. We take care of things
our own way. Get me?

482
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,567
- You're joking?
- Does it look like he's jokin'?

483
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,207
I was gonna call for help.
Your friend needs to go to hospital.

484
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,130
So do you. If those wounds get infected,
they could kill you.

485
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,050
- Nah, he likes his scars, innit.
- Fuck!

486
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,730
He's bleedin' to death! Help him!

487
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,569
We ain't gonna do nothing.

488
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,844
Fix him.

489
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Jesus.

490
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,006
<i>It's one of me most extraodinary</i>
<i>spectacles in nature.</i>

491
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,923
What if those kids were right?

492
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,087
What if they're connected -
that freak show animal

493
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,451
and the hole in my dad's car?

494
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,927
What if there is some kind of invasion
and the police are out there?

495
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,767
I can't get busted again.

496
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,928
- You've been busted?
- Yeah.

497
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,130
Left half an oz in my jeans, put them in
the washing machine by mistake and...

498
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,960
I shit you not, my mum's underwear
came out stinking of skunk.

499
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,449
My dad obviously caught a whiff
and cut off my allowance.

500
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,523
Next time, it'll be my testiklees.

501
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,767
Yeah, it's tough times for you, mate.

502
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,763
The irony is, now I've gotta sell
twice the amount just to pay the rent.

503
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,484
I thought you said you lived at home?

504
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,929
Yeah, well, I mean...
I mean "rent" in the proverbial sense.

505
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,089
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, you know.

506
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,966
A man's gotta put bread on the table -
proverbially speaking, of course.

507
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,525
Fo-shizzle.

508
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,086
Listen, even if it is an alien invasion,

509
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,162
they're four foot high, they're blind

510
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,965
and they got kicked to death
by a group of kids.

511
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,765
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah.

512
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,285
- All right?
- Yeah.

513
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,162
Sorry I messed up your couch.

514
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,406
- Don't worry about it.
- D'you want me to take 'em off?

515
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,611
That won't be necessary.

516
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,722
You sure? I got nice boxers on.

517
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,084
Genuine Calvin Klein. Fresh today.

518
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,161
- Tell me if this hurts.
- Try me.

519
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,121
Ow! Hurts.

520
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,770
- How about this?
- Hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts!

521
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,280
You've torn a few minor arteries.
You might have a fracture.

522
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,607
This needs treating
before you lose too much blood.

523
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,449
- Do it, then.
- I can't do it.

524
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,847
I don't have the equipment or the skill.

525
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,325
I've only just graduated.

526
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,601
And I missed the class
on alien bite wounds.

527
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,085
Stop hyping, man.

528
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,088
Pass me that cushion.

529
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,929
I said, pass me that cushion!

530
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,769
Oh! Don't take it out on me.

531
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,408
I ain't seen you around here before,
you know.

532
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,563
- You lived here long?
- Couple of months.

533
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,682
Hmm. Nice place you got.

534
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,451
Thanks. Thinking of moving.

535
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,448
Shame. Why?

536
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,563
- I don't like the area.
- What do you mean, don't like the area?

537
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,011
What's wrong with the area?

538
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,970
Fam, stay.

539
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,564
Get off me!

540
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,769
- What was that?
- They found us.

541
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,009
How could they find us?
There's, like, 160 doors in this block.

542
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,123
Whatever gang war you're involved in,
leave me out of it, please.

543
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,968
Hey, this ain't got nothin'
to do with gangs.

544
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,163
Or drugs. Or rap music.
Or violence in video games.

545
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,249
- This is the worst night of my life.
- Feeling's mutual.

546
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,966
Moses, don't, man!

547
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,850
Moses.

548
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,405
Ninja!

549
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,090
Tango neutralised.

550
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,488
See? Is that a dog?

551
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,646
- No.
- No, that is not a dog.

552
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,209
That's black.

553
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,685
Too black to see.

554
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,644
That's the blackest black ever, fam.

555
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,730
That's blacker than my cousin Femi.

556
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,962
Oi, where's that woman?

557
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,130
Wherever you're going,
I'm coming with you.

558
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,004
After what you put me through tonight,
it's the least you can do.

559
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,566
No way, man.
She's bare annoyin'.

560
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,331
Make her leave.
Let that snitch get murked.

561
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,408
Dennis, why you acting like such a prick?

562
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,408
I need the nurse.
Do you want me to die?

563
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,284
We can't stand around here arguing.
We need to roll. Now!

564
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,644
- My name's Sam.
- Jerome.

565
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,364
- I'm Pest.
- No, man.

566
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,401
Dennis.

567
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,605
You're Moses, right?

568
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,685
You're gonna need a weapon.

569
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,402
Move along, please. Move along.

570
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,324
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.

571
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,611
Bring it, bring it, bring it.
Yo, bring the thing, blood.

572
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,001
- What's happening, man?
- Something fucked up.

573
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,328
Hi-Hatz, bruv, there's bare feds in the area,
roadblocks and everything.

574
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,522
Maybe we should chill out
till things die down.

575
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,450
- Are you telling me to chill out?
- No. Wait till things cool down.

576
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,847
- You telling me to cool down?
- Ah, forget it, bruv.

577
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,522
Get in the car.

578
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,326
Get in the car now!

579
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,847
They mash up my whip
with a bully van they stole,

580
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,121
start threatening me about aliens
or some shit,

581
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,090
facing me down,
telling me I'm gonna get shifted.

582
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,407
Hey, watch where you're going,
you prick!

583
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,809
Then, some like...some like big dog,
some big gorilla wolf motherfucker,

584
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,129
comes down from the roof, rolls Tonks,
tears his neck all the way out. Believe.

585
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,171
- So was it a dog, then?
- Don't give a fuck what it was.

586
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,089
Shot that ting. Died easy.

587
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,240
And we gotta learn them youngers
tonight, you get me?

588
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,044
That's my block!

589
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,844
♪ Don't give a fuck

590
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,927
♪ Blat, blat, blat

591
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,406
♪ Get that snitch
Get the strap

592
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,761
♪ Don't give a fuck
Blat, blat, blat...

593
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,365
You get four years for carrying
an offensive weapon, you know.

594
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,404
- I think this situation's a bit different.
- Is it?

595
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,649
Walking around,
expecting to get jumped at any moment?

596
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,648
Feels like just another day in the ends to me.

597
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,286
- Where's he taking us?
- Tia's flat.

598
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,927
- How will we be any safer in her place?
- Security gate.

599
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,851
She wouldn't be asking that question
if she'd seen them girls fight.

600
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,570
Ay, it's Biggz. He's alive.

601
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,689
<i>- Yo, Biggz, we thought you was dead.</i>
- I called you 50 times, blood.

602
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,769
What's your phone doing on silent
at a time like this for, fam?

603
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,131
<i>- Where you at?</i>
- In the bin.

604
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,164
Same bin I was at that time
them boys from Aylesbury was after me.

605
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,330
One of them things is trying to headbang
me out. Rescue me, yeah?

606
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,921
Ain't that simple, bruv. Them things
are in the block, busting through doors.

607
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,970
You're the only one with credit.
Call everyone, spread the word.

608
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,525
Tell them to stay inside. Get me?

609
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,602
<i>I'll bell you back when we get to Tia's.</i>

610
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,845
Fuck this, man!

611
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,051
- Yo, Biggz.
<i>- Listen, listen.</i>

612
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,527
<i>I've got one pound credit and bare people</i>
<i>to call. I can only say this once.</i>

613
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,164
<i>We need backup. Alien attack.</i>

614
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,602
Slow down. I don't understand
a word you're saying. Speak slowly.

615
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,768
<i>This ain't no time to be speaking slowly!</i>

616
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,724
<i>Moses and Dennis are heading to Tia's.</i>
<i>Call everyone!</i>

617
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,610
<i>Tell them to come back!</i>
<i>That thing we killed was for real!</i>

618
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,682
<i>Now there's bigger ones battering me...</i>

619
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,371
Phone me later
when you ain't playing Xbox.

620
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,647
Check it. Reginald and Gavin survived.

621
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,968
Don't answer those names no more.
It's Probs and Mayhem.

622
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,650
Fam, we saw the aliens.

623
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,648
They ran past us, straight.

624
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,364
We got tools.

625
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,210
- Let us roll with you, man.
- That's not real, is it?

626
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,011
- Jesus, he looks about six
- I'm nine and a half.

627
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,442
- That ain't a toy, Gavin. Give me that.
- Hey, leave it!

628
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,889
Hey. Hey, let go, fam. Oi, let go.

629
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,241
Yo, Reginald, Gavin!

630
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,050
Go home, lock your door.
Do your homework. Watch Naruto.

631
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,923
Just stay inside tonight, get me?

632
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,363
That's my cousin's!
I gotta give it back!

633
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,687
Stop bitching,
You got a Super Soaker still.

634
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,166
You really think they'll die
if you shoot water at them?

635
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,885
Ain't water in it. Is it?

636
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,486
You ain't bringing all them in here. No.
They're involved in something.

637
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,000
Someone's chasing 'em.
They got weapons.

638
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,804
And, look, that one's bleedin'.

639
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,769
And that woman, I don't even know her.

640
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,043
I'm not getting myself involved in
a situation I don't need to be in.

641
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,529
It's my house, Dimples.

642
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,686
Come.

643
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,042
Get off me, man.

644
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,321
There's only one helicopter out there.
Copper chopper.

645
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,569
Ain't even military.
And it's only around these ends.

646
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,126
This ain't London-wide.
This is localised.

647
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,482
- Yeah, localised in your head.
- Localised in your dreams.

648
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,443
Drapsed by the feds? Yes.

649
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,643
Big gorilla-alien-wolf monsters
killing everyone? Uh-uh.

650
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,842
- Maybe they only fell on these ends.
- Please!

651
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,089
What kind of alien, out of all the places
in the whole wide world,

652
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,771
would invade some shitty council estate
in South London?

653
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,805
- One that's looking for a fight.
- They're coming for us. Ready or not.

654
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,446
♪ Ready or not, here I come

655
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,881
♪ You can't hide
- Excuse me.

656
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,331
♪ They're gonna find you

657
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,124
Listen to me!

658
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,248
There's a dead one
in my living room.

659
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,290
I live on the first floor.
Go and look if you don't believe me.

660
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,164
You can walk right in.
There's no front door any more.

661
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,170
Moses, when did you start going out
with your maths teacher?

662
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,687
- How d'you know that woman?
- We met earlier.

663
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,171
He mugged me.

664
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,204
- Whey! For real?
- That part I believe.

665
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,607
That true? You rob that woman?

666
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,201
Yeah. But afterwards she fixed my leg
and we saved her from the monster.

667
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,288
So...we're mates now and it's all sweet.

668
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,127
- We're heroes, innit?
- Heroes?

669
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,770
Five of you and a knife
against one woman? Fuck off!

670
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,290
Raah. Cold.

671
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,051
Nah, nah, nah, don't build it up, luv.
It weren't all that.

672
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,129
- We never even touched you.
- The blade was to get it over with quick.

673
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,083
- We was as scared as you.
- Blade?

674
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,242
You're such a waste.
Why's it always trouble with you?

675
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,523
Why's it always someone gettin' robbed
or beaten up or gettin' arrested?

676
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,291
We can't deal with this on our own.
We have to call the police.

677
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,964
You can trust me.
I'll tell them what really happened.

678
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,570
Think the police will help them?

679
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,887
They might not arrest you,
but they'll arrest them.

680
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,641
For the murder of two police officers,
vehicle theft, resisting arrest -

681
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,365
everything that happened
everywhere in the ends tonight.

682
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,164
They arrest us for nothing already.

683
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,928
You know what I reckon, yeah?

684
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,281
I reckon the feds sent them, anyway.

685
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,130
Government probably bred
those creatures to kill black boys.

686
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,403
First they sent drugs to the ends,
then they sent guns.

687
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,963
Now they sent monsters to get us.

688
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,923
They don't care, man.

689
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,803
We ain't killin' each other fast enough,

690
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,729
so they decided
to speed up the process.

691
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,042
Believe.

692
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,487
Pest, I told you not to do that!
Do it out the window, yeah?

693
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,249
It's pain relief. Ask the nurse.

694
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,087
Excuse me, but what is that?

695
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,568
Oh, my days!

696
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,122
- You can't take two, fam.
- Watch me.

697
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,281
Shit. It is a toy!

698
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,206
Help! Hey, Moses!

699
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,647
Dennis!

700
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,680
- Moses.
- It's coming for you, Moses!

701
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,450
Oi, you fucker!

702
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,608
Tia, what you doing?

703
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,241
Back!

704
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,765
Bash it! Kill it! Kill it!

705
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,723
- Don't stop!
- Harder! Cut him!

706
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,163
Kill him! Harder!

707
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,924
Oh, shit!

708
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,363
Yo, youngers, wagwan?

709
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,811
- Nothing much.
- All right.

710
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,842
Nice weapons. Who you fightin'?

711
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,928
- Aliens.
- Is it?

712
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,167
- Seen that yout Moses lately?
- Who wants to know?

713
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,761
He called us for backup.
Help him fight the aliens off.

714
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,086
Bang! Bang! Bang!

715
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,724
So, where's he at?

716
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,046
You know that little one
you killed before?

717
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,605
That was a mistake.

718
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,291
They weren't going for us.
They were going for you.

719
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,641
Actions have consequences, you know.

720
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,762
Everywhere you go, bad things happen.

721
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,687
Stay away from us, Moses.

722
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,404
You should leave.
I don't want no one else to die.

723
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,649
- Fuck that, bruv. I got your back.
- I ain't going nowhere.

724
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,082
They took Dennis.
We gotta kill all them things, bruv.

725
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,091
Come on!

726
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,169
Come on!

727
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,164
Easy kill.

728
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,523
Run, man! Come on!

729
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,404
- What are you waiting for?
- Shit!

730
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,124
Open the door! Go!

731
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,644
<i>Wagwan, it's young Den.</i>
<i>If it's girls, leave a message.</i>

732
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,364
<i>Mandem, I'm on the block, innit.</i>

733
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,243
Dennis, fam, I made bare calls.

734
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,250
Everyone's come down to back us,
blood, but no one can get inside.

735
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,362
Feds have the block on lockdown.

736
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,085
<i>You've got one minute remaining.</i>

737
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,329
I ain't got much credit.
And I can't be in this bin much longer.

738
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,850
I need to make a break for it.

739
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,528
I'll see you at the other side, yeah?

740
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,924
Aargh!

741
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,489
Hey, what the fuck, man!

742
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,807
Why won't someone flippin' rescue me?

743
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,691
Better get the next one, blood.

744
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,803
Go, man!

745
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,041
- Who was that?
- That's Hi-Hatz.

746
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,321
- Man's a sausage.
- Why is he shooting at us?

747
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,442
His best friend got ate
and he's a bit vexed.

748
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,209
I know exactly how he feels.

749
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,811
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

750
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,362
What's chasing you? Why is
the other lift full of bits of dead people?

751
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,890
What? We need to go down.

752
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,561
I ain't going down. There's too many
things down there out to get me.

753
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,969
True say. Bare police, crazy gangsters
and fucked-up monsters down there.

754
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,685
OK. Good. Let's not go down.
Where can we go?

755
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,849
- We're going to Ron's weed room.
- What's Ron's weed room?

756
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,611
It's a big room full of weed.
And it's Ron's. It's good.

757
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,927
- It's like Fort fucking Knox up there.
- Plan.

758
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,166
19.

759
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,125
Bravo Team, on me, on me. Hold positions.

760
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,606
This is long, man. They've all gone.

761
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,881
No, they ain't. Check it.

762
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,126
- Down the end.
- Raah.

763
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,808
I am too high for this shit.

764
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,805
Trust.

765
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,731
- I wanna shoot those things, man.
- Same here, bruv.

766
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,570
- Times three.
- Done now.

767
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,890
- Bangers, man, bangers!
- I'm Brewis, by the way.

768
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,729
- Sam.
- Front pocket, man.

769
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,007
I'm meant to be at a party in Fulham.
Now I'm trapped in this bloody block.

770
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,249
Yo, Pest. Get ready with that lighter.
Yeah, pass it, pass it.

771
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,282
- What about you?
- I live here.

772
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,605
Really?

773
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,926
Wicked.

774
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,724
I'm set.

775
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,327
Lights. Stay close.

776
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,327
Go. Go, go.

777
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,569
- Hurry up, man. Keep moving.
- Wait for me.

778
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,643
Fire in the hole.

779
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,128
Get the fuck off me, man.

780
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,967
Jesus. There's one behind us. Run!

781
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,170
Jerome, where are you, man?

782
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,970
Jerome!

783
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,485
Jerome! Where you at?

784
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,124
Jerome!

785
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,804
PEST:Jerome?

786
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,002
I can't see shit, man!
Come on, come on. Come on.

787
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,923
Pest? Moses?

788
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,363
Pest! Moses!

789
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,250
- Aaarghh!
- Jerome, where you at?

790
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,170
- Oi, lights, man, lights!
- Trying to find 'em, man.

791
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,848
I'm going back. Stay by the lights.

792
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,160
Are you there, man?

793
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,843
They're coming up the stairs, quick.

794
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,450
Jerome?

795
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,160
Help! Help!

796
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,168
- Aargh!
- Follow me!

797
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,771
They got Jerome. Moses!

798
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,724
They took him!
They took Jerome!

799
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,208
- Man!
- Oh!

800
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,448
What the fuck was that for?

801
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,162
Moses, blood!
Come on, man, they'll kill you!

802
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,205
Moses!

803
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,523
- Yo, Ron! Ron!
- Ron, man, let us in!

804
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,925
- Ron!
- Open the door, man!

805
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,281
- Hey, let us in, man!
- Hey, open the door!

806
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,607
- All right?
- We need to hide in your weed room.

807
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,842
It's the only safe place left in the block.

808
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,763
I don't know about that.

809
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,608
- Ah, come on! Hurry up!
- All right, all right.

810
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,005
Come on.

811
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,207
Wagwan, Moses?

812
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,080
Sorry.

813
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,810
- You killed that thing.
- Hi-Hatz, bruv...

814
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,287
- You brought it in the ends.
- I don't want no trouble.

815
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,049
You brought fed in the ends.

816
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,128
Listen to me, bruv.

817
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,324
You brought an alien invasion
to the ends.

818
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,361
Shit.

819
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,845
Behind you, bruv.

820
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,723
- Don't chat me.
- I'm not even lyin'..

821
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,444
Shut up!

822
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,084
I was gonna make you.

823
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,691
Now...I'm gonna dead you.

824
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,402
This is my block. Get me?

825
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,651
Not really.

826
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,441
Wish I'd never chased after that thing.

827
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,048
Wish we never murked you.

828
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,280
I wish I never took that white off Hi-Hatz.

829
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,969
Wish I'd just gone home
and played FIFA like Biggz said.

830
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,043
Anyone got skins?

831
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,203
No.

832
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,009
Bare weed and no skins.

833
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,042
This is my worst nightmare.

834
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,008
Listen, yeah.
We never knew you lived in the block.

835
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,811
If... If we knew you,
we wouldn't have stepped you.

836
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,640
It would have been OK to mug me
if I didn't live here? Is that how it works?

837
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,284
Boy, you's tetchy.

838
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,448
He's tryin' to apologise to you, man.

839
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,768
You're quite fit, you know.

840
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,728
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yeah.

841
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,886
Are you sure about him?
Where is he?

842
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,287
Cos he ain't exactly
looking after you tonight.

843
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,125
- He's in Ghana.
- You go out with an African man?

844
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,482
No, he's helping children.
He volunteers for the Red Cross.

845
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,409
Oh, is it?

846
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,441
Why can't he help
the children of Britain?

847
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,403
Not exotic enough, is it?

848
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,363
Don't get no nice suntan.

849
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,128
Raah. Moses, your jacket's gone rave.

850
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,611
It's glowing in the UV light.

851
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,762
Maybe it's some kind of pheromone.

852
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,090
Maybe it's a what now?

853
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,726
Er...it's an eco-hormone
that triggers a social response

854
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,603
in members of the same species.

855
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,329
Maybe that's a female
and the others are male,

856
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,603
and that... that... that stuff
is what's attracting them here.

857
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,529
They're smelling us.

858
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,081
They fell out of the sky, yeah?

859
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:05,331
Well, maybe they like drift through space
on... on solar winds, like spores,

860
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,886
and...whatever planet they land on first,

861
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,685
the female leaves a pheromone trail
for the males to follow it,

862
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,848
find it, breed, et cetera.

863
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,042
Like bees, like beetles, like moths.

864
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,367
Some fucking funny-looking moth.

865
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,407
Yeah.

866
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,761
Well, whatever it is, you're covered in it

867
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,691
and it seems to be piquing the interest
of a rather hostile alien species.

868
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,644
I'm just just saying,
maybe if you took those clothes off,

869
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,409
they wouldn't know we were here.

870
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,125
You fancy him or something?
Are you trying to get him naked?

871
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,401
No, I'm trying to save your life.

872
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,730
And in answer to your question earlier...

873
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,162
Ah, thank fuck.

874
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,881
Bruv, I swear I will never cuss you again.

875
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,681
Yo, Brewis.

876
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,530
Everyone who touched this thing
got murked, you know -

877
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,764
Dennis...

878
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,165
Jerome...

879
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,611
Tonks...

880
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,642
them feds when they tried touch me,

881
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,488
everyone who had that scent on them.

882
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,567
So if they follow the smell on that, then...

883
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,327
..maybe I can lead 'em.

884
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,961
- Lead them where?
- Somewhere I can blow them up.

885
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,168
I killed that thing.
I brought them in the block.

886
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,803
I've gotta finish what I started.

887
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,124
- What if it jumps at us?
- Then throw the banger.

888
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,401
- What if I miss?
- Then we run.

889
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,568
What if it kills us?

890
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:52,090
No one is gonna ever call you Mayhem
if you keep on acting like such a pussy.

891
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,284
I'm tellin' the truth! I know I lied to you before,
but it's for real this time, I swear!

892
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,483
<i>..I'm calling your dad. You hear me?</i>

893
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,045
Throw it, throw it, throw it!

894
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,121
Now, now, do it!

895
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,731
<i>- Are you even listening?</i>
- Mum, I gotta go.

896
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,524
Just do as I say and stay indoors.

897
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,523
I won't ever do anything bad again,
I promise.

898
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,962
- I love you, Mum. I love you.
<i>- Five minutes!</i>

899
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,567
- Any time, blood. Any time.
- We don't give a fuck, man.

900
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,364
Armed police. Stay where you are!

901
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,811
Fuck.

902
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,087
- Wagwan, Biggz.
- What are you doing?

903
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,646
- Armed police, fam.
- Swear down?

904
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,967
Swear down.

905
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,082
You burnt that thing good. Ratings.

906
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,010
- Easy peasy.
- Lemon squeezy.

907
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,570
Probs and Mayhem, right?

908
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,563
Yeah.

909
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,565
You look clean.

910
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,926
You look good.

911
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,202
I'm betting my life we're right about this.

912
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,766
Believe me, I'd go out there myself
if I wasn't so profoundly stoned.

913
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,963
Likewise.

914
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:52,201
- One floor down. 191.
- One floor down. 191.

915
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,368
- You bell me when you get there.
- Yeah.

916
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,521
Yo, Pest, give me that ring.

917
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,251
What ring, man?

918
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,926
Oh, man, that's ours.

919
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,687
- It's worth bare P, man.
- Give it!

920
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,684
Raasclaat, man.

921
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,891
Thanks.

922
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,764
Even if you outrun them,
even if you make it,

923
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,165
how are you gonna get out?

924
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,888
Don't worry about me, man.

925
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,089
You don't have to do this, Moses.

926
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,363
Yeah, I do.

927
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,884
Oi. Hi.

928
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,524
Is it safe?

929
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,810
No. All right. Good luck.

930
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,486
- Are you sure no one's here?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

931
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,931
Who do you live with?

932
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,405
Just my uncle.

933
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,045
Where's he?

934
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,406
Comes and goes.

935
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,204
Goes, mostly.

936
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,605
You got a little brother?

937
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,766
No.

938
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,605
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- 15.

939
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,045
You look older.

940
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,881
Thanks.

941
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,885
Shut the hatch.

942
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,684
<i>Lock the window.</i>

943
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,802
<i>Leave the front door on the latch.</i>

944
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,320
<i>Turn all the gas all the way up.</i>

945
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,450
<i>Get out the block as fast as you can.</i>
<i>You hear me?</i>

946
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,045
Good luck, Moses.

947
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,171
Later.

948
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,202
Moses versus the monsters.

949
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,005
Kill 'em. Kill all them things.

950
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,724
Allow it.

951
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,884
- Is that Moses?
- Moses!

952
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,887
Moses.

953
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,011
- Oh, shit.
- Is that more of the monsters?

954
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,280
Sort of.

955
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,002
Armed police! Put your weapons down!

956
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,849
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

957
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,603
Armed police! Drop your weapon!
Hands on head!

958
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,083
Drop your weapon now!

959
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,329
- Get off me!
- This one?

960
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,124
Aaargh, get off.

961
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,128
Get off me. Aaargh.

962
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,844
Stop resisting. Stop resisting.

963
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,930
- I ain't resisting. You're pushin' me over.
- I don't even live here.

964
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,645
I am registered disabled.
You're hurting me.

965
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,887
What's your number?
What's your number, huh?

966
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,163
I know my civil liberties.
I'm a member of fucking Amnesty.

967
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,361
Get off me!

968
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:30,730
Our Moses saved the planet!
He saved the planet from alien invasion.

969
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,762
He's a hero. He's a legend.

970
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,724
Moses. Call me, yeah?
We'll get you help.

971
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,808
- Call me.
- Yo, Moses.

972
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,763
Hey, Moses. Moses.

973
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,243
Why do you always arrest the wrong people?

974
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,443
Moses is a hero, don't you get it?
He saved the block.

975
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,084
Excuse me, sir.

976
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,845
This is Samantha Adams,
the woman that called in the mugging.

977
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,601
Miss Adams, I believe you were out
with two of my officers earlier tonight?

978
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,004
- You know they lost their lives?
- Yeah. I was there.

979
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,690
We were attacked.

980
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,802
Those boys there,
the ones you're arresting...

981
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,729
Can you confirm it was them?

982
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,444
Don't let them intimidate you, miss.

983
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,766
No. I know them. They're my neighbours.

984
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,044
They protected me.

985
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,441
Yo, Moses. Hey, Moses.

986
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,802
Moses! Moses! Moses!

987
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,565
Moses! Moses! Moses!

988
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,924
Get off!

989
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,169
Moses! Moses! Moses!

990
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,246
Brap! Brap!

991
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,601
Brap! Brap! Brap!

992
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,802
Brap! Brap! Brap!

993
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,763
Moses, bruv.

994
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,603
Can you hear that?

995
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,850
Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses!

996
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,130
That's for you, man.

997
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,651
