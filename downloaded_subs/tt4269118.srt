1
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,366
Okay, what's the blue light?

2
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,367
Green.

3
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,660
Jesus, green then.

4
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,286
It's just the light
at the end of his dock.

5
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,996
- That's it?
- No.

6
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,124
Please, no. I'm begging you.

7
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,209
I have 55 minutes.

8
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,211
There's been like, ten movies made of it.

9
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,546
Nell.

10
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,799
It's everything, I guess.

11
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,050
It's hope.

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,845
It's something you want
but know that you'll never get

13
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,680
because it doesn't exist.

14
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,474
Or maybe missing everything you've lost.

15
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,476
Please, Nell.

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,061
It's right.

17
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,275
Okay, what about this...
"orgiastic future"?

18
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,737
Yeah, well, that's not happening.

19
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,156
Yeah, but it's in the book.

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,407
Stop it, Jude.

21
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,492
Finish the essay.

22
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,745
Okay, this hope not existing,
that's what Tom is feeling?

23
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,247
- Nick.
- Nick.

24
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,874
Shit! Okay.

25
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,501
Just make it sound original.

26
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,004
You'll be fine. It's really open-ended.

27
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,090
I gotta go. Good luck.

28
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,884
Wait. You going tonight?

29
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,428
Uh, if my dad gets back in time,
I'll meet you there.

30
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,600
- Which egg?
- East.

31
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,351
East.

32
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,818
- Jude.
- Hey, Mr. Wallace.

33
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,528
Don't you have statistics now?

34
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,656
I do. Yeah, but I heard
Mr. Reeves is out sick.

35
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,909
There's a sub.

36
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,247
The thing is, Mr. Wallace, um, I have to
finish this for Mr. Foster's class.

37
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,082
- Uh-huh.
- It's a third of our grade.

38
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,252
You understand that
we're having this conversation right now?

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,713
- Sir?
- It's one thing to skip a class,

40
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,590
but now I've told you to go to that class,

41
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,383
so now it's, sort of, becoming another thing.

42
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,678
Right. Yeah.

43
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,017
The thing is, Mr. Wallace,

44
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,937
I think it might be better for me to
get in trouble for skipping class,

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,022
but be able to finish the essay?

46
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,319
Jude, you're a weird kid.

47
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,113
But we've both got a job to do, Jude.

48
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,782
Your job is to go to class.

49
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,743
My job is to be a guidance counselor
and tell you to go to class,

50
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,746
and also to help you get out
into the real world in one piece.

51
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,373
- Got it?
- Yeah.

52
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,749
Okay.

53
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,004
You had a terrible summer, Jude. I know.

54
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,340
I'm sorry I didn't get
to your father's funeral,

55
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,800
the school wanted somebody to be there.

56
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,011
But you... you still got to follow
the rules like everybody else. Okay?

57
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,598
And trust me, there are
much larger hurdles out there

58
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,642
than a paper for Mr. Foster.

59
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,697
Okay.

60
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,493
Now, we know that there
are marbles in the jar,

61
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,122
but if we make the jar opaque,

62
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,793
is it still possible to say
that there's a one in nine chance that...

63
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,839
Excuse me? Mr... What's his name?

64
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,633
Jude.

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,303
Hey, Jude.

66
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,810
- Am I disturbing you?
- No.

67
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,563
Good. Then maybe you
can answer the question.

68
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,481
- I was listening, sir.
- Terrific.

69
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,191
What did I say?

70
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,739
You have a jar of marbles,
we can't see through.

71
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,824
And you want to know
if there's a one in nine chance

72
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,201
that the number of marbles
starts with a one through nine.

73
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,786
But that's wrong.

74
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,121
I'm sorry?

75
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,665
It's wrong. There's actually a 30% chance

76
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,834
that the number of marbles starts with a one,

77
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,046
and about a 20% chance
that it starts with a two and so on.

78
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,797
It's called Benford's Law.

79
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,925
Mr. Reeves hasn't gotten
to it yet, but he will.

80
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,385
So, it's not your fault,

81
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,096
'cause it's probably
not in his class book yet.

82
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,650
So, if we turn the jar... opaque,

83
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,695
now we can't see the marbles.

84
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,781
That was awesome. Are you kidding me?

85
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,949
I like how he went back to the marbles.

86
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,493
Oh, it was fantastic.

87
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,161
- How'd you know what it was?
- I didn't really.

88
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,371
I think I heard it
on a radio show or something.

89
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,707
- I... I don't know. It just came out.
- You serious?

90
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,168
- You don't even know if it's real?
- I think it is, but no.

91
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,544
Not really.

92
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,338
- Did you finish?
- Barely.

93
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,465
Hey, Judie.

94
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,345
That was great.

95
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,680
You finally found someone
that you could out-geek.

96
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,435
- Shut up, Derek.
- He made it up.

97
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,062
Seriously, Judie?

98
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,898
No, it's real, I think.

99
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,650
I thought it was cool.

100
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,869
- 
- Nice.

101
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,720
No! No, no, no.

102
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,888
You go away.

103
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,182
Mmm.

104
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,684
Wait, what? What is that?

105
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,852
Just a hunch.

106
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,648
I'd tuck that rook back inside if I were you.

107
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,108
Never.

108
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,988
Wait, what?

109
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,240
It was the rook, I think.

110
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,117
Yep.

111
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,828
Let's play again. Reset the clocks.

112
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,504
We picking Nell up tonight?

113
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,506
- She can't come.
- Why not?

114
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,342
Uh, she's babysitting her sister.

115
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,346
She said that if her dad
gets back in time, she'd try.

116
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,641
So what kind of party is this tonight?

117
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,477
What do you mean?

118
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,521
I mean, what kind of party is it?

119
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,483
Just a big party. I don't...

120
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,986
The Muftics are moving,
and David thought it'd be cool

121
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,113
to have a big party in their empty house.

122
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,032
Wow. They just rebuilt that house.

123
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,493
Yeah, but David's dad got a job in Atlanta.

124
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,370
Well, I hope they don't burn
down the kitchen in Atlanta too.

125
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,126
So the parents will be home then, right?

126
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,711
Probably. I don't know.

127
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,713
- Beer?
- No.

128
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,507
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,929
Jude.

130
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,680
- Yeah?
- Um...

131
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,311
This isn't one of those
rainbow parties, is it?

132
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,979
What?

133
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,399
You know, where the girls put
different color lipsticks on,

134
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,320
- and the boys try to sleep...
- Oh, my God, Mom. No!

135
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,031
- Jude?
- Mom, that doesn't even exist.

136
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,824
Well, they do.
I read about it in the paper.

137
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,869
- No, Mom. It's just a myth.
- It was on a parent's blog as well.

138
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,498
Mom, I'm begging you, please.
Don't talk about it. Please, it's made up!

139
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,792
Okay. I'm just trying to be
a well-informed mother.

140
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,127
That's fake, I promise.

141
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,429
Whose house is this?

142
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,766
Is the whole school
coming to this party?

143
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,395
Yeah. They have a rule: if you invite
any kids, you have to invite all of them.

144
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,938
Really?

145
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,982
Mom, no. That ended in fourth grade.

146
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,277
Maybe I should just say hi to the Muftics.

147
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,486
Mom, please.

148
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,738
Just to wish them well, to see them off.

149
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,407
Mom, I got to go.

150
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,450
Okay, call me when you need a lift.

151
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,077
Hey, Judie!

152
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,749
Hey.

153
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,044
The world can be full of pricks.

154
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,588
Try to avoid them.

155
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,172
Okay, Mom. I'll call you later.

156
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,764
Speakers! Speakers!

157
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,529
Okay.

158
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,742
Hey, kids. Don't just hide in here.

159
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,751
Jesus!

160
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,502
I know. There are kids
here from everywhere.

161
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,754
Who brought them?

162
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,422
Nobody knows. They all just showed up.

163
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,424
Derek and June and that group are headed in.

164
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,342
Shit.

165
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,844
- Where are your parents?
- They're already in Atlanta.

166
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,721
I'm staying with my grandmother
for the next week.

167
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,473
- Hey.
- Hey.

168
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,141
Looks like your party got hijacked.

169
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,226
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

170
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,603
There's nothing to do but ride it out.

171
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,688
Will you guys hang out
and help me clean up after?

172
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,231
Mom wants me home by 11:00.

173
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,192
Hopefully they'll be gone by then.

174
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,737
Who brought the keg?

175
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,073
I don't know. Some kid just
dragged it into the bathroom.

176
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,532
Okay, well, you know what?

177
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,910
I need to go to the bathroom.

178
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,913
Jesus.

179
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,934
I don't even remember. Was this David's?

180
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,188
No. Sister.

181
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,030
Parents', I guess.

182
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,074
I think I'm going to go.

183
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,951
- Why?
- 'Cause this blows,

184
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,369
and maybe Nell won't even show up.

185
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,789
- Why not?
- She has to stay with her little sister.

186
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,001
Why did you laugh at school today
when Derek called me a geek?

187
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,005
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

188
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,342
Jesus.

189
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,593
What? It's huge.

190
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,932
Who could have this many clothes?

191
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,018
David's mom, I guess.

192
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,151
They have a closet inside of a closet.

193
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,279
Look, David's rich, I think.

194
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,283
Let's get out of here.

195
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,452
- Whoa. Whoa.
- What?

196
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,705
Great. I'm going back down.

197
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,582
No. Come on. Let's look at these.

198
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,840
Nice!

199
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,428
Probably David's dad's,
from before the Internet.

200
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,721
What do you got?

201
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,723
Jesus, Derek.

202
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,891
What is it, Judie?

203
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,560
Give 'em.

204
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,312
David work himself silly to these?

205
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,980
This is his parents' bedroom.

206
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,523
Gross.

207
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,567
Where's your girlfriend, Judie?

208
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,404
She'll be here. Okay.

209
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,584
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

210
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,419
Hey, kids!

211
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,047
Come up here.

212
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,548
Oh, shit.

213
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,635
Derek's just going to torture them.

214
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,762
Maybe better them than us.

215
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,138
Ah, come on.

216
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,857
All right, settle down.
Get into a circle.

217
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,611
We are going to play a game.
There are only two redheads in this deck.

218
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,446
Real redheads, I've checked.

219
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,699
Everybody gets a card,
but the two who get the real redheads

220
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,535
either make out
in front of us for three minutes

221
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,828
or go in the closet for seven minutes.

222
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,750
But what if two guys get the red card?

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,127
Well, a game's a game.
I guess there's no exceptions.

224
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,922
No. No way do I want to
look at naked old people.

225
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,634
You're saying you don't,
which is cool, but you do.

226
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,679
All right. Sit down, kiddos.

227
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,726
Black. Brown. Ah, blonde, nice.

228
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,978
Brown.

229
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,397
Red! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

230
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,733
Oh, no. No, no. Sit right back down.

231
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,152
One gone.

232
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,283
- You taking her place?
- Shut up, Derek.

233
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,535
- I just want to look at something.
- No.

234
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,662
You're either in or you're out.
And now you're in, Judie.

235
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,205
All right, new game.
Give me back the cards.

236
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,126
- Hey. Let me look at those.
- You saw them already.

237
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,420
Hey, brainiac.
You want to see the cards?

238
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,881
Play the game.

239
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,884
Fine.

240
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,311
Brown.

241
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,979
Brown. Blonde.

242
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,023
Black. Blonde.

243
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,774
Brown. Blonde!

244
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,693
- Hey!
- You're either in or you're out.

245
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,779
So, all the way around.
No reds, so we keep on going.

246
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,449
Black. Blonde.

247
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,910
Black. Brown.

248
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,412
Oh! Red!

249
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,914
Red for Judie.

250
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,957
Blonde. Blonde.

251
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,084
Brown. Black. Brown.

252
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,795
Blonde. Black. Brown. Blonde.

253
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,173
Red!

254
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,883
Shit. Wow.

255
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,095
Okay, we're not making out, so...
let's go sit in the closet.

256
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,516
Come on, Judie, into the closet.

257
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,602
Let's go, Judie!

258
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,732
Shit.

259
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,568
Let's go, Judie!

260
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,979
Don't even think about touching me.

261
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,899
I wasn't going to.

262
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,818
- Really?
- No.

263
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,653
I have a girlfriend.

264
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,571
I know. Bell.

265
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,573
- Nell.
- Whatever.

266
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,743
Do you have a watch?

267
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,999
Uh, I have a phone.

268
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,336
This is going to be a long time.

269
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,298
Yeah.

270
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,141
I'll let you touch me, if you want.

271
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,442
No, that's okay. Thanks though.

272
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,327
I'm going to try to get a beer.

273
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,164
Aren't you dating Derek?

274
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,875
Not really.

275
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,835
Oh.

276
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,507
I'm sorry he calls you Judie all the time.

277
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,260
It's okay.
I've been hearing it since, like...

278
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,846
second grade.

279
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,015
And you do it too.

280
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,642
Yeah.

281
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,481
Your folks name you after that song?

282
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,108
No. There's a book.

283
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,526
Called Jude?

284
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,778
Yeah.

285
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,488
I've never read it though.

286
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,785
Is it true that you made up
that thing in class?

287
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,287
Sort of. Yeah.

288
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,582
That was cool.

289
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,633
Is Kent gay?

290
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,176
No. Why?

291
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
'Cause he never dates anybody.

292
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,225
Yeah, but I don't think that makes him gay.

293
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,061
That makes him
a regular high-school junior.

294
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,021
Yeah.

295
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,275
I know he made out with a girl.

296
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,070
A woman, really.

297
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,404
Who?

298
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,158
Someone's mom.

299
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,120
No way! Who?

300
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,374
Kendall's mom.

301
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,001
Jesus!

302
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,213
Oh!

303
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,723
We're done.

304
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,022
Okay.

305
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,404
Hey, assholes! It's time.

306
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,341
Those pricks.

307
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,885
I'm getting a drink.

308
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,146
Watch it!

309
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,823
Get off him!

310
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,261
Hey.

311
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,597
- You know where David is?
- David who?

312
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,806
- Muftic.
- No.

313
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,767
- What about Kent?
- Shut up.

314
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,486
Where are they?

315
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,032
Downstairs?

316
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,659
Um, they didn't come out.

317
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,576
What?

318
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,161
No one came out.

319
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,429
I already did that, Kent.

320
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,031
- What did you do, Derek?
- Hey. I didn't do anything.

321
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,657
They didn't come out.

322
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,413
All right, well, let's find them.

323
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,339
- Mom.
<i>-  Where are you?</i>

324
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,090
I'm coming home.
You don't have to pick me up.

325
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,925
<i>I've been trying to call you, Ju...</i>

326
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,865
What the hell did you do?

327
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,496
You're... Dad. What are you...

328
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,081
What are you doing here? Mom!

329
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,458
Don't worry about your mother.
Worry about me.

330
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,544
Did you do it?

331
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,420
Do what? Dad...

332
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,798
This is not the time for this.
Did you hurt that kid?

333
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,259
What? No. What kid?

334
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,385
Derek Colby.

335
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,387
I... I just saw him at the party.

336
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,514
- What party?
- Then why do the police think you did it?

337
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,683
Why are there people
saying they saw you do it?

338
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,725
Do what?

339
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,060
Stab him.

340
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,520
In the park.

341
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,525
How are you here, Dad?

342
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,486
What do you mean how am I here?

343
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,447
Where the hell am I supposed to be?

344
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,659
Take it easy, Drew. Please.

345
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,211
Our boy killed a kid.

346
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,549
Don't you tell me to take it easy.

347
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,894
I have to go to my room for a second.

348
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,483
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything, Mom. I promise.

349
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,484
Jude! Change your clothes.
A lawyer is coming.

350
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,059
Seriously, if they're off banging
each other, I will kill them both.

351
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,936
- I didn't think you guys were dating.
- We are.

352
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,604
- That's not what I heard.
- Shut up, Kent.

353
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,606
If anything, I want to date her sister.

354
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,649
They sent her away.

355
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,693
- To where?
- Some fancy all-girls school.

356
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,529
- Hey, stop talking! Where are they?
- I don't know.

357
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,780
There's not another way out of that closet?

358
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,823
I don't think so.

359
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,032
What do you mean "I don't think so"?

360
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,034
I mean, I've never been
in there before either.

361
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,620
- What?
- I never knew it was there.

362
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,330
You have a secret closet in your house?

363
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,625
I don't think it was secret.
I just didn't know it was there.

364
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,422
Jude!

365
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,181
Why isn't the music playing?

366
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,435
- You David?
- Yeah.

367
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,978
The cops are here.

368
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,604
- Did you let them in?
- I don't know.

369
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,317
Hey, people. Shut up.
The cops are here.

370
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,159
- Is this your house?
- It is, yeah.

371
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,536
- Are your parents home?
- No, not yet.

372
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,996
They're coming.

373
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,165
We're moving to Atlanta.

374
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,259
- Is there any alcohol in here?
- No.

375
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,395
Okay, listen. Keep it down.

376
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,814
You're getting noise complaints,
and I don't want to come back here.

377
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,732
Got it?

378
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,525
Yeah, I do. Thank you.

379
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:39,991
Shit.

380
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,369
It's Meade here.

381
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,953
There's no sign of drinking or drugs.

382
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,081
And the kids said they'd keep it down.

383
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,335
<i> The number you have</i>
<i>reached is a non-working number.</i>

384
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,920
- Derek.
- Yeah?

385
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,380
- Call June.
- Why?

386
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,507
To see where she is. Jesus.

387
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,134
<i>...is a non-working number.
Please check the number...</i>

388
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,223
<i>The number you have reached
is a non-working number. Please...</i>

389
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,768
It's not working.

390
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,603
That's what I got with Jude's.

391
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,438
What the...

392
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,901
Stop looking at me like it's my fault.

393
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,781
The police were already here.

394
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,825
- They're out looking for him.
- Mom.

395
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,035
No. I think it would be better
if you came here.

396
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,496
Your dad asked you to
change your clothes, Jude.

397
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,998
- I will in a sec. Can I ask you something?
- What?

398
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,334
Is this you?

399
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,547
- Who gave that to you?
- It was in David's house.

400
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,382
- David who?
- David Muftic.

401
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,050
Jesus.

402
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,969
- Is it you?
- Just give it to me. -I can't, Mom.

403
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,765
Give it to me, Jude.

404
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,392
Mom, I think need it.

405
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,061
- For what?
- I don't know.

406
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,896
I'll tell you in a minute.

407
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,986
He's got one of the pictures.

408
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,029
Of what?

409
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,407
The playing cards.

410
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,868
Jude! Jude!

411
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,329
Jude, get down here.

412
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,761
Jesus Christ.

413
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,618
Your dad's not here, Jude.
He's at home. You know that.

414
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,831
Where is this?

415
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,166
- How did you get here?
- I don't know.

416
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,001
We were in a closet.

417
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,838
"We"? Who came with you?

418
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,423
- June.
- June?

419
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,592
- O'Neill?
- Johnson.

420
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,346
Well, you better get the hell back.

421
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,889
How?

422
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,642
- Where is the closet?
- David Muftic's.

423
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,479
Mr. Wallace?

424
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,273
Why did you hit me?

425
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,112
Is it true that Derek's dead?

426
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,614
Yes.

427
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,077
The police said I did it.

428
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,871
Yep.

429
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,291
You're in the wrong place, Jude.

430
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,259
Get out.

431
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,595
What?

432
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,847
Get out. Get out of here.

433
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,390
How?

434
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,101
I don't know. Try the closet.
Just get out.

435
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,737
What?

436
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,032
I have to get home, Mr. Wallace.

437
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,951
You sure do.

438
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,476
Well, they're not home
or they're not here.

439
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,818
Okay, we're going to stay here.
You guys can take off.

440
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,070
Dad's upstairs. Kid's still missing.

441
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,483
Hey, he's across the street!

442
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,571
You guys go up, we'll go down.

443
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,514
Get your ass up here!

444
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,099
I'm coming, Dad.

445
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,309
You brought
the police into our house?

446
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,478
I didn't bring them here.
Some kid got hurt in the park.

447
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,939
Some kid got killed,
and they came from here!

448
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,440
Get out here!

449
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,031
- Who was the kid?
- Which kid?

450
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,534
- Jude.
- Nobody. He's a douchebag.

451
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,035
Then why did you invite him?

452
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,745
I didn't! He just showed up.

453
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,664
Then why
didn't you get him to leave?

454
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,208
I don't know, Dad.
He's just a weird, creepy kid.

455
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,584
Nobody even pays attention to him.

456
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:32,213
Well, the weird, creepy kid
killed Derek after leaving our house.

457
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,924
- It's not my fault, Dad.
- No, it is your fault.

458
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,010
You let kids in here you didn't know,
kids you didn't like.

459
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:42,431
And you let it get out of control.
And that is your fault.

460
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,143
Hey, Kent.

461
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,686
Hey.

462
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,770
Where's, Jude?

463
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,939
Uh, we don't know.

464
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,734
I think he might have, uh, disappeared.

465
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,404
What?

466
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,905
They were playing that game, Seven In Heaven,

467
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,324
where you have to go into
a closet for seven minutes with someone...

468
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,369
- Or they have to make out.
- So Jude had to go in with June.

469
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,746
- June?
- Yeah.

470
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,207
And they didn't really come out.

471
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,084
Why did he go in with her? It's not like that, Nell.

472
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,964
Oh, Derek made them.
They didn't have a choice.

473
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,175
But how did they "not come out"?

474
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,760
We don't know yet.
We'll find them though.

475
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,762
- Are they hiding?
- We don't know.

476
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,057
But are they still here, Kent?

477
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,393
That's what we're trying to figure out.
But we don't know.

478
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,523
Well, you do know there are
a couple of cops outside?

479
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,066
- A couple?
- Oh, God.

480
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,861
Don't open that door.

481
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,071
This is the police.

482
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,615
- Open the door.
- Upstairs!

483
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,491
If they had a warrant,
they would have said so.

484
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,746
Open the door.

485
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,248
That's bad for David.
That's really bad for David's parents.

486
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,628
Hi.

487
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,755
You're not the kid I talked to before.

488
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,131
No. I'm different.

489
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,634
Open the door, son.

490
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,761
Um, everything is fine here, really.

491
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,554
Did the music get turned too loud again?

492
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,264
Open the door.

493
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,516
We told you to keep it down, and you didn't.

494
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,768
Now open the door.

495
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,728
No. No, really. Everything is fine here.

496
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,104
We're great. How are you?

497
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,857
Open the door.

498
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,110
Um, I'm going to have to ask
if you have a warrant right now.

499
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,531
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

500
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,700
Is there any alcohol being served in there?

501
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,035
Not that I've seen. No.

502
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,495
What's your name?

503
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,038
Luke.

504
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,958
Listen, Luke.
You're going to open the door.

505
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,336
We're going to come inside
and make sure everything is okay. Okay?

506
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,047
Otherwise, everything escalates.

507
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,132
Do you understand?

508
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,178
Um, well, we should probably
take a vote or something first.

509
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,096
Just one sec.

510
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,807
Okay, there's two cops outside.

511
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,726
My brother says this happens sometimes.
You just got to wait them out.

512
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,395
Otherwise, everyone's
parents are getting called,

513
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,021
and there could be booze problems for David.

514
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,982
So for now, keep the music off,

515
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,192
everybody start cleaning up,
but nobody leave.

516
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,655
Hey, everybody.

517
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,448
Let's go.
Let's help me clean up my house.

518
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,455
<i>The number you have</i>
<i>reached is a non-working number.</i>

519
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,332
<i>Please check the number and dial again.</i>

520
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,295
This was
supposed to be 15 to 20 kids.

521
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,671
I agreed to buy you a keg.

522
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,549
And now it's... I don't know how many kids
and one of them is dead.

523
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,176
You know how much trouble
I could get in for this?

524
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,928
I'm sorry, Dad.

525
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,971
Holy shit, you little bastard.

526
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,431
Dad, he's here in the stairs.

527
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,433
- What? Where? Which stairs?
- Back!

528
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,928
Are we friends?

529
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,597
No.

530
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,017
- Never?
- Never.

531
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,227
Not even when we were younger?

532
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,271
I didn't even know you
when I was younger, and no.

533
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,273
Derek was my friend.

534
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,484
- Really?
- Yes, really.

535
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,905
I didn't do anything to Derek.

536
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,907
They saw you do it, you asshole!

537
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,950
- Did you?
- No. I wasn't there.

538
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,827
- Where?
- At the park!

539
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,579
It wasn't me. I promise.

540
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,998
You're a twisted kid.

541
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,292
You've always been a little twisted kid.

542
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,294
- Always?
- Yes, always!

543
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,670
Jesus!

544
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,215
- I'm calling the cops.
- Please, don't.

545
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,008
I...

546
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:57,056
I guess we weren't ever friends,
but I can prove you can trust me.

547
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,349
How?

548
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,937
You wet the bed until sixth grade.

549
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,522
Oh, bullshit!

550
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,566
And I never told.

551
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,364
And you made out with Mrs. Brenner.

552
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,912
You know June Johnson?

553
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,249
Yeah.

554
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,793
- You know where she lives?
- Yeah.

555
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,127
Where?

556
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,380
Dudson and Third.

557
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,965
Corner, I think.

558
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,133
I didn't hurt Derek. Swear.

559
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,469
And just so you know...

560
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,098
you were my best friend.

561
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,695
Oh, wow.

562
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,946
So we get a warrant.
They're a bunch of kids.

563
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,948
- Who knows what they're doing in there?
- We can't.

564
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,033
Why?

565
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,368
Because I already called in
that there was no booze.

566
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,203
So we say we saw it now?

567
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,414
How? Through a crack in the open window?

568
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,207
Who cares? We just say.

569
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,002
There are only three judges in this town,

570
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,713
and more than likely
one of their kids is in there.

571
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,006
Look.

572
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,550
Every one of those kid's cameras is on us.

573
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,053
Some judge will sign a warrant,
I'm telling you.

574
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,974
No. No underage drinking,
no 911 calls, just noise complaints.

575
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,559
No warrant.

576
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,354
But we got something better than a warrant.

577
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,773
You recognize that car?

578
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,610
I don't know.

579
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,528
I've put a thousand tickets on that car.

580
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,907
It's Judy Dragle's kid.

581
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,909
- Oh, boy.
- Yep.

582
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,270
What the hell is wrong with you?

583
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,271
June!

584
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,148
You left me there, you piece of shit! Stop! I thought you said
you were getting a drink.

585
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,319
- You left me there!
- I'm sorry! I swear.

586
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,779
I was getting beat up.

587
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:04,993
What happened to you?

588
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,162
- A bunch of guys attacked me.
- Who?

589
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,165
I don't know. They just surrounded me
and started grabbing at me

590
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,542
before I could get away.

591
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,090
- Are you okay?
- No.

592
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,008
Why were you up in the tree?

593
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,510
Because those guys were chasing me.

594
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:25,222
And I lost my keys
and they kept coming back to look for me.

595
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,394
This might not even be your house, you know.

596
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,272
This is my house.

597
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,648
June.

598
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,693
We're not where you think we are.

599
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,571
- What are you talking about?
- We're somewhere else.

600
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,365
Somewhere the same but different.

601
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,784
And I... I don't think
you should go in that house.

602
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,662
Shut up, Judie. And come here
and help me get into my home.

603
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,380
Go!

604
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,901
What the hell are you doing?

605
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,113
Kent?

606
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,574
I think he's in trouble.

607
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,618
What are you talking about? I think something really
messed up has happened.

608
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,663
Look.

609
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,209
That wasn't there before.

610
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,252
- You think Jude wrote that?
- I do.

611
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,879
I saw him.

612
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,716
And I think he's in trouble.

613
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,683
- This isn't my house.
- That's what I was saying.

614
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,318
What the hell?

615
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,323
Is this a joke?

616
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,826
We're somewhere else, June.
The same but different.

617
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,371
That your sister?

618
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,581
Yeah, but I've never seen
this picture before.

619
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,502
Wait a sec.

620
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,181
June.

621
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,825
Go away.

622
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,916
Molly, what are you doing?

623
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,336
You should've let me smother you, June.

624
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,630
It would've been easier.

625
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,174
- Ready?
- Go.

626
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,597
- That was your sister?
- We don't get along.

627
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,765
No shit.

628
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,358
- And here we go.
- Mmm-hmm.

629
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,570
What is going on?

630
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:12,032
- Hello, Mrs. Dragle.
- Just what the hell is going on?

631
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,576
Well, ma'am, your son's probably inside
with a bunch of kids.

632
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,953
It seems the party got a bit out of control.

633
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,706
- So go get them.
- Oh, we can't really.

634
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,336
We don't have a warrant to go in so
we just have to wait till they come out.

635
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,295
What?

636
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,381
Oh, for Christ's sake, why can't you go in?

637
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,008
We don't have any evidence
of drug use or underage drinking

638
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,427
and now it's pretty quiet in there, so...

639
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,514
really, we just have to wait and make sure
nothing gets out of control again.

640
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,474
Jesus.

641
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,691
Eric!

642
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,443
Open this door!

643
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,986
Eric?

644
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,115
Open this door.

645
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,242
Eric?

646
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,703
Eric!

647
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:02,082
- Eric Dragle, open this door!
- Jesus!

648
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,917
Oh, no.

649
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,670
Eric!

650
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,755
Open the door, Eric!

651
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,549
Oh, come on.

652
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,261
- Can't let her in.
- I'm dead. If you open the door, she comes in.

653
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,057
Cop sticks his foot in the door,
then they come in. Things get worse.

654
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,436
- How does this end?
- I think they'll leave.

655
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,149
Eric!

656
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,445
Uh, hi, Mom.

657
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,364
E-Everything's okay.
I'll see you at home.

658
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,241
Fine, Eric. Fine.

659
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,953
But I am now going to call
your father in the city.

660
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,913
Eric!

661
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:58,305
And that is why we can't leave the house.

662
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,852
Come with me.

663
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,567
I went in there and I saw Jude.

664
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,152
- What?
- I know. I know.

665
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,237
It sounds crazy,
but I swear to you I saw him.

666
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,490
What do you mean though?

667
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:19,910
I saw him and he was getting
the shit kicked out of him.

668
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,286
David, come here.

669
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,707
Was that there before?

670
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,710
- I don't know.
- It wasn't.

671
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,753
We all looked and it wasn't.

672
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,505
- What is it?
- It's writing.

673
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,216
- It says, "Get me home."
- He thinks Jude wrote it.

674
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,260
- Oh, my God.
- The closet was hidden, right?

675
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,221
We all know there was never
any writing in there.

676
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,140
And how come both of their cell phones
say that they're out of service?

677
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,058
Kent.

678
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,393
I think they're in trouble
and maybe they need our help.

679
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,103
Look, she's gonna cry now.

680
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,356
Why do you gotta be such
a goddamn asshole every time?

681
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,316
Stop! Stop it!

682
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,111
Jesus, you guys.

683
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,968
Holy crap.

684
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,639
It's like I said, the same but different.

685
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,018
- Jesus.
- And here, Derek is dead.

686
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,437
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

687
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,190
That's what those guys were yelling
when they were chasing me.

688
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,234
But I thought they were
just trying to scare me.

689
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,194
- They're saying I killed him.
- Derek?

690
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,946
In the park, some kids said they saw me.

691
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,239
Did you? June.

692
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,015
My dad's back.

693
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,268
From where?

694
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,937
From being dead.

695
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,526
How did your dad die?

696
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,946
He hit a deer on the parkway.

697
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,284
But wait, he's alive here.

698
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,662
Maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe this place isn't all bad.

699
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:31,833
It's all bad. It's a different my dad
and a different me too, I think.

700
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,710
Wait. You saw another you?

701
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,379
I saw my room and that was scary enough.

702
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,092
It's Mr. Wallace.

703
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,053
- From school?
- Yeah.

704
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,726
He punched me and threw me in his car.

705
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,520
Mr. Wallace punched you?
Our Mr. Wallace?

706
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,522
He's surprisingly strong.

707
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,364
- And he told me to get out of here.
- How?

708
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,449
He said the closet, but I tried.

709
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,326
- Wait. You went back?
- Yeah.

710
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,745
Maybe if both of us...

711
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,707
The place is gonna
be packed with cops.

712
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,060
Stay in there, Jude.

713
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:35,063
What has he told you?
What has he told you?

714
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,982
That we have to get out.

715
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,818
Good. Yes. How?

716
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,613
We have to go back to the closet.

717
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,782
And so, Jude...

718
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,868
Please don't hit me, Mr. Wallace.

719
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,875
- And why the hell are you here?
- I tried.

720
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,461
- You tried what?
- The closet. It didn't work.

721
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,504
Just you?

722
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:01,965
Yeah

723
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:06,052
So, and I know that you are
the little genius in the group,

724
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,055
maybe try both of you.

725
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,766
Mr. Wallace, sir.
Uh, they found me.

726
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,937
So the house is gonna be packed
with cops and more people.

727
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,316
Get in the car.

728
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,487
Get in. Lie down in the back.

729
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,542
Jesus Christ.

730
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,846
I'll let you touch me if you want.

731
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,437
- Garage?
- Empty.

732
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,191
- Basement?
- We searched everywhere, Derek.

733
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,276
How do you know?
You didn't even know that was here.

734
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,277
Shut up.

735
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,209
- It's just a closet, you guys.
- It isn't.

736
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:23,338
That was honestly the most boring
seven minutes of my life, assholes.

737
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,425
I swear to God, I saw him.
I know he's still here.

738
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,136
- Okay, then how do we help him?
- I don't know.

739
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,429
I don't think we should leave.

740
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,598
What if they're, like,
at a movie or something?

741
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,225
They're not at a movie.

742
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:39,646
Kendall! Kendall Brenner!
Come to the window now!

743
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,064
God.

744
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,150
That's Kendall's mom, Kent.

745
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,945
- He told you?
- Oh, yeah.

746
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,413
Where is he taking us?

747
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,874
I... I think to the house.

748
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,795
Mr. Wallace, if we go to the house,
I think I'll be arrested.

749
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,255
Stop talking.

750
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,482
Stay there.

751
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,579
What's he doing?

752
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,414
Maybe he's in charge of this place.

753
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:48,798
Let's go.

754
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,301
Come on.

755
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,532
- Uh...
- Come on.

756
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,963
You have seven minutes.

757
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,549
Hopefully, I'll never see you again,
but if I do...

758
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,261
there's nothing I can do for you.

759
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,809
Come on, Jude.

760
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,531
Kendall, open the door now.

761
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:59,994
All right, fine.

762
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,499
You see these, hmm? You see them?

763
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,334
Take a good look.

764
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,087
'Cause if you don't
get your butt out here right now,

765
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,256
it's gonna be the last time
that you see them.

766
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,925
Maybe until you're married, Kendall!

767
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,885
Her mom seems mean.

768
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,304
Why would you make out with her?

769
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,764
Shut up, Nell.

770
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,564
- Seven minutes.
- Yeah.

771
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,694
Are you okay?

772
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,574
I don't know. Yeah... I guess.

773
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:50,938
Kent.

774
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,316
You better come down here.

775
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,371
Hi, Mrs. Sullivan.

776
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,664
Where's Jude?

777
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,582
I don't know. Is he not at home?

778
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,251
Would I be here if he was?

779
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,712
Try June's house.

780
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,215
Hi, Nell. Who's June?

781
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,634
June Johnson. They left together.

782
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:20,802
To where?

783
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,346
I don't know.

784
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,933
We, uh... we didn't see them leave,
so they might still be here.

785
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,268
Why isn't his phone working?

786
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,398
That's a very good question,
Mrs. Sullivan.

787
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,651
- Kent.
- It's Luke.

788
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,611
- What?
- He's Luke.

789
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,196
He's Kent.

790
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,532
Yeah. No, it's Kent. Yeah, Mrs. Sullivan.

791
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,410
Where the hell am I supposed
to look for my son?

792
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,427
We still have four minutes.

793
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,144
Can I ask you a question?

794
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:14,981
Yes, it was my first time.
Did I not do it right?

795
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,649
You did fine.

796
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,237
Was it your first time?

797
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,198
No.

798
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,248
What happens if we open the door
and we're still here?

799
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:38,588
We quickly forget about how maybe
I didn't do so good, and we run fast.

800
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,548
You did fine.

801
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,510
Jesus, why do you still have that?

802
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,513
It's my mom.

803
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,307
Really?

804
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,602
Wow. Looks like
it was taken forever ago.

805
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,145
Yeah, but it's her.

806
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,189
And I think it's how we got here.

807
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:57,732
How?

808
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:00,777
I don't know. The same but not the same.

809
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,112
But this was where we were.

810
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,656
And I don't have one.

811
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,992
I don't think it's that.

812
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:11,120
Well, something did it.

813
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,456
Yeah.

814
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,459
I don't know.

815
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,814
You ready?

816
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,274
I guess.

817
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,361
Let's get out of here.

818
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,832
Where is everybody?

819
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,293
I don't know.

820
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,426
- Hi, Mom.
<i>-  Are you okay?</i>

821
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,387
- Yeah.
<i>- Are you headed home?</i>

822
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:55,016
<i>I went by to pick you up
and everybody was gone. I got worried.</i>

823
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:59,186
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Sorry, but, Mom, where is everybody?

824
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,646
<i>What do you mean?</i>

825
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,483
I mean it just seems like nobody's around.

826
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,111
<i>It's late, Jude. Just come home.</i>

827
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,279
Okay.

828
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,864
<i>- Jude.</i>
- Yeah?

829
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,657
<i>Come straight home, okay?</i>

830
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,118
Okay.

831
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,329
- What did she say?
- That it's late.

832
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,581
But it was definitely my mom.

833
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,542
- And everything sounded okay.
- Oh, thank God.

834
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,590
- It's Wallace.
- Should we run?

835
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,845
Yes!

836
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,832
If Mr. Wallace is after us,
where are we now?

837
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:02,917
I don't know.

838
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,255
- Oh, Jesus!
- Come on!

839
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,864
He stopped.

840
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,080
What street is this?

841
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,083
I don't know.
We passed Gaylord. I remember that.

842
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,543
This all looks wrong, though.

843
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,629
- Where the hell is Prosserdale?
- I have no idea.

844
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,172
Yeah, well, we're on it.

845
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,721
- Nell?
<i>- Hey, my dad's back. Where are you?</i>

846
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,472
Uh, I'm not sure.

847
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,933
Well, come to Kent's. Everybody's here.

848
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:06,188
- Everybody like who?
<i>- What do you mean? Everybody.</i>

849
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,692
- Is Derek there?
<i>- Yeah, but he's being okay. Just come.</i>

850
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,779
Uh...
I'm not sure where we are now.

851
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,198
Who's we?

852
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,368
Um, I'm with June.

853
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,246
<i>Yeah, that's what everybody said.</i>

854
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,956
We just got lost.

855
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:27,960
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Uh, some street called Prosserdale.

856
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,171
That's right here. That goes to Kent's.

857
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,255
<i>What?</i>

858
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,923
Just stay on that road.

859
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,384
Okay.

860
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:39,638
I guess we're close to Kent's.

861
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,433
- Really?
- She says.

862
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,691
- Careful!
- What?

863
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,276
There's a dog.

864
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,114
There was a dog.

865
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,632
Hello?

866
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,137
Kent?

867
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,481
No.

868
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,441
Yeah, no.

869
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,776
Oh, yes.

870
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,736
Hi, June.

871
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,030
Hi.

872
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,408
So this shithead kills me
and then you start boning him?

873
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,367
Shut up!

874
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,370
And I didn't kill you.
You're standing right here.

875
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,581
- Dude.
- Jesus.

876
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,999
I still have the pencil.

877
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,584
Why did you do this, Jude?

878
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,668
I didn't.

879
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,087
And why would you pick her over me?

880
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,425
He didn't touch me, Bell.

881
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,472
That is a great answer, June. Well done.

882
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,391
We're gonna play another game.

883
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,310
Seven in Heaven was clearly
a blast for you two,

884
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,187
but this one, I think you'll love.

885
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,940
Really. We've been waiting
for this for a long time.

886
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,651
It's like truth or dare, but more fun.

887
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:00,362
Let go.

888
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,283
- I didn't...
- Don't say anything, Jude.

889
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,201
Not yet.

890
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,926
You looking for mommy, Judie?

891
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:26,096
You know, it's not truth or dare, really.
It's more like lie and die.

892
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:29,141
We ask you a question and if you lie, bing!

893
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,228
The magic door opens up and
grabs someone you care about. And then you get
one more chance to tell the truth.

894
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,565
- What?
- What the hell are you talking about, Derek?

895
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,693
You'll see.

896
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,457
What the hell?

897
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,212
So, when you said that little thing about
how Judie didn't touch you,

898
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,505
that was a lie.

899
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,048
And now here's your sister.

900
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,551
So come on down!

901
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,902
Now you get to play one more time.
Are you ready for your question?

902
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,489
- I wasn't playing in the first place.
- Oh, yes, you were!

903
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,952
June, question.

904
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,497
- What?
- It's an easy one. Trust me.

905
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,915
What, Derek?

906
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,625
Your sister's away at school.

907
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:38,961
Do you miss her?

908
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:42,715
Of course.

909
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,875
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah!

910
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,551
Look at me. It's not real!

911
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,303
You lied to us, June.

912
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,305
You lied to me and you lied to them.

913
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,974
If you hadn't, your sister
would still be fast asleep.

914
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,895
And she would've woken up.

915
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:43,776
Now, Judie, it's your turn. And again, I do think this is an easy one.
We want to start off slow.

916
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,531
But we have a special guest for this one.

917
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,707
Hey, Jude.

918
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:06,715
So that marbles thing that you were so
very smart about, what is it called again?

919
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,220
- Benford's Law.
- Yes, that's it.

920
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,222
I'll certainly never forget it.

921
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,766
But that wasn't the question.

922
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,061
Do you love Penelope?

923
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,816
Or Nell, as I guess you call her.

924
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,070
It's okay.

925
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,323
I don't know.

926
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,745
Well, it seems you do know.

927
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:45,170
Hey, Jude. Is your dad alive?

928
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,260
No.

929
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,388
Wait, what? Are you sure?

930
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,683
- I thought maybe you saw him.
- He's dead.

931
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,226
And how did he die?

932
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,896
In a car accident.

933
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,676
Let's see if this thing works backwards.

934
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,680
Judie, that was a tricky one.
You told the truth and he still died.

935
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,348
Kent.

936
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,143
You're a weird-ass kid, Judie.

937
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,854
Did you wet the bed until sixth grade?

938
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,652
No.

939
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,489
No!

940
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,668
This is not how this is played.

941
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,671
A game's a game, Derek.
Ready for your next question, Kent?

942
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,381
- Oh, shit.
- Please.

943
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:17,679
Oh.

944
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,306
Hi, Mrs. Brenner.

945
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,353
Please, don't ask anything.

946
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,231
- You go.
- Derek.

947
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,317
Why did we never have sex?

948
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,194
What?

949
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,447
Why?

950
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:39,618
Because we didn't.

951
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,578
- 
- No.

952
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,583
No, because you finished
as soon as I took your belt off.

953
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,462
Ready for the next one?

954
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:54,341
Derek, don't say another word.

955
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,321
Go, go!

956
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,920
- In here.
- Wait!

957
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,589
Wait, Jude!

958
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,175
Jude.

959
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,720
- Dad.
- You have to get out of here, Jude.

960
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:42,472
- I know, we're trying.
- Not really.

961
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:44,891
- What?
- You're just going around and around.

962
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:46,602
But I don't know how to...

963
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:50,731
Yes, you do.
If you wanted to end it, you'd end it.

964
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,274
Come on, Jude! Let me in!

965
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,237
Jude, come on. Please, please!

966
01:16:58,196 --> 01:16:59,197
I like her, by the way.

967
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,408
Yeah. I do too, but how do I end it?

968
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,035
Just like our chess games.

969
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,705
You have to reset the clocks,
get everything back to zero. End the game.

970
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,543
End the game.

971
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:14,379
If I end it, you won't be here?

972
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,008
Right. And neither will you.

973
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,428
Please, Jude! Jude, please!

974
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,476
Jude!

975
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,853
Let me in! Come on!

976
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:34,274
- You have to hurry.
- Dad, what is this?

977
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,735
Hold onto it till you get home.

978
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,111
Ask your mom.

979
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,991
Bye, Dad.

980
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,786
Run, Jude. Run.

981
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,539
- Jude! What the hell?
- Run!

982
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,306
Shit!

983
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,330
Hey! Judie!

984
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,874
Shit! Quick. Grab the chain.

985
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,377
Shit!

986
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,088
Keep it closed!

987
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:42,676
Judie! Open the door, Judie!

988
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:54,604
I told you, Jude.

989
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:58,984
If you didn't make it out,
there's nothing I could do for you.

990
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:05,365
You also once told me it was your job
to get me out into the real world.

991
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,994
This isn't the real world, Mr. Wallace.

992
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,083
For you it is now.

993
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:18,295
No, it isn't. I can get us out.
Take us back to the house.

994
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,511
Then we'd better run.

995
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,397
Judie!

996
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,390
Cutting through the park.

997
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,767
How do they know where we're going?

998
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,769
They know and they don't
want you to make it.

999
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,104
- Why?
- They want you to stay here.

1000
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,023
They want to hurt you
for as long as they can.

1001
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,859
- Why?
- 'Cause they can. Because you let them.

1002
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:26,655
This is the place where the worst thoughts
take over. Everybody's worst thoughts.

1003
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:28,698
And you sure as hell turned
everything upside down.

1004
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,618
- We need seven minutes.
- I know.

1005
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,870
- Will we have seven minutes?
- Probably not.

1006
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,580
You said you had a plan.

1007
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:37,749
We're gonna die if we stay here.

1008
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,418
But I know how to get us
seven minutes, I think.

1009
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:44,130
- How do we do it?
- The same way we beat their game.

1010
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,259
We have to take it over.
We need to control it and end it.

1011
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:48,426
How?

1012
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,680
We have to destroy the closet.
We need to reset the clocks.

1013
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:54,766
What? I thought you said
it was the card or something.

1014
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:58,937
Maybe the card's important, but my dad
said to hold onto it till we get home.

1015
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,231
Like a... like a passport.

1016
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:02,399
What?

1017
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,484
It's only important when
you're away from home, but...

1018
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,695
But you still need it to get home.

1019
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:09,865
But how are we gonna tear down the closet
and use it at the same time?

1020
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,617
The gas can that you smashed my head on,
does it have gas in it?

1021
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:13,827
Of course.

1022
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:17,038
We tear it down as we go through.

1023
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,249
What if some of the others have gone through?

1024
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,253
I... I'm sure they've tried, but I don't
think the closet would let them.

1025
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,922
- Why not?
- No passport.

1026
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:31,761
Oh, shit!

1027
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:33,972
- Who is that?
- My grandmother.

1028
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:36,600
- So? Okay.
- She has a key.

1029
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,351
Oh, this is bad.

1030
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,038
Have at them.

1031
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:10,842
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

1032
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,262
- June!
- Go, go, go.

1033
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,056
No matter what,
give it the full seven minutes.

1034
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:16,973
June!

1035
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,850
- I don't like this idea.
- It'll work.

1036
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,061
- How do you know?
- I promise it will. Please.

1037
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,898
They're going to kill us. Please, come on!

1038
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,485
Please!

1039
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,697
Come on. I can't do it without you.

1040
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,547
You're kidding me.

1041
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,145
Jesus.

1042
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,524
- It'll work.
- How do you know?

1043
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,737
Wallace said this is the world
where our worst thoughts take over.

1044
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,030
So?

1045
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,408
We never made them answer
the second question.

1046
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,284
What? We could've hurt them.

1047
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:21,037
We could've killed Kent's mom
or Derek's dad and we didn't.

1048
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,873
And like Wallace said,
it turned everything upside down.

1049
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,168
If we won't kill them,
this world can't use us anymore.

1050
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:31,131
- You really believe that?
- I think I do. Yeah.

1051
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:39,556
All right, let's all play
hands on our heads, butts on the floor.

1052
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:41,016
Now!

1053
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:47,522
-Where's Derek?
-I don't know. I thought he was down here. At least I don't have to pretend
to be Derek's girlfriend anymore.

1054
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:54,904
Yeah, but I wasn't pretending with you now.

1055
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,201
- Are we going to jail?
- What's your name?

1056
01:24:00,785 --> 01:24:02,370
Thomas Phares.

1057
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:06,458
Well, we'll just see,
Thomas Phares, won't we?

1058
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,089
- Shit!
- What?

1059
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:14,674
The hinges burned my back.

1060
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,309
Your sister is fine, I promise you.

1061
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,231
Just four more minutes.

1062
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,588
- This isn't gonna work.
- It will.

1063
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,632
We're gonna die in here.

1064
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,227
Remember first grade?
This is gonna be like that.

1065
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,854
We're gonna go outside
and I'm gonna start calling off the names

1066
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,065
of everyone whose parents are outside
waiting for them,

1067
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:13,149
then you will be released.

1068
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,152
For those of you whose parents clearly
don't give a damn about you,

1069
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,154
we will have a van come
and take you to the station.

1070
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,073
They can meet you there, okay?

1071
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:25,286
Okay. Good. Can I get Lisa Burke
and Chuck Mallet, please? On me, let's go.

1072
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:29,457
Then I'm gonna need an Ashley O'Neil,
Megan Collins, Stephanie Kelley,

1073
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,459
Matt Thompson, Scott Worth.

1074
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,546
Excuse me. Is Jude Sullivan in there?

1075
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:36,589
Sullivan?

1076
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:39,634
Uh, no. Haven't got him.

1077
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:41,261
June Johnson?

1078
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:43,179
Johnson.

1079
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:44,681
Nope.

1080
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:46,057
I think our kids are missing.

1081
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:48,810
Their phones don't work.
Someone here said they left.

1082
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:49,894
Disappeared.

1083
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:52,313
Disappeared is, I guess, what they said.

1084
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:13,102
Everybody just stay there for a second, okay?

1085
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:16,189
- Jude.
- Mom, just for a second.

1086
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:28,785
I didn't kill Derek.

1087
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,872
Okay, that's... that's good.

1088
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,461
Jude, nice to see you. You too, June.

1089
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:47,595
Kent, are we friends?

1090
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,515
Of course we're friends, man.

1091
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,020
Where you been?

1092
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,983
I'm not sure, I guess.

1093
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:06,572
Hey.

1094
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,449
Where did you guys go?

1095
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,661
It's really confusing now.

1096
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:14,455
Okay, I'm gonna go back up there
and I'm gonna look for Derek.

1097
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,679
Where the hell were you, huh?

1098
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:31,222
We searched the house, top to bottom.

1099
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:47,530
Did you guys go to a campfire?

1100
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:54,662
Hey, Mom.

1101
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,132
What's this?

1102
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:11,596
A few of us made these years ago.

1103
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:15,016
When we first moved here.
It was sort of a joke gift.

1104
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,895
We made them and we put them in the pack

1105
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,980
and we gave them to the husbands.

1106
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:23,524
What did dad do when he saw it?

1107
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,568
He played along.

1108
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:29,697
I think he liked seeing
some silly different version of me.

1109
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:30,615
Oh.

1110
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:32,784
You okay?

1111
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,411
Yeah.

1112
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:39,916
Wow, that was forever ago.
