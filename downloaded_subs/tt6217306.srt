1
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,042
<i>My dearest father...</i>

2
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,542
<i>I pray that you have not been consumed
with worry</i>

3
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,042
<i>in the time that has passed
since I was taken.</i>

4
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,250
<i>I write to you in the hope that you will
put an end to my suffering</i>

5
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,917
<i>on this wretched island.</i>

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,458
<i>My captors inform me
that if I am to survive,</i>

7
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:30,458
<i>you must travel here alone with the means
to purchase my freedom.</i>

8
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,750
<i>That should a man of law be sent
in your stead, it would seal my fate.</i>

9
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,208
<i>Father, I grow weary.</i>

10
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,917
"I fear our Lord no longer hears
my prayer.

11
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,458
Yet still, I pray for your presence...

12
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,750
for my savior.

13
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,417
Please bring me home.

14
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,792
Your beloved daughter...

15
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,167
Jennifer."

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,750
The world thinks you're dead.

17
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,875
And then, till I found you,
I thought the same.

18
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,708
<i>That ransom letter...</i>

19
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:20,917
it was addressed to him.

20
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,625
Look at him.

21
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,750
He's broken.

22
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,542
He lost.

23
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:46,417
Doesn't even know you're here...
let alone that she's gone.

24
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,917
Whatever ill there is that stands...

25
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,125
stands between you and him,
not your sister.

26
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,417
She needs you, Thomas.

27
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,083
Now more than ever.

28
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,708
And what of the ransom?

29
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,958
<i>They won't be expecting you.</i>

30
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,833
<i>Stay hidden among his flock.</i>

31
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:17,000
<i>But do not pay the ransom they seek...</i>

32
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,000
<i>until you see her.</i>

33
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:20,917
<i>Alive.</i>

34
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,792
<i>These people...</i>

35
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,833
<i>they're blasphemers...</i>

36
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,167
<i>a cult, a disease.</i>

37
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,792
<i>Be careful. Be smart.</i>

38
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,833
<i>Bring her home.</i>

39
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,375
Have your tickets ready, please.

40
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:39,375
All printed materials, corrupting images,
ornaments, decorations from the mainland

41
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,292
are strictly forbidden.

42
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,458
Clothing... and heirlooms only.

43
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,708
Welcome, brother.

44
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,000
Welcome, brother.

45
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,875
Welcome, brother.

46
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,333
Welcome, sister.

47
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,417
Welcome, brother.

48
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,792
Welcome, brother.

49
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,167
Welcome, sister.

50
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,125
- May I help you, brother?
- Much thanks, sir.

51
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,542
Welcome, brother.

52
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,375
Welcome, brother.

53
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,292
Welcome, sister.

54
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,250
Thank you, sir.

55
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,458
Welcome, brother.

56
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:04,917
Welcome, brother.

57
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,333
Welcome, sister.

58
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,125
Welcome, brother.

59
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,708
Full ahead!

60
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,042
- Brother...
- Sister.

61
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,875
Forgive me, it's just...

62
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,625
I don't recall having seen you
at any prayer meetings.

63
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,417
Nor I you.

64
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,000
Some happenstance?

65
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,542
Quite. Only...

66
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,458
Only we meet now.

67
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,750
We do.

68
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,292
It was as intended.

69
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,750
Only She decides whether to give or take.

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,583
We do not intervene.

71
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,833
Amen.

72
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,583
Let me, sir.

73
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,250
Welcome to Erisden, sir.

74
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,917
- Should you need anything...
- I don't need anything, boy.

75
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,250
Ffion.

76
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,375
- Prepare the table.
- Aye, Father.

77
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,625
All new citizens, please line up.

78
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:05,250
Oh, my!

79
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,333
Open your mouth, please.
Put your tongue out.

80
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:27,125
Okay, thank you.

81
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,875
- Name?
- Elaine Williams.

82
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,958
- Age?
- Thirty-eight.

83
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,958
- Hello. Let's look here.
- Skill or trade?

84
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,792
- Seamstress.
- Okay.

85
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,542
- Tell of your donation.
- I offer my undying devotion...

86
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,000
Open your mouth
and put your tongue out, please.

87
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,875
- ...drop of my blood to Our Lady.
- As we should.

88
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,833
Criminal record?

89
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,208
Vagrancy.

90
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,250
Worry not, Elaine.
You'll want for nothing here.

91
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,167
Please take your receptacle.

92
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,750
Welcome to Erisden, Elaine.

93
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,833
That's good.

94
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Name?

95
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,125
Thomas Richardson.

96
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,708
How long ago did he begin?

97
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,875
I have no idea.

98
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,083
At least I'm not the last to arrive.
He hates that.

99
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,292
You've got, uh... something on your...

100
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,333
Don't tell.

101
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,583
Radicalist!

102
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,125
Conspirator.

103
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,667
Traitor!

104
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,667
Enemy of the King.

105
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,917
Those are the words
they attributed to me...

106
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:16,667
as they shackled my hands
and the hands of my brothers...

107
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,625
before they imprisoned us
on the charge of treason.

108
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,375
Sentenced to death.

109
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
But for what?

110
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,875
My only crime was to dare to dream
of a world

111
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:39,125
in which each waking day we rise equal.

112
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,625
Compassion is no crime.

113
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,292
But my fate was not to be found in death,
my friends.

114
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,542
No, no.

115
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,000
Three brothers we became...

116
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,583
bonded by our escape.

117
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:04,208
Stowaways, cast into the rough seas.

118
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,917
Oh, the taste of the ocean beating down
my throat, I shall never forget.

119
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:11,917
<i>But...</i>

120
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,042
nor will I...

121
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,958
the sweet, sweet sound...

122
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,000
<i>of her voice...</i>

123
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:28,833
as she beckoned us out of the storm.

124
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,417
She...

125
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,167
the goddess of this island,

126
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,917
who saved us...

127
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,500
and who chose my...

128
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,250
chose my tongue... through which to speak.

129
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:56,833
A man who once walked godless,

130
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,208
she gifted me her wisdom,

131
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:08,542
entrusted me that I may enrich...
your minds.

132
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:24,167
I ask you all... where is the land
which has no call for wars?

133
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,333
Hmm?

134
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,042
Arms? Money? Nor taxes?

135
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,917
Well, that land is here.

136
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,958
No tax-gatherer's bill shall ever
threaten our church door!

137
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,792
We, I tell thee, we...

138
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,875
we are free men.

139
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,375
Come on! Let's play!

140
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,625
Wait for me!

141
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,417
What's this?

142
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,727
He wouldn't tell us where the money is.

143
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,875
Well, now you've so broken the man,
he can't tell us...

144
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,417
even if he wanted to!

145
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,583
- You've brought the wrong man.
- It's him.

146
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:09,250
Of course it's him.
He's the one that gave me this.

147
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,458
It has the mark.

148
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,875
My brother.

149
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:34,958
I have promised you a life of
riches without the icy sting of suffering,

150
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,042
greed, and injustice.

151
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,958
And yet here you are...

152
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,625
and there you suffer.

153
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,958
Ssh, ssh.

154
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,000
We have an intruder on our land.

155
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,333
He's out there... somewhere.
He knows to remain hidden.

156
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,250
We have to find him.

157
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:46,667
Did you miss me?

158
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:51,000
You were only away for two sunsets.

159
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,417
Aye, and two sunrises.

160
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,708
One day, I promise,
we won't have to hide like this.

161
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,250
We'll have our own house,
with our own name.

162
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,708
We can take this boat and use the wood.

163
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,250
You'll...

164
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:13,583
You're going to build me a house
using this now, are you?

165
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,000
No, you're right.
It's a stupid... stupid idea.

166
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,083
No.

167
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,375
I'm sorry.

168
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,750
It's beautiful.

169
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,250
And look, we have enough to make
a front door,

170
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,125
enough to carve the name
of our home onto it,

171
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,250
and we can hang it up in the rafters.

172
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,958
And everyone who knows us,
they'll see... and they'll know it's ours.

173
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,708
No one will ever stop me
taking care of you.

174
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,083
I love you, Jeremy.

175
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,417
Ffion, we shouldn't.

176
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,583
It's all right.

177
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,083
I'm with you, Jeremy.

178
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,417
Call to quarters!

179
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,625
Back to your dwellings!

180
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,625
The hour of night is here.

181
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,792
Call to quarters!

182
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,958
Ah.

183
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Sorry.

184
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:29,417
Shh.

185
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,333
It's okay.

186
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,167
Who is it?

187
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,208
It's, um... It's me, sir.

188
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:36,708
What is it?

189
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:39,708
Time for work.

190
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:07,417
Five more, and she'll do!

191
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:08,792
Five more!

192
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,417
What is it?

193
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,750
Uh, sir, last night, I'd like to know
why you... What...

194
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,042
Why was I outside?

195
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:22,875
I was having a cigarette.

196
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,958
Why were you?

197
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,417
Such distrust.

198
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,250
And I was of a mind
I could put my faith in you.

199
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,333
Sorry, sir. I beg your forgiveness.

200
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,750
I mean no insult or quarrel, I just...

201
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,292
I have limited thought, and...

202
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,542
Sorry.

203
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,083
No, I apologize, Jeremy.

204
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,083
Forgive my lack of grace.

205
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,125
I will gladly forgive you, sir...

206
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,333
so long as you'll be so good
as to help me?

207
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,208
With what?

208
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:13,917
You dragged this here by yourself?

209
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,333
Not I. A man.

210
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:21,000
Malcolm, he says the man wanted
to bring death here. Says he was a spy.

211
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,292
He tried to leave, but the sea took him.

212
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,125
She protected us.

213
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,667
Did she?

214
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,667
Do many seek to leave the island?

215
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:43,458
Just the blasphemers.

216
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:49,083
Are they granted safe passage?

217
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,667
Why do you ask, sir?
You've been here but a day.

218
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,042
I can trust you, can't I, Jeremy?

219
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Of course, sir. What bothers you?

220
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,792
- Sir, I must go now.
- No, you don't!

221
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,125
You know her. Yes, you do,
I can see that you do.

222
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,417
For Christ's sake, be a man, not a child.

223
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,292
- I don't know of what you speak.
- You're lying!

224
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,958
Please, I should go. I should.

225
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,667
Look her in the eye and lie to me again.
You know her.

226
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,750
Say it.

227
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,083
I knew her.

228
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,917
A month ago, she was on our boat.

229
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,667
<i>Frank said we had no choice.</i>

230
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:41,458
<i>The crops are failing,
the animals have stopped breeding.</i>

231
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,458
<i>We have no means to smuggle food
in from the mainland.</i>

232
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,292
<i>He said her father was rich,</i>

233
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:51,667
<i>but we only wanted his money
so we wouldn't starve.</i>

234
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,083
<i>But it never came.</i>

235
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:25,667
Why didn't you help her?

236
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,417
Look at me, Mr. Richardson.

237
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,726
If they thought I had any part,
if they caught her in my charge...

238
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,917
They? Who's they?

239
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,917
Prophet Malcolm's guards.
Please, sir, I beg of you.

240
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,062
If you are in possession of the ransom
they seek, do not pay it.

241
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,167
You, boy, are in my charge.

242
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:52,226
If you wish to keep your affair
with that girl in the shadows,

243
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,375
you will serve me during my time
on this land,

244
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:57,417
and hold fast the purpose
of my being here. Do you understand?

245
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,458
Good.

246
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:07,098
Hold her down, for fuck's sake!

247
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,208
Jesus, it's turned.

248
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:12,458
Pull.

249
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,667
We cannot go on like this.

250
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,833
She will gift us another pure harvest.

251
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,250
Have faith.

252
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:01,458
All new arrivals,
please make your way to the church!

253
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Ffion?

254
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:24,958
What is it?

255
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:26,875
Tell me.

256
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,750
You're... you're knowledgeable.

257
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,875
You would know if I...

258
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:42,958
if I should be with child.

259
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,417
Well, first, you and Jeremy
would have to...

260
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,125
Frequently... For many moons.

261
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,208
Andrea, I know what we do is a sin.

262
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,500
Do you love him?

263
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,583
With all my heart.

264
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:13,375
Then do not judge yourself as sinners.

265
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,417
When was it you last bled?

266
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:19,792
The winter months.

267
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,833
That may already be your answer.

268
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,042
But there are ways to see...

269
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,542
To know...

270
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,625
Sorry.

271
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,333
All new arrivals are requested
at the church.

272
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,333
As the leader of this community,

273
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:53,875
it seems I have failed to make clear
the rules...

274
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,250
that bind us.

275
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,083
Under no circumstances...

276
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,583
are any members of this village,
new or old,

277
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:10,542
permitted to venture out
after the ringing of the night bell.

278
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,667
But last night...

279
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:16,625
one of you...

280
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,083
broke that rule.

281
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:26,333
Kneel... if you would be so kind.

282
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,208
Book of Therese,

283
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,875
verse seven, chapter 12.

284
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,167
"For I shall profit not...

285
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,167
I will seek not..."

286
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,625
"...the gold of my brother,

287
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,417
for he hath not more than I,
nor I than him.

288
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:54,083
For my life..."

289
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,167
Shh, shh.

290
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:06,000
"For my life is not defined
by consumption,

291
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,208
wealth, and material goods.

292
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:12,208
It is an echo of my neighbor
and of my neighbor's neighbor.

293
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:14,833
We, the people of..."

294
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,208
"We, the people of Erisden,

295
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,542
stand bonded in our unity,

296
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,250
stand united through equality,

297
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,625
for we shall suffer not,

298
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,542
shall want not."

299
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:47,792
Well?

300
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:54,583
For King and country!

301
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,625
Agh!

302
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,167
This heathen land...

303
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:48,167
will... burn!

304
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,208
Agh!

305
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,208
Treat the man! Do it!

306
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,583
Agh!

307
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,833
He was from the mainland. An assassin.
His knife has the King's markings.

308
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:15,476
Did you bring anyone at all
that you weren't supposed to?

309
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,750
If the knife of that bastard
cut just one of us,

310
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,917
we all bleed together.

311
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:33,333
If your blood has been shed in my name,
I shed mine for you.

312
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,792
Father!

313
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm indebted to you, brother.

314
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,750
Your act of bravery
shall not go unrewarded.

315
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:44,333
You have my word.

316
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:50,333
Today the King sends spies.
How long before he sends ships?

317
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,333
I want spotters stationed
along the coastline.

318
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,500
Strengthen our defense.

319
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:57,250
- Load the carriages, arm the barricade.
- Aye!

320
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:59,708
- Travel to the north point.
- To the north point!

321
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,292
We're not done here yet.

322
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,542
The intruder still walks,
and we have a ransom to find.

323
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,875
All right, collect the girl.

324
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:16,625
If he insists on remaining hidden,
we'll show him the consequences.

325
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,833
Afraid I spilt a little.

326
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
How dare you!

327
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,208
How long did this collection take?

328
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:53,083
Trinkets like these
are not easily acquired.

329
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,833
My uncle.

330
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,750
My mother's kin.

331
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:58,708
He's a doctor.

332
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:02,458
Is that your mother?

333
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,750
Yes.

334
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,792
She died giving birth to me.

335
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:08,833
I'm sorry.

336
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:13,500
My uncle says I remind him of her.

337
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,875
Says it gives him peace to know
she lives through me.

338
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,917
All my life, he's been the only one
who could look at me,

339
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,583
see her, and still smile.

340
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,083
My father...

341
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,333
sometimes I can just see it his eyes.

342
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,250
A resentment.

343
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,708
Do you resent him?

344
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:40,500
- Sir?
- Your father, for bringing you here.

345
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:43,052
- Mr. Richardson...
- Don't misunderstand me.

346
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,583
I'm glad that he did, but...

347
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:48,083
You strike me as somebody
with more to give this world

348
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:50,458
than merely being the daughter
of a prophet.

349
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,917
- Do you resent yours?
- Oh, every day.

350
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,167
A few drops of these
should see you through the night.

351
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,125
I'll come by tomorrow
to change your bandages.

352
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:31,500
Thank you, Miss Howe.

353
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,250
Call to quarters!

354
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:29,125
People of Erisden!

355
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:32,292
Hear me!

356
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,250
The woman you see before you...

357
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,458
has broken the laws of our land!

358
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,625
She is an agent of a dying god...

359
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,125
and a weak King.

360
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,208
She's come here to corrupt...

361
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,917
and destroy our community!

362
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,375
But...

363
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,667
there is another.

364
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:07,208
Her kin is here also.

365
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:10,250
Co-conspirator!

366
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,958
I call to him now!

367
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,542
Make yourself known.

368
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:21,417
Make good... on the debt...

369
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,042
that she owes...

370
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:27,292
and forgiveness shall be hers.

371
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:31,250
Stay in the shadows...

372
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:36,000
and it be the Heathen's Stand
that awaits ye both!

373
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,667
Very well.

374
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:18,917
No! No!

375
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Don't! No!

376
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,083
No!

377
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:25,917
No, no!

378
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,458
Stop!

379
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,125
Stop!

380
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:32,833
Please, no!

381
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:39,000
The sands of time are sinking!

382
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,792
Her life is in your hands!

383
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:54,875
Let them play.

384
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:40,417
- You good?
- Aye.

385
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,583
We don't have the resources
for this, Malcolm.

386
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,333
These festivities will decimate
our livestock.

387
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:58,542
Celebrating our way into starvation.

388
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,167
Tonight, while they celebrate...

389
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,625
we'll search their rooms.

390
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:09,333
If he's here, we'll know it.

391
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:12,542
First, we find the money, then we'll...

392
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:17,792
Well, we'll deal with them both.
Trust me, this ends tonight.

393
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:21,625
Andrea?

394
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:35,125
Off from her, now!

395
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,417
Can we at least
afford this woman her dignity?

396
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,208
Slowly.

397
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:58,958
Slowly, or your body will reject it.

398
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,500
Thank you.

399
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,792
I'll see to it that no one harms you.
I promise.

400
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:16,750
Just hold strong.

401
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:48,625
Come on!

402
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:53,333
Get up!

403
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:01,958
Go!

404
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,375
Be ready.

405
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:23,542
Agh.

406
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:48,708
Good evening.

407
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,833
Well, hello.

408
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,125
What's all this?

409
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,750
There's more to life
than harvest and prayer, Mr. Richardson.

410
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,292
It's called "fun". You should try it.

411
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:08,250
- Thomas.
- Are you going to ask me to dance?

412
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:11,500
It would be an honor,
my lady, but...

413
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:14,250
do you think the prophet will permit?

414
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,750
I'm not sure my father would be persuaded.

415
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:22,375
I sincerely doubt he'd be happy
with hands such as these...

416
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:24,750
on the hips of his good little girl.

417
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,000
These are far from scholarly hands,
Mr. Richardson.

418
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,750
Thomas.

419
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,667
And I never proclaimed to be as such.

420
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:40,792
Your eyes...

421
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,417
they've seen things.

422
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:49,167
Who are you?

423
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,042
Will you excuse me, Andrea?

424
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:55,292
Wait.

425
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Come on.

426
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:19,875
- I found these.
- You've done well. Let's go.

427
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:53,247
Are you going...

428
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:12,375
We're wasting our time here, Quinn.

429
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,917
Every room, Malcolm.

430
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:19,292
Let's move on!

431
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:56,958
What is it?

432
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:00,958
It's the house.

433
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,042
Frank! Frank!

434
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:09,542
The house!

435
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,208
- Close it after. Don't seal it.
- Yes, sir.

436
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,958
Jeremy... if you meet any trouble...

437
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:28,708
use this.

438
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,458
No matter who it is.

439
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:35,958
Thank you.

440
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,083
Agh!

441
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:29,875
Get!

442
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:34,333
Go on, go!

443
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,125
Frank!

444
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:48,417
Frank!

445
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:49,458
Down here.

446
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:54,750
He's inside.

447
01:01:57,625 --> 01:02:00,101
Okay, Frank, take my hunting rifle,
get down there and flush him out.

448
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,708
Quinn, stand guard should he return.

449
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,375
Should be me down there.

450
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:08,333
I want him a prisoner in possession
of answers, not a corpse.

451
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:32,958
Frank.

452
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:54,375
Don't hesitate.

453
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:56,792
You see him, you shoot him.

454
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,500
Wait, don't shoot! It's me!

455
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,333
Jesus Christ, man!

456
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:07,708
Agh!

457
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,250
Ah!

458
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:40,125
What...

459
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,000
You showed yourself.

460
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:20,292
To him.

461
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,083
Why?

462
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,875
He's not to be trusted.

463
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,125
He won't worship you...

464
01:10:37,458 --> 01:10:38,458
as I.

465
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
Ah.

466
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,708
No more shall you poison our crop.

467
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:59,208
I swear you shall starve,

468
01:10:59,292 --> 01:11:01,583
lest you give us pure harvest!

469
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:57,833
No! No!

470
01:11:57,917 --> 01:11:58,917
No!

471
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:00,458
No!

472
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,333
No!

473
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,042
No!

474
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:05,417
No!

475
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:23,375
You found it.

476
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:30,375
What is this?

477
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,125
You wouldn't believe me.

478
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,500
Here.

479
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:41,125
Change into these.

480
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:05,083
What happened to you?

481
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:11,458
My faith.

482
01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:15,625
I once held fast a belief in the divine.

483
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,250
Like you, I...

484
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,792
knelt before a deity.

485
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,750
Armed with the book of Jesus Christ, I...

486
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:32,750
led my parish into the heart of Peking.

487
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:39,542
<i>And we showed them the glory
and the love of God himself...</i>

488
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,750
<i>and then they showed us the Devil.</i>

489
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:57,625
No!

490
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,542
Agh!

491
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:29,792
Blessed be, my Father,
I beg of You, hear my prayer!

492
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,375
Agh!

493
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,333
As Your faithful servant,
in this hour of need,

494
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:42,958
I pray for Your divine intervention!

495
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:44,875
Agh!

496
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:59,333
Please! Show Yourself!

497
01:15:09,917 --> 01:15:11,167
Agh!

498
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:23,042
<i>The promise of the Divine
is but an illusion.</i>

499
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,875
<i>Nothing in this world is pure...</i>

500
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:28,292
<i>except for Jennifer...</i>

501
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:29,875
<i>my sister.</i>

502
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,250
<i>Always in my heart.</i>

503
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,833
<i>She did not abandon me then...</i>

504
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:38,792
<i>and I will not abandon her now.</i>

505
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:41,125
<i>As for God,</i>

506
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:45,083
<i>he left me, left all of us to suffer.</i>

507
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,875
But you survived.

508
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:51,167
Only my body, and barely that.

509
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:53,833
God is pain...

510
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,792
is... suffering...

511
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:58,208
- is betrayal.
- Is forgiveness.

512
01:15:58,292 --> 01:15:59,292
Tsk.

513
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,208
Thomas, let me help you.

514
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:03,958
Says the daughter of the man
who wants me dead.

515
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:06,750
No. Not I, and not my father.

516
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:08,958
Child, you must be blind
to think otherwise.

517
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:13,000
He may be many things, Mr. Richardson,
but he's not a murderer.

518
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:16,125
- He wouldn't.
- Oh, he would.

519
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:18,458
And he has.

520
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:25,250
"Beware of false prophets
which come to you in sheep's clothing,

521
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:28,500
but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

522
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,167
Andrea, you know it to be true.

523
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,667
My sister...

524
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,250
is no traitor.

525
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,708
No spy.

526
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,625
She didn't come here.

527
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,333
She was taken.

528
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:33,042
Frank?

529
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:00,625
She provided for us...

530
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:02,667
once.

531
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,708
Enough of your superstition.

532
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:09,125
Where are we?

533
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,667
Worry not.
They won't know to look for you here.

534
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:29,208
It's toxic.

535
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:34,708
All the crops have become riddled
with impurities.

536
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,083
Look.

537
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:44,833
All this land...

538
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:47,792
it's scorched earth that we live upon.

539
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,417
And yet, somehow, it grows.

540
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,458
Why now?

541
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:54,667
I don't know.

542
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:57,875
Perhaps her strength is fading.

543
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,083
Or something has angered her.

544
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,458
Pregnant?

545
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:37,167
Ffion, Frank wants I should travel
with him today to the mainland.

546
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,583
Then I'll be at shore
to greet you at sunrise.

547
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,458
He wants I should stay there.

548
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,083
Jeremy...

549
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:48,000
And I want only should you be there
by my side...

550
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:51,542
as my wife.

551
01:19:57,958 --> 01:19:59,417
Well, you know yourself,

552
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:03,042
your father would never allow it.
Me, you...

553
01:20:04,708 --> 01:20:05,708
us...

554
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:07,833
our child.

555
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:12,167
We could be together...

556
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,542
any time of any day.

557
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,000
- Free.
- To love each other.

558
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,125
Wait.

559
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:31,375
Wait right here.
I have something... for us.

560
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:18,875
Father?

561
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:20,708
Father, please. I can explain.

562
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,875
Please! I was going to tell you. Please...

563
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:24,667
Agh!

564
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:27,667
Tell me now!

565
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,042
What suspicions have ye confirmed?

566
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:31,458
Father, no!

567
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:32,417
No!

568
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,833
Inform me, child!
Lest I see what ye hide!

569
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,708
It's mine to keep!

570
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:57,500
Where you going, Frank?

571
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,417
The boy and me are leaving.

572
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,208
Frank...

573
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,500
Sorry, Malcolm.

574
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:10,042
I can't be part of this anymore.
I won't.

575
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,750
This community needs you.

576
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:16,542
I need you.

577
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:18,875
You need my boat.

578
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:22,333
I was happy following you

579
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:24,333
when this was all about the word
of your heart.

580
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:25,917
Come on, Frank. This...

581
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:27,750
this is our island.

582
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,250
We built this...

583
01:22:31,042 --> 01:22:34,083
with our own hands. You, me... Quinn.

584
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:37,333
It's our paradise.

585
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:41,667
No. It's our hell,
and I'm dragging the boy down with me.

586
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,083
And you, your Andrea.

587
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:45,458
No, no.

588
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,333
No, no, you're wrong, Frank.

589
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:50,750
We have homes here. We have families.

590
01:22:51,917 --> 01:22:53,917
- We have faith.
- Oh, faith...

591
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:59,250
We have a god in chains
poisoning us from the inside out.

592
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:02,333
We have an innocent man's blood
on our hands.

593
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:05,500
We have a kidnapped girl, held for ransom.

594
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:09,708
I'll go to my grave washing the blood
of that wee soul from my hands.

595
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:13,250
This place, this community, it's broken.

596
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:14,417
Then we'll fix it!

597
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:23,875
Together.

598
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,583
It's finished.

599
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:30,042
You know it in your heart.

600
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:38,958
Whose is it?

601
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:44,333
Who put that inside you?

602
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:45,875
Please...

603
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:48,958
Father, do not see it
for the judgment of his actions.

604
01:23:49,042 --> 01:23:50,875
Oh, no. No, no, no.

605
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:52,458
Pray no.

606
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:56,333
- Not him.
- He followed only what I asked.

607
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:01,875
This is a harlot's tongue!

608
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:05,500
Them be a whore's lips
that move before me!

609
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,250
Look into my eyes,

610
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:11,958
and see the daughter that stands
frightened and in need of a father's love!

611
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:16,333
You have no idea
what monstrosity grows inside you!

612
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:20,542
This is an abomination!

613
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:24,375
- A bastard mongoloid breed!
- No!

614
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,208
To be born in lumps of twisted flesh
no mother would ever call her own.

615
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:30,833
- No!
- Yes... child.

616
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:33,833
I've seen it.

617
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:37,167
I've seen it.

618
01:24:38,667 --> 01:24:39,792
That thing...

619
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,500
It will kill you.

620
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,417
I won't stand for it.

621
01:24:57,667 --> 01:24:58,667
Here.

622
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:01,042
No! No!

623
01:25:01,083 --> 01:25:02,458
No! Stop!

624
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,500
Ffion?

625
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,292
You did this.

626
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:39,208
You put your seed...

627
01:25:40,625 --> 01:25:42,833
inside my beautiful angel.

628
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:54,167
I had no choice.

629
01:25:58,833 --> 01:25:59,917
My Ffion.

630
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:02,875
My daughter!

631
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:05,750
And you...

632
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:09,125
took her from me.

633
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:19,833
Agh!

634
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,750
Agh!

635
01:26:37,667 --> 01:26:38,667
Agh!

636
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,208
Agh! Agh!

637
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:03,667
Help!

638
01:27:04,042 --> 01:27:05,833
Help! Help!

639
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,625
Help! Help!

640
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:10,542
Somebody help!

641
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:12,375
He killed her!

642
01:27:13,292 --> 01:27:14,833
He killed my girl!

643
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:16,625
No...

644
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:17,833
No, I didn't.

645
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,625
Murderer!

646
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,833
Don't let him escape!

647
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:23,458
After him!

648
01:27:24,625 --> 01:27:25,625
After him!

649
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:27,333
This way!

650
01:27:42,542 --> 01:27:44,542
Prepare the Heathen's Stand!

651
01:27:46,167 --> 01:27:48,917
By order of purification!

652
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,125
But, sir, only Prophet Malcolm...

653
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:54,667
Malcolm is not the divine ruler
of this land!

654
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:00,917
Now, follow my orders.

655
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,458
Or I swear...

656
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:06,042
by the blood of my kin...

657
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,833
ye shall face the same fate.

658
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,750
Now!

659
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:17,875
Sound the alarm.

660
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,375
What's happening?

661
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:09,708
Andrea!

662
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:12,208
Jeremy! Jeremy!

663
01:29:12,292 --> 01:29:15,333
Please, help me. I didn't hurt her.
I swear I didn't touch her!

664
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:17,542
What are you talking about?
What's happened?

665
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:20,375
Jeremy, where is Ffion?

666
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:24,792
I didn't do it! It was him.
He ripped our child from her!

667
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,500
- Jeremy!
- Get back!

668
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:32,042
The boy killed her.
He needs to be purified.

669
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,375
- No!
- Pick him up!

670
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:34,375
No!

671
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:35,458
Jeremy!

672
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:37,625
Jeremy!

673
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:40,833
Listen to his words!

674
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,167
Listen!

675
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:45,750
Jeremy! Agh!

676
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:47,042
Please!

677
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,125
Please!

678
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,125
No! Stop, please!

679
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:43,333
Lift!

680
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:53,625
You monster!

681
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:57,125
Restrain him!

682
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:00,750
You know that boy would never hurt Ffion.

683
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:03,125
He has nothing but love
in his heart for her.

684
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Is this the love of which you speak?

685
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:23,875
I, a father...

686
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:27,208
robbed of kin,

687
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:30,708
even in this,

688
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:34,708
a moment of unforgiving grief,

689
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:38,458
am merciful.

690
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:41,958
Am I not?

691
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:47,917
- How could you? How could you?
- He shall be cleansed...

692
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,917
Please!

693
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,542
...according to the edict of this land.

694
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:54,375
Don't let this happen!
Please, don't let this happen!

695
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:56,792
Oh, please! Please!

696
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:58,000
Let us begin.

697
01:33:06,917 --> 01:33:08,333
I've wanted this.

698
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:46,208
Agh...

699
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:47,375
I grant unto thee...

700
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:50,333
this symbol of purity.

701
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,583
Let it guide you.

702
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:07,583
Pray for him.

703
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,167
Quinn?

704
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:17,708
Jeremy?

705
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:19,958
My boy!

706
01:35:20,417 --> 01:35:21,625
My boy!

707
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:23,917
Take him.

708
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:26,833
Why?

709
01:35:27,417 --> 01:35:29,917
Tragedy befalls us both, my friend.

710
01:35:30,417 --> 01:35:32,208
Your boy took my Ffion.

711
01:35:32,292 --> 01:35:33,667
No, not my boy!

712
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:36,167
- What have you done?
- I have brought justice.

713
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:37,708
Give me my boy!

714
01:35:38,458 --> 01:35:39,458
No.

715
01:35:40,042 --> 01:35:41,792
No, you have no right.

716
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:45,667
- I am still the leader of this land!
- Not anymore!

717
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:48,833
This man be a false prophet!

718
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:51,000
He is weak.

719
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:53,042
We've suffered for it.

720
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:55,125
I have faltered, aye.

721
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,875
And I am repentant.

722
01:35:58,458 --> 01:36:00,042
We can rebuild anew.

723
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:01,417
Ask yourselves...

724
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:04,500
who will see us through
these dark days?

725
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:08,125
Who will see to it
that this land sustains us?

726
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:11,667
Who... will drive a spear

727
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:16,125
through the hearts
of those that oppose our god?

728
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:18,750
- But at what cost?
- Whatever it takes.

729
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:23,625
Prove yourself.

730
01:36:25,667 --> 01:36:29,000
This man... is the enemy
we have long sought.

731
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,292
He seeks to destroy...

732
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:33,667
our way of life.

733
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:37,542
We demand justice!

734
01:36:39,083 --> 01:36:40,083
Do we not?

735
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:47,250
Before the eyes of your child...

736
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:49,625
and all that doubt you...

737
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:52,458
take this man's life.

738
01:37:07,667 --> 01:37:08,667
Father, don't.

739
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,500
Hush, child.

740
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:16,833
Lift him.

741
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:27,708
Father, do not mistake this man
as thy enemy.

742
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:29,792
Trust me, child, I do not mistake him.

743
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:34,583
- I know who this man really is.
- As do I of you!

744
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,792
Please be not who I fear you have become.

745
01:37:57,292 --> 01:37:58,833
What are you doing, Frank?

746
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:00,917
Stay back! This has to end.

747
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:04,458
- Frank? Wait!
- She has to die.

748
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,500
Father!

749
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:21,667
Thomas, stop it. Please! Please...

750
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,292
This way!

751
01:39:50,292 --> 01:39:51,333
Burn it all down.

752
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:10,458
Enough!

753
01:41:11,292 --> 01:41:12,292
Go.

754
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:16,917
- Take your hand off my gun, Malcolm.
- It's over, Quinn. Look at him.

755
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,875
- Let go!
- I said look at him!

756
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:31,500
Quinn..

757
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,500
Agh!

758
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:44,500
Jen.

759
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:45,958
Ssh. It's Thomas.

760
01:43:46,042 --> 01:43:48,167
It's Tom, it's Tom. Ssh.

761
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,458
Ssh. It's Tom.

762
01:43:51,917 --> 01:43:54,083
I'm going to get you out,
I'll get you out.

763
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:55,333
I'll get you out.

764
01:44:00,417 --> 01:44:01,583
Ssh. I've got you.

765
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:03,500
Ssh, ssh.

766
01:44:14,708 --> 01:44:16,417
Jennifer! Jennifer! Jennifer!

767
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,958
- Thomas!
- Ssh, ssh.

768
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,625
Ssh, ssh.

769
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:22,708
Let me see you. Let me see you.

770
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:26,375
- I can't.
- I know. I know. Ssh.

771
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I am going to get you out of here.

772
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:30,792
Ssh.

773
01:44:30,875 --> 01:44:33,333
Father... They told me you were dead.

774
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,625
Well, to him, I was.

775
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:36,875
But I'm here now...

776
01:44:37,917 --> 01:44:38,917
for you.

777
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:49,125
Upon bended knee,
I call upon Thee.

778
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:51,792
Please, Lord...

779
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:55,500
protect me in my hour of need.

780
01:45:58,208 --> 01:45:59,875
And watch over my father.

781
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:06,792
Guide me as I seek solace...

782
01:46:07,458 --> 01:46:10,125
from the hurt of those
who wish to inflict it.

783
01:46:11,375 --> 01:46:12,750
I beg of You...

784
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,750
hear my prayer.

785
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:31,625
Aaaagghh!

786
01:46:31,708 --> 01:46:33,208
Aagh!

787
01:46:33,292 --> 01:46:35,000
Aagh...

788
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:37,250
Aaagghh...

789
01:46:58,792 --> 01:47:00,250
Aaaggh!

790
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:02,833
Agh!

791
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:04,917
Aaaagghh!

792
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,333
Agghh...

793
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:10,083
Aagghh!

794
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,500
Aaagghh!

795
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,500
Agh!

796
01:47:17,792 --> 01:47:20,000
Aaagghh...

797
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:21,667
Aagh...

798
01:47:22,792 --> 01:47:24,875
Aa-aagghh...

799
01:47:25,875 --> 01:47:27,167
Aagghh...

800
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:29,125
Aagh...

801
01:47:29,208 --> 01:47:30,458
Aaagghhh!

802
01:47:30,542 --> 01:47:32,625
Aa-aagh!

803
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:37,292
Aaagghh!

804
01:47:37,375 --> 01:47:38,583
Aagh!

805
01:47:49,042 --> 01:47:52,083
Aaagghh!

806
01:48:57,167 --> 01:48:58,167
Agh!

807
01:48:58,667 --> 01:48:59,917
Agh!

808
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:12,833
Agh!

809
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:05,292
Oh, how I've waited for you, my son.

810
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:18,875
How dare you!

811
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:21,208
My father will see to it that you never...

812
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:23,000
Your father can't help you no more, child.

813
01:51:24,083 --> 01:51:25,167
I saw to it.

814
01:51:27,667 --> 01:51:28,667
No.

815
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:33,208
<i>Years...</i>

816
01:51:34,167 --> 01:51:36,750
<i>I've sat and watched...</i>

817
01:51:37,792 --> 01:51:41,208
as those ingrates
gave thanks to your father.

818
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:44,500
False prophet...

819
01:51:45,208 --> 01:51:47,167
hiding behind a false god!

820
01:51:49,542 --> 01:51:51,125
I should have had that praise!

821
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:54,208
<i>Should have been me they thanked!</i>

822
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,875
<i>After all, it was I that imprisoned her.</i>

823
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,167
<i>I, who discovered
what she could do for us.</i>

824
01:52:17,125 --> 01:52:18,292
Hold her legs down!

825
01:52:55,792 --> 01:52:58,625
Set me free, my child.

826
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:24,583
Forgive me.

827
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:43,208
<i>Your father was right about her.</i>

828
01:54:43,708 --> 01:54:46,917
<i>You put a god between your enemy
and the people,</i>

829
01:54:47,667 --> 01:54:51,333
<i>put the word of the Almighty
between the crosshairs of their muskets,</i>

830
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:52,542
<i>you'll see!</i>

831
01:54:53,292 --> 01:54:56,708
<i>The people won't falter... not one bit!</i>

832
01:54:57,833 --> 01:54:58,833
<i>Faith...</i>

833
01:54:59,958 --> 01:55:01,292
<i>binds you.</i>

834
01:55:02,167 --> 01:55:03,167
<i>God...</i>

835
01:55:03,792 --> 01:55:05,000
slave...

836
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:07,375
mine!

837
01:55:10,042 --> 01:55:11,042
But she's no god.

838
01:55:13,333 --> 01:55:14,458
She's just a machine.

839
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:16,917
You feed her...

840
01:55:17,458 --> 01:55:18,458
and she...

841
01:55:19,917 --> 01:55:20,917
delivers.

842
01:55:29,417 --> 01:55:30,417
Malcolm...

843
01:55:32,167 --> 01:55:33,250
he was soft.

844
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:39,042
When the blood of the animals
stopped working...

845
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:42,542
he tried to feed her himself.

846
01:55:43,833 --> 01:55:44,833
Hm?

847
01:55:46,417 --> 01:55:48,333
He fell victim... to faith.

848
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,375
He would have let us all starve.

849
01:55:55,167 --> 01:55:57,167
Instead of doing what needed to be done.

850
01:55:57,667 --> 01:56:00,542
Instead of feeding her
what she needed to be fed.

851
01:56:13,417 --> 01:56:14,417
Look above you.

852
01:56:16,833 --> 01:56:18,083
That will be your sun...

853
01:56:19,292 --> 01:56:20,375
your cloud...

854
01:56:21,292 --> 01:56:22,333
your moon...

855
01:56:23,792 --> 01:56:26,125
your only way of knowing
that a day has passed.

856
01:56:27,875 --> 01:56:28,875
And many will.

857
01:56:33,125 --> 01:56:34,708
For I will save this village.

858
01:56:37,417 --> 01:56:38,417
You...

859
01:56:41,125 --> 01:56:42,625
will avail your bodies to me.

860
01:56:45,292 --> 01:56:46,583
And when it is ripened...

861
01:56:47,833 --> 01:56:49,083
I will feed her...

862
01:56:49,917 --> 01:56:52,333
the flesh of your womb.

863
01:56:53,375 --> 01:56:54,375
And every year...

864
01:56:56,167 --> 01:56:57,250
we shall celebrate.

865
01:56:57,333 --> 01:56:58,458
Fire!

866
01:56:59,375 --> 01:57:00,750
Fire!

867
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,167
Brothers!

868
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:15,250
Sisters!

869
01:57:15,625 --> 01:57:16,833
Your Bibles!

870
01:57:16,917 --> 01:57:18,208
Your texts!

871
01:57:18,292 --> 01:57:19,667
We must leave this island now!

872
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:22,125
Quinn! Where's Quinn?

873
01:57:22,208 --> 01:57:24,167
He took her! He took Andrea!

874
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:25,958
- Where?
- The church!

875
01:57:26,042 --> 01:57:29,792
- Don't let the boat leave without her.
- May God be with you, Mr. Richardson.

876
01:57:30,375 --> 01:57:31,542
And also with you.

877
01:57:36,042 --> 01:57:37,250
Unchain us!

878
01:57:47,417 --> 01:57:48,958
Consider it a mercy.

879
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:55,458
Agh!

880
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:11,208
Aaagh!

881
01:58:11,625 --> 01:58:12,625
Agh!

882
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:27,208
No! No!

883
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:17,542
Aaagghhh...

884
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,792
Aaaghh...!

885
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:43,500
The boat's waiting for you.

886
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,375
For all of us.

887
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,042
We have to go.

888
02:00:42,625 --> 02:00:43,875
No! Thomas!

889
02:00:43,958 --> 02:00:46,500
- Go! Leave me...
- No!

890
02:00:46,583 --> 02:00:49,500
- You'll never make it.
- No! I can't leave you.

891
02:00:49,583 --> 02:00:51,708
You have to. Look at me, Jen.

892
02:00:51,792 --> 02:00:54,000
- Please...
- I can't feel my legs.

893
02:00:54,125 --> 02:00:55,805
I don't want to lose you again.

894
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:57,958
You never did,
and you never will.

895
02:00:59,542 --> 02:01:01,083
Don't do this...

896
02:01:01,583 --> 02:01:02,583
Not now!

897
02:01:02,917 --> 02:01:06,750
This world... has taken so much from me.

898
02:01:07,708 --> 02:01:11,583
But in all my pain,
even in my darkest days,

899
02:01:11,667 --> 02:01:15,417
I swore...
I swore it would never take you.

900
02:01:18,458 --> 02:01:21,375
Now go, get on that boat,

901
02:01:21,458 --> 02:01:25,375
live, and be the light
that guides me to eternity.

902
02:01:31,792 --> 02:01:33,250
Always in my heart.

903
02:01:37,458 --> 02:01:39,917
And you... And you in mine.

904
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,500
Pray for me.

905
02:02:44,167 --> 02:02:46,167
Come, children! Quickly!

906
02:02:47,125 --> 02:02:48,292
Join the boat!

907
02:02:49,042 --> 02:02:50,250
We leave now!
