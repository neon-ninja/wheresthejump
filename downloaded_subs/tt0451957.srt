1
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,736
- I don't know.
- Seriously, I don't think...

2
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,806
This is stupid.

3
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,609
God, Grace.

4
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,609
Thank you, it's beautiful.

5
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,955
Thanks.

6
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,088
You look great.

7
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,744
How did Dawn take the news?
The break-up and all.

8
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,845
She'll get over it.

9
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,594
Don't you move. Be right back.

10
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,003
Time for the girls
to get a little shut-eye.

11
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,775
This one's for the hippie chick.
Oh, yeah.

12
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,426
Thank you.

13
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,096
Here you go.

14
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,201
Sorry. I was so thirsty.

15
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,671
Everyone is staring at us.

16
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,551
You are so much more beautiful
than you think you are.

17
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,431
You want to go someplace
more comfortable?

18
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,310
You want to go someplace?

19
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,065
I didn't even know the door
was there.

20
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,208
- All right, here we go.
- I don't feel well.

21
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,273
Let me go. Stop.

22
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,779
Mary, help.

23
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,774
What's going on?

24
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,050
Do you think he would
ever touch you?

25
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,784
No!

26
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,219
Willy!

27
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,093
- Get her! She's sober. She'll squeal.
- Willy, get up, man.

28
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,541
Come on, Mary!

29
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,312
Help!

30
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,617
Mary!

31
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,012
Mary! Mary!

32
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,129
Mary!

33
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,438
Come on, Mary.

34
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,583
We're just having some fun.

35
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,980
- Let's just talk.
- Get away from me.

36
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,745
Hey.

37
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,946
Come on.

38
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:30,058
It's gonna be all right. Your friends
are okay. It's all right, it's okay.

39
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,858
It's just a little prank.

40
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,870
Come on.

41
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,473
Let's go check on your friends.

42
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,217
You stupid bitch!

43
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,592
Mary?

44
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,193
Mary.

45
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,106
Oh, shit.

46
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,867
Oh, shit.

47
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,244
I'm sorry.

48
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,354
Oh, shit.

49
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,128
Oh, shit.

50
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,203
There you are.

51
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,745
Where's the girl?

52
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,407
I don't know. I thought she
was in here, but she's not.

53
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,418
- Shit.
- She probably passed out somewhere.

54
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,591
Come on, we gotta find her.

55
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,891
<i>That was over 30 years ago,
but her rotting body is still there...</i>

56
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,895
...waiting to be discovered.

57
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,931
Bullshit.

58
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,627
Bullshit.

59
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:23,434
No, it's true. I swear to God. My mom
told me in complete confidence.

60
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,372
Well, complete confidence...

61
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,604
...doesn't mean much when
you drink vodka like it's water.

62
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,407
Shut up.

63
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,109
- Stop it!
- So you don't think it's unhealthy...

64
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,618
...for them to stay home
on their own homecoming?

65
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,724
Not everybody wants to
be homecoming queen.

66
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,492
It didn't hurt me.

67
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,696
You're right.

68
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,328
- And I only wish I could've been there.
- No, you were too old and serious.

69
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,332
Thanks a lot.

70
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,298
That story doesn't make any sense.

71
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,737
I mean, why don't the girls stick
up for themselves? I don't get it.

72
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,470
Maybe if you weren't always speaking
out, like in the school newspaper...

73
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,410
...maybe we'd have dates
to the homecoming dance.

74
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,516
Okay, so you changed your mind.

75
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,618
You think it's fair football players
get academic credit...

76
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,118
...for going to practice?

77
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,019
You shouldn't have published
the picture with the article.

78
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,853
They took the picture as a joke. You
published it out of context, without...

79
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,122
Guys. I've got another ghost story.

80
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,697
That wasn't a ghost story, Mindy.
It's an urban legend.

81
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,702
An urban legend is a made-up story
people keep telling as if it was true.

82
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,339
Like the guy who eats Pop Rocks...

83
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,338
...drinks soda
and his stomach explodes.

84
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,341
Like that bullshit about Mindy's
brother's camp counselor...

85
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,879
...getting his arm stuck in a soda
machine, and it falls on top of him.

86
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,176
That wasn't bullshit.

87
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,682
And it was a candy machine.

88
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,015
- Oh, and like Bloody Mary.
- Who's that?

89
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,351
Supposedly, if you go into
the bathroom and turn off the lights...

90
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,961
...and chant "Bloody Mary" three times
into the mirror, she appears.

91
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,662
Her face is like a corpse.
And if you look at her, well...

92
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,334
...then you have to turn the lights
back on before she drags you in.

93
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,070
In where?

94
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,068
I don't know. In the mirror?

95
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,835
I heard she'll haunt you forever.

96
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,077
That's not even a real urban legend.
That's just like that movie <i>Candyman</i>.

97
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,413
- Well, my story was real.
- As real as your mother's new tits.

98
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,394
What's the first thing you'll do
when you're mayor?

99
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,660
- I haven't won yet.
- But you will.

100
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,061
A lot can happen, so...

101
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,197
But so far...

102
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,306
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.

103
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,942
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do
is propose a 9 p.m. Curfew...

104
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,915
...on all teenage girls.

105
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,281
I'll keep them off the streets,
keep them safe.

106
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,013
Keep them virgins.

107
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,624
I'm afraid that might be too late.

108
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,943
Bloody Mary.

109
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,979
Bloody Mary.

110
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,356
Bloody Mary.

111
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,959
Who is it?

112
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,166
David.

113
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,869
Asshole.

114
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,000
So, David, you're back early.
Shouldn't you be at the dance?

115
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,974
- I'm sure it's still going on.
- Oh, yeah. Well...

116
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,306
I was there long enough
not to see any of you.

117
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,983
We didn't want to go that
stupid popularity contest.

118
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,652
And why is that?
Oh, because you couldn't get dates?

119
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,312
Yep, that's exactly what happened.
Football team put us on the blacklist.

120
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,120
We could've gone.

121
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,318
We just preferred to stay here
and have some female bonding.

122
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,322
Hey, Mindy. Nice.

123
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,960
- Shut up.
- David!

124
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,035
Oh, and just so you guys
get it right...

125
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,965
<i>... Candyman</i> ripped off Bloody Mary
in the first place.

126
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,407
Not the other way around.

127
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,712
How long was your brother
outside listening to us?

128
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,712
- Long enough to masturbate.
- Not long at all, then.

129
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,102
David.

130
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,543
So how was it?

131
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,239
Just like yours, I'm sure.

132
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,384
You didn't wake up naked in Tijuana.

133
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,214
Just because there's a dead
Mexican hooker in my room...

134
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,287
...doesn't mean I went to Mexico.

135
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,222
Oh, Bill drank all my lemonade.

136
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,761
David, be nice. You know, and you
could call him "Dad" once in a while.

137
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,290
Never happen.

138
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,197
But I still call you "Mom."

139
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,375
Mom, I need 100 bucks.

140
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,703
Do me a favor.
Go wake up the girls.

141
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,748
All right. Just because you own me,
it doesn't mean I'm your slave.

142
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,078
- Go.
- Yeah.

143
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,381
They're already gone.

144
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,680
She's never done this before.
I mean, this is so unusual for her.

145
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,010
- I have to call Sheriff McKenna.
- Okay.

146
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,084
Yeah, Sheriff McKenna.

147
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,017
It's Bill Owens.

148
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,520
Any word, anything?

149
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,022
<i>We're doing all we can.
You have to understand...</i>

150
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,422
<i>... they're not officially
missing for 24 hours.</i>

151
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,927
- Yeah, but they are missing.
- Hello.

152
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:57,501
That's it, nothing? All right, well,
you just stay on top of this.

153
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,638
All right, look, when
do we call in the FBI?

154
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,206
<i>Our hands are tied.
We'll do all we can locally.</i>

155
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,206
<i>Officially missing for 24 hours.</i>

156
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,708
<i>But they are missing.</i>

157
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,575
Right this way, sheriff.

158
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,818
- Sheriff. Thanks for coming.
- Hi, Bill.

159
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,715
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

160
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,707
The mountain gorilla.

161
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,751
An endangered species native
to Central Africa. Mountain gorillas...

162
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,616
...live in groups...

163
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,620
...ruled by a dominant male...

164
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,359
...which determines
the group's daily activities...

165
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:04,066
...and enforces
a very strict social order.

166
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,634
The silverback.

167
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,270
Do you think Samantha
and her friends are okay?

168
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,774
Yeah.

169
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:18,507
- And consume 20 times
their weight in food annually.

170
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,381
I just spoke to Sheriff McKenna,
and he's got all his men out searching.

171
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,256
- They're gonna find her.
- Sure, that's easy for you to say.

172
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,926
She's just your stepdaughter.

173
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,794
What...?

174
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,368
Sam.

175
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,479
Oh, my God!

176
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,880
Oh, my God.

177
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,924
They all say the same thing.
They woke up in the basement...

178
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,619
...of the abandoned old mill
on the other side of the state park.

179
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,265
The door was locked.
Well, that's what they said.

180
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,298
What do you mean?

181
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,494
Well, we're gonna check it out.
They don't remember anything.

182
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,300
Other than that, they're fine. Weren't
harmed or mistreated, nothing.

183
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:22,506
We ran blood tests and found
traces of Rohypnol in their system.

184
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,716
It's a date-rape drug.

185
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,247
You don't have to worry about that.
We ran medical tests.

186
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,854
They were not abused in that way.

187
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,991
So, what do you think?

188
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,859
Well, it could be the girls' idea
of a practical joke.

189
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,231
You know, for attention.

190
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,695
What happened?

191
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,075
What happened? What's wrong?

192
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,039
What's wrong?
What happened to you?

193
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,146
My mom says that it's all a stunt.
That they did it to themselves.

194
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,759
Samantha will write a story
about it for the paper.

195
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,555
Some people have no boundaries.

196
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,792
Some people need to mind
their own fucking business.

197
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,119
The girls are back.

198
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,618
They were in science class.

199
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,056
Took them long enough.

200
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,731
You'd think twins would have
some kind of sixth sense...

201
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,032
...like I'd know what happened to you.

202
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,573
We're fraternal, not identical.

203
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,845
How you holding up?

204
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,935
It was Buck and his friends,
wasn't it?

205
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,640
He told us they just wanted to talk.

206
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,485
You are butt-white.

207
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,452
- Hey, Roger.
- What?

208
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,252
You need to spend some more time
at that tanning salon.

209
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,894
Hey, girls dig it, man.

210
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,355
He doesn't go to that salon
to go tanning.

211
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,328
He goes to hook up with that chick.

212
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,765
- The one with the big tits.
- Oh, yeah.

213
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,203
Buck.

214
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,710
- What's up?
- Come here. Come here, check it out.

215
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,435
What? Oh, yeah.

216
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,518
I know it was you. All of you.
I know it was all of you.

217
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,151
What did your sister...?

218
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,179
We don't know what
you're talking about.

219
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,915
We were at the dance all night.
Ask our dates.

220
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,829
- Get out of here, loser.
- You little punk.

221
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,498
- Yeah. Get out of here.
- Get out of here, man.

222
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,167
- Get lost.
- You're not gonna get away with this.

223
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,166
- Whatever.
- Oh, I'm scared.

224
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,741
- Come on, get out of here.
- That's what I thought.

225
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,739
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

226
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,005
- We got a problem.
- This is not a problem at all.

227
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,249
Those bitches,
they won't say anything.

228
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,751
Yeah. Take Buck's advice.

229
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,455
What did you get
on your SATs, Buck? Seven hundred?

230
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,252
Total.

231
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,855
What's that supposed to mean?

232
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,559
You're such an asshole.

233
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,742
She needs to relax.

234
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,980
See you later, mama's boy.

235
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,306
Shut up. Shut up.

236
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,272
No way. Shut up.

237
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:33,022
Yeah. Totally. Shut up.

238
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:43,266
She did not. No way.

239
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,633
Oh, my God. He's here.
I gotta let you go.

240
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,432
Hi, Roger.

241
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,769
Hi, Betsy. I hope it's okay
I just showed up.

242
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,175
Don't worry about it.
I'm, like, the only one here.

243
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,782
I just wanna catch some sun.

244
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,653
Lay on the bed a little bit,
get my groove on.

245
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,418
Then maybe I could get
some of your sunshine.

246
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,757
Okay.

247
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,780
How long do you want it?

248
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,214
Just leave it on low.
I'm gonna relax for a bit.

249
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,012
I'll get out when I'm done.

250
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,086
I'll be ready.

251
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,174
Totally. Like, yeah, I saw it.

252
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,470
He is so hot.

253
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,209
Yeah, totally. Most people go nude.

254
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,914
Totally.

255
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,698
Yeah. Totally.

256
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,502
No. Totally.

257
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:43,880
Yeah.

258
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,063
Totally.

259
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,433
Shut up.

260
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,470
Help! Betsy!

261
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,040
Yes way. My past.
I could be president.

262
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,319
What time is it?

263
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,325
Oh, shit. Roger!

264
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,095
Oh, shit.

265
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,734
Roger! Roger! Roger!

266
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,803
- Amen.
- Amen.

267
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,024
Peace be with you.

268
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,850
Thank you, Father.

269
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,003
Samantha?

270
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,844
Samantha?

271
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,212
- Hey.
- Hey.

272
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,411
I brought you homework you might
have missed when you were gone.

273
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,593
I saw how Buck was looking
at David at the funeral.

274
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:40,964
Heather, you know that David had
nothing to do with Roger's accident.

275
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,827
Yeah.

276
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,527
Listen...

277
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,430
...I know that things have
been difficult for us.

278
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,068
It was so much easier
when we were kids.

279
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,237
God, Sam, we were so close.
What happened to us?

280
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,380
It's funny you should say that.

281
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,212
Why?

282
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:08,550
Because it sounds like it came
from a TV movie, that's why.

283
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,161
Look, what happened to you was
just a little payback prank...

284
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,160
...and I had nothing to do with it.

285
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,594
The guys didn't mean
to go so far...

286
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,269
...but they were pissed off
you published that photo.

287
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,768
Just a prank?

288
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,440
They drugged us,
and who knows what they did to us...

289
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,338
...after they locked us up.
I sure as hell don't.

290
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,274
How hard was it
to crawl out the window?

291
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,176
That's not the point, Heather.

292
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,883
Look, Sam, there's more.

293
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,188
It's...

294
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,960
- This has all happened before.
- What do you mean?

295
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,267
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

296
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,940
Make sure and do
your history homework.

297
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,909
I'm sorry.

298
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,345
She brought me my homework.

299
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,556
She felt bad. She was cool about it.

300
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,441
Damn it.

301
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:06,654
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

302
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,047
Heather!

303
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,501
Heather!

304
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,285
Heather!

305
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,422
Heather!

306
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,737
Heather!

307
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,972
Heather!

308
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,086
Heather!

309
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,722
Heather!

310
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,305
Oh, my God!

311
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,814
<i>Unit 14, we have a 174...</i>

312
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,853
What's going on?

313
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,690
What happened?

314
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,629
Sam, what...? Sam, talk to me.
What's going on?

315
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,360
Ashes to ashes...

316
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,731
...and dust to dust.

317
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,722
She was in bed. How could they
be crawling out of her face?

318
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,690
I think it's really sick, though.

319
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,865
They were coming out of her face.

320
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:03,567
Now, I'm sure you've all noticed the
new security precautions on campus.

321
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:08,211
Every effort is being made
to keep our students safe.

322
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,839
Now, Principal Rosetti
has asked me to remind everyone...

323
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,855
Samantha, dear.

324
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,091
Is something the matter?

325
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,063
No.

326
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,005
Well, as I was saying...

327
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,113
...students who need to speak to
a counselor should tell their advisor.

328
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,312
So how was school today, honey?

329
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,393
I saw a ghost in science class.

330
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,406
Do you really think
that he did it to himself?

331
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,280
Roger Dalton was dumb...

332
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,787
...but don't you think that he would
wake up before he cooked his ass?

333
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,288
What are you saying?

334
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,562
I'm asking if you really think there's
nothing more to our friends dying.

335
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:38,426
Heather dropped some acid and
just ripped her face off like a mask?

336
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,131
Of course not.

337
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,967
She didn't even drink,
let alone do drugs.

338
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:49,345
There's something wrong
in our little town, and it has a name.

339
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,242
- Owens.
- David?

340
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,509
Both of them.
They were there both times.

341
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,981
Jesus, Buck.

342
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,815
Murder?

343
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,185
So, what are we gonna do?

344
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,521
Your dad still have
those emergency gas cans?

345
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,393
Get them.

346
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,132
And meet me behind the park
at midnight.

347
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,806
I don't know about this, Buck.

348
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,272
Come on. Scaring the girls
is one thing, but...

349
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,546
Right.

350
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,686
Okay.

351
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,551
I'll be there in 15.

352
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,089
Holy shit, this guy's dick
is smoking. Hey, McKenna...

353
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,289
...better check your beer bottle tonight.

354
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,628
Did you ever hear the story about
a guy who was drinking a beer...

355
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,270
...and found a finger in the bottle?
Look at this.

356
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,167
Someone cut his ring finger off.

357
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,636
- Wild.
- Will you stop with that crap?

358
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,937
That finger is probably
some coyote's lunch.

359
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,173
Yeah, we got EMTs on the scene.

360
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,080
<i>Worthington High School classes
have been cancelled today.</i>

361
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,517
<i>Another student from that school</i>
w<i>as found dead.</i>

362
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,247
<i>Although drunk and driving...</i>

363
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,586
<i>... early reports suggest electrocution
as the cause of death.</i>

364
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,127
<i>Tom Higgins,
a varsity football player...</i>

365
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,071
There's something else
going on here.

366
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,211
Heather left this in my
American history book the other night.

367
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,152
I think someone sent this
to Heather as a warning.

368
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,481
This is the same thing
that happened to you.

369
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,390
Only I'm still alive.

370
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,387
Here.

371
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,329
Read the other one.

372
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,368
"Professor at Alpine University kills
students using urban legends as m.o."

373
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,732
Wait, you think there's
a copycat killer...

374
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,373
...that's killing our friends.

375
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,908
No, I just think that Heather
was trying to tell me something.

376
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,245
I need your help to figure it out.

377
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,849
Well, it's about time you asked.

378
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:52,350
Mary Banner lived here in Utah.
She went to Worthington High.

379
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,751
It says the other two girls
returned home unharmed.

380
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,724
They should still be alive.
See if you can find it online.

381
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:02,228
Are you smoking crack? This is
dial-up. Let's use the school database.

382
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,426
- School's closed today.
- I have keys to the newspaper office.

383
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,135
Okay.

384
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,413
Let's just get down there
and finish this.

385
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,969
Wait, wait, go back.

386
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,131
- There.
- Wow, déjà vu.

387
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,437
"The two girls,
seniors at Worthington High...

388
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,615
...refused to press charges
against unknown assailants."

389
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,545
Why no names?

390
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:59,621
Got them. Gina Lotnick, 17, Mary
Banner, 18, and Grace Taylor, 17.

391
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,951
Where are they now?

392
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,495
Oh, that's from '82.

393
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,664
"Local resident Gina Lotnick
died this morning...

394
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,803
...of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

395
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,667
Miss Lotnick was one of the victims in
the homecoming kidnapping in 1969...

396
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,502
...of which there are no suspects.

397
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,974
Mary Banner, another victim, was
never found and presumed dead."

398
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,341
- Who was the other girl?
- Grace Taylor.

399
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,814
"The only remaining survivor
of that fateful night is Grace Taylor."

400
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,681
Hey, got it. It's not that far
from our house.

401
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,220
Hey.

402
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,018
Hey, Coach Jacoby.

403
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,857
What are you kids up to?

404
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,496
Oh, nothing.
Just some extra credit, you know.

405
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,030
The school's closed.

406
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,861
And that goes for your newspaper.

407
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,204
You're gonna have to leave.

408
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:52,535
- Now.
- All right, cool. Thanks, coach.

409
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,839
- Hey.
- I just feel like I'm cracking up.

410
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:32,175
I know it's tough, but we shouldn't
blame this on a bunch of ghost stories.

411
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,351
I don't know what to believe.

412
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,081
These just seem
like awfully big coincidences.

413
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,586
They're odd, I'll give you that.

414
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,418
They're either accidents,
or there's a killer out there.

415
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,424
There's no ghost.

416
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,756
But there is something.

417
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,868
I mean, there's something connecting
this to what happened to me...

418
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,038
...to those girls in '69.

419
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,934
We're gonna find out what it is.

420
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,541
Grace Taylor is gonna tell us.

421
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:12,117
- This is it?
- Yeah, it's groovy.

422
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,417
Come on.

423
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,833
Power to the people.
Free Angela Davis. What's up?

424
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:27,761
Hi, I'm Sam,
and this is my brother, David.

425
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,634
- So?
- So we wanted to talk to you.

426
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,876
Miss Taylor,
we wanted to talk to you...

427
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,909
...about what happened
at homecoming 35 years ago.

428
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,149
Power to the people.

429
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,423
Right on.

430
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,155
You take your shoes off.

431
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,161
Have a seat, kiddies.
You want some tea?

432
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,304
- No, thank you.
- Penicillin?

433
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,337
Oh, yeah, we would love some...

434
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,133
...tea.

435
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,172
So, what do you kiddies
want to know about that night?

436
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,906
Well, we were hoping
you could tell us everything.

437
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,298
"Professor at Alpine University
kills his own students...

438
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,133
...using urban legends as his m.o."

439
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,948
There were five of them,
including that devil bitch, Dawn.

440
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,048
Gina and I were tricked, drugged and
left 20 miles from home in the woods...

441
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,557
...all because we didn't
worship them like the rest.

442
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:36,724
Everyone said that we
just got wasted and passed out.

443
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,367
No one wanted to cop to the truth.

444
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:43,700
That happened to me too.

445
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,536
I know. I read it in the papers.

446
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,181
But you all came back in one piece.
My best friend...

447
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:52,905
...never came home.

448
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,053
Get that.

449
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,306
- It's Mary.
- What is?

450
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,212
The murders.

451
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:35,050
It's Mary Banner.
Looks like urban legend, but it's Mary.

452
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:39,992
- But she's dead, isn't she?
- Oh, she's dead, all right.

453
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:44,224
But her energy, her life force,
is very strong.

454
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,026
Always was.

455
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,640
You kids know that nothing ever dies,
don't you?

456
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:59,111
It just changes form, you know, like
water into ice into water into steam...

457
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,945
...into water into ice, you dig?

458
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,788
Wait, so you're saying...

459
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,561
...a ghost is killing these kids.

460
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,588
But that doesn't make any sense.
Why would she be killing us?

461
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,859
Why not just go after the people
who actually did this to her?

462
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:24,539
The children will always suffer
the sins of their fathers.

463
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:29,201
Your friend Heather had a devil-bitch
mother by the name of Dawn.

464
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,716
Well, Mary wants revenge on
the five people who took her youth...

465
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,217
...so she's taking their children.

466
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,220
That's where she's starting.
Who knows where she'll stop.

467
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,052
She has always had to have her way.

468
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,160
Come on, you're not buying this,
are you?

469
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,989
Miss Taylor...

470
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:51,232
...we need to know the names
of the boys who did this to you...

471
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,403
...and to Mary.

472
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,140
Oh, baby.

473
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,709
I can barely remember
how to tie my shoes...

474
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,846
...let alone the names of our dates.

475
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,743
But they were all
on the football team.

476
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,052
This is ridiculous.

477
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,225
- I cannot believe you believe her.
- I can't believe you don't.

478
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:28,097
This is as bad as when
you thought there was a vampire...

479
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,934
...living under the porch.
- I'm starting to wonder if I was right.

480
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,909
Kidding.

481
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,444
Heather's mom went to Worthington,
so we can assume she was involved...

482
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,444
...along with Roger's
and Tom's dads.

483
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,117
So we have to figure out
who's next, probably Buck.

484
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,777
Sam, Mary Banner
isn't killing people. She's dead.

485
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,447
It's more likely that Grace Taylor
is doing this.

486
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,958
Look at these.

487
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,234
- Did you steal these?
- Yeah, just look at them.

488
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,807
The handwriting is just like on
the envelope that was sent to Heather.

489
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,978
Grace sent the clippings to Heather.

490
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,084
This is how Heather died.

491
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,790
I saw the spiders,
but no one believed me.

492
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,962
This one's a girl, but the
same thing happened to Roger.

493
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,566
Oh, God.

494
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,998
They're all coming true.

495
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,996
Oh, God. We have to find Buck.

496
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:41,699
He won't be hard to find.
Let's get out of here.

497
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:08,135
- Buck, we need to talk to you.
- What?

498
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,831
You gonna write about me
in the newspaper?

499
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,703
- No, I just think that...
- Come on.

500
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,674
I'm sorry that we played
a stupid fucking joke...

501
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,245
...on you and your friends.

502
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:23,045
But did Roger and Tom
and Heather deserve to die for it?

503
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,447
Do you honestly think
I could kill someone...

504
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,351
...over a stupid, asshole jock prank?

505
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,458
Look, Buck...

506
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,721
...do you know about the kidnappings
at Worthington High in 1969?

507
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,399
That was something that he did
when he was young.

508
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,570
It's like a rite of passage.

509
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,535
- Wait, you're talking about your dad?
- Yeah.

510
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:48,268
My dad was pissed about the picture
you put in the paper. And the article.

511
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,914
He told me about how he
and his friends would have handled it.

512
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,174
So Coach Jacoby was one
of the boys...

513
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,852
...involved in the kidnappings?
The Mary Banner case?

514
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,412
Yeah, but he didn't hurt her.

515
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:01,523
He didn't even know
what happened to her.

516
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,920
She just disappeared.

517
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,920
She didn't die like Heather did.

518
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:11,590
Buck, I'm sorry.

519
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,495
All right, come on,
we gotta get out of here.

520
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,379
Let's go. We gotta get
the heck out of Dodge.

521
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,187
I'm worried about Buck.

522
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,854
Well, he's a source of worry,
I agree.

523
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,428
I think that Buck's dad killed Mary
Banner. I think he's lying to Buck.

524
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,536
Oh, and I'm sure you got this info
directly from Mary Banner.

525
00:51:54,744 --> 00:52:00,705
Well, I saw Coach Jacoby
at her grave after Roger's funeral.

526
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,251
Wait a minute.

527
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,390
You think Coach Jacoby had
something to do with these murders?

528
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:13,427
No, I mean, not directly.
I just think that...

529
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,258
What? You were gonna
say something.

530
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:24,470
This might sound strange,
but I think...

531
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:29,008
She thinks that the ghost
of Mary Banner is killing people.

532
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:37,783
Guys, if either of you have information,
real information...

533
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,456
...you better stop fooling around
and tell me.

534
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:08,115
- <i>Just like that.</i>
- <i>Oh, baby.</i>

535
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,045
<i>You're so nasty.</i>

536
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,988
- <i>Yeah, that's it.</i>
- <i>Spank me.</i>

537
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,685
<i>That's it. Oh, yeah.</i>

538
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:23,397
- <i>So good.</i>
- <i>You love it.</i>

539
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,931
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

540
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,231
- <i>So big.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

541
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:32,430
- <i>Right there. Right there.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

542
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,679
Shit.

543
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,503
Damn it.

544
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,612
Under.

545
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,620
Okay.

546
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,564
What the hell?

547
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,509
Holy shit.

548
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:09,304
Oh, Jesus, Chewy,
did you eat another skunk?

549
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:19,005
- <i>That's right.</i>
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

550
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,683
<i>Don't stop. Don't stop.</i>

551
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,813
<i>Come on. Right there.</i>

552
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,355
<i>You like it, huh?</i>

553
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,050
Hey, don't look now,
but Coach Jacoby's crying.

554
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:52,824
- Maybe something happened to Buck.
- Maybe someone cut his kidneys out.

555
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,055
- Hey.
- Long time no see, Sam.

556
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,665
Have you guys seen Buck?

557
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,565
- Have we seen Buck?
- Yeah, his dad looks really upset.

558
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,569
Yeah, well, Buck got himself
good and killed last night.

559
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,377
Yeah, I heard he got crushed
under a vending machine.

560
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:12,504
He tried to snag some free chips,
and then smash.

561
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,910
Did your mother drink
while she was pregnant?

562
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,313
In the news,
they said he got his throat cut...

563
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,351
...by a prostitute
in some sleazy motel.

564
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,990
Wait. Buck's dead?

565
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,921
Maybe you shouldn't be
so concerned with his well-being.

566
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:27,892
He certainly wasn't concerned
with ours.

567
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,664
Four down. One to go.

568
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,823
Are you still looking for clues?

569
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,526
God, you were fat.

570
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,930
Did you know that Grandpa was bald?

571
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,068
Guess you can kiss
your hairline goodbye.

572
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,465
Yeah, and Grandma has a moustache.

573
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,474
I think Heather was trying
to tell me something.

574
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,806
We know that her mom
was one of the people involved...

575
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,645
...in Mary Banner's disappearance.

576
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:26,446
Why don't we ask Heather's mom
who the other boys were.

577
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:27,953
Yeah, and then what?

578
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,853
And then we'll know who's left
on Mary Banner's hit list.

579
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,827
Sam, I appreciate
your community spirit...

580
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,055
...but most people
in this town don't.

581
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:39,894
- Most people think...
- I'm one bolt short of a nutcase.

582
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,968
That I should have been
drowned at birth.

583
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,765
Yeah, in that general direction.

584
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,477
Where are you going?

585
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,273
We need to talk to the police,
but we need evidence.

586
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,813
I'm going back to see Grace.

587
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:57,009
Oh, that's smart,
walk straight into the jaws of death.

588
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,883
I don't think she's the killer anymore.
She's afraid to leave her house.

589
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,186
But I think she knows
who the killer is.

590
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,494
- Okay, call me.
- Yeah.

591
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,225
Hello?

592
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,209
Grace...

593
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,674
...are you here?

594
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,942
Shit! You scared me to death.

595
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:07,379
What are you doing in my house,
X-Man? How did you get in?

596
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:11,549
- The door was open.
- Oh, yeah.

597
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,087
For the cats.

598
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:15,828
You're lucky.

599
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:19,468
You almost got sprayed
with bug spray. Hit.

600
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,738
What do you want? Spit it out.

601
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,235
I really need you to tell me
the name of the football players...

602
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,710
...who abducted you
all those years ago.

603
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,042
Please, Grace.

604
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:39,479
I wouldn't tell then, I won't tell now.

605
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:50,122
Did anyone ever tell you
that you look exactly like Foxy Brown?

606
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,805
That's smooth, brother.

607
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,008
Very smooth.

608
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:03,942
You know...

609
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,310
...anyone who wanted to could have
found out who those boys were...

610
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,818
...just by looking at the pictures
in the school archive.

611
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:14,022
In the archives?

612
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,925
Right on, Gracie. Thank you.

613
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,302
Damn it.

614
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:37,907
Oh, my God!

615
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,129
Willy. Willy!

616
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,608
Willy!

617
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,539
Don't leave me in here, Willy.

618
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,178
Willy!

619
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,977
Willy!

620
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,426
There's Grace.

621
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,164
Where's Mary?

622
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,430
Hello, Mary.

623
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,272
Who's your date?

624
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,575
There he is.

625
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,228
Holy shit.

626
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:21,235
No. No, stop.

627
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,635
Leave me alone. No.

628
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,837
Leave me alone!

629
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,816
Grace.

630
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,342
Grace, you need to get a phone
that works.

631
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,226
Grace, please.

632
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,953
Please.

633
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,228
What does Mary want with me?

634
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,662
Mary's visited you too, huh?

635
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,384
Find her.

636
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,987
Find her and bury her.

637
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,315
But I saw her grave.

638
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:14,720
You saw a tombstone, baby girl.
She's not buried there.

639
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,558
Gina and I looked for her
for years.

640
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,530
Nobody ever found her body.

641
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,498
She could be anywhere.

642
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:31,880
I think I know where she is.

643
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,787
I hope this is what you want.

644
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:58,703
Sam!

645
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,108
Samantha!

646
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,495
<i>Hey, it's the Owens.
Leave a message.</i>

647
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,757
<i>David, are you there?</i>

648
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,662
<i>David, if you're there,
pick up the phone.</i>

649
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,067
<i>David.</i>

650
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,001
I think I know where the body is.

651
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,612
<i>I know... I kno</i>w <i>you think
I'm crazy, but...</i>

652
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:16,945
This is the one piece of evidence
that we need to bring it to the cops.

653
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:22,014
When you get this message,
meet me at the school, okay?

654
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,023
<i>You have my keys.</i>

655
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,288
<i>Meet me at the side door.</i>

656
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,032
I forgot to tell you.

657
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,772
Your brother went over
to the school.

658
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:48,346
Great. He has my keys.

659
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:52,048
You're just gonna have
to take me in your car.

660
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,948
No way.

661
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,627
I have not been back there
since homecoming, 1969.

662
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,626
Please. I would take my bike,
but it'll take me too long.

663
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,924
No, I can't!

664
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,730
Look at me.

665
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,375
Grace.

666
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,245
Damn.

667
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:35,953
You have to promise me that you
will bury her when you find her.

668
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,976
David!

669
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:58,617
David, open the door!

670
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,515
- David!
- Shit.

671
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,523
David, open the door!

672
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,623
David?

673
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,769
I saw someone in there.

674
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,903
- Was it Mary?
- I don't know.

675
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,370
Maybe.

676
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,451
I'm gonna climb through the window.

677
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,088
I'll go around and open
the door for you.

678
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,269
No, hey, I'm cool.
I'll wait in the van.

679
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,902
Oh, damn.

680
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:50,768
Shit.

681
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,406
Grace, I got her.

682
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,569
Grace, wake up.

683
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:58,105
Shit. I found her, Grace.

684
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,650
Grace, I really need your help.

685
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,722
Grace. Shit.

686
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,854
Damn, that's some chronic. Shit.

687
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,660
Grace.

688
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,588
Oh, no.

689
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,598
Oh, Grace.

690
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,626
Are you okay?

691
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,099
Oh, shit.

692
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,005
Grace.

693
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,602
Oh, no.

694
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:29,908
Oh, my God.

695
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:40,950
Oh, fuck.

696
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,172
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Bill.

697
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:01,171
- Bill, thank God.
- <i>Sam, where are you?</i>

698
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:04,539
- I'm at the cemetery.
- <i>Calm down... Sweetie.</i>

699
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:08,006
- <i>Your mother... Sam, what's going on?</i>
- What?

700
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:11,951
<i>I can't hear you. You're in a what?</i>

701
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:15,215
- I can't hear you.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

702
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,288
I'm at the cemetery.

703
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,427
Fuck. Fucking cell phones.

704
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,195
Bill.

705
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,629
Thank God you're here.
I really need your help.

706
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,806
All right, just calm down
and tell me what's going on.

707
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,134
I found the body.
Now I have to bury it.

708
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,401
Mary Banner's body.

709
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:48,241
I finally found it, and now
she wants me to bury the corpse.

710
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,794
Here, sweetheart, I got it.

711
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,525
This ground's frozen.

712
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,665
Okay, I just don't want you
to worry about this.

713
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:14,966
I'll take care of it.

714
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:17,743
Everything will be fine.

715
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,748
Did you hear that?

716
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,557
That might be Coach Jacoby.

717
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:40,190
Don't worry about him.
I can take care of him.

718
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,306
Does anybody else
know about this body?

719
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,065
No, just me and David.

720
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:01,889
Did you say anything
to your mom?

721
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,393
Samantha.

722
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,724
Someone, help!

723
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,001
Someone, help me!

724
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:22,903
- Did you tell your mom?
- No.

725
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,106
- Help!
- You leave her alone!

726
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,340
Get out of here, baby! Go on!

727
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,915
Willy Owens.

728
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,622
You're gonna go down.

729
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:40,027
You wait until the city council
hears about this.

730
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,133
Samantha!

731
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:24,465
Come on, sweetheart, I don't want
to hurt you. I just wanna talk.

732
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,869
Samantha!

733
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,542
I'm sorry I hit you.

734
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:42,246
L... I have a problem with anger
management, but I'm okay now.

735
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:28,969
What's gonna happen
to your mother if I go to jail?

736
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,037
Because she won't have
David anymore...

737
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:34,036
...because David is dead.

738
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,543
You're crazy!

739
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:03,853
What the...?

740
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:30,450
Grace.

741
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:35,924
I...

742
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,012
Far out.

743
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,757
No one is ever gonna believe us.

744
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:17,958
Samantha.

745
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:36,014
Follow the tracks down the hill.

746
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,487
Hey, now.

747
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:45,987
- I fall asleep again?
- Yep.

748
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:52,764
Bill.

749
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:55,060
You mean "punk."

750
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:58,299
They're saying he died
of a heart attack.

751
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:03,033
I guess something must have
scared his butt real bad.

752
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:10,514
You gonna be okay?

753
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:17,520
I guess this will just be
another ghost story.

754
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:22,930
Something to talk about around
campfires and slumber parties.

755
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,395
Baby girl,
you're the urban legend now.

756
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:35,832
A decades-old mystery
was finally solved last night...

757
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:39,342
...when police discovered the body
of mayoral candidate Bill Owens...

758
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:42,174
...dead of a heart attack
while apparently attempting...

759
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:44,578
...to dispose of the remains
of Mary Banner...

760
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,118
...a local girl who disappeared
over 30 years ago.

761
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,950
While police refuse to confirm it,
a source tells us...

762
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,626
...that it was Owens
who was actually responsible...

763
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:57,924
...for Banner's death on that
fateful homecoming night in 1969.
