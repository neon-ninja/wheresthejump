1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,700
<i>We still meet sometimes...</i>

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,220
<i>Bea, Meja and me.</i>

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,500
<i>But we never talk about it.</i>

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,740
<i>It's a solemn promise.</i>

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,380
<i>As by not speaking of it,
it has never happened.</i>

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,020
<i>But deep down, of course, we know.</i>

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,100
Elvira, hurry up now.
We're leaving soon.

8
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,540
Are there pillows there
or should I bring my own?

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,860
They are there.

10
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,340
But what if it gets cold?
I have no wam clothes.

11
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,340
There are blankets as well.
You won't freeze.

12
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,100
I should bring some food.
What if I get hungry?

13
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,620
Stop worrying. It will be fun!

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,420
What if we're not allowed to share a room?
- Would that be the end of the world?

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,940
Yes. In that case, you must talk to them.

16
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,860
We're leaving now..
- Sibel is ill. She can't come.

17
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,500
But you'll have a great time,
even on your own.

18
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,260
- Hi.
- It's time, come on.

19
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,100
Sibel is ill, so we can't go.

20
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,580
I hope we never get there.

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,740
You'll find new friends there.

22
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,660
Hitta mig...

23
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,140
Hitta mig...

24
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,100
- Did you bring grandma's ring?
- It's actually not grandma's anymore.

25
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,380
Don't get rid of it. Promise me.

26
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,740
- Oh my god!
- What was that?

27
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,100
I don't know.

28
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,500
Are you coming?

29
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,420
My tummy hurts.
I want to go home.

30
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Elvira, you're 12 years old.
You're too old for this.

31
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,820
It's only a week.
It will be over before you know it.

32
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
Come.

33
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,540
Here we are.

34
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,820
Hello, sorry we're late.
- Hi. You must be Elvira.

35
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,260
Hello. I'm Jennifer.

36
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,220
You're the last one. You can come here.

37
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,620
Have fun now.

38
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,500
You'll be roommates with... Bea.

39
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,220
No, I'm Meja.
- Then you must be Bea.

40
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,700
Come.

41
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,980
- Bye.
- Bye.

42
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,900
How old are you?
- I'm going to start at six.

43
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,580
- Me too.
- And me.

44
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,860
- Is this your first time?
- Yes.

45
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,900
So... let's see.

46
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,820
You'll be staying... here.

47
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,500
In room 217.

48
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,820
So...

49
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:51,220
Okay, there's blankets.
We'll get some pillows later.

50
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,460
Other than that, just pick one.

51
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,380
Damn crap.

52
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,540
Oh, shit!

53
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,620
Björn!

54
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,220
What happened?
- I just turned on the tap!

55
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,220
We'll need to let this room dry.
No one can stay here.

56
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Isn't there any other room available?

57
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,660
Thay can take room 213.

58
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,380
But that's not in use.

59
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,460
The key is downstairs.

60
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,380
Room 13. That's scary.
- But it's 213.

61
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,700
- It's still a 13.
- Shocking.

62
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,820
Then why do all those bad things
happen on the 13th.

63
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,940
- Do they?
- I read it somewhere.

64
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,340
And my grandmother slipped in the shower
and broke her leg on Friday the 13th.

65
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,620
Oh, stop it.

66
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,260
I found it!

67
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,300
Let's see.

68
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,980
It seems to be stuck.

69
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,060
I'll get something to
clean this place up with.

70
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,900
Check.

71
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,060
Come back down when you're done.

72
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,140
Björkudden!

73
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,460
Okay. If you have any questions,
just ask me or Björn.

74
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,060
Otherwise, I'll see you at lunch.
- No, wait...

75
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,580
Before you go, turn on your phones.
- Check out those guys.

76
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,860
You can have your phones on days 2,
4 and 6, half an hour after dinner.

77
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,380
If at any other time you need a phone,
just use the public one.

78
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,060
I don't have one with me.

79
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,540
Okay, have fun!

80
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,900
Who do you think's the cutest?

81
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,700
Isak I think. Or Arvid.

82
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,140
So who will it be?

83
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,940
I can't choose.
They're both really cute.

84
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,180
I like Kevin. I like his style.

85
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,780
Okay, now smile. Do your thing.

86
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,220
What about you, Elvira?
Who do you think is the cutest?

87
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,380
Melker! No doubt about it.

88
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,420
I don't know.

89
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,220
But!

90
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,580
Tighten up. Only two sausages each!

91
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,100
Damn. I should have met Meja.

92
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,140
Here. Have mine if you want.
- Thanks..

93
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,020
- Can I take your picture?
- Okay.

94
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,620
- Say "cheese".
- Cheese.

95
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,500
It's not right again.
A little closer.

96
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,420
I didn't bring my camera.
It's broken..

97
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,620
There must be something wrong with the flash.
- Or it's me.

98
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,460
Meja, you look like a ghost.

99
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,340
Need help with those?
- No, the ghost is helping me..

100
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,860
Stop!

101
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,540
- What is it?
- I feel dizzy.

102
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,380
- Afraid of heights?
- No...

103
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,620
But I'll take the bottom bed
just in case.

104
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,380
Stop it! Stop!

105
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,260
Stop!

106
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,900
That's a nice ring you have.
- Thanks.

107
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,700
My grandmother gave it to me.
She's had it since she was mny age.

108
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,940
- Good night then.
- Good night.

109
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,580
My ring! I'm sure I put
it on the nightstand!

110
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,300
It didn't just fall onto the floor?

111
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,740
Someone must have taken it.

112
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,780
Who would do that?

113
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,780
No one's been here.
Or are you saying it was one of us?

114
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,340
I didn't say that.

115
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm going to brush my teeth.

116
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,060
Kevin!
- He's in trouble for this!

117
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,540
- Can't you reach?
- Help me then.

118
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,900
What the hell! Stop!

119
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,900
Stop!

120
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,620
Kevin wet himself.

121
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,020
Cell phone time.

122
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,900
Yes, we had a lot of fun.
We had a water fight today.

123
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,340
Look at her cell phone.
I want one of those.

124
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,820
No, we're not doing anything crazy.
No, no one's sad.

125
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,580
Thought I did something bad today.

126
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,620
But that's a secret.
I hope she doesn't get too angry.

127
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,500
I know Meja took my ring.

128
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,300
I'll get her back for that.

129
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,540
<i>I know you took Elvira's ring.</i>

130
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,060
<i>Return it immediately
or I will take something of yours.</i>

131
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,180
<i>The ghost of room 213.</i>

132
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,420
So he took the spare can and went
for the gas station miles away.

133
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,540
The girlfriend was left alone in the car
listening to the radio.

134
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,220
After a while something knocked
on the roof, so she got out...

135
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,620
to see what it was.
And then she saw...

136
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,940
Revenge is sweet.
- Stop it, Kevin.

137
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,980
Calm down. That's enough for one night.

138
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,340
Thank you Arvid, for the
last story of the night.

139
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,500
- There's one more thing.
- Okay.

140
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,340
Henny can finish for tonight.

141
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,580
I just wanted to say my mother
has also been here at Björkudden once.

142
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,580
Long ago, when she was our age.

143
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,820
And every night, she woke up
because the door handle moved...

144
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,540
and the door slowly opened.

145
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,340
But when she went to look,
there was no one in the hallway.

146
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,980
One night she heard foorsteps
and she followed them.

147
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,940
She came to a large mirror.

148
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,140
But instead of seeing her own reflection...

149
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,940
a girl in a white dress
stood stare and stared at her.

150
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,380
Okay, that's enough for now.
- Henny, don't be intimidating like that.

151
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,860
We all know there's no such
thing as ghosts. Right, Henny?

152
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,020
That was scary, what Henny said.
About that girl.

153
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,900
Maybe Henny's ghost took your ring, Elvira.

154
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,900
That would seem to be a
very mischievous ghost.

155
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,660
Stop, it's not funny!
- There might be a ghost living in this room.

156
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,660
The ghost in room 213.

157
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,380
Meja, I'm scared.

158
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,620
I think I know what this ghost looks like.
- You do?

159
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,620
- Like a sheet.
- What?

160
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,140
I think I know her name as well.
- Whose name? The ghost?

161
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,340
Yes. What's its name then?
- It starts with an M.

162
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,300
- And then?
- An E.

163
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,620
Me?

164
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,620
Mebel...

165
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,260
Is that a name?

166
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,340
I don't know where it came from.

167
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Goodnight then, ghost Mebel.

168
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,580
Bea, what is it?
- There was someone at the door.

169
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,260
Who?

170
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,020
You were dreaming. There's no one there.
- Someone was there!

171
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,140
What are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.

172
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,620
Have any of you seen my camera?
- No. Why?

173
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,260
I'm sure I put it on the night stand.

174
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,740
It's my brother's.
He'll kill me if I lose it.

175
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,580
Aren't you coming with us?
- We're going over there.

176
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,740
They'll run into us.
Hurry up, Elvira! Paddle!

177
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,020
Damn it, Kevin!

178
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,540
- Have you seen my cyclops?
- No.

179
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,260
Can you find it?
- No, it's gone.

180
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,540
Bea! Bea!
You nasty piece of work.

181
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,540
Isn't this yours?

182
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,580
Bea, is that not Elvira's cyclops?
- I'm just borrowing it.

183
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,580
I wonder what else she's 'borrowed'.

184
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,260
Shit, it's Bea. of course.
- What?

185
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,500
The one who took my camera.
And your ring.

186
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,700
Didn't you see how she looked at it?
- It was you who...

187
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,780
I don't want it to be her.
I really like Bea.

188
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,980
Don't you remember she didn't
bring a cell phone

189
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,500
I don't think she even has one.
Or a camera.

190
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,500
She said it was broken.
Definitely a lie.

191
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,060
Besides, she's the only one
who hasn't lost anything.

192
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,660
What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

193
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,580
You're talking about Melker aren't you?
- Right.

194
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,020
He checks on everyone
all the time.

195
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,740
Can I go with you tonight?
- Yes.

196
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,260
It could be just the two of us.
- They actually said that?

197
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,100
Okay, then it's fine by me.

198
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,380
There's 12 questions. They're all
multiplce choice. And you play in pairs.

199
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,260
Where's Bea?
- She's in her room, she's not feeling well.

200
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,900
How typical. Pretending to be sick
so she can take more stuff.

201
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,780
Watch where you put your feet.
It's completely dark in the forest,

202
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,620
What are you afraid of?
- How about you?

203
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,460
But you're girls. Girls are more
scared than boys, everyone knows that.

204
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,540
I promise. It's a scientific fact.
- We will see.

205
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,900
Are you ready? I can't hear you!
Are you ready? Okay, good luck!

206
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,060
'Scientific fact'.
He should watch himself.

207
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,180
Yeah, it's a lie.
Henny's scared of ghosts.

208
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,020
That's the question, isn't it.

209
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,620
<i>What year was Björkudden opened?
1930, 1940 or 1950?</i>

210
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,700
- Not a clue.
- We'll put down X.

211
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,540
<i>What's the owl's name?
Cat Owl, Spectacled Owl or Ghost Owl?</i>

212
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,900
Ghost Owl.

213
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,780
What was that?

214
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,660
Probably nothing.

215
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,860
But... we have to go see.

216
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,940
There's no question here.

217
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,820
We're going in.
- No, I want to go back.

218
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,620
Come on.

219
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,500
There's nothing here, we're leaving.
- But 'was just going to...

220
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,220
Are you crazy?
You nearly scared us to death!

221
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,420
- Who are you going with?
- Ingen.

222
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,740
Or, I'll just go by myself.
- What? You can't do that!

223
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,100
You shouldn't be here.

224
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,300
No, there's nothing here.
Come on.

225
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,100
Can I have the flashlight?
- I dropped it.

226
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,020
Go get it then.

227
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,820
Hello there!

228
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,820
Huh?

229
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,420
What was that you said?
That thing about "scientific fact"?

230
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,020
I was really scared.
I thought there was a maniac in there.

231
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,180
So not a ghost then?
- No. There's no such thing as ghosts.

232
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,660
You! I'm glad you think I'm cute.
You're also...

233
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,740
What? I never said that!

234
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,180
But you wrote it in your text.

235
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,420
I didn't send any texts

236
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,100
Hmm. Might be mistaken then.

237
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,220
I'll get you back for scaring us.
- We were really scared.

238
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,780
I'll scare the shit out of you.
- I'm not afraid of anything.

239
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,540
What about the thing Henny's mother saw?
The girls who sneaks around at night.

240
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,820
Let's just hope it's not
a ghost who wants to hurt us.

241
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,420
Stop it.

242
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,700
Why are all ghosts girls?
Why always in white dresses and long hair?

243
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,900
What? A ghost can just as well be a guy
in a white sheet and a wig.

244
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:27,300
Name a guy ghost then.
- Dracula, Freddy krueger, there's lots of them.

245
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,860
There's no girl ghosts.
- Samar in <i>The Ring</i>, Kayako in <i>The Grudge</i>.

246
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,180
Do you like those kinds of movies?
No wonder you can't sleep at night.

247
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,100
As long as you know
that it's not real.

248
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,940
It was bedtime 10 minutes ago.

249
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,420
To bed with you. Let's go!

250
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:02,980
Did you hear what he said?
"Melker's skin". As if...

251
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,420
How silly.

252
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,860
But then... he's so cute.
_ That's true.

253
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,980
Kevin then?

254
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,540
By the way, melker said
that I had texted him.

255
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,580
That's interesting.
What did you say?

256
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,940
That... that he was cute.

257
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,900
Oooh. Love is in the air!

258
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,540
Stop it.

259
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,020
Can you hand me my bracelets?

260
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Thanks.

261
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,260
- What is it?
- I saw a girl!

262
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Bea, you just dreamed again.

263
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:48,700
It wasn't a dream. I saw her!
- But there's no such thing as ghosts.

264
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,820
What did she look like then?
- Like you.

265
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,620
Like me? Maybe it was me.

266
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,060
What are you talking about?
_ Mom says I walk in my sleep sometimes

267
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,020
No, can't be. She was a redhead.

268
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,380
Maybe you found a wig in your sleep.

269
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
Here we go.

270
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,220
Has anyone seen my pen?

271
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Has anyone seen my pen?
- We're actually singing.

272
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,620
Maybe we should help her?
- But... she took it herself.

273
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,660
She was very sad.
- Ever hear of 'crocodile tears'?

274
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,860
How can someone just take
someone else's stuff.

275
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,300
I get it when someone takes Elvira's ring or
my camera. They're actually worth something.

276
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,380
But what about your pen. 20 öre?

277
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,740
Something can be valuable
even if it doesn't cost a lot of money.

278
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,980
My aunt gave it to me a week
before she died, it means...

279
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,060
Arvid and Sara?

280
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,140
Maybe he didn't know you like him?

281
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,140
I'm not feeling well. I'm going to my room.
- I'm coming with you.

282
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,980
I want to be alone for awhile.

283
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,180
Cell phone time!
- Are you coming?

284
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,420
What are you doing?

285
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,220
Getting rid of some of the
unwanted things in my life.

286
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,900
There you go.

287
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,820
By the way, I think Isaac is the sweetest.
I thought so all along.

288
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,540
Where is my camera?
- Your camera?

289
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,020
<i>I know you took Elvira's ring. Return it
immediately or I will take something of yours.</i>

290
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,740
<i>The ghost of room 213.</i>
- That was just for fun!

291
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,460
A blast. Now get me my camera.
- I didn't take it.

292
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,940
I sent that text because
I thought you'd taken my ring.

293
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,860
Why should I take your ring?
- I thought you did it as a prank.

294
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,940
But that was just
to get along with Melker.

295
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,180
I texted him that he was cute
and write that it was from you.

296
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,940
How could you think
that I'd taken your ring.

297
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,860
What? You thought it was Bea.
- What? You thought I did it?

298
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,060
But... like... it's because...

299
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,100
You don't have your own stuff.
Cell phone, camera, and so on.

300
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,100
And then you're alone
in your room all the time.

301
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,900
That's because you make me feel left out.

302
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,500
That's not true!
- Is it, Elvira?

303
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,700
What? You think I'm being mean to Elvira?
In that case, you're just as mean.

304
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,140
Can we just stop with the accusations?
I didn't take anything...

305
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,820
and I don't think it was
any of you guys either.

306
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
Okay.

307
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,620
What is this?

308
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,300
Elvira, look.

309
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,380
So things went missing at night?
- Apparantly. Something different every night.

310
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,620
And you're absolutely sure
that they're gone?

311
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,540
We've searched everywhere.

312
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
What do you want me to do anout it?

313
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,900
- Quiet!
- Okay.

314
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,900
We have some obvious rules here.

315
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,540
No swimming by yourself.
Don't leave the camp without staff.

316
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,940
No drygs. No smoking.

317
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,860
And don't steal from the others.

318
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,860
Break the rules,
and we will send you home.

319
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,780
It could be a prank. or a ghost.
- Not a very funny prank.

320
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,300
If anyone knows anything,
now's the time to speak up.

321
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,180
Maybe it's a real thief.
Someone from the outside.

322
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,020
- What's happening.
- Look.

323
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,220
The ghost.

324
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,900
No, it's not a ghost.
There's problems with the generator.

325
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,380
If it was someone from the outside,
we would have known about it.

326
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,540
And the doors are locked at night.

327
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,660
So you mean it's someone from here?
One of us?

328
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,260
I'll count to 50 and then I'll come.
If you don't hide well I'll find you.

329
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,900
50, 49, 48...

330
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,860
Close your eyes!

331
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,980
3, 2, 1, 0. Here I come!

332
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,900
What are you doing here?
- Hiding.

333
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,820
Look over there.

334
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:25,260
Eva is my mother.
She stayed in room 213 when she was here.

335
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,620
This is the most haunted part.

336
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,620
Have you had a cut?
- I'm here. Where are you?

337
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,980
Anyone here?
Maybe under the bed?

338
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,740
- It's just me.
- Are you playing?

339
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,980
- No.
- Can we just say you are?

340
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,100
So at least I found someone.
- Okay.

341
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,860
Mebel and Hjördis...?

342
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,140
Does she really exist?

343
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,300
Bea, Meja.
- You can hide here if you want.

344
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,180
You...

345
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,940
It was meja who sent that text,

346
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,500
Yeah, - So...

347
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,140
Found you!
- Look, Meja. Melker and Elvira are kissing.

348
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,340
- Stop!
- So are you a thing now?

349
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,060
We were just hiding.
- Yeah right.

350
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,220
There's so many mosquitos here
but they didn't get me once.

351
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,460
Me neither,

352
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,060
Do you know why they bite you?
- No?

353
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,500
Me neither. But I feel like
they should like me.

354
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,900
- What was that?
- What?

355
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,780
Is anyone here?

356
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,940
Gitls are so easy to scare.
- You idiot!

357
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,420
What? You think it's a ghost taking stuff?
- We don't think that at all.

358
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,100
Yes you do. look how scared you are.
- Stop it!

359
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,620
It's quite clear that it's Kevin.
Right?

360
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,780
He's teasing because he's on love with Meja.
- Oh stop it.

361
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,820
But yes... that must be it.

362
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,220
Charlie, Charlie...
are you in the room?

363
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,620
We're you doing that?
- I didn't do anything.

364
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,660
Shh... he's coming.

365
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,180
We know you're here, Kevin.

366
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,940
What if it's not Kevin but the ghost?
- Stop it, Bea.

367
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,060
Bea!

368
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,500
I'm just kidding,
- I got really scared.

369
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,460
Shit, this sucks.

370
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,180
Shhh... that's him!

371
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
Come on.

372
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,660
I see him.

373
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,620
Kevin...

374
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,700
Come find me...

375
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,660
Come find me...

376
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,860
Elvira...

377
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,100
Elvira?

378
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,860
Why didn't you wake us?
- I just woke up.

379
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,620
When did you change then?

380
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,820
I don't know.

381
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,020
What's that?

382
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,140
It seems to be a letter.

383
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,740
And it's written with my pen.
- A purple pen?

384
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,220
What does it say?

385
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,260
<i>Ask the woman in the red house.</i>

386
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,420
Ask what? And what red house?

387
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,300
It looks like...
Look, it's a page from my diary.

388
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,700
<i>Asl the woman in the red house.</i>
What does that mean?

389
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,180
- There's no red house here.
- No.

390
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,500
How, Elvira? _ What?

391
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,500
There are no red houses here.

392
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,340
I've seen a red house.
Although it's outside the camp.

393
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,220
Does a woman live there?
_ I don't know.

394
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,140
We drove past it on the way here.
It looked deserted.

395
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,100
What are you waiting for then?
Come on!

396
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,420
I need to talk to you.
- Leave me alone.

397
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,140
Are you going somewhere?

398
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,940
Nowhere. Just going for a walk.

399
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:26,020
Yes, but... were you building a raft?
- I was.

400
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,540
Yes, yes. Don't leave the camp alone.
- I won't.

401
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,620
Isn't it illegal to go here?

402
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,460
There's certainly no one here.
It looks completely deserted.

403
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,980
I think we should go back.

404
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,900
- What are you doing?
- Hello!

405
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,260
- Hello.
- Sorry, we were just...

406
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,220
We were wondering if anyone lived here.
- Someone does. What do you want?

407
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,340
Can my friend use your bathroom?

408
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,380
Sure. It's right through there.
The door is open.

409
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,900
But I don't need to use the bathroom.
- We're looking for something suspicious.

410
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,580
What's your name?
- My name is Hjördis.

411
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,340
- You're from Björkudden?
- Yes.

412
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,100
Are you allowed off the camp site like this?
- Yes. Or... well, no.

413
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,740
No. In my time they were
very strict about those rules.

414
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,620
<i>Hjördis and Mebel.</i>

415
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,980
<i>Björkudden, 1961.</i>

416
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,460
Where did your friend go?

417
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,620
No problem. She's not feeling so well.

418
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,940
Yes. I should probably go and look.

419
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,260
No, it's alright.

420
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,460
Elvira, hurry up!
Elvira, we have to go now!

421
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,940
What are you doing up there?
- I'm sorry.

422
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,580
- What's that?
- Hurry up!

423
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,100
Run!

424
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,340
So there really is a Mebel?
- Yes, it said so on the card,

425
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,700
<i>Mebel and Hjördis, 1961.</i>

426
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,900
She was a redhead.
- Just like the girl I saw at night!

427
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,100
There was an abituary as well.
She's dead.

428
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,260
Where have you been?
Has the raft been completed?

429
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,620
We were just out.
- Out? Out where?

430
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,300
What is it?

431
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,580
Did something happen?

432
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,420
Yes. or no.

433
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,580
It's haunting our room.
- Haunting?

434
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,060
She's a redhead. The ghost.

435
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,180
The ghost is a redhead?
- And her name is Mebel.

436
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,340
How do you know that?
Did she introduce herself to you?

437
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,980
No, but Elvira said so.
- But I'm not sure where she heard that.

438
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,500
There's no such thing as ghosts.

439
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,780
You're 12 years old, you know that,

440
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,780
There they are, the smugglers.
- We built it ourselves. Where did you go?

441
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,900
Nowhere.
- We noticed. We were looking everywhere.

442
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,700
What are you doing, really?
- Nothing.

443
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,940
So you were doing nothing nowere?
- Right.

444
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,620
Come on, Isaac.
We'll name the raft.

445
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,580
What idiots.

446
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,540
What do you think?
- So it was you after all?

447
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,900
You're full of shit. I knew it!
- What? What have we done?

448
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,620
The missing stuff!
The door! The letter!

449
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,860
But how do you get Hjördis to do it?
Do you know her?

450
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,940
- Which Hjördis?
- Which letter?

451
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:44,260
Why else would you name the raft <i>Mebel</i>?

452
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,260
Come on.

453
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,260
Meja, come!

454
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,060
Calm down now.

455
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,060
Be nice to each other now.

456
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,580
Hörni, what did I say?

457
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,780
It's you.

458
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,540
Hah!

459
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:43,020
Jennifer... is it true a girl
died here at camp?

460
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,260
So it was you. I always thought so.
- What?

461
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,380
Hjördis came around and told me
some girls had come by her house.

462
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,620
No... or...

463
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,220
You know you can't leave camp grounds.

464
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,300
Are you going to send me home?

465
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:14,580
Here's what we do.
Don't tell anyone, but...

466
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,420
I'll pretend that I
don't know what you did.

467
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,020
Okay? But don't break the rules again.
I will have to send you home then.

468
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,140
When I was here,
I was also in love with a boy.

469
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,340
But I didn't dare say anything either.

470
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,100
Then camp was over and I went home.

471
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:59,500
Are you alright?
- A little to the left.

472
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,340
A little higher.

473
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,060
Down a bit now.
- Just a little more.

474
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,820
Get off now.
- But we're almost there.

475
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,420
We can't stand it.

476
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,820
You know what, forget about it.

477
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,980
Can you imagine anyone
picking it up, Elvira?

478
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,060
- It's in the office.
- Okay.

479
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,540
What are you afraid of?
- I just want to show you something.

480
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,940
- What?
- It's a secret.

481
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,300
Did you take them?
- No. I can show you if you promise...

482
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,340
not to tell anyone.
Not even Meja and Bea.

483
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,180
I promise.

484
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,420
Henny, how did you know
about the cuts?

485
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,700
My mom told me.

486
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,500
Close the door behind you
and stay quiet.

487
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:44,060
Here they are, sit down.

488
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,940
But they're kittens.
- Aren't they cute?

489
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,780
I hid them here so
no one would find them.

490
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,060
No one else knows?
- No. I'm afraid that if someone finds them...

491
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,020
they might get killed.

492
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:15,980
You should talk to Jennifer.
She's nice. She can help you.

493
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,140
Where did you go?
- Picking up this.

494
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:28,460
In the shed?
- No, I was just going to look.

495
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,380
Oh, come on.

496
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,380
Which do you think I should take?
- This one. It would fit...

497
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,700
- This?
- No, that one.

498
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,340
This one would look great.

499
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,620
Doesn't this feel too pink?
- Or take it here.

500
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,580
I think it actually gets better.

501
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,900
You can borrow my eye shadow.
It will match your eyes.

502
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,580
Thanks.

503
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,420
Don't they look too green now?

504
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,540
No, it must be the light.
You look great.

505
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:17,940
I just wanted to tell you about Mebel.
We didn't understand why you got so angry.

506
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,340
We didn't mean anything by it.
- Why did you do it then?

507
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,500
It's because...
We thought our raft was so great...

508
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,660
so we wanted to name it
for the prettiest girl in camp.

509
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,420
Then we all thought of someone else.

510
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,820
So we took the first latters of all
the names and we made a new name.

511
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,780
That's all.

512
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,860
Meja, Bea, Elvira.

513
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,900
Mebel.

514
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,020
How stupid of us.

515
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:46,420
- Shall we dance?
- Yes.

516
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,700
- What is it?
- Nothing.

517
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,060
Shall we go outside?

518
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,980
Did I look different in the mirror?

519
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,380
Huh? No.

520
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,060
You...

521
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,540
I was thinking of something.

522
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,940
I like you.

523
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,060
Elvira?

524
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:28,020
What is it? What are you doing?
- Look... she's sitting on Elvira's bed.

525
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,980
Who is that?

526
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:36,180
It's Elvira.
- But look at the hair. Don't you see it?

527
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:43,860
Do you see now that it's just Elvira?

528
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,380
What are you doing?

529
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:51,220
Are you writing in your diary...
in the dark?

530
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,620
- I don't know.
- What? You do.

531
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,540
You have a pen in your hand.

532
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,820
Isn't that Bea's pen by the way?

533
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,700
So it was you?

534
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,380
<i>The ring and camera are in
a cigar box in the shed.</i>

535
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:19,740
<i>Thanks for letting me borrow them. Mebel</i>
- I didn't write that.

536
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:25,500
If you think this is funny
then you're crazy.

537
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,780
I must have done it in my sleep.

538
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:34,500
Did you go to the shed in youre sleep too?
I saw you picking up the cord.

539
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:39,060
That was completely different.
- Yeah? And what was that?

540
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,580
I can't tell you.
- No, you'd betray yourself then.

541
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:58,300
It was Henny. She found some kittens
and she showed them to me.

542
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,500
Kittens?
- Yes. In a basket in the shed.

543
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:07,060
Then let's go there and see. For your
sake those kittens had better be there.

544
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,620
You go first.

545
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,980
So where are these kittens?

546
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,860
- They were here.
- Sure.

547
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,580
I swear...

548
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:16,700
Where is my camera?
- There's a box.

549
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,180
Thief.

550
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,780
Wait, don't go!

551
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,940
Wait!

552
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:54,420
Let me in.
- You can call Björn or Jennifer.

553
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:59,060
But then they would know it's you
running around at night, stealing stuff.

554
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,940
Or...

555
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,060
you can take my camera.

556
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,460
Come on.

557
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,340
Look, she's awake.
- I solved the mystery.

558
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:58,780
What mystery?
About the ghost and who took our stuff.

559
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,260
That was you.

560
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,580
Last chance to tell the truth.
- It wasn't me.

561
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,900
As you wish,.

562
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,180
- Here's the camera.
- Alright.

563
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,780
Schyst.
- What';s the matter. What happened?

564
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:43,060
Have you seen a ghost again?
- There's no ghosts, there's a thief.

565
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:46,420
There must be a ghost.
I can prove it.

566
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,540
You've been lying all along.
- I never lied to anyone.

567
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,820
You're accusing everyone all the time.

568
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:01,060
I did as you said.
I told Jennifer about the kittens...

569
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:05,460
and she found a shelter where they
won't be killed. All except one.

570
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:09,580
- I can keep it.
- How sweet.

571
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,500
I told you so.

572
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:22,700
Can I tell you about the ghost now?
Or maybe I should just show you...

573
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:26,220
Shit, you went there
on your own last night?

574
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,860
These are journals from
a hundred years ago.

575
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:40,860
This is from 1962.

576
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:45,980
<i>The girls in room 213
report strange noises at night.</i>

577
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:49,500
<i>Wristwatch gone. The ceiling light came on
in the middle of the night.</i>

578
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,540
And check this out.

579
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:04,060
<i>Björkudden, 1985.</i>

580
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,900
<i>Eva woke up with
inexplicable cuts on her legs.</i>

581
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:11,740
Do you remember Henny told me
her mother saw a ghost at camp?

582
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,780
Eva is her mother.

583
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,460
<i>Eva and Gunnel see a red-haired girl
in the hallway in the middle of the night.</i>

584
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,900
What's that?

585
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:29,500
<i>Tragic death at Björkudden. Yesterday,
12-year-old Mebel Andersson was found dead...</i>

586
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,980
<i>at Björkudden's children's camp.
The cause of death is still unknown...</i>

587
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:39,300
<i>but all signs indicate it was an accident.</i>

588
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,940
I'm sorry.

589
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,260
I think it was a ghost.

590
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:52,820
But stop it. It's all just a coincedence.

591
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,900
What about the other stuff?
The door that was opened? The letter?

592
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:03,020
And the strange picture of Elvira?
And the letters that wrote themselves?

593
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,820
Was that also a coincedence?
Check this. The picture looks normal now.

594
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,980
You must send those of Melker to me.

595
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,740
Of course.

596
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:18,140
What's that?
I didn't record any video.

597
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,660
Has anyone recorded with your camera?

598
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,540
It's me!

599
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,940
<i>Thank you for staying in room 213.</i>

600
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,180
<i>It's been empty for so many years now.</i>

601
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:00,380
<i>When you came here
it was like I was alive again.</i>

602
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:04,300
<i>Thank you for giving me
my best week ever,</i>

603
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,660
<i>I hope you enjoyed it as well.</i>

604
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,380
Play it again.

605
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,820
I can't. The video is gone.

606
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,580
Elvira, you're mom's here!

607
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,940
- Elvira!
- I'm coming!

608
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:46,700
<i>It's been almost a year since this
happened. A completely ordinary year.</i>

609
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,580
<i>The only thing that changed is that
I'm not afraid of being alone anymore.</i>

610
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,900
- Should we...
- Do you mean...?

611
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:00,260
Yes, we should.

612
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,980
<i>Although maybe I should be afraid
of being alone.</i>

613
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:21,460
<i>I still think of Mebel sometimes.</i>

614
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,780
<i>And know Bea and Meja do as well.</i>

615
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:29,020
<i>We know she's there. And waiting.</i>

616
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,780
<i>Find me.</i>
