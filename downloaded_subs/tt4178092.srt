1
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,806
Hi, you must be Casey?

2
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,100
Yes, I am. Hello.

3
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,300
- How you doing? Simon.
- Hi, Simon.

4
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,940
My wife, Robyn.
Sorry we kept you waiting.

5
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,820
No, it's no problem.

6
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,260
It was a little tough
getting up here, but...

7
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,300
- Yeah?
- We made it.

8
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,420
- But worth it.
- Yeah.

9
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,940
Look at the koi pond in the entryway.

10
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,660
I absolutely think it is fantastic.

11
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,940
But no fish?

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,725
No fish. You have
to bring your own fish.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,900
- This is a mid-century modern home.
- Right.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,620
- And so it has a very open floor plan.
- Mmm-hmm.

15
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,700
Lots of light, which
I love myself, personally.

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,883
- And this fireplace, oversized fireplace.
- Mmm.

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,444
So what brings you to California then?

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,140
Well, I've got a new job.

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,891
- Oh, congratulations.
- Yeah. Very excited.

20
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,100
So you guys are from Chicago?

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,220
My wife is. I actually grew up
a little bit south of here.

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,890
We are making a fresh start.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,525
So there's your office.

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,260
Hmm?

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,060
It's not exactly what we're looking for,
but kind of interesting, right?

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,420
Good view?

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,060
- You like it?
- What do you think?

28
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,491
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,121
Mmm-hmm.

30
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,580
Stupid sop.

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,886
You want to see the bedrooms?

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,241
Yeah, I'm gonna have a look.

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,940
A quick shop, and then...

34
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,700
No, no, then we'll
get it done really fast.

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,180
A quick shop,
and then the store's closed.

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,645
Yeah, because what time does the...

37
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,086
Okay.

38
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,209
- How is your day today?
- It's good.

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,051
All righty. Is that
all for you today then?

40
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,300
Except for one thing my wife's going
to bring down soon, I hope.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,641
No problem. I'll just look
for a delivery date then.

42
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,260
Yeah, please, and is the end
of today too ambitious?

43
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,540
- It's late, isn't it?
- Yeah, our truck already passed.

44
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,380
Tomorrow work? I have a window
from, like, 7:00 to 9:00?

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,900
Sounds good to me.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,445
Hey, excuse me.

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,180
- Hi.
- Hi.

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,001
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm... I think I know you.

49
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,100
Yeah? I'm sorry,
I don't... Can't place you.

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,043
Is your name Simon? Simon Callem?

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,003
Yeah, Simon. Hi.

52
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,170
How do we know each other?

53
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,300
I thought... We went to school together.

54
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,460
- Really? Huh.
- Yeah.

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,420
- Which one? Fairmount...
- Fairmount Park.

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,567
- Really.
- Yeah.

57
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,580
Same grade? What year did you graduate?

58
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,681
Hey, honey.

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,100
Excuse me, one second.

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,100
- They close in 15 minutes.
- Okay, sure. We will rush.

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,540
This is my wife, Robyn.
This is... I didn't catch your name, sorry.

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,260
- Gordon Mosley. Gordo.
- Hi. Gordon.

63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,407
- Robyn.
- Gordo?

64
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,260
- Right.
- Wow! Buddy, I did not recognize you.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,566
Gordon Mosley.

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,300
Oh, my gosh, honey. Gordo and I
went to school together like...

67
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,580
- I don't know, what, 80 years ago?
- Really?

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,523
- My God. Wow!
- Almost.

69
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,460
- Sorry, excuse me, I just...
- You look very different.

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,340
- Yes, sorry.
- ...need your address, for the...

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,980
Oh, Yeah. 32 Castlewood.

72
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,980
- That is so crazy.
- Just one word.

73
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,525
We just moved here from Chicago.

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,940
Oh. Great city.

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
So he's moved home then?

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,460
- Well.
- Well, almost home.

77
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,580
Close to. Close to, not quite.

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,780
- You're going to love it.
- Yeah.

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,291
- You know.
- Well, yeah.

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,802
We have to get going,
but we... We should...

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,940
- Why don't you get Gordo's phone number?
- Sure.

82
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,820
And we'll call and
we'll catch up, right?

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,420
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

84
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,409
- Right?
- Great, that's perfect.

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,140
- Here, do you want to...
- All right.

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,340
Gordo, I'm so sorry
we don't have time to catch up.

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,521
It's here.

88
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,761
Great.

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,700
But life good though?

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,087
Yeah, you know, I can't complain.

91
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,580
- That's great to hear.
- You know? Yes.

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,900
Really, really good to see you.
I'm glad you said hi.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,460
- See you.
- Okay. We'll call you.

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,620
Nice to meet you, Robyn.

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,245
Good to meet you too.

96
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,660
Super awkward.
Whole first half of the conversation,

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,180
I had no idea who that guy was.

98
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,881
Seemed like a nice guy.

100
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,087
Yeah.

101
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,260
We're not going to be late.
Stop worrying.

102
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,010
- I'm not worrying.
- Hey. Hi.

103
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,051
- Hello.
- Hi.

104
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,690
Lucy and Ron.

105
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,810
Hi. I'd be Ron.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,567
Robyn.

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,445
Welcome to the neighborhood.

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,220
- Thank you.
- Are you settling in okay?

109
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,401
Yeah.

110
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,241
If you want to come by for a cup
of tea or a glass of wine, you know,

111
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,522
- I'm here all the time, so...
- Sounds good.

112
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,940
- Okay. Good to meet you.
- Take care.

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,100
Bye.

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,202
Sweetie, hold on a second.

115
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,881
I'll be right there.

116
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,180
House looks nice.

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,700
Oh. Yeah.

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,609
- Is that it right there?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,963
Go, take a look.
Wait, here, this is the note.

121
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,250
"Welcome home," smiley face, "Gordo."

122
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,086
How did he get our address?

123
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,806
I have no idea.

124
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,441
I suppose we should thank him.

125
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,281
Okay, okay.

126
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,180
She's beautiful.

127
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,660
Oh, thank you.

128
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,569
What? You are.

129
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,380
You want to say hi to Robyn?

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,020
- You want to go say hi? Here you go.
- Oh.

131
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,451
Thank you.

132
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,409
Hey. It's okay. Shh. Hey.

133
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,804
Hi. Hi.

134
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,846
You're a natural.

135
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,530
Do you want one?

136
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,167
Yeah.

137
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,765
We're trying.

138
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,322
I was pregnant, actually,
last year, in Chicago.

139
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,682
It wasn't a very happy ending.

140
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,691
It sent me into a bit of a rough patch.

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,163
I will bore you
with the details some other time.

142
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,683
Yeah, no, I revised the plan
to include the open staircase.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,220
If you want, my assistant is in Chicago.
She can get you a hard copy.

144
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,448
Okay. Great.

145
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,361
- Oh.
- Hi.

146
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,369
- Hello.
- Gordo.

147
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. Gordo, hi.

148
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

149
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,081
Hi.

150
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,780
- Hey, Gordo, how are you?
- How are you?

151
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,881
- Hi.
- It's nice to see you.

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,940
Oh, hello.

153
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,087
Hi. How you doing?

154
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,201
Good. How are you?

155
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,845
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah.

156
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,340
Is Simon home?

157
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,940
No. He's at work.
Yeah, setting up the new office.

158
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,041
Oh.

159
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,300
Hey. Thank you for the lovely gift.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,140
That was very sweet,

161
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,322
but I'm sure that you
spoke to Simon about that.

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,561
Uh...

163
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,724
Well, he might have left me a message.

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,980
Oh. Well, maybe we wrote
the number down wrong.

165
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,323
Well, you see I made you a list.

166
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,604
Local people, like plumbers,
gardeners, maids...

167
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,980
- All that good stuff.
- That's very considerate.

168
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,100
Thank you.

169
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,140
And that's me.

170
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,083
There you are. Gordo.

171
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,046
Oh, and...

172
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,244
- Here you go. Yeah.
- What is it? Glass cleaner?

173
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,640
- For cleaning glass.
- Right.

174
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,171
- I saw how much you had.
- Yeah.

175
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,604
- There you go.
- Thank you.

176
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,926
Welcome.

177
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,286
Very sweet of you. Thanks, Gordo.

178
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,926
I gotta say,
I really, I love this house.

179
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,891
- You do? Huh.
- Wow.

180
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,087
Yeah, I really like
this style of architecture.

181
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,968
Well, you should come in
and take the tour then.

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm sure Simon will be back soon.

183
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,900
- Come on in.
- Oh, all right.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,380
- Yeah. Come on in.
- Sure?

185
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,448
- Yeah. It's fine.
- Okay.

186
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,287
He's so excited not to be
cooped up in a condo anymore.

187
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,807
That's the laundry
room slash Jangles' room.

188
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,286
Down there is some storage.

189
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,849
That is going to be Simon's office.

190
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,047
Bedroom, or studio for me, I'm hoping.

191
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,208
And in here is the...

192
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,845
Oh, yeah. I was just
sorting all that stuff out.

193
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,607
Hmm.

194
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,366
Yeah, I know. It was a gift
and then it turned out that

195
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,324
Simon has a phobia of monkeys
from when he was a kid.

196
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,162
He's like, terrified.
I have to get rid of it. You want it?

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,371
Do you have a baby?

198
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,365
No. No.

199
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,845
Just the dog, for now.
Mr. Bojangles, after the song.

200
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,220
I'm going to move that stuff around
the back there and then plant

201
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,086
and, I don't know,
maybe fill a pond here up with fish,

202
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,940
since it's just sitting there, and yeah...

203
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,883
I mean that's pretty much it.

204
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,887
It's going to come up looking
real nice. It's already great.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,081
Thank you.

206
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,521
I should go and check on that.

207
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,285
In fact, there's plenty of food.

208
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,020
I'm not that great a cook,

209
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,601
but why don't I check in with Simon,
and maybe we can all eat together?

210
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,926
Oh, I don't want to...

211
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,371
Yeah.

212
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,885
Hey, it's me.

213
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,445
I'm cooking, believe it or not,
and we have a guest.

214
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,931
Call me.

215
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,961
Well. Good.

216
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,020
You know, I often think about
this person from school

217
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,820
- and that person from school.
- Yeah?

218
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,446
About what are they up to,
what are they doing, and I often...

219
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,924
But I always knew that Simon

220
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,820
would be one of those people
who would make something of himself.

221
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,540
You have. Clearly, you have.
And you did.

222
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,405
I mean, I'm very happy for you.

223
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,930
- Thank you.
- I am. I'm very happy for you.

224
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,446
Want a little more?

225
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,726
Oh, please.

226
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,481
No problem.

227
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,367
So you never see anybody
from high school?

228
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,300
What about Greg? Greg Pierson.

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,500
No, I really, I haven't talked to anybody
since the day we graduated.

230
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,140
You want more pasta?

231
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,605
- Oh, no, I'm fine.
- You sure?

232
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,060
You were such good friends.

233
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,321
Not sure he needs any more of that.

234
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,441
- Really?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,561
Okay.

236
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,004
So, Simon, Robyn says that
you work in security systems.

237
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,802
Yeah, security for large corporations.

238
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,700
Like in, you know,
information protection.

239
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,060
Yeah. Complicated stuff.

240
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,900
- Complicated?
- Yeah, but I only sell it.

241
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,580
I don't know how to use it.

242
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,682
We're developing more
and more for personal use,

243
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,768
not just the corporate sector.

244
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,929
Kind of widening out.

245
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,420
And what do you think about this
whole government thing of, you know,

246
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,363
listening in to people's
private information?

247
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,324
- I mean, that's crazy stuff.
- Who knows?

248
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,568
I mean, fuck them, you know?

249
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,202
An eye for an eye, I say.

250
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,167
Yeah.

251
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,607
Anyway, this is a conversation
for another time.

252
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,485
But speaking of government,

253
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,660
did you know that
Simon was class president?

254
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,540
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.

255
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,926
Mr. President.

256
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,420
Please, people will think he's...

257
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,162
He had a very organized campaign,
"Simon Says."

258
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,460
Like the children's game.

259
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,562
Well, his campaign
was based around the game,

260
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,684
so Simon says, and it would happen.

261
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,580
"I will make it happen."
Simon says, "More time for sports."

262
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,660
Simon says, "More
choice in the cafeteria."

263
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,980
And it happens.

264
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,580
She gets it. You got it, right?

265
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,900
So is it, do you have, like, a poster?

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,780
Posters. Leaflets.

267
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,041
- Buttons.
- Buttons?

268
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,260
Parades...

269
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,206
Simon says, "New job." Right?

270
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,260
- Simon says, "Beautiful wife and a new home."
- Aww.

271
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,780
Well, see? Should have
no problems starting a family.

272
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,848
Because Simon says.

273
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,803
My God, I had one too many wines.

274
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,729
- I just talk way too much then.
- No.

275
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,444
- No.
- No, I talked too much.

276
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,360
What's happened to you
since high school? Everything good?

277
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,406
Military.

278
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,126
- Yeah.
- Really?

279
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,460
Yeah, it's true.
Military, straight out of school.

280
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,281
Two tours, and then I got out of there,

281
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,051
and just ended up doing a lot of things.

282
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,660
But, I mean, a whole lot has happened
to me since we last saw each other.

283
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,100
Some good, some bad, like life.
You know, mostly good.

284
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,283
But, you know, I believe
that a lot of the good

285
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,980
- could come from the bad, you know?
- I hear you.

286
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,321
If you put the right
faith behind it, you know?

287
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,250
Not to bring religion into it, God,

288
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,847
but just to say that the bad things,
they can be a gift.

289
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,340
- Absolutely.
- And that's just the way I like to see things.

290
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,771
Yeah, that's good.

291
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,769
Hey, I'm very happy for you.

292
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,404
Thank you very much.

293
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,850
I am. Very, very,
very happy for you and...

294
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,762
So I'd like to make a toast.

295
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,485
Simon says a toast.

296
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,540
- Gordo says a toast.
- Gordo says a toast.

297
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,847
To old friends and...

298
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,883
- New ones.
- New friends.

299
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,361
Thank you.

300
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,410
Are you okay?

301
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,371
Yeah. Yeah, sorry, I was just thinking.

302
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,700
You know, it's so amazing
how some people change

303
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,740
so much after high school
and some just stay exactly the same.

304
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,491
You know what I mean?
I feel kind of bad for him.

305
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,420
Did he seem right to you?
That guy is odd.

306
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,220
He is a little socially awkward,

307
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,766
but, I mean, I can be that way.

308
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,651
I think that guy's delusional.

309
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,088
He thinks we're friends.

310
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,287
The whole thing just has me
very uncomfortable, but...

311
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,686
Okay.

312
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,020
It was just one dinner and it's over.

313
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,645
No one's saying you have to do it again.

314
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
- I just feel bad.
- Yeah.

315
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,685
Can I have that sponge, please?

316
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,884
Aren't you forgetting something?

317
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,205
Simon says.

318
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,006
No.

319
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,780
...introduce you to some
of the members of the team.

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,940
- You might recognize your new bosses.
- Hi.

321
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,530
They wanted to be here
to welcome you in person,

322
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,820
but they are in Tokyo
looking to expand the empire.

323
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,300
- Danny!
- How are you?

324
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,925
- Simon, this is Danny McDonald.
- Hello.

325
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,980
- Hi.
- He runs Legal.

326
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,660
Simon. This is my wife, Robyn.

327
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,460
- Robyn, hi.
- And his lovely wife, Gina.

328
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,100
It's Janine, actually,
but she'll answer to anything.

329
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,281
Great.

330
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,731
Guys, let me bring you
through to meet my wife.

331
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,940
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Good to see you, Danny.

332
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,260
- Hey, so this... Guys, this is my wife. Duffy.
- Hi.

333
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,600
Hi. I've heard so much about you.

334
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,960
Hi there, Duffy, my wife, Robyn.

335
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,300
- Hello, Robyn.
- Hello, you're so pretty.

336
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,780
- Hi, there.
- And this is, of course, Wendy Dale.

337
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,980
She's spearheading
Mergers and Acquisitions.

338
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,980
Can I grab two of those? Here.

339
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,290
Let's kick this party off with a toast
here to welcome the new blood.

340
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,860
- I don't actually...
- She's the designated driver, so...

341
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,340
- I'm so sorry. I'll take it.
- Two for me.

342
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,300
Or you can take it. There we go.

343
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,084
What do you do, Robyn?

344
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,260
She's a brilliant designer, right?

345
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,140
Tell them. Brag. Brag a little bit.

346
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,820
She's very, very good.

347
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,660
No, I freelance
a little for consulting firms.

348
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,380
She's being modest.

349
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,323
She was running a big firm in Chicago,

350
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,220
which is happening
online for the moment,

351
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,700
and she's designing the interiors
of the home we just moved into right now.

352
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,620
- That's a big job. Yeah. Great.
- Great.

353
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,929
We're also very busy working
on trying to start a family,

354
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,220
- and that takes a lot of time.
- Oh.

355
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,481
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

356
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,161
Oh.

357
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,610
What do you think?

358
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,340
- Very nice.
- Isn't it?

359
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,169
- Yeah.
- You should see upstairs.

360
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,123
You should see Kevin's
office. That's nice.

361
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,123
- Uh-huh.
- But this is, it's pretty great.

362
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,081
Yeah. Here they are.

363
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,807
I cannot believe these
guys are your bosses.

364
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,900
You are my boss, honey. Let's be clear.

365
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,540
These guys just run the billion dollar
company I work for.

366
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,380
You know they've been multimillionaires
since they were teenagers? Mmm-hmm.

367
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,720
Crazy.

368
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,620
Yeah, once upon a time,
the crusty old men ran the companies

369
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,380
and the teenagers
were down in the mail room.

370
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,323
And now it's the total opposite.

371
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,540
But I'm going to make it upstairs
before I'm too old,

372
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,420
as long as Kevin sticks to his plan
of moving on at the end of the year.

373
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,888
Then I get a little bit of consulting
expertise from you, I'll be all set.

374
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,527
Keep growing the beard.
Start wearing sneakers to work.

375
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,888
- Maybe get a tattoo.
- Yeah.

376
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,570
All good ideas.

377
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,003
I'd look good in those glasses, I think.

378
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,681
Hey, do you really not
want me to go back to work?

379
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,580
- Are you still worried?
- That's not what I said.

380
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,740
- No?
- No.

381
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,649
You know, we moved to the suburbs and...

382
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,500
Yeah. For a fresh start.

383
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,207
Honey, I want you to do
whatever you want to do.

384
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,140
As long as you stay healthy,

385
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,620
you can open an office
in every major city in the world.

386
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,566
I want you to start rebuilding the business.
You know, what do I care?

387
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,604
I just don't want you
to be stressed, honey,

388
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,047
because that's when those
other things can happen. Yeah?

389
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,770
Especially if you really
want to start a family.

390
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,405
Okay.

391
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,688
- Did it sound that bad?
- No.

392
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,780
No, I'm just being silly.

393
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,041
Let's get back to the party.

394
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,241
Okay.

395
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,940
- They're charming. Right?
- Yeah.

396
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,300
And they'll probably have good
dirty jokes every once in a while.

397
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,970
What have we got?

398
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,241
Here.

399
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,450
Uh-oh. "Thanks for a lovely dinner.

400
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,860
- "Return the favor."
- No.

401
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,644
"Hope you don't mind."

402
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,446
Smiley face.

403
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,900
Fish food.

404
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,967
Oh.

405
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,647
Oh, no.

406
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,606
Well, we have to thank him this time.

407
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,180
For what? Coming onto
our property without asking?

408
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,169
No. This is not troubling to you?

409
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,740
I really don't think that he
meant it to be troubling.

410
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,161
He wouldn't see it like that, he just...

411
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,011
He just thinks he's giving us some fish.

412
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,682
You know, they used to
call him Weirdo in school.

413
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,282
Gordo the Weirdo.

414
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,380
That's not very nice.

415
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,164
Everybody had a name.

416
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,724
I was Simple Simon.

417
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,569
Yeah. Kids.

418
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,810
Kids are mean.

419
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,485
Kids are honest.

420
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,403
Why do you get a name like Weirdo?

421
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,041
Hmm?

422
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,522
Well, I think that he's misunderstood.

423
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,900
- Maybe.
- Mmm.

424
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,260
It's not our job to
figure out what he is.

425
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,460
Sure.

426
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,980
I can tell you he's a reverse thief.

427
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,811
Breaking in to give us something?
It's not very bright.

428
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,081
Right. Mmm-hmm.

429
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,645
I hope his next gift
is a sushi knife for those fish.

430
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,089
You got a new friend.

431
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,100
Ha-ha.

432
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,980
Someone's got a buddy.

433
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,081
Mmm-hmm.

434
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,487
Hi. I was in the area.
I was wondering, is... Oh.

435
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,926
Hey.

436
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,890
Is Simon home?

437
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,051
No. He's at work. Yeah.

438
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,930
I wanted to call you, actually,
to say thank you for what you did.

439
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,289
The fish are beautiful.
Really beautiful. Thank you.

440
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,286
Well, ask and thou shall receive,
huh, Mr. Bojangles?

441
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,420
You know, most people think
that Sammy Davis Jr. or Nina Simone

442
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,820
wrote Mr. Bojangles,
but it's actually written by a guy

443
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,402
called Jerry Jeff Walker
who hardly anybody knows about.

444
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,491
- Really?
- Yeah.

445
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,366
Did not know that.

446
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,085
My dad named him, actually.

447
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,251
- Well.
- Yeah.

448
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,441
I was just about to make a pot of tea.
Do you drink tea?

449
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,260
- Yeah.
- Well, come in.

450
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,566
You can leave a note for Simon.

451
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,886
Okay.

452
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,380
I guess I speak to
some girls from high school,

453
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,860
the ones I was closest to.

454
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,009
Most of them, most of them
have children now.

455
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,927
Yep, that ought to do it.

456
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,330
Right, let's see.

457
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,848
- 40% less than the big-box guys!
- Hey.

458
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,740
Choose your favorite way
to save even more...

459
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,740
Simon's going to love you for this.

460
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,208
...save 25% in finance,
interest free for 24 months,

461
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,020
or save 20% in financing,
interest free for 36 months.

462
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,805
What do you usually watch at this hour?

463
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,324
Oh, nothing. I should be working.

464
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,922
Like, really, I should get back to work.

465
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,162
Oh, of course. Sorry.

466
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,688
Thank you though.
Really, so much for this.

467
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,980
It's a pleasure.
You know, they really make it seem,

468
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,100
you know, far more complicated
than it really should be.

469
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,440
Hey, leave that. I will do it.

470
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,380
- No, it's fine, really. Really.
- You've already done too much.

471
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,811
Where do these live?

472
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,251
In the drawer under the microwave.

473
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,900
Oh.

474
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,287
And the trash goes...

475
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,684
Trash goes outside.

476
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,571
Normally, friendships grow organically.

477
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,100
And if they don't serve both parties,
they just kind of organically dissipate.

478
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,300
Yeah, that'd be great.

479
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,420
What you're talking about is,
you know, an asymmetric thing.

480
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,329
A one-sided friendship?

481
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,928
I mean, essentially you're being
forced into a breakup.

482
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,660
- Yeah.
- No. No.

483
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,491
Although no, no, no. To be fair,
this guy actually sounds like an asset,

484
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,020
so I think you should
let him finish the house

485
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,860
and finish the garden and then
you cut the fucking guy loose.

486
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,327
You know what,
I actually think he's nice.

487
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,044
And he's been very generous.

488
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,460
So then he saw the thing
that you wrote and then, what?

489
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,608
Yeah. So get this for confusing.

490
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,740
After he'd supposedly been offended
by what I wrote on the board,

491
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,660
he calls us a few hours later on the phone
and he invites us to a dinner party.

492
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,300
- At his house.
- Alone?

493
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,780
No. With another couple.

494
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,020
Well, surely you're not going
to accept the invitation.

495
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,340
After the whole insult thing,
I'm surprised he wants you around at all.

496
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,540
Unless he wants
to chop you guys up with an axe.

497
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,300
Yeah. Maybe he didn't see
what you wrote.

498
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,129
No, I'm pretty sure that he did.

499
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,924
Maybe he doesn't care.

500
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,447
Or he cares more about...

501
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,020
To not worry about it.

502
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,361
In this guy's defense,
she is way too nice, right?

503
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,580
- Yes.
- You two know that.

504
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,286
You're a bit of a door-half-open
kind of person?

505
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,900
I love you for it, but you know.

506
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,809
You could just politely decline,

507
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,729
and then not offer another alternative.

508
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,649
But he would offer
an alternative, you know?

509
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,500
He'll keep coming around
and around and around, so...

510
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,180
So basically, eventually,
you two need to have a conversation.

511
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,300
That's what I'm thinking.
That's why I'm considering it.

512
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,528
I think you guys should be careful.

513
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,060
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't accept.

514
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,340
No. Me neither.

515
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,604
Well, I for one, would love to know
what happens if you do go.

516
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,006
Stop it.

517
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,451
As I said, I doubt we will.

518
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,322
Let's just try to
have a nice time, okay?

519
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,331
Yeah.

520
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,691
Holy shit.

521
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,281
Wow.

522
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,205
Got the right address, huh?

523
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,810
Yeah. I think so.

524
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,366
Ridiculous.

525
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,246
Guess we're first, too.

526
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,566
Yeah.

527
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,780
Hi.

528
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

529
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,890
- Got you something.
- Oh.

530
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,764
- Yeah.
- Wow. Thank you.

531
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,366
- Good to see you.
- Come on in.

532
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,682
- Robyn, you look lovely.
- Thank you.

533
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,060
This is some place you've got.

534
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,721
Wow. Yeah. It is something.

535
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,660
- Very impressive.
- Good for you, Gordo.

536
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,842
Gosh. Got a fire.

537
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,260
What an incredible place.

538
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,682
So, hey, take a seat, and why don't...

539
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,209
- Let's have a drink.
- What's this?

540
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,860
Oh, that's a gift. That's for you.

541
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,961
Huh.

542
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,564
What did you get?

543
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,340
Ooh. Great movie.

544
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,044
- Apocalypse Now, huh?
- Yeah.

545
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,300
It's going to be great
on your speaker system.

546
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,860
When The Ride of the Valkyries comes on,

547
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,580
it's going to sound like the choppers
are going from left to right. Like...

548
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,780
You know, around the room, see?

549
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,927
Yeah.

550
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,500
That's going to be amazing.
Thank you so much.

551
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,300
So, I guess Simon, red wine?

552
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,540
- Yes, please.
- Right.

553
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,300
Robyn? You don't drink?

554
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,500
- No. I don't.
- Water's fine?

555
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,140
- I got juice?
- Oh, no, water's fine.

556
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,860
- Gatorade?
- No, water is fine.

557
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,166
Okay.

558
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,608
So the other couple, do we know them?

559
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,180
- Are they friends of yours?
- Yeah.

560
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,921
Yeah, they just literally canceled.

561
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,284
They had a babysitter, I guess. She...

562
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,126
Lined up, and then she fell through.

563
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,900
So it's just us three.
Or is your wife going to join us?

564
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,980
Are you married?

565
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,740
I don't know if I ever asked you
if you were married.

566
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,287
That's a long story. I forgot crackers.

567
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,683
Yeah, that's a long story.
The short version is no.

568
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,441
Crackers.

569
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,647
Not married.

570
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,170
- Hello?
- Okay.

571
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,606
What do you want?

572
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,528
I'm with, uh, people.

573
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,846
That salami looks good, huh?

574
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,122
Hey, be nice. He's made an effort.

575
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,530
I'm really sorry.

576
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,725
That's an urgent work thing.

577
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,740
I'm going to have to step out
for a couple of minutes,

578
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,900
but it's not going to take me long.

579
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,100
I'll literally be less than five minutes.
Less than that.

580
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,380
Can you just relax? Have a drink?

581
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,380
I'll be back as soon
as I can, I'm sorry.

582
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,526
Gordo?

583
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,928
Did he just leave us here?

584
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,962
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think he did.

585
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,780
- Is his car...
- He's leaving us alone in his house?

586
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,370
He doesn't even know us.

587
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,244
- Yeah, well...
- What?

588
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,688
Maybe it's an emergency.

589
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,369
Well, he did say it
was an urgent work thing.

590
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,405
What is it that he even does?
This is... This is...

591
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,100
Bizarre... Would we ever do this?

592
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,569
Well, no, but technically
I would be at home to

593
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,620
look after guests if you
had to go somewhere.

594
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,980
- He hasn't got anyone, a wife or...
- Honey, don't defend him.

595
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,286
Or whatever.

596
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,660
I'll tell you why he
doesn't have a wife.

597
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,140
He'd like to be married to you.

598
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,420
He'd like you to be his wife.

599
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,260
- Oh, God, Simon.
- Yep.

600
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,523
Come on, honey. This guy likes you
so much. Tell me you don't see it.

601
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,100
- Come on.
- I really don't think that is the reason why.

602
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,690
Come on, honey.

603
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,930
Why all the drop in's and the stop by's

604
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,565
only when you're home alone?

605
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,808
Look at this thing. Good Lord.

606
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,500
I think you're slightly exaggerating.

607
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,300
I think he's obsessed with you, honey.

608
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,260
I think he wants to nail you.

609
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,500
I think he wants to be me,

610
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,700
- wants to move into the house...
- Stop it.

611
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,780
He wants to play mommies
and daddies with you,

612
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,980
the creepy little fucker.

613
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,003
Simon, don't be crass.

614
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,846
I'm Gordo the Weirdo.

615
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,380
And I want to make crazy,
weird love to you,

616
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,140
with my creepy,

617
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,121
with my creepy little
pee-pee pleasey-weasy.

618
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,340
- Put it away.
- I'm Gordo the Weirdo

619
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,500
- and I want you all to myself.
- I don't like it. No.

620
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,601
- Can I have you?
- No.

621
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,006
- Can I have you, please? Why not?
- No, no! Please!

622
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,600
- Why not?
- Because you're disgusting.

623
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,370
He is disgusting.

624
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,083
Disgusting and weird.

625
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,483
Let's just check this place out.
Come on. Come on.

626
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,241
Okay.

627
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,285
Simon?

628
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,447
Simon, he could come back any second.
What are you doing?

629
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,524
He's not married, huh?

630
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,900
Maybe it's just his spring stuff.

631
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,684
Look, I think we should
go back downstairs

632
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,804
- before he comes back.
- What have we got down here?

633
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,340
Simon?

634
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,647
- You hear that?
- What is it?

635
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,644
Ugh, monkeys.

636
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,725
He's a dad?

637
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,441
Hmm.

638
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,891
Shit, shit. Shit, shit.

639
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,481
Wait, wait! Simon!

640
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,167
- Drink some of your drink.
- What?

641
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,060
- Hey.
- Hi.

642
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,764
Everything okay?

643
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,660
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

644
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,570
That was, yeah, I'm sorry about that.

645
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,251
- Yeah, what was that? That was...
- Yeah, what happened?

646
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,889
Don't worry about it.

647
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,808
Hey, what is it that you do?

648
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,500
I mean, the reason that you left.
The work thing.

649
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,011
I don't think I've ever asked you that.

650
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,283
What is it that you...
What do you actually do?

651
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,420
What do you do to afford all of this?

652
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,726
Simon.

653
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,684
Are you not curious?

654
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,011
I'm afraid that you've
caught me in a lie.

655
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,727
A lie?

656
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
I wasn't dealing with a work thing.

657
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,324
I was out speaking to my ex-wife,

658
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,849
who recently left me.

659
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,965
Actually, a couple of days before
I saw you at the Homeware store.

660
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,243
And we have a couple of beautiful children,
and she's taken both of them.

661
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,403
And I don't really mention it
because it makes me very upset

662
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,300
and I don't really know
what's going to happen.

663
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,051
And obviously I really
want to make it work

664
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,766
and I don't really
know what the chances are.

665
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,762
And, technically, this is her home,

666
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,527
her family home, so it's their money.

667
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,340
And at the moment,
she holds all the cards

668
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,331
so when she says jump, I have to...

669
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,761
Jump.

670
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,041
Jump. Um...

671
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,060
Which is why I went out there
to speak to her on the phone,

672
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,460
because I didn't want you both

673
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,882
to hear the conversation
which gets a little heated.

674
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,340
And just listening to me speak,

675
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,283
I feel very embarrassed right now.

676
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,282
Well, don't be embarrassed.

678
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,620
It's really okay.

679
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,449
Well, I lied to you.

680
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,964
Listen, hey, why don't we,
why don't we eat?

681
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,380
- Well, I...
- Yes, sure.

682
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,565
Actually why don't... I think
you and I should have a little talk.

683
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,962
Honey, can you give us
a couple of minutes, please?

684
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,206
Here.

685
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,140
Can you just go wait
out in the car for me, please?

686
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,527
Just give me like five minutes,
I'll be right out.

687
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,008
- Then we're going to go home, okay?
- Okay.

688
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,165
I'm so sorry.

689
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,365
- This is...
- Is everything okay because...

690
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,820
Yeah. Hang on one second.

691
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,168
So this is a very, very...

692
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,011
There's no easy way to say this.

693
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,565
Well, I mean, just say whatever...

694
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,860
Don't interrupt me,
because I gotta power right through it

695
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,380
and then you can talk
right afterwards, okay?

696
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,580
Okay.

697
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,971
I think that we would prefer
that you don't visit us anymore.

698
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,841
You know, you should take some time

699
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,361
with this thing that
you just told us about.

700
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,420
That's heavy stuff, you know? This is...

701
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,806
Honey?

702
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,603
Please, can you just give
us a couple of minutes?

703
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,060
- Okay.
- Thank you.

704
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,571
Two minutes.

705
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,601
Okay, I did it.

706
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,522
Sometimes you just gotta
rip off the Band-Aid, right?

707
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,440
Come on.

708
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,970
Is this guy playing games?

709
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,220
Oh, come on.

710
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,401
Should I...

711
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,140
Open the goddamn gate.

712
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,740
- Okay, Simon.
- Wait here.

713
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,444
Simon, hold on, maybe he'll...

714
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,121
Si.

715
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,171
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

716
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,571
Pardon me, one second.

717
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,540
Honey, is everything all right?

718
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,246
I'm right in the middle of a...

719
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,330
Are you serious?

720
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,740
Don't touch them,

721
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,763
and don't touch the water.

722
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,380
Jangles is gone.

723
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,484
I've been looking.
I can't find him anywhere.

724
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,004
That son of a bitch.

725
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,531
Son of a bitch. All right,
I'll be right back.

726
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,485
- Hi.
- Hi.

727
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,167
I need to speak to Gordo.

728
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,442
- I think you have the wrong house.
- No, no.

729
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,060
I got the right place.
I just need to speak to him, please.

730
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,980
- Speak to who?
- Gordo. Your husband.

731
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,540
Gordon. Get him down here.

732
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,766
My husband's name is Mike.

733
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,041
Mike?

734
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,207
Okay. I got that, yeah.

735
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,100
Okay.

736
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,886
The dog's tag says Mr. Bojangles?

737
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,260
Like the song?

738
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,700
Yeah. But he responds to Jangles.

739
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,801
Hmm.

740
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,440
So they knew him.

741
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,580
Well, the husband did, Mr. Ryan.

742
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,820
He has a fleet of limousines and cars

743
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,620
for an executive transport service
business type thing or what not,

744
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,580
and he leased a car to Mr. Mosley.

745
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,286
Now Mr. Ryan says that Mr. Mosley

746
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,900
actually had access to his garage

747
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,540
so that he could pick up
and return a Cadillac,

748
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,380
which is probably how he gained
access to the main house,

749
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,926
and why he knew the Ryans
were on vacation in Cancún.

750
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,964
But I assume he won't be
working as a driver anymore.

751
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,420
They could press more
serious charges if they wanted.

752
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,180
Um, the dog is what I'm concerned with.

753
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,204
Yeah, it really could just be
that it's a new neighborhood for him

754
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,820
- and we did leave the gate open.
- No. No.

755
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,888
Who killed the fish then, honey?

756
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,140
He took the dog, I think.
Pretty sure he took the dog.

757
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,020
Well, you know, that's a tricky one

758
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,900
because I can go there and see him,
but that's not the problem.

759
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,241
- You know where he lives?
- We can find that out.

760
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,603
But the problem is,
I just can't go there

761
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,620
and look inside without a warrant.

762
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,780
And to get a warrant,
I need proof of some kind,

763
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,780
- which neither of us have.
- Well...

764
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,620
Which just leaves me
with that awkward task

765
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,300
of paying him a visit and asking,
"Did you take the dog?"

766
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,529
and asking him did he take
the dog means that,

767
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,525
well, he's going to know who sent me.

768
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,246
Hello?

769
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,860
Well, I mean, if you think
he's a threat or whatever,

770
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,220
I'm happy to go over
there and take a look.

771
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,642
No. No, really. It's nothing.

772
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,420
Do you think he would
actually do this though?

773
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,885
I mean, take your dog?

774
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,840
I really don't want to
believe that he would.

775
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,740
But who knows? Like I said,

776
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,780
it's probably all in my head.

777
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,660
I mean, I have been
having trouble sleeping.

778
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,660
Thank you, but I don't want to impose.

779
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,420
- I should go.
- Hey. Don't be silly.

780
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,700
It's fine. You're not imposing.

781
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,529
You're a welcome distraction, honestly.

782
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,847
Have some coffee and I'll check on her.
I'll be back.

783
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,420
- Thank you.
- Sure.

784
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,329
Can I use your bathroom?

785
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,088
Hey? Simon?

786
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,451
Hey.

787
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,766
Hey.

788
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,366
Hey.

789
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,849
I think it's him.
I think he's messing with us.

790
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,206
Where have you been?

791
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,405
Hey.

792
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,122
Dear Robyn and Simon,

793
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,405
I guess I owe you both an apology.

794
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,770
It seems I have misjudged our situation.

795
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,860
Please know that I would never do
anything to upset you both,

796
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,860
and I really wish I
could start all over again.

797
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,247
However, I will honor your wishes

798
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,647
of leaving you be, i.e., alone.

799
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,540
You won't hear from me again,

800
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,529
except for this letter which I hope...

801
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,929
"...expresses how sorry I am
that things turned out the way they did.

802
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,608
"Gordo." Sad face.

803
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,004
"P.S... I also apologize
about the dinner.

804
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,060
"Without going into detail,

805
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,370
"I think I would feel ashamed
to have you see where I really live.

806
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,805
"I am not exactly the success story
that you both are.

807
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,685
"Stupid me."

808
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,322
No, another sad face.

809
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,490
Two sad faces.

810
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,020
Oy.

811
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,202
Turn it over. There's more.

812
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,820
"P.P.S... Simon, after all these years,

813
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,086
"I really was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

814
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,851
"I had nothing but good intentions."

815
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,686
- What does that mean?
- I do not know.

816
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,100
Really? Well, it must mean something.

817
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,740
I mean, "bygones be bygones,"
"after all these years."

818
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,683
Seriously, I have no idea
what he's talking about.

819
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,161
Huh.

820
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,883
Well, you're not forgetting
that this guy's not exactly stable?

821
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,740
But he seems okay, right?
Other than that?

822
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,820
And we're okay, Jangles is okay,
everybody's okay.

823
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,300
So whatever this was,
let's put it behind us.

824
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,882
Get him out of our minds,
and get on with it.

825
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,289
You know, what do you say?

826
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,860
Question mark, smiley face.

827
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,040
Simon?

828
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,980
...whole semester, I'm still
not going to admit that I did it.

829
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,540
You know, and anyway,
I never waffled. Yeah.

830
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,120
Now I know the guys gotta
catch a plane, so...

831
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,060
Thank you very much for sitting
and looking interested,

832
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,700
- very nice of you.
- I'll catch up with you.

833
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,564
Take care, you guys.

834
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,260
- They loved you.
- That was...

835
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,203
- They loved you.
- That felt pretty good.

836
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,220
Thank you very much for the vote
of confidence too, buddy.

837
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,540
Who else am I up against?
I don't want to get my hopes up,

838
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,220
you don't have to give me names,
but I just wanna know...

839
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,020
I don't mind giving you names.
There's only one other guy.

840
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,780
It's Danny McDonald
from Parker and Fitch.

841
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,220
Just the one?

842
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,561
I smell a promotion for you, buddy.

843
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,886
Hello?

844
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,321
Shoot.

845
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,131
Hi.

846
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,126
Hey, baby. Come on.

847
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,020
Hey.

848
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,610
- Hey.
- Morning.

849
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,500
I got coffee over here, honey.

850
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,220
Come sit down. I want to tell you
this funny story.

851
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,540
The brothers, I guess,
they went to my school.

852
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,725
Same school. Same physics teacher.

853
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,820
This guy, Dr. Elsowet.

854
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,260
And they told me that
he still has the same nickname

855
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,840
that I gave him 10 years ago.
Dr. Smells-a-Bit.

856
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,020
We had a good laugh about it.
Meeting went really, really well.

857
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,361
Kevin is in fact leaving

858
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,090
and they're only looking at one other
guy, so I got a really good shot at it.

859
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,284
That's great, honey.

860
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,525
Yeah, that is great.

861
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,689
I was very excited to share it
with you last night when I got home.

862
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,168
But you were out like a light.

863
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,683
Anything you want to tell me?

864
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,530
Anything at all?

865
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,851
Yeah?

866
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,851
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

867
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,248
I'm glad you said that, 'cause

868
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,530
this was a real bummer to find.

869
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,205
I thought we were done with all of that.

870
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,365
What's going on with you?

871
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,087
I thought we left all
this back in Chicago.

872
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,540
Robyn, you worked real fast here.

873
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,404
You got yourself a doctor too already?

874
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,289
Okay, okay, look.

875
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,524
Simon, I...

876
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,403
I need you to call him.

877
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,700
He made peace with us. I think
that we have to make peace with him.

878
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,860
What's he got to do with that?

879
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,740
'Cause I'm not feeling good right now.

880
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,900
I feel scared when I'm here by myself.

881
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,660
And I keep expecting him to show up.

882
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,980
Why would he?

883
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,402
I don't know. I can't
explain it. But look, I'm...

884
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,322
- It's made me kind of crazy. I...
- Yeah.

885
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,922
- You're probably paranoid from the pills.
- I'm scared. I had a fall.

886
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,082
- A fall.
- I fainted.

887
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,620
Well, that's a shocker, you know,
you're chewing pills.

888
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,660
No, it wasn't because of the pills.

889
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,140
- I didn't take any.
- Are you sure?

890
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,460
No, I didn't take any. No, I wasn't.

891
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,260
Are you mixing this stuff with anything?

892
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,340
This has nothing to do with pills
and no, I'm not mixing anything.

893
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,860
'Cause if you're mixing it with something
it's going to get really dangerous.

894
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,100
Do you want to turn the place
upside down like you did the last one?

895
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,680
Will you please just listen to me?

896
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,761
If we say sorry to him,
we will make this right

897
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,700
and I will feel better.

898
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,450
Robyn, it's over.

899
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,380
I said it, he said it,
he wrote a letter.

900
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,660
Yeah, what about the letter
suggests that it's over?

901
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,000
The whole thing.

902
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,967
What does "bygones be bygones" mean?

903
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,651
Oh, my God.

904
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,780
And Jangles.

905
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,700
I mean, if you still believe
that he took Jangles, which you do,

906
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,260
then it's not over
for him, is it? Is it?

907
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,780
You asked me if there's something
I want to tell you.

908
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,166
...this shit, it's over!

909
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,540
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

910
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,120
The subject is closed.

911
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,683
Look at what he's done to us.
This is his fault.

912
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,651
It's not my fault, it's not your fault.

913
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,089
That's why we've got to
just put it behind us.

914
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,600
Please.

915
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,648
And time will heal it, okay? Trust me.

916
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,766
Time's going to prove that to you.

917
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,565
I want you to just look forward

918
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,485
and be strong.

919
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,460
Time gets rid of a lot of things.

920
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,764
It heals everything.

921
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,082
Let's just get on with doing
what we came here to do.

922
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,164
Let's make a family.

923
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,289
We'll start a new life.

924
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,491
A life of our choosing, without him.

925
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,162
It's really important to not look back.

926
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,245
I don't know.

927
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,849
If everything's stripes,
probably not good.

928
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,928
No, it's cute. No.

929
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,780
Listen, so don't look now,

930
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,123
but there is a creepy guy
watching you from outside.

931
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,484
Yeah. Do you see him? Right there?

932
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,651
Oh, my God.

933
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,121
It's him. It's the guy from before.
The one I told you about.

934
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,644
Well, Robyn, don't...

935
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,140
That is good for the winter.
It's for the stroller.

936
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,380
- It's great.
- Yeah.

937
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,686
It goes with the stroller.

938
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,131
I'm going to take that too.

939
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,605
Take those ones.

940
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,900
- What is this? Is this you?
- I don't mean to interrupt.

941
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,580
Look, Mom, sis,
in case you guys are gone

942
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,900
- before I get back.
- Okay, goodbye.

943
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,500
- Goodbye. Have fun, you guys.
- Bye.

944
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,060
- Bye.
- Don't let Mom drink too much.

945
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,161
Okay.

946
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,260
Hey, sure. You want me to take that?

947
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,522
We'll just write
that it's Joan on there.

948
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,044
This one's from me.

949
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,580
It's just a little something...

950
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,411
There's a bigger present coming.

951
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,604
He's so mean, and now Henry's
a complete tyrant

952
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,361
and Sunny is like a very
sweet law-abiding citizen

953
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,100
who Henry tries to corrupt
at every chance he can get,

954
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,010
which is exactly what Simon did to me.

955
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,460
Really was a bad influence.

956
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:27,044
Hey, Joan, do you remember
a guy called Gordon Mosley?

957
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,640
Gordo?

958
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,487
He was at high school
with you and Simon?

959
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,571
Yeah. Yeah, no, Gordo. He was...

960
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,482
He was the kid that got sent away.

961
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,689
He got sent away? Why?

962
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,082
Man, it was like a million years ago,

963
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,762
but they found him getting molested
in a car by this older kid.

964
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,041
It was really just...
It turned into a huge deal.

965
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,405
They pulled him out of school.

966
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,500
I guess he was getting bullied by the kids
for being gay, the poor thing.

967
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,568
So Simon would have
known all about it, right?

968
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,580
Simon was the one that reported it.

969
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,081
Simon and his friend Greg.

970
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,340
They were the ones that found him.

971
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,169
I think they essentially saved him,

972
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,340
you know, if he was in trouble.

973
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,680
Right.

974
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,260
You could ask him more about it.
I was 12. No one told me anything.

975
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:21,127
But, man, it was a big storm in,
like, a small town, you know?

976
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,641
Robyn?

977
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,960
Hi.

978
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,486
- How'd it go?
- Good.

979
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,380
Good.

980
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,244
My mom get off okay?

981
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,481
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

982
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,491
Great.

983
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,140
You hungry?

984
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,163
Sure. I'll be in in a minute.

985
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,164
"Danny McDonald."

986
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,980
"Mr. Callem, here's all the information
available on Gordon Mosley.

987
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,923
"Put your mind at ease.
This guy is a nobody."

988
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,404
He has a full file on him.
A background check.

989
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,921
"2005, breaking and entering
De Factos' residence.

990
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,765
"Attempted abduction of a minor.

991
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,980
"Discharged from the United States
Military, August 14, 2004."

992
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,500
"Conduct unbecoming.

993
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,460
"Court forced stay in a rehab facility."

994
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,289
Yeah, but Lucy, why was Simon running

995
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,169
a background check without telling me?

996
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,240
Robyn, why don't you just ask him?

997
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,009
Okay, so you can't talk to your husband.

998
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,340
What are you going to do?

999
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,860
I want to find this Greg guy.

1000
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,850
Simon's sister said
he was involved somehow.

1001
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,725
Right.

1002
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,762
Well, maybe you should do
some checking of your own.

1003
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,290
Greg Pierson.

1004
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,324
Mrs. Callem?

1005
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,124
- Yes.
- Ah.

1006
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,610
Right this way.

1007
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,002
Okay. Just relax.

1008
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,002
Uh, I'm sorry.

1009
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,569
I think that you know
my husband, Simon Callem.

1010
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,601
Yeah.

1011
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,690
I came here today 'cause I need
to talk to you about a Gordon Mosley.

1012
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,700
"Simon, just after all these years,

1013
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,540
"I really was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1014
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,780
"I had nothing but good intentions."

1015
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,780
And then there are these.
It's from the Bible.

1016
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,700
"Behold he who conceives mischief
and brings forth falsehood.

1017
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,451
"He has dug a pit and hollowed it out,

1018
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,940
"and has fallen into
the hole which he made."

1019
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,201
I...

1020
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,250
Look, I think he wants to hurt us

1021
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,051
for something that happened back then,

1022
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,285
and I'm just trying to
find out what it was.

1023
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,362
Simon's sister told me that you and him

1024
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,620
stopped Gordo from being molested.

1025
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,131
If you were helping him,

1026
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,660
why would he want to hurt us?

1027
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,300
He wasn't being molested.

1028
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,460
God, this is crazy.

1029
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,140
What do you mean,
he wasn't being molested?

1030
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,820
She told me that he was found
in a car with a...

1031
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,580
I'm sorry, you're just going to have
to talk to your husband about all this.

1032
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,091
I have tried.

1033
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,766
Please.

1034
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,483
Look, can you answer me one question?

1035
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,802
The other person in the car
with Gordo, was it Simon?

1036
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,761
What?

1037
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,926
No, it's...

1038
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,366
No.

1039
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,060
Look, I've made peace with this.

1040
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,700
With Gordo, with what happened
to him, what we did.

1041
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,246
Wait, what you did? But then
you admit that something happened?

1042
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,921
- With what you did.
- No, it was nothing. I mean, he...

1043
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,060
Look, it was nothing,
and then it kind of became something.

1044
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,730
I'm sorry, but you're not
making very much sense.

1045
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,611
- I'm just asking you to tell me...
- It was all a lie.

1046
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,121
What was a lie?

1047
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,366
The whole thing.

1048
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,487
The whole story.
Not one part of it was true.

1049
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,287
Simon made the whole thing up

1050
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,731
about Gordo being with a guy in a car.

1051
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,809
About him being gay.

1052
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,487
But why? Why would he do that?

1053
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,649
'Cause he could.

1054
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,404
Simon was a bully.

1055
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,700
He had a real mean streak,
and Gordo was a target.

1056
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,609
One of the weak kids.

1057
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,650
He made this whole thing up,
and it basically ruined Gordo's life.

1058
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,969
I mean, it's amazing
how an idea can take a hold

1059
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,207
and really bring a person down.

1060
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,322
Look, we were just kids.

1061
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,740
We didn't realize how crazy
this whole thing would get,

1062
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,060
but we did have a chance to stop it.

1063
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,686
Simon could have told the truth,
but he didn't.

1064
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,361
I mean, the bullying,
the kids beating on him,

1065
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,571
and stuff like... I mean,
what happened with Gordo and his dad.

1066
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,365
I don't know what that does to a person.

1067
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,691
What happened with Gordo and his dad?

1068
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,765
We've really got a process going.

1069
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,220
They shouldn't get
the impression that I'm...

1070
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,340
Hey, Robyn.

1071
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,620
...and let them think that I'm...

1072
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,721
Hey, honey.

1073
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,460
You know, I'm passionate
about the job and...

1074
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,721
Yes, I already did that for you.

1075
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,780
The decision's coming down
Monday, all right?

1076
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,201
I've already given my recommendations

1077
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,940
and I don't think you have anything
to worry about, to be honest with you.

1078
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,140
Didn't you mention
that there was another guy?

1079
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,780
A Danny someone?

1080
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,580
Danny McDonald. Did you hear?

1081
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,523
Yes, no, something went down, man.

1082
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,580
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. The guy's being investigated.

1083
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,100
Listen, it's late. Why don't we
pick this up first thing in the morning?

1084
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,820
- I've kept you here long enough.
- Oh, yeah.

1085
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,460
Absolutely. It is late.

1086
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,820
I gotta get out. Robyn, I'm leaving.
Your husband's kicking me out.

1087
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,980
Hey, want to hit balls tomorrow?

1088
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,411
- Yep.
- Yeah?

1089
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,860
You scurry around behind my fucking back

1090
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,980
and you dig up some idiot from my past?

1091
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,620
Just talk to me about it.

1092
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,140
I'm not talking to you about shit

1093
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,287
because it's garbage.

1094
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,900
- Admit that you told a story...
- Stop talking.

1095
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,980
- ...that nearly got someone killed!
- Stop.

1096
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,605
His father tried to kill him.

1097
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,260
Stop! Stop!

1098
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,220
- He tried to burn him.
- Forget it.

1099
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,260
Simon, what you said
affected people's lives.

1100
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,966
His father was arrested
for attempted murder.

1101
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,340
No, his dad knocked him around a little,

1102
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,340
and now it's 25 years later

1103
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,001
and the story's been blown
out of proportion. That's all.

1104
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,806
So you do know.

1105
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,180
Holy shit. I'm an asshole, Robyn, okay?

1106
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,100
I made his life a living hell
and I treated him like shit.

1107
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,220
Is that what you're trying to figure out?
That I was an asshole?

1108
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,926
I was an asshole, okay?

1109
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,940
My dad was an asshole to me,
treated me like shit.

1110
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,060
But I took it. I sucked it up.

1111
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,020
I'm not on my hands and knees
crying about it, praying about it.

1112
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,646
Stuck in the fucking past about it.

1113
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,540
I moved on. I made something of my life.

1114
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,140
This world's about
fucking winners and losers,

1115
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,811
and we're all in the same
shitty playground, you know?

1116
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,720
Guess what? That this guy lost
and then he's moaning about it,

1117
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,300
is just him being stuck
because he wants to be stuck

1118
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,324
because he can't get
past the fucking moment.

1119
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,900
He's not going to pull me back and apologize
for something I don't know about,

1120
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,288
that I'm not responsible for,
that I don't care about.

1121
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,330
I don't owe that guy shit.

1122
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,420
You could say you're
sorry for your part of it.

1123
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,060
Fuck that. People don't apologize
to everyone all the time, Robyn.

1124
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,980
That's not the way the world works.

1125
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,660
Or is that the way it works for you?
Is that what this is about?

1126
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,660
You fantasize about all those girls back
at high school that treated you like shit

1127
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,260
just lining up all of a sudden saying,

1128
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,682
"Hey, Robyn, we're so sorry
about how we treated you..."

1129
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,006
That's great.

1130
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,645
You're a bully.

1131
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,969
You were then, and you still are now.

1132
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,009
I'll take an apology for that.

1133
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,780
Oh, geez, this is not about an apology!

1134
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,723
Simon, this is about you and me!

1135
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,731
You have to do this for us, because if
you don't at least try to fix this...

1136
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,564
If you don't...

1137
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,980
Even if I wanted to,
I have no idea where to find this guy.

1138
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,491
So save it.

1139
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,209
Oh, yes, you do.
You seem to know a lot of things.

1140
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,460
Those Post-its were
stuck to my car window

1141
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,369
soon after he sent that letter,

1142
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,161
and they are the reason that I had
that background check done.

1143
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,888
And then had an attorney contact him

1144
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,170
and get a restraining order.

1145
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,500
I'm sorry. I was trying to protect you.

1146
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,490
I wanted this to be
my burden, not yours.

1147
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,365
I had no idea to what extent
his father hurt him.

1148
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,020
I'd heard stories,
but I did not know to what extent.

1149
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,700
Funny, when someone lies to you enough,

1150
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,929
you just stop
believing anything they say.

1151
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,482
'Cause all this time,
I thought that I was crazy,

1152
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,771
and I'm not.

1153
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,010
And you let me.

1154
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,324
And I just realized

1155
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,083
I have no idea who you really are.

1156
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,566
What can I do to make it up to you?

1157
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,127
You're asking the wrong person.

1158
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,660
Our final question
is a bonus round question.

1159
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,460
Which album was famously
introduced as testimony

1160
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:01,420
in the Tate-LaBianca homicide cases,

1161
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,684
Los Angeles, in 1969?

1162
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,726
Also referred to as the "what" murders?
The "what" murders?

1163
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,445
Hey.

1164
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,880
Gordo.

1165
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,441
Simon.

1166
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,085
How you doing?

1167
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,848
Long time. I saw you up there.
Wanted to say hello.

1168
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,403
Actually, I tracked you down, okay?

1169
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,084
I wanted to apologize.

1170
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:53,089
Robyn and I were talking about things
that happened back at school.

1171
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,610
About how I might not
have treated you so well,

1172
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,286
and she wanted me to bury the hatchet.

1173
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,448
Or as you said, let bygones be bygones.

1174
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,441
And so...

1175
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,049
So she wanted you to come.

1176
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,128
No. Listen.

1177
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,490
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't want to be here.

1178
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,723
So I'm here, and I'm apologizing to you.

1179
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,603
- Well?
- Well, what?

1180
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,043
You accept my apology?

1181
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,203
You see, it's too late for that.

1182
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,811
Got it. Okay.

1183
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,080
You know, I was willing.

1184
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,420
Were you, though?

1185
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,580
Yeah. What the fuck
do you think I'm doing here?

1186
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,365
See, you're done with the past,

1187
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,082
but the past is not done with you.

1188
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,525
What? What do you mean by that?

1189
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,980
It's a saying.

1190
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,060
I know it's a saying,
but what do you mean?

1191
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,400
Hey, I asked you a question.

1192
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,001
Hey!

1193
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,167
I gave you a chance.

1194
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,321
I asked you a question.

1195
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,121
Huh?

1196
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,721
Hey, answer the question.

1197
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,003
Accept my apology.

1198
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,003
I said it's too late for that.

1199
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,524
It's too late for you, Gordo.

1200
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,365
Look at you.

1201
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,565
Now I want you to listen to me.

1202
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,100
I want you to understand something.

1203
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,740
Leave it. Leave it.

1204
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,980
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1205
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,420
Who you are is your own fault.

1206
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,648
It's got nothing to do with me.

1207
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,060
Okay? If you ever come near
me or my family again,

1208
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,140
I will destroy you, you understand?

1209
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,331
How'd it go?

1210
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:31,087
I found him, and...

1211
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,764
What did he say?

1212
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,126
He...

1213
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,284
He just seemed so
appreciative, you know?

1214
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,005
And...

1215
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,445
I'm so sorry.

1216
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,564
I'm really sorry.

1217
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,322
But it's definitely over.

1218
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,051
Thank God.

1219
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,564
I'm so sorry, honey.

1220
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,042
For everything, you know.

1221
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,209
Yeah. Me too.

1222
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,651
Speech!

1223
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,100
Who I would like to say
is my successor...

1224
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,645
- Stand up. Stand up.
- Speech.

1225
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,524
- Speech, Simon. Come on.
- A man who's synonymous

1226
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,604
with hard work, with integrity,

1227
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,890
with just being a kiss-ass,

1228
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,369
but nobody that I can honestly think
of better to fill this position

1229
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,445
and a man I'm very proud to call
a great man and a good friend.

1230
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:14,820
- Orthus' new National Divisions Sales Rep.
- It's all because of you.

1231
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,082
Speech. Speech.

1232
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,860
All credit goes to Kevin.

1233
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,260
Truly, without you
it would not have happened.

1234
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,886
Thank you. Do you hear?
He said, "All credit goes to Kevin."

1235
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,420
And just, you know,

1236
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,820
I'm happy and I love you and I love him

1237
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,580
and love you guys...

1238
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,780
Better speech.

1239
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,881
Oh!

1240
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,100
What the hell was that?

1241
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,020
- Was that a branch? Are you okay?
- It was big.

1242
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,521
Somebody does not want
you to give a speech.

1243
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,083
You just jumped. You jumped so far.

1244
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,204
- I don't know what that was.
- What was that?

1245
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,780
- Was that the glass?
- Careful.

1246
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,041
What the hell?

1247
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,366
Turn the light on.

1248
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,780
- Did it get you?
- No. No.

1249
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,484
- You okay?
- You okay? Call the police.

1250
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,660
- I think that was a rock.
- Holy...

1251
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,020
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1252
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,620
- You guys all right? Hey.
- Is everybody okay?

1253
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,721
Hey.

1254
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,245
Call the police.

1255
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,100
Guys...

1256
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,605
Okay, careful.

1257
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,220
Turn that off.

1258
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,129
It's gone, whatever it was.

1259
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,605
You have to file a report.

1260
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,731
What was it?

1261
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,700
Guys, stay back.
No, guys, stay back, stay back.

1262
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,961
Simon!

1263
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,260
Simon! My God!

1264
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,420
- Stay back!
- Simon!

1265
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,020
- Be careful! Watch out, watch out!
- Stay back.

1266
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,220
- Watch out.
- Guys, stay back, seriously.

1267
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,446
No.

1268
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,729
Jesus! My God.

1269
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,808
- Who the fuck are you?
- Jesus, Danny, what the hell?

1270
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,963
Who the fuck is this guy?

1271
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,740
- Get off!
- Do you know this guy?

1272
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:09,860
Yeah, it's Danny McDonald!

1273
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,860
- Fuck off.
- Guys, guys. I know him.

1274
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,450
- It's Danny McDonald.
- Fuck off!

1275
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,963
Let him go. Come on.

1276
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,900
You're the one
who cheated me out of the job,

1277
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,740
I fucking know it was you, mother...

1278
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,860
Hey, hey, hey.

1279
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,769
Get off me, get off me!

1280
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,371
Hey, hey, hey.

1281
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,740
I saw the e-mail, you asshole!

1282
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,940
Saying you knew people
at my old firm, yeah?

1283
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,500
Who the fuck did you know
at Parker and Fitch?

1284
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,140
You fabricated all that shit, admit it!

1285
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,300
I lost my job because of
you, you lying asshole!

1286
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,402
Who the fuck did you know?

1287
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,206
No, no.

1288
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,890
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey.

1289
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,923
No, no, no.

1290
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,406
Please, come on.

1291
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,001
No, no, I can't get arrested, please.

1292
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,300
It's okay.

1293
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,686
No. No.

1294
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,606
Let him go.

1295
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,603
Go ahead, let him go. Let him go.

1296
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,011
Go ahead.

1297
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,648
I think this is happening.

1298
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,260
Okay. All right, let's go.

1299
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,100
- This is happening.
- Simon?

1300
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,725
- It's happening.
- Get your keys.

1301
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,444
- Is anyone blocking you in?
- Let's go get your bag, okay?

1302
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,607
- Okay.
- You all right?

1303
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,245
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

1304
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,740
Hey, Kevin, how are you?

1305
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,286
Simon, we need to talk. You free?

1306
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,520
Yeah. I've got a second, what's up?

1307
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,220
I was doing him a favor.
This guy had a bad track record.

1308
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,140
Look, Simon, it kills me to be calling you
today of all days, but...

1309
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,620
- Kevin, listen to me.
- ...I just had to warn you.

1310
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,820
They know the stuff
about Danny was fabricated.

1311
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,900
They want your office
cleaned out by the end of the week.

1312
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,740
Jesus, what a fucking mess.

1313
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,780
You know, I went to bat for you.

1314
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,580
Buddy, I gotta call you back.
I hope you understand.

1315
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,900
We're going to work
this out later, okay?

1316
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,890
Save your breath, all right?
This is final.

1317
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,129
I'll call you later.

1318
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,260
With what they're giving me? Sure.

1319
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,580
No problem.
I'm surprised you're still talking now.

1320
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,206
You should go home and get some sleep.

1321
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,140
I'm going to go get you that tea, okay?

1322
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,561
Okay. Thank you, Lucy.

1323
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,569
They're nice people, aren't they?
Lucy and Ron?

1324
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,100
Reminds me, I should
probably go check on Ron.

1325
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,500
See how he's doing with the window.

1326
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,524
Maybe take a shower for the both of us.

1327
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,540
See if Ron's open to taking care
of Jangles for a couple of days.

1328
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,563
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

1329
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,570
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1330
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,561
Call me if you need anything else.

1331
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,980
Simon?

1332
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,161
Hmm?

1333
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,369
I don't... I don't want to go
back to that house.

1334
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,642
God, this isn't easy, Simon.

1335
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,530
Especially now.

1336
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,601
I...

1337
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,523
I don't want to go back
to that house with you.

1338
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,766
You...

1339
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,491
Okay.

1340
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,444
I'm going to hurry back and we'll talk.

1341
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,529
I'll be right back.

1342
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,660
I'll tell you why he
doesn't have a wife.

1343
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,180
He'd like to be married to you.
He'd like you to be his wife.

1344
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,964
- Oh, God, Simon.
- Yep.

1345
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:30,260
Come on, honey. This guy likes you
so much. Tell me you don't see it.

1346
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,420
Come on.

1347
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,249
I really don't think
that is the reason why.

1348
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,060
- Stop.
- Come on, honey.

1349
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:39,802
Why all the drop in's and the stop
by's only when you're home alone?

1350
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,540
I think he's obsessed with you, honey.
I think he wants to nail you.

1351
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,220
I think he wants to be me,
wants to move into the house.

1352
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,740
He wants to play mommies
and daddies with you,

1353
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,330
the creepy little fucker.

1354
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,761
I'm Gordo the Weirdo.

1355
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,371
What?

1356
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,168
...crazy little pee-pee,

1357
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,046
pee-pee pleasey-weasy.

1358
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,209
I'm Gordo the Weirdo
and I want you all to myself.

1359
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,460
- Can I have you?
- No.

1360
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:16,900
Can I have you, please? Why not?

1361
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,540
- Why not?
- Because you're disgusting.

1362
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,646
I came to say...

1363
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,245
Congratulations.

1364
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,923
What happened to you?

1365
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,280
Uh...

1366
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,922
Did Simon do that to you?

1367
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,603
He just...

1368
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,371
I don't know what's going on with him.

1369
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,289
He just went crazy.

1370
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,404
Boy or a girl?

1371
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,050
He's a boy.

1372
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,328
I'm very happy for you.

1373
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,403
Good people deserve good things.

1374
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,403
No. Fuck.

1375
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,404
What did you do?

1376
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,040
Come on, Robyn, pick up the phone.

1377
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,445
Hi, you've reached Robyn.

1378
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,607
I can't get to the phone right now.

1379
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,609
- Please leave a message.
- Shit.

1380
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,688
Robyn?

1381
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,802
Hey! Gordon!

1382
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,446
Hey!

1383
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,900
Hey! Gordon!

1384
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,889
You sick motherfucker!

1385
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,161
Gordo!

1386
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:55,940
Hello?

1387
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,260
Fuck you. Where are you?

1388
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,580
Don't interrupt me.

1389
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:04,260
If you don't mind,
I'm just going to power through this

1390
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,840
and you can talk right after, okay?

1391
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,500
Are you going to tell her, or should I?

1392
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,540
No, no, no. Please. Please. Please.

1393
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,100
- Gordo, listen.
- Please?

1394
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,420
Please?

1395
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,649
Pleasey-weasy, pleasey-weasy,
creepy little fucker.

1396
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,047
Say "pleasey-weasy."
Yeah, "pleasey-weasy." Say it.

1397
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,260
Yeah, you're sweating now.
You know what?

1398
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,820
You know what you really want is,

1399
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,140
what you really want is for me
to tell you that everything's okay.

1400
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,129
That it didn't happen.

1401
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,041
Does it remind you of something?

1402
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,003
You never did that for me.

1403
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,124
Fucking asshole.

1404
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,780
Okay?

1405
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,406
I didn't do it. There.

1406
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,204
I didn't touch her.

1407
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,924
Or maybe I did.

1408
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,980
I don't know.
See, I could tell you the truth.

1409
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,740
Maybe I didn't do it,

1410
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,366
but a liar won't believe
anybody else, right?

1411
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:06,641
I think you just need to go
and have a look at the baby.

1412
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,767
It's all in the eyes, you see.

1413
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,780
You see what happens when you poison

1414
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:16,565
other people's minds with ideas?
