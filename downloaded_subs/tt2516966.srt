1
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,808
First I heard screaming,
then a terrible explosion.

2
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,535
Any thoughts?

3
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,447
I thought the power cables
had short-circuited...

4
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,810
...and that the house was burning
with the neighbors inside.

5
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,818
Iran out here to see what had happened...

6
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,815
...but the house was
in perfect condition.

7
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,153
Doctor Canseco...

8
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,858
Doctor?

9
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,618
Is it true that four people are missing?

10
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,197
Were they patients of yours?

11
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,796
What's in the box?

12
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,129
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

13
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,807
- Do you work here?
- Yes.

14
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,819
- What did you see?
- I was asleep and a sound woke me up.

15
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,043
What kind of sound?

16
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,814
It sounded like a train, but we
don't have trains around here.

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,492
Then I heard screaming, I got up
and saw fire near the house.

18
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,850
What can you tell me about the tenants?

19
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,957
They recently moved in.
Just married, good people.

20
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,526
I think someone was following them.
They looked scared.

21
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,329
They always had a camera with them,
as if they were investigating something.

22
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,537
Good morning.

23
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,942
- Good morning?
- Good morning.

24
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,558
- Do you want some cereal?
- Yes, please.

25
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,445
And the spoons?

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,437
Happy birthday, Mrs.

27
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,810
- Oh, you're mean.
- Come here.

28
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,203
Thank you.

29
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,515
SQ?

30
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,310
Do you like it?

31
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,785
- Why are you combing your hair for?
- Look over there.

32
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,759
What?

33
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,130
What is it?

34
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,935
What's so funny?

35
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,801
- I already have a name for it.
- Let's hear it.

36
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,171
Carlo.

37
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,313
- The worst of it all is that I like it.
- Of course you do.

38
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,812
It's actually not negotiable.
It has already learned it.

39
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,815
Very well. Carlo.

40
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,823
Do you want to see what
my students gave me?

41
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,451
- Can you hold this?
- Yes.

42
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,522
How about it?

43
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,433
It's nice.

44
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,402
It's pretty.

45
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,471
I have to show you what
they wrote to me.

46
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,635
Let's see it.

47
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,807
Oh, the film is running ou-

48
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,639
All right, let's do this.

49
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,817
- Ready?
- Ready.

50
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,652
They're eight years old, okay?

51
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,821
Besides, I want you to see who wrote it.

52
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,020
All right.

53
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:43,856
Miss Altair...
sun of my moon, sun of my love.

54
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,997
You are a heart that beats.
You are an angel to me.

55
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,803
I can fight like you,
and I know you'd fight for me.

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,004
Happy birthday, from Carlo.

57
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,441
- Manuel!
- What?

58
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,478
I'm testing the audio.

59
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,317
Altair?

60
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,827
Are you filming this?

61
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,963
Aha.

62
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,301
It's beautiful.

63
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,950
What's going on?

64
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,984
Wow.

65
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,200
What time are you going to get here?

66
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,434
Friends of Manuel, friends of mine.

67
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,446
At nine o'clock, but you can come earlier.

68
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,877
Come on, at least for a while.

69
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,184
Te re, it's Friday.

70
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,789
Don't be ridiculous, you'll only
be out for a couple of hours.

71
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,855
I'll be waiting for you.

72
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,428
No. I'll see you here.

73
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,668
Ciao.

74
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,808
Tell him to stop recording me, Carlo.

75
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,883
If only you could see what I see.

76
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,848
Turn that thing off, Manuel.

77
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,824
- Manuel, I'm serious.
- Ok, fine.

78
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:59,285
I'm really testing the audio,
but I'll turn it off on one condition.

79
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,356
Aha?

80
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,360
Put on your flight attendant costume.

81
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,034
Come on.

82
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,304
Come on.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,446
Why are you hiding?

84
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,439
What?

85
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,116
My God.

86
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,820
Hello?

87
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,849
Hello?

88
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,882
Hello!

89
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,790
Who is it?

90
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,802
Let me hear.

91
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,443
Hello?

92
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,886
- Can you help me with the terrace?
- Anything the birthday girl wants.

93
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,884
What do you need?

94
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:04,489
Rake the leaves, clean the garage,
turn on the lights, take out the trash.

95
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,493
Make it look good.

96
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,431
Done.

97
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,137
All right, just like we rehearsed.
Three, two, one...

98
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,280
Smooth.

99
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,815
Yeah, smooth.

100
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,016
Weed, nice!

101
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,123
No, no, no! Don't!

102
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,949
Mauricio Garces.

103
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,985
His babe.

104
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:41,864
Couple number one.

105
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,933
Couple number two.

106
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,674
The birthday girl...

107
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,635
...and Manuel.

108
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,442
Very nice.

109
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,644
Tssssss.

110
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,166
Hi. I'm Callahan.

111
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,799
Do you know what a steak
sounds like when it's cooked?

112
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,301
Tssssss.

113
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,374
Good one, right?

114
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,213
Callahan, stop recording and come over here.

115
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,387
Someone has to do
the dirty work, Manuel.

116
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,187
Callahan, get over here.
We're talking about Bergman.

117
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,922
Mmm, nah.

118
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,366
So, Tere is coming?

119
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,437
Your sister is coming?

120
00:09:58,998 --> 00:09:59,976
What?

121
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,975
Supposedly, yes.

122
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,511
- She's coming with Bergman.
- Does she know I'm here?

123
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,945
What are you laughing about?

124
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,021
Let me call her.

125
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,289
Geez, my friend.

126
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:14,177
The captain and his crew would like
to welcome you aboard this flight.

127
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,944
Estimated time to our destination
is around one hour.

128
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,814
Don't stop, don't stop.

129
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:26,163
For your safety, the use of cameras
will not be allowed during our flight.

130
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,289
No...

131
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,488
No...

132
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:34,294
And they should be turned off
until we reach our destination.

133
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,468
We will experience turbulence,
you have been warned.

134
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:45,344
So please don't disturb the captain,
nor me.

135
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,193
I wasn't dreaming.

136
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,799
I'm telling you it was real.

137
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,931
He was in front of the bed.

138
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,138
Did he talk to you?

139
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,311
Yes.

140
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,040
What did he say?

141
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,853
He said he was an angel.

142
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,429
You're going to laugh
when you see this.

143
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,257
See? You haven't seen it and
you're laughing already.

144
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,834
I'm not laughing, Manuel.

145
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,801
I know when I'm dreaming, and when I'm not.

146
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,799
I'll be fine in a moment.

147
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,808
But what about last night?

148
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:55,317
Do you remember us doing
the Russian trampoline?

149
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:57,981
No?

150
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,121
What about the Chinese butcher?

151
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,257
Feeling better?

152
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,827
What was that?

153
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,839
- Did you find anything?
- No.

154
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,183
What?

155
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,010
No.

156
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,820
Just this.

157
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,964
Such a hard worker!

158
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,967
What do you think?

159
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,970
I love it.

160
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,511
I can't wait, I want to see it.

161
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,837
Carlo...

162
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,149
Stop it.

163
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,314
- Hey!
- Carlo!

164
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,189
What do you want for dinner?

165
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,327
Papaya.

166
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,296
We don't have any.

167
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,958
You don't even like it, you liar.

168
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,198
Go buy some, I'll prepare it if you want.

169
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,435
I can see one from down here.

170
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,640
You're gross!

171
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,498
Stop it!

172
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,339
By the way, did you keep
having weird dreams?

173
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,847
No, not anymore.

174
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,040
How's your project going?

175
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,340
It's going well.

176
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,151
How long will it take to finish?

177
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,047
About four months.

178
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,084
What's with that"?

179
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,330
I already told you this
one would take longer.

180
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,298
No, I mean the doll... the Pinocchio.

181
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,491
It was already there, on the table.

182
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,797
It's not yours?

183
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,532
No.

184
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,670
Then, who knows?

185
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,843
What do you mean?

186
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,205
Me neither.

187
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,812
So?

188
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,847
- So what?
- So where did it come from, Manuel?

189
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,452
I don't know.

190
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,880
Hold on. Careful.

191
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,848
Lean forward. Hold it tightly.

192
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,159
Above the nose.

193
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,592
Hold it right there.

194
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,800
I brought you something.

195
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,463
- Call Carlo.
- Mmh?

196
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,467
- I said... call Carlo.
- Why?

197
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,640
Just call him, you'll see.

198
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,378
Carlo!

199
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,149
Look at it's cute face!

200
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,820
- Ugh, why did you paint his face?
- No, I didn't paint it.

201
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,324
Carlo, Carlo?

202
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,391
Where are you going?

203
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,797
I hope it's not what I think it is.

204
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:03,426
- Carlo! God damn it!
- What happened?

205
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,164
- Come here!
- Manuel!

206
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,804
Don't mess with my work.
Do you understand?

207
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,504
- Not with my work!
- Manuel.

208
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,839
It ruined my day's work, Altair!
I told you not to let him go near the living room.

209
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,819
You're sleeping outside.

210
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,322
Stop whining you little son of a bitch.

211
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,924
Al?

212
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,493
Altair?

213
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,305
What?

214
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,874
Are you hearing this?

215
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,533
What?

216
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,945
Come here.

217
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,529
What is that?

218
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,255
I don't know.

219
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,303
Altair.

220
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,873
Altair!

221
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,145
What are you doing?

222
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,821
Come to bed.

223
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,824
Are you having strange dreams again?

224
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,159
Did you see the angel, again?

225
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,925
Altair.

226
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,503
Good morning.

227
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,819
What are you looking at?

228
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,372
Is everything okay?

229
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,177
Altair?

230
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,010
Yes Manuel, every-thing's fine.

231
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,454
Aren't you running late?

232
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,957
I'll be out in a moment.

233
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,954
Why did you lock the door?

234
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,867
Carlo?

235
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,840
Carlo?

236
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,150
Carlo?

237
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,837
What is this?

238
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,264
What are you doing?

239
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,330
Altair.

240
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:08,377
I hate it when you don't answer.
What are you doing?

241
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,515
Help me paint these, will you?

242
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,809
Okay...

243
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,517
...what are we painting them for?

244
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,288
Just help me.

245
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,052
Are they for school?

246
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,295
Are there any more boxes?

247
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,792
What?

248
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,623
- Are there any more boxes?
- No.

249
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,928
So you did order them?

250
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,935
Altair!

251
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,656
What are you doing?

252
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,001
I'm talking to you!

253
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,326
No, they are not for school...

254
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,807
...and no, I didn't order them.

255
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,845
I'm just doing what they asked me to do.

256
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,942
Who's 'they'?

257
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,849
The angels, Manuel.

258
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,814
The angels?

259
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,017
The angels told you to
paint the bricks black?

260
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,027
Yes, I know what you're going
to say and I don't care.

261
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,262
But yes.

262
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,160
They were here last night.

263
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,360
They told me I was chosen to help them.

264
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,978
That all I needed to do was to build a door of black
bricks in my room, and another one in the basement.

265
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:54,511
You're picking me up from school and tell me some
boxes with bricks and black paint arrived to the house.

266
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,387
What's wrong with you?

267
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,517
Tell me.

268
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,529
What's the matter?

269
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,938
- You don't get it, do you?
- What?

270
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,641
You don't understand anything at all.

271
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,954
Hello?

272
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,987
Hello!

273
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,037
I can't sleep.

274
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,816
I can't find Carlo.

275
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,430
Carlo?

276
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:18,926
Carlo, Carlo!

277
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,175
Carlo!

278
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,817
Way to go, Manuel.
Way to go.

279
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,382
What were you thinking?

280
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,796
Carlo?

281
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,170
Carlo?

282
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,949
What the fuck is this?

283
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,467
Hey!

284
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,514
What are you doing here?

285
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:46,881
Al?

286
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,290
Altair?

287
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,793
Altair?

288
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,499
Altair?

289
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,659
What are you doing... Altair?

290
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,993
Altair, I'm talking to you!

291
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,501
Altair?

292
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,945
Altair?

293
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,380
Altair?

294
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:28,821
Alta...

295
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,259
Can we talk now?

296
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,263
Altair.

297
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,275
Can you tell me what this is?

298
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,044
Do you remember what happened last night?

299
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:02,547
Were you asleep?

300
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,549
Altair.

301
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,856
You talk too much, Manuel.

302
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,266
...llahan.

303
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,827
I need you to come over.

304
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,466
Okay, at what time do...

305
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,444
Callahan.

306
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,390
- I'm ready.
- Thanks for coming.

307
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,991
- Where's Altair?
- At school.

308
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,865
So, she...

309
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,135
...had a dream about... angels?

310
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,998
And minutes later birds fell from the sky?

311
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:54,543
And your dog is missing.
And you haven't found him?

312
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,806
I'll need to see everything you've recorded.

313
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,381
- And I mean everything!
- Yes.

314
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,617
Okay.

315
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,322
Then, a load of bricks arrived, right?

316
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:12,792
Bricks that you didn't order, and neither did Altair.

317
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,022
Yeah.

318
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,927
It's easy, Manuel.

319
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,368
We have a stalker, stalking us.

320
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,170
This is one of them.

321
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,379
And this is the other one.

322
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:39,288
What the fuck is this, Manuel?

323
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,160
Hey!

324
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,637
Where are the rest of the film rolls?

325
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,538
Right here...

326
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,377
...and over here.

327
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,812
There are more on the way.

328
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:15,814
Should I save some for your clay models?

329
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,326
No.

330
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,794
- What about Carlo?
- Nothing yet.

331
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,357
Hey...

332
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,773
The idea is for you to film the interesting
parts, not literally everything.

333
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,434
Yeah, right?

334
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,504
Good evening?

335
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,145
Hello?

336
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,017
Who the fuck calls at this hour...

337
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,790
...and then say nothing.

338
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,685
Hello?

339
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,383
What's that?

340
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,856
It's my magic cube.

341
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,855
That doesn't answer my question.

342
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,357
A real traveller would know.

343
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,799
Ever been to Budapest?

344
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,304
No.

345
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,041
Then I'm afraid I can't tell you.

346
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,197
Mmm.

347
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,939
All right, I'm going out for a while.

348
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,179
Okay. Where are you going?

349
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,378
Te re's house.

350
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,820
- Hi.
- Hello.

351
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,054
Hi Tere!

352
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,916
How is my sister doing?

353
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,631
- What about Altair?
- She's at school.

354
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,800
So, let me start.

355
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:26,040
I'm discovering a side of Altair
that I didn't know before.

356
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,814
The lively woman I married to is now...

357
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:35,650
...serious, apathic and bitter.

358
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:42,261
She doesn't want me to talk to her,
come close, or even touch her.

359
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:50,637
You are her sister.
You know her better than I do.

360
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,936
Is there anything I should know?
Was she... is she like this?

361
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,508
Anything?

362
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:02,147
Manuel I respect you, and I love my
sister... but your problems are yours.

363
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,152
You're on your own.

364
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,119
Okay-

365
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,520
Okay, I see now.

366
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,494
Thanks anyway.

367
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,823
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- What about the angels?

368
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:20,802
Altair says she talks to...

369
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,037
Let's go out. Where should we go?

370
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,502
I'm fine here.

371
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,008
Let's go to the movies.

372
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,202
You can...

373
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,017
...choose whatever movie you like.

374
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,549
I'm fine here.

375
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,447
- Are you sure?
- I said I'm fine!

376
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,267
Is this what you heard in your room?

377
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:35,542
It's 4:00 AM.

378
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,814
I heard the sound again.

379
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,813
It woke me up and
I can't go back to sleep.

380
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,381
I almost finished solving my magic cube.

381
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:52,520
I've been thinking of removing the
fucking stickers so I can finish it now.

382
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:57,525
My photo camera ran out of film and...

383
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,530
...everyone is acting strange in this house.

384
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,266
Except me.

385
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,309
The sofa I'm sleeping in is...

386
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,812
...very comfortable.

387
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,816
But that doesn't help because...

388
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,049
...I'm not sleepy.

389
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,941
Where the fuck did...?

390
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,157
Altair?

391
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:16,804
Altair?

392
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,851
Altair.

393
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,119
Fucking Manuel!

394
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,916
Fuck Manuel for bringing me here...

395
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,254
...to help him out with his bullshit investigation!

396
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,271
And I'm keeping your camera
because you're both assholes.

397
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,842
That's right.

398
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,022
...you're going home.

399
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,816
You're going to smoke a doobie.

400
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,788
You'll go to the cinema tomorrow.

401
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,192
You'll watch Hitchcock's new film.

402
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,153
And everything will be fine.

403
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,499
Everything will be all right, don't panic.

404
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,301
These fucking roads are a mess.

405
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,366
What's wrong with that crazy bitch?

406
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:05,505
Nobody laughs at me!
I'm the friend who came to help!

407
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,510
Fuck this shit.

408
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,051
What the...?

409
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,951
No fucking way.

410
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,275
Oh, no.

411
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,938
No, no, no.

412
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,317
There's no way I'm going back.

413
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,841
No. No. No.

414
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,822
I refuse. No!

415
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,029
Manuel.

416
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,958
Manuel!

417
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,838
I want to show you something.

418
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:07,041
- What time is it?
- Who cares? Get over here.

419
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,141
Look what I found.

420
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,186
What the fuck is this?

421
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,114
What do you mean?
It's Carlo.

422
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:25,258
That's not Carlo.
Carlo is two months old and this one is not.

423
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:26,921
Carlo?

424
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,627
See?

425
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,605
And I have to talk to you about something else.

426
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,652
Look at this Carlo, look.

427
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,792
- Carlo?
- What are you doing?

428
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,797
Nothing, we're just playing around.

429
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,474
Carlo.

430
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,176
What happened to you, Carlo?

431
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,005
I think he might have giantism.

432
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,840
What? Didn't you see that movie...

433
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,321
...The Giant Constantin?

434
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,221
Giantism.

435
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,190
Hello?

436
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,930
Hello?

437
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:51,878
Hello?

438
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,845
Is that the stalker?

439
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:55,844
Hello!

440
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,812
Listen to me motherfucker... I don't
know who you are, but I will find out.

441
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,302
- Hello?
- Manuel, this is Tere. Can you talk?

442
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,342
Yes.

443
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,205
Can you come over? Right now?

444
00:43:58,536 --> 00:43:59,810
Yeah, sure.

445
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,839
- It's urgent, Manuel.
- We're on our way.

446
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,684
- I'll see you here.
- Thank you, Tere.

447
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,161
Is that the radio?

448
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,212
Hold this for me.

449
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,041
May I?

450
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,249
Manuel...

451
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,661
...the doll.

452
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,298
Who is he?

453
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:03,300
He's our brother.

454
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,040
What?

455
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,433
What does this have to do
with everything I've told you?

456
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,172
And how come I didn't know
my wife had a brother?

457
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:23,083
My parents gave us the news.

458
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,365
Altair had been asking for a little
brother since her first words.

459
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,793
After birth...

460
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,800
...we found out he was a boy.

461
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,177
Pablo.

462
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:47,175
Altair played with him all the time.

463
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:54,820
She would change his diapers, and
help my mom bathe him and feed him.

464
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:03,523
Until Altair's sixth birthday.

465
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,429
That day...

466
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:14,539
...she enjoyed her party, opened up
her presents and went to sleep.

467
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,317
She suddenly woke up...

468
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:27,186
...screaming, saying Pablo
had been taken away.

469
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:30,516
My parents told her that...

470
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,794
...Pablo was asleep in his cradle.

471
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:38,625
We all went into the room,
looked into the cradle and...

472
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:44,102
...the cradle was empty.

473
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,833
We searched for him...

474
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,645
...and searched...

475
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:55,284
...and searched.

476
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:02,886
For some reason, my parents decided...

477
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:07,823
...that Altair should be
taken to a psychoanalyst.

478
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:16,035
My father approached to me...

479
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,804
...and said...

480
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:22,934
For the sake of your sister,
I'm going to ask you...

481
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,209
...to never...

482
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,615
...ever talk about Pablo again.

483
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,753
Did they ever find out who took him?

484
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,439
What did she dream about?

485
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,035
Tere...

486
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:04,817
What did Altair dream about?

487
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:20,994
What?

488
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,503
What is that?

489
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,302
I don't know, but let me get it
out of the fucking way.

490
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,825
What is it?

491
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,626
Manuel?

492
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,535
Altair?

493
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,935
Altair?

494
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,149
Altair?

495
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,498
Manuel!

496
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,305
Manuel!

497
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,266
Altair?

498
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,259
You never go to work, don't do this to me!

499
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,818
- I have to go today.
- It's okay if you don't go.

500
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,299
- I'll get fired.
- Then come work with me!

501
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,523
- No.
- Callahan!

502
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:08,034
Listen, Manuel!
This shit is bad.

503
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,798
You asked me to come help you,
but you don't let me.

504
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,830
So, I'm leaving.
I'm telling you, she is possessed.

505
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:16,505
- She is not possessed.
- That's because you haven't watched the movie.

506
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,808
I'm telling you... she is possessed.

507
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,945
I know about these things.
If you don't hire an exorcist, I'm leaving.

508
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:25,180
- Callahan, that's bullshit!
- You won't understand until you watch the movie!

509
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:29,484
No. I'm not watching any fucking film.
And we're not bringing a priest in here.

510
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,856
And you are not going anywhere,
you are staying with me.

511
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:34,787
Stay.

512
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,996
Please.

513
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:48,270
Dr. Canseco, thanks for coming.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

514
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,107
- Where is she?
- Good evening.

515
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,340
In the kitchen, I haven't moved her since...

516
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,145
Altair.

517
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,819
Do you remember me?

518
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,653
Altair.

519
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,953
Do you recognize my voice?

520
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:12,429
Do you recognize my voice, Altair?

521
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:20,433
Tere, get close to your sister please.

522
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:30,311
Place her left hand over the table.

523
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,501
Do the same with her right hand.

524
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:04,543
Place her left hand with her palm facing upward.

525
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:16,964
- That is all for today.
- What do you mean?

526
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:18,860
How do I...

527
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,528
Is she going to stay like that
all night long or what?

528
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:26,938
Tell me five symptoms of a cataleptic disorder.

529
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:30,112
- Eh?
- Eh?

530
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:36,341
I'm going to say this nicely...
Don't ever question my methods again, young man.

531
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,818
And we have to wait a whole
week until you come back?

532
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:43,083
No. I'll come back tomorrow.

533
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:48,521
I'm going to do my job.
You do yours.

534
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:53,928
Your job is to take care of her.
Are we clear?

535
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,468
Yes we are.

536
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,046
What is that?

537
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,522
What is it?

538
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,799
Altair?

539
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:06,540
Altair?

540
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:31,461
Altair?

541
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:36,526
Altair?

542
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:39,171
Altair?

543
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:41,267
Altair?

544
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:19,870
Altair?

545
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,285
No!

546
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,488
Get off me!

547
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,586
Altair!

548
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,531
No! No!

549
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,301
No!

550
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:12,159
I don't want them to come anymore.

551
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:18,094
I don't want to dream
about them again.

552
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:30,975
They took me to a horrible place.

553
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,417
It was dark.

554
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:51,629
There was a bed in
the middle of the room.

555
00:59:56,827 --> 01:00:02,175
They said God wanted
to have a child with me.

556
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,976
That I shouldn't be afraid.

557
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:18,019
One of them...

558
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:25,128
...walked towards me and put
his face right in front of mine.

559
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:32,203
The others kept staring at me.

560
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:38,946
But I couldn't do anything.

561
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,507
I couldn't scream.

562
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,353
He put his hand on my forehead...

563
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:57,931
...and his fingers on my face.

564
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,103
He closed my eyes...

565
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:11,877
...and he took my clothes off.

566
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:20,054
...and he...

567
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:32,028
Hello?

568
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,832
Manuel...

569
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,334
What's wrong?

570
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,307
They're calling from Altair's school.

571
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:41,999
Manuel...

572
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,109
Can you tell this woman
that Altair won't be going?

573
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,178
Tell her she is sick or something.

574
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,981
Tere, don't say anything about this. Please.

575
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:57,154
Yes, of course.

576
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,418
Hello?

577
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:03,797
- Manuel...
- Good morning, I'm Tere, Altair's sister.

578
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:10,270
- Yes, I'm sorry... Altair has been very sick.
- Altair?

579
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,803
Altair?

580
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,800
Altair!

581
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,434
This goes completely against my work ethics.

582
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,828
What I am about to give you,
is for you and only you.

583
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:52,940
If you don't comply, there will be
severe consequences for all of us.

584
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:54,474
Is that clear?

585
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,208
Yes.

586
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:58,384
What is it?

587
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:01,886
I don't think you understand.

588
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:05,483
- I repeat. Is it clear?
- Yes, it's clear.

589
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:10,264
I know people who's job is
erasing this kind of material.

590
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,163
Okay. Can you tell me what it is?

591
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:14,631
No.

592
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,996
But I can tell you two things.

593
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:21,974
Your wife's situation is completely
beyond my control.

594
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,033
And also...

595
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:28,312
...shut off that camera immediately,
and hand me the film roll.

596
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:37,324
Aren't you going to open it?

597
01:03:57,067 --> 01:04:00,344
There's another one beside me.

598
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,111
How did he enter your room?

599
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:07,116
His face is right in front of mine.

600
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,288
He's an angel.

601
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:13,454
An angel?

602
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,260
And what does the angel say to you?

603
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:20,258
There are many of them around me.

604
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,467
They are staring at me.

605
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,303
Did you invite them?

606
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:29,606
Did you invite them, Altair?

607
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:33,510
They want to take Pablo with them.

608
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,109
They want to take your brother?

609
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:39,445
- Yes.
- Where?

610
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:43,082
Where do they want to take him, Altair?

611
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,418
To heaven.

612
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,592
Why do they want to take him?

613
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:55,367
They promised they will come back.

614
01:04:57,327 --> 01:05:00,536
Did they tell you what's going to happen?

615
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:04,542
Are they going to bring Pablo back, Altair?

616
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:08,179
They don't let me... remember.

617
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:10,981
Ask them for permission.

618
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:15,012
Why did they take your brother, Altair?

619
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:19,418
They want to play with him.

620
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:24,792
They want to play with him?
What do they want to play?

621
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,659
No.

622
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:31,596
What do they want to play?

623
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:36,637
They want to play with me.

624
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:45,315
They also want to play with her,
and with him, and him.

625
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:51,783
- They want to play with the four of us.
- Which four?

626
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:57,186
Altair, which four do they want to play with?

627
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,316
She's throwing up.

628
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,297
Give me your hands.

629
01:06:38,862 --> 01:06:40,933
We're leaving, okay?

630
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,178
I'm going to carry you.

631
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,046
I need you to help me.

632
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,757
- Don't answer the phone!
- Why not?

633
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,623
We're leaving. Get the door.

634
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,433
- Callahan, get the car keys.
- Where are we going?

635
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:10,967
We're leaving.

636
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:44,793
Open the door! Open it!

637
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,358
Callahan, turn on the camera light!

638
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:23,803
Callahan?

639
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,439
Callahan, turn on the light!

640
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,303
All right, all right.

641
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,291
What was that?

642
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,497
Altair?

643
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:57,527
What is that?

644
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,534
What was that?

645
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,973
It's the bricks.
It's the fucking bricks!

646
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,010
What? No! No!

647
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:16,014
Manuel!

648
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:18,786
Manuel!

649
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,291
No! No! Tere!
Let go of her!

650
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,427
Get off me! Get off me!

651
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:26,596
Altair!

652
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:20,964
Altair?

653
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,812
Altair?

654
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,652
What do I do? What do I do?

655
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,299
What do I do?

656
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:54,328
What do I do?

657
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:03,470
Altair.

658
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:11,544
Altair!

659
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:20,827
Let's go! Let's get out of here!

660
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,860
Listen to me, Altair!

661
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:28,494
Altair?

662
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,607
Altair?

663
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:48,017
Altair?

664
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:52,292
No!

665
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:53,086
No!

666
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:53,859
No!

667
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:58,532
No!

668
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:09,170
Altair, what are you doing?

669
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,374
What are you doing?

670
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,805
What are you doing?

671
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,285
Let it go...

672
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:22,288
Let it go...

673
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:47,475
What are you doing?

674
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:56,956
Oh God.

675
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,308
Manuel?

676
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:23,883
<i>Tare?</i>

677
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:34,817
Manuel?

678
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:36,486
Manuel!

679
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,975
Where are you?

680
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,983
Where are you?

681
01:17:57,907 --> 01:18:00,012
Where are you?
