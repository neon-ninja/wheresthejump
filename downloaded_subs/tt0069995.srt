1
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:34,722
DON'T LOOK NOW

2
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:34,007
Action Man patrol, open fire!

3
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:40,087
This is your Commander speaking.

4
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:48,248
Mortar attack, dig in!

5
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:50,454
What are you reading?

6
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:55,174
I'm trying to answer Christine's
question: If the world is round,

7
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,774
why is a frozen pond flat?

8
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,095
That's a good question.

9
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:38,618
"Lake Ontario
curves more than 3 degrees from its

10
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:42,538
east to its west shore".
Frozen water isn't flat!

11
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:46,259
Nothing is what it seems.
- My cigarettes...

12
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,699
Did you put the slides together?

13
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,020
No, I put the duplicates in my tray.

14
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,261
Action Man patrol, fall in.

15
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:14,581
Enemy in sight. Range one thousand.

16
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:25,142
Oh shit!

17
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,505
What's the matter?

18
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,825
Nothing.

19
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,867
Dad!

20
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:30,398
Everything is rotten.

21
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,959
The stone is like tobacco.

22
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,359
Should I carry on?

23
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:40,239
No. It's already late.
Let's call it a day.

24
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,400
My wife's waiting for me.

25
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,119
See you tomorrow at San Nicola.
- Yeah, exactly.

26
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,520
Thanks a lot!

27
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:02,002
Ciao!

28
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,723
Hi!
- Hi.

29
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:32,364
What are you doing?
- Writing to Johnny. - What?

30
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,764
Just a letter. How'd it go?

31
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:40,205
The deeper we go, the more Byzantine.
I'm restoring a fake.

32
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,685
And you can't change course?
- They haven't enough bread.

33
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:48,205
The options are restore the fake
or let it sink in the sea.

34
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:54,126
What did you say?
- I said, "Daddy's still hard at work

35
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,966
on the windows of St. Nicholas,
our 16th century church.

36
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:01,367
His repairs
are no different than the originals.

37
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,286
I'll send you slides,
maybe you can tell. Hope Ellies

38
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:10,127
is more reasonable this term.
I think that's his Captain.

39
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:15,168
"I'm enclosing the money
for your gym shoes. Buy the ones

40
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:19,168
with the padded soles."
Another boring letter.

41
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:22,089
God, it's cold.

42
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,169
I've got something in my eye.

43
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:43,050
Do you want me to add something?
- Why not send him a card yourself?

44
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,370
It's so cold in here and
the waiters won't come. Hello!

45
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:59,612
I must take some time off.

46
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:02,332
Signori?

47
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:07,132
What do you want?
- I'll have what I had last night.

48
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:11,373
Pollo sopresso, scampi al ferri,

49
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:16,973
vino bianco, due insalate verdi...
Good, that's it.

50
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,574
Did you see the bishop today?
- No.

51
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:22,893
I'm terribly sorry!

52
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:24,534
Sorry.

53
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:31,014
What?
- No, she's got something in her eye.

54
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:39,056
I think I'd better go help them.

55
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:43,575
Perhaps I can show you where it is.
- Oh, it's awfully kind of you.

56
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:08,938
I hope you don't think us rude.

57
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,418
Rude? Why?

58
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,778
Staring at you out there.

59
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:16,859
Comes from the country.
Country people always stare more.

60
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:21,178
I'm frightfully sorry.
- I didn't notice it even if you were.

61
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,659
Which eye is it?
- The left one.

62
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:26,939
Well, let me help.
- Help! - I can try.

63
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,580
No!
You nearly put Jocelyn's eye out

64
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,340
the last time you tried poking about.

65
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,221
Perhaps...

66
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,340
...perhaps I can help?

67
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
That's awfully kind.

68
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,421
Oh dear.

69
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,381
My sister is blind you see.

70
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:52,062
I see.
- Yes.

71
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:34,546
That's it. It was a tiny

72
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:39,585
black speck. I think I've got it.
- Well done.

73
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,226
Thank you very much. Goodness.

74
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,546
You do remind me of my daughter.

75
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:49,427
Really?
- Only her hair is darker.

76
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,147
Your handkerchief.

77
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:58,547
You're sad...
and there's no need to be!

78
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:02,988
My sister's psychic.
- She wants you to know...

79
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:07,748
I've seen her and she
wants you to know that she's happy.

80
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:12,469
I've seen your little girl
sitting between you and your husband

81
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,189
and she was laughing!

82
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,709
Yes,

83
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,949
she was with you!

84
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,150
And she's laughing!

85
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,550
I'm sorry if we stared.

86
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:33,470
She's wearing a shiny little mac.

87
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,351
Christine!

88
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,751
But she's laughing!

89
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,151
She's happy as can be!

90
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:59,232
You're very like her.
The forehead, the eyes...

91
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:04,713
Is that better?
- Yes.

92
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:08,194
Shall I fetch your husband?
- No. I'm alright, thank you.

93
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,194
Jolly good!

94
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,954
Just leave me alone. I'll be fine.

95
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,354
Alright, my dear.

96
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:22,515
Did you

97
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:24,835
really see her?

98
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,916
She was there.

99
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:31,315
She was there!

100
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:48,637
I thought you were right.
I felt you should.

101
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:57,238
Signore.

102
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,480
I sent your food back to be warmed.

103
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,920
The mastic that works it is number 3.
- Oh dear, John, I must stand up.

104
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:03,324
Hey!
- I'm sorry.

105
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:08,604
Signore!
- Thanks.

106
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,285
That's it then.

107
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,729
They're only children here!
- It was the nearest hospital.

108
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,129
I was playing with them.
- The doctor... - John?

109
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,530
Christine is still with us.
- Christine's dead, Laura.

110
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,130
Christine's dead.
- I know, of course!

111
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,851
The two ladies in the restaurant,

112
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,811
they were watching us while we ate.

113
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:26,730
They told me they could see
Christine sitting between us.

114
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:31,371
This is two people we don't even know!
Listen! Listen now!

115
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:35,212
There's one that's blind,
she has the second sight.

116
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:39,412
She described to me
Christine's red plastic mac.

117
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:44,212
Laura...
- John, I'm perfectly alright!

118
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:48,733
I haven't felt as good as this
in months and months!

119
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:54,133
I don't need pills,
I'm not going crazy. I feel great!

120
00:17:55,654 --> 00:18:00,934
When did the doctor say you could go?
- Anytime. I only fainted.

121
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,374
I wish you'd believe me.
I really feel fine.

122
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:08,815
I really feel good at last!
- I believe you!

123
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,655
Seeing is believing.

124
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:16,336
Put your shoes on.

125
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:34,417
Out of the way!
- Stop! Stay there!

126
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:36,938
But I must go through!

127
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:39,618
A homicide occurred here!

128
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:44,137
What's going on?
- A homicide. You must stop.

129
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:50,458
What did he say? Homicide?
- Yeah.

130
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,979
Stop!
- But I must go through!

131
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,140
You can't. Stop now!

132
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,900
What are you doing?

133
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,180
Turn left!

134
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,661
You can't go through here.

135
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:22,941
Isn't this where you were with...
- No.

136
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,142
I want to stop at this church.

137
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:36,823
It's closed. Why that one?

138
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:42,463
I just wanted to...
I want to say a prayer.

139
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:45,823
Oh, Laura!

140
00:19:57,825 --> 00:20:01,304
I don't like this church at all.
- But I do.

141
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,906
Do you have any change?
- Yes.

142
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:15,506
I'm going to light a candle for her.
- How much are candles?

143
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,267
Fifty.

144
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,426
I don't have any fifties.

145
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:23,826
Maybe I'll light six.

146
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:35,868
Thank you, my love.

147
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,031
The Madonna by Antonio Rizzo

148
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:21,991
in about 1490.
The grille work is also by Rizzo.

149
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:24,392
Note the flowers woven into...

150
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:49,835
Jesus!
- You hypocrite!

151
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,475
The bishop!
I'm an hour and a half late!

152
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:55,314
In the name of the Father, the Son,

153
00:21:55,755 --> 00:22:00,515
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
May the mercy and

154
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:03,915
love of our Father
and the peace of the Holy Spirit

155
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,316
be with you.

156
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:26,958
How are you, John?

157
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,918
It was entirely my fault.

158
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,399
It wasn't John's fault.
- A woman to share your sins with.

159
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:35,878
Laura, you're looking better.

160
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:40,438
I'm really terribly sorry.
- It's okay.

161
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,679
These workmen took me around.
We have made some great advances.

162
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,960
I'd like you to look at the mosaics
that need to be refired.

163
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,359
I've already been much too long.
When are you coming to stay with me?

164
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,560
Thursday, if that's alright?
- I look forward to it.

165
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:04,801
I took some samples from the pilings.
We're in trouble down there, too.

166
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:09,961
The churches belong to God, but
he doesn't seem to care about them.

167
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:15,962
Does he have other priorities?

168
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:20,282
We have stopped listening.

169
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,643
Are you a Christian, Laura?

170
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:29,763
I don't know.
I'm kind to animals and children.

171
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:31,683
St. Nicholas

172
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:37,083
of this church is the Patron Saint
of scholars and children. Interesting.

173
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:42,364
We must talk, John!

174
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:46,285
Thursday I'll have your room ready.
- Thank you.

175
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,844
I'll have the mastic samples by then.
Acidity is ruining all the adhesives.

176
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:54,565
I look forward to hearing about it.
Thursday.

177
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:57,925
Ciao.
- Goodbye!

178
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:03,286
He doesn't give an
ecclesiastical fuck about the church.

179
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:08,127
Why did he ask me if I was Christian?
- Because you kissed his ring.

180
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:11,526
What in God's name made you do that?

181
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:16,127
Ciao Giorgio!
- See you tomorrow! - Yes.

182
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:25,448
You know? Your bishop really
makes me feel quite uneasy.

183
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:29,009
He probably makes God
feel less than immaculate.

184
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,168
Signor!
- No.

185
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:35,809
The key!
- I have the key.

186
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:38,849
He has the key!

187
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,130
Be careful! If you ruin it,

188
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,810
I don't know what I'd do!

189
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,530
I'm going
to get down to some work tomorrow.

190
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,571
Enough of this idling around.

191
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:00,491
What?

192
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:10,531
Don't we have to book at this place?
I don't want what happened last time!

193
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:14,212
What place?
- John!

194
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:17,013
The place we're going to be eating at!

195
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:20,013
Yeah, sure.

196
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:24,133
Where is my Neutralgina then?

197
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:34,334
You'll have to read this!

198
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,456
What are you doing?

199
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:49,855
I can't hear what you're saying.
- I'm shouting!

200
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:52,936
I still can't hear.
- What are you doing?

201
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:55,576
I'm having a bath.

202
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:58,816
You heard me that time.

203
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,740
You know those lumps are coming back
on the side of your waist?

204
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,740
See?

205
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:02,022
85 kilos, which is 190 pounds.

206
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:09,702
You okay?
- I'm okay.

207
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:36,985
Come in!

208
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:40,146
May I tidy up?
- Yes, yes.

209
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:46,706
I'll come back later.

210
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:59,947
It's a miracle
I didn't hurt myself when I fainted.

211
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:04,267
The unconscious body reacts faster
than the mind ever can.

212
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,427
Perhaps.

213
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:10,828
You have toothpaste on your mouth.

214
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:18,669
Eat it off!

215
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,029
I can't get it off.

216
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,270
This.

217
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,613
Yes.
- No.

218
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:56,013
Really?
- Yes.

219
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:01,814
You will be eating here tonight,
I hope?

220
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:04,774
No, we're eating out tonight.

221
00:33:05,214 --> 00:33:07,574
Too bad. Have a good night.

222
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:11,454
Thank you.
- Good night.

223
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:16,975
You can to go home.

224
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:40,577
Come here, I think I found the way!
- We went over this bridge already!

225
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:45,218
I never minded being lost in Venice.

226
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:50,937
Now, we take the second left
and then the first left or right.

227
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:53,338
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

228
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:58,298
A nice dark little alley!

229
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:03,379
Yes, this is it.
- It isn't.

230
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,140
Yes, it is.
- It isn't, John.

231
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,539
Come on.
- No, it isn't.

232
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:29,461
Oh, rats! I'm getting out of here.

233
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:35,582
I know this place.

234
00:34:46,704 --> 00:34:48,743
This is it! It's Ponte Giretto!

235
00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:51,023
What?
- Here!

236
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:53,543
- No, I...

237
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:11,305
What's that, John?
- It's okay, I found the real world.

238
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:13,185
Come on.

239
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:23,826
What on earth was that?
- A cat or a rat.

240
00:35:24,307 --> 00:35:27,266
Maybe something else.
- A rat?

241
00:35:35,748 --> 00:35:38,988
This was just around the corner
from where we were!

242
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,388
I know where we are now.

243
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:51,588
Ready?
- Slow!

244
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,110
Slow!

245
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,310
Yeah. Higher.

246
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:14,751
Beautiful. Good.

247
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,553
Ready?
- No!

248
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:40,513
It'll fall down!

249
00:36:43,793 --> 00:36:44,753
Go!

250
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:46,753
Go!

251
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:51,714
Are you ready?

252
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,235
Hello!

253
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,755
Hello!
- Hello!

254
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:11,035
How extraordinary to see you.
Oh, it's Mrs. Baxter.

255
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:14,916
Yes, I know.
- My husband's restoring this church.

256
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:17,876
Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

257
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:22,996
Hold on.
- Yeah.

258
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:25,877
Stop! Wait.
- It's good.

259
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:29,517
Yes, I remember her hair.

260
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,958
Light hair and silky soft.

261
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:36,758
She tossed it as she laughed.
Did she die suddenly?

262
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,358
Heather! You've no right to...
- No, I wouldn't mind talking.

263
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:45,438
I'll just go and get my coat.
Would you mind waiting?

264
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,039
Thanks.

265
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,239
No, no! There!

266
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,440
Yes, there.
- No, there!

267
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,160
Okay.
- Yes!

268
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,480
Hold on!
- Here.

269
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,400
Wait still. Now.

270
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,200
I'll hold it right here.

271
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:10,121
Pull, pull!

272
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:21,121
Sunday afternoon,

273
00:38:21,562 --> 00:38:24,002
we'd just finished lunch.

274
00:38:24,442 --> 00:38:29,402
Before I used to smoke then.
Now, I haven't had a cigarette.

275
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:36,883
John just suddenly got up
and rushed down to the pond, almost

276
00:38:37,324 --> 00:38:40,443
as if he knew
something was going to happen.

277
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:43,363
Yes.
- Well, it was too late. Strange.

278
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:45,884
Yes, of course!
- What?

279
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,964
Of course! He has the gift.

280
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:53,645
That's why the child was trying
to talk to him. He has the gift.

281
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:58,164
Even if he doesn't know it.
Even if he's resisting it.

282
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:02,365
It's a curse as well as a gift.

283
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,526
Wait, there's a knot.

284
00:39:06,966 --> 00:39:08,486
Slow!

285
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:11,246
It's off-center!

286
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:14,127
It never was in the middle.

287
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,646
Over! To the left!
- Okay.

288
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,127
You can't

289
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,807
ever contact people, can you?

290
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:28,288
We're often asked. She's quite famous.

291
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:31,448
They all want a lot of mumbo-jumbo,

292
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:36,608
and holding hands. Second sight
is a gift from the Good Lord.

293
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:39,688
It is impertinent
to call his creatures

294
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,329
back for our entertainment.

295
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:45,409
It wouldn't be for my entertainment.

296
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,210
Would you come for tea?
When your husband's finished?

297
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,130
Just for a little while?

298
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:57,210
I'd like that. Thank you.
That alright?

299
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,210
I make no promises.

300
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:02,931
No.

301
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,331
It's ridiculous!
- They only want to meet you!

302
00:40:07,692 --> 00:40:10,972
I'm not getting involved
in a session of mumbo-jumbo!

303
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:16,331
I've been trying to hang on to myself,
to get rid of this emptiness

304
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:19,852
that's been with me like some pain,

305
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:24,172
and finally through these two women
I've discovered how!

306
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:28,173
They disapprove of mumbo-jumbo, too!
They used that very word.

307
00:40:28,614 --> 00:40:31,974
Of course they do!
- They just want to help!

308
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:36,213
Laura, do you not see...
- She's going to try and reach her.

309
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:50,855
Laura, that's enough.
Now listen to me.

310
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:55,975
I've listened to you. You said let
the children play where they want to.

311
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,895
You let her go near that pond.
- Thanks for the memories.

312
00:41:00,336 --> 00:41:04,576
You said you'd give your life
in exchange for hers. Well you can't.

313
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:07,617
Jesus H. Christ.
- John!

314
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:13,536
She's trying to get in touch with us!
Maybe to forgive!

315
00:41:13,977 --> 00:41:18,937
Go, go on to your crazy women.
They can have their victim.

316
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:38,419
Here, drink this. Whisky.

317
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:42,619
Thank you. I don't really need it.
- You may, child.

318
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,220
I'll be back in a jiffy.

319
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,620
Here you are.

320
00:41:51,181 --> 00:41:54,620
Where are you?
- Me? Oh, I'm here.

321
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,661
Oh, the children.

322
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:02,261
Who are you looking at?

323
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:06,902
There's a boy here
with rolled-up shirtsleeves.

324
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:10,062
Difficult to tell his age.
- Yes, Anthony.

325
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:13,662
And then Charles in his uniform.

326
00:42:14,102 --> 00:42:16,582
Then the three girls.
- Yes.

327
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:19,743
Then there's Angus.
- This little bust?

328
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:23,503
Yes.
- Oh, it's lovely.

329
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:27,504
Yes, he was a gentle child.

330
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:37,544
You haven't touched your drink.
- No.

331
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:40,385
Was that Angus?

332
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:45,625
I was just looking at the pictures
of your family. They're wonderful.

333
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:49,465
It jars you, losing one like that.
But I had two more.

334
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:52,145
So can you, I daresay.

335
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:56,986
Nothing can replace
the one that's gone.

336
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:01,227
Now then...

337
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:06,988
It's alright.

338
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:10,227
It's alright!

339
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,190
Are your legs crossed?

340
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:43,671
Yes.

341
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:04,432
Switch the light out.

342
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:13,238
Yes.

343
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,520
Yes!

344
00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:28,479
Yes!

345
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,080
What are you doing there?
- I'm English.

346
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,161
John! Yes!

347
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:44,960
English.
- What are you doing here?

348
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:51,121
Who are you?
- English.

349
00:45:54,242 --> 00:45:56,642
English.
- What's going on here?

350
00:45:58,603 --> 00:45:59,963
Peeping Tom!

351
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:18,364
What did she say?

352
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:22,364
What did she say?

353
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:27,364
What did she say?

354
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:10,088
I got scared for you.

355
00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:14,889
I told you it was alright.

356
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:24,129
How much have you been drinking?
- You scared for me?

357
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:37,251
You're not going to be sick, are you?
- Screw them!

358
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:41,491
You just got the sniff.
- I am not going to be sick!

359
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:47,891
Alright, John, the blind one,
Heather, she really has second sight.

360
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,092
You'd understand if you'd...

361
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:56,253
Today when I was there, she went
into the most incredible trance.

362
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:59,172
Really...
- Concentrate. - No, John!

363
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:00,813
Yes?

364
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:06,253
She said that your life
is in danger while you're in Venice.

365
00:48:06,694 --> 00:48:11,654
She kept on and on saying that.
- I am going to be sick.

366
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:44,776
I wouldn't go in there
for a couple of minutes if I were you.

367
00:48:45,977 --> 00:48:49,937
I haven't thrown up for ten years.

368
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:51,858
John?

369
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:58,777
I really think we must leave Venice.
It was a warning. It was Christine.

370
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:04,178
She was trying to warn us.
How can I... We must leave!

371
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:08,739
John!
It was Christine, our daughter!

372
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,779
My daughter is dead.
She does not come peeping with

373
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,019
messages back from the fucking grave!
Christine

374
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:20,139
is dead! She is dead, dead, dead!

375
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:40,021
You must think I'm ill then?
- Yes.

376
00:49:46,903 --> 00:49:51,463
If I'm ill,
I should be seeing Dr. Jameson.

377
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:53,103
Yep.

378
00:49:54,063 --> 00:49:59,023
Maybe I am.
Maybe I left England too soon.

379
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:05,544
Maybe...

380
00:50:06,144 --> 00:50:09,384
Maybe
those women were influencing me.

381
00:50:09,825 --> 00:50:13,424
Maybe I shouldn't see them again.
That's what you want, isn't it?

382
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,425
Yeah.

383
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:20,865
Maybe I should take my pills again.

384
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:23,786
On the desk right there. There.

385
00:50:27,746 --> 00:50:28,946
Here.

386
00:50:29,747 --> 00:50:30,947
Here.

387
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:43,387
You...

388
00:50:44,028 --> 00:50:47,988
You could get
a couple of weeks off, couldn't you?

389
00:50:48,988 --> 00:50:50,948
Yeah.
- Could you?

390
00:50:52,988 --> 00:50:54,188
Yes.

391
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:03,349
Do you really think you could, John?

392
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,469
Alright, Laura.

393
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,990
Alright.

394
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:43,193
Hello.
- Hello.

395
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,673
Hello?
- Who on earth is it?

396
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:50,192
Hello. - Hello?
- What time is it, for God's sake?

397
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:51,953
Operator!

398
00:51:52,393 --> 00:51:54,313
Operator!
- What time is it?

399
00:51:54,754 --> 00:51:55,914
Operator!

400
00:51:56,794 --> 00:51:57,994
Hello!

401
00:51:58,434 --> 00:52:01,514
Operator!
Where is this call coming from?

402
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,155
Hello!

403
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:05,915
Hello!

404
00:52:06,355 --> 00:52:10,474
Where in England?
- Hello! Is that Mr. Baxter?

405
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:14,835
John Baxter here.
- Oh, this is Anthony Babbage here.

406
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:18,835
Headmaster, Porton School.
Yes, that's right.

407
00:52:19,276 --> 00:52:22,876
I'm awfully sorry
to get you so late at night...

408
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:25,397
What time is it with you?

409
00:52:25,837 --> 00:52:30,796
Oh, I see. We got your telephone
number from your London people.

410
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:35,877
Yes. There's been
a bit of an accident.

411
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:41,877
It's your son, Johnny. He's been
to the San and he's in capable hands,

412
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:44,278
but Matron thinks...

413
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:47,279
Mr. Baxter? It's Mandy Babbage here.

414
00:52:47,718 --> 00:52:51,478
Yes, poor little Johnny.
It was during fire practice.

415
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,999
There's nothing to worry about.
- Good.

416
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:57,199
Yes.

417
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,920
Tell them I'm on the next plane home.

418
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,280
What was that?

419
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:08,400
My wife will be there this morning.

420
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,320
Yes.
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

421
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:16,281
Yes, goodnight. Good morning.

422
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:19,121
Bye.

423
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:22,881
This is what I meant
about leaving Venice. They were right.

424
00:53:23,922 --> 00:53:26,721
This is it, this is what they meant.

425
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,042
You see?

426
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:35,282
Pronto! Pronto!

427
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:38,283
Allitalia, please.

428
00:53:38,723 --> 00:53:42,683
Get me the airport then.
What time do they open?

429
00:53:43,364 --> 00:53:46,283
Oh, Christ! Thank you. Goodnight.

430
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:50,443
Darling, she said
that she's sure that he'll be okay.

431
00:53:50,884 --> 00:53:54,324
But that is not so! You know that.

432
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:59,004
I won't ask you any more
favors for a year!

433
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:03,605
You'll be doing the right thing
if you do this for me.

434
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:13,085
It's a charter flight, you've got
the last seat. - Fantastic!

435
00:54:13,526 --> 00:54:16,086
He's finding out where they go from.
- John,

436
00:54:16,526 --> 00:54:19,566
don't forget to ask the bishop

437
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,847
about staying over in England.
- Three weeks?

438
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:27,206
Whatever you can do.
I just need time away from this.

439
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:31,687
I'll tell him today.
- You can't come with me now?

440
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:35,248
No. Call tonight.
I'll be there by the weekend.

441
00:54:36,488 --> 00:54:40,768
Her name is Signora Baxter.
How much does it cost?

442
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:42,729
In 10 minutes?

443
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:45,608
In 10 minutes. From Riva Schiavoni?

444
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,609
Thanks. You're a friend.

445
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:53,769
The boat leaves in ten minutes
from Riva Schiavoni.

446
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:58,170
Mr. Baxter!
Yes?

447
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,290
We are closing!

448
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:03,650
I'll collect everything this morning!

449
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:09,450
I can't believe this!

450
00:55:15,372 --> 00:55:20,332
Good morning. I am John Baxter.
- The Hotel told me.

451
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:27,612
Give Johnny my love.

452
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:41,173
I'll call you tonight, okay?

453
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,060
This has great significance!

454
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,620
The Holy Virgin and
the Patriarch of Constantinople.

455
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:58,940
Yes.
- It tells the story...

456
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,340
Beautiful work.
- Thank you.

457
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:07,261
I discovered it myself

458
00:57:07,701 --> 00:57:10,941
and immediately had it examined.

459
00:57:11,382 --> 00:57:16,262
It is about
the church's foundation...

460
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,102
Morning!

461
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:24,383
Good morning!

462
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:31,543
I'm sorry, but this church
means a great deal to him.

463
00:57:31,984 --> 00:57:34,024
You have all worked so hard.

464
00:57:34,464 --> 00:57:39,583
Are those the mosaics?
- Yes, they arrived this morning.

465
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,544
Is something the matter?

466
00:57:44,024 --> 00:57:48,224
Our son had an accident,
and Laura flew to London at four

467
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,825
this morning.
- I will pray for you.

468
00:57:52,266 --> 00:57:54,546
It'll be okay.

469
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:57,385
Laura's had some complications since

470
00:57:58,025 --> 00:57:59,145
Christine...

471
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:02,066
You should have gone with her.

472
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:08,106
Can I see the mosaics?
- Of course.

473
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:17,067
Marvelous!

474
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:20,827
The firm has worked
for my family for over 200 years.

475
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:25,228
Will they be able to match those?
- Sure.

476
00:58:26,989 --> 00:58:29,949
May I compare them?

477
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:19,552
Lower me down!

478
00:59:23,233 --> 00:59:24,193
Slowly!

479
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:33,434
Yes, good.

480
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,520
Take that rope!

481
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:56,041
It'll hold!

482
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:59,281
Take that rope!

483
01:01:31,324 --> 01:01:33,284
Hold it tight!

484
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,126
Get him!

485
01:02:06,888 --> 01:02:10,487
You had me worried! Mama mia!

486
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,888
I've never seen anything like it!

487
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:31,009
I need a cigarette.
- Yes, yes.

488
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,330
Would you like
to sit for a few moments?

489
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:37,730
No, I'm going to walk for a bit.

490
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,131
May I walk with you?
- Please.

491
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:49,211
My father was killed in a fall.
- Yes?

492
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:50,851
Yes.

493
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:53,692
Unbelievable.

494
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:55,532
What?

495
01:02:56,172 --> 01:03:00,932
My wife was warned
that I was in danger.

496
01:03:01,373 --> 01:03:02,813
Warned?

497
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,532
It was...

498
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:09,693
like a...

499
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:14,053
kind of prophecy.

500
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:20,494
I wish I didn't have to
believe in prophecy.

501
01:03:20,935 --> 01:03:25,734
I do, but I wish I didn't have to.

502
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:55,977
What happened?

503
01:03:56,618 --> 01:03:59,098
We found a body.

504
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:02,218
I hope it's not another murder.

505
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:14,979
We should go.

506
01:04:43,581 --> 01:04:47,301
Yes.
- Hold her. A little closer.

507
01:04:47,742 --> 01:04:49,142
Don't turn her!

508
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:53,743
Careful!

509
01:05:27,105 --> 01:05:32,065
Excuse me. We waited
until this afternoon...

510
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:47,147
Pronto!

511
01:05:47,587 --> 01:05:51,507
The bishop's driver
will come by and pick up my things.

512
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,148
Thank you.

513
01:06:44,952 --> 01:06:46,152
Laura!

514
01:06:54,154 --> 01:06:55,594
Laura!

515
01:07:09,595 --> 01:07:11,755
Hey, watch out!

516
01:07:40,877 --> 01:07:45,357
Where is the manager?
- It is closed, Signore.

517
01:08:02,919 --> 01:08:05,439
Signor Alexander...
- Signor Baxter...

518
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:11,040
I thought... the end of the season,
you understand. It's my holiday.

519
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,799
Has Mrs. Baxter come back here?
- La Signora?

520
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,560
My wife, yes. Has she come back here?
- But she left this morning.

521
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:23,081
I just saw her on the Grand Canal.

522
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:27,481
Has she come back here?
- She missed the plane?

523
01:08:27,922 --> 01:08:30,762
No, I'm just asking
if my wife's come back here!

524
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:35,161
No, Signore.
We are closed.

525
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:42,683
Momi!

526
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:46,163
Haven't you hung up the sign yet?

527
01:08:46,603 --> 01:08:50,163
We hang up the sign,
and they come anyway!

528
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:08,765
My luggage get away all right? - Yes.
- You didn't see my wife? - No.

529
01:10:37,213 --> 01:10:38,413
Yes.

530
01:10:39,053 --> 01:10:40,253
Here.

531
01:10:42,213 --> 01:10:43,213
Yes.

532
01:10:43,654 --> 01:10:46,094
He's ready.

533
01:10:51,854 --> 01:10:54,574
The inspector is in room 87.

534
01:10:55,014 --> 01:10:57,814
Room 87.
- Yes. I hope that helps.

535
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,695
Thank you.
- Goodbye.

536
01:11:31,257 --> 01:11:32,217
Hello!

537
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:38,338
Sit down, Mr. Baxter.

538
01:11:39,098 --> 01:11:43,498
This is your wife,
and these are the sketches.

539
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:48,898
How are they?
- I guess you'd recognize them.

540
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:56,779
Age makes women grow to look more
like each other. Don't you find that?

541
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,660
Old men decay
and each becomes quite distinct.

542
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:06,740
Women seem to converge, eh?

543
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:13,220
I hadn't thought about it.
- The skill of the police artist

544
01:12:14,181 --> 01:12:17,221
is to make the living appear dead.

545
01:12:22,502 --> 01:12:25,461
You no longer stay at the "Europa"?

546
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:29,302
No, it closed for the winter.

547
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:34,103
Tell me
what happened from the beginning.

548
01:12:34,543 --> 01:12:37,383
My wife met these two women...

549
01:12:37,824 --> 01:12:40,264
a couple of days ago.

550
01:12:40,704 --> 01:12:45,823
The blind one claimed to have seen
Christine, our dead daughter.

551
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:49,744
She said Christine was happy.

552
01:12:50,184 --> 01:12:54,224
My wife collapsed.
When she came round she was changed.

553
01:12:54,665 --> 01:12:58,425
She was happy,
she had come to terms with the death.

554
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,666
She... she was...

555
01:13:03,106 --> 01:13:05,745
her whole self again. We...
- Did you have a row?

556
01:13:06,186 --> 01:13:09,386
A row? No, well...

557
01:13:11,066 --> 01:13:13,946
I was only trying to protect her.

558
01:13:14,387 --> 01:13:18,947
It didn't make any difference
because she saw the women anyway.

559
01:13:19,387 --> 01:13:22,307
And when she came back,

560
01:13:22,747 --> 01:13:25,627
last night, we went to bed.

561
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:28,627
There was a call from England.

562
01:13:29,068 --> 01:13:34,708
Our son goes to school in England.
They told us he had an accident.

563
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:38,189
My wife said that she had been warned.

564
01:13:38,549 --> 01:13:40,989
She got on the first plane to England.

565
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:46,869
I saw her go. I put her on the boat.
I saw her leave at 8:30.

566
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:50,870
Have you called the airport?

567
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:55,670
Yes. The plane was full,
that's all I know.

568
01:13:58,311 --> 01:14:02,790
Please go on.
- Then I saw her.

569
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:08,151
Between 10:30 and 11:00 on a boat.
I was on a Vaporetto.

570
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:11,871
She's here in Venice
with those two women.

571
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:17,472
What is it, Mr. Baxter?

572
01:14:18,513 --> 01:14:20,552
I do not understand.

573
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:26,112
If she's in Venice,
surely she will get in touch with you.

574
01:14:27,553 --> 01:14:29,873
If she can.

575
01:14:31,354 --> 01:14:33,874
What is it you fear?

576
01:14:42,114 --> 01:14:45,074
A killer
on the loose, the murderer...

577
01:14:47,955 --> 01:14:50,915
My wife is not a well woman.

578
01:14:52,996 --> 01:14:54,196
Yes.

579
01:14:55,756 --> 01:14:57,716
Yes, of course.

580
01:15:00,156 --> 01:15:03,116
I would have thought...

581
01:15:06,796 --> 01:15:12,356
there must be more.
- No, no. There is nothing more.

582
01:15:12,997 --> 01:15:17,117
My wife got something
from these two women,

583
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:22,637
something that neither doctors nor I
could give her, something she needed,

584
01:15:23,078 --> 01:15:25,598
so she went with them.
Where?

585
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:28,798
Where I don't know. I was

586
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:33,519
in the pensione last night,
where they lived. Today l,

587
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:38,198
before I came here, I looked for it.
It's vanished.

588
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,240
So now she's with them.

589
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:57,920
Why should one criticize you
for being worried?

590
01:15:58,361 --> 01:16:01,321
Thank you for talking to me.

591
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:04,961
I am grateful.
- Okay, I'll be at the

592
01:16:05,442 --> 01:16:07,322
Palazzo Vendori.

593
01:16:08,202 --> 01:16:11,682
I want you to help me. Try again.

594
01:16:12,123 --> 01:16:14,523
Try to find the pensione.

595
01:16:14,963 --> 01:16:19,922
It will make me feel that we have
your cooperation in a real way.

596
01:16:23,003 --> 01:16:27,323
I don't even know where to start.

597
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:31,204
Start from where
you saw them the last time.

598
01:16:32,685 --> 01:16:33,645
Okay.

599
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:36,124
Good luck.
- Thank you.

600
01:16:36,564 --> 01:16:38,004
Where did you say?

601
01:16:38,444 --> 01:16:40,364
San Nicola dei Mendicoli.

602
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,525
Ah, yes.

603
01:16:51,726 --> 01:16:53,286
Pronto? Sabbione?

604
01:16:53,726 --> 01:16:57,845
Follow Signor Baxter
from San Nicola church.

605
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:48,666
Hello!

606
01:20:49,466 --> 01:20:52,426
Is anyone here? Hello!

607
01:20:54,387 --> 01:20:58,627
Ah, hello Signora.
Do you speak English? - No.

608
01:20:59,068 --> 01:21:02,788
Two old ladies... Sisters...

609
01:21:03,228 --> 01:21:06,187
One...
- Nina!

610
01:21:08,508 --> 01:21:12,388
Hello, Signora. Two...
Do you speak English? - No.

611
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:16,549
Two old ladies...

612
01:21:16,989 --> 01:21:19,589
Sisters. One...

613
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:24,590
What's that called? So. Yes?

614
01:21:25,029 --> 01:21:27,869
Ah! Come along.
- Scottish women.

615
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:31,270
They left this morning.
- A woman was with them.

616
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,550
Yes. My wife.

617
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:35,951
Come along.

618
01:21:44,991 --> 01:21:47,151
But where are they?
- Gone.

619
01:21:48,192 --> 01:21:52,192
But where? - They left today.
Do you want this room?

620
01:21:52,632 --> 01:21:55,072
Me? No, thank you.

621
01:22:07,353 --> 01:22:09,513
Where?
- I don't know. You?

622
01:22:09,954 --> 01:22:11,114
No.

623
01:22:11,554 --> 01:22:14,314
Excuse me. Thank you, Mr. Baxter.

624
01:22:14,754 --> 01:22:17,314
Who are you?
- Sabbione,

625
01:22:17,755 --> 01:22:19,995
Homicide.

626
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:27,075
They're not here.

627
01:22:37,237 --> 01:22:40,197
Yes. Very nice!

628
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,837
Yes, Signor?
- I'm expected. - Your name?

629
01:22:48,277 --> 01:22:53,357
Baxter. John Baxter.
- Mr. Baxter! He's seeing people now.

630
01:22:53,798 --> 01:22:57,758
I'll tell him that you are here.
- Thank you.

631
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:14,199
Your Excellency,
Signor Baxter is here.

632
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,800
Do we have the medical results?
- Yes, Excellency.

633
01:23:36,602 --> 01:23:40,881
Sister... - He won't be long.
- I've to make a call to England.

634
01:23:41,322 --> 01:23:46,282
It's urgent. Could I use that phone?
- You'll have to complete this form.

635
01:23:52,363 --> 01:23:55,723
Can I dial that here?
- Yes.

636
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:04,603
Pronto! To England, please.

637
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:17,005
Mrs. Babbage? John Baxter.

638
01:24:17,446 --> 01:24:19,285
Hello!
- Hello.

639
01:24:19,725 --> 01:24:21,965
I've been trying to ring you,

640
01:24:22,405 --> 01:24:24,885
but the wire's down or something.

641
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:28,166
Johnny's absolutely fine!

642
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:32,966
Quite right as rain. He woke up
this morning with no headache.

643
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:35,407
Fit as a fiddle! The doctor's

644
01:24:35,847 --> 01:24:40,526
let him get up,
and he's now playing around.

645
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:43,167
And it wasn't a concussion.

646
01:24:43,607 --> 01:24:46,887
Johnny can remember everything.
- That's marvelous.

647
01:24:47,328 --> 01:24:50,728
It's something they have to watch.
- Yes.

648
01:24:51,168 --> 01:24:54,328
I suppose you'd like to speak
to your wife... - Sorry?

649
01:24:54,769 --> 01:24:55,889
Here she is.

650
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,408
I...
- Hello, darling. What?

651
01:24:59,849 --> 01:25:02,569
Laura?
- Johnny's perfectly alright.

652
01:25:03,009 --> 01:25:05,369
There's nothing wrong,

653
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:09,609
absolutely nothing. He just has
this little bumb on his forehead.

654
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:12,170
Are you alright? Where are you?

655
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:17,929
I'm at Alberto's.
- I'm catching the 9 o'clock plane.

656
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:22,930
I don't know what time it gets in,
but we can have a late dinner.

657
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:25,491
Everything is very good.

658
01:25:25,931 --> 01:25:28,971
John's fine, and I'm okay.

659
01:25:29,412 --> 01:25:32,652
I thought I saw you here.
I thought I saw you

660
01:25:33,092 --> 01:25:36,731
with the two sisters.
I was certain, I swear it!

661
01:25:37,172 --> 01:25:40,132
Alright, don't worry, sweetheart!

662
01:25:40,572 --> 01:25:44,572
I found the flight number.
- Laura, where are you?

663
01:25:45,013 --> 01:25:48,733
I'm at Porton, John!
Johnny and I just had tea.

664
01:25:49,173 --> 01:25:54,133
It's arriving at 11:00.
- Just a second, I'll get a pencil.

665
01:25:54,734 --> 01:25:59,573
I'll come straight to Alberto's.
- Okay, I'll wait...

666
01:26:00,014 --> 01:26:03,974
I'll see you about eleven, okay?
- Yes. - John, alright?

667
01:26:04,415 --> 01:26:07,375
Okay.
- John, Alright? - Yes.

668
01:26:07,815 --> 01:26:11,775
I love you. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

669
01:26:15,015 --> 01:26:17,815
Let Jesus Christ

670
01:26:18,255 --> 01:26:23,535
lead your heart and spirit
down the right path.

671
01:26:23,976 --> 01:26:24,936
Amen.

672
01:26:29,177 --> 01:26:31,817
John! Are you feeling alright?

673
01:26:32,257 --> 01:26:35,896
Yes. Excuse me, Alberto.

674
01:26:36,337 --> 01:26:39,297
I think I just have to...

675
01:26:40,298 --> 01:26:43,018
May I use your telephone?
- Sure.

676
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:58,779
I don't blame you moving in here.
I would have done the same myself.

677
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:04,339
Do you want to see Johnny again?
- No, thank you. I've said goodbye.

678
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,740
Mrs. Baxter, I think
it would probably be quicker.

679
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:22,301
Good evening.
- Where are the English women?

680
01:27:22,742 --> 01:27:25,182
Up the stairs.

681
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:35,982
Wendy?

682
01:27:37,023 --> 01:27:38,223
Answer me!

683
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:43,983
It's me, John Baxter.
Laura's husband.

684
01:27:44,424 --> 01:27:47,224
What's happened to Wendy?
Where is she?

685
01:27:47,664 --> 01:27:49,824
I don't know, I'll find out.

686
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:53,383
I don't know what's happening.
- Yes, I know.

687
01:27:54,224 --> 01:27:57,384
Where is the other?
- At the British Consulate.

688
01:27:57,824 --> 01:27:59,944
She was very furious.

689
01:28:01,225 --> 01:28:06,185
She's at the British Consulate.
- Yes, but that was hours ago!

690
01:28:07,386 --> 01:28:11,025
It's half past nine now.
I don't know this room.

691
01:28:11,465 --> 01:28:13,985
I want to go home to the hotel.

692
01:28:15,826 --> 01:28:19,106
This is a Police Station.
I don't want to stay here.

693
01:28:19,546 --> 01:28:23,586
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
There was a misunderstanding...

694
01:28:24,027 --> 01:28:27,827
They took us out of our hotel.
We were arrested.

695
01:28:28,268 --> 01:28:33,067
Then they asked us about your wife...
- I know. I'm truly sorry.

696
01:28:33,507 --> 01:28:36,187
I'm taking you back now.
- Yes, please.

697
01:28:36,628 --> 01:28:38,348
May she?
- Yes.

698
01:28:38,788 --> 01:28:42,748
If I could just take your arm?
- Sure.

699
01:28:46,549 --> 01:28:51,188
You can't understand the noises
in a place like this.

700
01:28:51,789 --> 01:28:55,509
I'm so sorry. I just feel that...

701
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:59,150
If you could just take me back.

702
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:28,792
Signora Baxter?
- Yes.

703
01:29:29,232 --> 01:29:32,792
More luggage?
- No. You send by Barberigo? - Yes.

704
01:29:33,233 --> 01:29:36,673
Okay. Do you speak English?
- A little.

705
01:29:38,314 --> 01:29:41,914
In Venice I love that
it's so safe for me to walk.

706
01:29:42,354 --> 01:29:45,314
Watch, steps.
- Thank you.

707
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:50,594
The sound changes, you see,
as you come to a canal,

708
01:29:51,034 --> 01:29:54,994
and the echoes from the walls
are so clear.

709
01:29:55,715 --> 01:29:59,675
My sister hates it.
- That's too bad.

710
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:04,636
She says it's like a city in aspic,

711
01:30:05,076 --> 01:30:09,795
left over from a dinner party,
and all the guests are dead and gone.

712
01:30:10,836 --> 01:30:14,796
It frightens her. Too many shadows.

713
01:30:17,837 --> 01:30:20,797
We are almost there.
- Yes.

714
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:26,597
Milton loved this city.
Did you know that?

715
01:30:27,037 --> 01:30:28,997
No. It's interesting.

716
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,959
This isn't the right way, is it?

717
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,999
The Palazzo di Conte Barberigo.
- Yes, yes.

718
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:48,919
This is the wrong way!
- I'm taking you to Signor Baxter.

719
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:52,279
Yes?
- He is at the Police Station.

720
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,160
It is just along the way.

721
01:31:07,121 --> 01:31:10,681
I've tried to keep them.
They never stay.

722
01:31:11,122 --> 01:31:13,602
They're very wild in Venice.

723
01:31:15,122 --> 01:31:18,082
Do you like cats, Mr. Baxter?
- Yes.

724
01:31:18,843 --> 01:31:23,522
I like them alright,
but they don't like me very much.

725
01:31:23,962 --> 01:31:26,402
Here's the hotel.
- Thank you.

726
01:31:26,843 --> 01:31:28,963
These are swinging doors.
- I remember.

727
01:31:29,403 --> 01:31:33,683
I'll keep them open.
- It's so reassuring to have a man.

728
01:31:34,124 --> 01:31:38,484
We changed hotels cause Wendy said
there were prowlers. And it was dirty.

729
01:31:40,565 --> 01:31:43,524
Careful of the steps.
- Thank you.

730
01:31:44,324 --> 01:31:47,004
Here is the key.
- Thank you.

731
01:31:47,445 --> 01:31:49,885
Room 307.
- 307, good.

732
01:31:52,405 --> 01:31:54,845
Okay, it's here.

733
01:32:01,127 --> 01:32:06,606
They said you left at the station.
- Mr. Baxter's been looking after me.

734
01:32:06,966 --> 01:32:10,086
Has he?
- Yes, she was at the Police Station,

735
01:32:10,527 --> 01:32:13,487
and had been there quite a while
and I thought...

736
01:32:14,647 --> 01:32:18,007
They found your wife then?
- Yes... the killings...

737
01:32:18,448 --> 01:32:23,407
He's explained everything. Have we a
drop of Whisky for him? You'll stay?

738
01:32:23,848 --> 01:32:26,848
Yes.
- There's the miniatures.

739
01:32:27,528 --> 01:32:30,128
We're leaving tomorrow.

740
01:32:30,569 --> 01:32:33,649
Have you put the photographs out?
- Yes.

741
01:32:34,089 --> 01:32:36,569
Just a glass of water for me.

742
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:40,969
I'll fetch it.
Do take a seat, Mr. Baxter.

743
01:32:55,051 --> 01:32:59,131
So you can find it quite easily.

744
01:32:59,571 --> 01:33:00,771
Thank you.

745
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:04,171
Thank you.

746
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:08,011
Doesn't really look like her.
- It doesn't matter.

747
01:33:08,452 --> 01:33:10,892
No?
- No.

748
01:33:13,373 --> 01:33:16,413
Please, your photograph.

749
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,293
What?

750
01:33:21,893 --> 01:33:23,133
My God!

751
01:33:24,373 --> 01:33:28,333
Thank you for your help. Bye-bye.

752
01:33:28,774 --> 01:33:30,734
Goodbye.

753
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,376
Thank you.

754
01:33:49,816 --> 01:33:52,776
You're wearing odd socks.
- You put out my clothes.

755
01:33:53,216 --> 01:33:55,416
I know. I was merely informing you.
- Thank you.

756
01:33:56,257 --> 01:34:00,496
I must go... - You've been wearing
them all day. - Let him be off.

757
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:05,256
Wait! - Is there anything I can do?
- No, it's alright. Goodbye.

758
01:34:05,697 --> 01:34:08,617
She'll be alright.

759
01:34:16,618 --> 01:34:17,817
Wait!

760
01:34:18,658 --> 01:34:20,698
Fetch him back!
- Wait!

761
01:34:21,138 --> 01:34:25,538
Please, please, fetch him back!

762
01:34:38,179 --> 01:34:41,699
Please, fetch him back!

763
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,100
Get him back!

764
01:34:45,741 --> 01:34:47,861
Fetch him! Fetch him!

765
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:53,501
Get him!

766
01:34:54,782 --> 01:34:57,621
Get him back!

767
01:35:10,263 --> 01:35:12,583
Mr. Baxter!

768
01:35:13,023 --> 01:35:14,822
Mr. Baxter!

769
01:35:15,263 --> 01:35:17,223
Mr. Baxter?

770
01:35:32,785 --> 01:35:36,544
Hello, is John here?
- Quickly, come quickly!

771
01:35:36,985 --> 01:35:39,705
What is it?

772
01:35:47,266 --> 01:35:49,786
Hurry!
- Is this it?

773
01:35:50,227 --> 01:35:54,266
Mrs. Baxter...
- Is it Heather? - Please.

774
01:35:54,706 --> 01:35:57,426
Mrs. Baxter.
- Where is he? - I couldn't find him.

775
01:35:57,867 --> 01:36:01,027
I saw Christine!
- He left.

776
01:36:01,827 --> 01:36:06,707
Find him! You must warn him!
- Get him back!

777
01:36:07,148 --> 01:36:10,268
She told you to leave.
- Where did he go? - I don't know.

778
01:36:10,708 --> 01:36:14,027
She told you to leave.
- Where did he go?

779
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:17,988
She told you to leave Venice!
She told you...

780
01:36:18,429 --> 01:36:20,549
Beware!

781
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:42,190
Laura! Mrs. Baxter!

782
01:37:07,353 --> 01:37:11,232
Come here! With the boat. Up here!

783
01:37:12,193 --> 01:37:15,313
No, with the boat! Wait!

784
01:37:22,955 --> 01:37:24,435
Wait!

785
01:37:27,555 --> 01:37:28,795
Ugly monster!

786
01:37:29,955 --> 01:37:33,475
When I catch you, I'll kill you!

787
01:37:33,915 --> 01:37:36,355
Where do you go?

788
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:39,676
Hold her!

789
01:37:40,116 --> 01:37:41,076
Run!

790
01:37:46,957 --> 01:37:49,436
You piece of shit!

791
01:39:45,807 --> 01:39:50,087
It's alright. Everything's okay.
I'm a friend.

792
01:39:51,607 --> 01:39:52,887
I'm coming.

793
01:40:07,769 --> 01:40:10,249
She is possessed by the devil!

794
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:17,610
It's okay.

795
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:22,530
I'm a friend.

796
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:25,890
I won't hurt you.

797
01:40:28,251 --> 01:40:29,451
Come on.

798
01:40:29,851 --> 01:40:30,811
Darling!

799
01:40:37,852 --> 01:40:39,092
Wait...

800
01:40:43,052 --> 01:40:44,692
Nooo!
- Wait...

801
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:10,460
Laura!
