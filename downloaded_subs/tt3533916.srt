1
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,095
MAN:
We rolling?
MAN #2: Yeah.

2
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,798
All right. I know
I've been a little, uh--

3
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,768
maybe a little
stricter than usual
about this kind of thing.

4
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,705
But it's all for a good cause.
You just have to trust me.

5
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,708
Aren't you rolling?
You don't even have
the damn thing plugged in.

6
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,618
I've invited some cameras

7
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,257
to film our little
sermon here today.

8
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,794
'Cause people have been asking,
"What's going on over there
at Heaven's Veil?

9
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,130
What are they doing
up there at that ranch?

10
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,298
Are they being held
against their will?"

11
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,734
- Are you a prisoner here?
- No.

12
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,803
Are you
a prisoner here?
No.

13
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,806
No. Just smile for
the camera, people. Wave.

14
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,308
Give me this Bible.
This Bible--

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,912
This here book,
this is a tool, people.

16
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:32,151
And as such,
it only has the power
that we ascribe to it.

17
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,952
But you,

18
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,655
you are something
much different.

19
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,658
Your body is of the earth, yes,
but you are not your body.

20
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,995
You are mightier
than the flesh.

21
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:48,867
We don't need no book
to tell us about the soul!

22
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,471
- (gasping, cheering)
- Did you see any lightning
come down out of that sky?

23
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,706
- (congregation laughing)
- I've been put here

24
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,110
to resurrect mankind
from his fallen state

25
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:03,015
and bring the power
of the etheric realm
back into his hands.

26
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:07,853
I'm gonna show you, and you,
and you, and every one of ya

27
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,989
how to push your spirit
through the veil.

28
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,292
It's a deathless reality,

29
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,061
souls aglow
with the ever-real

30
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,397
eternal life!

31
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,633
(cheering, applauding)

32
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:45,324
<i>(police radio chatter, faint)</i>
<i>(sirens wailing, faint)</i>

33
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:49,494
<i> 30 miles outside the town</i>
<i> of Hidden Lake, California,</i>

34
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,365
<i> you'll find</i>
<i> this small ranch known</i>
<i> simply as The Veil,</i>

35
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,201
<i> named by the members of</i>
<i> the Heaven's Veil cult,</i>

36
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,104
<i> the cult that lived</i>
<i> and died here.</i>

37
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:03,008
<i>The FBI raided the compound</i>
<i>this morning at 8:52 AM,</i>

38
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,577
<i>only to find tragedy.</i>

39
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,682
<i>Every man, woman and child</i>
<i>in this once-thriving community</i>
<i>lies dead--</i>

40
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:14,920
<i> dead at the hands</i>
<i> of their leader,</i>
<i> Jim Jacobs.</i>

41
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,456
MAN:
Okay, and we're out.
WOMAN: Pack the mikes.

42
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:22,094
- Wait, what's that?
- (people chattering)

43
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,730
WOMAN:
Everybody, stay back.
Come on! Come on!

44
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,965
MAN:
Hold it! Hold it!

45
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,434
Hey, guys.
Stay back.

46
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,671
Don't worry.
They're not dead.
He's gonna bring them back.

47
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,736
<i> (line ringing)</i>

48
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,304
<i> WOMAN:</i>
<i> Hello?</i>
I'll do it.

49
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,672
<i> What?</i>

50
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,141
<i>Sarah?</i>
I said I'll do it.

51
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,176
I'll talk to you.

52
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,078
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Thank you, Sarah.</i>

53
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,591
(people chattering)

54
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,931
Okay. Would you
do me a favor?

55
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,568
Could you run this
up your shirt and
clip it right there?

56
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,104
Sorry.

57
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,106
Thanks.
Okay, is that good?
WOMAN: Yep.

58
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,108
WOMAN:
All right, guys.
Quiet down, please.

59
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,646
(sighs)
Okay. Um--

60
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,517
Why don't we start
with your name.

61
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,951
Then we can
go from there.

62
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,454
Okay.

63
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,955
Um...

64
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,060
my name
is Sarah Hope.

65
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,096
I was-- I--

66
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,566
I<i> am</i> the only li--

67
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,436
the only known survivor

68
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,471
of Heaven's Veil.

69
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,378
I have no idea

70
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,647
why they didn't
kill me too.

71
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,820
Did your, um--

72
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,689
Did your parents
die there also?

73
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,528
Uh, they must have.
I don't know.

74
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,966
I'm not-- I'm not sure
who my parents were.

75
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,635
I don't even know

76
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,270
my real name.

77
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,273
They named me--
They named me Sarah Hope--

78
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,175
(scoffs)
at the hospital.

79
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,711
Uh...

80
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,817
I was in foster care,
a lot of different homes,
till I was 16.

81
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,624
I think this is
me and my brother
and my sister.

82
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:16,461
But I'm not sure.
I was only five.

83
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,129
This is that
really famous one,

84
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,399
the one of Jim
and his followers.

85
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,671
I know
this is really hard,

86
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,375
but there is a reason
why we...

87
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,512
reached out to you.

88
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,449
Like I said earlier
on the phone,

89
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:42,087
we found something
that no one's
ever seen before.

90
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,699
Do you see that camera
right there?

91
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,302
And right there?

92
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,972
And right there.

93
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,374
They were filming.

94
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,645
But there's no record
of anything.

95
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,413
Nothing's ever
been released.

96
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,420
And there's this.

97
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,423
They never found this room.

98
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,562
Not in the farmhouse
or any of the buildings.

99
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,400
No one knows
what happened that day.

100
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,736
Why did they do it?

101
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,440
I wanna go back out there
and find those films.

102
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,510
Maybe we'd find out
what really happened.

103
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,380
<i>JIM:</i>
<i>We're in this room.</i>

104
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,915
<i>We feel the silence.</i>

105
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,619
(sighs)

106
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:51,022
There is a time
for every season,
Mama.

107
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,826
This child
has been cut down
before her time.

108
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,629
How long?

109
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,599
How long
has your daughter
been this way?

110
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,766
(sniffs)

111
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,470
Two years.
Mmm.

112
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,706
The doctors say
she's brain-dead.

113
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,476
Doctors.

114
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,212
Doctors.

115
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,086
The doctors don't
want her well, Mama.

116
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,122
They like that money
coming in.

117
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,759
(exhales)

118
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,961
No, sir.

119
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,165
The child's mind
is not dead.

120
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,067
Will you join hands
with me?

121
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,672
We need to
create an opening,

122
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,607
close the circuit

123
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,644
so the girl can
find her way back home.

124
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,814
Please. Indulge me.

125
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,519
Please.

126
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,727
Thank you.

127
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,865
There we go.
All right.

128
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,967
Now, Mama,
I want you
to be brave.

129
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:12,303
Something happened
before the child
got lost,

130
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,105
about a week before.

131
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,876
No.
Mm-hmm.

132
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,311
No. Nothing.
Not to her,
Mama.

133
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,180
Nothing.
To you.

134
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,183
To you.

135
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,852
Something so terrible,
it froze your heart,

136
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,622
and you swore you'd never
tell a living soul.

137
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,691
But the spirit
sees all.

138
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,294
(sobbing) No!
The spirit knows all.
The spirit understands all.

139
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,631
Now whisper it.
Whisper it to me.
Let it out.

140
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,534
No. No.
Let it out.

141
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,536
JIM:
Whisper.

142
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,473
(shouting)
Whisper it in my ear!
Give it to me!

143
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,408
Tell me the truth.
The truth!

144
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,811
The real truth!
Now!

145
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,418
(gasping)

146
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,857
He's going down!
Get his head.
I got his feet.

147
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,059
Grab him. Grab him.
Hold him.

148
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,062
I've got his head.
Rotate him. Look out.

149
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,448
(Mother continues
sobbing)

150
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,987
(monitor beeping)

151
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,096
So, how long
have you guys
worked together?

152
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,032
- Just long enough
to talk us into this.
- (sighs)

153
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,769
We actually met
in film school, so we've
done everything together--

154
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,238
industrials,
um, Web series--

155
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,974
- Infomercials.
- Once. We did one infomercial.

156
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,409
"Your skin
will practically glow."

157
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,045
- That was the best payday
we ever had.
- Yeah, for three days of hell.

158
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,549
Uh, excuse me.
I'm pretty sure you slept
with the spokesmodel.

159
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,417
Hey,
she was very smart.
Oh!

160
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,287
- She reads books.
- (man, driver laughing)

161
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,957
But this film?

162
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,893
This is different.

163
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,796
We've wanted to
make this film
for a long time.

164
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,165
Why is it
so important to you?

165
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,699
Wait,
you didn't tell her?

166
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,809
Uh, our dad,
he led the FBI team
that day,

167
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,912
the day
when everyone, um--

168
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,815
Died.

169
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,251
Our dad was never really
the same after that.

170
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,287
Neither was our mom.

171
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,056
So that's why you have
all those photos.

172
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,226
That's why we're here.

173
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,430
Look at this guy.

174
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,777
(van door opens)

175
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,214
Mr. Wheeler, hi.
Maggie, from the documentary.

176
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,483
Uh-huh.
Thank you so much for letting us
shoot on your property.

177
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,220
- I know this is--
- Twenty-five years,
I kept folk away from here.

178
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,291
Who are all these folks?
Thought it was just you.

179
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,061
Oh, no, uh,
this is my crew.

180
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,697
- Christian, my brother,
is the editor.
- Hello, sir.

181
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,566
Nick is our gaffer.
Matt's our cameraman.

182
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,201
Ed, grip.
What's up?

183
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,137
Jill does sound,
and Ann is our PA.

184
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,773
- And this is Sarah Hope.
- I know who she is.

185
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,913
Thought it was you.

186
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,514
Bound to come back home.

187
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,316
Was wondering
if you ever would.

188
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,592
(van doors close)

189
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,638
(whispers)
Oh, wow.

190
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,081
(exhales)
You okay?

191
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,582
Hey, hey.
What?

192
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,318
Get this.
Okay.

193
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,852
Get down.
Get down.

194
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,461
- Oh, shit.
- Sarah! Sarah!

195
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,799
- Sarah?
- Is she okay?

196
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,101
- What happened?
Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

197
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,172
I don't know.

198
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,408
Maybe we shouldn't
be here.

199
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,746
MAGGIE: All right,
we'll set up camp over there.
(chattering)

200
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,925
Thanks.

201
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:46,697
Can you imagine
how weird this must be
for her to be back here?

202
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,100
She's the one
that made it out.

203
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,475
My whole life has been
defined by this place,

204
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,746
by what happened.

205
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,517
It's the same for me.

206
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,723
After it all happened,
I, um--

207
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,959
I was only three
at the time,

208
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,529
but... my father, uh,

209
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,933
killed himself.

210
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,502
What?

211
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,374
I found him
hanging in the garage.

212
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,516
I thought he was
playing a game.

213
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,525
We both lost our families
because of this place.

214
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,163
I need to know why.

215
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,773
(beeping)

216
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,042
(shutter clicking)

217
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,297
(voices whispering)
Sarah. Sarah.

218
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,576
(whispers)
Sarah.

219
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,816
(Jim speaking in tongues)

220
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:25,256
(speaking in tongues
continues)

221
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,896
(screams)

222
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,931
(gasps, sighs)

223
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,601
MAGGIE:
Ed? Ed!

224
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,070
NICK: Ed!
Do you see him down there?

225
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,039
MATT:
No, he's not over here.
MAGGIE: Ed! Ed!

226
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,342
Ed, stop messing around!

227
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,178
Sarah,
have you seen Ed?

228
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,747
He's gotta be
around here someplace.
He left all of his stuff.

229
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,882
His wallet is right there.
He couldn't have gone far.

230
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,918
Ed,
where the hell are you?

231
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,754
MAGGIE:
Ed! Ed, breakfast is ready!

232
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,389
Yeah,
that should get him.

233
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,458
Maggie!
I'm gonna
look up front.

234
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,761
- Come take a look at this.
-<i> All right, what is it?</i>

235
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,999
I don't know.
Um, just look here.

236
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,303
MATT:
Who moved the camera?

237
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,708
CHRISTIAN:
Look right there.

238
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,711
Look at that.
We got a ghost. Wow.

239
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:24,415
ANN:
Nick, it's not a ghost.
You don't believe in ghosts?

240
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,484
And watch
this part.

241
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,822
MAGGIE:
That's where Ed was sleeping.

242
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,795
The van's gone.

243
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,164
It's gone.
What do you mean
it's gone?

244
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,499
What?

245
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,167
CHRISTIAN:
Let's have a look.

246
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,905
CHRISTIAN:
Oh, what the fuck?

247
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:51,475
This isn't like him.
I know. He's a grumpy fucker,
but he's not a quitter.

248
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,778
We crawled through swamps
with this guy. There's
no way he'd bail on us.

249
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,980
Looks like he did.
What do we
do now?

250
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,983
- Has anybody got any bars?
- JILL: I'm trying,
but I got nothing.

251
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,787
- What do we do? Go back?
- No. We have, like, 80 grand
worth of equipment in there.

252
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,656
- That's 80 grand
we<i> do not</i> have.
- Yeah, exactly.

253
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,826
Well, someone's gotta
go down for some help.

254
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,866
Me?

255
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,102
Yeah.
You're the PA.

256
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:21,772
You're gonna send me
down there to walk 20 miles,
probably till dark?

257
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,775
Don't exaggerate.
It's 16 miles.
(scoffs) This one.

258
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,777
Ann, it's okay.
Nick will go.

259
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,881
Oh, really?
Yeah.

260
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,217
Matt'll cover for you.
You'll be down before dark.
Yeah.

261
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,219
Well, thanks, pal.

262
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,722
(scoffs)
Fine.
No, wait.
I'll come with you.

263
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,625
Oh. I thought
you didn't wanna go.

264
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:45,229
It's better than staying
up here with that creepy
farmer guy out there.

265
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,565
(laughs)
All right.
What?

266
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,735
- Be careful.
- Yeah, I'll keep an eye out
for inbred farmers.

267
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,070
No, Nick, she needs to
be careful of you.

268
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,805
Oh!

269
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,440
Ow, Maggie.
Ow.
Stop it.

270
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,845
Let's set up
the next interview
by the church.

271
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,880
You gonna need
both cameras?
Yeah.

272
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,250
We need to go
across the lake.

273
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,755
Hmm?
Across the lake?

274
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,224
I remembered something.

275
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,658
Are you seeing this?

276
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,434
It's a strip that's shallow.

277
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,703
Come on.
Goes all the way across.

278
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,305
Let's go.

279
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,855
Sarah?
Where are we going?

280
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,293
To that place.

281
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,978
And you think
this is it?

282
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,816
I remember it now.

283
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,687
It was Jim's
special place.

284
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,237
(groans)
(coughing)

285
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,706
Ugh.

286
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,229
(inhales, exhales)

287
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,341
No lights.

288
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,996
(gasps)

289
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,733
I hate rats.
Not my favorite
either.

290
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,802
(squeaking)

291
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,982
Oh, I have another one
right here in my pack.

292
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,819
It's, like-- It's inside,
in, like, the flashlight pouch.
Right there.

293
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,255
(all chattering)

294
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,861
Here they are.

295
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:46,697
These are the films
you were looking for.

296
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:54,304
Whoa!
Sarah, are you okay?

297
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,141
Wha-- Yeah. I think
I fell through this chair.

298
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,143
What do you mean,
you fell through it?

299
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,712
My hand went through
the leather.

300
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:09,153
(gasping)
Oh-- Oh, my--

301
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,523
Oh, my God!
(screaming)

302
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,399
Come here, Sarah.
Come here. Come here.

303
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:25,569
(groaning, muttering)
Give me your hand.

304
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,805
(coughing, retching)

305
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,574
- Sarah. Sarah!
- (groaning continues)

306
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,409
Here we go.
Fuck.

307
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:41,051
(gasping)
Okay. Okay. Okay.

308
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,322
Well, Maggie,

309
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,392
clearly nobody
ever found
this place.

310
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:52,329
There's no way
we would have found this place
if it wasn't for her.

311
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,569
What do you think?

312
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,774
We're gonna need to
get some lights on
in there.

313
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,076
It's actually
in pretty good shape.

314
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,045
If it's got fuel.

315
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,713
Here we go.
Careful.

316
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:13,283
(cranking, sputtering)

317
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,853
(engine starts)

318
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,654
Let's check it out.

319
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,832
(switch clicking)

320
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,270
- Oh! God!
- God.

321
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,541
(exhales)
Why don't you
try another switch?

322
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,810
Why don't<i> you</i>
try another switch?

323
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,416
JILL:
Ugh.

324
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,658
Here they are.

325
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,494
We can watch 'em
if I can get this to work.

326
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,599
MAGGIE:
Look at this.

327
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,201
JILL:
What?

328
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,869
Oh, wow.

329
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,710
No, no, no!
Don't touch that.

330
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:50,614
I'm sorry. It's just
that it's next to a body

331
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,183
and it's probably
evidence of some
kind of crime,

332
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,220
and if you touch it
with all your hands--

333
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:04,995
Whatever is on this tape--

334
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,965
Should go to the police
because it's evidence.

335
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,300
We're not gonna take it
to the police.
M-Maybe we should.

336
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:13,570
- But n-not right away.
- I don't really wanna
argue next to a body.

337
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,139
All right, we should--
It's entirely decomposed.

338
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,809
JILL: Okay, if you wanna
enable yourself into
doing whatever you do.

339
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,496
That's Karen Sweetzer,
the nurse that followed Jim.

340
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,932
The one
they never found.

341
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,001
<i>(Karen gasping)</i>
<i>I got away.</i>

342
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,072
<i> They--</i>
<i> They tried to get me.</i>

343
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,774
<i> But I got away.</i>

344
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,576
When did she
record this?

345
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,379
Must be after
the FBI raid.

346
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,948
<i>They're gonna--</i>
<i>They're gonna come get me.</i>

347
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,951
<i>They wanna control me</i>
<i>like I'm a puppet.</i>

348
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:07,457
<i>(sobbing)</i>
<i>They want in, but I'm not</i>
<i>gonna let anybody in.</i>

349
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:11,094
<i>Do you hear that, Jim?</i>

350
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,867
<i>I will not let anybody in.</i>
<i>I didn't come here to be taken.</i>

351
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:21,805
<i>Even if they get in,</i>
<i>they won't get me.</i>

352
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,583
<i> (gasping)</i>

353
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,852
<i> Sarah.</i>

354
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,589
<i> I want you to--</i>

355
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:42,159

00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:45,062

<i> (choking, groaning)</i>

358
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,311
Sh-She looked, like, um,
drugged, you know.

359
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,780
Yeah.

360
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,150
She's so manic.
I mean, so paranoid.

361
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:11,521
What was she talking about?
That the FBI was gonna
use her like a puppet?

362
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,492
She was so loyal
to the end.

363
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:25,268
<i>(TV: voices whispering)</i>

364
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,438
<i> I have become</i>
<i> what never fails.</i>

365
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,876
<i> And the dead shall be</i>

366
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,445
<i> And we shall be changed.</i>

367
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,355
We need to
watch the rest
of those films.

368
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,327
You got the whole thing
in frame?
Yeah, it looks great.

369
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,030
It works.
We just need a new bulb.

370
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,099
Sure there's
a Kmart around.

371
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,748
Oh, look at this.

372
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,587
MAGGIE:
"Pancuronium bromide."

373
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,322
It's for lethal injections.

374
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,591
It halts
the respiratory system.

375
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,560
Your lungs stop working.
You suffocate.

376
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,099
Hey. Hey.

377
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:32,202
Be careful with those.
They don't have needle guards.

378
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:36,039
Seriously?
Why are you
touching needles?

379
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,841
Sorry.
Don't touch--

380
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,010
Don't touch anything.
Sorry. I wasn't
gonna touch the top.

381
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,649
Jim's room.

382
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,453
Seems about right.

383
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,589
Ugh.

384
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,591
Fuck station
Partridge Family.

385
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:00,030
Why don't we just go back
down to the compound,

386
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:02,532
wait for Nick and Ann,
figure everything out there?

387
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,868
How about we just look
for the projector bulbs?

388
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,636
Sorry.
(sighs)

389
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,518
CHRISTIAN:
Projector bulb!

390
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,989
Okay, I loaded up
the earliest film.

391
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:29,292
- All right. Rolling.
- Here we go.

392
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,233
(camera whirring)
All right, is it filming?

393
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,335
WOMAN:
Uh, yeah, I hear it.

394
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,838
Well, when we get
the new cameras

395
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,441
we'll be able
to check it right away.

396
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,977
And how are they
different?

397
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,112
Uh, they're new video cameras.

398
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:53,683
You can buy the tapes
at the supermarket-- $24.99.

399
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:58,155
You don't have to send it all
in to Kodak and-- I-I--

400
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,094
WOMAN:
Okay, Jim.
Whenever you're ready.

401
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,629
(inhales)

402
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,298
This is film
number one.

403
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,702
I'm Jim Jacobs,
and we are here
at Heaven's Veil ranch.

404
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,672
It's December 11, 1982.

405
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,975
When we started here,
there was just a few of us.

406
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:22,546
Small group of seven.
A family.

407
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:28,351
There's a small town
in Indiana.

408
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,722
Whenever I think of it,
a great deal of pain comes.

409
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,959
As a child,
I was undoubtedly
one of the poor.

410
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,861
Never accepted.

411
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:41,264
Born, as it were,
on the wrong side
of the tracks.

412
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,568
And when I was
very small,

413
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:49,172
I lost my father and my mother
to an unholy fire, they tell me.

414
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:54,477
I knew too early
the pain of suffering,
the pain of loss.

415
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:59,716
But tragedy
can beget transformation.

416
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,852
I believe that mankind

417
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,256
is on the cusp
of a new reality,

418
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,660
one that transcends
pain, suffering,

419
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,229
even death.

420
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,366
I've discovered
that the spiritual nature

421
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:19,836
is attached to the human form
at certain points,

422
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,606
represented by
the three nails
of the crucifixion.

423
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,709
And by three
alchemical initiations,

424
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,545
I can now draw these nails

425
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,847
and permit
the divine nature of man

426
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,116
to come down
from its cross.

427
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,086
I can release the nails

428
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,455
that pin the spirit
to the body

429
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,925
and free the soul
from its mortal coil.

430
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,629
Jim is in
a meditative state.

431
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,365
Once he reaches
full trance,

432
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,601
he will leave his body
in the physical form

433
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,672
and he'll manifest himself
in spirit in this room.

434
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,442
Father?

435
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,314
Father, are you here?

436
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,820
Father, if you are here,

437
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,957
reach out to us.

438
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,236
Reach out to us, Jim.

439
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,183
(gasping)

440
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,619
- Jim?
- (gasping continues)

441
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,288
- I don't think he's breathing.
- Jim, come back to us.

442
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,023
Jim,
come back to us.
Focus.

443
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,792
(gasps)
There you go.

444
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,661
There you go.
Slow, controlled.

445
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,331
(inhales deeply)
Okay.
That's good.

446
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,333
Mommy. Mommy.
What happened?

447
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,802
Sarah.
Come here.

448
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,937
Okay.
Is he okay?

449
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:04,808
Yeah, he's okay.
What are you doing up?
I was playing, Mom.

450
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,943
Okay, come.
Time to go to bed.

451
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,624
She was my mom.

452
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,795
Karen Sweetzer was--

453
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,877
So horrible.

454
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,213
I mean-- Ugh.

455
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,582
So sad for her,
and so gruesome.

456
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,818
You know?

457
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,188
I just think,
deep down,

458
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,190
maybe
she was hoping

459
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,726
her mom
was still alive

460
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,395
somewhere.

461
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,188
Mom.

462
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:29,659
I guess
you were my mom.

463
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,492
I am so sorry
this happened to you.

464
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,128
I feel like--

465
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,434
like something

466
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,336
wanted me
to come back here,

467
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:18,208
to bring them here
with me, but I--

468
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,911
Something about it
feels so wrong.

469
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,646
(screaming)

470
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:29,018
(Sarah screaming)

471
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,488
Sarah! Sarah?

472
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,690
Sarah!
(screaming continues)

473
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:36,659
- (sobbing, whimpering)
- What happened?

474
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,628
What happened?

475
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,830
What happened?
(sobbing continues)

476
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,005
What happened?

477
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,074
SARAH (whispers):
Nothing happened.

478
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,344
Nothing happened.

479
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,118
ANN:
Help us! Help!
NICK: Matt!

480
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,054
Please!
NICK:
Guys! We need help!

481
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,223
- Do you hear that?
- MATT: It's Nick.

482
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,791
Help!

483
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,794
NICK:
Maggie!
ANN: Maggie!

484
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:14,163
Ann?
Maggie!

485
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,900
- What is it? What?
- (whimpering, sobbing)

486
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,434
Ed.

487
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,741
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

488
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,145
Oh. He must have
been doing 90.

489
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,014
I guess
he missed that curve.

490
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:34,017
- Why was he going so fast?
- Someone was in the car
with him.

491
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,086
No one was in the car with him.
That doesn't make any sense.

492
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:40,189
What are you talking about?
Who was in the car with him?

493
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,357
Go ahead.
Tell her
your theory.

494
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,326
The other air bag blew.
Look!

495
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,428
It doesn't matter though.

496
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,232
One blows, they both blow.
That's how it works.

497
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,200
Besides, who's
gonna come up here?

498
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:55,438
Someone hiked 16 miles to
steal a shitty van, and Ed
gives his life to stop 'em?

499
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,675
Goddamn it, you guys.
I can't believe this.

500
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:02,512
Did you--
Did you check him?

501
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:04,647
I mean,
he's for sure dead?
Yeah.

502
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,786
- Are you sure?
- Feel free to
check him again, Maggie.

503
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,407
(sighs)
(Jill sobs)

504
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,843
- Oh, God.
- Shit.

505
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,147
So we go to the cops,
right?
Yes.

506
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,618
Yes, we go to the cops
when we can. There's no way
we can make it there by dawn.

507
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,820
And that farmer's
still out there.
JILL: Seriously?

508
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:46,356
Farmer John
did not kill Ed, okay?

509
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:50,593
It's 12 miles
down to the main road,

510
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:54,263
and then it's another 20 miles
to, like, the nearest anything.

511
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:57,500
Do you guys wanna
walk down in the dark, or--

512
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,505
What about Ed?

513
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:11,814
(door opens)

514
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:14,684
(sighs)
Oh, God.

515
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,538
We'll leave
in the morning.

516
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,074
Yeah.

517
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:45,915
Do you remember
your mom at all?

518
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,551
I can't remember.

519
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:53,289
I did always feel
like she wanted me back,

520
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,427
for us to be
a family again.

521
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:00,963
Maybe it's just

522
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,099
wishful thinking.

523
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:09,205
I don't know, I--
(sighs)

524
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,442
I do feel like the answers
are in that house.

525
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:14,977
I do too.

526
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,316
You wanna go back?

527
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,354
I do.

528
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:27,356
Maggie, I thought
we just decided
that we were leaving.

529
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,358
We are.
In the morning.

530
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,962
We're gonna
go back to the house
and watch those films.

531
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,732
Who's coming with?

532
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,102
Christian, come on.

533
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,404
Yeah, no, I was coming.
I was totally coming.

534
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,307
Anyone else?

535
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,115
All right. I guess,
uh, see you guys
in the morning.

536
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,920
Seriously?

537
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,590
You guys aren't
a little curious?

538
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:04,127
No. Not really.

539
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,797
Wait up.

540
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:12,602
All right, well,
I'm not babysitting.

541
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:18,641
Nick, wait.
Oh, come on.

542
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,778
(sighs)

543
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:28,050
Hey, I know you guys
are really tired, but
I kinda need one more thing.

544
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:32,789
- Can you grab
some B-roll for me?
- Now?

545
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,123
Please.

546
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,000
You are obsessed.

547
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:51,207
Look, Maggie, how far
are we gonna go with this?

548
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:56,946
We lost our family
because of this.

549
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,247
So did she.

550
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,853
So as far as we need to.
Right?

551
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,421
Okay.

552
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:16,065
We good?
Yeah.

553
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:23,806
To be released
and come back.

554
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:27,543
Released and come back.

555
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,313
This is the loop
that we must close.

556
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,215
I must journey
to the other side,

557
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,350
where I will extract
the first nail,

558
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,286
and then I must return
through the golden door--

559
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,822
(inhales)

560
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:41,457
into my body.

561
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:46,495
Karen is preparing
the first injection.

562
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:50,066
It's a little cocktail
of my own making.

563
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,568
There's some luminous ether
in there, some bismuth--

564
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,036
(clears throat)

565
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:57,573
sodium pentothal.

566
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,809
(inhales)

567
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,279
Some mercury.

568
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,550
Yes, it's quite poisonous.

569
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:10,086
Why did you create
this drug, Jim?

570
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:12,688
Um,

571
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,691
I'm having trouble--

572
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:19,562
I'm having trouble
conjugating.

573
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,298
Re-conjugating.

574
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,934
KAREN:
Re-conjugating?

575
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:28,170
(sighs)

576
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:30,239
(mumbling)

577
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,312
(voices whispering)
Do you hear that?

578
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:41,450
Yeah. I can't see
where it's coming from.

579
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,786
It's not from the film.

580
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,589
Could be
from another room?

581
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,126
Communicate with us.

582
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,461
We're here for you.
Push through, Jim.

583
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:55,097
Push through.
Come through to us.

584
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,200
Push through, Jim.
Push through.

585
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:05,341
(shrieking)

586
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:19,155
(gasps)

587
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,841
(Jim's voice)
Hello, brothers and sisters.

588
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,077
It's a beautiful day.

589
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,379
Jim, is that you?

590
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,587
The body is nothing
but a shell.

591
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:56,525
A cycle of physical ego

592
00:49:57,762 --> 00:50:01,864
for us to outgrow
and discard

593
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,532
as we please.

594
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,370
(gasps)

595
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:11,407
(inhales deeply)

596
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,955
The first nail is ours.

597
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:27,423
(applauding)

598
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,563
Now what?

599
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:42,705
(voices whispering)

600
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,740
I'm not staying
in here.

601
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,642
(tool ratcheting)

602
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,744
What do you think?
I don't know.

603
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,450
Oh, shit.
Spark plug's fried.

604
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,821
I don't even think they
make this kind anymore.

605
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,757
I think I saw
some spark plugs
in the pantry.

606
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,826
Great.

607
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:09,065
(scoffs)

608
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,600
No, no, I'll go.

609
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,271
Thank you, Nick.

610
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,872
MAGGIE:
Thank you, Nick.

611
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:19,275
Yeah, I'll say hi
to Jim for ya.

612
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:21,544
They look like this.

613
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,180
Oh, like a spark plug?
Yeah, thanks, Matt.

614
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:32,488
(door closes)

615
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:08,290
(footsteps)

616
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,467
(footsteps)

617
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:22,538
Somebody here?

618
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,009
(door closes)

619
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,330
Okay, if there's
somebody here,

620
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,832
show yourself.

621
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:11,020
All right, look.

622
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,925
We're not here
to hurt you, okay?

623
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:24,400
What do you want?

624
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:26,835
<i>(whispering)</i>
<i>Sarah.</i>

625
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,704
I said, what do you want?

626
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,246
(screaming)

627
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,430
What's taking him
so long?

628
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,601
Hey, Maggie.

629
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,636
If we can fix
the generator,
we're going home, right?

630
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,840
Where's Sarah?

631
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,911
Sarah!
CHRISTIAN:
Sarah?

632
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:15,718
Nick!
Sarah?

633
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,420
We don't have time
for this.

634
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,289
Nick, stop dicking around.

635
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,691
Nick, come on.
This isn't funny, man.

636
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:32,067
- He went out to the gennie.
- Jesus!

637
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,637
Sarah, you scared
the shit out of me.

638
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,113
It just--
It just came back on.
I didn't even touch it.

639
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,815
Yeah, it was
a breaker inside.

640
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,791
I really don't wanna
go back inside.
It's just too--

641
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,493
Too weird?

642
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,762
Too creepy?
Too scary?
Nick! Stop.

643
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,397
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.

644
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,898
Come here.

645
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,513
(chuckles)

646
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:25,054
Uh, we should probably go--
(grunts)

647
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,365
Let's use this one.

648
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,000
Was that
from March of '80?

649
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,669
Yeah. Where the hell
are Ann and Nick?

650
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:43,806
Right here.

651
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:46,475
Oh, hey.

652
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:49,478
Can you please take
these mikes and put 'em
in the other rooms?

653
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,313
I wanna see
what we can pick up.
Sure.

654
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:52,681
No problem.

655
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,117
Great. Thanks.

656
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,019
Turn 'em on. I just
changed the batteries.

657
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,887
You got it.

658
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:09,198
<i> To be released</i>
<i> and come back--</i>

659
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,970
<i>I have refined the formula</i>
<i>to take us further</i>
<i>to the other side.</i>

660
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:19,108
The venom from
the African black mamba
is a potent neurotoxin.

661
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,878
Mixed with
pancuronium bromide,

662
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,981
which is a lethal agent
used to execute
death row inmates.

663
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,717
Just two drops

664
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,322
will stop the heart
in 60 seconds.

665
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:36,592
After six minutes,
brain death.

666
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:40,028
Without an antidote,
the death rate is 100%.

667
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,764
(murmuring)

668
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:46,201
This is the antidote.

669
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,537
This will bring Jim
back to us.

670
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:53,075
Now, do not,
under any circumstances,

671
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:57,045
administer the antidote
before the full six minutes.

672
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,014
Set the timer, Sam.

673
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:03,786
Long enough
to dance with death,

674
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,355
not so long
as to marry her.

675
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:11,160
(exhales)

676
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,037
He had an antidote.

677
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,375
- Would that even work?
- It could.

678
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,877
If done in time.

679
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:33,449
Jim?

680
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,818
Jim, speak to us.

681
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,121
Jim, speak to us.

682
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,658
- (grunts)
- Oh, my God, Jim.

683
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,627
I don't have
a heartbeat, Karen.
Oh, God.

684
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,329
Jim, come on.

685
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:49,465
- WOMAN:
Give him the antidote now!
- MAN: Use the antidote!

686
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,834
Wait. He said
to wait six minutes.

687
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:53,735
- MAN: Don't wait! Do it now!
- Jim, hang on, okay?

688
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,804
You're so close.

689
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,518
(gasping)

690
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,222
Jim!

691
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:18,327
(coughing)
Jim.

692
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,295
Jim. It's me.

693
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,531
Karen.
It's me. I thought
we lost you.

694
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,600
Karen. Oh, my--

695
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:28,971
My brothers,
we have removed
the second nail.

696
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:31,940
I have been reborn.

697
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,842
- I have been reborn.
- (applause)

698
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:39,381
My brothers, sisters,
I must confess.

699
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:42,551
I'm not strong enough
to go back there on my own.

700
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,389
(video camera beeps)

701
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,794
- Now we know.
- Yeah, he's a fucking psycho.

702
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:55,564
It wasn't suicide.

703
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:58,133
- They had an antidote.
- Why didn't they use it?

704
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,701
Something must
have gone wrong.

705
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:03,539
They didn't plan to die.

706
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,507
Yeah, they all thought
that they were coming back.

707
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,210
Jesus, this is
such a load of shit.

708
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:12,147
Let's see if there's
anything on the mikes.

709
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:18,186
This is from
the living room mike.

710
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:23,525
<i> Oh, my-- My brothers,</i>
<i> we have removed</i>
<i> the second nail.</i>

711
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,160
<i> I have been reborn.</i>

712
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,363
<i> I've been reborn.</i>

713
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,999
This is track two,
dining room.

714
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,676
Three, hallway.

715
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,851
Four, camera room.

716
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,358
<i> (voices whispering)</i>

717
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:01,530
<i> (whispering continues)</i>

718
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:06,868
<i> (faint shrieking,</i>
<i> whispering continues)</i>

719
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,810
Guys, what the fuck
was that?

720
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:16,912
It's haunted!
This place is haunted!

721
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,780
Enough is enough, Maggie.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

722
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,616
We will, I promise.

723
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,384
But we just--
But what, Maggie?

724
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:24,386
Let's just load up
our shit and go.

725
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:26,321
Why are we still
talking about this?

726
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,825
- But we're so close.
- Close? Close to what, Maggie?

727
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,493
We can't leave.

728
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:33,095
(frustrated sigh)

729
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:35,263
What do you think
we should do?

730
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:37,399
You begged me
to come here.

731
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,468
I didn't want to.

732
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:42,704
You said that
we would find answers.

733
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:46,875
Well, now I have actually
seen my family.

734
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:51,947
You can leave.

735
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:55,117
You can all leave,
but I am staying

736
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,686
until I find out why
I was the one who survived.

737
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,192
- Jill, please.
- Maggie, I love you.
I do. I just--

738
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,995
You can keep
all my sound stuff.
I ju--

739
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,232
You know what?
When I get down,
I'll call for some help.

740
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:16,772
Um, you guys are good
with the cameras?

741
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:20,175
- Matt?
- Somebody's gotta go
with her, Maggie.

742
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,414
(sighs)
Shit.

743
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,817
Let's digitize
the rest of the films,

744
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,352
and we'll leave
at sunrise.

745
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,787
CHRISTIAN:
Okay.

746
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:44,766
Okay, I just need
to get this on camera.

747
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:50,038
Have you heard
those voices before?

748
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,575
Why didn't you tell us,
Sarah?

749
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,248
Would you have
believed me?

750
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:03,885
What do you wanna do?

751
01:02:05,656 --> 01:02:08,090
I think we should
talk to them.

752
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:10,092
(beeps)

753
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:14,730
(typing)

754
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:19,634
Okay.

755
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:26,608
Mom.

756
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:31,913
Can you speak to us?

757
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:41,156
I know you're here.

758
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:07,783
<i>(faint whispering)</i>
<i>I'm here.</i>

759
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,152
I'm here.

760
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,122
So talk to me.

761
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:19,628
You wanted me.
Here I am.

762
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,633
(girl's voice)
Bring them to us.

763
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:26,902
I've tried.

764
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:29,971
Sarah. I need you.

765
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,473
(gasps)

766
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:37,479
As soon as I get home,
I'm gonna give my résumé
to the Game Show Network.

767
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,982
You know Maggie.
She's not coming down till she
gets exactly what she wants.

768
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,351
Girl's like a dog
with a bone.
Shit!

769
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:45,153
Jill? Jill?
Hey, wait, wait!

770
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,789
Jill!

771
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,424
(panting)
Where did he go?

772
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,426
Ed?
Where did he go?

773
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:53,495
Oh, my God.

774
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,665
Oh, God.

775
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,170
Matt?
Yeah?

776
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,472
I think maybe--
(gasps)

777
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,441
- (coughs)
- Oh, my God! Ed!

778
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:10,212
Shit! Oh, my gosh!

779
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:13,515
He's gushing blood
from his neck. You gotta hold--
Hold the wound right there.

780
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,952
I'm gonna go get something
out of my bag. Put your hand
here and hold tight, okay?

781
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:18,520
It's okay, Ed.
It's okay.

782
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,691
- Hold it tight, Matt!
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.

783
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,393
- Hurry the fuck up!
- I got it, I got it. Okay.
We're gonna switch.

784
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,996
- One, two, three, go.
- (coughs)

785
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:31,233
I thought he was dead.
Sarah checked him, right?

786
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,802
Look, all that matters
is that we need
to get help.

787
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:36,504
I need you to go
and get the paramedics.
I can handle this.

788
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:38,039
All right?
Okay.

789
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,641
Go!
Okay!

790
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:40,976
Okay.

791
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,811
I need you
to hold this, okay?

792
01:04:42,813 --> 01:04:45,680
Can you put your hand there?
Just gonna get something
to tie it off, okay?

793
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:48,984
- I'll be back.
- (wheezing)

794
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:52,320
Okay. Hang on, Ed.
One second.

795
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,856
Okay.

796
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:58,860
I'm coming.
I'm coming back, all right?
Shit.

797
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:02,197
(gasps, screaming)
Help!

798
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,666
(gasping, screaming)

799
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:08,169
(screaming continues)

800
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:10,505
Stop!

801
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:14,276
Help! Please!

802
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:02,324
(water sloshing)

803
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,124
Sarah!

804
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,826
Sarah!

805
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,697
Sarah!

806
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,033
Where are you?

807
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:53,842
<i> I came back.</i>

808
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,677
<i> Like you asked me to.</i>

809
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,946
<i>Here I am.</i>

810
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:16,064
Sarah!

811
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,787
(low voice whispers)

812
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,929
(voices whispering)

813
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:13,788
(gasps)

814
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,708
Sarah!

815
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,176
Fuck!

816
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,152
Christian.

817
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:46,821
Christian?

818
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:52,360
(projector whirring)

819
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,964
Christian, why didn't
you answer me?

820
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,733
You gotta see this.

821
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:09,477
Jesus was nailed
to the cross.

822
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,647
He wasn't bound.

823
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,649
He was nailed.

824
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:18,953
The spirit

825
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:21,322
is not bound
to the body.

826
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,791
It is nailed.

827
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:26,027
Thank you, my darling.

828
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:29,764
It won't give up
its fleshy domain easily.

829
01:09:31,468 --> 01:09:34,536
But if we release
the nails,

830
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:37,172
we forge a new reality.

831
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:42,377
A deathless world,
a new dawn for mankind.

832
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:49,450
But, Jim, certainly,
the children don't--

833
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:50,919
You know, Karen,

834
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:55,190
in German,
the word for "death"

835
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:56,624
is<i> heimgehen.</i>

836
01:09:57,494 --> 01:10:01,462
It means "going home."

837
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:03,798
What better place
for the children

838
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,668
than at home?

839
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,836
The task that we
have set before us

840
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,905
is one of
the most challenging

841
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:14,475
that any group of human beings
has ever had to face.

842
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:17,579
It is a task
which requires

843
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,981
a perfect faith.

844
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,916
Devotion? No.

845
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,819
A lifetime of devotion
is not enough.

846
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:28,256
One must have
direct experience

847
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:31,492
of the power of spirit.

848
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:34,062
Isn't it curious?

849
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,664
The same tool we use
to pound the nails in,

850
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:39,367
we also use
to draw the nails out.

851
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:41,502
How funny.

852
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,905
(screaming)

853
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,841
I release
the spirit within!

854
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,910
I release the god inside!

855
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:52,413
I give birth to the spirit,
and birth is bloody,

856
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,216
and birth is painful,
and there is blood,

857
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:59,554
and there is pain,
and you are born
into everlasting life!

858
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:01,556
Stop, Jim! Stop it. Sto--

859
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:04,058
Back!
Get back, I say!

860
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,096
Rise up with your spirit
and feel pain no more.

861
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:13,101
And be released
into eternity!

862
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:16,271
Arise!

863
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,877
Arise.

864
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:28,850
(congregation gasping)

865
01:11:32,155 --> 01:11:35,290
Yes. Arise.

866
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,726
Yes!
The third nail's ours.

867
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,296
Ours for the taking!

868
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:44,332
And immortality
is yours, brother.

869
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,668
Forever.

870
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,070
Yes.

871
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,479
Will you follow me?

872
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:04,419
Holy fucking shit.

873
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:06,587
He's not a fake.

874
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,759
- He could really--
- You said we came all this way
for answers.

875
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,862
Shouldn't we finish?

876
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:29,911
Time has come to extract
the last ethereal nail.

877
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:36,918
Time will mean
nothing to us.

878
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:42,857
We'll watch galaxies
spin like pinwheels.

879
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,060
Sam.

880
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,900
Set the timer
to six minutes.

881
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,311
Just a spoonful
of sugar, children.

882
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,755
Now we will all journey
to the other side.

883
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:15,890
I will be your guide.

884
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,060
And since I cannot
bring you all back at once,

885
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:23,698
we will use the antidote
that brought me back
my first time.

886
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,567
And when we return
to our bodies,

887
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,371
we will have a power
without measure,

888
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,540
as you witnessed
within me.

889
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:35,943
And we will use
this power wisely

890
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:41,048
to release every soul
from its mortal coil.

891
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,583
Sam.

01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,686
<i>JIM'S VOICE:</i>
<i>Without death in our lives,</i>

893

<i>there's no need for fear.</i>

894

Children.

895
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:52,894
No! No.
Give me the cubes.
Give them to me.

896
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:55,196
Don't put them
in your mouth.
Don't eat them.

897
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,467
Sister. Sister.

898
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,436
Be calm, sister.

899
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,738
Tormented and frightened
is your soul.

900
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:07,108
Please don't do this
to our children, Jim.

901
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,709
You're their father.

902
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,346
Jim's your dad.

903
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,218
Should we abandon
our path?

904
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,920
ALL:
No! No.

905
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:23,424
How many times
must I die for you, Karen?

906
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:25,526
Please, Jim, I'm scared.

907

Kids, don't eat them.
No, Jim!

Children, I love you.

01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:47,515
Now, do as I say.

914
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:49,150
No! Kids, don't do it.

Kids, don't eat them.

Jim, stop.
No, kids, don't eat them.

Sam,
get the antidote ready!

01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:58,493
- No!
- Silence!

Sam!
Continue, children.

920
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,433
Jim, no! No!

921

We don't have to do this!

- Return!
- (congregation gasping)

923
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:16,711
Now, Mama, please.
Mama, please, please
don't do this.

924
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:19,380
Don't do this.
There's nothing to death.

925
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,716
It's just a crossing over
to another plane.

926
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:24,218
Please, Mama, please.

927
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:31,626
We shall all rise up,

928
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:36,898
and we will rub the dust
of a thousand years
from our eyes.

929
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,600
Sarah, come on.

930
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:44,071
Jim!
She's getting away!

931
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:46,541
Sarah, run and hide!
Run!

01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:48,042
Hide!

Jim!

934
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:53,014
Those who will not follow
shall be carried.

No!

01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:05,326
This is my body.

939
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:07,395
This is my blood.

940
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,096
No!

941
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:12,833
Shh.

942
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:15,169
She is the flame of life,

943
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:17,238
the power of darkness.

944
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,241
Let her go.

You'll rise.
You'll rise again.
Please.

Rise, children!
Get up and put your hands

Your hands where
we can see 'em!

What have you done?

972
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:24,999
What have<i> you</i> done, sir?

You think you bar the way?

01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,704
You only inflame my wrath!

Your children!

You all will be subsumed!

The FBI agent--

01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,531
That was my dad.

983
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:35,269
He was the one that--

Who let
all those people die.

All of them.

None of them--
No.

988

Wait for me.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

New vessels

1000

now laid upon the children.

get out of here.

- Christian's gone, Maggie.

You'll see.

1012
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:59,914
After all,

1013
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:03,117
who wouldn't want
everlasting life?

1014
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:06,587

Aaah!

1015
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,322
Get the fuck off me!

No! Please, no!

1017

1026
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:17,251

01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:23,343
We have been remade
by Yaldabaoth

1048
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,846
in the image
of the Seven Archons

1049
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:30,350
who created and enslaved
this world.

1050
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,020
We are the hidden masters.

1051
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:36,223
We are the architects
of anarchy.

1052
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:42,162
We are the dark
fucking soul eaters,

1053
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:44,865
lords of the unrighteous.

1054
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:47,634
Today our new reign

1055
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:50,704
begins in a new reality!

1056
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,540
I told you!
I told you!

1057
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:57,377
I told you
we'd be deathless!

1058
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:02,182
We just, uh, need new shells
from time to time

1059
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:04,985
and plenty of souls to eat.

1060
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:09,523
Our legion will rise

1061
01:27:09,525 --> 01:27:11,658
from behind the veil

1062
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:15,028
to reap the pain
that we have wrought!

1063
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:18,865
The Seven shall become
a vast multitude.

1064
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:22,769
These are the days
of vengeance and wrath!

1065
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:27,274
The deathless eon
has begun!

1066
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,411
It's a beautiful day.
