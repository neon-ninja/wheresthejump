1
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,292
Ma.

2
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,667
That's it.

3
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,208
Mama.

4
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,167
Kay?

5
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey!

6
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,208
Hello!

7
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,708
Hey.

8
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,208
So we have three meals.

9
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,625
Four at a stretch.

10
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,792
Okay.

11
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,625
So that means
we're down to quarter rations.

12
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,042
Okay.

13
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,542
Is there a plan I'm not aware of?
Want to fill me in on it?

14
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,333
- No, I like your plan.
- Which is?

15
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,375
That we eat the pens.

16
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,417
Look, there's a town here.

17
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,917
Can't be more than
30 or 40 km from where we are.

18
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,292
Right? It's rural.
There's not a lot of people.

19
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,833
I say we get a car, fill it with supplies,
we just see what's out there.

20
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,417
- We've seen what's out there.
- We've seen what's back there. Weeks ago.

21
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,208
- It's quiet on the banks...
- We talked about this.

22
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,500
- What if we've outrun it?
- What if we haven't?

23
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,917
Where we need to be, actually, is here.

24
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,042
The river has got us this far.

25
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,958
If we play it smart, it'll get us there,
but we have to stick to what we know.

26
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:47,958
What we know? You had barely set foot
on a boat before we found this thing.

27
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,458
I mean,
it's older than both of us put together.

28
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,792
What if the engine goes?
What happens then?

29
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,375
We have to think about Rosie.

30
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:58,042
Do we? I hadn't thought of that.
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

31
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,083
Look, we can't set foot on the shore
until it is our last and only option.

32
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,083
That's just the way it is, I'm sorry.

33
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,625
So is that going to be before or after
our daughter starves to death?

34
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,875
Shh.

35
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,125
Jesus Christ.

36
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
My God.

37
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,083
Wow.

38
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,708
- Any bites?
- Um-mm. Not yet.

39
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,667
- Oh, hang on a second.
- Quick. Hook him with the thing.

40
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,500
- What, with the hook? Whoa.
- Yeah, bring him in, quick!

41
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,500
- What?
- What's that?

42
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,375
- Where did you get this from?
- From the wrecked yacht.

43
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,708
Say thank you. Look at this.

44
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,125
There's enough there
for three months, at least.

45
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,042
- Hey, this is good news, Blue.
- It's great news.

46
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,792
You're not worried. It was a one-man job.

47
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,542
In and out. Easy. Safe.

48
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,750
Come on, this is a win, Blue.
This is a win.

49
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,042
We must celebrate those

50
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,833
- when they come along, just a little bit.
- No, okay.

51
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,833
- You sure it was safe?
- Safe.

52
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,167
Is there a razor in that stash of yours?

53
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,792
Why? I'll have you know, this is rugged.

54
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,625
- I think it's a bit ragged.
- Rugged.

55
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,708
Rugged.

56
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,792
How is she? How is little monkey?

57
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,208
She's been down a while.

58
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,792
Maybe you should go say hello.

59
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,125
I'm not sure she'd like that much.

60
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,667
Hey, go and have a lie down.

61
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,167
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Go.

62
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,417
Man.

63
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,375
- You are.
- Woman.

64
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,542
Good girl, Rosie. Yes.

65
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,083
Yes.

66
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,917
Okay.

67
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,208
Oh!

68
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,250
Hey.

69
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,792
- Mama.
- Hey, darling. Okay, all right.

70
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,625
Ohh!

71
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,917
Mommy.

72
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,250
Where's Mommy then?

73
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,958
Where is she?

74
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,292
Kay?

75
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,125
Kay?
Are you in there?

76
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,083
Kay! Come on, let me in, babe.

77
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:26,958
Let me in.

78
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,333
Shit, Kay, what...

79
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,042
What have you done?

80
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,917
- No, don't...
- Let me see.

81
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,625
- No.
- Well, keep pressure on it.

82
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,917
- Mama.
- It's all right. It's okay.

83
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,917
Oh, shit.

84
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,542
Come on, let me see.

85
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,375
Oh, fuck.

86
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,667
Right, Kay, just...

87
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,958
Oh, what have you done?

88
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,500
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- It's all right. It's okay.

89
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,750
All right, keep that pressure on it.
Keep pressure on.

90
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,625
Shit.

91
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,500
- Okay. All right? You okay?
- Yeah.

92
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,708
All right? Look at me.

93
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,250
- It's okay.
- It's going to be okay.

94
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,958
Hey.

95
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,708
- So talk to me. What are you thinking?
- Well, we can't stay here.

96
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,917
But it's only been an hour.
Symptoms take at least three hours to...

97
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,750
Yeah, I know how it works.
We might not have that time.

98
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,917
- We can't take the risk.
- Oh, so today it's a risk.

99
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,750
Out there, with this?
Yes, it's a risk.

100
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,500
Let's not put Rosie in danger
till we know what we're dealing with.

101
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,417
There are dozens of things
that live and eat in this river.

102
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,167
- We have no idea what bit you.
- It had fingers, Andy.

103
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,833
Fuck!

104
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,250
Look, if you are sick,
then you've got 48 hours,

105
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,750
and we'll deal with that.

106
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,500
But if you're wrong, right,
and you're not infected,

107
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,583
then at the rate you're bleeding,
you've got two hours, three, tops.

108
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,167
That's a risk I'm not gonna take.

109
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,500
We need to get to the hospital,
where you said.

110
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,042
Someone will patch you up
and we'll hedge our bets.

111
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,250
What if we lose?

112
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,625
What if we lose?

113
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,500
It's gonna be my call.

114
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,292
Yeah.

115
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,792
Come on.

116
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,958
Don't look.

117
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,000
Come on, little darling.

118
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,333
Okay.

119
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,083
Oh, good girl. Come here.

120
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,083
Put you in here for a minute. There we go.

121
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,625
Come on.

122
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,708
Oh, you beauty.

123
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,750
Right.

124
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,083
Just like that.

125
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,875
- Come here.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

126
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,500
Come here.
I just need you in the car, all right?

127
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,292
Impossible.

128
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,500
I'll get in. Have a fiddle around with it.

129
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,917
Okay, I'll be two secs.

130
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,042
Right.

131
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,625
There you are, poppet.

132
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,958
There, the new mobile's sorted for you.

133
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,500
Mama's here.

134
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,500
Good girl.

135
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,250
Go!

136
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,500
How're you feeling?

137
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,583
Like me.

138
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,542
Good.

139
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:20,958
Hey, monkey, what is it, darling?

140
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,750
She needs a change.

141
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,292
- I'll do it.
- No, it's fine.

142
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,667
She'll make less fuss.

143
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,875
- 'Course she will.
- Come on, stinky trunks.

144
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,167
Let's get you cleaned up.

145
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,958
There we go.

146
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,167
Hey!

147
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,542
Eww!

148
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,125
Hey, Rosie posie.

149
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,333
Kay!

150
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,000
Hey, Rosie.

151
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,458
Kay, give me your head.

152
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,875
All right. Shh...

153
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,667
Shh.

154
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,000
- Kay? Just breathe.
- Stop the car.

155
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,667
- Look at me now.
- Stop the car!

156
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,167
- We need to keep calm...
- Let me out now!

157
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,708
Jesus! Wait!

158
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,417
Christ!

159
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,167
Kay.

160
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,083
Kay.

161
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,625
Hey, listen. Will you just...

162
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,208
Fuckin' don't touch me!

163
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,167
Andy, you can't control this.

164
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,208
You don't fucking keep this from me!

165
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:44,042
How long were you going to play along for?
What, until I turn on you?

166
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,625
- On her?
- No.

167
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,333
- You must take her.
- What?

168
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,667
- What are you talking about? Leaving you?
- You must take her.

169
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,375
Stop. Just stop.

170
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,750
Come on.

171
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,708
I'm here, all right?

172
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,625
It'll be all right.

173
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,167
Come on, let's get you up.

174
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,542
We're not going to the hospital.

175
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,542
We are so close.

176
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,500
It puts you and Rosie
further from the river.

177
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,417
There's nothing there for us now.

178
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,083
Yeah there is. Time is there. See this?

179
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,458
That's yours. All of it, every second,
and we're gonna make it count.

180
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,750
But if you bleed out, you'll turn sooner.

181
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,458
It's my call, remember?

182
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:53,167
So I get no say in that?
I don't have a choice?

183
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,833
No, sweetheart, you don't.

184
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,458
Kay.

185
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,250
I can't do that.

186
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,667
Watch the leg.

187
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,458
Shit!

188
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:10,917
Kay?

189
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:15,958
Rosie?

190
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,750
Hey, how're we doing?

191
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,458
Rosie? Rose.

192
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,083
Kay.

193
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,417
Hey.

194
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,583
Blue?

195
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:49,833
Rosie!

196
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:50,875
Fuck!

197
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,875
Oh, fuck!

198
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:55,875
They're coming.

199
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,417
I need you to be a very good girl.
Stay here.

200
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,667
Nice and calm for Daddy.

201
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,542
And he'll be right back.
Hey, Rosie? Be right back.

202
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,333
Oh.

203
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:18,542
No. No.

204
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,792
Mmm? It's all right.

205
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,167
I know what you like.

206
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,042
Umm.

207
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,583
Hey, Rosie.

208
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:41,708
It's Mommy.

209
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,000
I can smell Mommy.

210
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,708
I can smell Mommy too.

211
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,667
Hey.

212
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,417
Hey!

213
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,333
Do you know what you just did?

214
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,000
You stay away. Stay back.

215
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,542
Leave my dad alone!

216
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,167
What's the count left on that business?

217
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,000
Uh...

218
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:47,000
It's 46 hours, give or take.

219
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:49,792
Sit.

220
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,292
Give us your arm.

221
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,667
Won't do much, I'm afraid.

222
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,708
But it might help you hide it.

223
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,625
Best to do that around these parts.

224
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,000
It's all right, darling.

225
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,292
Who's this then?

226
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,458
It's Rosie.

227
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:40,375
- Mama.
- Little flower.

228
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,125
Folks call me Etta.

229
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,292
Andy.

230
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,583
This place looked bigger on the map.

231
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,625
- We never fail to disappoint.
- The hospital, is it...

232
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,667
That's a generous description.
It's the next building over.

233
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,458
There's not much left.
They cut our funding years back.

234
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,667
Are you a teacher?

235
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:06,958
I was.

236
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,917
Where are they now, your students?

237
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Gone.

238
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,125
I'm sorry.

239
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:17,083
No, not dead. Gone.
Living in the old ways.

240
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,125
Nothing to be sorry about.
They're doing better than the rest of us.

241
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,125
Mobs from all over the country
coming together.

242
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:27,250
They sensed it,
those who stayed connected.

243
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:33,208
The whole community
up and left back to their country.

244
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,792
There's a spare bed if you want one.

245
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,292
What do you think, Rosie?
Do we like her?

246
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,458
Do we like her?

247
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,792
I think we might like her.

248
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,375
Okay.

249
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,708
Thoomi!

250
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,958
Thoomi!

251
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,375
Thoomi!

252
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,750
<i>Come home!</i>

253
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,583
Shh.

254
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,417
Shh.

255
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,583
- <i>what are we gonna do with this?
- Make spears?</i>

256
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,500
Bit like Mom's spaghetti, eh?

257
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:40,583
Dad!

258
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,792
Back in the old days,
we used to take this from an animal.

259
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,625
Mr. Clever Man!

260
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,708
They're poisoning this land,
you know?

261
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,000
This country, changing.

262
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,833
It's sick.

263
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,375
We all get sick.

264
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,708
You get sick too.

265
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,417
Yeah.

266
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,542
Hey, Etta.

267
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,875
You can't do that. You can't lose hope.

268
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,625
This is Willie Bell.

269
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:23,500
He's a good man. A friend.
His daughter Thoomi was one of mine.

270
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,167
Smart as a whip.

271
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,583
- Her daddy's shadow.
- Yeah, I've seen them.

272
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:33,583
Well, you just head right back
and tell Willie that Etta sent you.

273
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:36,292
If you want to give this baby
a second chance,

274
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,792
that's where you go.

275
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,083
Yeah?

276
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,000
Thanks.

277
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,292
- Have you seen the fires?
- Yeah.

278
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:48,375
Hunting parties are cleansing the land
of the sick ones. You just stay away.

279
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,667
Hey, Rosie.

280
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,667
Bye bye, darling. Bye bye.

281
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,583
Bye bye.

282
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,333
Now you take care.

283
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,333
Hello, what's here?

284
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:14,583
Let's give you some water, darling.

285
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,458
That's mine.

286
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,042
Fuck.

287
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,042
Army base is overrun.

288
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:15,625
There'll be more.

289
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,083
They would have heard that shot for miles.

290
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,417
Better keep that baby quiet too.

291
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,875
Listen, how about you get me out of here
and then I'll get you out of here?

292
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,000
To where?

293
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:30,292
A place you could hole up for a bit.

294
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:35,500
The little one, be real nice
for the wife to have that around.

295
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:43,958
You better think fast. Tow it off me.

296
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,042
Shit.

297
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,750
- Come on.
- Got the keys?

298
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,458
Don't you fuck me.

299
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,500
Good man. Take this.

300
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:07,667
Come on. Let's go.

301
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,417
Flagged me down on the highway,
this bloke.

302
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,708
Put himself in a spot with some diggers.

303
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:24,208
Hello.

304
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,625
Hello.

305
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,042
Attagirl. Close your eyes.

306
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:41,333
It's nice.

307
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,042
No, it's beautiful.

308
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,333
Rainey'll get you settled.

309
00:44:57,542 --> 00:44:59,250
Do you mind if I put her down?

310
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,167
He doesn't bring people back.

311
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,917
Well, we're very glad
he made an exception, aren't we?

312
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,125
Thanks.

313
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,583
- That's why we're here.
- What, the gas?

314
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:43,417
Vic has plans
for when things get back to normal.

315
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,667
It's not going to happen. Is it?

316
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,500
I don't think normal is on the horizon.

317
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,708
You worked on the lines?

318
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,500
In the canteen.

319
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:00,792
I cooked.

320
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,875
Right, well,
that's the most important job of all.

321
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,875
Men must have loved you.

322
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:07,958
One did.

323
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,875
You're the first people I've seen.

324
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:23,250
The first people who are still people.

325
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,708
Yeah.

326
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,458
All right, mate, let's go.

327
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,958
They've only just arrived, Vic.

328
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,000
Well, if he's in, he's all the way in.

329
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,458
Rainey'll look after her.
Take her up there, cuddle her.

330
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,083
Won't even notice you're gone.

331
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:50,250
I'll keep her safe.

332
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:54,917
Great.

333
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:58,708
Please look after her.

334
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:00,333
Okay.

335
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,125
Come on, Rosie. This is...

336
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,667
- You okay?
- Mama!

337
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,917
Yes.

338
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Hey.

339
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,292
This calms her down.

340
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,042
Okay.

341
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:16,667
- All right...
- See you soon.

342
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,750
Yeah.

343
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,833
Yeah.

344
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,750
Vic.

345
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,875
What's this?

346
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,000
Ever used one of these?

347
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:47,750
No.

348
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:53,958
Move forward.

349
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:55,292
Stand forty-five.

350
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,750
Forty-five degrees to the target.

351
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,875
Now move the stock into your shoulder...

352
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:01,417
We're going to shoot them?

353
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:03,333
Yeah.

354
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:07,667
You're not gonna kiss 'em, are ya?
Now cheek to the cheek plate.

355
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,042
If the target's blurry,
you're doing it right.

356
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,917
- Yeah?
- You got it?

357
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,708
- Uh, I'm not sure. I think so.
- Squeeze the trigger but don't pull it.

358
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:17,083
- Really?
- Yeah.

359
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:20,792
If you pull it, then you throw
your sights out. So back up.

360
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,542
Now squeeze.

361
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:26,083
Feel the resistance. Squeeze...

362
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:29,167
All right.

363
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:35,167
Now keep shooting till you drop him...
and don't stop till we got 'em all.

364
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,708
Come on, I can't carry you, mate.

365
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,250
I thought we were here for gas.

366
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:26,375
- Call it a side earner.
- What's that got to do with her?

367
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:28,917
Can't catch a fish without bait.

368
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,792
When this country gets back on track,
people are gonna want things.

369
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,542
Whoever controls the market, power, gas...

370
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,333
all the shiny shit...
will be sitting pretty.

371
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,292
I'm just making hay while the sun shines.

372
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,042
The sun's not shining, Vic.

373
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,667
What's it worth to ya?

374
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,042
A safe place for you and your kid?

375
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,792
Only girl you need to be worried about
is your own.

376
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:07,917
Fill it up.

377
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:28,875
Hey, it's okay.

378
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:32,083
No, just low on gas, that's all.

379
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:33,542
Just low on gas.

380
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,208
Shh.

381
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,625
Hey, Rosie.

382
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:11,583
I told you mob.

383
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,667
The wells are mine
along with what's in 'em.

384
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,417
Fuck with me...

385
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:31,917
...and I'll fuck with you.

386
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,750
You look lonely in there.

387
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:44,417
See if we can drum you up some company.

388
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:23,958
She's sleeping.

389
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,417
You did well today.

390
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:51,167
Maybe we can talk about
you staying on permanent.

391
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:55,625
I cleaned her up.

392
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:31,542
Oop.

393
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,625
Come on. You're all right. Come on.

394
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,417
Oh.

395
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,875
Hey, Rosie.

396
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,042
I love you.

397
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:29,500
Come on, you fucker.

398
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:32,375
Come on, you fucker.

399
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:35,875
Please don't.

400
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:40,958
Lorraine.

401
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:42,708
You shouldn't be here.

402
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,958
I know what you're doing, and I know why.

403
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,667
Please, just look after her for me.

404
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,792
I will.

405
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,417
But not here.

406
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,333
- Lorraine, this is as safe as it gets.
- Not from him.

407
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:58,417
- What's your count?
- It's around 20.

408
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,000
- Take us somewhere else.
- He is not perfect, but here it's secure.

409
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,042
- Your husband...
- He's not my husband.

410
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,375
That man left my husband to die
at the gas plant with everyone else.

411
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:10,250
Locked them in to save his own skin.

412
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:14,417
I could protect this little girl
more than he ever will.

413
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,167
But not here.

414
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:32,250
There is a family by the river.
I don't know if they're still alive.

415
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,875
- I don't know if we can make it in time.
- This looks cozy.

416
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:43,333
If I didn't know better, I'd think
you were trying to steal my girl, Andy.

417
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:44,667
You do know better.

418
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,125
Rosie!

419
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,625
Vic!

420
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:52,292
Come on, let me out, you fuck!
I'm not going to hurt you.

421
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,083
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

422
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,500
Okay, come with me.
I need to have a look at this.

423
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:03,042
God, look, I'm not going to hurt you,
I promise you.

424
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:06,500
When I saw you...
when I saw you yesterday...

425
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,208
I'm sorry about that.
You can be mad at me.

426
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:11,708
If you want out, I'm your ticket.
Let's play ball.

427
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,833
Do you want to see your friend?

428
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:17,417
He's not my friend.
I just want my daughter back.

429
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:21,667
- I want something too.
- What do you want?

430
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,833
His keys to the Clever Man's cage.

431
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:26,750
Whatever that is, you can have 'em.

432
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,542
- They're coming.
- Huh?

433
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,667
The ghosts. They smell it.

434
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,250
Come on.

435
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,083
Shit.

436
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,167
When this lifts up,
you gotta slide out straight away.

437
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:53,958
Come on. That's it.

438
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:01,042
Come on! That's it! Let's go!

439
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,458
Go!

440
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:39,542
Here, Lorraine, give her to me.

441
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,375
Fucking thief!

442
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:44,458
Get back here!

443
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:46,083
- Andy!
- No!

444
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,458
Vic, no!

445
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,833
Rainey!

446
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,958
Rainey!

447
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,375
He's gone.

448
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,833
Come on, let's go.

449
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:10,417
Wait.

450
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:20,083
I can smell your rot, you weasly cunt!

451
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,500
- What you took didn't belong to you!
- Shit.

452
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:37,958
You give me back the fucking black bitch!

453
01:03:38,917 --> 01:03:39,917
She's mine!

454
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:45,167
If you give her to me, then maybe
there'll be a happy ending for your kid!

455
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:48,542
But if I have to fucking come looking,

456
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,167
then it'll be bad for you
and worse for them.

457
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:55,625
Shh.

458
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:03,208
Maybe I'll just wait
a couple of days, huh?

459
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:07,000
Until you're not you anymore.

460
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:10,333
And I'll just watch...

461
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:14,167
while you eat their fucking faces off.

462
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,208
Good girl.

463
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:09,667
Thoomi, I need to get back to the river.
Can you show me the way?

464
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,333
I've gotta find the Clever Man.

465
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:15,292
Oh, look, I don't have time for...
What is a Clever Man, anyway?

466
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,458
Is he just a smart guy, or what?

467
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,958
He's a magic man.

468
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,500
If you're sick,
he can give you good medicine.

469
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:28,875
And if someone steals your spirit away,
he can put it back again.

470
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:33,792
Hey, you think your dad is acting
the way he is because he lost his soul?

471
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,250
There are lots of people
walking around like your dad.

472
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:40,833
- My dad's different.
- I don't think that's true.

473
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,833
There's no fixing
what your father and I have.

474
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,792
Lots of other smart guys have tried.

475
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:52,667
Where are you going?

476
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,458
I've gotta check something.

477
01:06:55,042 --> 01:06:56,333
Check what?

478
01:06:56,417 --> 01:06:58,042
Thoomi, check what?

479
01:06:58,625 --> 01:06:59,917
For fuck's sake.

480
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:37,458
Jesus, Thoomi.

481
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:38,542
Hey, stop!

482
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:39,833
Go away!

483
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:43,125
This is sorry business.
You're just a stupid<i> gubba.</i>

484
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,542
You don't know anything.

485
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,000
That's my dad.

486
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:59,750
We get buried in the trees
so the ghosts can't wake us.

487
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,833
His spirit's still loose.

488
01:09:03,917 --> 01:09:04,958
It's my fault.

489
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:06,833
I took too long.

490
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,042
No you didn't.

491
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:12,875
No you didn't. This isn't your fault.

492
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:15,833
I tied him here till I could bring
the Clever Man back.

493
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:17,708
They weren't supposed to find him.

494
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,375
They thought
they were doing the right thing.

495
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:22,875
They did.

496
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:26,375
That wasn't your dad anymore.

497
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,583
I'm sorry, but it wasn't.

498
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:34,375
I should have been here,
with him, not you.

499
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,792
Thoomi, I have to go. I'm sorry.

500
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:49,542
I think Rosie would like it
if you came with us.

501
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,375
I'd be happier if you did.

502
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:55,667
I don't care about you or your baby.

503
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,917
I don't think you mean that.

504
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,167
She'll be okay.

505
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:19,167
She'll be okay. Shit.

506
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,125
Shit.

507
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,083
Rosie?

508
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,292
River's this way.

509
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,625
What's with the leaves?

510
01:13:08,042 --> 01:13:09,750
They hide my footprints.

511
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,250
From who? The ghosts?

512
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:14,875
No, my mom.

513
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,500
Hello?

514
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:30,667
Hungry?

515
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:51,083
Yes.

516
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,750
Bingo.

517
01:13:55,792 --> 01:13:58,042
This might sting a little bit.

518
01:13:58,667 --> 01:13:59,625
Where is it?

519
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,458
There? Ready?

520
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,625
Why'd you do that?

521
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:10,792
It's from the old ways.

522
01:14:12,042 --> 01:14:13,375
But not our ways anymore.

523
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:14,958
Then why?

524
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:17,667
'Cause it hurts.

525
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:21,333
When this hurt heals,
maybe this hurt heals too.

526
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:26,792
Where did all the people go?

527
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,958
Not far.

528
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:31,750
The food's still fresh.

529
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,958
Why do you want 'em?

530
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,250
'Cause I want to ask them a favor.

531
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,667
About bub? Are they gonna keep her?

532
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:41,500
We should think about
what we're gonna do with you.

533
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,125
Maybe they won't come back.

534
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,417
I think they will.

535
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,708
What if they don't?

536
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:51,083
Then you're all I've got.

537
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:43,917
Hello?

538
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:53,250
The caravan's yours.

539
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,333
Car too, if you can start it.

540
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:58,542
It's not the car I need.

541
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,042
Look.

542
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,542
I've got six, okay?

543
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,125
The last two are yours,
if you go that way.

544
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:28,375
- Please, don't do that.
- I can't leave them.

545
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,083
I said I wouldn't and I won't, so...

546
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:35,792
Hey.

547
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:40,042
Look, Daddy, that man has a baby!

548
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:42,125
Yes, he does.

549
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:46,958
Should we say goodbye to the baby?

550
01:16:47,042 --> 01:16:48,333
Yeah.

551
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,958
They're leaving now.

552
01:16:50,042 --> 01:16:52,125
Bye bye, baby!

553
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,125
Hey, mate.

554
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:01,250
Just take the two.

555
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:02,917
For her sake.

556
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,792
Where's my pirate, ey?

557
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:19,625
We gonna come
and find this treasure?

558
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:20,833
Hey? Come on.

559
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:53,500
Dad.

560
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,250
Daddy.

561
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:05,875
Come here, Rosie.

562
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,250
Hey, Thoomi.

563
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,333
Hey.

564
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,292
Hey.

565
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,500
What's happened to your leaves?

566
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:24,958
I wanna go home now.

567
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:26,917
Really?

568
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:30,375
You want my people?

569
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:33,542
Yeah.

570
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:35,750
Yeah, I do.

571
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:44,000
Thoomi, if I don't make
it to the hills, you...

572
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,917
- You don't have to. See?
- Hmm?

573
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:49,208
They're close.

574
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:51,250
<i>Atla.</i>

575
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:54,917
Fire.

576
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,083
<i>Atla.</i>

577
01:19:58,958 --> 01:19:59,958
Say<i> atla.</i>

578
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:02,833
Okay.

579
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,917
- What's that?
- Makes it so the ghosts can't track us.

580
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:11,750
Really?

581
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:14,708
- I'd better put some on.
- You don't need any.

582
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:16,542
You smell like them already.

583
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,375
Proper creepy in there.

584
01:20:57,917 --> 01:20:59,667
Proper creepy out there too.

585
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:31,583
They're hibernating.
They need the dark.

586
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,500
Vic!

587
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:32,708
You fuck!

588
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,958
Get the fuck outta there.

589
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,417
Get out!

590
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,542
Don't! Stop!

591
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,958
Shh.

592
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,917
Shh.

593
01:24:28,792 --> 01:24:31,250
Thoomi! You all right?

594
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:33,333
Oh, God. Where's Rosie?

595
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,667
Where's Rosie?

596
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:45,083
It's all right.

597
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:47,958
Rosie.

598
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,333
Shh.

599
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:00,708
Give her to me, Vic.

600
01:25:02,292 --> 01:25:03,417
Come on, mate.

601
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:06,208
We're both fucked.

602
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,792
Vic, I swear to Christ.

603
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:13,958
If you hurt her...

604
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,167
You took mine, now, I take yours.

605
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:23,958
Lorraine wasn't yours though, Vic.

606
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:37,417
Vic, don't...

607
01:25:38,292 --> 01:25:39,625
Don't you dare.

608
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:41,875
Listen to me, Vic.

609
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:44,292
It's done.

610
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:52,375
All right. All right, darling.

611
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:53,458
All right, darling.

612
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,208
Thoomi?

613
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:17,125
I know you're hurt, darling.

614
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,542
Stay with me.

615
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:21,833
Thoomi.

616
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:23,042
Thoomi, please.

617
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:25,708
We can't go any further
if you don't walk, okay?

618
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,958
Do you understand me?

619
01:26:27,417 --> 01:26:29,458
Thoomi, wake up. Wake up, darling.

620
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:31,917
Are you gonna help me?

621
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:34,542
Let's help each other, yeah?

622
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,042
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

623
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:43,042
Teach me some of those words, mate.
Teach me how to say, "sun".

624
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:44,708
Hmm?

625
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:46,458
Teach me how to say "sky", then.

626
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:48,958
Christ, teach me something.

627
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,458
Teach me how to say "daddy".
How do you say that?

628
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,125
<i>- Vapi.
- Vapi.</i> Great.

629
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:56,583
How do you say "daughter"?

630
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:58,792
<i>- Vapalu.</i>
- Yeah!

631
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:02,083
How do you say...
What's that word you called me?

632
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:04,333
<i>Gubba.</i> What was that? What does that mean?

633
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:05,833
- White fella.
- White fella.

634
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:08,750
White fella.

635
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:12,333
Well, how do you say "friend"?

636
01:27:13,292 --> 01:27:14,667
<i>- Mita.
- Mita.</i>

637
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,792
Yeah,<i> mita.</i>

638
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,250
I prefer that one.

639
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:43,250
Stop.

640
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:48,042
Come here.

641
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:50,333
Okay.

642
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:52,208
Let go.

643
01:27:52,292 --> 01:27:54,625
Come. Help me.

644
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:56,125
Help me.

645
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:58,625
Hold onto her.

646
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,417
Hold onto her.

647
01:29:07,792 --> 01:29:11,042
- Oh, shit.
- Stay close or they'll smell us.

648
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,083
See?

649
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:14,375
My paint's coming off.

650
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:48,167
Take it.

651
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,125
Take it away.

652
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:52,417
Take it away.

653
01:30:04,792 --> 01:30:05,833
Okay.

654
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:08,750
Now don't worry about this.

655
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:14,167
You just treat this
like it's mom's spaghetti, okay?

656
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:16,708
All right.

657
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:20,125
Look after her for me, okay?
'Cause I'm going now.

658
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:22,500
Look after her.
Will you do that for me,<i> mita?</i>

659
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:26,167
- I will.
- All right, mate.

660
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,042
- I promise.
- Thank you.

661
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:32,625
Hey.

662
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:34,458
Hey, Rosie, you're in good hands.

663
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:37,208
You're in good hands.
She's gonna look after you, mate.

664
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:39,083
I love you.

665
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:42,958
Love you.

666
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:07,625
Thoomi. Thoomi, now.

667
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:09,125
Now.
