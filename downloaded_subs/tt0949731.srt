1
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,373
I forgot where I am.

2
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,076
You're at the place
where the killers meet

3
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,313
to decide what to do
with the crippled girl.

4
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,822
Oh, that's right. That's right.

5
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,229
Did you hear that?

6
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,393
That's funny.

7
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:03,874
That's weird. Those people look 
like they're clawing at themselves.

8
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,404
Is that blood?

9
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,428
Claire, are you seeing this?

10
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,866
Claire.

11
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,567
Claire?

12
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,571
Claire?

13
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,634
What page was I on?

14
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,716
Page.

15
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,372
- I need an extension over here.
- Fall back. Fall back.

16
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,606
You kidding me?
Like another 20 feet.

17
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,274
Don't touch that.
That's for the drywall guys.

18
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,543
I told you he wouldn't do it!

19
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,142
So then the little guy says,

20
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,747
"You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too?
Well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY'."

21
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:30,124
The big guy says, "No, man, mine says,
'Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."'

22
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,435
Christ, McKenzie fell.

23
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,448
Medic, we have a major accident
at the south side of the building.

24
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,577
- We'll need an ambulance.
<i>- Copy.</i>

25
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,253
Jesus.

26
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,924
Give him some room.

27
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,621
- Hey!
- Somebody fell!

28
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,859
- Davis?
- Oh, my God, he just fell!

29
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,459
Someone fell! Over that building!

30
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,433
Oh, my God!

31
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,601
- Watch it.
- Oh, my God!

32
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,542
Watch it. Get out of there!

33
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,476
- Help!
- Look out!

34
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,786
Look out!

35
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,796
God in heaven.

36
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,536
Look, I don't know if you guys
have heard about this article

37
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,538
in <i>The New York Times</i>
about honeybees vanishing?

38
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,001
Well, apparently, honeybees are 
disappearing all over the country.

39
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,370
Tens of millions of them.
Just disappearing.

40
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,972
There's no bodies, no sign of them.
They're just mysteriously gone.

41
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,143
It's scary, huh?

42
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,656
All right, let's hear some theories
about why this might be happening.

43
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,885
Nothing? Come on, guys.

44
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,659
- Laura.
- Disease?

45
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,665
Right. Could be a virus or infection.

46
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,634
But it's all over the country.
It's a coordinated event in 24 states.

47
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,170
It's a little tricky.

48
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,728
- Pollution?
- Could be.

49
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,240
I mean, we're just pumping
so much junk into the environment

50
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,969
they're just keeling over.

51
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,207
But there are no bodies. Keep guessing.

52
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,804
Dylan.

53
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,146
Global warming.

54
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,018
Temperature goes up a fraction of a 
degree, makes them disoriented?

55
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,350
Maybe.

56
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,254
Jake?

57
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,822
You don't have an opinion?

58
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,099
You're not interested
in what happened to the bees?

59
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,697
You should be more interested
in science, Jake.

60
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,434
You know why?
Because your face is perfect.

61
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,273
The problem is,
your face is perfect at 15.

62
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,505
Now, if you were interested in science,
you would know facts

63
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,709
like the human nose and ears
grow a fraction of an inch each year.

64
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,274
So a perfect balance of features now

65
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,910
might not look so perfect
five years from now.

66
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,479
They might look downright whack
10 years from now.

67
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,353
Come on, buddy.
Take an interest in science.

68
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,557
What could be a reason
the bees have vanished?

69
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,696
An act of nature and 
we'll never fully understand it.

70
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,003
Nice answer, Jake.

71
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,600
He's right.

72
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,703
I mean, science will come up
with some reason to put in the books,

73
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,112
but in the end, it'll be just a theory.

74
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:42,415
We will fail to acknowledge that there are
forces at work beyond our understanding.

75
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,387
To be a good scientist,

76
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,086
you must have a respectful awe
for the laws of nature.

77
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,286
Jake?

78
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,386
How much does the human nose
grow each year?

79
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,022
- Oh, man.
- It's minuscule, buddy, okay?

80
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,363
Don't worry about it. You're gonna
be a heartthrob your whole life.

81
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,698
I was just messing with you.

82
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,772
The Dark Lord.
Don't look into her eyes.

83
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,583
Vice Principal!
What can we do for you?

84
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,555
I'm afraid I have to interrupt you
for a moment, Mr. Moore.

85
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,586
Okay, guys, calm down.
I'll be right back.

86
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,156
- What is that?
- I can't believe it.

87
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,322
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

88
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,257
- I've never seen anything like it before.
- What's going on?

89
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,563
I don't know.

90
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,669
You excused all the teachers?

91
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,435
The administration makes us teach
with a foot of snow on the ground.

92
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,067
What is this?

93
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,344
- They stopped class.
- Elliot!

94
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,580
All right.

95
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,246
There appears to be an event happening.

96
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:53,118
Central Park was just hit by
what seems to be a terrorist attack.

97
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,556
Oh, no.

98
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,657
They're not clear on the scale yet.

99
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,993
It's some kind of
airborne chemical toxin

100
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,262
that's been released
in and around the park.

101
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,100
They said to watch
for warning signs.

102
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,141
The first stage
is confused speech.

103
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,837
The second stage is physical
disorientation, loss of direction.

104
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,744
The third stage is fatal.

105
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,115
Central Park? That's kind of odd.

106
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:24,350
I spoke with the head of schools.
He said we should dismiss the students.

107
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,325
So take your planners home
so we can get back when this is over.

108
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,089
All right? Let's do our jobs.

109
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,957
Hey, you guys still got to work on
your science projects for next week.

110
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,333
What are the rules of
scientific investigation?

111
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,838
Identify variables.
Design the experiment.

112
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,708
Careful observation and measurement.
Interpretation of experimental data.

113
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,512
Hey, guys?

114
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,316
Nothing.

115
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,216
Alacrity. With alacrity, please.

116
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:07,059
My mother just called my cell again.
She's hysterical. Hysterical.

117
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,830
I told her the probability of something
happening in Philadelphia is very low.

118
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,464
I mean, nobody's telling us
to leave the city, right?

119
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,998
So I threw some figures at her.
It's good to be a math teacher sometimes.

120
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,376
You know, people are comforted
by percentages. Didn't work.

121
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,710
She still wants us to get out of
the city and come out to her house.

122
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,376
But she said for
you and Alma to come.

123
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,180
Yeah, let me think
about that, okay?

124
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,886
Did you hear about New York?

125
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,582
Are you okay?

126
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,853
No, I mean, are you okay?

127
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,487
Yeah, me, too.
Listen, I want to talk about it more.

128
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,724
Julian's mom offered for all of us to
get out of the city and stay with her.

129
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,857
What do you think?

130
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,826
Yo, Chris!

131
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,671
I'll bring Jess and Evette
and I'll meet you at the station.

132
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,234
Listen, Julian, if Alma's acting
weird, just be cool, okay?

133
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,437
What's going on?

134
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,506
She's acting odd.
Just don't worry about it, okay?

135
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,915
Odd?

136
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,921
Look, if she's acting like 
she's distant or something...

137
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,683
What?

138
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,790
I can't say any more.

139
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,522
Is she leaving you?

140
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:13,554
I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay?
Just relax, please?

141
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,692
Hey.

142
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,566
I'm going to tell you something you
should never tell your best friend.

143
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,938
Why is everybody saying that?

144
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,236
I saw her on your wedding day.

145
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,610
Again with the wedding. What?

146
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,612
I walked into a waiting room by mistake,
and she was crying.

147
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,482
She looked up. I saw her face.

148
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,787
She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot.
That's not who she is.

149
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,327
She's never going to jump in
when you need her, man.

150
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,561
<i>So do federal, state and local</i>
<i>officials have a plan in place</i>

151
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,656
<i>for this type of catastrophe?</i>

152
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,225
<i>Are they utilizing all the</i>
<i>manpower or the money...</i>

153
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,189
- Hi.
- Are you packed?

154
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,995
- Yes.
- What are they saying?

155
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,593
They're evacuating New York City.

156
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:30,141
<i>Well, our brains come equipped</i>
<i>with a self-preservation mechanism</i>

157
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,336
<i>to stop us from harmful actions.</i>

158
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,642
<i>This is controlled by a combination</i>
<i>of electrochemical signals in the brain.</i>

159
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:40,344
<i>The blocking of neurotransmitters</i>
<i>by certain toxins</i>

160
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,946
<i>has been proven to cause hallucinations,</i>
<i>asphyxiation and paralysis.</i>

161
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:49,290
<i>This new neurotoxin is basically</i>
<i>flipping the preservation switch,</i>

162
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,353
<i>blocking neurotransmitters</i>
<i>in a specific order,</i>

163
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:56,457
<i>causing specific self-damaging</i>
<i>and catastrophic effects.</i>

164
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,901
<i>Just how the toxin works</i>
<i>and who the terrorists are...</i>

165
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,063
It makes you kill yourself.

166
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,974
Just when you thought there couldn't be
any more evil that could be invented.

167
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,377
I'll be packed in two minutes.

168
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,747
<i>Hello?</i>

169
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,592
- No need to rush.
- Sir. Thank you.

170
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,290
Sir, we need to check your suitcase.

171
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,867
Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!

172
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,604
<i>This just in to the</i> Eyewitness News 
<i>room and this is the latest development.</i>

173
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:15,544
<i>Autopsies on the first victims confirm</i>
<i>the toxin is a natural compound.</i>

174
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,810
<i>The attacks remain confined</i>
<i>to the New York metropolitan area.</i>

175
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,443
<i>This is a very,
very disturbing story...</i>

176
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,919
<i>Track three now
boarding for Harrisburg.</i>

177
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,150
Hey, Jess. Where's Evette?

178
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,091
She was at a shop across town,
she got stuck in traffic.

179
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,924
- She's gonna take the next train.
- We'll wait.

180
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,827
No, no, no. She wanted us
to get on this train with Jess.

181
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,990
She'll feel a lot safer.

182
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,158
- Where's Alma?
- Restroom.

183
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,764
Hey, Julian!

184
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,636
Please have your tickets out and ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,140
I bought them.

186
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,234
It was like getting one
of those Cabbage Patch Dolls

187
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,973
when they first came out.

188
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,809
Madhouse. How are you?

189
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,145
- Good. You?
- Good.

190
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,988
- Okay, good. Why don't we all...
- I'm really glad you chose to come.

191
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:04,124
Thanks. Elliot, can I
talk to you for a second?

192
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,322
Yeah.

193
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,359
Please show me your tickets,
ladies and gentlemen.

194
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,700
- You told him about our fight?
- No.

195
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,001
- Why did he say that?
- He guessed.

196
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,635
I love you, Elliot, but I don't like to put
my feelings out there for everyone to see.

197
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,805
I'm not that type of person.

198
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,348
Elliot, these are our problems.

199
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,486
I am upset.
I'm going to sit alone and cool off.

200
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,954
By the time we get there I'll be fine.
Is that okay?

201
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,217
Fine.

202
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,396
I'm going to get on the train.

203
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,024
We're not gonna
get to sit together anyways.

204
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,363
Okay.

205
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,373
Hey, babe.

206
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,569
- Hi, Aunt Alma.
- How you doing?

207
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,044
- Hanging in there.
- Me, too.

208
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,314
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

209
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,912
You're wrong about her.
She just needs time to figure it out.

210
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,422
Come on, don't get all sensitive.

211
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,357
- Just give her a chance.
- Okay, fine. If you don't want my help...

212
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,657
- I don't want your help!
- Okay. I heard it.

213
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,994
Jess, could you ask your dad
for my ticket, please?

214
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,092
Thank you.
I'll see you on the train, Jess.

215
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,195
<i>Track 3 now boarding</i>
<i>all ticketed passengers.</i>

216
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,706
Here we go.

217
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,873
When will Mom meet us at Grandma's?

218
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,971
Mommy's gonna get on the next train.
You know how she's always late.

219
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,104
- Come on. Come on. I know. I know.
- Mom.

220
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,917
- Chilly, isn't it today, Sal?
- Maybe a little.

221
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,957
Hey, it's me. I'm on a train.
I just want to say something, okay?

222
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,588
You've got to stop calling me.

223
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,690
You're acting like the
<i>Fatal Attraction</i> guy, here.

224
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,961
I feel like I'm
going to take a shower

225
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,164
and see your silhouette
on the shower curtain.

226
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,503
We ate tiramisu together,
that is it.

227
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,603
I told you that would be it.
You have got to chill out.

228
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,444
What?

229
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,645
When?

230
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,382
In Philadelphia?

231
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,990
- I don't know. What did you hear?
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

232
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,521
What's the news?

233
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,564
Apparently Philadelphia
was just attacked.

234
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,961
- Oh, my God. Evette.
- Call Mommy. Call Mommy!

235
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,335
Honey!

236
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,710
Honey...
Yeah, yeah, where are you?

237
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,647
What? What?
I can't hear you.

238
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,910
I said I can't hear you!
Text me.

239
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,087
Text me. I can't hear you!

240
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,689
They think it started
in Rittenhouse Square Park.

241
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,422
Another park?

242
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,764
- She got on a bus going to New Jersey.
- I want to talk to her.

243
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,533
I know, baby. I know. She got out.
She's headed to the town of Princeton.

244
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,542
I want to talk to her.

245
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,283
- Do you have a phone?
- No, I'm sorry.

246
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,451
- You okay?
- They say Boston got hit, too.

247
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,359
- Where'd you hear that?
- A friend from work. What about Evette?

248
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,398
Oh, God. She made it out on a bus.

249
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,094
What the hell is going on, Elliot?

250
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,371
I honestly don't know.

251
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,162
Now what?

252
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,095
It just stopped. I don't know.

253
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,098
- Can't go nowhere.
- They're not telling us anything.

254
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,571
- Well, until we hear from...
- Sir?

255
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,164
Train service has
been discontinued.

256
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,574
This will be the last stop
for all passengers.

257
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,512
Hey! What do you mean?
Where are we?

258
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,481
Filbert, Pennsylvania.

259
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,815
Filbert?
Does anybody know where that is?

260
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,685
Why are you giving me one useless
piece of information at a time?

261
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,452
What's going on?

262
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,791
Hey, why would you just stop?
You can't just leave us here.

263
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:14,263
Sir, we lost contact.

264
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,800
With whom?

265
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,803
Everyone.

266
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,837
I'm scared. I don't like it here.
I want Mom.

267
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,776
Don't be silly.
We're safe here, okay?

268
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:35,046
Sorry. She whispers to us
when she gets scared.

269
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:41,050
We're so much the same, Jess.
I don't like to show my emotions, either.

270
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,688
She's shivering.

271
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,355
I know. I know.
She's never right without her mom.

272
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,557
It's okay.

273
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,224
They're not saying anything.

274
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,063
We're stuck here.

275
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,667
Is Jess okay?

276
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,537
She's not talking.

277
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:01,403
We're in a small town, Jess.
Nothing will happen to us here.

278
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:12,915
Don't know what you want?

279
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,719
Then just have the grilled cheese
plain with milk, okay?

280
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:15,884
Come on, come over here.

281
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,154
No, you know what?
Why don't you stay here?

282
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,027
Stay here, all right?
You can see me from over there.

283
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,190
What?
All right, you want to come with me?

284
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,029
You can come with me and wait in line.
You want to do that?

285
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,899
Bro! Bro, I got it.
Go get the milk.

286
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,996
All right, yeah. Okay.

287
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,204
You know that everyone
gives off energy, right?

288
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,273
It's scientifically proven.

289
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,511
They got these cameras
that can record what color you are

290
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,451
when you're feeling different things.

291
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:48,015
People that are angry give off a
different color than people that are sad.

292
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,720
See this ring?

293
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,731
This ring can supposedly tell you
what you're feeling.

294
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,700
Let's see what
you're feeling right now.

295
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:05,238
Yellow! That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.

296
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,070
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.

297
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,579
You must be about
to laugh or something.

298
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,742
It's probably just
about to come out.

299
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,308
We'll wait.

300
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,148
We got all day.

301
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,087
Oh, my God. There it is! Cool.
That ring really works. That's amazing.

302
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,291
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

303
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,561
My sister sent it to me.

304
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,002
It was taken an hour ago
at the Philadelphia Zoo.

305
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,705
Mother of God,
what kind of terrorists are these?

306
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,115
They're not sure it's terrorists now.

307
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,024
<i>Moments ago,
in an official statement,</i>

308
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,562
<i>the government moved away</i>
<i>from its initial position</i>

309
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,689
<i>that this was a
terrorist attack.</i>

310
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,130
<i>Authorities are now feeling,</i>

311
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,726
<i>by the sheer number</i>
<i>of incidents being reported,</i>

312
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:43,865
<i>that a terrorist group being responsible</i>
<i>is becoming less and less likely.</i>

313
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,637
<i>The event appears to be</i>
<i>limited to the Northeast,</i>

314
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,839
<i>where smaller and smaller towns</i>
<i>are being attacked.</i>

315
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:50,973
Where are we?

316
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,983
<i>The infected area now</i>
<i>includes most of New England,</i>

317
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,882
<i>from Massachusetts to Maryland.</i>

318
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,248
We're dead center.

319
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,585
Everything okay?

320
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,205
If we stay here,
we are gonna die here.

321
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:23,270
Whatever this is, it looks like it's
not occurring about 90 miles from here.

322
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,581
Let's go.

323
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,115
Anyone got a car?
Can anyone give us a ride?

324
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,564
Hey!

325
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,312
Excuse me, sir?

326
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,747
Sir, could we get a ride, please?

327
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,116
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.

328
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,620
Sir, did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation!

329
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,590
- We have a little girl with us. Please.
- Drive. Just roll up the window.

330
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,492
Sir! You're not just going to...

331
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,731
Can you believe
how crappy people are?

332
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,639
There's a car.

333
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,978
Hi. I run a plant
nursery up the street.

334
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,981
We're picking up a few things from home,
then heading

335
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,918
wherever this isn't happening.

336
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,112
We have room.

337
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,950
- We have two others.
- That's okay.

338
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,757
Julian!

339
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,287
Is Julian okay?

340
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,965
We got a ride. He can fit all of us.

341
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,975
Elliot, I can't get Evette on
the phone or e-mail or nothing.

342
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,637
- How long?
- It's been about two hours.

343
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,613
She was on that
bus headed to Princeton.

344
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,018
There's a car over there headed 
to pick up friends and family,

345
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,882
they said they
could squeeze one more.

346
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,348
We got to go.

347
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:17,394
Look, think real carefully about this.

348
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,326
She was looking
for a birthday present for Jess.

349
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:23,060
Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.

350
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,329
I'm just gonna go get her
and I want to bring her back,

351
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,167
and then I'm gonna find you guys.

352
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,901
I just...
I need you to take Jess, okay?

353
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,538
She's gonna be
a lot safer with you.

354
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,744
Don't do this to me.

355
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,249
I'm doing my best
here not to fall down.

356
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,011
I'm sure the probability of
Princeton not being hit is good.

357
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,182
Yeah.

358
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,088
You want me to throw some
figures and percentages at you

359
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,319
so we both feel better?

360
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,225
- Please.
- All right.

361
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,390
62% chance.
62% chance it hasn't even been hit.

362
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,593
- Well, you go get her, Jules, okay?
- Of course, man, of course.

363
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,192
Come on.
This is all some weird event, that's all.

364
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,229
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.

365
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,700
I have to go.

366
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,939
I got her, Julian.

367
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,346
Don't take my daughter's hand
unless you mean it.

368
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,050
I'm going to go get Mommy.

369
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,889
Hold our picture.

370
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,643
Take a look around.
We'll be ready in a jiffy.

371
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,335
We're packing
hot dogs for the road.

372
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,929
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.

373
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,771
They've got a cool shape,
they've got protein.

374
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,869
You like hot dogs, right?

375
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,313
By the way,
I think I know what's causing this.

376
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,319
- You do?
- It's the plants.

377
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,618
They can release chemicals.

378
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,186
You like hot dogs, don't you?

379
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:12,898
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going,
but we will be back soon, okay?

380
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,966
Oh, plants react to human stimulus.
They've proved it in tests.

381
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,413
Did you get the mustard?

382
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,625
Don't look outside. Stop it!

383
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,063
Stop it! Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!

384
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,798
Close the vents.

385
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,271
I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay?
And you're gonna tell me the answer.

386
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,575
What?

387
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:37,381
How much would you have if I said
I would pay you a penny on the first day

388
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,117
and then two pennies on the second,
and then four pennies on the third day

389
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,215
and I just kept doubling it
and I did this for a month?

390
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,558
How much money would you have
at the end of the month?

391
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,998
- Ten dollars.
- No, higher. Higher, higher.

392
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,297
Just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.

393
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,432
Twenty dollars?

394
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,770
No, keep going. Keep going.

395
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,251
Thirty. It's thirty. It's $30.

396
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,658
I'm gonna tell you the answer.

397
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,327
It's over $10 million.

398
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,872
You'd have over $10 million
at the end of the month.

399
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,469
You want to hear another one?

400
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,535
<i>Water contamination has surfaced</i>
<i>as one of the many theories</i>

401
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,513
<i>being taken seriously as to the cause</i>
<i>of the events in the Northeast.</i>

402
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,709
We have to go through
this little community of homes.

403
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,911
Small town called Holcomb,
then we hit the highway.

404
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,285
From there,
we're 30 miles from the state line.

405
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,850
Are those dead animals up ahead?

406
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,122
Stop the car.

407
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,268
- You don't think it's...
- I don't know.

408
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:15,107
You got binoculars in the back, from
when you were spying on our neighbors.

409
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,891
Can I have the map?

410
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,756
Elliot...

411
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,658
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.

412
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,060
It's bodies, isn't it?
I knew it would be bodies.

413
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,292
How could it not be bodies?

414
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,594
Please, give me the map.

415
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,581
Well, we have to turn around.

416
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,583
There's a right turn
about a quarter of a mile back.

417
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,178
We're just gonna take a different route,
honey, okay?

418
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,840
Oh, it's the Army. We're safe!

419
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,881
My name is Private Auster.

420
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:33,650
I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base,
about 10 miles back.

421
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,715
I think they've been affected
by whatever's happening.

422
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,623
I lost communication with them.

423
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,821
When I approached the base,

424
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:44,528
I saw military personnel
in the barbed wire, in the fence.

425
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,034
So I suggest no one take that road.

426
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,798
There's a town
about eight miles behind us.

427
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,739
There were bodies on the road into town.

428
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,801
Cheese and crackers.

429
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,705
Well, that still
leaves us two directions.

430
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,147
Just stop! Stop the vehicle!

431
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,987
- What's going on?
- Is everyone all right?

432
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,856
We have no communication with anybody.

433
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,928
- I'll talk to them.
- Did you see anything out of the ordinary?

434
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,064
Hello! Please stop!

435
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,768
Excuse me.

436
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,775
Who's Joey?

437
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,708
Oh, it's no one.

438
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,745
Any luck?

439
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,444
I can't get Julian
on his cell phone.

440
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,717
I'm sure he'll be all right.
They'll be okay.

441
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,785
Has anyone seen any other people
on the roads?

442
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,291
Maybe he's on to something.

443
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,259
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

444
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,462
Why did it start in parks?

445
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,804
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back.

446
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,603
They say there's a bus in a lake.

447
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,440
Five miles back.
There were dozens of bodies.

448
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,591
Okay.

449
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:20,161
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.

450
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,635
There's a woman
talking to her daughter.

451
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,232
She's talking to her 
daughter in Princeton.

452
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,506
Isn't that where your friend went?

453
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,080
Come on.

454
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,978
It's okay.
Honey, it's okay.

455
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,018
She's so scared.

456
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:53,324
You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.

457
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,661
Just keep watching out the window
with the tree, baby.

458
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,324
Someone will come and get you soon.

459
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,700
Tell her not to go near the window
with the tree. Just tell her.

460
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,705
Baby, don't go near the window
with the tree.

461
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,434
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.

462
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,842
Honey, someone wants to know
if Princeton's had any problems.

463
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,277
She says everyone's dead outside.

464
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,810
You just stay in your room.

465
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,116
Honey?

466
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,793
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?

467
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,523
- What do you mean? Everyone's dead?
- What?

468
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,157
Stacy... Stacy, you're scaring me.

469
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,226
I don't understand what you're saying.

470
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,532
What, baby?

471
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,631
She's just not making any sense.

472
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,199
<i>Calculus.</i>

473
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,212
<i>I see in calculus.</i>

474
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,671
<i>Calculus.</i>

475
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,843
- Stacy!
<i>- Calculus.</i>

476
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,476
Stacy!

477
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,183
Stacy Ann!

478
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,918
Oh, my God.

479
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:01,226
- I hear wind from outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

480
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,165
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.

481
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,428
Oh, no!

482
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,517
We're going to go back to the car,
okay, Jess?

483
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,093
If we went down that road,
where would that take us?

484
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,050
I walked down a quarter mile,
it was clean.

485
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:38,083
I can't tell you what's after that,
but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing.

486
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,790
- Quarter mile?
- That's not enough.

487
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,799
Hey, it's better than going back
the other way.

488
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:48,671
Get a battle plan.
Everybody makes a clean break.

489
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,104
Elliot's resilient, isn't he?

490
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,806
Yeah. He never gives up.

491
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,273
You know, plants have the ability
to target specific threats.

492
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,014
Tobacco plants,
when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars

493
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:09,081
will send out a chemical attracting
wasps to kill just those caterpillars.

494
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,820
We don't know how plants
attain these abilities.

495
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,193
They just evolve very rapidly.

496
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:18,496
Which species do you think is
doing it if you think it's true?

497
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,867
Plants have the ability to communicate
with other species of plants.

498
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,837
Trees can communicate with bushes,

499
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,001
bushes with grass
and everything in between.

500
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,710
The radio says these attacks
started happening in the cities

501
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,376
then went to the towns
and now the roads.

502
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,044
That's right.

503
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,954
Whatever's happening is happening
to smaller and smaller populations.

504
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,118
So we shouldn't be on the roads, then.

505
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,220
The terrorists, or whatever
could be watching the roads.

506
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,664
I don't have any reason
to disagree right now.

507
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,965
We are in the area of attack.

508
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,569
If you can't find a way
through the area of attack

509
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,639
we are told to find a safe zone
within the area being attacked.

510
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,311
They're attacking populations.

511
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,082
We need to go where there
aren't that many people.

512
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,316
Where people don't travel.

513
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:18,987
Now this is Mr. Collins.
He's a realtor that works in this area.

514
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,758
If we go west,
we'll hit a county called Arundell.

515
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,391
It's not on that map.

516
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:30,337
It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads.
Hardly anybody lives out there.

517
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,372
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.

518
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:40,110
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?

519
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,547
We should go into two groups.

520
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,283
Those that are
ready to go right now

521
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,790
and those that need
to get things from their cars.

522
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,384
We need to stay in groups.
Stay together.

523
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,890
We'll go soon, honey.
We'll go soon.

524
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,537
Maybe we should've waited
for the rest of them,

525
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,770
stayed in a big group,
like the Private said.

526
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,409
Your phone's out, too?

527
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,306
What's wrong?

528
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,117
Okay. I was going to tell you, okay?

529
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,554
There was this guy, Joey.

530
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:21,989
His name is Joey.
He's at work.

531
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,719
We went out and we had dessert.

532
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,592
I went out and I had dessert with him
when I told you I worked late.

533
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,926
And I didn't work late.

534
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,829
I'm feeling really guilty
in case we're gonna die.

535
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,299
I just wanted you to know that.

536
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,763
You lied to me?

537
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,347
- How much farther is it?
- I don't know.

538
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,992
- We need to keep going forward.
- Who the hell made you boss?

539
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,934
Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die.
You follow me, you're gonna live.

540
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:11,100
I'm in charge of this group!
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group!

541
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:15,669
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!

542
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,341
Private Auster?

543
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,950
My firearm is my friend.

544
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,988
Jesus.

545
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,888
Oh, no.

546
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,522
What, "Oh, no"?

547
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:14,994
The toxin?

548
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,441
The toxin is affecting them?

549
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,569
Are those people killing themselves?

550
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,408
You were with the Private.
What do we do?

551
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,609
- We need to do something!
- Just let me think.

552
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,415
- They're dying!
- I need a second.

553
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,082
They released it?
We're not near the roads.

554
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,591
We can't just stand here
as uninvolved observers!

555
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,058
I need a second, okay.
Just give me a second!

556
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,392
We are not going to be
one of those assholes on the news

557
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,364
who watches a crime happen
and not do something!

558
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,297
- We're not assholes!
- Just a second!

559
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,595
There were children in that group!

560
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,432
- Elliot, please tell us what to do.
- I need a second, okay!

561
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,770
Why can't anybody
give me a goddamn second?

562
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,433
All right, be scientific, douchebag.

563
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,479
Identify the variables.
That's the two groups.

564
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,606
Design an experiment.
That's what we're in.

565
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,651
Careful observation and measurements.
That's what I'm trying to do.

566
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,745
Interpret the experimental data.
Interpret.

567
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,318
What if it is the plants?

568
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,929
Their group was larger than ours.

569
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,988
This thing has been escalating all day.

570
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,897
Smaller and smaller populations
have been setting this off.

571
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,301
They react to human stimulus.

572
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,573
Maybe people are
setting off the plants?

573
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,132
What are you saying? That guy was crazy.
We have to save them.

574
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,474
They're already dead.

575
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,105
What if they're
targeting us as threats?

576
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,312
This part of the field
may not have been set off.

577
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,184
Something in this field could be
releasing the chemical into the air

578
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,190
when there's too
many of us together.

579
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,452
Let's just stay
ahead of the wind.

580
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,348
Let's just break up into groups.

581
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,489
Come on! Come on! This way!
Come on, follow me!

582
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:25,359
I'm right here! Keep going!
I'm right behind you!

583
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,638
Here it comes!

584
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,713
Don't you let go of my hand.

585
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,927
Nothing happened.

586
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,870
It's the size of the groups,
I think.

587
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,075
Could this really be happening?

588
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,311
What are your names?

589
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,974
- Jared.
- Josh.

590
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,551
Wait, wait!

591
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:07,592
I'm going to go see if that truck
has a map. You guys wait here.

592
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,854
<i>Why aren't they looking</i>
<i>into nuclear power plants?</i>

593
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,332
<i>There are 15 or more</i>
<i>in the Northeast alone.</i>

594
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,801
<i>More than anywhere else</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

595
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,431
<i>There's probably been</i>
<i>some leak or something.</i>

596
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,941
<i>It's probably poisoning the air.</i>

597
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,447
There's a house over there! Come on!

598
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,480
It could have been
some terrorist booby-trap,

599
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,355
someone stepped on
it out in the field.

600
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,485
Yeah, in a field
in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania.

601
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,189
I don't know.

602
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,367
Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent in a certain density.

603
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:16,030
The source had to be close to that field,
if not in the field.

604
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,663
Here's one.

605
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:24,041
Plants have the chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.

606
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,306
You think it could be plants?

607
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,975
I don't know.

608
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,149
But if it is, and people are
setting it off in groups,

609
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,384
we need to go to the least
populated place we can to be safe.

610
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,824
We can't walk to the borders where this
isn't happening, Alma. It's too far.

611
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:42,228
Whatever it is, terrorists,
a nuclear leak, plants,

612
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,733
it's probably safe to get
away from people right now.

613
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,566
That must be Arundell.
It's 10 miles from here.

614
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,903
Okay, this place must have a bathroom.
I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave.

615
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,373
Hurry.

616
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,222
Hello?

617
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,185
My name is Elliot Moore.

618
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,732
I'm just going to talk
in a very positive manner.

619
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,599
Giving off good vibes.

620
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:25,539
We're just here to use the bathroom
and then we're just gonna leave.

621
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,543
I hope that's okay.

622
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,550
Plastic.

623
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,912
I'm talking to a plastic plant.

624
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,256
I'm still doing it.

625
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,898
You guys ready to leave?

626
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:53,959
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving the front door unlocked?

627
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,061
Hey, everything's fake.

628
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,322
Why is this happening?

629
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,487
I don't know for sure, Josh.

630
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,430
But I read this article
about the coast of Australia.

631
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,163
It said they found large quantities
of a primordial bacteria.

632
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,603
It hadn't been around for billions
of years, it just appeared in the water.

633
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:34,440
It's toxic to humans, fishermen
who come in contact with it are dying.

634
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,808
It feels kind of similar to that.

635
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,145
With the bees disappearing, I mean,
I don't know, it feels like a pattern.

636
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,612
The nature of events
like the one in Australia

637
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,348
is that they crest and then stop.

638
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:48,618
We just have to be
alive when it's over.

639
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:51,456
I don't believe it's nature.

640
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,828
It may not be. There could be some
other explanation. I don't know.

641
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,201
Let's go.

642
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,359
There are people coming!

643
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,407
We can't stay here. It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.

644
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,819
There's two groups coming together.

645
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,588
There's too many of them together.

646
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,359
Run. Run.

647
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,139
- Is she your kid?
- No.

648
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,374
- You got kids?
- No.

649
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,144
How come? You got a problem?

650
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:24,118
No. She wanted to wait.

651
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,881
Really? For what?

652
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:29,083
Me to grow up.
Why are we talking about this?

653
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:34,621
Sweet. I used to love those.
Can I see it?

654
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:40,301
You need to take personal responsibility
for yourself in a relationship.

655
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,963
- That'll make a difference.
- Okay. Thank you.

656
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,167
Hey, that's not a toy.
It's got meaning to me.

657
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,803
- Elliot! Look!
- Come on.

658
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,075
Oh, wow.

659
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,119
<i>... is an emergency broadcast.</i>

660
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,788
<i>All those who are still inside</i>
<i>the affected area of the Northeast</i>

661
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:10,924
<i>are asked to proceed to the police</i>
<i>borders west of your state.</i>

662
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:12,659
Come on.

663
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,101
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

664
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,972
<i>... inside the affected area...</i>

665
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,008
Jess needs a 10-minute rest
and some food.

666
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,791
Are you sure?
We should keep going.

667
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,695
I know, but she's only eight.

668
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,994
What?

669
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,697
If we're going to die,
I want you to know something.

670
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,864
I was in the pharmacy a while ago,

671
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,966
and there was a really good-looking
pharmacist behind the counter.

672
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,635
Really good-looking.

673
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:58,203
And I went up and I asked her
where the cough syrup was.

674
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,544
I didn't even have a cough.

675
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,811
And I almost bought it.

676
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:06,481
And I'm talking about a completely
superfluous bottle of cough syrup.

677
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,820
That's like six bucks.

678
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,021
Are you joking?

679
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,659
Thank you.

680
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:55,693
- Maybe that's not a good idea.
- I told her just for a minute.

681
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,241
Mr. Moore,
I think I can open this door.

682
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,975
Wait. We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?

683
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,913
- Come on, guys.
- Listen, nobody's home.

684
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,611
We're just gonna
get some food for Jess.

685
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:12,153
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's
lived here for a long time anyway.

686
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,120
I mean, it's all boarded up.

687
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,658
Maybe we could leave some money.

688
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:24,089
- What kind of tree is this?
- I think it's a maple.

689
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,966
Not so high.

690
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,561
Okay, Josh, open the door.

691
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,673
Wait!

692
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,941
I see something.

693
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,842
- There's somebody in there!
- You sure?

694
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,811
Yeah, I saw him move.

695
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,773
I see him!

696
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:44,920
Let's stop.

697
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:51,658
Is there any way we could get some food?
We have a little girl.

698
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,252
- We just want to get her some food.
- You best leave now.

699
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,298
You ain't gonna bring that
poison gas in here with you.

700
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,164
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.

701
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,500
- They said to stay inside.
- We're fine right now.

702
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,596
Nothing's happened out here yet.

703
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,871
I mean, you can see that.
Just listen to our voices.

704
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,968
We're perfectly normal.

705
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,478
<i>Old black water,
keep on rolling</i>

706
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,042
<i>Mississippi moon</i>
<i>Won't you keep on shining on me?</i>

707
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,187
See? We're normal.

708
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,390
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.

709
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:27,554
Okay. It's not worth it.

710
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,829
Open the door, bitch!

711
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,494
Hey, Josh, don't do that.
He didn't mean that!

712
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,666
- There's more than one in there.
- Jess! Jess, come here.

713
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,506
Stop it, Jess. Listen, we just want some
food for a little girl, you pussies!

714
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,012
- Jess, come here.
- Josh, stop it.

715
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,172
You'd best not let that gas in here.

716
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,481
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.

717
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:55,252
- You might be with the terrorists!
- I don't think it's terrorists, sir.

718
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,327
- Josh, stop it!
- They're being crazy, Mr. Moore!

719
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,521
- Show your faces!
- Let the gas in...

720
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,064
No!

721
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,405
Jared!

722
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,930
We're gonna get
out of this nightmare.

723
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,408
Elliot!

724
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,414
We have to go.
We have to protect Jess.

725
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,245
Okay?

726
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:04,826
You've got to three
to get off our porch!

727
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,991
Come here.

728
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:20,140
<i>No new people have crossed</i>
<i>over the border for a few hours.</i>

729
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:24,111
<i>It appears those residents that are still</i>
<i>in the affected area of the Northeast</i>

730
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,477
<i>are trying to wait it out.</i>

731
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,879
<i>We have Professor Kendel Wallace</i>
<i>of Carnegie Mellon,</i>

732
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,078
<i>a statistician, here with us.</i>
<i>Professor, what can you tell us?</i>

733
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,688
<i>Calculating by the rise in</i>
<i>intensity of reports of incidents</i>

734
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:39,490
<i>within the affected area,</i>
<i>one can guess at a crude timetable.</i>

735
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:43,031
<i>One can see the incident</i>
<i>is rising in sensitivity.</i>

736
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:46,927
<i>We've seen fewer and fewer people</i>
<i>can provoke the attacks.</i>

737
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:51,599
<i>The event should be at its most</i>
<i>sensitive tomorrow morning.</i>

738
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:55,508
<i>Typically, these type of slopes</i>
<i>drop precipitously after cresting,</i>

739
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,843
<i>meaning it could end suddenly,</i>
<i>at any moment.</i>

740
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:02,679
<i>Of course,
these are only probabilities.</i>

741
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,047
<i>There are some quiet rumblings</i>

742
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:06,815
<i>that the government may be</i>
<i>involved in the tragic events</i>

743
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:10,256
<i>playing out in the Northeast.</i>
<i>Now, these rumors have been fuelled</i>

744
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,159
<i>by the statements</i>
<i>of a confidential informant</i>

745
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:17,165
<i>who claims that the CIA</i>
<i>has facilities in the Northeast,</i>

746
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:21,329
<i>where they are testing drugs with</i>
<i>some similar psychotropic properties</i>

747
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,134
<i>as a defense against
chemical weapons.</i>

748
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,004
<i>CIA and White House officials</i>

749
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,067
<i>have declined to respond</i>
<i>to these accusations.</i>

750
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:32,477
<i>Perimeters have been set up</i>
<i>all along the East Coast</i>

751
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,517
<i>from Maryland</i>
<i>all the way to Massachusetts.</i>

752
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:50,159
This house has no power going to it.

753
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,396
Nobody's driven on this driveway
for a long time, either.

754
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,097
Let me go. You guys stay right here.

755
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,400
That's for Clement.

756
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,303
He's a retriever.

757
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,037
You lost?

758
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,650
You must be.

759
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,744
There ain't nothing
around here for miles.

760
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,916
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?

761
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:59,496
I suppose the kind thing for me
to do is to offer you supper.

762
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,141
I ain't gonna ask you again.

763
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,130
I hope the meal was sufficient.

764
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:35,165
I wasn't expecting guests.

765
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,441
This is a beautiful place.

766
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,374
There's a springhouse in the back.

767
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:52,713
They used to hide people
from slave chasers back there.

768
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:59,489
It has a speaking tube running
under the ground to the main house.

769
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:05,159
You can hear each other
like you were in the same room.

770
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,198
So, what's with you two?

771
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,973
Who's chasing who?

772
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,179
I'm sorry?

773
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:24,345
Ain't no time two people staring
at each other, standing still,

774
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,753
love in both their eyes,
at the same time, equal.

775
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:32,891
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.

776
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,524
That's the way we's built.

777
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,495
So?

778
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,163
Who's chasing?

779
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,504
I knew that. I knew that.

780
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,781
Don't touch things that aren't yours.

781
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,862
- Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
- No.

782
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,899
I got enough to fill my time right here.

783
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,926
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.

784
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,540
Although I ain't got the touch.

785
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,546
Gardens don't grow the way they should.
Never have.

786
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:30,614
- How do you stay in contact with others?
- I don't.

787
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,554
How would you know if something
were to happen? Like a world event?

788
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,650
Mrs. Jones, something's happened
along the East Coast.

789
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,729
Whatever it is that 
you think is so important

790
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,230
that you need to tell me, don't.

791
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,460
Just keep it to yourself.

792
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,099
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.

793
01:06:56,979 --> 01:07:00,005
Suppose I have to
let you spend the night.

794
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,013
Guest room's up on the left.

795
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,678
Mind the steps.

796
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,679
I'm scared, Elliot.

797
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,271
It's okay.

798
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:40,285
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. I was being stupid.

799
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,154
You've been great taking care of Jess.

800
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,189
I don't like this woman.

801
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:53,132
There's something <i>Exorcist-y</i> about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?

802
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,836
Well, we need to stay in this house.

803
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,636
You want me to protect you,
this is how we have to do it.

804
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,835
Let's just deal with her.

805
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,496
I hear you whispering.

806
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,059
Planning on stealing something?

807
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,930
No, ma'am, we're not.

808
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,698
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?

809
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,535
What? No!

810
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,525
Mrs. Jones?

811
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,269
Mrs. Jones?

812
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:36,960
Crazy lady.

813
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,031
You trying to steal my things?

814
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:42,297
No! No, Mrs. Jones,
I actually wanted to talk with you.

815
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:46,865
- You all are gonna leave right now!
- Ma'am, you don't understand.

816
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,706
There's something happening
in a few states, in this region.

817
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,246
- It's not safe!
- Leave now!

818
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:11,864
The Lord is my shepherd.

819
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:17,031
The Lord is my shepherd.

820
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,873
Mrs. Jones,
could we talk calmly for a second?

821
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,276
Just hear me out.
See, I'm a teacher...

822
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,223
Mrs. Jones?

823
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,868
Oh, my God.

824
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,473
Alma, shut the windows
and the doors!

825
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,474
Alma?

826
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,781
Alma?

827
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,175
Alma?

828
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,175
Jess?

829
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:44,308
Hi, froggie! Hi, froggie!

830
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,867
Okay, yeah. Wait.

831
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,874
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby? I think he's a baby.

832
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,710
He's so tiny.
I didn't know frogs could be like that.

833
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,118
Oh, he got water on my shoe.

834
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,222
Isn't this a cool house?

835
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:28,024
If we had this house,
we could make it look so pretty.

836
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:34,801
Get him again. Get him again.
Hey, froggie.

837
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:36,370
Alma?

838
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,707
Good morning, Elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.

839
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,870
- Close the windows and the doors, Alma.
- Why?

840
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,082
Mrs. Jones just died.
Close the windows.

841
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,920
Close the door, Jess!

842
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,239
- Is everything closed?
- Yes.

843
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:35,190
- I'm sorry, Alma.
- What's going on, Elliot?

844
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:37,927
It's happening here.

845
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,026
It could be the grass and
the trees are doing this now.

846
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,037
She was alone when it happened.

847
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:47,438
Seems like they might have
gotten more sensitive.

848
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:51,813
It's too dangerous
to go outside, isn't it?

849
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,347
Yes.

850
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,345
This is the end, isn't it?

851
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,487
I wish you were here.

852
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:04,982
Me, too.

853
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,706
You remember our first date?

854
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,545
You were so quiet.

855
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,978
You bought me the mood ring.

856
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:32,411
It turned purple when you wore it.

857
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:37,021
Then you said,
"That means you're in love."

858
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:41,928
It got you to talk, didn't it?

859
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,165
Then we checked
the little paper chart,

860
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,506
and it turned out that 
purple meant I was horny.

861
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:00,072
- You loved that.
- I had no idea.

862
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:05,987
Yours was blue.
Peaceful, right?

863
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,579
Right.

864
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,123
What color was love?

865
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:19,229
I don't remember.

866
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,768
Me, neither.

867
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,108
Elliot?

868
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,305
Yeah?

869
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:35,179
I was just making
sure you're there.

870
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,858
It's not right for it to end like this.

871
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,361
If we're gonna die,
I want to be with you.

872
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:52,331
I want to be with you,
and I'm gonna come and be with you.

873
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:58,032
Elliot, don't!

874
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:29,155
<i>The event must have ended</i>
<i>before we went out there.</i>

875
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,467
I found the hair clip!

876
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,632
You don't want to be late
for the first day schools are open.

877
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:50,967
Oh, wait.

878
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:56,209
I'm just gonna put this right here.

879
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,052
Okay?

880
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,651
- Are you okay?
- Yes, Aunt Alma. I love you.

881
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,227
I love you, too. Come here.

882
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:26,306
All right. I'll pick you up
after you're done with school, okay?

883
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:38,992
Bye.

884
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,499
<i>As everyone knows by now,</i>

885
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,935
<i>traces of the neurotoxin have been</i>
<i>found in some plants and trees.</i>

886
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,403
<i>Now, most environmentalists feel</i>

887
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:55,408
<i>that this event is like</i>
<i>the red tide in the ocean,</i>

888
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,913
<i>but instead of algae killing fish,</i>
<i>this happened on land.</i>

889
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,573
<i>Now, plants and trees</i>
<i>just can't pick up and move</i>

890
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:03,378
<i>when they feel threatened,</i>
<i>like other species.</i>

891
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:07,615
<i>They have only one option,</i>
<i>to rapidly evolve their chemistry.</i>

892
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:09,212
<i>Well.</i>

893
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:14,194
<i>Kay from Mississippi wants to know</i>
<i>why it started so suddenly,</i>

894
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:19,529
<i>on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended</i>
<i>so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning.</i>

895
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:24,800
<i>Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest,</i>
<i>this was an act of nature,</i>

896
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,374
<i>and we'll never fully understand it.</i>

897
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:31,071
<i>And, Doctor, there's been</i>
<i>a lot of speculation</i>

898
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,309
<i>as to why this happened</i>
<i>in the Northeast only.</i>

899
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,076
<i>How do you explain that?</i>

900
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,711
<i>Well, I believe, all right,</i>
<i>and this is just my opinion,</i>

901
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,550
<i>that this was a prelude, okay?</i>

902
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:43,921
<i>A warning,
like the first spot of a rash.</i>

903
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:46,153
<i>We have become
a threat to this planet.</i>

904
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,252
<i>I don't think anybody
will argue that.</i>

905
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,298
<i>- And this is a warning.</i>
<i>- A warning?</i>

906
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:54,095
<i>I think the skeptics would believe that</i>
<i>if it had occurred anywhere else.</i>

907
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,763
<i>That's why most people</i>
<i>believe it was the government.</i>

908
01:22:56,838 --> 01:23:00,899
<i>If it had happened in one other place,</i>
<i>anywhere else,</i>

909
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,273
<i>we could all believe
what you're saying.</i>

910
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:42,704
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

911
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:45,036
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?

912
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:50,213
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

913
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,950
That frightened me.

914
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,728
I should drop my bicycle off

915
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:05,957
What?

916
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:18,041
My God...

917
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:21,007
My
bicycle.

918
01:28:20,779 --> 01:28:21,780
