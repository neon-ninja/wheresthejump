Maybe.

37
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,166
I'm sure he doesn't
approve of all the time

38
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,466
you spend with Mary.

00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,666
Oh!

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,536
Now we're going there?

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,876
I thought we talked about this.

42
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,776

Yo, Jay!

47
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,066
Jason, yo.

48
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,206
You got my text, right?

49
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,036
You got-it was a dick.

50
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,806
Yeah.

51
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,236
You got that, right?

52
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,876
Yeah, I got it.

53
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Ok. Get in.

54
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,046
Ow!

55
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,546
What's up, big Jay?

56
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,310
Hey, Mr. Slade.

57
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,716
Hi, Miss Lisa.

58
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,146
Hey.

59
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,946
Hey Summer.

60
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,246
You know, why do you
always wait outside

61
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,116
when we come and pick you up?

62
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,186
You never let me in your house.

63
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,956
Are you-are you embarrassed
of me or something?

64
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,056
Like, what if I
have to pee, man?

65
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,256
No, man.

66
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,256
I just-you know, my house is
a trashy piece of ding dong.

67
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,926
No, my house is a way
trashier piece of ding dong.

68
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,866
There's no way, man.

69
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,900
Yeah, no, 'cause we're
way poorer than you-

70
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,606
Hey, Colin, come on.

71
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,866
We're not that poor.

72
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,666
And stop saying "ding dong".

73
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,736
You sound super lame.

74
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,976
Hey, there we go.

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ha ha!

76
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,580
Jesus Christ, Roger!

77
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,686
Don't text and drive, dad!

78
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,246
I got it!

79
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,186
I'm not texting, ok?

80
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,950
I'm checking my emails.

81
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,956
Alright, guys.

82
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,686
Let's go eat.

83
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,056
Summer, wake up your brother.

84
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,086
Ok.

85
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,226
Oh, no.

86
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,156
Oh, come on, honey.

87
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,866
The Hilltop Diner I'm
sure is good enough

88
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,066
for your distinguished palate.

89
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,236
Yeah, Lisa, I hear that they
serve their chicken nuggets

90
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,100
with caviar.

91
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,806
Mmm, nuggets.

92
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,170
Eh, I'm not hungry.

93
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,706
Sure you don't want somethin'?

94
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,140
Yeah, a top off.

95
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,976
Nobody likes a
morning drunk, Lisa.

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,176
Nobody likes a
smart-ass, Summer.

97
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,276
I like morning drunk Lisa.

98
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,186
I'm on vaycay mode.

99
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,756
Great catch, dad.

100
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,186
I hate you.

101
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,986
Be quick.

102
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,856
Yeah.

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
I'm gonna post that.

104
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,296
What'd you say?

105
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,996
I said "great catch".

106
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,250
And "I hate you".

107
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,330
Oh, wow.

108
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,076
Check out all the missing bros.

109
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,216
I mean, ugh.

110
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,216
One dude called himself "Gator".

111
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,186
What a dick.

112
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,950
Come on, Colin.

113
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,746
Don't be an asshole.

114
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,716
Those guys are missing.

115
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,016
Dad, did you crack a
window open for Lisa?

116
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,926
Don't disrespect your maybe
future stepmom, please.

117
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,726
Ugh.

118
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,096
Oh, seriously dad, don't settle.

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
What? She's nice.

120
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,196
Yeah, but so was
Dolores and Denise...

121
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,466
And Shannon and Lily.

122
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,766
Yes, and Michelle, too.

123
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,296
Michelle.

124
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,966
Oh, yeah, Michelle.

125
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,466
She was hot.

126
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,306
She was super hot.

127
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,036
Really hot.

128
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,806
I blew that one.

129
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,436
I blew it.

130
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,006
Yeah, it sucks.

131
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,006
And what can I get ya?

132
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,806
Oh, hi.

133
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,876
Uh, yeah.

134
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,276
We will start off with uh,
maybe some bigger menus.

135
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,016
Ok.

136
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,316
Uh, can I get some coffee?

137
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,986
You know, com-don't
listen to him.

138
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,456
He's making me sound like I'm
an irresponsible parent.

139
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,726
We'll just get four
beers, please.

140
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,166
Nope, still nothing.

141
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,996
I'll get the Trucker's Breakfast
please and thank you.

142
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,096
Uh, salad, please.

143
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,966
Uh, can I get toast
and jam, please?

144
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,306
Uh, can I just get
some eggs and shit?

145
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,276
Colin, come on.

146
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,210
Can I have some eggs
and shit, please?

147
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,276
Eggs and shit coming right up.

148
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,846
Thank you.

149
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,446
Shouldn't take too long.

150
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,246
That's-you wanna take those?

151
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,886
No?

152
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,956
Ok, we'll just leave them.

153
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,790
So, guys, who's excited, huh?

154
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,386
Camping trip?

155
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,226
I'm excited.

156
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,956
Going to a cabin.

157
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,456
We're gonna act like rednecks,

158
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,766
or people who don't trust
the government, huh?

159
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,796
You already don't.

160
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,126
I know I don't, yeah.

161
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,396
So, Jay?

162
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,896
Not excited?

163
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,866
Your dad doesn't take you
camping or something?

164
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,136
No, my dad's not really the
camping type, Mr. Slade.

165
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
Yeah, 'cause your dad's more of
the dick-sucking type, right?

166
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,506
Stop!

167
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,306
Woah, Colin, too much. Uh uh.

168
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,846
No, I mean, that's
what Jason says

169
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,076
and Jay knows I'm just
messin' with him.

170
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,416
That's how we roll.

171
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,286
What, you act like a little
douche and then Jason

172
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,450
politely takes it?

173
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,986
Hey, I don't just take it.

174
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,486
You kinda do, Jay.

175
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,286
Yeah, you kinda do,
Jay, honestly.

176
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,026
You need to toughen up a
little bit, you know?

177
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,796
Start with a power
five, you know?

178
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,866
See, a power five.

179
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,530
Like this, come on. Power five!

180
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,026
Like that.

181
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,766
We'll work on it.

182
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,796
We'll work on it this weekend.

183
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,006
Or you could just be super
butchy like Summer.

184
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,236
Hey, shut up, pube-head.

185
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,206
Uh uh, stop it.

186
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,840
Stop what?

187
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,006
Stop wasting food, Colin.

188
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,146
Ketchup is not food,
Ronald Reagan.

189
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,016
Ok, stop it now-

190
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,980
Ooooh!

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Guys, come on!

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,316
Oh man!

193
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,186
Shit, Colin!

194
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,886
Colin, enough. Seriously.

195
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,986
Summer, language.

196
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,020
Jason, bathroom.

197
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,716
I'm sorry about that, Jay.

198
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,526
That was super trashy of me.

199
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,890
What?

200
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,080
It was funny.

201
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,926
Uh uh.

202
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,396
What?

203
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,096
Nope!

204
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,966
Ok, alright.

205
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,836
Put it down!

206
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,236
Ok, just leave the
condiments alone.

207
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,236
Please.

208
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,336
I swear both of you are
adopted, you know that?

209
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,876
That's some funny shit, dude.

210
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,906
Seriously, you should
come by my dad's cottage.

211
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,346
You know, I'm gonna
start my own business-

212
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,010
Blue chips, paint chips, stocks.

213
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,046
Yeah.

214
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,546
Yeah, we like to
go to the casino-

215
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,316
Paint chip stocks?

216
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,380
Yeah.

217
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,086
Seriously, you should
come to my dad's cottage,

218
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,286
it is so chill.

219
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,256
Hot tub.

220
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,256
So. Chill.

221
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,990
Um...

222
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,626
excuse me, I need to...
get through...

223
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,496
Hey! Hey, broskis!

224
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,260
Can you let the kid
through, please?

225
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,366
Dude.

226
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,400
I think that kid just
got his first period.

227
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,206
What a fine young
woman you've become.

228
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,176
Sweetie, don't let the
big bad bros scare ya.

229
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,976
They might look pretty but
they ain't that smart.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,600
I like you guys better
drunk and quiet.

231
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,286
The more you drink the less you
talk and the more I like you.

232
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,086
Hear that, bro?

233
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,380
She thinks we're pretty.

234
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,056
Why don't you go get the rest
of that taken care of, sweetie?

235
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,096
Alright, thanks.

236
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,026
I'll just...

237
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,166
Yeah, let's get lit!

238
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,436
Don't forget to thank
the nice lady, Jason.

239
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,500
Don't forget to ask your
friend for a tampon, Jason.

240
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,500
I had coffee.

241
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,550
I saved you some sausages.

242
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,326
You like sausages,
don't you, Lisa?

243
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,156
Colin.

244
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,896
Yeah.

245
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,926
Of course she likes sausages.

246
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,360
We're talking about penises.

247
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,440
Couldn't find somewhere
further, could you?

248
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,190
Seriously, Roger.

249
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,726
Yeah, seriously, dad.

250
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,596
It's the cheapest place

251
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,626
that I could find on
Craigslist, alright?

252
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,726
You think that I can
afford a place that is not

253
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,720
in the middle of nowhere
or potentially dangerous?

254
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,036
Hey, you picked him.

255
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,170
He's my dad so I
have to like him.

256
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,590
You guys are bonding.

257
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,006
That makes me feel
all warm inside.

258
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,430
Don't settle, Lisa.

259
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,656
It's nice being out of
the city, eh, Summer?

260
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,556
Touching nature.

261
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,326
Being able to be in
touch with nature.

262
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,626
Yeah, Jay.

263
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,096
You can touch nature all
you want, there, buddy.

264
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,566
No, I just meant...

265
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,796
it's nice to spend
time and uh...

266
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,366
can I grab your bag for you?

267
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,666
Knock yourself out, boy scout.

268
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,100
This place looks
like a murder cabin.

269
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,576
Jay, you should keep
my sister close

270
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,310
so she can protect you.

271
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,346
You know, it doesn't say
it in the instructions

272
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,156
but I mean there's
gotta be a hidden key

273
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,156
around here somewhere, right?

274
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,526
High-tech security.

275
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,790
Safe.

276
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,886
Shotgun the best room!

277
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,196
You can't shotgun what
you can't see, dumb-ass.

278
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,126
Nyuuuh.

279
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,996
Ok, watch the booze, Rog.

280
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,696
I am not spending a
week in here sober.

281
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,066
Women. Am I right, big guy?

282
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,790
Let me help you with that.

283
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,060
Oh.

284
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,746
This is nice.

285
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,180
Dad, this place sucks.

286
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,186
What're you talking about?

287
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,780
It's cozy in here.

288
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,516
Where's Lisa?

289
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,556
Oh, Lisa's gone.

290
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,740
What do you mean, she's gone?

291
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,496
She get a ca-oh, you're joking.

292
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,556
Ha.

293
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,126
Funny.

294
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,080
Just up there, Jason.

295
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,776
Thanks for dropping my bags off.

296
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,346
Oh, yeah, no, that was...

297
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,316
that was no problem, Summer.

298
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,140
I was just uh... just
happy I could help.

299
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,410
You know, I've seen the
way you look at me.

300
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,630
You're like 14 or something?

301
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,236
Adorable.

302
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
But weird.

303
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,776
Adorable is good, right?

304
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Nah.

305
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,616
You blew it, man.

306
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,180
Oh, I shotgun this
bed, by the way.

307
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,286
If you forgot the
white tequila, Roger,

308
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,586
I swear to God...

309
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,256
Come on, my little
fortune cookie,

310
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,856
I'd never forget the white gold.

311
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,526
Oh, dad, sweet racism.

312
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,426
What?

313
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,496
Was I racist?

314
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,876
I'm gonna explore.
You two coming?

315
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,376
Hmm, spend more time
with my lame sister?

316
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,646
Yeah, sure, we'll go.

317
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,276
Ok.

318
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,946
Dad, Lisa, we're leaving!

319
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,916
Ok, later.

320
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,380
Babe, pay attention to me!

321
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,426
Wow, you must be a really
good pitcher, Summer.

322
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,986
I play first base.

323
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,896
So, uh... your parents
like to party, huh?

324
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,230
Lisa's not my mom.
But yeah, they do.

325
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,250
Yours?

326
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,736
Um... yeah, no, they
party all the time.

327
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,906
They're, like, super trashy.

328
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,636
Ok, dude, don't try to hit
on my sister in front of me.

329
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,706
I wasn't hitting on
your sister, man.

330
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,730
She's not even really my type.

331
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,880
Really? Why is that?

332
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,256
Well, uh... you walk
weird, and um...

333
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,826
uh, your hair is too messy

334
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:43,366
and, uh, you can be mean
sometimes and, uh...

335
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,496
well, your family is-

336
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,536
Messed up?

337
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,406
That's not what I meant-

338
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,430
To say?

339
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,806
Look, I'm messing
with you, Jason.

340
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,360
You really gotta loosen up, man.

341
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,786
My family's messed
up, too, you know.

342
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,610
Strike two, playa.

343
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,690
Yooooo!

344
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,496
Check it out!

345
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,666
Woah.

346
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,536
Maybe a deer died
here or something.

347
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,766
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

348
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,520
This would be good for
LARP Camp next week.

349
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,646
Uh, yeah, about that live action
role play thing next week...

350
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:05,586
well, I mean, it's really
more of a seminar.

351
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,786
But, uh, I don't even know
if I can go or whatever.

352
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,920
Oh, 'cause you wanna go
on a date with my sister?

353
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,886
Dude.

354
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,786
No way, man.

355
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,826
I mean, she could come
to LARP camp too,

356
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,626
but I mean, she would
make a great demon cow.

357
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,926
Whatever, man.

358
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,096
Ugliest, nastiest demon cow.

359
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,736
Woah.

360
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,666
Ever.

361
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,406
Well, I mean, she's-
she's not that ugly.

362
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,476
Dude.

363
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,536
Gross.

364
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,606
Hey! Dungeons and Dildos,
let's keep moving!

365
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,806
We were just, you know-

366
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,360
Dude. Who cares?

367
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,546
Whatever you're showing

00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,390
Let's go, ok?

557
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,056
You got any 8's?

558
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,326
Go fish.

559
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,226
It's your lucky day, cowgirl.

560
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,136
You got any 4's?

561
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,636
Mmm...

562
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,536
nope.

563
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,060
Go fish.

564
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,716
Caught a big one.

565
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,686
Well, well, well.

566
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,416
Start-

567
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,216
Dad! Dad!

568
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,816
Oh, shit!

569
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
Dad, there's a psycho bitch!

570
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,326
Lisa and I, we were just um...

571
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,590
Playing Go Fish Foreplay, yeah.

572
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,656
Wait, that's a thing?

573
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,326
Fuck, hot dogs.

574
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,166
Hey, sensible bites, Colin.

575
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,830
Ok, dad, you need
to listen to me.

576
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,936
Yeah, what's up?

577
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,706
The-the neighbour, it's-
it's our neighbour and it-

578
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,736
Henry's here?

579
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,570
I love that guy.

580
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,776
Sperm whale, where
are you, you...

581
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,836
What the fuck, dad?

582
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,776
Not our neighbour back
home, our neighbour here!

583
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,210
Are you drunk already?

584
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,306
If I say yes will you be mad?

585
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:15,646
Yes!

586
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,516
Then no.

587
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,080
Ok, dad, you really
need to focus here.

588
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,116
Ok.

589
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,086
Our neighbour, she drugged
these guys and then-

590
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,116
and then I think she
killed one of them and-

591
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,740
No, she would have fed
them to something.

592
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,086
That's the same as killing them!

593
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,056
Mmm.

594
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,626
So what you're saying
is that our neighbour,

595
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,120
who is a lady, is
also a cannibal.

596
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,736
Colin, is she hot?

597
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Yeah.

598
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,666
We gotta go then and
check this out.

599
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,366
Ok, dad-

600
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,766
Lisa...

601
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,636
Look, we-can we just call the
cops and get outta here?

602
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,776
Come on, we're not
gonna call the cops.

603
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,740
Look.

604
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Fine. I'll drive.

605
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,176
Yeah, I'm gonna let you drive.

606
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,716
Screw you, Lisa.

607
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,316
Oh, Summer, come on.

608
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,816
You don't suppose that there's
a landline around here

609
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,616
or something?

610
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,516
What's a landline?

611
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,686
Oh my god, why did
we even come here?!

612
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,386
'Cause it's cheap.

613
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,226
Alright, ok, guys, seriously.

614
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:01,890
Enough.

615
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,326
We'll go for a walk.

616
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,126
I'm gonna get some fresh air,

617
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,296
and check out this cabin.

618
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,596
Together.

619
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,766
Ok?

620
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,300
If there's anything shady going
on I'll take care of it.

621
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,506
No, dad, nu-uh.

622
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,906
Summer. Summer.

623
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,336
Hey, I got this.

624
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,776
Huh?

625
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,276
Seriously dad, you're really
not helping anything.

626
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,400
Jason. Jason!

627
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,246
Have fun, Jason!

628
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,870
I'll have fun in here
not getting eaten!

629
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,810
You can help me make dinner.

630
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,510
No.

631
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,110
I guess you already ate.

632
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,826
Woah.

633
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,896
I peed on my beer cans.

634
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,866
I almost wrote my whole name.

635
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,666
Here.

636
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,436
What do you want me
to do with this?

637
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,406
Woah, woah, woah,

638
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,840
hey now, Jay, big Jay,
come on, no, no, no.

639
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,846
Only responsible- rebe...
response...

640
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,246
only persponsible grown-ups
are allowed to use the axes.

641
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,486
Mmmkay?

642
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,550
Lisa.

643
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,756
Lisa!

644
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,320
Huh?

645
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,516
Take a photo of-of me.

646
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,770
I look like a lumberjack.

647
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,190
You look so sexy.

648
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,926
Eh?

649
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,266
That's disgusting.

650
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,236
No, it's not.

651
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,866
It's sexy.

652
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,866
You heard her say it.

653
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,930
Ugh.

654
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,236
With any luck he's gonna
get bored and fall asleep

655
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,906
and then we can drag his
drunk ass back home.

656
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,690
No, you won't!

657
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,840
Hey, look! I got a kick-stand.

658
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,316
You drink six, you
piss out twelve.

659
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,816
Am I right, kids?

660
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,756
Yeah, dad, you've had your fun,
so we can go back now, right?

661
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,556
There's hot dogs at home.

662
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,726
Yeah, but this is way more fun.

663
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,666
I don't think he should be
out here in this state.

664
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,430
Well, to be fair, my dad
does his best fighting

665
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,796
when he's drunk.

666
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,396
Yeah, that's right.

667
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,836
Power five.

668
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,876
That was pretty weak, Jason.

669
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,906
I'm being honest with you.

670
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,676
I'll tell you-give you
a word of advice.

671
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,876
A man can always tell
how manly a man is

672
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,346
by how powerful his
power five is.

673
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,356
Thanks for those words of wisdom, Mr.
Slade.

674
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,856
That's great.

675
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
Roger.

676

Call me Roger.

677
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,566
I consider you t-to be
a son to me, you know?

678
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,830
A taller, better-looking son.

679
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,566
God, dad!

680
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,436
I'm joking!

681
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,636
Come on.

682
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,400
Let's go find some
fucking cannibals.

683
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,776
Hey, cannibals!

684
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Ok.

685
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,860
Just a little more quiet, maybe?

686
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,700
Hit me baby one more...

687
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,530
So this is it.

688
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,896
I should go on adventures
with you kids more often.

689
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,690
Shhh!

690
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,960
Bum-bum-bum-ba-ba-ba...

691
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,116
Mr. Slade!

692
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,746
You really need to be quiet!

693
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,586
Ok, you know what, Jason?

694
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,926
I'm super drunk and
I'm kinda high.

695
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,456
So being quiet is
really hard for me.

696

741
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,146
to close the door so she
can friggin' murder me?

742
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,586
You think about that, Lisa?

743
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,156
No. You didn't.

744
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,150
'Cause you didn't
finish high school.

745
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,996
Hey, Lisa?

746
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,696
Do we have any dessert?

747
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,920
Yeah, it's called get
some damn manners cake!

748
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,160
Well.

749
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,270
It's about damn time.

750
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,550
The fuck?

751
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
Fuck!

752
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,006
Stop it!

753
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,630
Stop it!

754
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
You're squeezing me!!!!

755
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,016
Shh...

756
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,326
Fuck.

757
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,896
Oh, fuck. Goddammit!

758
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,830
Be quiet, fucking piece of shit!

759
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,060
Fuck!

760
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,686
Ok, so what now?

761
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,746
Well, maybe we should-

762
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,686
Think we should split up
and cover more ground?

763
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,656
I was thinking the exact
same thing, my friend.

764
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,720
I was actually gonna say stick
together no matter what, but...

765
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,840
Jason?

766
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,966
You, my friend, are
a tactical genius.

767
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,296
That's why I would not
wanna play chess with you.

768
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,106
Also because chess
is fucking boring.

769
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,136
I do-I-I have to say, I
broke into this house

770
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,706
under the promise that I was
going to see some crazy shit.

771
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,416
So far, pretty disappointed
in the both of you.

772
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,916
So where is she, huh?

773
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,346
Where's the sexy cannibal?

774
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,186
Hey, Jason, Hey!

775
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,016
Come here! Come here!

776
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,886
Come on, boy.

777
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,826
I got-I got a good idea.

778
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,860
We should start a band
called Sexy Cannibals.

779
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,796
Huh?

780
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,830
I'm the guitar and
singer, obviously,

781
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,066
you play the drums,

782
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,836
Colin plays the bass, what's
her name plays whatever it is,

783
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,136
we go on tour, we play
some fuckin' shows,

784
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,706
we sleep in the van...

785
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,176
it's not as creepy as it
sounds, and we fuckin' party.

786
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,070
And we'll party all the days...
long days.

787
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,070
What if no one
goes to our shows?

788
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,186
Why wouldn't people
go to our shows...

789
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,350
should be the question
that you ask.

790
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,456
I just bought a drum
machine, actually-

791
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,056
You bought a-

792
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,796
Hey, guys! Come here!

793
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,296
What? No.

794
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,030
It's too far.

795
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,496
Ok, fine.

796
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,936
Stay there.

797
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,130
Just don't touch anything.

798
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,836
Jason?

799
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,960
Get your axe.

800
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,870
Get your axe, Jason.

801
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,740
You be careful with
that thing, buddy.

802
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,836
Woah.

803
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,036
Yeah.

804
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,200
Woah.

805
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,810
Ready?

806
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,950
Dad?!

807
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,230
Oh.

808
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,876
That's not good.

809
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,240
Yeah, no shit.

810
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,800
I don't...

811
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,046
He's still breathing.

812
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,156
Ok, good, good, good.

813
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,056
I think he drank some
of that drug wine.

814
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,456
Yeah, no shit, Jason.

815
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,090
Come on. Help him up.

816
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,866
Dad? Dad!

817
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,526
Dad.

818
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,866
Roger? Roger!

819
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,966
God.

820
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,436
Fuck, I hate you.

821
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,066
Let's move this table.

822
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,466
It's a fact, my dad's an idiot.

823
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,236
Maybe he'll be fine in
a few hours or days.

824
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,906
I don't know that much
about drugs, but...

825
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,276
That's hoping that psycho
doesn't mind having

826
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,240
a 200 pound moron sitting
in her living room.

827
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,376
Come on, dad.

828
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,750
He's heavy.

829
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,056
Yeah, well, he's 40 and all he
does is watch cartoons and eat,

830
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,926
of course he's fuckin' heavy.

831
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,226
That's not working.

832
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,610
Well, what then?

833
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,036
Where are you going?

834
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,006
I'm locking the door in
case she comes back.

835
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,906
We're gonna have to hide him.

836
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,370
Close that door.

837
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,890
Fine.

838
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,410
What the hell?

839
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,056
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

840
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,496
Don't tell me you wanna
put him in there.

841
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Uh-uh.

842
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,366
I don't think we have a choice.

843
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,390
Fuck.

844
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,206
Actually, we can do
better than that.

845
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,976
That's... that's not good.

846
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,470
Jason?

847
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,156
Jason, just get the weapons.

848
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:52,620
Come on.

849
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,986
Come on!

850
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,586
Come on, come on.

851
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,110
Come on!

852
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,290
Ready?

853
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,286
Oh god, I'm sorry!

854
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,310
I'm sorry!

855
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,146
What the hell?!

856
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,086
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry!

857
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,150
I'm sorry!

858
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,586
I'm sorry!

859
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,486
I'm sorry!

860
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,486
You're gonna be sir,
I know first aid!

861
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,120
Woah!

862
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,130
Shit!

863
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,196
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

864
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,896
You know what?

865
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,466
No, no, no!

866
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,666
Ok, we need to help him.

867
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,336
Why?

868
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,006
Really?

869
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,030
Yes!

870
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,006
Woah!

871
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,516
Oh, Jesus!

872
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,540
Oh!

873
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,510
That was messed up.

874
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,176
Ok, ok, ok.

875
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,686
We gotta get-we gotta get dad.

876
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:28,710
Ok.

877
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:30,786
Come on.

878
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,856
Yeah.

879
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,626
So we're gonna go home,
grab the van, pick up dad,

880
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,390
and get the hell out of here.

881
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,360
Ok.

882
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,320
Get him...

883
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,726
No, Summer.

884
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,356
Please, I don't wanna-

885
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,296
Shut up, we're doing this.

886
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,680
Oh my god.

887
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,296
Come on.

888
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,090
Let's uh, squish it.

889
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,690
Shit.

890
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,376
Throw him in!

891
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,046
Now?

892
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,200
Come on, come on, let's go!

893
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,676
Summer!

894
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,476
Were those what I
think they were?

895
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,476
I don't know, because to
me those looked like-

896
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:08,916
Shit!

897
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,150
Come on, come on!

898
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,256
What?

899
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,256
What is it, honey?

900
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,206
What is it?

901
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,606
Is that a rat?

902
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:10,546
Drop it.

903
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:11,716
Drop it!

904
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,740
Ugh.

905
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:39,476
Dude, did you just
smell my hand?

906
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,810
What? No, I was just...
I was just sighing.

907
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,756
Colin? Colin!

908
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,780
Lisa?

909
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,256
Summer? Summer!

910
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:56,656
Summ-

911
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,910
Colin? Lisa?

912
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,746
Lisa!

913
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,810
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

914
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,046
I- I didn't like her or anything

915
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,016
but I didn't want
her to turn into...

916
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:24,886
Colin!

917
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,020
We have to find Colin.

918
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,390
No, not again!

919
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,706
I think I'm gonna puke.

920
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,136
No, no, no.

921
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,370
What the hell?!

922
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,390
What the hell?

923
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,806
I think she's one of them.

924
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,346
Oh really?

925
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,846
What gave that away?

926
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,910
Fuck.

927
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,486
So, are we gonna-

928
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,586
Seriously, Jason?

929
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,456
Look, Lisa might be a bitch

930
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,556
but she's still my
dad's girlfriend.

931
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,850
Maybe we can, I don't know,
save her, or... the...

932
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,366
Oh, I think when the blood's
black there's no going back.

933
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,336
Now's the time you decide to
develop a sense of humour?

934
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,666
Sorry, I'm just trying to
state the obvious, here!

935
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,436
I'm sorry Miss...

936
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,936
I don't know what
Lisa's last name is!

937
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,290
Wait.

938
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,300
Wait.

939
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,300
Lisa?

940
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,810
Oh shit!

941
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,786
Jason!

942
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,010
Do something!

943
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,510
Uh...

944
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:42,950
Oh my god.

945
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,466
Ah!

946
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:47,936
I'm sorry!

947
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,736
I'm sorry!

948
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,760
Jesus!

949
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,936
Jason!

950
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,506
Get her off me!

951
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,530
Get her off!

952
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:01,940
This is so messed up!

953
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,940
Shit!

954
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,990
Jason, Jason, where
are you going?

955
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,696
Woah.

956
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,126
Woah, woah, woah!

957
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:14,966
Wait, wait!

958
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,060
Aaaaaggh!

959
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,150
Oh my god!

960
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,860
Holy shit!

961
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:33,876
Colin!

962
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,586
Get out of the way!

963
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,150
I've never done this before!

964
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:39,886
Holy shit!

965
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:40,910
What?

966
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,610
Lisa!

967
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,490
Did I get her?

968
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:48,726
Fuck.

969
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,266
Colin.

970
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,196
Colin, I thought...

971
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:50,996
I know, I know.

972
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,736
I know.

973
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,966
The neighbour, she was
here and then... and-

974
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,676
and I was peeing but then I-

975
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,606
she was doing something
to Lisa and I got scared

976
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,576
and I ran away and I
heard you guys screaming

977
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,716
and then I came in and then
Lisa was acting all crazy

978
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,880
and then she was trying
to kill you guys

979
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,100
so I just... I just...

980
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,050
did I just kill Lisa?

981
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,650
Dude, it's ok, man.

982
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,626
I- I think I peed my pants.

983
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,996
Oh, gross.

984
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:21,796
Whatever, man.

985
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,966
I mean, you're covered in, like,

986
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,660
blood and brains and shit.

987
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,630
So where's dad?

988
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:30,690
What?

989
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:32,436
He's back at her place.

990
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,976
You left him back there?!

991
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,906
What, is he dead, too?

992
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:35,846
No, no, he's not dead,

993
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,816
he's safe and we're
going back to get him.

994
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,016
Look, he's not
dead, you hear me?

995
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,646
Why is he even there?

996
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,910
He drank some of the drugged
wine and then he passed out.

997
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,780
Fuck.

998
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,910
That's not my house, you know.

999
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,166
The cabin?

1000
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,196
No, the one you
always pick me up at.

1001
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,650
The dump?

1002
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:02,636
Yeah.

1003
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,536
No, I actually...

1004
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,976
I live in this big house
on Berksley Street

1005
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,940
and my parents are loaded.

1006
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,046
Well, whatever man, I
mean mine are, too.

1007
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,986
No, I mean they're money
loaded, not drunk loaded.

1008
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,010
Oh.

1009
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,126
My dad's a dick and he
treats my mom like crap

1010
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:30,030
and, you know, they're
probably getting a divorce.

1011
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:33,036
This morning I left and I didn't
tell them where I was going

1012
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:38,806
and uh... now I might die

1013
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,276
and I don't even know if
they'll really give a shit.

1014
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,076
Whatever, man.

1015
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:47,316
I mean, my parents are divorced.

1016
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,016
And who knows? I mean, maybe...

1017
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,656
maybe your dad'll get
an undead girlfriend

1018
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,956
and you'll get to blow
her brains out, too.

1019
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,190
Colin, what?

1020
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,756
Well, I don't know, I'm nervous!

1021
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,220
And I talk too much
when I'm nervous.

1022
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,936
Wait, so you lied to me?

1023
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,806
I'm, like, your best friend
and I tell you the truth

1024
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:13,840
about everything and... like
that time when I wiped my ass

1025
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,206
with Dave's toothbrush
because he-

1026
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,146
he cheated on magic.

1027
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:21,186
I was just... trying
to fit in, I guess.

1028
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,950
By pretending to be poor?

1029
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,156
That is so weird, man.

1030
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,926
It's... weird.

1031
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:32,826
You know, your family,
it might look messed up

1032
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,826
but you guys actually
love each other,

1033
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:37,366
like deep down somewhere.

1034
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,106
You guys are more like my
real family, you know?

1035
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,930
You sensitive bitch.

1036
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:51,616
That was some seriously
deep shit, dude.

1037
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,916
I love you, man.

1038
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,850
You too, man.

1039
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,340
Cute.

1040
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,956
You know, Mr. Slade,

1041
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,656
maybe he drinks too much

1042
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,226
and he swears and he's
not very responsible-

1043
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,726
He farts in my face
sometimes, but...

1044
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,096
But he loves you guys,

1045
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,296
and he actually gives
a crap about me.

1046
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,306
Well, enough to make fun of me

1047
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:18,406
and tell me when I'm
getting stepped all over.

1048
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,206
So we're not gonna let
some crazy cannibal lady

1049
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,876
take him away from us.

1050
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,746
We're gonna go back there and
we're gonna mess her up!

1051
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,416
She's not even that hot, anyway.

1052
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,250
So where'd you get the gun?

1053
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,836
Just in here.

1054
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,706
By the way, shotgun.

1055
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:52,100
As in, shotgun the shotgun.

1056
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,716
Woah.

1057
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,016
Let's gear up.

1058
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,956
And blow some bros.

1059
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,356
You're gonna blow
some bros, Colin?

1060
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,386
Blow up some bros.

1061
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,756
You know what I mean.

1062
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,080
Yeah.

1063
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,946
Let's fuck shit up!

1064
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:07,676
Woah.

1065
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,146
Someone's balls just dropped.

1066
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,666
This is a pretty shitty weekend.

1067
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,406
I'm gonna say it because all
we've been doing is walking up

1068
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,940
and down this path, we've seen
some pretty disgusting shit

1069
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,176
like blood and gore, you
know, and now it's snowing.

1070
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,916
I got snow in my shoes, and...

1071
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,280
I pissed my pants earlier

1072
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,316
and you guys wouldn't
let me clean it.

1073
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,916
So fuck you guys for that.

1074
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,186
Sweeties!

1075
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,856
Stop it. Stop it.

1076
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,486
Get down.

1077
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,386
They're the bros.

1078
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:51,256
Yeah, yeah.

1079
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,226
She fished them out
of the basement.

1080
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,166
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

1081
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,796
You're gonna pay for
what you did to Lisa!

1082
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,496
Yeah!

1083
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,090
We're gonna tell on you!

1084
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,170
"We're gonna tell on you"?

1085
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:08,046
The cops don't know,
the cops don't care.

1086
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:11,016
They'll never suspect
me, they're all sexist.

1087
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:12,980
Fuck!

1088
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,516
Shit!

1089
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,540
Split up! Split up!

1090
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,950
You're out of your league, kids!

1091
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,780
Alright, come on.

1092
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,270
I want you to get them, huh?

1093
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,026
Go get 'em.

1094
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,280
Go on, boys.

1095
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:29,766
Go on.

1096
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,536
Go get 'em, boys.

1097
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,900
Go get 'em.

1098
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,606
Do you have any snacks?

1099
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,106
I- I ate all my hot dogs
and I'm so fuckin' hungry.

1100
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,106
No, I don't have
any snacks, man.

1101
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,130
Fuck.

1102
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,570
Oh, goddammit, Harold, stop it.

1103
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,300
Come on, honey.

1104
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,086
You go make me proud.

1105
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:53,020
Make me proud, honey.

1106
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,186
I got one!

1107
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,210
Get down!

1108
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:45,930
Oh, fuck.

1109
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,636
Shit. Shit.

1110
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,476
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

1111
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:53,580
Holy shit!

1112
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,286
Check mate, biatch!

1113
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,310
Fuck!

1114
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,326
Yo, she-bitch!

1115
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,096
I got her!

1116
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,076
Oh, disgusting!

1117
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,646
Guys, guys!

1118
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,146
Where's the neighbour?

1119
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,570
Wha-

1120
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,956
I don't know, but
let's go and get dad!

1121
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:39,996
Ah, fuck.

1123
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,460
Now I got piss and
blood all over me.

1124
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,720
Wha-what's with
all the unicorns?

1125
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,200
Fuck unicorns.

1126
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:45,356
Where's dad?

1127
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,610
Dad's under the stairs.

1128
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,376
He's coming!

1129
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,570
Who's coming?

1130
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,080
Summer.

1131
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,270
Who's coming?

1132
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,300
Fuck.

1133
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,270
The fuck is she talking about?

1134
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,620
Holy shit.

1135
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,336
Shit!

1136
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:26,966
Shit.

1137
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,406
Um, Jason, hold the door.

1138
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:30,170
Colin, help me out here.

1139
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,190
Ok.

1140
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,230
Come on.

1141
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,560
Ok, come on, come on.

1142
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:57,366
Summer.

1143
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:59,096
Summer, where's dad?

1144
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,596
Where are we going?

1145
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,266
Shh!

1146
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,336
Guys, where are you going?

1147
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,470
What're you doing?

1148
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:04,236
Guys?

1149
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,176
Shh!

1150
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,800
Shut up!

1151
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,846
Creepy kids!

1152
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,250
Hey, you guys look cool.

1153
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:24,526
What's up with the crack babies?

1154
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,590
Dad, stay down!

1155
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,366
Ah gross!

1156
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,626
Dad, come on!

1157
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:30,396
Come on!

1158
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,136
Is that blood?

1159
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:31,696
Yes!

1160
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,866
Because fucking dead!

1161
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,506
What do you mean, fucking dead?

1162
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:36,906
Is that... blood on you, too?

1163
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,406
Dad, I need your help!

1164
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,376
What happened to the room?

1165
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,276
What-ok, why is there a couch-

1166
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,146
What?

1167
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:43,410
Bring it-Colin, help
me bring it down.

1168
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:44,206
What?

1169
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,776
No, dad, I need you to help me!

1170
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,570
Just stop yelling.

1171
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,716
Hey, Colin.

1172
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,350
Hey.

1173
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:50,916
Buddy.

1174
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,686
Hey. Hey!

1175
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:52,686
I'm trying to-woah.

1176
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,486
Look...

1177
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,886
Come on, bash her skull in!

1178
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,156
You know I love
you, buddy, right?

1179
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,256
Yeah.

1180
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,896
A- And-And I know I can act
dumb sometimes, right?

1181
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,566
I'm trying!

1182
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,730
And I know I should
probably act more mature.

1183
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:04,726
Y- yeah.

1184
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,336
I just wanna be the fun dad.

1185
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,806
You know, the-the cool dad.

1186
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,266
Alright?

1187
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:09,906
Come on, Jason!

1188
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,036
It's just a little girl!

1189
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,706
But it's... it's hard, you
know, your mother and I...

1190
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:15,806
Uh-huh, yeah.

1191
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:16,606
That's why this is so messed up!

1192
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:18,916
I just want you
to know that I...

1193
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,786
I love you and your
sister very much.

1194
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,186
Ok, dad, we love you, too.

1195
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,256
Ok, good stuff.

1196
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,186
Good talk.

1197
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,210
And I...

1198
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,936
S- Summer, what did you do?

1199
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,236
What did you do?

1200
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,576
Ok, dad, we gotta get
out of here now.

1201
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,646
Come on.

1202
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,346
Where's Lisa?

1203
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,976
Dad. Dad.

1204
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,330
Lisa's gone.

1205
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,250
What do you mean, she's gone?

1206
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,446
What do you...

1207
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:59,416
She turned into one of those
and then Colin had to...

1208
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,440
Colin had to what?

1209
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,726
Colin? Colin?

1210
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,996
Colin had to what?

1211
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:06,696
Look, dad, you can increase your
chances of meeting someone new

1212
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,760
if we get out of here alive.

1213
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:12,996
Oh... yeah, alright.

1214
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,206
What is that?

1215
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,976
Ok, dad, help me with the door!

1216
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,746
What the fuck is that?

1217
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,410
Help me with the fucking door!

1218
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,286
Fuck, I hate axes!

1219
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,776
My babies!

1220
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,540
What did you do to my babies?!

1221
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,560
Colin, gun!

1222
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:58,916
Shit!

1223
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,940
I didn't reload it!

1224
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:10,610
Fuck!

1225
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,666
I liked Lisa, you fucking bitch!

1226
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,690
Here's another one!

1227
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,940
Dad!

1228
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,970
Are you ok?

1229
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:41,020
She fucking stabbed me!

1230
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,326
Fuck off with the
throwing the knives!

1231
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,556
Fuck.

1232
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,666
Is it bad?

1233
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,626
You got stabbed!

1234
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:50,126
Yeah, it's bad.

1235
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:50,896
It's pretty bad!

1236
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,636
It's pretty bad.

1237
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,660
Yeah.

1238
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,560
Idiot!

1239
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,630
Stay!

1240
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,710
I think we're done here.

1241
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,556
Summer!

1242
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,956
Summer, dad's hurt!

1243
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,626
Fuck.

1244
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:21,996
Shit.

1245
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:23,630
Oh my god, dad!

1246
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,496
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you out of here!

1247
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,066
Shit, he's losing
a lot of blood.

1248
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,436
Fuck!

1249
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,636
Summer, don't use that
kind of language,

1250
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,370
it doesn't suit you.

1251
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:30,966
Guys, guys!

1252
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,106
Car keys!

1253
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:33,650
There's, like, a ton
of cars out there!

1254
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,876
Alright, dad, dad, BRB.

1255
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,946
What does that mean?

1256
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,340
Jason, stay with dad!

1257
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,090
I gotta-I gotta find something
to stop this bleeding.

1258
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,766
Duct tape.

1259
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,966
It really is good
for everything.

1260
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:04,036
Stay with me, Roger.

1261
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,066
You're gonna be ok, alright?

1262
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:08,946
Hey, you called me-you
called me by first name.

1263
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,816
P- power five.

1264
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,146
Ow.

1265
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,046
You nailed it.

1266
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,186
Dad, we got a car.

1267
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,050
Is it nice?

1268
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,470
Yes.

1269
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,126
You always were my
favourite, Colin.

1270
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:24,426
I hate you.

1271
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,450
No you don't.

1272
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:01,150
Dad!!!!!!!!

1273
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,690
Dad!!!!!

1274
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,066
Dad!!!!!!

1275
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:13,206
Guys, guys, let's go, now!

1276
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:14,006
Now! Now!

1277
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,090
Now!

1278
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:32,520
That was my family you just
killed, you little shit!

1279
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,796
Ten years.

1280
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,136
Ten years of feeding,
caring for them.

1281
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,666
Do you have any idea
how hard it was?

1282
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:44,966
And did I get any thank yous?

1283
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,240
No!

1284
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,106
Not one fucking thank you!

1285
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:52,916
Oh, bitch, you're so dramatic!

1286
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,780
But they loved me!

1287
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,046
They really loved me!

1288
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,286
Who's gonna love me now, huh?

1289
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,310
Who?

1290
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:05,940
Who cares?

1291
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,540
That was for Roger.

1292
