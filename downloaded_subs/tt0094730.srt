1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,960
THE VISITORS

2
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,640
Wow, what an incredible
sound this thing puts out!

3
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,500
It cost a little more, but it was worth it.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,900
There's no distortion.

5
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,800
Give me back my chocolate!

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Careful, kids.
This is a brand new car.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,700
Peter, look at your face!

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,300
Come over here so I can clean you off.

9
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,000
What are they up to now?

10
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,700
He's making a mess of the
upholstery! Stop it, Peter!

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
- Stop it right now, you hear?
- Will you take care of this?

12
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,800
Behave yourself, or you'll
get a good spanking!

13
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,400
- Now hold still.
- Jesus, you're driving me crazy!

14
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Are you mad at us?

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Mad? I wish you two
would learn to behave.

16
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,000
This is not a joke.

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
See what you did?

18
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,000
Sit still, Lotta.

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,000
There it is!

20
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,500
See it?

21
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,900
Smell that air. Fresh and clean.

22
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,930
Amazing...

23
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,900
- Do you like it?
- Frank, it's fantastic.

24
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,900
What do you think, kiddo?

25
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,500
I have chocolate on my shirt.

26
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, well...

27
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,900
Give me the keys, Sara.

28
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:06,190
Don't you have them?

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,100
Why would I have them?

30
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,600
You had them when we packed this morning.

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes it was.

32
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Damn... Oh here they are.

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
No problem.

34
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,800
How would you guys manage without me?

35
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,520
I don't want chocolate on my shirt.

36
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Stupid, you're the one who put
it there in the first place.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,300
We'll wash it.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,300
- Now, wash it now.
- Be quiet, you big cry-baby.

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm stunned, look how
they fixed up the place.

40
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,700
- Surprised, are you?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
Lucky we didn't have to do it ourselves.

42
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,300
Really.

43
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,480
That's what happens when you're a bigshot.

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,680
Sure... Don't forget you still
have work to do upstairs.

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,840
That's just a little wallpaper.
I'll have it up in 15 minutes.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
- How do you feel?
- Perfect.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,400
- Then why do you look so worried?
- I'm not, I'm very composed.

48
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,390
Yeah, sure you are...
Stop worrying.

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Watch, by next week I'll
have that campaign locked up.

50
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,300
- You sure?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,850
If I didn't believe in my ideas,
we wouldn't be here.

52
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,270
You'll see, money will flow in.

53
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,400
- You promise?
- Very soon, I give you my word.

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,840
So let's enjoy our weekend and
on Monday I'll get started, okay?

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

56
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,300
- All is good then?
- Yes, it is.

57
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,800
Where is our room?

58
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,300
It's upstairs.

59
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,500
What's Peter doing?

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,380
He's unpacking his toys.

61
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,500
Oh, god.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,350
What do you think of the house, princess?

63
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:01,000
It's big.

64
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,300
Are we the only ones
who are gonna live here?

65
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,300
I certainly hope so.

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,000
Hello there.

67
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,600
- Here's your mail.
- Oh, thanks.

68
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,500
Great service you provide here.

69
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,869
One time only.

70
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,800
You have to put a box near the front gate.

71
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,800
You mean all the way down by the road?

72
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, I'm a journalist and usually
get a lot of mail every day...

73
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:58,350
Would you do us a favour
and bring it up here?

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,790
I guess... But wait...

75
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,800
You'll have to put a mailbox
so I can drive right up to it.

76
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:13,800
- I won't get out of the car.
- No, no, you won't have to.

77
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,800
That's very sweet of you.

78
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Hey, no problem.

79
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,092
(Silly accent) Wallpaper paste!

80
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,798
Don't do that daddy...

81
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:49,251
First you climb the ladder then you
push the wallpaper like this...

82
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,171
Damn you kids, laughing at me like that...

83
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:57,914
You just put it up like this... damn... shit!

84
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,436
- How's it going?
- Damn well, can't you see?

85
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:10,079
Yeees, it looks amazing... not a single
crooked wallpaper.

86
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:14,462
Well... aren't you cocky.

87
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:17,341
Just watch this professional in action.

88
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,212
First you take the wallpaper like this...

89
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,873
...then to prepare the wallpaper you
put it on your head.

90
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:31,450
Make a little hole like this...

91
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:39,031
Strike a pose like this, keep moving...

92
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:47,378
Then just lean back and enjoy the...
eh... brush like this...

93
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:57,469
What, you're laughing at me?
I fell on my ass and you're laughing?

94
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,841
Don't laugh at the greatest
painter in the world!

95
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,475
No... no, Frank!

96
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:19,285
Seriously, isn't it nice?

97
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:24,916
Who was that at the door?

98
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:28,008
At the door? Oh, the mailman, he
wanted us to get a mailbox.

99
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:32,205
Did we get anything interesting?

100
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,501
Yes...

101
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:42,069
- Bills... electricity, telephone, water...
- All right, that's enough.

102
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:49,563
- When's your appointment tomorrow?
- 9 A.M.

103
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,100
- Didn't you forget anything?
- No.

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
You sure?

105
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, those...

106
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,300
- Good luck, baby.
- In the bag.

107
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,400
What's all that?

108
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:12,900
Oh, dear...

109
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,900
Frank, can you buy a mailbox?

110
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:20,050
Yeah, but he doesn't have to
throw the mail on the ground, the idiot.

111
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,000
See you tonight.

112
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,900
Don't forget the mailbox!

113
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Mommy, mommy!

114
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,823
Something happened upstairs.

115
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:58,000
- Come and see.
- What is it?

116
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,930
Daddy's gonna be mad when he see this.

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Hello!

118
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
Hi!

119
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:42,000
- Where's the booze?
- On the bookshelf.

120
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,530
- Why the hell is it over here?
- You put it there yourself.

121
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,850
No luck, huh?

122
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,830
No.

123
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,400
They didn't think my
ideas were original enough.

124
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
- I knew it, I just knew it.
- Oh, you did, did you?

125
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
When did you become a psychic?

126
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,800
Don't be so sarcastic.

127
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,000
How are we gonna pay for all this?

128
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,600
- The car, the house...
- Stop it.

129
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,900
I haven't finished yet.

130
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,000
They're giving me another chance.

131
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,180
I have until friday to come up with
some new ideas.

132
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm just not sure where to start.

133
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,300
You never know where to start.

134
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,600
Mommy?

135
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,500
We're hungry.

136
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm sorry for what I said before.

137
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
You'll come up with something.
You always do.

138
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,400
If we talk about it a little,
maybe you'll get an idea.

139
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,800
You can tell me some more about it.

140
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:16,500
I only know that it's a
campaign for that insurance company.

141
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,400
Stay at home this week and think about it.

142
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,900
You need some place quiet.
Without any more pressure.

143
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Your secretary can take your calls.

144
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,400
Mommy, we saw a program about
peacocks on TV today.

145
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,190
Did you know the peacock's
tail feathers are 80 inches long?

146
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,300
Really? You don't say.

147
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,700
Yes, the male spreads his tail
for the female so they can mate.

148
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,900
In this house we say, "Fuck!"

149
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,590
Is that what we say?

150
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,790
Where did you learn that?

151
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,220
I'm glad you're staying home so you
can fix the wallpaper in our room.

152
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,000
What?

153
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,880
It all fell down.

154
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,800
Frank?

155
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,000
Are you hurt?

156
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,300
You scared the shit out of me!

157
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,840
What were you doing down there?

158
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:44,000
I heard something scratching in the wall.

159
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,600
Thought it was a rat.

160
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,160
In the wall?

161
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,600
Yeah, in the pipes.

162
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,740
I read about a lady who had a
rat this big crawl right out of her toilet.

163
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,500
Frank, I doubt we have
any rats in our pipes.

164
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,100
Come to bed. You'll think more
clearly in the morning.

165
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,600
That paper should stick now.
I used twice as much glue.

166
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
That's good.

167
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,200
I can't seem to come up with a new idea.

168
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:05,100
My head is completely empty.

169
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:11,000
We need that damn contract.
Our future depends on it.

170
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,720
You should have thought about that before.

171
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,500
Cut it out.

172
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,100
You wanted to move here as much as me.

173
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,500
But I thought we should wait
a while, you know that.

174
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, right, here it comes.
Suddenly it's all my fault.

175
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,420
You didn't object when we were planning it.

176
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,120
And that was a mistake.

177
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,500
I should have protested, but
I never have a say around here.

178
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,980
Now that's a lot of bull and you know it.

179
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
Come on, you have a mouth.
You can say anything you want.

180
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,200
It doesn't help if you won't listen.

181
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,230
So now I'm a son of a bitch.

182
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,350
No, you're not...

183
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,900
But sometimes it's a bit much
when everything is all about you.

184
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,100
It's always your home, your car,
your job, your ideas...

185
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,700
There are others around here.

186
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,000
That's why I'm doing this,
for you and the kids.

187
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,950
You don't understand.

188
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,675
I guess I'm just too stupid.

189
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:09,425
What the hell, it's always my fault.

190
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:12,000
I was trying to talk about this
and we end up arguing.

191
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,175
Thanks so much for your damn support!

192
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:16,000
Thank you very much!

193
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,000
Sara?

194
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,300
What on earth?

195
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:13,300
What the hell is this?

196
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,080
Did you try glue?

197
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,600
Very funny.

198
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,620
It smells like something metallic or...

199
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,330
electrical, I think.

200
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,360
Where's it coming from?

201
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,100
Maybe you used too much glue.

202
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Listen, I know what I'm doing.

203
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,600
Well, if that's so...

204
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,500
Let me do what I do,
go away and do what you're doing.

205
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,900
So lay off and I'll put
up the damn paper again!

206
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,500
Why the hell did you call for me then?

207
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,000
Fucking wallpaper!

208
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,080
Frank?

209
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:55,806
- Sorry.
- Why did you turn on the light?

210
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,800
Never mind, it's nothing.

211
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Want a cigarette?

212
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,000
No.

213
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,400
Do you have to smoke in here?

214
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,700
Want something to drink?

215
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
I'm trying to sleep.

216
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,000
Right, sorry.

217
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,400
Fuck!

218
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
What are you doing?

219
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
That's great, Frank.

220
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,740
You spilled beer all over me!

221
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,940
There's something weird going on.

222
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,900
You got that right.

223
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,900
It's called Frank.

224
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,800
Turn off the light.

225
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
But... every time I walk past...

226
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Frank, I'm trying to sleep.

227
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,000
Please turn out the light.

228
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,100
Sara?

229
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,400
Maybe it's haunted.

230
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,500
Go to sleep.

231
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,700
Move over to your side, Peter.

232
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,990
I wanna sit behind daddy.

233
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,500
- Watch it!
- What the hell are you doing?

234
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,500
- What?
- Why did you throw the mail on the ground?

235
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,770
You have no box!

236
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,050
Don't just drop it in the dirt
because of that, you dumb fuck!

237
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,822
You have no box!

238
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:24,822
You expect your mail to be
delivered in bed?

239
00:27:24,953 --> 00:27:26,100
Get a mailbox.

240
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,982
What kind of idiots work at
the post office nowadays?

241
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,500
I'll get a mailbox.
But until then,

242
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
stop throwing the mail in the dirt.

243
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,200
- Suppose it...
- You should be grateful

244
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,500
I'm even willing to drive up here.

245
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Suppose it rains?

246
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,000
Well?

247
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
Then I'll bring it in to you.

248
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,900
Bravo, you're finally getting the message.

249
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,900
Do the same when the sun is out
and I'll buy your damn mailbox.

250
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,000
Asshole.

251
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Jerk.

252
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,008
- Peter?
- I want this one.

253
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,699
- No, no, no... No toys today.
- Please, daddy.

254
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:38,237
No, I said. Daddy can't
afford that, put it back.

255
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,937
But I want it!

256
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,661
No, I said. Another time.

257
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,805
That's what you always say.

258
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:56,770
- Allright, take it then.
- Thank you, daddy!

259
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:04,027
$30 bucks for that, it's ridiculus.
No, you'll have to put it back.

260
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:09,638
- But you promised I could have it.
- $30 dollars is too much.

261
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:12,121
Let's go.

262
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,994
- Take the car then.
- I don't want it anymore.

263
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:27,050
Don't start. I'm saying you can have the car.

264
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:34,311
We were supposed to buy
a magazine for mommy as well.

265
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,065
Wait here then.

266
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,200
Excuse me.

267
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,750
Thanks.

268
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:07,850
Don't forget to pay for that.

269
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:16,336
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
GHOST HUNTER

270
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:20,777
THE OCCULT

271
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
Frank?

272
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,100
Yeah.

273
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,300
Come here a minute.

274
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,800
What is it?

275
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,400
Why did you buy so much milk?

276
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I thought it was a good idea to have extra.

277
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,900
Half of it will go bad
before we can drink it.

278
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,700
Well sorry then!
I'll just have to drink it all myself.

279
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,950
- Did you buy a mailbox?
- Damn, I knew I forgot something.

280
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,010
Right, but you can buy a toy for Peter.

281
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,470
What the hell am I supposed to do when he
makes a scene in the middle of the store.

282
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:01,699
I thought we agreed

283
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
not to bend the rules
every time he throws a fit.

284
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
Right...

285
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,900
By the way...
do we have any wire hangers?

286
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,550
Yes.

287
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,200
What about it?

288
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Just wondering.

289
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
What are you doing, daddy?
What's that?

290
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,600
What do you think it looks like?

291
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,900
An old man.

292
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,150
Yeah, I guess it does look like an old man.

293
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,240
My father used to make these
for me when I was a kid.

294
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,000
Grandpa? But he's dead!

295
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,900
- Who's that?
- He was my father.

296
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,500
You never met him.

297
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,500
I did... His hair was white.

298
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,250
Yes it was, but not when I was little.

299
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:14,400
He looked a lot like me back then.

300
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,970
Well, let's not talk about that anymore.

301
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,500
Here's a present from daddy.

302
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,850
You can teach this old man
how to drive your car.

303
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,000
Thank you, daddy.

304
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,534
Can I have a look, daddy?

305
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,460
Lotta, come help me set the table.

306
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,800
Go help mommy.

307
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:22,000
Sara!

308
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:26,100
- What is it?
- Sara come here!

309
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,000
- What's happening?
- Get up here quick!

310
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,800
What is it?

311
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,000
What happened? What is it?

312
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,270
- Why won't you answer me?
- There! What's that?

313
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,000
What's what?

314
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,700
Have you lost your mind?

315
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,000
They disappeared.

316
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,500
What?

317
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,300
Footprints.

318
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,700
There were wet footprints
all over the floor!

319
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
Frank, calm down.

320
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,000
Something was here!
Don't tell me to calm down!

321
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,560
There were marks! Something left
slimy footprints in my attic!

322
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,800
Frank, come on.

323
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,460
Wait a minute!

324
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:22,400
- Not in front of the kids.
- Why don't you believe me?

325
00:35:22,644 --> 00:35:24,500
Come on, it's nothing.

326
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:27,800
- Why is daddy so mad?
- Mommy, tell me!

327
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,340
It's nothing. Let's go eat.

328
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,760
- Are you coming?
- Later.

329
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,443
- Dinner's ready now, Frank.
- Listen, I'm not hungry.

330
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,900
- Occult Magazine.
- Yes, my name is...

331
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'd like to speak to someone named...

332
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,000
Allan Svensson.

333
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,330
It's regarding an article he wrote.

334
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,000
Thanks.

335
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,180
- Allan Svensson.
- Yes, hi...

336
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,000
My name is Frank Eriksson.

337
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,300
I read your article on wire hangers

338
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,900
and cold spots pinpointing spirits.

339
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
- That one. Listen...
- Can you speak up a bit?

340
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,990
I really can't right now.

341
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,000
What about the article?
Did you like it?

342
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,400
Yes, very good.

343
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,100
In fact, I'm calling about...

344
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,310
I'm sure this will sound ridiculous,

345
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,310
but my family and I just moved into a new

346
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,370
house and some strange things
have been happening around here.

347
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,150
Really? Such as?

348
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,370
Well, there's this room that
keeps rejecting wallpaper.

349
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,560
Is that right?
Are you putting it up properly?

350
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,700
Yes, but there's been a lot of
other bizarre things going on.

351
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,120
Listen, Frank... Maybe I
should drive out to see you?

352
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:21,820
Yeah?

353
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,630
- Come here?
- Would that be a problem?

354
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,520
No, I guess not...
See you tomorrow.

355
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:57,200
Frank?

356
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:03,820
Everything seems to be going wrong.

357
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,000
What worries me most is you.

358
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,000
Me?

359
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,200
You've never been like this.

360
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,200
Well, it's not so strange when you consider

361
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,100
what's going on here at night.

362
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,900
Where is this obsession
of yours coming from?

363
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,910
- It's like you've forgotten...
- What do you mean forgotten?

364
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,100
- I haven't forgotten a thing.
- Calm down.

365
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,600
I am calm.
But there are things...

366
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,000
Frank, you get yourself all
worked up over nothing.

367
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,300
I know how you feel.

368
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,700
Everything's spinning out of
control and you can't concentrate.

369
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,000
Listen...

370
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,850
How about tomorrow we take the kids

371
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,650
for a nice long walk in the woods

372
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,750
and we can talk this over
and clear the air.

373
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:09,000
It would really help.
It'll be like a new beginning.

374
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,530
How about it?

375
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,190
Then you have to promise you'll

376
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,000
stop talking about weird noises
and strange sights.

377
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,500
Now, go to sleep so you'll have
some energy in the morning.

378
00:41:49,545 --> 00:41:51,000
Hello?

379
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,000
It's me...

380
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,000
The mailman.

381
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,100
This is pissing me off...

382
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,000
Hi.

383
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,100
I thought I heard someone in here.

384
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,100
I can hardly wait.

385
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,100
Have you located them yet?

386
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,000
Well, they're not here.

387
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:09,500
Oh? Then where are they?

388
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,500
How the hell should I know?

389
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,500
Why, have they disappeared?

390
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,000
I don't know where they are,
for chrissakes.

391
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,900
You think I follow them around?

392
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,780
I don't give a shit about what they do.
Mostly, they fight.

393
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
What was that?

394
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,000
They argue?

395
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,500
Yeah... about the mailbox.

396
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,900
The mailbox?

397
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,170
Oh, is that where they've moved?

398
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,000
Am I missing something here?
They haven't even bought one.

399
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,437
One of them screamed like crazy
at me yesterday.

400
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,100
What did you say?

401
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,600
You mean you can see them move around?

402
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,360
They just wander throughout the whole area?

403
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,100
Well, I have to be going.

404
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,000
No, no, no, wait.
Don't run off.

405
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,150
We have to sort this out.

406
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,870
You're saying they moved.

407
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,370
I'm sure they'll be back.

408
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,170
We can't let this chance slip away.

409
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,500
I've got equipment in the car to trap them!

410
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,200
Once we have them trapped,
we'll examine them. I'll take photos!

411
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:21,500
Then we'll zap them with a
blast of electricity! Bzzzt!

412
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,300
Are you joking?

413
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,340
Of course not... I don't joke.

414
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,500
Everybody thinks I'm joking.
I have no idea why!

415
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,480
I can't begin to understand this.

416
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,600
It's very simple.

417
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,000
We have to get them
before they come after us.

418
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,300
Who knows?

419
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,500
They might be listening
to us right this minute.

420
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,700
Wait, what the hell are you talking about?

421
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
Those cold spots of yours, of course.

422
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,000
Hey you!

423
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,700
There's a freak in here!

424
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,960
I think he's nuts.

425
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,900
Oh!

426
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:18,951
Hi.

427
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,440
Who are you?

428
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,140
Allan.

429
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,520
You know, from "Occult Magazine"?

430
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,020
Oh, you're the one.

431
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,140
We spoke on the phone.

432
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,075
- I'm Frank.
- Sure, hi.

433
00:45:34,175 --> 00:45:35,475
So, you found your way here.

434
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:38,435
No, only my spirit.
I'm still at home in bed.

435
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:44,700
Glad you two seem to be hitting it off.

436
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,180
Now...
you still don't have a mailbox.

437
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,300
The weather looked bad,
so I put the mail on your table.

438
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,013
Whoops!

439
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,500
Have a nice day...

440
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,000
if possible.

441
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,500
So, now that I'm here,
let's go check the wallpaper.

442
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,100
Oh, sure.

443
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,400
Oh, right, this is my wife, Sara.

444
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,800
- Hi... Allan.
- Sara.

445
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,860
Well, I might as well bring in
the equipment.

446
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,320
I left it outside.

447
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,220
Gimme a hand, will ya?

448
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,475
- Sure.
- My god, Frank, did you hire a painter?

449
00:46:29,575 --> 00:46:33,500
- How do you expect us to pay him?
- Wait a minute, he isn't a paint...

450
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:47,600
- Can you handle this one?
- Sure.

451
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,100
- Where is the room?
- Upstairs.

452
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,000
Whoops!

453
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,000
You sure don't travel light
in your business.

454
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:36,000
Right, let's see...

455
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:28,700
What are these machines for?

456
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,000
These, my friends, register energy.

457
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,000
Energy?

458
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,900
Life.

459
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,800
Frank, come.

460
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,000
- What is it?
- Who is that man?

461
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,675
- It's silly, he wanted to come.
- Who is he?

462
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:04,500
- He's some kind of researcher.
- What kind?

463
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,000
- A ghost researcher.
- Well, everything's working.

464
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,370
Now we'll just have to wait and
see if anything turns up.

465
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:17,235
Oh, and it's important that we
stay out of the room

466
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,800
so nobody triggers the equipment.

467
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,000
Come on, kids.

468
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,340
Now, where can I put my overnight bag?

469
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,300
You think it'll take that long?

470
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,970
Well, if you want proper
readings, it certainly will.

471
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah, so...
where do we put the kids?

472
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,000
Put them where you sleep.

473
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,900
Most people don't realize
how little we know about...

474
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,100
ghosts and the supernatural.

475
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,500
The only time most of them get
a chance to find out about it

476
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,000
is after death.

477
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,900
Have you ever experienced
this kind of stuff yourself?

478
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,660
Oh, several times.

479
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,710
But a friend of mine

480
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,400
had a very nasty experience once.

481
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,900
What happened?

482
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,300
Demons.

483
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,000
Demons?

484
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
He decided to spend an evening

485
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,000
in one of those really old haunted houses.

486
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,360
The family who lived there

487
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,500
had mysteriously disappeared.

488
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,700
But the house was still left

489
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
just like they still lived there.

490
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,600
The same night they disappeared

491
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,300
a horrible scream was heard.

492
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,900
Coming from that house.

493
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,300
So he sat there, in the middle of the night,

494
00:52:42,335 --> 00:52:45,200
with nothing but a burning candle.

495
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,820
But suddenly,

496
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,100
a mysterious wind blew

497
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,250
through the room and the candle went out.

498
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:58,000
He's trying to find it in
the dark but it is gone.

499
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,900
Suddenly he hears a sound...

500
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,600
coming from somewhere in the house.

501
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,750
It sounded

502
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,780
...big. Heavy.

503
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,900
It is moving closer to the
room he's sitting in.

504
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,900
He turns around towards the door

505
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,230
he can see it slowly, slowly, slowly...

506
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,600
starting to open.

507
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,500
What the hell was that?

508
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,100
Don't know.

509
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,000
Something triggered the equipment.

510
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,000
But what?

511
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,800
What the hell could have done it?

512
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,000
That's what we're going find out.

513
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,100
What's that?

514
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,000
What's that?

515
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,700
- Where?
- Behind the door.

516
00:57:24,035 --> 00:57:26,100
I don't know, it's locked.

517
00:58:39,873 --> 00:58:41,933
Wait! Why are you running?

518
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:44,058
That thing went crazy!

519
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:46,500
I just hit the wrong button!

520
00:58:46,662 --> 00:58:49,660
- Well, why did you run?
- Me? I followed you!

521
00:58:51,172 --> 00:58:53,400
Anyway, this machine
isn't gonna be much help.

522
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,300
Really? No kidding!

523
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,800
I'm interested in seeing
what's behind that door.

524
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,600
Do you have a key?

525
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,700
- Let's just forget about this!
- No way!

526
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,000
Can't we just break the lock?
Just have a quick peek!

527
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,600
Come on, it's your house!

528
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,000
You should know what's up there!

529
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,300
- I'll get some tools!
- Hold on!

530
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,000
Damn it!

531
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,500
- Do you mind if I break the door?
- Great, break the door...

532
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:24,090
Hey, I need the light!

533
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,650
Take it easy, you'll wake up
my whole family!

534
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,570
If they didn't wake up before
they won't now either.

535
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,800
Come here.

536
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,500
Listen to this. November 16th:

537
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,500
My research into the origins
of the previous house owners

538
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,000
has not yielded any results,

539
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,500
but the manifestations I've
seen over the last few days

540
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,200
have me convinced beyond a doubt.

541
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,900
November 17th:

542
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,500
I know I'm not alone.

543
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,500
Something is here.
Something evil.

544
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,000
November 18th:
My visitors are on their way.

545
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:34,000
I can hear them coming.

546
01:03:51,366 --> 01:03:53,500
Wait, wait! Don't panic!

547
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:04,330
We have to get out of here!

548
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:06,600
Let's wake up the others and go!

549
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,500
No-no-no, stop!

550
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,500
What do you mean no-no-no?
This is my family and house!

551
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:15,520
- We don't even know what it is!
- I'm know and I'm leaving!

552
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,350
Calm down!
How will you explain this?

553
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:22,600
- Give me time to study it.
- What are you gonna do?

554
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,700
Go upstairs and say, I'm Allan!
Any demons hiding around here?

555
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,740
- We're not sure there are demons.
- I'm sure, very sure.

556
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,070
- What else could it be? I'm going!
- Wait! Wait!

557
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,070
There's one way to prove it.

558
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,500
If you help me, I can do it
very quickly! Come on!

559
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,000
Help with what?

560
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,100
What the hell are you up to now?

561
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,200
Help me with this.

562
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,800
- What is it?
- Grab it.

563
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,200
Grab it? What the hell is this thing?

564
01:04:54,246 --> 01:04:55,753
What's in the box?

565
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:00,054
You'll see, don't be so damn curious!

566
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,560
This here is a real machine.

567
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,000
It registers energy
just like the other ones.

568
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:13,000
But this one can also transmit high energy.

569
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,200
Close it.

570
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,300
- High energy?
- Yep, spirits and cold spots

571
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,500
are just collected energy

572
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,600
and if you give them a high voltage shock,

573
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,400
BZZZT! They disappear.

574
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,840
Get me the cable from the car.

575
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,500
- The cable?
- Yeah, we have to ground this thing too.

576
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,000
Hurry up.

577
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,400
Frank, this baby will take care of everything.

578
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:14,800
First, we activate the generator
and build up high voltage power.

579
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,400
That will stimulate any energy
fields you might have around here.

580
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:21,700
After that, we just wait for
something to appear.

581
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,125
Then I push this little button...

582
01:06:25,695 --> 01:06:28,695
and to hell with them.

583
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,900
Now, watch out.

584
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,700
That thing looks deadly.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

585
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,900
Hell yes, I've built it myself!

586
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,000
Something's happening.

587
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:31,000
What the hell!

588
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,000
Pull the plug!

589
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:00,730
You should have your head
examined, you lunatic!

590
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,650
The ground!
I forgot to ground the machine!

591
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,900
Come back here!

592
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,000
Allan!

593
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:21,500
Stop right now, damn it!

594
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,300
There's nothing to worry about.

595
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,000
Allan!

596
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,000
So...

597
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,100
it will say, in my report,

598
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,130
that ghosts took the life of Mr. Svensson.

599
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,000
Demons.

600
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,130
That's about all we can accomplish...

601
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:57,000
for now.

602
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:03,000
We'll be in touch as soon
as we get the autopsy report.

603
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:12,000
About Mr. Svensson's equipment...

604
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,500
It has been packed in his car.

605
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,500
His car is locked.

606
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:21,000
We'll come by for it.

607
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:24,650
It's been sealed and I expect
it to remain that way

608
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,900
until we can remove it.

609
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,000
Sara, listen...

610
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,900
Frank, this is the craziest
thing I've ever experienced.

611
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,040
I don't understand why you had to
drag that man here to begin with.

612
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,316
Shit.

613
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:55,300
Would you stop swearing?

614
01:11:55,426 --> 01:11:58,800
Alright, but I didn't drag him
here, he wanted to come.

615
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:01,950
Oh, is he the one who made
the first phone call?

616
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,000
Thanks to your absurd imagination he's dead.

617
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,300
Do you get it, Frank?
He's gone!

618
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,670
You're right on the edge here.

619
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:43,100
What was that about?

620
01:12:43,435 --> 01:12:44,925
You, of course.

621
01:12:45,025 --> 01:12:47,150
What did you both decide?
I should be committed?

622
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,250
Who knows, it might help.

623
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,300
Did you forget your appointment
with your clients this evening?

624
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,400
I have no intention of going.

625
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,800
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

626
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,800
Listen, Frank, don't make
this a test of wills.

627
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:03,500
What are you talking about?
You've already got me committed.

628
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,700
Sara, don't you get it?
We have to pack up and move.

629
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,000
- What are you saying?
- We have to go, Sara.

630
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,500
We have to pack up and
leave here immediately.

631
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,200
We'll be risking our lives
if we stay one more night.

632
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,400
Frank, we're not going anywhere,
you hear me?

633
01:13:17,588 --> 01:13:22,300
So go to that meeting and explain
to them that you need more time.

634
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:26,000
Forget it, you have no idea
what's going on.

635
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,400
Forget it, you say?
A man is dead, Frank!

636
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,500
We have no money and you're
chasing ghosts! It's almost comical!

637
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,700
Then why aren't you laughing?!

638
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,500
Christ, just stop this!
Why are you doing this to me?

639
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,660
I don't care about work, Sara!

640
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:43,000
And I sure as hell don't care about
this damn house! Understood?

641
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,500
The only this I want is for us to leave, now!

642
01:13:46,675 --> 01:13:48,330
Then I'm leaving, Frank.

643
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:50,500
I mean it, if you don't stop this...

644
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,200
it's over.

645
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:05,500
Peter? Lotta?

646
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,460
Sara, wait!

647
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,600
Wait!

648
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:17,000
You can't leave without us!

649
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,000
Stop the car, Sara!
You can't leave us here!

650
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,220
Yes I can!

651
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,460
Stop the car and act like an adult!

652
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,600
Get away from me!

653
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,500
Let go!

654
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,800
Stop it, Sara!

655
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,000
Stop the damn car, Sara!

656
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,300
Never!

657
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,500
Stop, Sara!

658
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:46,600
Let go, Frank!

659
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:15,000
Mom's just gone on an errand,
she'll be right back.

660
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,900
You two wait on the porch
while daddy calls a taxi.

661
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,300
Come with daddy.

662
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,500
Damn it!

663
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,100
Please, daddy, can we go inside?

664
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:11,000
Daddy will be there in a minute.

665
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:38,100
Why is daddy acting so crazy?

666
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:41,100
He's not crazy.
He's just mad at mommy.

667
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,800
They fight all the time because he's crazy.

668
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:01,500
How come you and mommy always fight?

669
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,770
We don't always fight, sweetheart.

670
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,000
Then why did she go away?

671
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,500
I don't know why.

672
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,200
Please, daddy...

673
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:17,000
will you read us a story?

674
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,700
Sure.

675
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,200
Yeah, a scary one!

676
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,300
Yeah, with a monster!

677
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:29,000
Come and sit down.

678
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:50,700
Yes, ma'am, you can dial
direct from your room.

679
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,000
Thanks.

680
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:00,000
Daddy?

681
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,000
Daddy, something bad...

682
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:22,100
We're sorry, the line is not working.
Please try your call later...

683
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,300
- Where's mommy?
- Now just calm down, honey.

684
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,200
- Mommy's coming soon.
- I want mommy.

685
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,800
Don't worry.
Daddy's here.

686
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,000
Stay calm.

687
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,300
Daddy?

688
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,500
Shit!

689
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,000
Crazy fool!

690
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:43,200
Damn it!

691
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,000
Don't be afraid.
Wait here for Daddy.

692
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,700
Peter!

693
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,600
Lotta! Check the wire!

694
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,700
Is it plugged in?

695
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,000
It came out!

696
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:15,085
Lotta!

697
01:30:15,185 --> 01:30:17,200
You have to plug it in!

698
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,200
Plug it in as fast as you can!

699
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,300
Lotta!

700
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,000
Plug it in!

701
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,000
Mommy!

702
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:07,000
Help us!

703
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,000
Frank!

704
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:44,000
Mommy, help!

705
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:56,400
- Open the door, Lotta!
- We can't, mommy!

706
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,000
It's blocked!

707
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,490
- Where's daddy?
- In the attic!

708
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,000
