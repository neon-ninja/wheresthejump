1
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,995
- Taylor!
- Tangina.

2
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:08,338
Over here!

3
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,574
I think we finally found the core.

4
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:16,134
We dug under the swimming pool.

5
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,882
This is directly below the old graveyard.

6
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,409
There's a presence.

7
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:05,152
There's something terrible.

8
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,169
Too much power.

9
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:23,141
I've seen it in dreams.

10
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,384
What is it?

11
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,702
Where's the family now?

12
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,022
- Did you make that?
- Wait a second.

13
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,502
- Inch and a half. I'll try this against her arm.
- It's too hot on the kids.

14
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:41,621
Okay.

15
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:42,963
Ready.

16
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:48,053
You'd be lucky
if your teeth don't fall out from that.

17
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,503
Did you think that sandwich up
all by yourself?

18
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:53,678
- No. Grandma helped.
- What a fib!

19
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:56,722
Grab me the red yarn out of my basket,
will you, honey?

20
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,556
- E. Buzz!
- That's disgusting.

21
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:01,550
Stop!

22
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,691
E. Buzz, down!

23
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,503
Maybe E. Buzz wants some mustard, Robbie.

24
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,577
E. Buzz, get down.

25
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:11,298
I'll say "down,"
and then he'll get down. Down!

26
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,106
He really listens to you.

27
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,961
Honey, now could you get me
the yellow yarn?

28
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:20,158
Rob, very nice to share with E. Buzz.

29
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,947
E. Buzz knows how to share with Robbie.

30
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,802
E. Buzz, get down.

31
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,031
Thank you, angel.

32
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:30,128
- Come on, Guerrero! Hit it out of the park!
- Yeah, hit it!

33
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,109
<i>... and has struck out...</i>

34
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,140
Dad, can't we get a TV like everybody else?

35
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:38,065
We can't get a TV.

36
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:41,259
Great, I'll just have to grow up retarded.

37
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:44,999
Come on, Rob, kids don't grow up retardo
because of lack of television.

38
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:51,454
No, Dad. I didn't see it.

39
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,812
You got to use your imagination, son.

40
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,664
Come on. Let's test this baby out.

41
00:08:58,307 --> 00:08:59,200
God!

42
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,107
How am I gonna sell this
to innocent housewives?

43
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,579
I don't know, Dad.

44
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,600
What are you drawing, honey?

45
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:36,004
Don't know. Stuff.

46
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,489
You draw very well.

47
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,240
Do you want to be an artist
when you grow up?

48
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:44,791
Maybe. Don't want to grow up much.

49
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,238
How come?

50
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,057
Probably not much fun.

51
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,373
Sure it is.

52
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:55,342
I've loved every age I've been.

53
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,812
They all have their blessings.

54
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,046
When I was your age...

55
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,943
I learned that I could do things
that other folks couldn't.

56
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,568
Like what kind of things?

57
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,816
I just knew things.

58
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:14,211
I didn't know how I knew, but I did.

59
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,291
Like what?

60
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,985
Once, my mother lost her bracelet...

61
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:23,452
and I knew where it was.

62
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:27,802
Two miles from our house,
in a place that I'd never been.

63
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:29,909
Now...

64
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,628
do you ever know things...

65
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:34,898
and can't explain why?

66
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,281
Yes?

67
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:43,912
Yes.

68
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,085
Darling...

69
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:51,493
that's a very special gift that you and I have.

70
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,343
It's nothing to be scared of.

71
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,647
Will it help me be a ballerina?

72
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:58,463
Sure it will.

73
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,890
Whatever you dream, you can be.

74
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,093
- They denied our claim again!
- What?

75
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:10,425
We shouldn't have told them
that the house vanished into thin air.

76
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:12,215
That's what I'm talking about.

77
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,906
They say that if the house disappeared,
then it's only missing.

78
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:18,923
Missing?

79
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,032
Do they think this house
is going to return, or something?

80
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,433
It's been a year.
The house is not coming back.

81
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:27,246
I got a gut feeling, Diane,
I'm positive about that.

82
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,489
I know that, Steven.

83
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,075
You tell them that...

84
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:33,514
No, I'm gonna fill out the fourth claim.

85
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:37,862
What are we going to claim this time?
Act of God? Housenapping?

86
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:41,284
We are almost broke.

87
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:44,030
Okay, we're broke, but we're not starving.

88
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,935
But I don't happen to like
having to live off my mother.

89
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,716
I think that we deserve a house of our own
again, someday.

90
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,438
Honey, gosh.

91
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,498
That's the difference between you and me.
I am into downward mobility.

92
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,088
I'm not settling for it. I'm into it.

93
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:02,515
I like getting out and meeting those...
I like selling vacuums.

94
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:06,353
I like carrying the pipes, the apparatus
and my little demo case.

95
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:09,678
Let's get the kids up,
and we'll paint the car different colors...

96
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:13,003
kind of Day-Glo, like we used to do
when we were kinda freaky.

97
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:15,587
The freaky Freelings on the road again!

98
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,145
You know, the family
whose house disappeared!

99
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,157
Watch them find it, Diane.

100
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:23,260
I'm not gonna get upset about this.
But I'm writing them back...

101
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,430
and when I sign that letter,
I'm signing, "Mr. President."

102
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,825
Steven, you are wacko!

103
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:39,733
You were never a hippie.

104
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,931
You were always into making money.

105
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:49,100
You only painted your van Day-Glo colors
and grew your hair long...

106
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,110
to impress Cookie Gurnich.

107
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:54,314
Cookie? Necki necka...

108
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:57,700
Don't tell me what Cookie can do.
I hated you then.

109
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,414
I always knew how to make up to you.
Didn't I?

110
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,104
- I don't remember.
- Sure you do.

111
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,995
- I do not.
- Come on.

112
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,579
I don't. You'd sing that stupid song.

113
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,440
Not in the shadow of Cookie.

114
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,049
Don't even try it. It's not working.

115
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,106
Don't sing that song.

116
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,308
I've never forgiven you for Cookie Gurnich.

117
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,127
It's...

118
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,962
Did Cookie really crumble?

119
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,406
Am I interrupting again?

120
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:06,996
Hi.

121
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:08,628
Hi, pumpkin.

122
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,160
Mom, I'm going to be a ballerina.

123
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:13,968
- Great.
- Not tonight, honey.

124
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,548
- Bedtime. Say goodnight, Mom.
- Goodnight, honey.

125
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:21,099
- Let's sleep in our own bed tonight.
- Okay.

126
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,930
Come on, Dodgers!

127
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,951
Come on, let's go.

128
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,519
Let's go, come on.

129
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:40,701
Robbie?

130
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:44,217
Mom, I've talked to the kittens.
They want to come home with us.

131
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,295
No, sweetheart, E. Buzz would get upset.

132
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,024
- Robbie, come on.
- Why?

133
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:51,158
He's not used to having
other pets around. Robert!

134
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,679
How would you like it
if I brought home a new baby?

135
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:55,824
That's even better than a kitten.

136
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:57,964
Mom, I have a great idea.

137
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,425
We are not buying a television set.

138
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,604
A present for Dad, it's a bargain.

139
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:12,929
Mom!

140
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,351
Mom, where are you?

141
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:30,386
Robbie!

142
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:42,826
Hi.

143
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:44,743
Hi.

144
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,046
Are you lost, sweetheart?

145
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,283
Are you afraid, honey?

146
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,699
Why don't you come with me?

147
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:54,977
No.

148
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,381
All right.

149
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,685
I'll sing you a song...

150
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,081
till your mommy comes back.

151
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,552
- I'd like to purchase this.
- That's $10.26 plus tax.

152
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,625
Where's Carol Anne?

153
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,546
- I don't know.
- She was just here.

154
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,583
Carol Anne?

155
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,977
Baby!

156
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:34,439
Honey, what happened?

157
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,710
- Did you get lost?
- I don't know.

158
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,067
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

159
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,946
Such a lovely child.

160
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,087
Thank you so much.

161
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:50,135
I'm sorry, honey.
We just stopped into a shop.

162
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,181
I thought you were right there with us.

163
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:00,369
Honey, what is it?

164
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:03,377
Mom, I want to go home.

165
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:06,732
- They're very unusual.
- They're just drawings.

166
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,321
Ugly.

167
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:12,325
She can see colors with her hands.

168
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,211
Mama, we don't want to hear
that stuff, okay?

169
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:17,570
And we don't want Carol Anne to hear.

170
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,967
There's nothing to be afraid of.

171
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,514
How do you know what we should be
afraid of? You weren't there.

172
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,083
Why don't you tell me?

173
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:26,944
- It might help.
- I did tell you.

174
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,530
- Not everything.
- I don't remember everything.

175
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,904
Try.

176
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:50,574
First the canary died.

177
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,260
And then the chairs went all funny...

178
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,140
and I thought it was kind of exciting.

179
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,661
And then...

180
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,125
Carol Anne was gone.

181
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:09,053
And I...

182
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:23,505
Honey, what is it?

183
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:25,872
Nothing.

184
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:33,294
I just want to get on with our lives. It's over.

185
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:34,920
Diane.

186
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:39,489
You've got to go unafraid into this life.

187
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:43,040
Don't instill fear into that child,
who is truly gifted...

188
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:46,078
- and filled with knowledge.
- I don't want her to be gifted!

189
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,312
- You don't mean that.
- I'm going to bed, goodnight.

190
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,094
I'll be there if you need me.

191
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,336
I'll be good.

192
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,069
I love you, too.

193
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,463
Goodnight, Grandma.

194
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,158
- She knew you loved her so much.
- Lf I just had one more day.

195
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,216
What's wrong?

196
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,517
Honey...

197
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:19,404
Grandma passed away last night.

198
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,198
Grandma died?

199
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,561
Come here, baby.

200
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,830
It's all right, Mom.

201
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,385
Mom.

202
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,348
You always made me feel so safe.

203
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:38,125
I love you so much.

204
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:46,788
Mom?

205
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:54,429
Can you put these on me,
so I can be a ballerina with wings?

206
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:59,617
Darling, you can be anything
you want to be.

207
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:12,047
Mama?

208
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:13,592
Hi. Grandma?

209
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,268
Do you have wings now?

210
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:21,547
My ballerina costume does.

211
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,875
Grammy?

212
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:27,917
Who are you?

213
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:31,969
I don't remember.

214
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,064
What?

215
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,205
Carol Anne, what's going on?

216
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,518
What are you doing?

217
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:07,723
Come on!

218
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:08,804
What is it?

219
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:14,850
Jesus! The kids.

220
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,695
- The kids!
- Kids!

221
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:19,590
Dad, Mom!

222
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:22,273
We're coming, Robbie!

223
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:35,706
Where are you?

224
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:00,998
They're back.

225
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,093
Don't panic!

226
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:21,389
Go, go!

227
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:32,872
- Who the hell are you?
- The name's Taylor.

228
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:35,810
Great. Good name. Come on, let's go.

229
00:27:41,544 --> 00:27:43,430
Tangina Barrons sent me.

230
00:27:44,773 --> 00:27:48,032
- Say hello to the magic munchkin.
- Steve, wait. Sent you for what?

231
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:49,912
There's no use running.

232
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:51,989
It'll find you.

233
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:54,140
You're better off here.

234
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,074
Let's go. You stay. We're gone.

235
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,955
Come on, kids.

236
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,827
You got me up at 4:00 in the morning
to tell me this?

237
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:28,738
You are a pack of trouble, girl.

238
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:31,003
Why are you messing around with that bum?

239
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:32,858
Because I like him.

240
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:36,317
Dad, are we going to have to move again?

241
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:40,337
I don't know.

242
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,117
- I'm going to think about it.
- Where can we go?

243
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,531
- Disneyland?
- Puke! Don't be such an infant!

244
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,025
Okay, what about Dunkin' Donuts?

245
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,744
Shut up, jerko.

246
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:54,505
Look. Here.

247
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,728
Go play the pinball machine.
Give some to your brother.

248
00:28:58,829 --> 00:28:59,722
No.

249
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:02,601
Come on, I wanna play pinball.
Give the money to me.

250
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:08,192
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know, I'm thinking.

251
00:29:09,157 --> 00:29:11,871
We have to go somewhere.
We can't just drive around.

252
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,481
Mother, just don't you bring him
over to my house.

253
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:17,429
Waitress, check!

254
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:28,941
Listen, children,
you can't run from this thing.

255
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:32,331
It has made contact and will stop at nothing.

256
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:34,320
You've got to fight it head on.

257
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:36,293
Stay together.

258
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:37,862
Be loving.

259
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:39,687
Be brave.

260
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,435
Mama?

261
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:53,247
- I'm not your mother, lady.
- Elspeth, are you okay?

262
00:29:53,314 --> 00:29:54,687
What happened?

263
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:56,949
You went funny.

264
00:30:00,957 --> 00:30:03,442
It sounded like her. I don't understand.

265
00:30:03,514 --> 00:30:05,553
Honey, you can't explain stuff like that.

266
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,144
It just happens.
I mean, there's no reason for it.

267
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,863
- What are you talking about?
- It doesn't matter, honey.

268
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:15,982
- What do you want?
- She told you the truth.

269
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:17,191
Who?

270
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,230
You mean, that...

271
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:23,398
Are you in cahoots with the lady in there?

272
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:25,538
I cahoot with no one.

273
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:27,844
Then why are you following us?

274
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,773
I came to help.

275
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:29,506
I came to help.

276
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:32,580
God, I mean, you don't understand.

277
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:34,170
We don't want your help.

278
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:37,557
We don't want anybody's help.
We want to be left alone!

279
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,400
Why did Tangina send you?
Why didn't she come herself?

280
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:44,850
It's my kind of job.

281
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:47,927
You know, maybe it's no coincidence.
This guy shows up...

282
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:50,674
things go kind of screwy. Get off my car!

283
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:58,062
Get in the car, Diane.

284
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:01,133
Get in the car, kids.

285
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:03,782
Wait a minute, let's listen to him.

286
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:06,436
Fine, you listen to him. I wanna go home.

287
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:08,196
Let's be sensible about this.

288
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:11,197
Sensible? What is sensible?
Honey, nobody can help us.

289
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:13,855
Let's just get in the car
and get the hell out of here!

290
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:15,898
And go where? It followed us here.

291
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:18,337
It'll follow us where we go.
We can't keep running.

292
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:19,578
Where are you from?

293
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:22,167
- From all over.
- This is Katrina.

294
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,054
Katrina?

295
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:26,354
- Hi, Katrina.
- What's that?

296
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,755
It's my medicine bag.

297
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:30,960
Charms.

298
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:32,973
See?

299
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:44,421
The house is okay? You're sure?

300
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,723
E. Buzz agrees. It's okay for now.

301
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:54,881
The dog agrees? That's terrific, isn't it?

302
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:56,538
Yes.

303
00:31:58,275 --> 00:31:59,484
Your car.

304
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,097
Very angry.

305
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:11,830
I'll fix it.

306
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,972
Make it happy?

307
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,982
Okay.

308
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:38,744
I've read about these rain dances. I know.

309
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,899
I understand that.

310
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,627
We don't need rain.

311
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:46,203
I can't say that Steven fully trusts him yet.
You can't blame him.

312
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,720
Okay. Thanks, Tangina. We will.

313
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,056
'Bye.

314
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:59,054
Honey, she says he's okay.
I think we should give him a chance.

315
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,009
- Tangina says he's okay?
- Yeah.

316
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,100
- That's great.
- Keep an open mind.

317
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:09,090
This is bizarre.

318
00:33:09,452 --> 00:33:12,133
I've got nothing against these people.

319
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,380
I got through most of the chapters.

320
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:19,233
I got some Indian in me, I think.

321
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,048
One-sixteenth, my mother
will never admit to it...

322
00:33:22,114 --> 00:33:24,697
but, honey, what if this guy...

323
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:27,931
is, like, an escapee from the tribal asylum?

324
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,189
Mom, come look at this!

325
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:38,802
My God!

326
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:44,843
I don't believe it!

327
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:14,067
What are you doing?

328
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:16,558
Hi, Mom. I'm going to help
protect the family now.

329
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:17,940
Let me see.

330
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,420
- Come outside, Robbie.
- I'm a big guy now.

331
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,595
I'm still your mother.
Wait for me in the house.

332
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:24,646
Thanks, Mom.

333
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,167
He wants to be a man.

334
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,928
There are a lot of ways to be a man.

335
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:32,843
I'm not sure wearing claw marks
and war paint is one of them.

336
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:34,438
How would you know?

337
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,047
What?

338
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:41,921
You're not a man, are you?

339
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,641
Okay, I'm not a man.

340
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,230
But you're not a mother!

341
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:50,872
It is my job to do everything I can
to make my children part of a normal world.

342
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,925
A world of school, and friends, and lovers,
and families of their own, someday.

343
00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:58,485
That's good.

344
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:01,834
Right, I know.

345
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:05,584
I hope that they'll learn
to forget all this soon.

346
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,404
They cannot learn by forgetting.

347
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:11,433
What would you have me do?
They're just children, for God's sake.

348
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:14,442
Children have fought wars.
They've built nations.

349
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,154
They are strong and have courage.

350
00:35:17,737 --> 00:35:20,451
Don't treat them any less than that
because they're young.

351
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:31,095
Taylor!

352
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,067
Okay, Taylor.

353
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:42,412
You can stay in the house.

354
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:44,873
You can have my aura, spirits,
the ghosts, everything.

355
00:35:44,948 --> 00:35:47,945
The whole cazaba,
but keep your hands off my car!

356
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:49,420
Okay? Hands off!

357
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:51,014
It's worse than it was before.

358
00:35:51,086 --> 00:35:53,060
- Car's still angry?
- Angry?

359
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:55,302
That car is pissed!

360
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:30,822
Come on, Carol Anne. It's raining!

361
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:33,003
Come on! What's wrong?

362
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:38,790
Let's go.

363
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,977
Honey, come inside!

364
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,110
You're getting soaked! Come on, sweetie.

365
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:07,467
Can we help you?

366
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,611
Haven't I've seen you somewhere before?

367
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:11,274
That is possible!

368
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:14,249
I get around. I love getting around.

369
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,740
Love talking to people...

370
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:18,950
even on a rainy day.

371
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,410
Dog's shedding.

372
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:30,877
Hi!

373
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,597
Hi.

374
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:34,362
I saw you at the shopping mall.

375
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:35,674
Sure you did...

376
00:37:35,742 --> 00:37:38,522
I remember your little angel, here.

377
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:41,400
Allow me to introduce myself.

378
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,901
Henry Kane.

379
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:45,517
Mom!

380
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:47,475
I got to tell you...

381
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:50,354
we've had enough
of door-to- door salesmen, if you don't mind.

382
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:51,847
Reverend Kane!

383
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,408
What I sell is free!

384
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,834
Mind if I come in and talk to you about it?

385
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:00,708
Mom, I don't feel well.

386
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:03,160
You know, I gotta...
Maybe we'll talk from here, all right?

387
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,933
You know, I gotta...
Maybe we'll talk from here, all right?

388
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:08,289
Come inside, baby. I want to take
your temperature. Come on, Robert.

389
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:22,774
I'm glad we have this opportunity to talk...

390
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:25,076
with your family out of the way.

391
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:29,201
Because I believe you have a problem here.

392
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:31,753
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,576
I believe...

394
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:37,127
there's an Indian living here with you?

395
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:40,005
Taylor.

396
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:44,253
So that's what he calls himself now.

397
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,351
You are in danger!

398
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:50,525
What do you mean?

399
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,441
I'm with an organization...

400
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:56,093
whose concern is families like your own...

401
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,522
families in crisis...

402
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:00,506
that are preyed upon...

403
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:04,021
by charlatans and fake magic
and false solutions!

404
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:06,962
I don't expect you to believe me now...

405
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,680
but let me come in
and talk to you about this.

406
00:39:10,964 --> 00:39:13,351
I don't know. This is crazy. This is nuts.

407
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:17,581
Please! Open your heart and your mind...

408
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,848
to what I'm saying.

409
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,500
He is dangerous!

410
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:53,586
I can see that he has a strong hold
on this family.

411
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,388
Who do your wife and children turn to...

412
00:39:58,192 --> 00:39:59,882
with their problems?

413
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:02,757
They turn to him.

414
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,928
Now, don't they?

415
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,684
They don't trust you...

416
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,017
anymore.

417
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:12,188
What you fear...

418
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:17,819
is that you're not man enough...

419
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,108
to hold this family...

420
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:23,606
together.

421
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:27,281
How do you know?

422
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,268
Because...

423
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:31,890
I'm smart.

424
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:36,685
And I'm your friend.

425
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,718
And I know...

426
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:43,785
what you are thinking.

427
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:47,712
How?

428
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:49,537
Now...

429
00:40:50,504 --> 00:40:51,779
let me in.

430
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:55,108
And let's talk about it.

431
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,981
Let me in!

432
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:04,181
You're my friend?

433
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:17,421
Now, before it's too late!

434
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,277
No.

435
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:26,153
You're gonna die in there! All of you!

436
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,671
You are gonna die!

437
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:31,517
Get the hell out of here!

438
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:38,905
Sorry to see...

439
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:42,101
you're still unconvinced.

440
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:53,008
A pleasure visiting with you.

441
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:30,298
You did good.

442
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:33,464
Who was that?

443
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,917
That was him.

444
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:41,218
Him?

445
00:42:44,297 --> 00:42:46,303
What are you talking about?

446
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:48,764
He was testing your power.

447
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:53,341
He comes in many forms, but that was him.

448
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,479
Now you're hooked.

449
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:01,521
You're on the path of a warrior.

450
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:03,220
Hooked? Wait.

451
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,264
What are you talking about?

452
00:43:05,337 --> 00:43:08,630
Your confrontation with him
was a drain on your power.

453
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:11,598
We don't have much time. We must prepare.

454
00:43:12,628 --> 00:43:13,804
Prepare?

455
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,737
Oh, God.

456
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:35,933
Tequila. Ta kill ya!

457
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:38,101
You want a hit?

458
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,175
No. I used to drink. I had to give it up.

459
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:43,673
Bad dreams.

460
00:43:47,673 --> 00:43:49,264
You see something?

461
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:51,308
No.

462
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:55,085
What are you doing?

463
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,899
Seeking power.

464
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:04,198
Me, too.

465
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:11,483
You feel like a leaf
at the mercy of the wind, don't you?

466
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:15,231
That's right. That's me.

467
00:44:16,546 --> 00:44:19,097
Since the day you were born,
one way or another...

468
00:44:19,168 --> 00:44:21,784
someone has been doing something to you.

469
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:26,551
I don't...

470
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:28,024
I don't think that's true.

471
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:31,382
They've been doing something to you
against your will.

472
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:33,518
And by now, you're feeling helpless...

473
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:35,594
like a leaf in the wind.

474
00:44:43,086 --> 00:44:47,174
Taylor, it would help me out a lot
if you'd just say what's on your mind...

475
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:49,216
so I could understand you.

476
00:44:49,865 --> 00:44:51,587
You understand me.

477
00:44:54,245 --> 00:44:57,559
No matter how much
you like to feel sorry for yourself...

478
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,511
you have to change that.

479
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:03,603
I'm a warrior.

480
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,207
A warrior would rather be defeated and die...

481
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:10,353
than act against his nature.

482
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,695
That is the path you've chosen to take...

483
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:18,154
whether you know it or not.

484
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:22,503
You should assume full responsibility.

485
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:26,347
Responsibility for what?

486
00:45:26,764 --> 00:45:28,901
Responsibility for everything...

487
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:31,070
everything in your world.

488
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:37,977
Come on, Robbie.

489
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:46,736
You're supposed to clean your braces
and come downstairs now.

490
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,949
Shut up, jerko! I'm doing it, okay?

491
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,544
Don't "okay" me!

492
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,200
You're a pest, you know that?

493
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:17,117
- Don't do that.
- I didn't do anything.

494
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,168
You're such an infant.

495
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:31,447
Ready? Where's Robbie?

496
00:46:31,578 --> 00:46:33,267
He says he's coming.

497
00:46:33,496 --> 00:46:34,444
Okay.

498
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:36,078
Kiss Katrina, too.

499
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,003
Goodnight, girls.

500
00:46:38,068 --> 00:46:39,474
Rob, come on!

501
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:42,090
Goodnight, Daddy.

502
00:46:43,504 --> 00:46:44,964
The telephone.

503
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:46,758
Hello?

504
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:48,163
Yes.

505
00:46:49,132 --> 00:46:51,650
Okay. Dad, it's for you.

506
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,307
Maybe it's the insurance company...

507
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:55,965
with good news.

508
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,891
Hello?

509
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:04,855
<i>Die!</i>

510
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:13,936
Mom!

511
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:16,172
God!

512
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,931
- Stay here, baby.
- Robbie!

513
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:22,158
We're coming, Robbie!

514
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:33,412
Dad, help me!

515
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:36,547
Taylor! Help us!

516
00:47:38,918 --> 00:47:40,062
Please!

517
00:47:42,786 --> 00:47:44,214
Help!

518
00:47:47,903 --> 00:47:49,592
Hold tight, Robbie!

519
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:52,693
The plug!

520
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,406
Get out!

521
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:18,015
Where the hell were you?

522
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:21,401
We're not safe here anymore,
my son almost dies, and you sit here!

523
00:48:21,477 --> 00:48:23,515
I was protecting Carol Anne.

524
00:48:23,587 --> 00:48:25,408
It's her he's after...

525
00:48:26,017 --> 00:48:28,470
not Robbie, not you or Diane.

526
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:32,729
Carol Anne.

527
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:38,327
Why the hell won't you leave us alone?

528
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:42,507
Dad!

529
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:38,368
He's still here.

530
00:49:40,392 --> 00:49:42,430
He feels she belongs to him.

531
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:43,870
But why?

532
00:49:44,229 --> 00:49:45,406
I'm not sure...

533
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,283
but he's used to getting what he wants.

534
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:50,172
Taylor...

535
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:52,763
who is he?

536
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:54,873
What is he?

537
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,208
He's a man filled with a demon...

538
00:49:57,274 --> 00:50:00,119
Iost in a dimension
that surrounds our world.

539
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:04,879
This entity believes
that his world and ours are the same.

540
00:50:05,876 --> 00:50:08,013
Why doesn't he know he's dead?

541
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:09,834
Because he isn't.

542
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:12,102
How can that be?

543
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:14,184
Nothing really dies.

544
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,822
Like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly...

545
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:22,628
death only transforms us
into another state of being.

546
00:50:24,294 --> 00:50:25,885
This man was evil.

547
00:50:27,011 --> 00:50:28,919
His soul remains evil...

548
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,994
because he chooses not to see the light...

549
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,745
and pass on to a different consciousness.

550
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,121
How are we going to fight this thing?

551
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:42,550
Until we learn how to defeat him...

552
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:45,299
we do not let him win.

553
00:50:45,397 --> 00:50:47,436
That's a hell of a plan. That's a lot of crap.

554
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:50,767
- I suppose you have a plan of your own.
- That's a lot of crap!

555
00:50:50,834 --> 00:50:53,199
Listen. Don't come apart now.

556
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:58,115
This spirit is very clever.

557
00:50:58,508 --> 00:51:00,645
He knows your strength is your love...

558
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:02,974
and he hates you for that.

559
00:51:03,752 --> 00:51:06,619
He's been trying to pull this family apart...

560
00:51:06,693 --> 00:51:08,731
and he will continue to try.

561
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:12,287
If he succeeds...

562
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:14,391
he will possess Carol Anne...

563
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:17,309
and destroy your spirit.

564
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:42,742
- Hi!
- Tangina!

565
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,081
- Hi!
- Tangina!

566
00:52:44,602 --> 00:52:45,878
Hi, Diane.

567
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:47,856
What are you doing here?

568
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:51,918
Sorry to come unannounced, sweetie,
but I need to speak with you.

569
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:53,394
I'm glad to see you.

570
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:56,043
Good, 'cause we're running out of time.

571
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:59,428
Below the old cemetery...

572
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,822
what seems to be a tomb
with many bodies in it...

573
00:53:03,563 --> 00:53:05,928
directly below your house.

574
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,390
Who are they?

575
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:11,582
The researchers don't know
who these people were.

576
00:53:12,037 --> 00:53:13,977
There are no marked graves.

577
00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:18,107
There are, however,
records of a religious sect...

578
00:53:18,176 --> 00:53:20,346
that mysteriously disappeared.

579
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,576
What happened?

580
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:25,943
Their spiritual leader was a medium...

581
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,262
who led his followers out to California
in the early 1800s...

582
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:32,365
to start a utopian society.

583
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:36,365
They disappeared near Cuesta Verde...

584
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:39,275
and were believed...

585
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:41,990
massacred by Indians.

586
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,098
This could be them.

587
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,375
This funny?

588
00:54:02,494 --> 00:54:04,249
I love the health club, you know.

589
00:54:04,317 --> 00:54:07,478
I'm just wondering
when I get the key to my locker.

590
00:54:08,953 --> 00:54:11,090
Sense of humor is good.

591
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,925
You're going to need it.

592
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:09,926
The entity has revealed
his essence to you, his enemy.

593
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,212
Now that you've seen each other...

594
00:55:14,726 --> 00:55:16,612
there'll be no mistakes.

595
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:18,682
Take this smoke.

596
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:28,597
Smoke...

597
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:32,431
make him one with power and knowledge.

598
00:55:34,295 --> 00:55:36,498
Here is a photo of those people.

599
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:40,011
I think you should have a look at it.

600
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:43,719
I know this is hard for you, dear...

601
00:55:43,951 --> 00:55:46,699
but I need your verification on something.

602
00:55:47,948 --> 00:55:48,896
You see...

603
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,150
I don't really trust my instincts anymore.

604
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,004
Now, hold this one...

605
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,040
and tell me what you feel.

606
00:56:07,294 --> 00:56:08,787
Oh, my God, I've seen him!

607
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,517
I thought so. Where?

608
00:56:11,162 --> 00:56:14,226
Here! At the mall! At our house!

609
00:56:14,424 --> 00:56:15,569
Who is he?

610
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,842
Just tell me what you feel.

611
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,763
What do you want me to do? Who is he?

612
00:56:19,828 --> 00:56:22,412
I've consulted others.
They've told me things...

613
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:24,074
but they said you know more!

614
00:56:24,144 --> 00:56:25,550
I don't know anything!

615
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,956
You do!

616
00:56:27,534 --> 00:56:31,786
You traveled to a dimension
few people have ever traveled, to incarnate!

617
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,786
Your daughter is highly clairvoyant!

618
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,537
As was your mother, I suspect.

619
00:56:38,054 --> 00:56:39,875
As you are as well!

620
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:42,752
Now tell me what you feel!

621
00:56:48,382 --> 00:56:50,420
It is him. It's the preacher.

622
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:55,096
They're following him in death,
like they did in life.

623
00:57:11,372 --> 00:57:14,752
Don't! No, please! Please don't!

624
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:28,023
It all makes sense now.

625
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,026
When you brought Carol Anne
back to this world...

626
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:35,158
his followers became restless...

627
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,222
because they had tasted
the light of her being...

628
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:40,082
her life force.

629
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,472
Now he wants her back.

630
00:57:44,946 --> 00:57:48,010
This person is no longer human.

631
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:52,482
He is the beast.

632
00:58:02,022 --> 00:58:04,802
You must take your family back
to Cuesta Verde.

633
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:07,896
What?

634
00:58:09,088 --> 00:58:11,606
The evil spirit that is stalking you...

635
00:58:11,677 --> 00:58:13,367
it knows who you are...

636
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:15,889
where you are, how to find you...

637
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,798
what your weaknesses are.

638
00:58:18,872 --> 00:58:20,758
Your best bet is to confront him...

639
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:23,057
surprise him on his own ground.

640
00:58:24,564 --> 00:58:27,376
But what about Diane and the kids?

641
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:29,453
They are your power...

642
00:58:30,575 --> 00:58:32,232
and you are theirs.

643
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:53,782
Are things desperate?

644
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,713
What you see as desperate,
I see as inevitable.

645
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:02,226
I've done all I can.

646
00:59:03,382 --> 00:59:05,322
I must be leaving you now.

647
00:59:09,073 --> 00:59:10,217
I'll take you home.

648
00:59:15,788 --> 00:59:17,510
Taylor's not here. That's all right.

649
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:21,405
We'll keep on going
just like we've been doing, as a family.

650
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:26,048
Son, you know, I've told you
about the helmet and eating...

651
00:59:26,148 --> 00:59:28,154
I told you, I'm not hungry.

652
00:59:28,707 --> 00:59:30,200
Miniature golf.

653
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:32,920
Tomorrow we can play some miniature golf!

654
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,899
We can get our putters...

655
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,335
How about bowling?

656
00:59:37,499 --> 00:59:39,537
You like bowling, sweet pea.

657
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:42,064
Nature hike, Rob.

658
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,467
Brisk walk?

659
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:47,566
I know. The water slide.

660
00:59:47,636 --> 00:59:50,950
We'll take E. Buzz, we'll put water wings
on him, and shove him down...

661
00:59:51,024 --> 00:59:52,714
and laugh, won't we?

662
01:00:37,197 --> 01:00:39,400
So, after Alice fell down the hole...

663
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:41,288
why'd she drink from that bottle?

664
01:00:41,354 --> 01:00:43,425
Because it said, "Drink me" on it.

665
01:00:44,424 --> 01:00:46,495
Were they going to capture her?

666
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:48,386
Take her someplace bad?

667
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:51,681
Yes, but Alice gets home
all right, remember?

668
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:55,482
Did she know why they wanted to hurt her?

669
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:57,853
I don't think so, honey.

670
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,688
'Cause I know.

671
01:01:01,275 --> 01:01:02,703
You know what?

672
01:01:02,873 --> 01:01:04,432
Why they're here.

673
01:01:06,614 --> 01:01:09,427
Why, baby? Why are they here?

674
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:12,362
'Cause they don't know where else to go.

675
01:01:47,223 --> 01:01:48,270
God!

676
01:01:54,066 --> 01:01:55,079
God!

677
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:18,964
<i>God is in His holy temple</i>

678
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:24,058
<i>God is in His holy temple</i>

679
01:02:56,003 --> 01:02:57,278
Hi, angel!

680
01:03:05,818 --> 01:03:07,410
Are you okay, Dad?

681
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,557
Yeah.

682
01:03:09,112 --> 01:03:11,827
I just want to give my little girl a hug.

683
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:18,664
Your mom and I would like to talk alone.

684
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:22,313
Go put on your nightie, honey.

685
01:03:26,155 --> 01:03:28,008
What's going on, Steve?

686
01:03:31,472 --> 01:03:33,380
Nothing. I just want us to be alone.

687
01:03:33,454 --> 01:03:35,111
Carol Anne's upset.

688
01:03:37,452 --> 01:03:38,628
Does that feel good?

689
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:40,355
I should dry her hair.

690
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:42,431
She's all right. She's safe.

691
01:03:42,503 --> 01:03:44,028
Come on!

692
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:47,871
- Honey!
- Is that good?

693
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:50,619
Don't! Not now!

694
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:51,964
Why? When?

695
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,559
What do you mean?

696
01:03:53,631 --> 01:03:55,538
I have needs, too!

697
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:59,319
It seems to me your needs
have been fulfilled by the bottle tonight!

698
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:10,925
Don't.

699
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,187
Are you accusing me of being drunk?

700
01:04:14,255 --> 01:04:16,163
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- You are.

701
01:04:16,237 --> 01:04:18,308
- That's what you're thinking.
- I'm not!

702
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,963
I know you! That's what you're thinking!

703
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:23,777
Spare me.

704
01:04:23,848 --> 01:04:27,325
You remember, just the other day...

705
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,207
when you were seven...

706
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:33,851
and you were helping your mommy
plant flowers in the garden?

707
01:04:35,774 --> 01:04:37,431
You saw it clearly.

708
01:04:37,756 --> 01:04:39,511
How the hell do you know that?

709
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,814
'Cause I am smart.

710
01:04:42,873 --> 01:04:45,554
Mommy Jess... Don't cry.

711
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:47,726
- Shut up.
- Don't pout!

712
01:04:47,797 --> 01:04:50,031
You think that all of our troubles...

713
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,007
are because of Carol Anne!

714
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:56,452
You wish Carol Anne
had never been given birth to!

715
01:04:59,724 --> 01:05:03,266
You never wanted Carol Anne!

716
01:05:04,807 --> 01:05:06,813
But you thought it!

717
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:09,306
You thought it, baby!

718
01:05:09,795 --> 01:05:11,517
You thought about it!

719
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:15,326
You thought that? You thought it!

720
01:05:22,394 --> 01:05:25,261
- Diane's had secrets!
- Don't!

721
01:05:25,336 --> 01:05:27,440
Don't touch me!

722
01:05:29,013 --> 01:05:31,597
I know you! I feel you!

723
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:35,941
What is wrong with you?
What is happening to you?

724
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,869
Why are you doing this?

725
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:40,385
What is happening to you?

726
01:05:41,644 --> 01:05:43,169
Steven, stop it!

727
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:46,302
Stop it!

728
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,935
We want the angel!

729
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:49,888
The sweet pea!

730
01:05:54,626 --> 01:05:55,966
Stop it!

731
01:05:58,366 --> 01:06:00,753
I love you! Damn you!

732
01:06:01,244 --> 01:06:04,470
He is in his holy temple!

733
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,857
Don't you know that?

734
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:10,576
I love you! Believe me, I love you!

735
01:06:15,825 --> 01:06:17,646
God, leave me alone!

736
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:19,818
What is it?

737
01:06:20,557 --> 01:06:22,443
What's happening to you?

738
01:06:25,002 --> 01:06:27,782
- What's going on?
- Leave me alone.

739
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:31,931
What is it? What's the matter?

740
01:06:32,004 --> 01:06:33,181
God!

741
01:06:34,403 --> 01:06:37,019
God, what is it? What's the matter?

742
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:49,776
Oh, God!

743
01:07:07,465 --> 01:07:08,609
Honey!

744
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:18,649
Wake up!

745
01:08:20,465 --> 01:08:22,122
Kids, where are you?

746
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:24,653
Stay put! We'll find you!

747
01:08:36,772 --> 01:08:37,916
Babies?

748
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:54,018
Oh, God!

749
01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:21,454
I'll check in here. All right?

750
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,156
Babies, please answer me!

751
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,135
Are you in here?

752
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:50,268
Kids, please come!

753
01:10:59,765 --> 01:11:00,779
Kids?

754
01:11:15,913 --> 01:11:17,058
Robbie!

755
01:11:19,495 --> 01:11:21,152
Carol Anne! Please!

756
01:11:24,578 --> 01:11:25,592
Mom!

757
01:11:27,744 --> 01:11:29,652
Baby, are you all right?

758
01:11:31,389 --> 01:11:32,501
Diane?

759
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:36,627
- Where's Carol Anne?
- We can't find her. I don't know.

760
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:38,005
The garage!

761
01:11:40,118 --> 01:11:42,702
- Carol Anne!
- Where are you?

762
01:11:49,998 --> 01:11:52,069
Where are you? Honey?

763
01:11:55,275 --> 01:11:57,096
Open the door, sweet pea!

764
01:11:57,162 --> 01:11:58,753
Come on, honey, open the door!

765
01:11:58,824 --> 01:12:00,481
Lift up the knob, sweetheart.

766
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,621
- Come on, honey, open the...
- What is it?

767
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:06,236
Sweetheart, that wasn't Daddy
in the bathroom. You know that.

768
01:12:06,306 --> 01:12:07,734
Oh, baby!

769
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:09,465
Grab it!

770
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,542
Mom!

771
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:16,785
Dad, watch out!

772
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,884
Okay, Diane, get in the car!

773
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:22,411
Go, baby, go!

774
01:12:22,486 --> 01:12:23,892
Open the door, Carol Anne.

775
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:31,269
- Steven, come on!
- Daddy, hurry!

776
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:32,934
Hurry!

777
01:12:33,454 --> 01:12:34,435
Go!

778
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:38,527
Get us out! Go!

779
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:40,007
Dad, E. Buzz!

780
01:12:40,936 --> 01:12:42,495
E. Buzz, get in!

781
01:12:43,814 --> 01:12:45,951
Come on, E. Buzz, now get in!
Be a good boy!

782
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,189
Come on, E. Buzz, get in.

783
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:53,947
- Come on, Robbie!
- Close the door!

784
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:57,107
Dad, let's get out of here!

785
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:01,554
- Come on, move!
- Go.

786
01:13:01,975 --> 01:13:03,535
- It won't move!
- Go!

787
01:13:03,606 --> 01:13:04,980
It won't start!

788
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:11,917
Go! Please!

789
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:23,425
Look out!

790
01:13:32,384 --> 01:13:34,074
Move, damn it!

791
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:42,449
Get going, Steven!

792
01:13:43,735 --> 01:13:44,847
Hurry!

793
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,728
- Drive the car!
- Now, move!

794
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:14,677
Jesus!

795
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:43,208
We're going back
to Cuesta Verde, aren't we?

796
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,470
That's right.

797
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:49,124
But what about the kids?

798
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:55,258
Taylor said we go back as a family.
We go back together. That's all of us.

799
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:58,387
Do you believe him, Dad?

800
01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:07,190
Honey, it was real smart of you
to hide in the car like that.

801
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:08,844
It wasn't my idea.

802
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:11,534
Taylor said it was the only safe place.

803
01:15:11,603 --> 01:15:13,489
Dad, do you believe him?

804
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:20,996
I do believe him, son.

805
01:16:29,879 --> 01:16:31,536
Tangina. Thank God.

806
01:16:31,606 --> 01:16:35,313
I knew you'd be here,
so I had to be here, too.

807
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,612
We had to come.

808
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,857
I know.

809
01:16:39,024 --> 01:16:42,251
But there are many dangers
you must consider, Steven.

810
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,711
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.

811
01:17:01,374 --> 01:17:02,802
Careful, honey.

812
01:17:03,676 --> 01:17:04,690
Mom!

813
01:17:05,563 --> 01:17:08,692
Honey, if you don't want
to go through with this...

814
01:17:08,761 --> 01:17:11,126
we can leave here right now, okay?

815
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,058
I do want to go on.

816
01:17:15,092 --> 01:17:16,683
I love you more than anything.

817
01:17:17,139 --> 01:17:19,341
You always remember that, okay?

818
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:53,973
God, they're all...

819
01:17:55,349 --> 01:17:58,030
They're all dying here! Oh, God!

820
01:18:01,232 --> 01:18:04,578
They're all reaching out for help
that will never come.

821
01:18:08,299 --> 01:18:09,313
All because they worship him.

822
01:18:18,979 --> 01:18:20,090
Diane!

823
01:18:21,026 --> 01:18:22,334
Carol Anne!

824
01:18:35,926 --> 01:18:38,128
They are gone! They have crossed over!

825
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:41,510
Now we have to get them back,
and you know how. Please!

826
01:18:43,216 --> 01:18:44,360
Taylor!

827
01:18:48,428 --> 01:18:49,442
Dad!

828
01:19:02,497 --> 01:19:04,154
Taylor, where are they?

829
01:19:04,224 --> 01:19:05,499
I see her!

830
01:19:07,134 --> 01:19:08,791
This is the way in.

831
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,034
The entity is with them.

832
01:19:11,099 --> 01:19:12,985
They're in grave danger.

833
01:19:13,145 --> 01:19:14,932
Hold on to each other.

834
01:19:15,608 --> 01:19:18,061
When you find Diane and Carol Anne...

835
01:19:18,997 --> 01:19:20,240
band together.

836
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:24,325
That will prevent you
from crossing over into eternity.

837
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:27,018
I'll try to bring you all back.

838
01:19:27,086 --> 01:19:28,329
Join together.

839
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,981
The light of the family can defeat him.

840
01:19:31,563 --> 01:19:35,139
This is the moment
you've been moving towards, all your life.

841
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,405
The entrance is through the flames.

842
01:19:42,434 --> 01:19:45,596
Daddy, help!

843
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:50,936
This is an illusion! The beast lies!

844
01:19:51,228 --> 01:19:53,233
Go through the flames, now!

845
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:21,587
She's gone.

846
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:24,936
It's too late.

847
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:29,357
I've lost.

848
01:22:18,538 --> 01:22:19,813
Thank God!

849
01:22:37,627 --> 01:22:38,968
Some battle.

850
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,650
Your car.

851
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:06,462
It's happy.

852
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,117
Not yet.

853
01:23:10,146 --> 01:23:12,446
How are we going to make it happy?

854
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,705
It wants to come home with me.

855
01:23:16,957 --> 01:23:18,646
- You asked it?
- Yes.

856
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:21,750
It's sure?

857
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:28,842
Okay, it's yours. Take it.

858
01:23:40,747 --> 01:23:42,152
We thank you.

859
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,529
It started right up.

860
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:50,434
'Bye, Taylor!

861
01:23:50,499 --> 01:23:52,570
- Dad, you gave our car away?
- Yes.

862
01:23:52,642 --> 01:23:55,323
Steven, we have no... We need a ride home.

863
01:23:59,357 --> 01:24:01,243
My car needs me!

864
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:05,650
Wait for us!

865
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,246
My car likes me!
