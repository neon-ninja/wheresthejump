2
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,248
It was my father's
religious beliefs

3
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,288
that destroyed
our family.

4
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,875
We have to be so very
careful what we believe in.

5
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,248
Hello.

6
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,288
There's a... there's a little
lad coming through to me now.

7
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,250
Come on, come on.

8
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:19,705
He wants to talk
to someone.

9
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:22,705
Oh, he's a little...
he's a little lad

10
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:25,830
and he... and he's
lookin' for his mom.

11
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,538
He's sayin' his name
is... is Rob or Robbie.

12
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,373
Is that... Is that you,
sweetheart?

13
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,455
Stand up, my love.

14
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:37,498
Mark Van Rhys is one of the
UK's most popular psychics.

15
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,913
He believes that we're making a
documentary about his special powers

16
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:45,123
whereas, in fact, we are investigating
the many, many complaints

17
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,330
that have been made
against him.

18
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:48,330
Do what this lady has done

19
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:51,373
and accept the message.

20
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,163
Mark?
Mark, can you hear me?

21
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:55,705
Oh, just give us a sign.

22
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:57,873
Scratch your nose
for a sec, see.

23
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,373
Oh, thank God for that.

24
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,038
It's Steph, right?
The woman's name's Steph.

25
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,455
He calls you mom, but
he's... he's telling me

26
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,205
your name is Steph?

27
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,580
Oh, my God.

28
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:08,748
Is... Is that right,
my love?

29
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,498
- Are you Steph?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,955
Okay,
so before the show starts

31
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,788
Van Rhys' team
have audience members

32
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,122
fill out one of these
prayer cards.

33
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,413
There are the name
and details

34
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:19,956
of the person
they wish to contact

35
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,788
who has passed over
to the other side.

36
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,623
The team then steal
this information

37
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,456
and they feed it back
to Van Rhys

38
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,373
through a hidden earpiece,
which I just hacked into

39
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,831
and, hey, presto,
he's psychic.

40
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,123
My blood hurts, mommy.

41
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,083
My blood hurts.

42
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,788
Why is he saying that?

43
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,663
He had leukemia.

44
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,081
Poor little lamb.

45
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,663
Oh, he's got a cheeky
little smile, hasn't he?

46
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,498
Yes.

47
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,413
Children often make
the best connection

48
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:57,373
because they're so pure,
you see.

49
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,413
He was such a good boy.

50
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:01,663
He still is, my sweet,
he still is.

51
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,373
He says he's happy

52
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,373
but he does miss
your cooking.

53
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,248
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am sorry to interrupt.

54
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,456
My name is
Professor Philip Goodman

55
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,456
from the TV program
"Psychic Cheats."

56
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,081
Mr. Van Rhys,
we have got..

57
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,873
Mr. Van Rhys,
we have got proof

58
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,498
that you are being fed information
through a hidden earpiece

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,998
and you are passing it off
as contact with the dead...

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,413
- Excuse me, sir.
- I beg your pardon.

61
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,206
This is gonna be broadcast
on national television.

62
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,163
Can you deny that you
were using an earpiece?

63
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:26,456
That's slander.

64
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,538
I can assure you,
you will be hearing

65
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,998
from my solicitor
in due course.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,373
His assistant just
told him that Robbie

67
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,456
was in
Christchurch Hospital.

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,748
I can play you the tape.

69
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,331
I'm sorry.
Christchurch Hospital!

70
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,373
He's lyin', isn't he?

71
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,623
The idea of us
and our loved ones dying

72
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,248
just ceasing to exist
is so awful

73
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,581
that we'll believe
anything which gives us hope

74
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,456
that there might be
something beyond.

75
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,663
That fear is known
as existential terror

76
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:01,540
and the man who coined that phrase was Dr.
Charles Cameron.

77
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,038
So why do you think

78
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,913
the voices
come through you, Jean?

79
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,457
'Cause we love her.

80
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,623
And how many voices
are there?

81
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,540
300.

82
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,206
I moved back in.
I thought it would help.

83
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,748
She's only here 'cause
she ran out of booze.

84
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,748
Mom.

85
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,498
She fingered herself
last night

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,748
thinkin'
about John Travolta.

87
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,373
Daddy sees everything.

88
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,373
Jesus!

89
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,081
I've seen this before.

90
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,748
Your mother
feels abandoned

91
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,748
at the death
of your father.

92
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,998
Is she possessed?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,663
No, she's angry that
her husband had died.

94
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:48,998
As for the vase..

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,706
...I did that.

96
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,413
The brain sees
what it wants to see.

97
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,663
When I saw that clip
when I was a boy

98
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:02,331
it was like
a lightning bolt struck me

99
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,206
'cause it was like
somebody saying

100
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,663
you don't have to have your life
ruled by superstitious fear.

101
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:10,373
And the way that I'd been
brought up, that was..

102
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,663
Honestly, that was a revelation
'cause I didn't realize

103
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,706
there was a different way
of thinking.

104
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,913
And, uh, from that minute

105
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:20,163
I... I can remember thinking
that's what I wanna do

106
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:23,038
that's what I wanna be,
that's who I want to be.

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,663
The search
for the missing scientist

108
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:27,788
and paranormalist, Charles
Cameron, has been called off

109
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,623
three weeks after Mr. Cameron's
car was found abandoned

110
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,456
near his house in Filey.

111
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,663
I think it's ironic
to say the least

112
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:36,163
that a man
who spent a lifetime

113
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,331
explaining away mysteries
became one himself.

114
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,875
I just wish I could
have met him is all.

115
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,248
Hello, Professor Goodman.

116
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,916
This is Charles Cameron.

117
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,041
I'm sure you're surprised
to hear my voice.

118
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:16,330
I'm familiar with your work
and I need to see you.

119
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,664
I don't have long.

120
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:23,039
Please come
to 79 East Shore

121
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,705
Caravan Park..

122
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,789
Hi, Mr. Cameron.
I'm Philip Goodman.

123
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,123
Hello,
I'm Philip Goodman.

124
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,289
Come on.

125
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,748
Hello, Mr. Cameron,
I'm Philip Goodman.

126
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,955
Hello, Charles.

127
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,790
Hello,
I'm Philip Goodman.

128
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,580
Hold on.

129
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,498
Come in.

130
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,457
I'm not paying
to heat the street.

131
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:47,789
Oh, Jesus.

132
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,705
Come in, sit down.
Sit down, please.

133
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,123
Hello,
I'm Philip Goodman.

134
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,125
I know who you are.

135
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:58,498
I can't quite
believe this.

136
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,205
No? Why is that?

137
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,873
I think like everybody
else, I just pre..

138
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,455
...sort of presumed
you were dead.

139
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,790
How do you know I'm not?

140
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,164
Can I ask what,
where you've been?

141
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,705
- What's happened?
- Pour me a drink then.

142
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:23,748
Pour it
from that bottle there.

143
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,455
Bottle there. Pour it!

144
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:26,790
Okay.

145
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,958
I brought you something.

146
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,833
It's a copy
of my latest book.

147
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,750
- I signed it...
- Aah.

148
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,833
Just stick it there.

149
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:56,748
I'm so familiar
with your books

150
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,955
and your, your TV work.

151
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:01,830
I've always felt
a closeness to you.

152
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:06,580
Save those sentiments
for your wife and family.

153
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:09,707
What a surprise.
You're not married.

154
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,830
You could always see
the truth, couldn't you?

155
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,080
Truth?

156
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,873
I look back now at my work

157
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,873
with absolute shame.

158
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,955
I see the arrogance
and the disrespect

159
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,998
with which I went
into those homes.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,623
I took pleasure
in pulling those stories

161
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,914
those people apart.

162
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,414
I think you're being
really hard on yourself.

163
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,580
I have seen your work,
Goodman.

164
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:37,915
You want to know
what I think of it?

165
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,955
It's shit.

166
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:46,998
You are a conceited,
weak-willed coward.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,330
Editing out
any inconvenient data.

168
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,955
Terrified of anything
that doesn't fit

169
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:51,664
into your tiny
worldview...

170
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,873
Okay, I'm done. I came here
in good faith because you...

171
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,039
Three cases!

172
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,498
I couldn't explain
three cases

173
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,330
that haunt me still.

174
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,373
Now you go and
investigate if you dare

175
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,705
and come back and tell me
that I am wrong

176
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:06,039
because I've come to one
inescapable conclusion

177
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,873
and that is
the supernatural

178
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,789
the unseen forces
that surround us

179
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,580
everything that you and I
have spent a lifetime

180
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,875
trying to debunk and
disprove, it's all true.

181
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,832
Every last bit of it.

182
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:24,914
Please, Mr. Goodman

183
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,830
I'm begging you.

184
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:29,165
Tell me I am wrong.

185
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,500
I need you to tell me..

186
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:35,915
...I'm wrong.

187
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:46,665
Oh, hello, Tony?

188
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,039
Aye, captain.

189
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,998
Hello there.

190
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,123
Hi, I'm Philip Goodman.

191
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,789
Bang! Whoa! Slow.

192
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,166
Too slow.

193
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,955
Yeah, you look
like a teacher.

194
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,498
Do I? Right.

195
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,623
Um, well, technically,
I'm a professor.

196
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,164
They bloody insist
on calling me that

197
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,083
on that TV show that I do,
"Psychic Cheats."

198
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,580
Oh, yeah, that's where
I know you from.

199
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:17,205
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I seen that.

200
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,582
Yeah, it's shit.

201
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,123
I'm only joking
with you, mate.

202
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,705
I ain't seen it.

203
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,875
I have never even
heard of it, sunbeam.

204
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,248
- Professor, eh?
- Yeah.

205
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,955
You know,
that's the official title

206
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,330
for someone who does
a "Punch And Judy."

207
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,248
I bet you didn't know
that, did you?

208
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,123
- No, I didn't actually.
- There you go then.

209
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,039
The professor
just learned something

210
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,080
from the humble
night watchman.

211
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:43,414
And that's what you do,
is it?

212
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:47,707
You're a night watchman?

213
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:52,123
Actually, I don't wanna
talk about it, mate.

214
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,330
Sorry?

215
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:55,290
I'm just not feeling
very chatty, sunbeam.

216
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,250
For fuck's sake.

217
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,247
Oh, did I forget to mention
that there was a fee?

218
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:13,163
- 100 quid.
- 50.

219
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,165
Done.

220
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:23,083
20, 25..

221
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,166
50.

222
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,163
So that's what
you do, yeah?

223
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:37,873
You're a night watchman?

224
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,081
Well, I was, you know,
when, um, it happened.

225
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,291
- And now?
- Now?

226
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,331
Let's just say
that immigration

227
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,250
has made things
a bit tough, yeah?

228
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,125
How about family?
You married?

229
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,248
I was married
for 15 years.

230
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,248
You get less for murder,
don't you?

231
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,206
Did you divorce?

232
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,583
She died 23 years ago.

233
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,706
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,581
If she fell ill now,
they'd smash that cancer.

235
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,038
Different world, isn't it?

236
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,038
Yeah. Any children?

237
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,207
Mind your own
fucking business.

238
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,538
How many more of these questions
have you got, eh, Kojak?

239
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,500
It's worse than getting
car insurance, this.

240
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,083
I got a daughter, Marnie.

241
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,873
I was always
a big Hitchcock fan.

242
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,788
If I had had a boy,
I would've called him Norman.

243
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,498
- How old is she?
- She's 30.

244
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,373
Right, so she was seven
when your wife died.

245
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,165
That must have been tough.

246
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,913
Marnie is not my wife's.

247
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:14,373
I had a little bit
on the side.

248
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,915
What are you gonna do, eh?

249
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,956
Right.
You see much of her?

250
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,373
Well, I'm done here.
This is bullshit.

251
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,581
I thought you wanted to
talk about what I'd seen.

252
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,375
Tony, I'm just
trying to help.

253
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,500
You can't help me, mate.

254
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,541
She's in hospital.

255
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,748
She's been in there
five years.

256
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,081
Oh, fuck.

257
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,208
Locked-in syndrome
they call it.

258
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:56,456
Her eyes are open, but..

259
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,250
...everything else
is paralyzed.

260
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,081
If I go and see her,
I... I don't know

261
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,041
if she even knows
if I'm there or not.

262
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,832
I stopped going
in the end.

263
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,208
I couldn't handle it.

264
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,750
My little girl.

265
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,123
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,915
You apologize a lot,
don't you?

267
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:27,000
Guilty conscience?

268
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,082
You wanna..

269
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,458
Wanna tell me
about your incident?

270
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,831
You'll think I'm mad.

271
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,250
Everyone else does.
Even my priest.

272
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,833
Ah, you don't believe,
do you?

273
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,875
It was my last night
working that job.

274
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,538
Quarter to 4:00
in the morning.

275
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,500
That is a shit time
of night.

276
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,413
Even after seven years
of doin' that shift

277
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:09,500
your body never
gets used to it.

278
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,248
That place had a history.

279
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,208
None of it was nice.

280
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,331
Hundreds of years before,
it was, um, it was a..

281
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,041
What do you call it?
A nuthouse for women.

282
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,123
Mad birds roaming
about the place.

283
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,456
Old brasses, drunks

284
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,998
young girls that got
themselves knocked up

285
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,333
newborns that no one
wanted, thrown away.

286
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:36,832
Miserable.

287
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,163
In the month
leadin' up to that night

288
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:43,663
two of the new
foreign blokes quit.

289
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:45,625
They said
they had seen things.

290
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,875
Did you believe them?

291
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,000
I wish I had.
Christ Almighty.

292
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,665
Hello? Marek?

293
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,500
You have to press
the button on the side.

294
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:51,708
Press the big black button on
the side, you Russian prick.

295
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:57,163
Yo, Tony.
I am in other building.

296
00:22:57,165 --> 00:23:00,332
Congratulations.
Which other building?

297
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:05,081
Um, the building
with the blue door.

298
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,288
Alright. You're in
building number three.

299
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,538
Yes, yes, yes.
What do I do?

300
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,582
Well, you sit on your arse
for the next 10 hours.

301
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,788
Every hour
go for a walk round

302
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,663
and then chart it.

303
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,538
Set that timer
that I gave ya.

304
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,663
Other than that,
you do what you want.

305
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:29,165
I don't know, read,
play chess, learn English.

306
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,248
Okay.
Thank you a lot, Tony.

307
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,040
Alright, Marek.
No worries.

308
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,038
And then she sat down
with a cup of tea

309
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,873
and just went mad.

310
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,456
"That's typical of you,"
she said.

311
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,913
"Lord Muck, always
thinkin' of himself.

312
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,498
"Didn't even cross his mind
to ask if I wanted one, so.."

313
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,663
I'm havin'
a cup of tea, mate.

314
00:23:59,665 --> 00:24:00,956
What do you reckon?

315
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:04,538
Was I selfish?
Is that what marriage is?

316
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,081
A lifetime sentence
of making

317
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,498
two cups of tea
instead of one?

318
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,581
Or is it good to grab
a bit of healthy me time?

319
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,706
It can oil the wheels
after all.

320
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,413
What do you think?

321
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,248
- Mike in Barnet, hello.
- Hi, Jeff.

322
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,706
Yeah, it sounds silly,
but we like... we like

323
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,038
doing everything
together, whatever it is.

324
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,538
Even if it is just getting a
Chinky on a Saturday night.

325
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,538
Ooh, fried rice. Nice.

326
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,623
We just love it, slobbing in
front of the telly. Perfect.

327
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,581
Oh, thank you
for that, Mike.

328
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,956
You mean a Chinese,
of course, don't you?

329
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,788
Apologies
on Mike's behalf.

330
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,956
But you're right.

331
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,998
Maybe that's the secret
of all.

332
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:47,290
Oh.

333
00:24:56,665 --> 00:24:58,250
How did that..

334
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:14,248
...I'd have
been worth a fortune.

335
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,165
What the..

336
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,750
Ah.

337
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:33,081
...about, you know,
you've got to have this

338
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,206
and you've got
to have that

339
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,663
and they forget
the simple things

340
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,498
you know,
like holding hands.

341
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,163
My husband had a stroke
a few years ago

342
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:45,456
and, um, he has been
bedridden ever since

343
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,081
but I see him every day
without fail.

344
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,331
I hold his hand,
I tell him..

345
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,081
Oh, well,
that makes you a saint

346
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,206
you silly old bitch.

347
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,790
Oh, Jesus Christ!

348
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,540
Bloody hell.

349
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,833
I don't..

350
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,873
Hello?

351
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,456
Oh, Jesus!

352
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,833
Oh.

353
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,873
Marek? Marek?

354
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,248
Pick up, please,
it's Tony.

355
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,413
Hello, Tony.

356
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:09,373
Listen, have you been over
here to this building?

357
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:12,040
Mm, no.
I am in other one.

358
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:18,081
I don't like
this place, Tony.

359
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,416
It feels... bad.

360
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:24,913
We have, um

361
00:27:24,915 --> 00:27:27,956
we have a word
for this back home.

362
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:31,208
It is zloslivy.

363
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:37,163
Look, don't, um..

364
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:39,790
don't let them thoughts get
into your head, mate, alright?

365
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,790
Get yourself a radio,
sunbeam. Yeah?

366
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,456
Look, I'm gonna, uh,
take a walk around, right?

367
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,873
You sit tight
for 10 minutes

368
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,663
and I'll call you
when I get back, alright?

369
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:54,663
Okay.
Thank you a lot, Tony.

370
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:56,000
Alright, mate.

371
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,790
Hello?

372
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,625
Is anyone there?

373
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,957
Marek? Marek?

374
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,082
Dada?

375
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,456
It is a coma.
A probable lock-in.

376
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,623
He is here for keeps.

377
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:23,998
Just one of those things.

378
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,040
The lights are on
and nobody's home.

379
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,956
Marek?

380
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,081
Right, listen.

381
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,038
You've got two minutes to
get out of this buildin'

382
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,875
before I come for ya.

383
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:16,457
Marek, if that's you..

384
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:23,083
What.. I can't believe this.

385
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,375
Hello?

386
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:28,666
Oh, what the bloody..

387
00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:32,082
Oh.

388
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,458
I'm not fuckin' about.

389
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:48,083
Right. Yeah? Yeah?

390
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,081
Shit.

391
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:22,246
Dada.

392
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,874
I'm comin' in.

393
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,331
Yeah. I got you now.

394
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,458
Yeah.

395
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,583
Let me out! Let me out!

396
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,083
Shit.

397
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,958
What the..

398
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,414
Dada!

399
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,498
Do you know what brought
Tony back to the church?

400
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,248
Uh, you know,
I am not comfortable

401
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,373
talking so directly
about a parishioner.

402
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,039
I'm assuming you have Tony's
permission to talk to me?

403
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,498
Yeah, yeah, of course.

404
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,164
But I can..

405
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,831
I mean, I can ask you some
more indirect questions

406
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,414
if you're comfortable
with that?

407
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,664
- Yes.
- Okay. Great.

408
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,833
Um, so..

409
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,456
So what do you think
is your responsibility

410
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:55,414
when a grown man like Tony
comes to you and says

411
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,331
that they've had
a supernatural experience?

412
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:03,164
You know, uh, when I was
a school's chaplain

413
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,123
I would always say
to the boys

414
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,331
"Age is not important
to the Lord.

415
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,750
We are all children
before Him."

416
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,498
If He wants you to believe

417
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,914
He will send you a sign.

418
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:19,039
That is what
these experiences are.

419
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,373
Signs.

420
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,414
Sure, but..

421
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,456
Uh, Tony, with Tony, uh..

422
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:27,748
Presumably, Tony told you
about his incident?

423
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,789
Of course.

424
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,789
The spirit.
The unquiet spirit.

425
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,081
Yeah.

426
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,331
So for a moment

427
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,539
let's hypothesize that
that really happened...

428
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,623
Oh, you do not need
to hypothesize.

429
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,289
It did happen.

430
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,748
Tony testifies
that he saw a spirit

431
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,458
and he changed
his ways accordingly.

432
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,373
But in what way
is that not real?

433
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:52,039
Oh, of course, for Tony's
sighting to be taken seriously

434
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,456
there's got to be some
sort of material evidence.

435
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,831
Because without that,
it's, uh, you know..

436
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,831
Tony has got so much
emotional baggage.

437
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,666
Baggage? We... We are
talking about a man.

438
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,416
Our brother.

439
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,123
I'm so tired
of this modern disregard

440
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,123
for the spiritual life.

441
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:16,373
How unfashionable it's become
to believe in anything

442
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,500
other than
our own personal gains.

443
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:24,539
Did Tony tell you what he did
after he had that experience?

444
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,706
No.

445
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,331
He went to see his
daughter, Marnie, again

446
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,914
the very next day.

447
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:33,331
And when she heard
her father's voice

448
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,581
for the first time
in five years

449
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:39,456
the doctor said
her heart skipped a beat.

450
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:43,123
That, I think, professor

451
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,623
tells us everything
we need to know

452
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:50,458
about the reality of that
experience and its value.

453
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,623
You, Mr. Goodman,
would do well

454
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,458
to think about that with
regard to your own family.

455
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,875
Good day.

456
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,623
Who is it?

457
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,081
Uh, it's
Professor Philip Goodman.

458
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,916
We spoke on the phone.

459
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,539
Do you have an ID
or anything?

460
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:10,123
You might not be the man
that I spoke to.

461
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,581
I am.

462
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,373
Oh, okay. Here you go.

463
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,333
You sent that
to Charles Cameron.

464
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,541
Come in.

465
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,875
I'll be upstairs, mom.

466
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,791
Professor Goodman?

467
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:55,750
Simon?

468
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,666
Simon?

469
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,706
- Down here.
- Oh.

470
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,000
Jesus.

471
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,333
Demon.

472
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,541
- Sit down.

473
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,666
Please,
don't touch my books.

474
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,748
God, it's boiling
in here, Simon.

475
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,664
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.

476
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:11,664
I just get really cold

477
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:12,831
and really uncomfortable

478
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:14,873
so I just like it
to be as comfort..

479
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,206
I just like it
how I like it.

480
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,416
Wow.

481
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,375
Uh, so..

482
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,956
So what are all these..

483
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,289
Where are
these pictures from?

484
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,956
They're from...
They're from all over.

485
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:37,789
It's my research.

486
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,123
Stuff that I find
on the internet

487
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,164
or books that I'm reading.

488
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,373
Stuff I'm interested in.

489
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,831
I'm just trying to
understand certain things.

490
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,081
So it's helpful
to have all that stuff out

491
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,623
so I can see it
all the time.

492
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,873
Or at least
whenever I want to see it.

493
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,248
If I don't wanna see it,
I can look over there.

494
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,289
The thing
that I don't want..

495
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:54,831
I don't want people
looking at me and thinking

496
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,081
that I'm mad
'cause I know what I saw.

497
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,914
And that's the thing.
I'm tired.

498
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,873
I'm so tired
and I'm finding it hard

499
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:01,998
to think straight right now.

500
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,206
But, I mean,
I want to talk about this.

501
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,289
I wanna find out
about this

502
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,164
but I don't want
people to think..

503
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,789
I just want everything
to be straight now.

504
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:11,789
No frayed edges,
no loose ends.

505
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,750
All straight. All smooth.

506
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:15,875
I don't want..

507
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,623
I don't want
people thinking that

508
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:22,791
there's anything
wr... wrong with me.

509
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,375
I see.

510
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,000
You okay?

511
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:36,791
Yeah.

512
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:41,916
Okay.

513
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,708
So..

514
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,164
...who else is up here
with us

515
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,039
in the...
in the upstairs room?

516
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,206
No one. It's just us.

517
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,581
No, sorry.
In the top bedroom?

518
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,248
- My brother's old room.
- Right. Your brother.

519
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,539
So is he still
living at home?

520
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,164
Well, Mr. Perfect..

521
00:44:58,166 --> 00:45:01,623
No, he's 25 and married.
He's got a flat.

522
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:03,583
There's no one here.
It's just us.

523
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:07,623
- Sorry, I was just up...
- There's nobody here.

524
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,956
I'm telling you
there's nobody here.

525
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,916
Do you wanna go and look?

526
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,166
- No.
- Fine then.

527
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:32,583
Can you go away, please?
We're trying to talk.

528
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,331
Do you not get on well
with your parents?

529
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,291
They don't care about me.

530
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:47,458
I know you're still there!

531
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,625
Can you help me?

532
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,875
I'll try.

533
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,706
All I need you to do
is to just..

534
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:13,914
...just tell me everything
you can about that night.

535
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,956
Everything.

536
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:18,039
If I can just understand
what happened

537
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,166
then everything
will be fine.

538
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,000
Okay.

539
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:33,998
I'm not the same person
now as I was. It's..

540
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,916
The world is
n... not the same.

541
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,208
Oh, God.
I feel like such an idiot.

542
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,666
Why?

543
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:49,833
Yeah.

544
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,583
I was driving
my dad's car.

545
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:56,956
I failed my test

546
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,125
but I was too afraid
to tell them.

547
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,083
I pretended
that I had passed.

548
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,208
I was driving
without a license.

549
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,664
- Hello?
- Where are you?

550
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,539
I'm in the car. I am on the
way back from the party.

551
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,039
Oh, thank God.

552
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,039
He's in the car, Raymond.

553
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:01,164
We've been trying to call you.
Where have you been?

554
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:03,123
I... I'm sorry. There's no
reception near Eddie's.

555
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,123
We've been sitting here
on shpilkes.

556
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:06,789
You should have been
back hours ago.

557
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,289
Should have been back
hours ago!

558
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:11,123
Oh, Raymond, for God's
sake, I'm trying to talk..

559
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:12,083
Hello?

560
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,373
Hello?

561
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,748
Your mother's
gone to bed.

562
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,123
We are very upset.

563
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,081
Dad, I didn't put
the phone down on you.

564
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,081
Oh.

565
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:36,039
And I'm sorry
that I'm late.

566
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,414
I just found that bloody
housing form for university

567
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,123
that you should have
sent in three weeks ago.

568
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,581
You told me
you'd sent it!

569
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:44,123
Well, I... I thought...
I thought that I had.

570
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:46,164
You're a bloody liar,
Simon.

571
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,456
You're a liar.

572
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,039
You might be able
to schmooze your mother

573
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,789
but you cannot
schmooze me.

574
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,414
You lied about that form.

575
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:54,498
You lied about getting that
Saturday job, didn't you?

576
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,206
What are we gonna
find out next?

577
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,914
That you lied about passing
your driving test?

578
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,206
- Shit.
- I'll tell you what.

579
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,166
I'm sick
to the bloody back teeth.

580
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,916
Shit.

581
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,581
Don't you put the bloody
phone down on me!

582
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,164
I... I... I didn't put
the phone down on you.

583
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,289
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

584
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,164
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my..

585
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:29,333
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

586
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,208
You okay?

587
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,916
Oh, my God.

588
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,750
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

589
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,083
No signal.

590
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,125
Come on.

591
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,166
Fucking O2.

592
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,414
- Hello? National Breakdown.
- Hello.

593
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:32,625
Can you give me the car's
registration, please?

594
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,666
Just give me one second.

595
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:43,458
AG57-EOZ.

596
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,373
Thank you.
And is that Mr. Rif-kind?

597
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,664
Rifkind. Yes.

598
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,539
I'm Simon. I'm his son.

599
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:53,789
Okay, Simon.

600
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,831
And are you with the car
right now?

601
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,208
Hello, Simon?

602
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,914
Yes.

603
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,331
Yes, I'm right by the car.

604
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,539
Okay,
we have you on the GPS

605
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:12,373
so we know exactly where you
are and we'll be with you

606
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:15,914
somewhere between 10
and 45 minutes, okay?

607
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,623
Please come
as quickly as you can.

608
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,831
Thank you, Mr. Rif-kind.
Goodbye.

609
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:22,208
Rifkind!

610
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:43,414
What have I done?
What have I done?

611
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:16,625
Hello?

612
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,958
God, I'm... I'm so sorry.

613
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:59,791
- Stay!
- Fuck that!

614
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:13,208
The supernatural are unseen
forces that surround us.

615
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:34,706
Charles,
I've now investigated

616
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,875
two of your cases
quite thoroughly.

617
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:41,206
It feels quite simple
to me, really.

618
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:42,664
The brain sees
what it wants to see.

619
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,873
They're your words,
Charles.

620
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:46,498
Tony Matthews
is an alcoholic

621
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,331
who's wrestling
with unresolved grief.

622
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,706
And Simon
is a fragile young man

623
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,706
and from a deeply
dysfunctional family

624
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,206
who's on the edge
of psychosis.

625
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,998
I understand
all too well, Charles

626
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,414
how easy it is
to get confused

627
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:14,664
and to lose faith
in one's own judgment.

628
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:18,458
Especially when we're
tired and emotional..

629
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,583
...and unwell.

630
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,081
What the..

631
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:58,706
Keep up, Goodman.

632
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,498
Thing is, I'm the soppy one
if you can believe that.

633
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,456
I wanted kids from the
moment we got together

634
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,123
but Maria said, "No, it's
not gonna happen, babe."

635
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:06,123
Maria is your wife, yeah?

636
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,289
Yeah, of course, she is.

637
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:08,664
Do you know why
she didn't want children?

638
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:10,998
Presumably, you were
comfortable financially.

639
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,623
Oh, Jesus.

640
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,539
That's all your lot ever think
about, isn't it? Money.

641
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:17,581
Sorry, what exactly
do you mean by your lot?

642
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:18,748
No way
was she getting pregnant

643
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,706
until she was made
a partner at the firm.

644
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,331
Her words, not mine.

645
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,789
Priorities.

646
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,873
Someone's got to earn
the money

647
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,664
so you brainy poofters
can sit around

648
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:28,414
stroking your chins
and pulling onion

649
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:29,789
out of your arses
all day long.

650
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:32,289
Oh, hang on.

651
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,164
Yeah, I've got to do this.

652
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:36,123
Right.

653
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:53,581
Alright.

654
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,498
Can we, please,
talk about the incident?

655
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,206
Do you know what they used to
call me when I was trading?

656
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,373
- No.
- The prophet.

657
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:59,914
I had a sixth sense
of what was going up

658
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,831
and what was coming down.

659
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,623
This isn't about
the financial markets.

660
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,666
I know what it is
you're asking about.

661
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:11,791
I know.

662
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:16,000
Come on then, up there.

663
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,914
I made a killing
in the city.

664
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:27,081
Uh, I built the house.
Real investment property.

665
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:29,831
And that's where the incident
happened, at the house?

666
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,456
When Maria
finally got partnership

667
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:34,956
bingo,
time to have a baby.

668
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,664
But she was pushing 40
when we started though.

669
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:40,873
So, yeah,
she had left it too late.

670
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:44,206
She was drier than the
Gobi Desert down there.

671
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:45,706
Still,
I said not to worry.

672
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,331
A splash of IVF

673
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,289
get the old baby machine
working again.

674
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,164
I'd been to school with the
top guy in that field.

675
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:55,831
So, uh, yeah, 30 grand
later, bull's eye.

676
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:57,748
The old girl
is finally up the duff.

677
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,623
Oh, why is it always the last
key that unlocks everything?

678
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,539
Hm?

679
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,748
Et voila.

680
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,831
So, yeah, everything
was going great

681
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:15,164
and then seven months in

682
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,748
she suddenly
started spotting.

683
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,789
So we pop her into a clinic
for a couple of days.

684
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:21,706
Best care money can buy.

685
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,248
It was more
like the bloody Savoy!

686
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:26,748
So I dropped her off.

687
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,081
Popped home
to do some paperwork.

688
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,164
Okay, what time was that?

689
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:32,208
It was..

690
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,914
Quarter to 4:00, hm.

691
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,041
Hm.

692
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,125
Hm.

693
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:50,625
Hm.

694
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:31,956
You're telling me you
actually saw that happen?

695
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:33,956
It's my understanding
that a poltergeist

696
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:36,748
is an evil spirit
or an angry spirit.

697
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,289
- Is that true?
- No, it's not.

698
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,123
There's absolutely no
evidence to support that.

699
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:42,956
Hm.

700
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:45,164
The guys at the hospital
took Maria in for a scan

701
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:47,206
but they didn't
wanna show us.

702
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,956
They said
there were distortions

703
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,081
on the screen
or something.

704
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,748
Sorry.

705
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,623
I'm right in the middle
of this Chinese thing.

706
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:03,414
Yeah, so the scan..

707
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,539
What..

708
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:12,498
A bit, uh,
bit chilly, prof?

709
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,998
Sorry, I, uh..

710
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,083
Have you ever killed
anything, Mr. Goodman?

711
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,331
Certainly not.

712
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,500
Nothing
you'll admit to, eh?

713
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,456
The doctors
thought it best

714
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,456
that Maria spend another
night in the hospital

715
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,248
so I went back
to the house.

716
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,000
I had a stack of work
to do.

717
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:35,706
You're supposed to feel
safe in your own home

718
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,041
aren't you, Mr. Goodman?

719
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:40,083
Do you believe in evil,
professor?

720
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,623
I didn't..

721
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,166
...until that night.

722
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,083
Maria?

723
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:02,250
Maria?

724
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,957
We are dead.

725
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,580
Why aren't you
in the hospital?

726
01:10:26,832 --> 01:10:28,582
I managed to get out
of the room.

727
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:33,080
I don't know how long I'd been
standing there when the phone rang.

728
01:10:33,082 --> 01:10:34,625
It was the hospital.

729
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:39,083
I knew what they were
going to tell me.

730
01:10:41,207 --> 01:10:42,414
The prophet.

731
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,500
Apparently,
the birth was..

732
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,125
He split her in two.

733
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:00,705
I'm glad
Maria never lived to see

734
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:02,330
what Barty looked like.

735
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:03,875
That would have
destroyed her.

736
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:09,875
No one believed that Barty
would have survived this long.

737
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:15,664
But somehow
life... finds a way.

738
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,791
It's what I've learned,
that, uh..

739
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:21,250
...life goes on.

740
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,373
What?

741
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,080
Fuck. Fuck.

742
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:01,666
Um..

743
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,789
Mr. Cameron, I didn't know
you were here.

744
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,205
I know exactly
what's going on.

745
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:11,164
Oh, thank God. What?

746
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:14,664
This whole thing's a stupid,
shitty hoax to get you back on TV.

747
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,414
It's a way of usurping me.

748
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:19,789
You are a lonely, jealous, bitter
old man, and that's the truth.

749
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:22,123
Mr. Goodman, you wouldn't
know the truth

750
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,873
if it kissed you
on the lips.

751
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,289
Well, I know this!

752
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:28,039
There is nothing
in any of these stories

753
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:29,539
that couldn't be
explained away

754
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,414
by any intelligent
five-year-old.

755
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:32,623
Nothing!

756
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:37,830
You just can't find it
in yourself.

757
01:12:37,832 --> 01:12:40,000
Can you, Philip?

758
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:44,998
You can't find
the humility

759
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,289
to admit that perhaps,
just perhaps

760
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,748
things are not always
as they seem.

761
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:56,539
And that is precisely
my point.

762
01:12:56,541 --> 01:13:01,580
Everything, everything
is exactly as it seems.

763
01:13:01,582 --> 01:13:04,748
You sure about that?

764
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,205
Yes.

765
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,582
You don't know
everything.

766
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:50,664
Do you, bubala?

767
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,414
Oh.

768
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:16,416
Sorry, can we cut?

769
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:20,833
Who are you talking to?

770
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,080
Philip..

771
01:14:24,082 --> 01:14:25,832
...the brain sees..

772
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,998
...what it wants to see.

773
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,830
Oh, I really wanna
show you something.

774
01:14:31,832 --> 01:14:33,000
May I?

775
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,625
Um..

776
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:21,914
In you come.

777
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:23,083
Come on.

778
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:25,664
It will just be
the four of us.

779
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:30,123
You, me, Barty and, uh..

780
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,500
...you know who.

781
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:03,955
One last chance,
Mr. Goodman.

782
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:05,539
Anything
you want to tell me?

783
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:07,330
About what? I'm..

784
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:09,665

01:16:20,416 --> 01:16:21,998
Okay, you weren't
at school with me.

788
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,750
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

789
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,705
Mr. Brain Box,
clever clogs

790
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:29,164
overachiever,
living on his own

791
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:30,705
there's no one
there at home.

792
01:16:30,707 --> 01:16:33,248
Dare you turn some of that
prize-nominated

793
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:36,041
never-quite-winning acuity
onto yourself?

794
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:39,958
11, 92, 20?

795
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:43,666
Ah.

796
01:16:46,707 --> 01:16:48,332
Come on. Ahem.

797
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:59,208
Wait, wait, please.

798
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,083
I don't like it.

799
01:17:29,207 --> 01:17:30,750
Do you want to go in?

800
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,875
I can't.

801
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:47,830
That's on my shirt!

802
01:17:47,832 --> 01:17:49,955
What are you doing, man?

803
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,665
- Yuck.
- Hey.

804
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:56,664
Oi, Jewface!

805
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:57,791
Oi, Jewface!

806
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,373
Come here.

807
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:04,289
- I've got to go home.
- Come here.

808
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,789
I've got to go home
for my tea.

809
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,789
Or what? Your fat pig
of a mom will eat it?

810
01:18:10,207 --> 01:18:12,830
I won't tell you again,
mate.

811
01:18:12,832 --> 01:18:13,750
Get here.

812
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:16,540
Come on.

813
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:20,248
I'm not going
in there again, Freer.

814
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,830
I'm not going
in there again, Freer.

815
01:18:21,832 --> 01:18:23,830
Oh, don't shit yourself.
It is not a gas chamber.

816
01:18:25,082 --> 01:18:26,332
Stand over there.

817
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:28,916
Go on.

818
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,373
Yes!

819
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,830
- Alright, pick one up.
- I don't wanna.

820
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:56,330
I don't give a shit
what you want.

821
01:18:56,332 --> 01:18:58,498
Pick it up!

822
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,541
Go on.

823
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:03,580
Put it
in front of your face.

824
01:19:03,582 --> 01:19:05,957
- What?
- In front of your face!

825
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:10,165
Now don't you
fucking move.

826
01:19:20,082 --> 01:19:21,705
What are you playing?

827
01:19:22,707 --> 01:19:23,830
What is going on here?

828
01:19:23,832 --> 01:19:26,375
Hey, Kojak!
Hey, come here, mate.

829
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,414
Oh, my God.

830
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:31,623
Come on, mate, quick.

831
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:33,039
Hey, Kojak.

832
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,164
- Wanna be in our gang?
- Can I?

833
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,330
Yeah, of course, you can,
mate, if you're cool enough.

834
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:38,373
Do you think
you're cool enough?

835
01:19:41,207 --> 01:19:42,455
Where do you think
you're going, Jewface?

836
01:19:42,457 --> 01:19:44,080
- I need to get home.
- No, bollocks.

837
01:19:44,082 --> 01:19:45,289
You're staying here.

838
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:46,789
You're gonna watch Kojak
do the 10th number.

839
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,039
Yeah, stay and watch.

840
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:49,955
Leave him alone, Freer.
You know he can't count.

841
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:51,664
Yeah, I can.
I can count to 100.

842
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:53,748
See?

843
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,498
Right, come here.
Come here.

844
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,289
You see that
on the side of the Echo?

845
01:19:58,291 --> 01:20:00,955
- What number is it?
- Six.

846
01:20:00,957 --> 01:20:03,998
Yeah.
Well done. Well done.

847
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,248
That's the first number
of 10 different numbers

848
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,539
I've chalked up
on the walls in there.

849
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,455
All you have to do
to be in our gang

850
01:20:10,457 --> 01:20:14,123
is go in, right the
way in, keep walking

851
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:16,123
until you find
all 10 of the numbers

852
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:19,914
and then remember which
is the 10th one, yeah?

853
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:22,248
- Callahan, there aren't...
- Mate!

854
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,955
I just need to remember
the 10th one?

855
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:25,998
Yeah, you only need
to remember the 10th one.

856
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,330
Now you've got to look
carefully 'cause some of them

857
01:20:27,332 --> 01:20:29,539
are quite far apart. Yeah?

858
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,123
Shut up!

859
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:33,830
Now when you come out and tell
me what that 10th number is

860
01:20:33,832 --> 01:20:36,832
if you tell me the correct
number, you can be in our gang.

861
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,830
Yeah? I'll start now.

862
01:20:40,832 --> 01:20:43,830
Now hang on.
You're gonna need this.

863
01:20:43,832 --> 01:20:46,373
It gets quite dark
in there.

864
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,955
Alright. Go get that
10th number then.

865
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:50,457
- Go on.
- Yay!

866
01:21:02,582 --> 01:21:03,790
Go on.

867
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,039
Six.

868
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,039
Good start.

869
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,041
79.

870
01:21:31,457 --> 01:21:33,000
19.

871
01:21:40,457 --> 01:21:42,248
- What were you gonna say to him?
- Nothing.

872
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,123
You were gonna tell him there's
no 10th number, weren't you?

873
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,373
No, I wasn't.

874
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:46,455
I bet you weren't
gonna tell him

875
01:21:46,457 --> 01:21:47,873
you shit yourself
when you tried it.

876
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,080
So keep it zipped
or else..

877
01:21:50,082 --> 01:21:51,830
Alright?

878
01:21:51,832 --> 01:21:53,125
20.

879
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,705
48.

880
01:22:02,707 --> 01:22:04,705
I don't like it.
I wanna come out now.

881
01:22:04,707 --> 01:22:06,750
Oh, don't give up now.

882
01:22:07,832 --> 01:22:08,914
Please!

883
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:10,500
Oh, keep goin'.

884
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:18,414
I wanna come out.
It's really narrow.

885
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:20,414
Don't you fucking dare,
Kojak!

886
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:21,789
We're not letting you
out of there

887
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:23,916
until you find that
10th number, alright?

888
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,041
Callahan!

889
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,208
Callahan!

890
01:23:46,207 --> 01:23:48,498
You left him to die
in there, didn't you?

891
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,664
What could I have done?

892
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,623
Told someone
when you got home?

893
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:53,580
Brought it up
in assembly the next day?

894
01:23:53,582 --> 01:23:54,830
How about running
into the Echo

895
01:23:54,832 --> 01:23:56,123
to see
if Desmond needed help?

896
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,123
It was a fluke,
just one of those things.

897
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,080
- A horrible accident.
- How convenient for you.

898
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:01,414
We didn't know
he was asthmatic.

899
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,789
The only fluke here
is the fluke in his DNA

900
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,373
that left him vulnerable
to people like you.

901
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:09,164
People like me?

902
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:13,164
I've spent my life
trying to help people

903
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:14,539
tryin' to put back in

904
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:16,580
tryin' to help people
see the truth

905
01:24:16,582 --> 01:24:20,455
in amongst the sea of
sentimental lies and crap.

906
01:24:20,457 --> 01:24:21,748
That's...

907
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:24,205
Don't laugh at me!

908
01:24:24,207 --> 01:24:26,664
I wasn't the one
who made him go in there.

909
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:31,455
I wasn't the one who called
him Kojak to his face

910
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:34,205
and I wasn't the one who
wouldn't let him come out

911
01:24:34,207 --> 01:24:36,414
when he wanted to.
I did nothing.

912
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:38,666
That's right.
You did nothing.

913
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:41,830
You passenger.

914
01:24:41,832 --> 01:24:44,455
And since then how have you
spent your days, Mr. Goodman?

915
01:24:44,457 --> 01:24:47,205
Reducing life's biggest questions
to atoms and molecules?

916
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,580
It is just
atoms and molecules.

917
01:24:48,582 --> 01:24:50,123
What else is there,
for God's sake?

918
01:24:56,207 --> 01:24:59,082
Hello, here I come.

919
01:25:00,082 --> 01:25:01,790
Here I come.

920
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,623
Barty, shh, it's okay.

921
01:25:05,625 --> 01:25:07,332
Look, look, look.

922
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,955
Look, it's alright.
Daddy's got meow-meow.

923
01:25:10,957 --> 01:25:12,040
It's alright.

924
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:18,705
Here we go, a big one.

925
01:25:18,707 --> 01:25:21,580
Open wide. Open wide.
Yeah.

926
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:24,664
Yes. Good boy.

927
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:25,958
Good boy.

928
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:28,250
Good boy.

929
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:35,289
Good boy, Barty.

930
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:37,333
Oh, there's a good boy.

931
01:25:41,207 --> 01:25:42,625
Mr. Goodman,

932
01:25:44,082 --> 01:25:46,080
for all your clever talk

933
01:25:46,082 --> 01:25:48,705
you're really more scared
than anyone, aren't you?

934
01:25:48,707 --> 01:25:52,789
And what you've actually been doing
with your life isn't helping others

935
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:56,039
it's running
from your greatest fear

936
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:59,414
which is that there's more
than the here and now

937
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,248
and that every action
you've ever taken

938
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:04,000
or didn't take
has had an effect.

939
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,582
It's left a little trace.

940
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:10,123
A ghost of itself.

941
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:11,500
That's true, isn't it?

942
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:17,583
Shh.

943
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,998
Shh.

944
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,291
He's asleep.

945
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:28,289
- Shh.
- Shh.

946
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,458
Come on.

947
01:26:33,082 --> 01:26:34,748
Shh.

948
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,914
Please.

949
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,500
Callahan.

950
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:01,375
Callahan, I'm so sorry!

951
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:12,830
Oh, no.

952
01:27:12,832 --> 01:27:15,330
Oh, no. Not, not again.

953
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:21,125
Please.

954
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:29,500
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

955
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:34,789
Callahan,
please, please, please.

956
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,458
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

957
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:39,250
Please.

958
01:27:43,332 --> 01:27:45,500
Callahan. Callahan.

959
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:05,830
...and just went mad.

960
01:29:05,832 --> 01:29:07,580
"That's typical of you,"
she said.

961
01:29:07,582 --> 01:29:09,623
"Lord Muck, always
thinking of himself."

962
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:13,164
Yes, I know I missed
last Friday night, mom.

963
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:15,705
I'm sorry. Um, well,
you could tell dad

964
01:29:15,707 --> 01:29:19,080
that I will be there
this Friday, okay?

965
01:29:19,082 --> 01:29:22,205
Please, mom, I'm at work.

966
01:29:22,207 --> 01:29:23,540
I've gotta go.

967
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,625
Love you too. Bye.

968
01:29:29,582 --> 01:29:31,332
- Ah.
- Mr. Priddle.

969
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,498
Ah, yes.
"Professor Philip Goodman

970
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,830
"admitted April 13,
3:45 a.m.

971
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:41,373
attempted suicide."

972
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:44,916
"Failed
self-asphyxiation in his car."

973
01:29:45,957 --> 01:29:47,205
Silly bugger.

974
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:48,748
Shotgun in the mouth,
that's the way to do it!

975
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,541
Oh, better see this.

976
01:29:53,582 --> 01:29:55,580
Mm-hmm.

977
01:29:55,582 --> 01:29:56,832
Ha!

978
01:30:02,582 --> 01:30:03,875
Right.

979
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:09,789
Neurological examination
reveals

980
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:12,580
fixed and dilated pupils.

981
01:30:12,582 --> 01:30:15,789
So what's our verdict,
Dr. Rif-kind?

982
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:18,164
Rifkind, uh..

983
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:19,873
It, uh, coma.

984
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:21,830
Uh, probable lock-in.

985
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:23,289
He is here for keeps.

986
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:24,664
Yeah, just one
of those things.

987
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:27,458
Lights are on,
there's nobody home.

988
01:30:30,332 --> 01:30:32,998
Well, as my old professor
Charlie Cameron used to say

989
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,164
"Let's just hope
his dreams are as sweet.

990
01:30:35,166 --> 01:30:37,373
Next room, laddie,
next room."

991
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:38,539
Ha!

992
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:54,541
Hello again, sunbeam.

993
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:57,291
Don't mind me.

994
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:03,833
Love has a way
of, um, conquering.

995
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:09,039
Hi, Jeff.
Yes, it sounds silly

996
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:10,455
but we like...
we like doing

997
01:31:10,457 --> 01:31:12,539
everything together,
whatever it is.

998
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:14,914
Even if it is just getting a
Chinky on a Saturday night.

999
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:16,833
Ooh, fried rice. Nice.

1000
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:20,664
Alright.

1001
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:22,955
See you tomorrow.

1002
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:24,290
Be good.

1003
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,832
Here we go, sunbeam.

1004
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,457
A little change
of scenery.

1005
