We have a plan. If we can...

You can't think your way
out of this one.

1121
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:34,321
I was one of
the first Black doctors

1122
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:35,890
to graduate from Cambridge
with medical degree.

1123
01:22:35,923 --> 01:22:37,257
Have I told you that?

1124
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:38,625
Well, that's very nice
for you...

1125
01:22:38,659 --> 01:22:40,527
I applied to all the best
hospitals in the country.

1126
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,263
Immediately, I was told there
were no positions available.

1127
01:22:43,296 --> 01:22:46,934
I fought tooth and nail
for my education,

1128
01:22:46,968 --> 01:22:49,569
and yet no one
would let me practice it.

1129
01:22:49,603 --> 01:22:52,472
Finally, I was offered
a position by post.

1130
01:22:52,506 --> 01:22:56,476
Royal physician to King Carol
the First of Romania.

1131
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,479
My name,
it reached them somehow.

1132
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,383
But the color of my skin,
it would later seem, had not.

1133
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:15,529
Captain Eliot once asked me
over dinner

1134
01:23:15,562 --> 01:23:17,497
what I most desired.

1135
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:20,634
I told him I wanted
the world to make sense.

1136
01:23:22,737 --> 01:23:28,208
I need this world
to make sense, Mr. Wojchek.

1137
01:23:29,777 --> 01:23:32,245
This beast--

1138
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:36,383
and mark my words,
it is a beast--

1139
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,518
deep down,
I need it to make sense, too.

1140
01:23:38,552 --> 01:23:39,619
I need to know why

1141
01:23:39,653 --> 01:23:41,989
it is the way it is
and why it does what it does.

1142
01:23:42,023 --> 01:23:43,590
And then I will remind
the beast that it,

1143
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:46,828
like the world,
has absolutely no hold over me.

1144
01:23:46,861 --> 01:23:48,730
And then?

1145
01:23:49,629 --> 01:23:52,299
And then I want to kill
the cursed thing.

1146
01:23:55,002 --> 01:23:57,537
If we barricade this cabin,

1147
01:23:57,571 --> 01:24:00,607
we are a day from London
with this wind.

1148
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,677
Can't set more sail,
crew what it is.

1149

1150

WOJCHEK: It ran
from our guns in the night.

1152
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:10,383
It won't risk
an outright attack.

1153
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:12,352
-ANNA: Running?
-It's...

1154
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:14,621
It was not running.

1155
01:24:14,654 --> 01:24:15,923
(gun clicking)

1156
01:24:15,957 --> 01:24:17,491
It was rationing.

1157
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:20,594
Rationing?

1158
01:24:22,696 --> 01:24:24,766
(gun racks)

1159
01:24:26,968 --> 01:24:28,903
One a night.

1160
01:24:28,936 --> 01:24:32,807
Once we had hit open waters
and could no longer make port.

1161
01:24:35,943 --> 01:24:38,478
It hid below deck,

1162
01:24:38,512 --> 01:24:42,282
sustaining off Anna until then.

1163
01:24:44,852 --> 01:24:47,420
But now it has us right where
it wants us, doesn't it?

1164
01:24:47,454 --> 01:24:50,290
Like he said,
London's only a day away.

1165
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:53,593
It no longer needs us.

1166
01:24:53,627 --> 01:24:57,664
So we have to kill it
before it reaches the coast.

1167
01:24:57,697 --> 01:24:59,332
ABRAMS:
Kill it?

1168
01:24:59,366 --> 01:25:01,869
We can't even find it.

1169
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:04,071
No, we can't.

1170
01:25:04,105 --> 01:25:06,439
It is why we're to set a trap.

1171
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:08,575
We must sink the ship.

1172
01:25:08,608 --> 01:25:10,410
With him on it.

1173
01:25:10,443 --> 01:25:11,813
Scuttle the <i>Demeter?</i>

1174
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:13,781
Have you gone mad?!

1175
01:25:13,815 --> 01:25:15,515
CLEMENS:
She's right.

1176
01:25:15,549 --> 01:25:17,484
We set up an ambush and
leave it on the sinking ship.

1177
01:25:17,517 --> 01:25:19,954
Then we can escape
on one of the lifeboats.

1178
01:25:19,987 --> 01:25:22,890
If the course is right, we
should be able to make shore.

1179
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:24,524
This is my home.

1180
01:25:24,558 --> 01:25:28,963
And I won't tear her apart
for this fucking thing!

1181
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:30,430
I grew up on a boat,
Mr. Wojchek.

1182
01:25:30,463 --> 01:25:32,432
Just like this one.

1183
01:25:32,465 --> 01:25:35,036
My father was a deckhand
his whole life.

1184
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:37,404
He always told me that the...

1185
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:41,374
the ship, the living part,

1186
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:42,710
is the men on board.

1187
01:25:42,743 --> 01:25:43,978
The crews.

1188
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:46,147
The stories.

1189
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,883
Everything else is
just timber and nails.

1190
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:51,484
No!

1191
01:25:53,955 --> 01:25:55,555
This is my home.

1192
01:25:57,959 --> 01:25:59,459
She's mine.

1193
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:08,803
It's going to be me.

1194
01:26:09,636 --> 01:26:11,806

The <i>Demet</i> is lost, sir.

1212
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:09,764
We're abandoning ship.

1213
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:12,867
Abandoning ship?

1214
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,969
Aye, sir.

1215
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:22,810
Mr. Wojchek's below deck making
preparations as we speak.

1216
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:25,246
We'll leave the beast
a sinking ship

1217
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:27,848
as a farewell gift. (gasps)

1218
01:27:31,986 --> 01:27:33,620
He comes to me.

1219
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:38,726
He whispers to me
behind my own eyes.

1220
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:44,098
He can bring Toby back.

1221
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:45,967
He took him away.
He can bring him back.

1222
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,600
Captain, come to your senses.

1223

I remember who I was.

1234
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:22,970
Before him.

1235
01:28:23,004 --> 01:28:27,975
But most often, I think of
the box he kept me in.

1236
01:28:29,176 --> 01:28:33,914
How every time he came for me
and tore into my flesh,

1237
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:36,717
drank his fill,

1238
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:39,920
dirt would seep into
the fresh wound,

1239
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:41,122
filling me up.

1240
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:44,125
You cannot sink the <i>Demeter.</i>

1241
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:46,027
Picture Toby's face.

1242
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:50,064
His smile, his laugh.

1243
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:53,167
And think of that dirt
filling him up, too,

1244
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,303
because that's
what the devil does.

1245
01:28:56,337 --> 01:29:00,640
He takes what is good
and what you love, and he...

1246
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:04,912
he uses it, and he twists it,
and he rots it from within.

1247
